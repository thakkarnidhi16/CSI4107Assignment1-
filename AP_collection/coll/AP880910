   Bob Hope wants to send country singer
Roy Clark ``to Russia with love,'' and played host of a
fund-raising dinner in pursuit of that goal.
   At Friday's dinner, Clark said he was eager to return to the
Soviet Union on his second goodwill tour.
   ``I guess I was the first person to introduce country music to
the Russians, and they loved it,'' Clark said. ``I, in turn, loved
them. They're just people, not so different from us.''
   Clark said work songs like ``Sixteen Tons'' were the
most-requested tunes when he first toured the Soviet Union in 1976.
   Clark, who stars on the television show ``Hee Haw,'' will give
12 concerts in Moscow and Leningrad on this tour, which is
partially funded by the U.S. Information Agency and the official
Soviet talent agency Gosconcert.
   Tennessee Sens. Albert Gore Jr. and Jim Sasser joined Hee Haw
co-star George Lindsey at the fund-raiser, which included some
light jabs at Clark by Hope.
   ``I send him to Russia, with love,'' Hope said. ``It's either
send him, or deport him. Who else would want him, except maybe his
wife?''

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Gilbert Becomes Hurricane In Caribbean</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE WITH Gilbert upgraded to

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Tropical Storm Gilbert strengthened into a
hurricane Saturday night in the Caribbean, boasting maximum
sustained winds of nearly 75 mph, forecasters said.
   Gilbert was expected drop 5 to 10 inches of rain on Puerto Rico
and the Dominican Republic by Sunday, the National Hurricane Center
said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Saturday, Gilbert was centered 225 miles
southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. It was near
latitude 16.0 north, longitude 67.3 west.
   Forecasters expected the storm to continue to strengthen.
   ``The system is becoming better organized,'' said Lixion Avila,
hurricane center meteorologist. ``The convection is becoming
concentrated in the center.''
   The storm was expected to continue moving west at near 15 mph
for the next 24 hours.
   The government of the Dominican Republic issued a hurricane
warning for the Barahona peninsula.
   Two weeks ago, a depression that later became Tropical Storm
Chris dumped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico, causing mudslides
and flooding blamed for three deaths and damage to more than 100
homes.
   Chris came ashore Aug. 28 at Charleston, S.C., destroying more
than a dozen mobile homes, killing one person, and leaving
thousands temporarily without power before losing steam over land.
   Meanwhile, the remnants of hurricane Florence moved into
Mississippi on Saturday while thousands of evacuated Louisiana
residents returned to their homes. Most found little damage from
the storm's 80 mph wind.
   Officials blamed Florence for one death.
   The 1988 Atlantic hurricane season has had eight named storms,
two of which strengthened into short-lived hurricanes.

   A black bear and a mule deer buck are
the first large animals confirmed killed by the forest fires in and
near Yellowstone National Park, and firefighters have been warned
to avoid any injured animals.
   Yellowstone National Park officials had repeatedly said that
larger animals such as deer, elk, bison and bear can easily
sidestep fires that advance normally.
   However, fires in the Yellowstone area have not behaved
normally. Veteran firefighters in and around the park say they have
never seen fire move so far, so quickly.
   The black bear was suffering from deep burns on its feet and was
unable to do more than lift its head Friday evening, said Tom
Safford, a highway patrolman who was given permission by state and
local officials to shoot and kill the suffering animal about a half
mile east of Silver Gate.
   ``All four pads were burned off the feet and down to the bone.
He must have run through a bunch of hot coals. It looked to me like
he would have been permanently immobile,'' Safford said.
   The bear, about 4 years old, had been seen lying in a marsh
about 200 yards above a highway for about 24 hours before it was
killed.
   Larry Folenius, safety officer on the Storm Creek fire, told
firefighters at Saturday's 6 a.m. briefing that there had been
sightings of some hurt bears and cautioned firefighters to be
careful around them if they were spotted.
   About seven miles west of where the bear was killed, the charred
carcass of a mature buck deer lay beside the road to Daisy Pass.
Fire scoured the area Wednesday. Another carcass was reported to be
nearby, but could not be located.

   A fishing expedition in the Ohio River netted
city and state police five cars and a late-model truck.
   Acting on a tip, police divers searched the river Thursday and
found the vehicles at the end of a pier near the West End Bridge.
They used a crane to raise them from the river.
   At least 10 more vehicles rest on the bottom of that part of the
river, police said.
   The truck had the name and telephone number of a Pittsburgh
pizzeria on its side. Owner Tim Mohr said the truck was stolen
early Sunday.

<HEAD>Burma Rebel Leader Quoted As Supporting Student Demonstrators</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Burma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Burmese rebel leader was quoted today as
saying his group would provide military support to student
protesters if fighting broke out with the armed forces in Burma.
   Brang Seng said the support would include weapons, training and
sanctuary if needed, according to a report in the English-language
Hong Kong Standard.
   Burma has been wracked by weeks of unrest. Students have led
demonstrations seeking to replace one-party rule with a democratic
government.
   In the Burmese capital of Rangoon today, the ruling party
announced it would end its 26-year monopoly on power and hold
general elections under a multiparty system.
   The newspaper said Brang Seng, a key figure in the National
Democratic Front, had predicted today's action in an interview in
Hong Kong earlier this week.
   ``The fact is that they have to abdicate, to leave, to
relinquish,'' he was quoted as saying. He said the Burma Socialist
Program Party could not stay in power much longer.
   The National Democratic Front is an alliance of 10 rebel groups,
all ethnic minorities, fighting the Burmese government. Brang Seng
told the Standard that the front had adopted a ``wait and see''
attitude as anti-government demonstrations swept the country.
   But he said student leaders had been promised support from the
rebels.
   ``We will provide provisions, we will accept them in areas that
are totally liberated by us, and we will, if the need arises, train
and equip them to be ready for that eventuality (of military
confrontation),'' Brang Seng was quoted as saying.
   The Standard said Brang Seng, who belongs to an organization of
the Kachin minority group, had left the British colony, but it did
not say where he went.

<HEAD>Sale of Satellites to China Seen Harming U.S. Security, Space
Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the Reagan administration wins final
approval of its plan to allow China to launch U.S.-made
communications satellites, national security will be damaged and
the U.S. commercial space industry will be ``cut off at the
knees,'' a Democratic congressman says.
   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., whose district includes the U.S. space
launch center at Cape Canaveral, told reporters that chances to
overturn the decision in the few remaining days of the 100th
Congress are ``very slim.''
   ``We'll give it the old college try, but it will be very
difficult to beat them back,'' Nelson said.
   Friday's announcement represented a victory for the State
Department, which overrode contentions by the Transportation
Department and private industry that the deal will place U.S.
producers of satellite launchers at a competitive disadvantage.
   The plan was denounced by Martin Marietta Corp., which makes
rockets for commercial use.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the transaction
is the first of its kind involving a ``non-Western'' destination.
Another official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
President Reagan made the final decision because of the
inter-agency conflict.
   The transaction is subject to approval by Congress and by a
group of Western allies that monitor high-technology transfers.
   Nelson said he believes national security will be damaged if the
deal goes through because ``when we allow them to integrate one of
the most sophisticated satellites known to planet Earth onto a
Chinese rocket we have just given away a great part of the American
advantage.''
   He said the sale will enable the Chinese to learn technology in
which the United States has the world's leading edge.
   ``We're giving away American jobs and the technology needed to
keep those jobs,'' the congressman asserted. ``The nation is ill
served by this decision because it cuts the fledgling American
rocket industry off at the knees.''
   Redman said a license application was submitted by Hughes
Aircraft Co. for the Chinese launch of two of its satellites which
have been ordered by an Australian consortium, AUSSAT.
   He also announced the conditional approval of a license for the
launch of a third U.S.-made satellite on a Chinese launch vehicle.
Known as AsiaSat, the satellite will be launched on behalf of a
Hong Kong-based consortium with Chinese and British ownership.
   Redman said that in reaching its decision, the administration
was trying to assure the ability of the U.S. commercial launch
industry ``to compete on an equal footing with launches from a
non-market economy, while continuing to promote increased
U.S.-China trade.''

<HEAD>Postal Window Service Restored</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service today is restoring the
window services it cut last February in a move that saved $40
million and helped cushion an expected $500 million deficit this
year for the U.S. mail system.
   Hours at post offices won't necessarily be the same as before
the cuts were imposed, however, with local managers allowed to make
changes that they think best serve their customers.
   Ordered by Congress to cut out $160 million in spending, the
Postal Service made a series of changes, including reducing window
hours at most offices by a half-day per week.
   The reduction in hours drew heavy criticism, coming just two
months before postage rates were increased.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank has struggled to explain that
the two events were not related.
   The rate increase was in response to a rising deficit, and had
been in the works for more than a year. The service cuts were
necessitated when Congress unexpectedly ordered the spending
reduction. It was part of an effort to reduce the overall federal
budget, even though the post office no longer receives a taxpayer
subsidy.
   In restoring the window hours, local managers were given the
option to adjust hours to suit the needs of their communities.
   For example, Saturday hours will not be restored in heavily
Jewish sections of New York City, where little business was done on
that day anyway because of the sabbath. Instead, managers will
experiment with staying open later some days or perhaps having some
Sunday office hours.
   In other areas, instead of extending hours overall, managers
will add more clerks to handle business during peak times.
   While the hours of window clerk service are returning, other
money-saving cuts imposed in February remain in effect, including
curtailment of Sunday mail collection and sorting and a moratorium
on construction of new post offices.
   Congress, meanwhile, is considering bills to remove the Postal
Service from the federal budget as a way to avoid similar service
reductions in the future. The window closings saved about $40
million, officials reported.
   Unless action is taken, the Postal Service faces another $270
million in spending cuts in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
   That will not mean that hours will be cut again, however.
   Postal managers say they have found ways to cut spending _
although at the cost of slower service _ by such things as
switching some mail from airplanes to trucks, changing trucking
schedules, reducing management travel and training spending and
cutting research and development.
   The Postal Service expects to finish the current fiscal year at
the end of this month with a deficit of between $500 million and
$550 million.
   Higher postage rates which took effect April 4 are expected to
help boost the agency into the black in fiscal 1989, however.
   The Postal Service has managed to break even over the last
decade, losing money in some years and showing a surplus in others.

<TEXT>
   The High Court sentenced a
78-year-old scavenger to death by hanging after convicting him of
possessing 6.4 pounds of opium.
   Teng Soi told the court he had just picked up the bag containing
the opium at a dump when he was arrested Nov. 24, 1984. He said he
did not know what was in the bag.
   Justice K.C. Vohrah, in passing the death sentence, said it was
improbable anyone would throw into the garbage that amount of
cocaine.
   Malaysia in 1975 passed laws providing the death penalty for
drug trafficking. Since then, 184 people have been sentenced to
death and 62 have been executed by hanging. The others are awaiting
appeals or execution dates.

<TEXT>
   Small spenders were out in force for the final day
of an auction of Elton John's belongings, purchasing the rock
star's soap dish, chamber pot and even the posters advertising the
sale.
   The sale, which ended Friday, reaped a total of $8.17 million.
   ``A lot of this stuff was cheap, and small private buyers could
afford it,'' said Fiona James, a spokeswoman for Sotheby's auction
house. ``Lots of them were Elton John fans.''
   The sale started Tuesday and consisted of 1,922 lots, including
Rembrandt etchings, an umbrella with a large ``E'' for the handle,
a replica of Egyptian Pharoah Tutankhamun's throne, and the
singer's stilt-like boots from the 1975 film ``Tommy.''
   Sotheby's had expected the sale to bring in $5 million. Ms.
James said the final two days brought in $2.63 million, but she
could not provide a figure for Friday alone.
   Small and unusual items went on the block Friday, Ms. James
said. Among them were a pair of silver Cartier bowls, one of which
John used as a soap dish in his bathroom. They sold for about
$1,030.
   A chamber pot fetched $270. One American fan paid about $930 for
the plastic banners advertising the sale.
   John's cassette-tape player, in a miniature grand piano, sold
for $1,765 while a penny-operated amusement machine fetched $820.
   Top prices went to statuettes by the French artist Erte. One, of
a woman holding a globe, sold for $14,315, almost five times the
expected price.
   John, 41, has said he wants to make room in his mansion near
Windsor, west of London, to start new collections. Sotheby's said
he kept up with the auction proceedings by telephone from Miami.
   The singer's varied art collection sold for $1.3 million
Thursday. His stage costumes, memorabilia, furniture, ornaments and
jewelry were sold Tuesday and Wednesday.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen is fighting for votes in California by blasting the
Republicans on labor issues and trying to show strength where the
Democrats have a weak image: law and order.
   Bentsen today planned to visit Operation Safe Streets, a Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Office program in the Los Angeles suburb
of Carson to combat crime, including gang violence. The Texas
senator has criticized the Reagan administration for cutting money
to help local law enforcement efforts.
   He also planned to attend a rally today in San Diego before
returning to Los Angeles for a dinner honoring California Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown.
   On Friday in Bloomington east of Los Angeles, Bentsen attended a
rally in a union hall to where he took part in the Democratic
campaign to give 60 days notice to the Republicans before election
day.
   Bentsen told the cheering crowd, many waving giant ``pink
slips'' for George Bush, that ``We're here today to give the
Republicans a better break than they give the American worker.''
   ``Sure, we could provide notice the Republican way,'' he said.
``We could go there election eve and we could change the locks on
the door.
   ``We could take the vice president's White House mess card and
cancel that. And we could take away Air Force Two,'' he said. ``But
we agree with the vast majority of the American people who say 60
days notice is fair.''
   Bentsen, digging at Bush as he mined for California's 47
electoral votes, said the vice president has had many
``conversions'' on issues lately.
   ``He's like a successful missionary. He has a conversion every
day,'' Bentsen said. ``But the only problem (is) he's converting
himself. Last week he discovered the environment. This week he
discovered the minimum wage and said well maybe, maybe it should be
raised. And the next day he really wasn't so sure.''
   Earlier Friday, Bentsen told farmers in Amana, Iowa, that Bush
and his running mate, Dan Quayle, don't understand rural needs.
   Asked by reporters about Michael Dukakis' controversial
statement during the primaries suggesting that farmers grow Belgian
endives to help solve their problems, Bentsen said the
Massachusetts governor now has a better understanding. ``I'm sure
he does,'' Bentsen said.

<HEAD>New Effort To Amend Medicaid Abortion Rules Seems Doomed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The first attempt to liberalize Medicaid
abortion restrictions in seven years appears doomed to failure in
the wake of a House vote to continue paying for abortions only when
a woman's life is endangered.
   The House voted 216-166 Friday to stand by existing policy
rather than go along with a Senate plan to permit
government-financed abortions for poor victims of rape and incest.
   The abortion controversy arose in connection with a $140 billion
spending bill for the departments of labor, education and health
and human services that also included funds for AIDS and student
financial aid. House and Senate negotiators came to agreement on
every other element of the massive fiscal 1989 appropriations bill,
but were stymied on abortion.
   The House action added to mounting pressure on the Senate to
back off its amendment. President Reagan has said repeatedly he
would veto the entire spending bill if abortion policy is
liberalized.
   The Senate could act on the bill and the abortion question as
early as Monday, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
indicated Friday.
   ``We are disappointed but not defeated,'' said Kate Michelman,
president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, in a
statement after the House vote. Apparently anticipating a similar
setback in the Senate, she added, ``we shall redouble our efforts
with the new Congress and the new administration and we'll try
again.''
   Under an amendment authored by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., Medicaid
pays only for abortions needed to save the life of a woman. It had
been seven years since either chamber had voted to liberalize the
policy until the Senate adopted the rape and incest provision on
July 27.
   Specifically, the Senate measure said Medicaid would pay for
abortions in cases of promptly reported rape or incest. States
still would have the option of barring payments for all abortions
except those necessary to save a woman's life.
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National
Right-to-Life Committee, issued a statement saying ``the groups
pushing for these changes really want to restore federal funding of
abortion on demand.''
   Much of the House debate centered on the fundamental morality of
abortion, despite the narrow focus of the amendment.
   ``You can't avoid injustice in a rape situation. You can't avoid
injustice in an incest situation. But why compound the injustice by
putting on top of it exterminating an innocent human life?'' Hyde
said. ``Don't make us a part of that double tragedy. ... Out of
great, great tragedy, some good can come.''
   Lawmakers on the other side argued with equal passion that poor
women victimized by brutal crimes are entitled to a full range of
medical options.
   ``The consequences to individuals are very substantial,'' said
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md. ``This is the appropriate and sensitive and
humane step for us to take.''
   Faye Wattleton, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America, accused the House of treating poor women callously.
``To force a woman to bear her rapist's child because she is poor
is the cruelest insult imaginable,'' Wattleton said in a statement.
   However, some Hyde allies noted that medical procedures are
available to prevent conception after rapes or incest. Others said
the proposed exceptions would create problems for law enforcement
officers confronted with reports of rape.
   ``What we're going to do is make liars out of women so that they
can get an abortion funded by the government,'' contended Rep.
Harold Volkmer, D-Mo.
   Before moving to the abortion debate, the House voted 335-60 to
approve the other portions of the three-agency spending bill. The
measure includes $1.2 billion for AIDS research, treatment,
prevention and education; $4.3 billion in education grants for
disadvantaged students; $5.5 billion in college student financial
assistance, and $3.7 billion for the Job Training Partnership Act.

   Randall Adams has spent 12 years fighting to prove
he didn't kill the policeman for whose murder he nearly was
executed. The key witness now supports him, and a new movie based
on Adams' case has prompted petition drives demanding his freedom.
   ``The Thin Blue Line,'' directed by Errol Morris, strongly
suggests the wrong man was tried and petitions are circulating in
theaters calling for a pardon.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said he is
unimpressed by the film, which is now playing in more than 200
cities, and sees no reason to reopen the case.
   ``Nothing in there convinces me we have the wrong man in jail,''
Vance said this week.
   However, evidence Morris gathered in nearly three years of
investigation, including prosecution witnesses who told him on
camera that they lied in Adams' 1977 trial, is being used by
attorneys to prepare a motion for a new trial.
   ``The Thin Blue Line'' uses both real interviews with most of
the key people in the case and re-enactments of the shooting from
the perspectives of different characters.
   ``I'm not a reporter,'' Morris said, adding he prefers to call
the movie a ``non-fiction feature.''
   On Nov. 28, 1976, Adams, then 27, ran out of gas driving home
from work. David Harris, a teen-ager who'd stolen a car and driven
to Dallas, helped Adams get gas and the pair spent the rest of the
day drinking and smoking marijuana.
   That night, Dallas policeman Robert Wood was shot and killed
after he and a partner stopped a car being driven with only its
parking lights on.
   A month later, when police arrested Harris for an unrelated
crime in his hometown of Vidor, in southeast Texas, they learned he
had bragged to friends about killing a Dallas police officer.
   But when questioned by Dallas police, Harris accused Adams, who
had no criminal record. With Harris the star prosecution witness,
Adams was convicted of Wood's slaying in 1977 and sentenced to die
in the electric chair.
   Adams received a stay three days before his May 1979 execution
date. In 1980, his death sentence was commuted to life in prison
after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that his trial jury had been
improperly selected.
   The film ends with Harris, now on death row himself for another
murder, saying Adams did not kill Wood. In recent weeks, Harris
made similar statements to Dallas news organizations.
   After Harris' statements appeared in Dallas newspapers, Adams
said, ``Maybe now people will start to listen a little closer to
what I've been saying for 12 years.'' Adams has not seen the movie.
   ``The ball is now in Vance's court,'' said Houston attorney
Randy Schaffer, Adams lawyer. He said he expects to hear within two
weeks whether the prosecutor will contest a motion on Adams' behalf
or seek a pardon from the governor.
   The motion ``basically has to do with suppression of favorable
evidence, perjury by witnesses, favorable documents and reports
that were supposed to be turned over to defense that were not,''
said Schaffer. ``And we have evidence with regard to (Adams')
innocence.''
   Vance said, ``It's not unusual for a man on death row to say the
things Harris is saying.'' He won't say how he'll respond to the
motion.
   Gov. Bill Clements was out of town Friday, but his aide, Knox
Fitzpatrick, said the office has gotten a number of letters about
the case. He would not say what the governor's opinion was of the
case.
   Petitions seeking a pardon initially were distributed by
Miramax, the film's distribution company, said Miramax spokeswoman
Christina Kounelias. Now the petitions are being handled by an
Albany-based group called Solace, a support group for murder
victim's families and a subsidiary of Amnesty International.
   There was no immediate tally on how many signatures had been
collected.
   Solace is also spearheading two fund-raisers for Adams, one in
Chicago next week and another in Boston the following week.
   Morris met Adams while interviewing inmates for another project.
   Intrigued, he arranged to meet Harris, before Harris was
arrested and convicted.
   ``That first night David Harris told me that he would never
forget the look in that cop's eyes, which was completely to the
contrary to what he'd said at the trial, where he said he'd been in
the passenger's seat slumped way down,'' Morris said.
   Morris said former District Attorney Henry Wade ``provided me
with evidence that Randall Adams did not receive a fair trial in
1977, that it was an illegal trial.''

   Here is the 216-166 roll call Friday by which
the House refused to go along with a Senate amendment expanding
Medicaid abortions to rape and incest victims.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to keep existing law, which limits
Medicaid payments to abortions needed to save a woman's life. A
``no'' vote was to change the law.
   Voting yes were 90 Democrats and 126 Republicans.
   Voting no were 136 Democrats and 30 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.
   There are three vacancies in the 435-member House.

   A man convicted of murdering his 20-year-old
daughter asked a judge to confirm his death sentence as soon as
possible so he can watch television in his cell, a prison spokesman
says.
   ``Please bring me in and sentence me,'' Gary Starr, 47, of Moon
Township said in a letter filed with Allegheny County Judge Jeffrey
Manning's office Friday. ``I thought the jury already sentenced me
to death.''
   Starr requested the quick action because it will put him in a
section of the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh where
televisions are permitted, according to prison spokesman Thomas
Seiverling.
   A jury Aug. 23 sentenced Starr to die for the Feb. 19 stabbing
death of daughter Wanda Starr, also of Moon Township. The murder
occurred after Starr, a former apartment complex manager,
confronted his daughter about stolen rent money.
   During his trial, Starr admitted having a 6-year incestuous
relationship with the woman. Sixteen years ago, he was convicted of
shooting his wife Linda to death as she slept. He served 8{ years
in prison for that crime.
   Starr is housed in an area of the prison where televisions are
prohibited, Seiverling said.
   After Starr is sentenced by Manning, he will be housed in a
restricted area of the prison reserved for inmates facing
execution. Prisoners there are locked in their cells for all but 20
minutes each day, but are allowed to watch television.
   The state Supreme Court automatically will review Starr's death
sentence.

   Seoul gourmets continue to enjoy dog
stew and Korean Olympic stars have been consuming barrels of snake
soup despite government attempts to ban the traditional delicacies
during the Summer Games.
   The government has outlawed sales in Seoul of dog meat, snake,
blood worm soup and other exotic dishes to avoid offending
foreigners during the Olympics, which begin Sept. 17. Officials
said visitors might be disgusted by the unusual culinary offerings
and Koreans would be called barbaric.
   But the ban has had little or no effect on Seoul restaurants or
the eating habits of their customers. Dog meat is still a lunchtime
favorite in many backstreet eateries.
   ``Even the government officials eat it. They just tell us not to
let foreigners see,'' said one restaurant owner who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The number of customers for dog has not dwindled. Not at
all,'' he said with a big smile.
   Korean athletes training for the Olympics have been eating dog,
snakes and deer antlers to help build up their strength and
stamina. Boxers, wrestlers and others believe eating dog and snake
will give them the endurance and strength of the animals.
   Seoul newspapers reported the Korea Amateur Hockey Association
provided the country's womens' Olympic team with $28,000 worth of
snake soup. Association officials declined to comment.
   Star player Kim Kye-sook was quoted by The Korea Herald as
saying, ``I was so surprised when the association officials brought
the snake soup to us. But after taking the soup, I felt much
stronger.''
   Olympic soccer star Choi Soon-ho was quoted as saying he ate 500
snakes as part of his summer training.
   The Korean Amateur Wrestling Federation provided funds to the
Olympic wrestling team to buy snake soup and ``kaesoju,'' a mixture
of dog meat and herbs that builds strength, newspapers reported.
   Officials say a ban was imposed on dog meat in Seoul about five
years ago because the government feared dog restaurants would
offend Westerners and create an image of Koreans eating lovable
pets.
   Sales continued, and restaurant owners say city officials
recently repeated warnings not to serve dog during the Olympics.
But they said officials told them restrictions would be eased after
the Games.
   A senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
ban backfired by focusing attention on the dog meat issue. He said
it also stirred protests from many Koreans about ridiculing
national tradition.
   ``The French eat snails and horses and everyone says they are
great eaters. Why shouldn't we eat dogmeat?'' he said.
   Koreans say dogs used for eating are specially raised just like
cattle. They bridle at suggestions that pets are eaten and say they
love and care for dogs as much as anyone.
   A restaurant owner, who takes pride in his own special recipe
for dog stew, said the food was a traditional part of Korean
cooking and a part of the nation's culture. The meat is seasoned
with garlic and other spices and usually served as stew.
   ``How can our indigenous habits be cast away in a day,'' the man
said. ``I'm sure this will not perish forever by any means.''
   Seoul municipal officials conceded the ban was very difficult to
impose and it has had little impact. Dog meat restaurants are still
legal in the rest of the country.
   Restaurant owners caught selling dog meat three times in a year
have their licenses confiscated, officials said. No statistics were
available on the number of cases prosecuted by the city.
   ``You tell us where they are selling dog food and we will send
an inspector,'' said a Health Department official.
   Some foreigners, far from being appalled by dog meat, have tried
the dish and found it agreeable.
   ``It's good. Much better than roast pork,'' said one visiting
journalist.

   Lauro F. Cavazos says it's time Americans
``start caring'' about the educational needs of all citizens, and
he is promising to put the focus on the issue if confirmed as the
next education secretary.
   ``I know this won't be turned around in a decade. We can't wait
any longer. We've waited too long,'' Cavazos told the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee as it considered his nomination
Friday to replace outgoing Education Secretary William J. Bennett.
   If sworn in, Cavazos would become the first Hispanic member of a
president's Cabinet.
   Cavazos, 61, appeared headed for an easy confirmation, with
senators praising the son of a cattle foreman on the King Ranch in
Texas who went on to become president of Texas Tech University. He
became the first Hispanic and the first graduate of the school to
hold the post with his selection in 1980.
   ``He is eminently qualified for this appointment with
considerable experience in higher education,'' said Sen. Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I. ``And in view of the fact that he has 10 children
between the ages of 21 and 31, he has also had a central investment
in elementary and secondary education.''
   Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he was
impressed and reassured by Cavazos' testimony that he would fight
for increased spending and for making the Education Department a
vigorous advocate of education for all.
   ``Your responses have been enormously helpful and I look forward
to supporting you now,'' Kennedy said. ``I'm going to do everything
we can to assure an early confirmation.''
   Kennedy said a vote by the committee may be taken Tuesday.
   ``It seems like you're the type of person who can come in here
and heal any wounds that might exist, and build that consensus,''
said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   President Reagan last month nominated Cavazos to replace the
often-confrontational Bennett.
   Cavazos, during questioning by Kennedy, said he disagreed with
some of Bennett's positions, including the secretary's claim that
bilingual education had been a failure.
   Bennett declared in 1985 there was no evidence that the
Bilingual Education Act had helped children, but Cavazos said: ``I
believe there has been a tremendous amount of success across a long
period of time.''
   Cavazos praised Bennett and the administration's leadership in
education, however, saying that in the past seven years ``we have
arrested the decline in American education, but ... we still have
much to accomplish.''
   ``We must do everything in our power to help each student reach
his or her potential,'' Cavazos said. ``To remain a great nation,
we must ensure that no human resource is left untapped. ... We must
keep our young people in school, make our citizens literate,
provide opportunity to our minority students, and foster
independence for handicapped students. America needs the full
participation of every individual and the only way to ensure this
is through quality education.''
   Cavazos has a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's degree
in cytology _ the study of cells _ from Texas Tech and a 1954
doctorate in physiology from Iowa State University.

<HEAD>Koch Seeks Compromise on Sludge-Dumping Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch has
characterized as ``savage'' and ``less savage'' a pair of bills
that would call for an end to sludge dumping in the ocean by 1993,
but he urged the two be rolled into one to make the city's fight
easier.
   ``We hope that when the bill comes to the floor it will be one
bill, the two (committee) chairs will compromise out their
differences and that we don't have to fight on every level, front
and back and on all sides,'' Koch said Friday. ``We would like to
be able to deal with one bill.''
   The mayor met with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Rep.
Claude Pepper, D-Fla. Pepper is chairman of the House Rules
Committee, which could order that the two bills be combined.
   Wright and Pepper indicated ``they will consider the request on
merits,'' Koch said.
   The two bills _ one sponsored by Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J.,
the other by Rep. Henry Nowak, D-N.Y. _ both mandate that New York
City and eight other sewage authorities stop dumping sludge in the
Atlantic Ocean by Dec. 31, 1992.
   New York City, which produces 3.8 million wet tons of sludge a
year, has said it cannot meet that deadline and needs until at
least 1998 to find disposal alternatives.
   The other authorities that are dumping sludge 106 miles offshore
are: Nassau and Westchester counties in New York; and in New
Jersey, Middlesex County; Passaic Valley; Joint Meeting of Essex
and Union Counties; Bergen County; Rahway Valley; and
Linden-Roselle.
   Those authorities that fail to meet the deadline would be fined
on a scale that could subject New York City to paying somewhere
between $146 million and $730 million a year, according to Judy
Chesser, the city's Washington representative.
   The city does not like either bill; Koch called the Hughes
version ``savage'' and the Nowak bill ``less savage.'' The key
difference between the two is the Nowak bill would allow the city
to enter a consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency
which could stipulate that the dumping end by a date later than
1992, although the fines would still go into effect, Chesser said.
   ``We would be negotiating a consent decree on a schedule we felt
we could meet,'' she said of the Nowak bill. ``EPA, of course,
would be pushing us to have the most expedited schedule possible.''
   The EPA has stopped negotiating with New York over the city's
compromise offer to stop dumping by 1998, said Herman Phillips, a
regional EPA spokesman in Manhattan.
   ``We're not negotiating any deadline yet because we're waiting
to see what Congress is going to do,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Senate last month passed a similar bill to stop
the dumping of sewage sludge by January 1992. Under that bill, New
York City could end up paying up to $152 million in fines,
according to Chesser.
   City officials arehoping a later deadline will be worked out
when the House and Senate bills move to conference for
reconciliation.

   The Reagan administration is disappointed that
negotiations on military bases in the Philippines have broken down,
but Secretary of State George P. Shultz says U.S. officials will be
patient.
   He said the demands Manila had made on Washington were ``out of
bounds.''
   ``We will be patient, and we will be persistent,'' Shultz said
Friday. ``But we'll also stick to our basic ideas.''
   Shultz will meet in Washington next week with Philippine Foreign
Minister Raul Manglapus and again in New York at the end of the
month when they attend the special session of the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Shultz said ``we seemed to have things on a pretty good track''
when he saw Manglapus on a trip to Manila last July. ``But,
subsequently, it didn't work out that way,'' he said.
   ``I am a little disappointed right now,'' he told the board of
directors of the General Federation of Women's Clubs.
   Shultz spoke to the group about various foreign policy issues.
He was asked about the Philippines when he opened the discussion to
questions.
   The United States is paying the Philippines $180 million a year
for use of the Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base.
   Shultz and other State Department officials have not said what
the United States has offered to extend the agreement past 1991 and
what the Philippines demanded.
   Manglapus, in a news conference Friday in Manila, said the
United States had offered $502 million for use of the bases and
four smaller installations.
   Congressional sources told The Associated Press on Wednesday the
United States had offered to double the yearly payment to $360
million as part of a $489 aid package.
   According to the sources, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, the Philippines requested more than $1 billion a year in
overall aid.
   Asked if he would insist on the same figure when he meets with
U.S. officials, Manglapus replied, ``Oh, yes. We shall be
clarifying that our position is reasonable.''
   ``We frankly think that what the Philippines seems to be asking
is out of bounds,`` Shultz said, without referring to any specific
figure. ``We are saying that to them and trying to convince them.''
   He said the two bases were ``very useful to us'' and ``we
believe they are very useful for the security of the Philippines.''

<TEXT>
   The Serbian Communist Party chief's
public defiance of the national leadership has thrown this Balkan
country of competing ethnic groups into its most explosive
political crisis of the postwar era.
   Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday rejected a call from the federal
Communist Party Presidium to put an end to nationalist rallies in
the southern province of Kosovo, where minority Slavs contend they
are harrassed by ethnic Albanians who form 90 percent of the
province's population.
   On Tuesday, more than 100,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, who are
Slavs, staged protest rallies. Demonstrators shouted, ``Give us
arms'' and ``Army to Kosovo,'' underscoring the Serbian
leadership's demand to send the army to Kosovo to restore order.
   Kosovo is an autonomous region within the republic of Serbia.
Milosevic and other Serbian leaders want to change the federal
constitution so the republic can assert control over Kosovo and the
autonomous province of Vojvodina.
   Under the 1974 constitution, Serbia cannot interfere in Kosovo's
judiciary, police or other institutions.
   Leaders of other republics oppose the idea. Newspaper editorials
have said that the foundation of the Yugoslav state is threatened.
   Commenting on the showdown, the daily Vjesnik of Zagreb, capital
of Croatia, warned that an increasing number of Yugoslavs were
questioning the 1943 agreement that gave birth to communist
Yugoslavia. The nation is made up of six republics, each of which
has its own constitution, assembly and president.
   ``We witness a sharpening of nationalism and chauvinism on the
entire Yugoslav territory,'' the editorial said.
   Milosevic's supporters planned weekend rallies in the city of
Jajce, where the agreement was worked out, but local officials
rejected the plan. The organizers then said they would hold a
``solidarity meeting'' there Sept. 17.
   Milosevic has lashed out at the national leadership by saying
the Serbs and Montenegrins have ``shown patience for the
inefficiency of this country and the incompetence of its
representatives.''
   In Tuesday's speech, he asserted Yugoslav leaders failed to
bring peace to Kosovo. Referring to Slavs living there, he said,
``This summer their patience came to an end.''
   Milosevic defended the fast-spreading Serbian discontent as
justified expression of popular sentiment, while opponents say it
will result in anarchy.
   Within hours, the Yugoslav Communist Party's Central Committee
scheduled a session for late September to take action on Kosovo and
Milosevic, who enjoys popular support in Serbia and the Belgrade
press.
   On Friday, the Tanjug news agency said a police unit from
another part of Serbia would leave for Kosovo to reinforce local
police.
   On Thursday, more than 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins assembled
at the Kosovo town of Vucitrn to protest what they called
``aggressive assaults of Albanian chauvinists and separatists,''
the Belgrade daily Politika reported.
   The rally followed an attack last week on the home of a Serbian
woman. Two ethnic Albanians, convicted of damaging the house, were
sentenced to 30 days in jail. The ethnic Albanian judge involved
was dismissed and the terms were increased to 60 days.
   Demonstrators were heard singing a folk song that boldly
compares Milosevic to the late President Josip Broz Tito, the
virtually uncontested leader of non-aligned Yugoslavia for three
decades.
   Most Belgrade newspapers give a lopsided view of what is going
on in Kosovo, scene of bloody rioting for greater autonomy in 1981.
   They keep reiterating that more than 30,000 Serbs and
Montenegrins left the province in recent years because of arson and
other attacks blamed on Albanians.
   Ethnic Albanians are rarely given a chance to respond in public
to what appear to be grossly distorted accounts.
   In the regime-controlled press, the Slav exodus is entirely
blamed on the Albanians, an estimated 500 of whom are in jail.
   The Tanjug news agency reported Friday that authorities in
Duesseldorf, West Germany, warned Albanian families from towns in
Macedonia they would be turned down as political refugees because
``their true motives ... are purely economic.''
   Conversely, Serbian media have had practically no reports that
Slavs have relocated for economic reasons from Kosovo, Yugoslavia's
most underdeveloped region.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-ton stash of marijuana was discovered aboard
a Honduran-registered freighter stopped in British waters last
week, a customs official said.
   ``There's tons of it coming out,'' Peter Biles of the Customs
and Excise Department said Friday of the discovery on the ship,
identified as the Salton Sea. ``It's ... a big pro job.''
   Biles said the ship's Dutch captain, three Dutch crewmen and
four Colombian crewmen were charged with illegally importing
cannabis into Britain and were being held in police custody.
   The Honduran-registered ship was captured Sept. 3 after a chase
across the English Channel from the northeast coast of France,
where it had failed to stop for a routine check by French customs
officers.
   The French fired two warning shots but the freighter churned off
to British waters and finally surrendered to the British coast
guard. It was escorted into Ramsgate on the southeast coast of
England.

   It's time for a clean sweep in this
east-central Illinois town _ and in most places, say promoters of
the annual Broomcorn Festival in the self-proclaimed Broomcorn
Capital of the World.
   Broomcorn?
   The stuff that brooms are made of _ actually a form of sorghum.
   And it doesn't last forever.
   ``People always say, `I've got to buy a new broom,' but they
don't,'' said Alvin Winger, whose Warren Broom Co. _ one of seven
broom makers around this town of 2,700 _ has been in business since
1900.
   ``You can't do much with an old broom except sweep rocks off the
driveway,'' he said.
   So the highlight of this year's festival is a broom-burning _
come one, come all. Those who chuck a broom into a bonfire today
receive a discount on a new one.
   The fiery event has a message: A new broom sweeps clean.
   ``Take a look at a new broom. The straws are split into little
feathery ends. That's what picks up the dust and dirt,'' said
William Libman, whose family owns Libman Broom Co., the biggest of
the area producers.
   Brooms provide 250 jobs in the broomcorn capital, although much
of the broomcorn _ which must be hand-harvested _ is imported from
Mexico.
   Arcola goes all out to celebrate its industry. In addition to
the bonfire, the three-day festival ending Sunday features a
parade, a miniature corn palace, broom-making demonstrations, folk
crafts and country cooking. It has drawn as many as 50,000 visitors
in past years, said spokesman Daniel J. Hines.

   A bull that wandered from its new
owners' farm sauntered through a city neighborhood before stopping
to munch apples from one of Fred Schense's trees.
   Schense was repairing a thermometer outside his home Thursday
when he encountered the stray animal. ``I glanced up and then it
dawned on me, `Hey, that's not a common critter, there's a bull
coming through the yard,''' he recalled.
   The bull knocked down part of a fence belonging to the animal's
owners, the Sidney Wright family, and walked about a mile before
stopping to partake of Schense's apples, said animal control
officer Reginald Grant.
   Grant and fellow officer Joanne Waite roped the bull and tied it
to the apple tree. The Wrights took it back to pasture in a trailer.
   ``Luckily, the critter was quite tame,'' Schense said. ``He was
pretty peaceful through the whole thing. You could walk up to it. I
even mooed at him a couple times, you know.''

   Only in Beverly Hills could a
$200,000, chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce be considered an eyesore.
   But that's the problem facing David Spellerberg, who says he has
gotten nothing but complaints _ and threat of prosecution _ for
parking his 1954 black Rolls in front of his art gallery on Rodeo
Drive.
   He says his neighbors aren't just mad about the car, but the
people it attracts: namely thousands of tourists in the last six
months who have posed in front of the sleek black beauty while
their pictures were being taken.
   ``Anyplace else in the world and people would be happy to have a
Rolls-Royce parked in front of their business,'' said Spellerberg.
``But not Beverly Hills.''
   Spellerberg readily admits he leaves the car in the one-hour
metered space as a tourist attraction at the National Heritage
Gallery, which sells seascapes and other traditional-style
paintings and sculptures.
   His chauffeur stands by, reading a book and feeding the meter
with $15 in quarters each day.
   ``After all, wasn't it the public and tourists that made Rodeo
Drive and Beverly Hills famous?'' he asks in a full-page ad taken
out Friday in a local paper. ``This magnificent vintage Rolls-Royce
has allowed thousands to capture a touch of the `glitter and
glamour' that Beverly Hills is famous for.''
   But the city doesn't see it that way. In fact, the city attorney
wrote to Spellerberg's attorney saying that the matter has been
passed to the ``litigation-prosecution department.''
   There was no answer at city hall offices Friday, which was a
state holiday. But in general, parking meter regulations in the
region do not allow motorists to keep their cars indefinitely in
one spot, even if they return periodically to feed the meter.
   Spellerberg, however, says he won't give up. His advertisement
in the Beverly Hills Courier urges people to phone City Hall and
speak up in support of the Rolls.
   ``This is just one of those crazy things your hear about,'' he
said. ``I didn't think it would happen to me.''

<HEAD>Congressman Says Vietnam Leaning Toward Excavations for MIA
Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese officials are willing to allow the
excavation of 100 sites to search for the remains of U.S.
servicemen missing since the Vietnam War, says a member of a
congressional delegation who was in Hanoi earlier this month.
   U.S. military officials had been scheduled to begin a round of
meetings on the MIA search Friday in Hanoi, but the talks were
called off after a Vietnamese jetliner crashed minutes before
landing in Bangkok, Thailand, said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla, a Pentagon
spokesman.
   The U.S. military team was to have taken the Friday afternoon
return flight to Hanoi for the technical talks, said Ross Petzing,
spokesman for the embassy in Bangkok.
   Kudla said the talks could begin as early as next week.
   Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, said Vietnam's foreign minister
assured members of a congressional delegation last week in Hanoi
that ``he would let us go in and excavate'' and will propose during
the scheduled talks that 100 sites be targeted for the search.
   ``He doesn't think there's any live MIAs in Vietnam,''
Bustamante said. ``Whether there are some in Laos or Cambodia, he
doesn't know.''
   There are 2,398 U.S. personnel still unaccounted for in the war,
Bustamante said.
   With the excavations, Bustamante said, ``I feel once and for
all, we can clear in the minds of some of our families what
happened to their loved ones.''
   Bustamante said the foreign minister also told the congressional
delegation that all of the Amerasian children in Vietnam, estimated
between 10,000 and 12,000, would be allowed to leave.

   Miss Utah played a classical piano
piece and Miss Florida wore a ``supersuit'' to victory in
preliminary competitions for the Miss America Pageant on Friday
night.
   Miss Utah Sophia Christine Symko, 21, of Salt Lake City, played
an energetic version of ``Spanish Rhapsody.'' She has studied piano
for 17 years.
   ``There were always times when I wanted to quit playing and my
parents encouraged me to continue,'' she said in an earlier
interview. ``Now I'm so glad I did. I use my piano playing as a
part-time job to earn money for my schooling. I wouldn't trade that
for anything.''
   For her performance Miss Symko wore a classical Spanish dress of
black satin trimmed in large red satin ruffles that hung off the
shoulders and with a ruffled red petticoat. She wore a matching red
flowered headpiece.
   Miss Symko, born in Oxford, England, is a graduate student at
the University of Utah pursuing her masters in physics. She plans
to attend medical school.
   Miss Florida Melissa Aggeles, a 5-foot-8, 128-pound brunette who
has said she was ``quite the tomboy when I was young,'' wore a
white competition supersuit, the famous custom-designed swimsuit
said to hide flaws and enhance assets.
   She was the second contestant to wear a white supersuit to
victory this year.
   The 24-year-old from St. Petersburg, Fla., graduated in 1987
from Florida State University. She hopes to eventually receive a
masters degree in fine arts from New York University, specializing
in classics and film. Ultimately, Miss Aggeles said she aspires to
a career on Broadway and in film.
   In the meantime, as Miss Florida she hopes to implement a
program to reduce high school dropouts called ``School is Cool.''
   This year, 27 of the 51 contestants wore ``supersuits.'' Sixteen
were white, the color worn to victory by several recent Miss
Americas.
   Friday's competition was the last of three nights of swimsuit,
talent and evening gown rounds. The winners of the preliminary
evening gown competitions are kept secret to heighten the suspense
for the finals.
   The preliminary competitions for the contestants are the first
steps to the live nationally televised Miss America Pageant on
Saturday.
   The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary
competitions and interviews with the judges will compete to succeed
Miss America 1988 Kaye Lani Rae Rafko.
   In the preliminaries, talent counts for 50 percent, while the
other 50 percent is divided among the swimsuit, evening gown and
interview divisions.
   After the first three nights, the total scores will determine
the finalists, and those 10 then start again with a clean slate on
Saturday night.
   At Wednesday night's preliminary competition, Miss Louisiana
Valerie Brosset wore a white supersuit to win the swimsuit
competition, and Miss Oklahoma Lori Lee Kelley sang an aria from
``The Barber of Seville.''
   On Thursday night, the preliminary swimsuit competition was won
by Miss Mississippi Carla Haag with a simple white swimsuit. Miss
Minnesota Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson won the talent competition
with a violin solo titled ``Gypsy Airs.''
   The preliminary awards carry scholarships: $3,500 in the talent
division and $2,500 in the swimsuit competition.

<HEAD>Andrei Sakharov Says Party and Gorbachev Back Away From Some
Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel laureate and leading
Soviet dissenter, says he sees signs that the Communist Party
hierarchy and Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself are retreating from some
areas of Gorbachev's reform program.
   Asked Friday if Yegor K. Ligachev, a member of the ruling
Politburo, was behind the opposition to perestroika, or
restructuring, Sakharov said Ligachev's speeches show he is ``a
reactionary, dangerous force, but by far not the only one.''
   Regarding Gorbachev, Sakharov said he believed the Kremlin
chief's speeches have ``become more radical and show a deeper
understanding of the situation,'' but he saw elements of
backtracking.
   The 67-year-old nuclear physicist, winner of the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize, said foes of perestroika are behind the continued
defense here of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968
that crushed a liberal communist government.
   He said the reforms in Czechoslovakia that led to the invasion
are similar to programs now being pushed in the Soviet republic of
Estonia.
   Sakharov spoke with reporters after he was presented with a
certificate by U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock making him an honorary
member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.
   The scientist, a key figure in developing the Soviet hydrogen
bomb, later helped found the Soviet human rights movement. He was
exiled to Gorky in 1980 for criticizing the Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan and was only allowed to return to
Moscow in December 1986.
   Sakharov called perestroika a ``historical inevitability,'' but
added, ``In May, perestroika reached a very different period which
could be called a reversal.''
   He did not specify what happened in May, but remarked that the
change ``showed at the 19th (Communist) Party conference (in June)
in anti-perestroika forces.''
   Sakharov said ``anti-glasnost forces clearly had the advantage''
at the conference of 5,000 delegates held in Moscow June 28-July 1.
   Glasnost is Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness on
selected subjects.
   Some delegates at the party conference accused the official
media of slandering people and of minimizing Soviet achievements.
   In August, the government announced limits on the number of
subscriptions the public would be allowed for certain publications,
most of which are involved in Gorbachev's drive to re-evaluate
history in a more truthful manner and report current problems.
   Because of the subscription limits ``glasnost will be limited to
a small circle of people and this will harm the whole process,''
Sakharov said.
   Soviet officials have said the restrictions were needed because
there isn't enough paper for the newspapers and magazines to
satisfy demand. Sakharov said the reason is that anti-perestroika
forces want to silence the publications.
   In presenting the award to Sakharov on Friday, Matlock quoted
the American academy as saying: ``His absolute courage and absolute
honesty make him a friend of all those who share a belief in
reason, in freedom of inquiry and in democracy, for the sake of
which he risked both his health and his life.'' The academy is a
New York-based society of artists, writers and musicians.

Monday</HEAD>

   Police fired rubber bullets and
water cannons to break up an anti-government rally of 20,000 during
a nationwide general strike. Labor leaders called for another work
stoppage Monday.
   The clashes with police, vandalism, burning of cars and looting
of stores resulted in dozens of injuries and arrests during the
walkout Friday protesting spiraling inflation and unemployment.
   The unrest made the General Labor Conferation's 12th general
strike against the nearly 5-year-old government of President Raul
Alfonsin the most disorderly and bloody. Labor leaders and police
blamed each other for the violence.
   ``It's a lie that the incidents began among participants of the
rally,'' said Saul Ubaldini, general-secretary of the labor
confederation.
   Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia and Federal Police Chief Juan
Pirker said agitators in the crowd started fights, as did members
of rival unions. When police attempted to restore order, they were
attacked, the said.
   ``Under these circumstances, police intervened to prevent
further damage,'' Nosiglia said. The police action was ``necessary,
prudent and correct,'' Pirker said.
   Nosiglia in a brief communique urged the federation to call off
the Monday walkout.
   ``Nothing justifies a new paralysis of the country, which keeps
delaying progress without any benefit to rights and liberties,'' he
said.
   No deaths were reported in the unrest Friday, but several people
had not regained consciousness hours after they were hospitalized.
   About 50 people were treated at Argerich Hospital for tear gas
inhalation, contusions from rocks and sticks, and abrasions from
falling to the ground when struck by compressed water fired by riot
police. Several dozen others went to at least two other hospitals.
   Two policemen were rushed to Churruca Hospital with severe
injuries, and about 20 others were treated for minor injuries.
   Pirker said he did not know the total number of people arrested.
   Inflation has soared 255 percent this year, and 440 percent for
the past 12 months. Unemployment and underemployment at a combined
14 percent are near 14-year highs. Real personal incomes have
declined for three straight years.
   ``Every day there's less work and my family can't live on what I
earn,'' said Daniel Rio, a middle-aged truck driver who attended
the rally. ``That's why I'm here.''
   President Alfonsin five weeks ago implemented his third major
anti-inflation plan since he took office in December 1983. The
austral was devalued, restrictions on some imports were lifted and
voluntary controls placed on wages and prices.
   The goal, in addition to reducing inflation, was to secure new
loans from the International Monetary Fund and commercial banks to
help repay interest _ $4.6 billion this year _ on Argentina's $56
billion foreign debt.
   Unions and the opposition Peronist Party raise the sensitive
issue of national sovereignty in response to Alfonsin's shaping of
national policy to meet demands by foreign banks.
   The 3.5-million member federation has complained bitterly that
prices have risen despite the controls and pressed for higher wages.
   Friday's strike was effective across this South American country
of 30 million. In the capital, Buenos Aires, striking signalmen
shut down commuter trains before dawn, stranding thousands of
people at home and causing huge backups on roads leading downtown.
   After 8 p.m., the hour the strike was scheduled to end, public
transportation resumed and the capital city of 3 million was calm.
   Late Friday, several public transport unions said they would
participate in Monday's strike, indicating that buses and subways
will be out of service as well as commuter trains.

   Sylvester Stallone, who played a Vietnam
veteran hero in his ``Rambo'' movies, got the government's ear when
he complained that dying grass at Los Angeles National Cemetery was
a disgrace to the war dead buried there.
   The federal government found money to pay the water bill for
sprinkling at the cemetery, where 77,000 veterans are buried,
following Stallone's complaint, cemetery director Patricia Hagler
said Friday.
   Stallone offered to pay for the sprinkling himself after he
learned the Veterans Administration didn't have the money to pay
the $9,250-a-month water bill and that watering had been halted
until new funds become available Oct. 1, said his publicist, Warren
Cowan.
   ``When I think about the amount of water that runs down the
driveways of Beverly Hills, the hypocrisy of it all becomes too
much,'' Cowan quoted Stallone as saying.
   ``His interest alone in the situation precipitated the cemetery
receiving additional funding from Washington, D.C. The grounds are
now being watered'' Ms. Hagler said.
   Stallone's ``spirit of patriotism is evidence that he shares
this nation's pride for its veterans,'' she added.

   Jessica Hahn is sorry more people haven't been
exposed to her true self _ one that ``gets lonely'' and ``cares for
people'' _ even though she has been well exposed in a man's
magazine.
   ``People only see the obvious. They see the Jessica Hahn who was
in Playboy, who made money doing that,'' Hahn said.
   ``The media's picture is the side everyone sees. But there is a
side no one sees,'' said the former church secretary-turned-model.
``It is where my heart really is. It is the side that gets lonely.
It is a side that cares for people.''
   Hahn, 29, says she doesn't have a boyfriend or a manager and
that her family isn't really pleased with her.
   Hahn on Friday reached the halfway point of a 30-day tryout as a
radio personality on KOY-FM, Phoenix. The reviews have been mostly
negative.

   A movie based on the Big Dan's
gang-rape case starring Jodie Foster is being opposed by a
Portuguese-American group, which wants to block its release in the
area where the attack occurred.
   The Portuguese-American Business Association sent letters Friday
asking city officials, state legislators and the area's
congressional delegation to ask theater owners to refrain from
showing ``The Accused,'' which is set to open next month.
   ``The people of our region need not suffer the injustice of
implied guilt ... as a result of Hollywood's sensationalism,''
wrote association president John Miranda.
   In ``The Accused,'' Foster plays the victim of a gang rape,
based on an incident in March 1983 in a tavern in nearby New
Bedford in which a 21-year-old woman was raped on a pool table. The
case received national attention.
   All six defendants were of Portugese descent. Their supporters
said they were victims of lingering racial prejudice against
Portuguese.
   The association fears the film will stir old wounds now healed
after four men were convicted of the rape. Two others were
acquitted. The victim moved to Florida, where she died in a traffic
accident.

   A music, fireworks and laser-beam extravaganza on
the River Thames, scheduled for later this month by French composer
Jean-Michel Jarre, may fizzle out because of fears of fire and
traffic jams.
   The Newham Borough Council, which runs the Royal Victoria Docks
in east London where the two-hour concert is scheduled Sept. 24,
delayed until Monday a decision on whether to permit the show.
   ``People are thinking it is a heavy-metal rock show and will
generate violence and trouble,'' said Jarre, who attended
Thursday's meeting. ``But it is something else. It is a concert
dealing with architecture. It is an experience.''
   Objections have come from fire brigades and a local factory
worried about the planned fireworks display, and from a local
council and an ambulance authority citing the danger of traffic
congestion.

   Retired Maj. Ronald Ferguson, father of the
Duchess of York, says he is quitting his job as deputy chairman of
the swank Guards' Polo Club following a difference of opinion with
the group's executive committee.
   ``By mutual agreement I will be leaving next month,'' the
56-year-old ex-Army officer said in a statement Friday night. ``I
am very saddened.''
   Ferguson, the father of Prince Andrew's wife, Sarah, refused to
elaborate. But the Daily Mail said Thursday he was sacked from the
post that pays $47,320 a year after management consultants
criticized him for lacking business acumen.
   The London newspaper said the committee discussed the
consultants' confidential report in Ferguson's presence last week,
then gave him a letter telling him his contract would not be
renewed when it expires Oct. 31.
   His departure does not affect his position as personal polo
manager to Andrew's brother, Prince Charles.
   Ferguson joined the club in 1955 and has been deputy chairman
for more than 12 years.

   Iran and Iraq remained deadlocked at U.N.-mediated
peace talks and a recess appeared near after both sides publicly
accused the other of blocking progress.
   In a statement Friday, Iraq said talks cannot go anywhere unless
the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway is cleared and Iraq is allowed
free navigation in it. Shatt-al-Arab is Iraq's only outlet to the
sea and forms the southern boundary of the two nations.
   The statement was in response to comments Thursday by Iran's
foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati. Velayati told reporters that
Iran considered the two issues related to the waterway ``extraneous
elements'' that should be raised later in the talks.
   The Iraqi statement dismissed Iran's position as ``fantasy'' and
accused Tehran of wasting time.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20, clearing the
way for talks on a lasting settlement of the nearly 8-year-old
Persian Gulf war.
   Face-to-face meetings were held only on the first two days of
negotiations, and neither foreign minister has met U.N. mediator
Jan Eliasson since last Saturday. Lower-level contacts have
continued.
   Signs increased Friday that talks would be suspended over the
weekend before resuming in New York later this month.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Eliasson was expected to announce a recess and that the last few
days were spent haggling over a resumption date.
   Among Iran's priorities at the talks are a withdrawal of troops
to internationally recognized boundaries, exchange of war prisoners
and a U.N. investigation to determine who started the war.
   On the border question, the countries are at odds over a 1975
treaty setting the Iran-Iraq boundary down the middle of the
Shatt-al-Arab.
   Iraq has renounced the pact and claimed the entire waterway, but
Iran says it still considers the treaty valid.
   The waterway has been blocked by sunken ships since the start of
the Persian Gulf war in September 1980.

   Former President Chun Doo-hwan,
accused by opposition forces of corruption, has canceled plans to
attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games in Seoul, aides
said today.
   The aides quoted Chun as saying he did not want to cause trouble
at the Games and would stay away despite government plans to invite
him as an honored guest. The ceremonies are Sept. 17.
   Olympic organizers have invited Chun as one of South Korea's
three living ex-presidents, and government officials have said
Chun's role in bringing the Games to Seoul justified the invitation.
   The invitation triggered a strong opposition backlash. Chun, who
seized power with military backing in 1980, has faced a
parliamentary inquiry for alleged corruption and other wrongdoings
during his administration.
   Chun left office in February after a seven-year term.

   Hurricane Florence moved across the tip of
Louisiana and headed toward the Mississippi Gulf Coast on Friday
night, flogging coastal communities with 80 mph winds as thousands
of residents fled to higher ground. An Alabama man preparing for
the storm drowned while trying to tie down a boat.
   Winds were well below the 100 mph predicted while Florence was
offshore.
   ``When it's a hurricane I get out,'' said Melodia Buras, of
Boothville, La., who joined about 500 others Friday night at Belle
Chasse High School, which was opened as a shelter for Venice and
other Plaquemines Parish towns in coastal Louisiana.
   Shortly before midnight, the National Weather Service
discontinued its hurricane watch for western coast of Louisiana
from Morgan City to the Texas line.
   At 11 p.m., the center of the 250-mile wide storm was about 60
miles southeast of New Orleans, over the Mississippi Delta. The
weather service said it was moving north at 12-15 mph and its eye
was expected to continue in that direction and wind speed ovenight.
   The eye, about 30 miles wide, was expected to sideswipe eastern
New Orleans and hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast about 4 a.m.
   Forecasters warned coastal residents to prepare for 9-foot tides
and up to 10 inches of rain. Tornado watches were posted from
Pensacola, Fla., to Lake Charles, La.
   A Coast Guard helicopter had to abandon plans to rescue four men
on work barges trapped at the mouth of the Mississippi River, said
Coast Guard spokesman Dan Dewell. He said wind speeds there were at
over 90 mph.
   ``It looks like they're going to have to ride it out. The
hurricane, as well as I can make out, is right about there,'' said
Dewell.
   Earlier, a Coast Guard helicopter rescued two fishermen who got
into trouble while running their crab traps, also near the mouth of
the river.
   In Alabama, police in the coastal community of Orange Beach said
a 32-year-old man drowned Friday afternoon when he fell into the
water as he was trying to tie down a boat in windy, rainy
conditions.
   ``They were trying to secure a boat and one of their lines got
caught up underneath it,'' Cpl. Marvin Glass said. He said the man,
who could not swim, lost his balance tugging on the snagged line
and fell into a bayou, about half a mile from the Gulf.
   Luke Petrovich, Plaquemines Parish Council president, said that
as Florence passed over the Mississippi Delta parish, it knocked
out power to the homes of some 7,000 residents. About 1,600 of
those residents moved into evacuation centers. Others sought
shelter with friends and family on higher ground.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis postponed
indefinitely an outdoor rally at New Orleans' Jackson Square as
well as two indoor fund-raisers: a $1,000-per-couple cocktail party
and a $10,000-per-couple buffet.
   Florence, which had been stalled in the Gulf of Mexico, suddenly
strengthened into a hurricane Friday morning and began churning
northward at 15 mph, the National Hurricane Center reported.
   Maximum sustained wind speed near the storm's center was 80 mph
at 11 p.m., well over the 74 mph threshhold at which a tropical
storm is designated a hurricane, said Bob Sheets, director of the
hurricane center.
   An estimated 10,000 Mississippi coast residents moved to higher
ground, with more in Alabama and Louisiana, and students in parts
of Louisiana and Alabama were dismissed from classes early in
preparation for the hurricane.
   Evacuation shelters opened at late afternoon in the four states.
   Some Friday night high school football games were canceled.
   But not everyone was heading for higher ground. Curtis Mallon,
who lives on the tiny Dauphin Island, a barrier island off the
Alabama coast, said he wasn't leaving.
   ``Once you make up your mind to stay, all you can do is stay,''
Mallon said, boarding up his house.
   The training aircraft carrier USS Lexington, based at Pensacola
Naval Air Station, put out to sea Friday morning to ride out the
storm, said Navy spokeswoman Margaret Flowers.
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt declared a state of emergency Friday.
Alabama Emergency Management Director J. Danny Cooper said the
declaration would allow officials to cope with the potential side
effects of the hurricane, including the need for public shelters
and the possibility of tornadoes and flash floods.
   Cooper said motel space as far north as Montgomery had been
filled by evacuees.
   Mississippi Lt. Gov. Brad Dye, acting in behalf of Gov. Ray
Mabus, who was out of state, also declared a state of emergency to
activate the Mississippi Emergency Operations Center, which will
coordinate any needed clean up.
   From Taiwan, where he was on an industry-seeking mission,
Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer ordered the National Guard to stand by
for emergency duty.
   Boat owners moved their vessels to safe harbors.
   ``We've put everything we've got on land into the water. We tie
it good so if the tide goes up the boat goes up,'' said Randy
Speas, manager of Dog River Marina, south of Mobile, Ala.
   `We began evacuating the harbors Thursday and we are now in full
bore,'' said Wade Guice, who has headed Harrison County, Miss.,
civil defense for three decades. ``Shelters will be up and we'll be
doing all the other things we usually do when a hurricane
threatens.''
   In Louisiana, workers closed storm gates on bayous and canals
leading inland toward more heavily populated areas, beginning to
button up gaps in the ring of levees that surround metropolitan New
Orleans.
   The levees and big pumps keep the saucer-shaped New Orleans area
dry. At its highest point, New Orleans is about 14 feet above sea
level. Much of it is below sea level.
   Exactly 23 years ago Hurricane Betsy pushed a storm surge over
levees and flooded the eastern end of New Orleans, killing 70
people in Louisiana and causing $1.1 billion in damages.
   ``We have a more improved levee system and hurricane protection
system than we had 20 years ago,'' said Plaquemines Parish
President Luke Petrovich. ``We tripled the capacity of our drainage
pump systems and we've increased the height of our levees by about
20 percent.''
   At Grand Isle, La., a sandy strip just off the coast southwest
of New Orleans, Mayor Andy Valence ordered residents to evacuate.
   ``If they don't move out they will be arrested,'' Valence said.
``They will not be detained, but they will get a citation.''
   Residents in the affected areas were fortunate that strong wind
had stalled Florence on Thursday, preventing it from strengthening
for a day, forecaster Mark Zimmer said.
   ``It could have been worse,'' he said, noting that early
September is the height of the hurricane season, when wind and warm
water conditions are ideal for storm development.
   Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic season, is
the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimal hurricane
strength briefly before hitting the coast of Mexico last month.

   Senate Democrats are pressing ahead with a
package of economic sanctions against South Africa, but concede
that a united front of Republican opposition will probably keep the
measure from coming to a vote in the full chamber.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote next Wednesday
on the bill, which would impose a near-total trade embargo against
white-dominated South Africa and a near-total withdrawal of U.S.
investment in the country.
   Republican members of the panel, accusing Democrats of playing
election-year politics with the issue, refused a chance to offer
amendments to the bill on Friday. They said they prefer the bill as
it stands because it is so extensive that it will not attract
enough votes to cut off a filibuster on the Senate floor.
   ``My guess is that it will be approved by the committee,'' said
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a principal author of the legislation.
   ``But because the Republicans are apparently united it will not
have the votes to overcome a filibuster _ we won't get cloture _
that's the way it looks right now,'' said Simon.
   ``But even if we do nothing more than pass it out of committee,
it is a signal to South Africa that we want to change the system''
of forced racial separation known as apartheid, he said.
   Sixty votes are required in the 100-member Senate to invoke
cloture and cut off debate on a bill.
   The 1988 Democratic platform brands South Africa a terrorist
state and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has
supported sanctions. Republican presidential candidate George Bush
has opposed new sanctions on they ground they would remove any
leverage the United States may have to work for change in South
Africa.
   After a morning-long debate on the sanctions bill, Republican
committee member Sen. Dan Evans of Washington, told reporters:
   ``I think it's clearly, clearly pushed by domestic political
considerations and not be the urgency of the situation in South
Africa. I think the bill as it now sits will not have a single
Republican vote on the committee.''
   A coalition of Democrats and Republicans enacted a milder South
African sanctions bill two years ago over President Reagan's veto.
   Supporters of the present measure contend it is needed because
the earlier and less-sweeping bill has not forced the South African
government to end apartheid and to extend full citizenship rights
to the black majority.
   The House adopted a similar version of the far-reaching Senate
bill on Aug. 11.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Tough Sanctions Against Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved by voice vote stiff
economic sanctions against Iraq and condemned the alleged use of
poison gas by the Iraqi government against the country's Kurdish
minority.
   ``The Iraqi army is waging a campaign against the Kurdish
population that can only be described as genocide,'' Sen. Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I., said Friday just before the Senate passed the measure
just 18 hours after it was drafted.
   ``This is truly a crime against humanity. It is genocide, in
fact,'' said Pell, deploring the use of poison gas against Kurdish
civilians and the dynamiting of Kurdish villages.
   Reps. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., and John Porter, R-Ill., introduced
an identical measure in the House. The lawmakers, co-chairmen of
the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, also sent a letter to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein calling for an end to ``warfare against
the Kurdish population.''
   Sadoon Hamadi, minister of state for foreign affairs, repeated
denials Friday that any poison-gas attack had taken place. He said
independent observers might be permitted in the northern border
area of Iraq, where many of the Kurds live, if hostilities in the
region end.
   The bill, which was sent to the House, would require the U.S.
representative to international financial institutions such as the
World Bank to vote against all loans to Iraq.
   It would also bar all U.S. financial credits or credit
guarantees.
   Aides to Pell said this would immediately halt at least $800
million in credit or credit guarantees, a step they said would make
it even more difficult for Iraq to service its huge $60 billion
debt incurred during its eight-year war with neighboring Iran.
   The measure also would end the import of Iraqi oil into the
United States, end any U.S. economic or military aid and bar the
transfer to Iraq of sensitive high technology items subject to U.S.
export controls.
   The Pell aides, who declined to be identified, said the latter
step would prevent Iraq from importing vital spare parts for
equipment and technology already in the country, prevent it from
completing certain projects and bar the export to Iraq of such
items as computers, petroleum drilling equipment and air traffic
control equipment.
   Pell, stressing the bipartisan support on the foreign policy
issue, said he hoped the Reagan administration will quickly endorse
the bill.

   The House will recite the Pledge of Allegiance
twice next week under a plan pushed by Democrats after killing an
presidential election-year proposal by Republicans to open each
day's business with the pledge.
   Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., using one of GOP nominee George
Bush's frequent campaign themes, started it all Friday with a
resolution calling for a daily recitation of the pledge.
   Rowland was eventually ruled out of order and House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, took to the floor to defend the parliamentary
ruling and accused the GOP of playing politics with the pledge.
   Lest the Democrats be perceived as anti-pledge, however, Wright
said he would ask Reps. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the
Veterans Affairs Committee, and Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., to lead the
pledge on Tuesday and Wednesday next week.

<HEAD>Festival Lost In The Controversy Over Scorsese Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty films were presented at this year's
Venice Film Festival, but it was Martin Scorsese's ``The Last
Tempatation of Christ'' that monopolized attention, frustrating
directors who feared their work was lost in the controversy.
   Even before the festival began, the Italian media had dubbed it
``The Festival of Controversy'' because of protests against
Scorsese's film. It includes a sequence in which Jesus hallucinates
on the cross about abandoning his role as savior, marrying Mary
Magdalene and raising a family.
   Scorsese's film already had been under heavy attack in the
United States and elsewhere from some Christians and church groups.
   In Venice, the film was condemned by Roman Catholic bishops,
Vatican Radio, followers of excommunicated Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre and Italy's dominant Christian Democrat party.
   ``The importance of Scorsese comes from the fact that it was the
first screening in Europe and people were interested in seeing the
reaction in a society very different from America ... in the center
of the Catholic world,'' said Adriano Donaggio, spokesman for the
festival that ended Friday.
   Festival director Guglielmo Biraghi, a former critic, said he
welcomed the controversy as long as it was constructive. But some
directors feared their work would simply vanish in the fog
surrounding Scorsese and his film.
   Italian director Franco Zeffirelli once threatened to withdraw
his film, ``Il Giovane Toscanini'' (The Young Toscanini), because
he feared it could be overlooked if shown too close to Scorsese's.
   In the end, Zeffirelli left Venice in a huff, vowing never to
return. His film drew sustained applause from the Venice audience
but painful reviews from the critics.
   ``I have brought my film to Venice to satisfy the producers. I
did not want to come. Now I put on my crown of thorns and here I
am, on Calvary,'' he said at a news conference Monday.
   In a telling incident, Spanish director Pedro Almodovar angrily
returned to a news conference Wednesday moments after he left to
berate festival officials for excluding some Spanish journalists.
   But actually, it was the police who denied entry to the
late-arriving Spaniards. They feared the conference room already
was dangerously overcrowded. Hundreds were waiting for Scorsese,
who was greeted with an ovation when he arrived surrounded by
bodyguards.
   During the turbulent news conference, Scorsese defended his film
as a work of fiction, based on a novel. He said the film did not
seek to change anyone's religious convictions.
   The film was panned by many critics in Italy, who complained of
uninspired acting and banal dialouge. Still, Scorsese was seen by
many as a symbol of standing against censorship.
   ``The biggest problem at this festival was Scorsese,'' said
Donaggio. But he added that the Scorsese film was also one of the
festival's successes this year.
   The success, he said, was defending the right to show a
controversial film and let the public be the judge.

<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Yonkers City Council reversed itself
and approved a court-ordered housing desegregation plan early
Saturday, caving in as fines hit $1 million a day, hundreds of
workers faced layoffs and public opinion shifted against them.
   The 5-to-2 vote came at about 1:30 a.m. following a day of
meetings and discussions as pressure grew to resolve the crisis,
with hardliners in a raucous Yonkers City Hall condemning the
politicians who now supported the plan.
   As the final roll call was called and two of the four
recalcitrant councilmen, Peter Chema and Nicholas Longo, changed
their votes, a crowd of about 100 in the gallery at City Hall broke
into loud cheers.
   ``It's time to put behind the fines, the fight and the
turmoil,'' said Chema before switching his vote.
   But others in the audience were infuriated by the reversal. One
woman yelled,``You little snake'' at Chema, while another man
screeched at Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko, ``You sold us out, Nicky!
We'll remember!'' The mayor also voted for the plan.
   The city of 194,000 just north of New York City has incurred
$1.6 million in fines. Yonkers faced a $1 million fine Friday and
was to begin laying off hundreds of city workers Saturday. The
fines had started at $100 and doubled each day, reaching $819,200
Thursday for a total of $1,638,300.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who ordered the end to
segregated housing in Yonkers three years ago, will determine if
the city must pay Friday's fine.
   ``It's our understanding that if we pass this tonight, we will
not'' have to pay Friday's fine, city attorney Paul Pickelle said
before the vote.
   Wasicsko said he received a message from New York Secretary of
State Gail Schaffer, head of the state financial control board,
saying the layoffs set for Saturday had been rescinded by the state
Emergency Financial Control Board.
   Both Chema and Longo prefaced Saturday's roll-call vote with
long speeches saying they had reached agreements with the
plaintiffs to make changes in the ordinance, but also realized the
judge would not agree to those changes unless the councilmen
changed their votes.
   ``In the past we have thought of those fines somewhat in the
abstract,'' Longo said. ``It was the city being fined and the city
being affected ... the abstract has now become a reality.''
   The city has been in contempt of court for the council's refusal
to carry out the housing-desegregation order it approved earlier
this year.
   Among the modifications made in the housing decree under the
agreement with the plaintiffs was a commitment to build 100
stand-alone units, instead of the 200 previously approved, with the
rest to be part of other housing developments.
   Chema said they will also consider a home owners insurance
policy to make up the difference in a loss of property value when a
home owner sold a home.
   Changes in the plan worked out between the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People and the council members must
be approved by Sand, the U.S. Justice Department and the federal
department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Earlier, a lawyer for the NAACP, Michael Sussman, said the two
sides had ``hammered out a fairly complex agreement'' but that Sand
refused to consider the revised plan.
   Earlier Friday, the council and Wasicsko gathered and voted to
transfer $819,200 to pay Thursday's fine.
   As the councilmen entered City Hall, some of the crowd _ angered
by the report of negotiations _ shouted, ``Sellout! Sellout!'' But
another section applauded the vote to pay the fine, drawing a quick
response from Wasicsko.
   The fine payment came at a time where local support of the
opposition to Sand's plan was starting to wane.
   ``We've done all we can. We went to the Supreme Court and didn't
get anywhere,'' said Henry Knetter, 65, a northeast Yonkers
resident. ``There's no garbage pickup. There might not be any
police protection. It may be time to wise up.''
   Knetter spoke for an increasing number of local residents whose
ardent opposition to low-income housing has dwindled as the harsh
realities of Sand's stiff fines began hitting home.
   Phone lines at City Hall were jammed this week with callers
urging one of the adamant councilmen to change their vote, Wasicsko
said. Uncollected garbage sits outside many homes; children going
to school have no crossing guards; the three town libraries were to
close Saturday.
   ``They're (Yonkers residents) saying to the councilmen more and
more, `Hey, look, we give up. Just get this thing solved,''' said
Gov. Mario Cuomo in Albany.
   The fines _ which began at $100 per day, doubling daily until
hitting a $1 million-a-day cap on Friday _ forced the state
Emergency Financial Control Board to impose a ``Doomsday Plan''
aimed at providing public safety services while delaying bankruptcy.
   Phase One would have kicked in on Saturday, with 447 of the
city's 1,834 employees receiving layoffs notices as part of a $20
million savings package. The Parks and Recreation Department would
close, while the Planning Department would be slashed to two
employees.
   Other layoffs would come from the departments of real estate,
civil service, fiscal services and public works. Control board
Chairwoman Gail Shaffer, New York's secretary of state, said the
cuts were designed to keep Yonkers solvent until 1989.
   Sand, who in 1985 ruled the city had practiced segregation in
housing and education for 40 years, imposed the fines after the
four councilmen refused to implement part of his plan.
   City schools were desegregated under a Sand-approved plan, and
the City Council initially agreed to build 1,000 units of
low-income housing in January. They reversed field on the housing
at an Aug. 1 meeting, prompting Sand to impose fines which would
double every day.
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Sand's fines on appeal, but placed
the $1 million cap on the amount.

   After nearly 1{ weeks of preparation
and preliminaries in this seaside resort community, 51 contestants
are ready to find out tonight who will reign as Miss America 1989.
   Miss Utah Sophia Christine Symko played a classical piano
rhapsody and Miss Florida Melissa Aggeles wore a simple, white
``supersuit'' to victory Friday night in the last preliminary round
of the 62nd Miss America Pageant.
   The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary
swimsuit, talent and evening gown contests and interviews with the
judges compete to succeed Miss America 1988 Kaye Lani Rae Rafko.
The 10 finalists start with a clean slate in tonight's judging.
   Miss Symko, 21, of Salt Lake City, offered selections from
composer Franz Liszt's difficult ``Spanish Rhapsody,'' showing the
piano prowess she developed in 17 years of study.
   She said she was pleased with her playing. ``Of course, it's not
flawless, but I was very happy. I had a lot of fun with this.''
   Miss Symko said she selected the piece because it was both
formal and fun.
   Miss Utah, born in Oxford, England, is a graduate student at the
University of Utah pursuing her masters in physics. She plans to
attend medical school.
   Miss Aggeles, a 5-foot-8, 128-pound brunette who once was
``quite the tomboy'' wore a white competition supersuit, the
now-traditional, custom-designed suit said to hide flaws and
enhance assets.
   She was the second contestant to wear a white supersuit to
victory this week.
   Miss Aggeles, 24, credited her success to a six-month rigorous
training regime. ``All the hard work paid off,'' she said.
   In addition to weight training, Miss Aggeles said she stuck to a
rigid diet that actually caused her to gain 12 pounds. ``I was too
skinny,'' she said.
   Asked if she had done anything unnatural to enhance her figure,
Miss Aggeles laughed and said, ``I'm real.''
   The 24-year-old from St. Petersburg, Fla., graduated in 1987
from Florida State University. She hopes eventually to receive a
masters degree in fine arts from New York University, specializing
in classics and film, and aspires to a career on Broadway and in
film.
   In the meantime, as Miss Florida she hopes to implement a
program to reduce the number of high school dropouts called
``School is Cool.''
   Winners of the preliminary swimsuit competitions earlier this
week were Miss Louisiana Valerie Brosset and Miss Mississippi Carla
Haag, while the preliminary talent winners were Miss Oklahoma Lori
Lee Kelley and Miss Minnesota Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson.
   The top evening gown contestants have been kept secret to
heighten the suspense for the televised finals.
   The preliminary awards carry scholarships: $3,500 in the talent
division and $2,500 in the swimsuit competition.

<TEXT>
   After a month battling fires, Richard
Gearhart would like nothing more than a break. But he doesn't
expect one as the worst fires in Yellowstone National Park's
history burn unabated.
   ``We're real tired, that's for sure,'' Gearhart said Friday
while on the fire line near the tiny community of Silver Gate,
which has been under seige by blazes for a week.
   ``We could still go on, but we've been away a long time,'' he
said. ``We'd like to go home for just a few days, and then they
could bring us back.''
   Gearhart, a member of the Vista Grande Hot Shots from San
Bernadino, Calif., has been on the line 35 days. Normally
firefighters are released for several days after 21 days.
   But these are not normal times.
   More than 800,000 acres in nearby Yellowstone have burned. The
151,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire, one of several in and
around the park, persists in threatening Silver Gate and Cooke City
northeast of the park.
   Firefighters see no sign of an improvement, with high winds
forecast over the weekend that are expected to fan the flames.
   ``We are anticipating major fire activity,'' forest service
official Brian Avery said, adding that today ``may be the worst day
since this entire episode began.''
   Today was to have been the day Gearhart got a day off. But then,
so was Friday _ until Friday came.
   ``Now that this is a national emergency, maybe they'll keep us
even longer,'' he said.
   As a ``hot shot'' Gearhart and his fellow crew members are the
first on the lines of the most dangerous sections of fire.
   He works 12-16 hours a day wielding a chain saw with a blade
roughly 4 feet long, and sometimes has to hike 5 miles to reach the
lines.
   The smoke and ash that Gearhart breathes have left their mark on
his sooty face. As he walked along U.S. 212 on Friday, his sagging
shoulders and slow gait showed his weariness.
   But despite the hardships, he wasn't about to call it quits.
   ``We can't pack it in,'' he said. ``We have people that work for
the Forest Service full time, it's their job.
   ``It is our job,'' he added. ``We said we'd do it, you can't
really complain because we knew this could happen.''
   While there has been dispute over whether the thousands of
firefighters are actually fighting the flames or merely managing
their direction, Gearhart said he and his co-workers are doing
their best under poor conditions.
   When the fire's flames get to be 300 feet high, ``the fire can
do whatever it wants,'' he said.
   ``We're up against something that you really can't put out very
easily without weather cooperation,'' he said. ``We're basically
fighting (the fires) the way you have to do it, but it's just not
working out.''
   In his month on the Yellowstone fire lines, Gearhart has gotten
used to the danger of the work but hasn't forgotten who comes first.
   ``It's just trees and brush (burning),'' Gearhart said.
``They'll grow back, we won't. You just have to get out of the way
sometimes and let it do its thing.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Experts Arrive To Help Investigate Crash</HEAD>

   Investigators today examined the
wreckage of a Vietnamese jetliner to try to determine what caused
the plane to crash minutes before its scheduled landing.
Seventy-five people, including some government officials, were
killed.
   One of the pilots of Air Vietnam Flight 831 reported it was
struck by lightning, said Tran Van Viet, third secretary of the
Vietnamese Embassy. The pilot, Khong Din Phuong, was the only one
of the six survivors who was conscious.
   The Soviet-made Tu-134 slammed into a rice field four miles
short of Bangkok's airport Friday and blew up. The crash occurred
during a thunderstorm, three minutes before the jet was scheduled
to land after a flight from Hanoi.
   Vietnamese investigators flew to Thailand to help Thai officials
in the probe.
   Voice and flight recorders were retrieved from the wreckage,
said Maj. Gen. Sopol Savigamin, a regional police commander. The
cockpit recorder contains conversation between the crew and the
airport control tower, and the flight recorder contains flight data.
   The passenger list included 50 Vietnamese, 11 Indians, eight
Poles, three Japanese, three Frenchmen, two Finns, two Swedes, one
Burmese and two others of unknown nationality. That totals 82, but
one person did not board the plane.
   Nguyen Van Quan, a Vietnamese Embassy official, said the dead
included Vietnam's Minister of Public Health, Dang Hoi Huan, and
its ambassador-designate to the Philippines, Nguyen Dhuong Vu, who
was on the way to take up his post.
   Quan said other Vietnamese victims included many lower-ranking
government officials on their way to conferences in Thailand, Japan
and other countries.
   India's ambassador to Vietnam, Arun Patwardhan, 48, was killed
along with seven other officials of India's Hanoi embassy, an
Indian consular officer in Bangkok said.
   The Japanese Embassy in Bangkok said the second secretary of the
Japanese Embassy in Hanoi, Kiyokata Ida, and two Japanese
businessmen were killed.
   Details on other victims were not available.
   Sopol said workers retrieved 75 bodies Friday. A Frenchman, a
Polish woman, the pilot and three other Vietnamese remained in
intensive care at Bhumibol Hospital.
   Hundreds of police, air force workers and volunteers hauled
bodies from a rice paddy, wrapping them in the thin beige-colored
cloth. The last two bodies, those of a man and a woman, were found
lying by lily pads after workers pumped the pond dry.
   Scattered over the area were earrings, a shell necklace, toy
plastic gun, seat cushions, backpacks, passports and more than 10
bags of diplomatic mail for the Australian Embassy in Bangkok.
   The twin-engine Tu-134 is the Vietnamese flag carrier's mainstay
aircraft.
   According to Jane's All The World's Aircraft, Tu-134s seat from
80 to 96 people. Vietnamese officials have said they would like to
switch to Boeings, Airbuses and other newer, Western-made planes
but do not have the money.

   The new political fire and brimstone in Michael Dukakis' blasts
at George Bush left black Baptist ministers shouting in Texas.
Flag-waving thousands thundered when the GOP candidate proclaimed
in Pennsylvania that he's questioning the judgment _ not the
patriotism _ of his Democratic rival.
   ``In just 60 days we can choose a president who will enforce
civil rights laws, not veto them,'' Dukakis told a meeting of the
National Baptist Convention U.S.A., a large, predominantly black
religious group, in Dallas Friday. He also advocated giving Old
Glory another star: Statehood for the District of Columbia.
   Dukakis' talks earlier this week often seemed flat and attracted
generally lukewarm applause. But this time he spoke like a preacher
at a revival and drew one of the best receptions of his campaign.
   Over and over, he told the crowd the election is only 60 days
away. And from the crowd, comprised largely of black ministers,
came loud shouts: ``Just 60 days.''
   Moments earlier, the group heard Jesse Jackson urge them to
``accept my recommendation'' and join him, a former rival for the
Democratic nomination, in backing Dukakis on Election Day. ``He can
be trusted to help keep hope alive,'' said Jackson, who slapped at
Bush and GOP ticketmate Dan Quayle.
   ``Why do I support Michael Dukakis? Why do I ask you to go and
support him with fervor? Because Bush does not care and Quayle does
not understand. Dukakis cares and understands,'' Jackson added.
   Bush, swinging through Illinois and Pennsylvania in search of
their crucial electoral votes, hammered at Dukakis on defense
issues Friday. He accused the Democrat of contradictions and
confusion about the fate of the Strategic Defense Initiative _ Star
Wars _ when Ronald Reagan vacates the White House.
   ``Calling it a fantasy one day, something he won't rule out the
next ... suggests a confusion in my view on the basic facts, a
confusion in terms of what he really believes and where he would
take this country,'' Bush told a group of Republican women in
Rockford, Ill.
   Dukakis suggested Republican attacks on him are similar to
Joseph McCarthy's accusations and other controversial tactics in
earlier eras. ``Just as they did to (President) Franklin Roosevelt
and (House Speaker) Sam Rayburn, they're now attacking my
patriotism,'' Dukakis said.
   ``And just as they did in the 1930s and 1950s, the American
people can smell the garbage,'' he added.
   Bush's audience at a flag-waving rally in York, Pa., roared when
the vice president said: ``I understand that today the liberal
governor of Massachusetts attacked me for questioning the
patriotism, his patriotism. I'm not questioning his patriotism. I'm
questioning his judgment.''
   While Bush returned to Washington for a weekend away from the
campaign trail, Dukakis was back in Boston to study defense issues
before dealing with military and foreign policy matters in speeches
next week.
   Three of the Democrats' chief defense experts in Congress _
Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia and John Glenn of Ohio, and Rep. Les
Aspin of Wisconsin _ arranged meetings with Dukakis today and
Sunday, said Dayton Duncan, Dukakis' press secretary.
   Top aides, developing plans for a pair of presidential debates,
agreed Friday that the second round between Bush and Dukakis will
be in Los Angeles, said the Democrat's campaign chairman Paul
Brountas.
   Brountas and Bush campaign leader James Baker had decided
earlier to have round one in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Sept. 25, with
the second debate either Oct. 13 or Oct. 14 _ depending on the
American League baseball playoff series. Both debates are expected
to be general in subject matter.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic vice presidential
nominee, pounded at the Republicans on labor issues Friday in
California, and also took the 60-day theme.
   Bentsen joined in a Democratic roast of the GOP's opposition to
legislation that requires giving workers 60 days notice of plant
closings or large-scale layoffs. Democrats around the country
passed out pink slips, saying they were putting the Republicans on
notice their days in office are numbered.
   Bentsen told a cheering crowd at a union hall in Bloomington,
Calif.: ``We're here today to give the Republicans a better break
than they give the American worker.''
   ``Sure, we could provide notice the Republican way. We could go
there election eve and change the locks on the door,'' said
Bentsen. ``We could take the vice president's White House mess card
and cancel that. And we could take away Air Force II. But we agree
with the vast majority of the American people who say 60 days'
notice is fair.''
   Quayle, meantime, said Friday he got into law school ``fair and
square'' _ not through an affirmative action program aimed at
helping minorities. ``No rules were broken,'' he added.
   Earlier Friday, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported the
admissions program Quayle went through in 1970 was intended to
offer equal opportunity to members of minority groups, the
economically disadvantaged, and other ``students of different
viewpoints and backgrounds.''
   While Quayle was touring metals plants in Ohio, his Washington
office released financial records Friday showing he and his wife
own assets worth an estimated $1.4 million.

<HEAD>Vietnam Envoy Says May Be A Real Gun, Plus Toy, At Embassy</HEAD>

   Vietnam's ambassador turned in a toy gun and said
it was the weapon brandished by a Vietnamese diplomat during a
demonstration, the Foreign Office said.
   A Foreign Office official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Friday that Ambassador Tran Van Hung acknowledged there may
also be a real gun in the embassy.
   The ambassador, who was summoned to the Foreign Office, handed
over the toy gun and was told to check whether there was a real gun
and report back, the official said.
   Telephone calls seeking comment from the embassy were not
answered Friday evening.
   On Thursday, the ambassador agreed to give up the diplomatic
immunity of a third secretary who allegedly waved a gun at
British-based Vietnamese refugees during a protest outside the
embassy on Sunday. The demonstrators took photographs, which were
published in London's Daily Express.
   The Foreign Office has said it takes a very serious view of the
incident and warned the ambassador this week of the ``gravest
consequences'' unless the diplomat's immunity was waived.
   Third Secretary Khang Than Nhan, who is accused of brandishing
the weapon, may now be questioned by police and, if necessary,
charged or expelled.
   Diplomatic missions in Britain not supposed to have weapons, and
the government has taken violations seriously since a gunman firing
from the Libyan Embassy killed a London policewoman during a
protest in April 1984.

<TEXT>
   The last hotels and
campgrounds in fire-blackened Yellowstone National Park were closed
as firefighters braced for high winds expected to create the worst
wildfire conditions this summer.
   ``Our weather for the next few days is really what everything is
going to hinge on,'' U.S. Forest Service official Brian Avery said
Friday. ``If we can get through the next 24 to 36 hours, we should
be in good shape.''
   Safety precautions were stepped up after a firefighter was
killed by a falling tree in Montana Friday, the first death
directly attributed to the fires, and a helicopter disappeared in a
rugged area of a Washington forest.
   Park officials closed the Mammoth Hot Springs Inn, the last
lodging open in the 2.2 million-acre park, as flames from a
222,000-acre fire came within 3 miles of the area. Winds pushed the
fire to the north and northeast, skirting the area.
   Forecasters called for gusts to 60 mph today. Firefighters
feared conditions would be worse than on Aug. 20, dubbed ``Black
Saturday,'' when winds whipped flames into a 150,000-acre blaze
through the park in a single day, fire officials said.
   ``(Today) may be the worst day since this entire episode
began,'' Avery said.
   However, the winds herald the arrival of a storm front over
Wyoming that could bring lower temperatures and scattered showers
to Yellowstone late tonight or Sunday.
   The top fire priority was a 263,000-acre blaze in the northeast
quarter of the park and neighboring Shoshone National Forest, Avery
said.
   About 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were sent Friday
to the blazes in the Yellowstone area that covered nearly 2 million
acres in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Officials were looking forward
to the arrival of additional personnel and equipment from Canada.
   President Reagan signed emergency legislation Friday clearing
the way for Canada to send the aid to Yellowstone.
   By Friday, 13 fires had burned almost 1.2 million acres in the
Yellowstone area. In the 2.2 million-acre park itself, 816,225
acres have burned.
   Fires also burned Friday in Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Utah and Washington.
   So far this year, 68,396 fires in the West have burned nearly
3.8 million acres, an area larger than Connecticut, in what federal
officials have called the worst fire season in 30 years.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel and Undersecretary of Devense William Howard Taft IV planned
to inspect the damage today during a visit to West Yellowstone,
Mont.
   The group planned to talk with fire command staffers at West
Yellowstone, tour Old Faithful geyser and fly over Cooke City and
Silver Gate, Mont., where residents were twice evacuated, then hold
a public meeting in Cody.
   Only the park's northern and western entrances remained open and
visitors had free access to just 19 miles of road.
   Firefighters emphasized safety, posting one person in each crew
to watch for falling trees, information officer Jim Payne said
following Friday's fatal accident.
   Patrick F. David, 26, a firefighter from Bonner's Ferry, Idaho,
was killed when a burning tree fell on him and four companions,
officials said.
   ``There are tons of snags in the area that are smoldering and do
and can fall over at any time,'' Payne said. ``We don't want any
more injuries out there.''
   In Washington state, a ground search was set for today for a
private helicopter that disappeared Friday evening while helping
fight the state's largest wildfire. The aircraft vanished after
refueling and heading back toward the fire, said Chelan County
sheriff's dispatcher Bud Fritz.
   Officials did not know how many were aboard the two-seater Bell
Jet Ranger, leased by the state Department of Natural Resources, or
what its mission was. However, they said it may have put down
because of mechanical failure or approaching darkness.
   The helicopter's disappearance capped a difficult day for
firefighters battling a 43,000-acre fire, which flared up and grew
by 6,000 acres Friday afternoon.
   In Idaho, more than 3,000 firefighters are battling blazes that
have scorched about 210,000 acres and remain out of control. In
eastern Utah, forest service officials mobilized an army of 700
firefighters for a weekend assault on an blaze that has blackened
16,600 acres of Ashley National Forest.
   Some 500 firefighters in Colorado fought to control blazes that
have scorched more than 11,000 acres.

<HEAD>Times: Ex-Chairman of Ashland Oil Secretly Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc.'s former chairman and a
business associate were secretly arrested for transporting stolen
company documents sought by Iran for use in its $500 million
lawsuit against Ashland, The New York Times reported today.
   Orin E. Atkins was arrested in Manhattan in July after U.S.
Customs agents videotaped him telling a business associate to sell
a pair of confidential 1979 Ashland memos to the Iranian government
for $600,000, the newspaper said.
   The associate, Roy Furmark, was also arrested in July, the Times
said.
   The arrests were kept secret as authorities tried to pursue the
Iranians involved in the incident, the newspaper said.
   Unidentified law enforcement officials told the Times that
Atkins pleaded innocent after his arrest and was released.
   Atkins' attorneys, John E. Jenkins Jr. and Martin Pollner,
confirmed their client was arrested for interstate transportation
of stolen property, the newspaper said.
   ``When all the facts are known, Atkins will be totally
exonerated,'' said a statement released by a third Atkins attorney,
John Lang.
   According to papers filed in federal court in Manhattan, two
other people were charged with interstate transportation of stolen
property: ex-Ashland vice president Charles Dugan and attorney
Charles Barnett, whose late father did legal work for Atkins and
Ashland.
   Both pleaded innocent, the Times said.
   The lawsuit stems from oil contracts between Iran and Ashland.
Part of it focused on seven Iranian oil tankers which Ashland
acquired but did not pay for during the oil crunch of 1979.
   The federal probe began after Ashland, concerned over reports of
stolen documents for sale, hired private investigators to check
into the allegations, the Times said.

<TEXT>
   Heavy rains today exacerbated flood
conditions in Bangladesh, causing swelling of major rivers that
were already well above flood level, officials said.
   Officials at flood control centers told The Associated Press
that flooding worsened in 12 districts where, earlier in the week,
the water level of major rivers had been receding.
   The floods have covered three-quarters of Bangladesh and left
one-fourth of its 110 million people homeless.
   Dhaka newspapers put the death toll from flooding at 1,402. The
government's count remained at 609 and is considered far too low.
   The International Red Cross on Friday said the floods had
claimed 637 lives.
   Officials reported an outbreak of diarrhea in all areas affected
by the floods. By Friday evening at least 160,872 people had been
afflicted by the illness and 102 had died from it, the officials
said.
   In Dhaka, a city of 6 million, 21,412 new cases of diarrhea were
reported Friday by the government health center.
   The rains Friday and early today added to hardships already
suffered by millions living on roofs and treetops and huddled
together in thousands of camps nationwide without safe drinking
water, cooked food or medical care.
   Health Ministry officials said 30,035 health workers were
working around the clock to aid victims of water-borne diseases.
The officials acknowledged, however, that there was not enough
medicine to help all those affected by the flooding.
   Millions of gallons of raw sewage and tons of garbage dumped
into floodwaters in Dhaka posed a serious medical threat to the
capital's population, a senior official at the Dhaka Municipal
Corp. said. He said the Buriganga River, which carried all the
city's sewage, was now mixing with the floodwater.
   Health officials have estimated that 40 million gallons of raw
sewage a day are being dumped into stagnating floodwaters where
children swim for fun and adults wade to food markets and relief
centers.
   A senior official at the Agriculture Ministry said that ``if the
water does not recede in the next couple of days, most of the rice
crop will be damaged beyond any recovery.''
   The government has 1.3 million tons of grain and has issued an
appeal for 3 million tons to compensate for damage to the rice crop.

<BYLINE>Radicals Demonstrating Against Olympics Clash With Police

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students yelling ``Oppose
dictatorial Olympics!'' hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police
today. Student leaders charged the Games were being used to cement
military rule.
   About 2,000 students from several Seoul colleges rallied at the
capital's Yonsei University, denouncing the Olympics, President Roh
Tae-woo's government and the United States for backing the
government.
   ``Down with military dictatorship,'' the students chanted as
they marched around the campus with red, white and blue flags.
   The students, some armed with wooden and iron clubs, then
marched out of the school to confront hundreds of riot police who
were surrounding the campus. Protesters taunted the police and then
attacked.
   Waves of masked students rushed out of the school's gates and
climbed over walls to pelt police with firebombs that exploded in
orange balls of blazing gasoline. The firebombs exploded among the
police, setting fire to troopers' shields and clothing.
   Police, dressed in green combat fatigues and black visored
helmets, did not use tear gas because of government orders not to
use the powerful gas during the Olympics. They also hurled back
fewer rocks than in similar protests in the past.
   Police said they had no reports of arrests or injuries. The
clash lasted about 30 minutes and was confined to the highway in
front of the school.
   Student and dissident leaders speaking at the rally charged the
Roh government with using the Olympics, which begin Sept. 17, to
cement authoritarian rule.
   ``The Olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime,''
said a statement by the protesters. ``The regime is making all out
efforts to weaken the people's power.''
   Speakers charged the United States with conspiring with Roh to
continue military rule. The United States has about 42,000 troops
in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Radical leaders have called for anti-Olympic protests, but the
protests so far have been confined to a few campuses in Seoul and
several other cities. There have been no demonstrations near
Olympic sites.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have
virtually no public support. Most Koreans are critical of protests
against the Olympics and want nothing to disrupt the Games.
   Roh, a former general who won presidential elections in
December, has introduced broad democratic reforms and dismantled
authoritarian controls.

<HEAD>Yonkers City Council Approves Housing Desegregation Plan, Ending
Fines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Yonkers City Council reversed itself
and approved a court-ordered housing desegregation plan today,
backing down in the face of $1 million-a-day fines, threatened
layoffs of city workers and a shift in public opinion.
   Two of the four councilmen long opposed to the plan relented
when confronted with the prospect of garbage rotting on the
sidewalks, closed libraries and skeleton crews of firefighters and
police.
   The 5-to-2 vote came at about 1:30 a.m. after a day of meetings
in which pressure grew to resolve the weeks-old crisis. It followed
a raucous City Hall session before about 100 spectators in which
hard-liners condemned politicians who supported the plan.
   ``In the past we have thought of those fines somewhat in the
abstract. The abstract has now become a reality,'' said Nicholas
Longo, one of the two councilmen who changed their vote. ``The
thing that most affected me was looking over a list of people who,
at the stroke of midnight, would become unemployed.'
   In long speeches before the vote, Longo and Peter Chema, the
second councilman who changed his position, said they reached
agreement Friday with the plaintiffs to modify the plan.
   The councilmen said they realized U.S. District Judge Leonard
Sand would not agree to the changes unless the councilmen changed
their votes.
   The modifications worked out between the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People and the councilmen must be
approved by Sand, the U.S. Justice Department and the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Sand, who ordered the end to segregated housing in Yonkers three
years ago, was to determine if the city must pay Friday's fine, the
first million-dollar penalty.
   City attorney Paul W. Pickelle, speaking before the vote, said
it was his understanding that if the council approved the plan at
the session that began Friday night, the city would not have to pay
Thursday's or Friday's fines.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko said he received a message early today
from New York Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, head of the state
Emergency Financial Control Board, that the layoffs had been
rescinded. The board had taken control of the city's finances and
devised a ``doomsday'' budget.
   The desegregation lawsuit was brought by the Justice Department
in 1980 and joined by the NAACP.
   The councilmen's speeches, however, failed to persuade some
opponents of the housing plan.
   ``You little snake,'' one woman yelled at Chema.
   ``You sold us out, Nicky! We'll remember!'' a man yelled at
Wasicsko, who supported the plan.
   The fines had started at $100 and doubled each day, reaching
$819,200 Thursday for a total of $1,638,300. In addition to
Friday's $1 million fine, the city was to begin laying off hundreds
of city workers today under the state-mandated budget.
   Sand ruled Aug. 2 that the New York suburb of 194,000 was in
contempt of court for the council's refusal to carry out a
housing-desegregation plan it approved earlier this year.
   The plan calls for 200 units of low-income public housing
scattered throughout mainly white neighborhoods and 800 units of
middle-income subsidized housing scattered throughout Yonkers.
   The modified plan would reduce the number of stand-alone
townhouses and establish a non-profit agency to manage the
low-income units rather than have them managed by the Municipal
Housing Authority, Longo said.
   Councilmen Henry Spallone and Edward Fagan Jr. continued to vote
against the housing plan.
   The vote came as support for the opposition to Sand's plan began
to wane.
   ``We've done all we can. We went to the Supreme Court and didn't
get anywhere,'' said resident Henry Knetter, 65. ``There's no
garbage pickup. There might not be any police protection. It may be
time to wise up.''
   Phone lines at City Hall were jammed this week with callers
urging the recalcitrant councilmen to change their votes.
   Sand, who ruled in 1985 the city had practiced segregation in
housing and education for 40 years, imposed the fines after the
City Council voted 4-3 against implementing the housing plan.
   City schools were desegregated under a Sand-approved plan, and
the City Council initially agreed to build 1,000 units of
low-income housing in January. They reversed on the housing at an
Aug. 1 meeting, prompting Sand to impose the fines.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Sept. 1 upheld Sand's fines on appeal,
but also upheld a $1 million-a-day cap imposed by an appeals court.
   Sand also imposed personal fines of $500 a day on the dissenting
councilmen, but the Supreme Court suspended the penalties.

<HEAD>Task Force Proposes Allowing Chinese To Visit Taiwan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government task force today proposed
easing a 39-year-old travel ban so residents of Communist China can
come to Taiwan to visit sick relatives, officials said.
   The Cabinet task force proposed that mainland Chinese be allowed
to enter Taiwan to visit spouses, parents or children who are
gravely ill or seriously injured, a Government Information Office
statement said. The trips would be restricted to two months.
   Visits to attend funerals of close relatives also would be
allowed, the statement said.
   The proposal will be submitted soon to Premier Yu Kuo-hwa for
approval, it said.
   The task force, headed by Vice Premier Shih Chi-yang, was
established last month to map out Nationalist policies toward China.
   The Chinese Nationalist government and about 2 million
supporters fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to
Communist forces on the Chinese mainland. Many of the people who
fled to this island left close relatives behind.
   Nationalist authorities banned all official contact with the
Communist government in Beijing but last year eased a ban on travel
to the Chinese mainland to allow Taiwan residents to visit
relatives.
   Mainland Chinese who have been members of the Chinese Communist
Party or have taken part in ``any seditious groups'' would still be
banned from entering Taiwan, according to the proposal.

<HEAD>Authorities: Man Tried to Kill Wife Two Years After Slaying
Sister-in-Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of raping and killing his
sister-in-law because ``women flaunt their bodies'' dug the
teen-ager's grave two days before she was slain, and planned a
similar fate for his wife, authorities say.
   ``I'll make you disappear just like Carla (Lenz) disappeared,''
John R. Weber told his wife, Emily, according to a criminal
complaint by Assistant District Attorney Paul L. Barnett.
   Mrs. Weber, who said she was struck 20 times with a shovel, was
in serious condition at a hospital Friday.
   Weber, 24, was charged in Circuit Court in this northern
Wisconsin city Friday with first-degree murder, first-degree sexual
assault, kidnapping, false imprisonment and attempted first-degree
murder. Bond was set at $200,000.
   Weber prepared a grave for his wife and forced her to write
letters explaining her absence, Price County authorities said.
   The skeletal remains of Miss Lenz, a 17-year-old high school
senior who disappeared in November 1986, were found in a grave in
the woods Wednesday.
   Authorities looked for the remains after they happened on a tape
recording describing the death of Miss Lenz, Mrs. Weber's sister,
while investigating a report Weber had beaten his wife.
   Weber planned to use the tape to terrify his wife, according to
a criminal complaint filed by Barnett.
   The recording said the teen-ager died because ``women flaunt
their bodies and think they can get anything they want.''
   Mrs. Weber ``won't be the last,'' it said. ``There will be
others, many others.''
   The complaint said that, as Weber beat his wife, he was
surprised she kept getting up, and told her ``you're going to be a
tough one to kill.''
   The remains found Wednesday in the township of Flambeau were
identified as Miss Lenz's through dental records.
   According to the complaint, Weber provided investigators with a
map to the grave and asked that she be given a Christian burial.
   The cause of the girl's death was not determined, Sheriff Wayne
Wirsing said.
   If convicted, Weber could be sentenced to life in prison plus
100 years, Barnett said.

   Arthur Encalade was philosophical about
Florence, the hurricane that chased him from his home exactly 23
years after an equally rude uprooting at the hands of Hurricane
Betsy.
   As he sat among 1,200 other evacuees at Belle Chasse High School
just south of New Orleans on Friday night, the 69-year-old Encalade
said living through storms is a way of life.
   ``People live all their lives down here,'' he said. ``You hate
to leave. You go somewhere else and a tornado will take you or
something else will.
   ``It's discouraging, but what are you going to do?'' he said.
``If you're too old, you can't go far.''
   Florence was at hurricane strength Friday when the evacuees left
their low-lying homes, but lost its punch as it brushed the coast
and was downgraded to a tropical storm this morning.
   Thousands of residents of coastal areas in Mississippi, Alabama
and Florida also took refuge in shelters and homes of relatives and
friends on higher ground.
   Despite an almost casual acceptance of his situation, Encalade
said previous storms have cost him dearly.
   ``When Camille (in 1969) and Betsy came over, they cleaned us
out. I lost two houses,'' he said.
   Now Encalade lives in a trailer in Buras on the tip of the
Mississippi Delta.
   ``We've got it anchored,'' he said. ``But if the storm passes
over it's going to take it anyway. So you just lock it up and come
up here and see what happens.''
   At the school, cots were set up in the gym, with large families
grouped in classrooms. Some people brought TV sets and suitcases
with changes of clothes.
   Sitting on cots, Walter and Melodia Buras of Boothville were a
little more pragmatic than Encalade.
   ``I've been in this school three times already,'' Mrs. Buras
said. ``Once for Betsy and once for Camille. When it's a hurricane,
I'm gone.''
   They said they normally ride out weaker storms at home, but
anytime a hurricane nears shore they head for higher ground.
   Mrs. Buras said her quick departures when bad weather threatens
sometimes draw jokes from neighbors.
   ``They laugh at us when we get back, but I'd rather be safe.''
   Many shared the same outlook at St. Bernard High School east of
New Orleans, where 170 evacuees took refuge.
   ``Where we live is `God's Little Acre,''' said Ruth Gonzales,
65, of Delcroix Island. ``It's the best place to live even though
every time a storm comes through, we've got to go.''
   So why not move?
   ``If our home's destroyed, we'll make another government loan
and build again,'' she said.

   A lawsuit that seeks to redress alleged
discrimination against Hispanics will represent a fundamental
reordering of political priorities in the nation's most populous
county, Hispanic leaders say.
   The suit, filed this week by the Justice Department in U.S.
District Court, alleges that county officials discriminated against
Hispanics by drawing political boundaries so as to dilute the
influence of Hispanic voters.
   ``It should have happened years ago,'' said Joseph M. Sanchez,
55, president of a thriving grocery business who was the first
Mexican-American to serve on the city's Board of Fire
Commissioners. ``I'm just so excited about it.''
   Sanchez predicted that changing the electoral districts would
lead to higher voter turnout because of the likelihood that
Hispanic candidates will run for the Board of Supervisors.
   Sanchez and others said they expect redistricting will result in
changes in county government services, particularly in health care,
zoning, police protection and social services.
   A similar Justice Department case against the city government in
1985 resulted in redrawn boundaries in which Hispanics comprise a
majority in at least three of the city's 15 council districts.
   Hispanic leaders say far more is at stake in the county
redistricting case.
   For one thing, no Hispanic or any other minority group member
has ever been elected to the county Board of Supervisors.
   Yet the percentage of Hispanics in the county is at least 27
percent, with blacks comprising more than 12 percent and Asians
about 5.8 percent, according to the lawsuit.
   ``Without a doubt, at least in Los Angeles, the County Board of
Supervisors is one of the most powerful elected bodies in
government,'' said City Councilman Richard Alatorre.
   ``Being elected to the Board of Supervisors is like being
elected pope,'' Alatorre said. ``They're the five gods.''
   ``I call them the five kings, and a lot of people call them the
five kings because of their imperial manner,'' said Alan Clayton, a
state civil rights representative for the League of United Latin
American Citizens.
   Such an appraisal is due in large part to the sheer size of
county government. The Board of Supervisors controls a budget of
nearly $9 billion, compared to the city's budget of roughly $3.5
billion.
   The county's population, estimated at 8.5 million, is greater
than that in each of 42 states.
   Roughly translated, that means that each of the five supervisors
has a constituency of 1.6 million to 1.7 million people.
   In comparison, the ideal population set for U.S. Congressional
Districts during the reapportionment of the early 1980s was a mere
526,000.
   And at 2,615 square miles, the county's 5th District seat in
northern Los Angeles County is bigger than the state of Delaware.
   Such huge numbers, Clayton said, means that immense power is
concentrated in the hands of a very few.
   Conversely, Clayton added, mounting a political challenge
against an incumbent supervisor requires tremendous financial
resources.
   Striking a conciliatory tone, Board of Supervisors Chairman
Deane Dana said the suit has left the five-member board with little
choice ``except to redraw our lines.''
   Hispanic community leaders sounded ecstatic about the prospects
of change to be wrought by the voting rights case.
   ``Hispanic groups have experienced a `tough guy' kind of
attitude from the Board of Supervisors when they protested over
clinics that have been closed,'' said City Councilwoman Gloria
Molina.
   The Justice Department's intervention, Ms. Molina said, is
``sending a tremendously positive message to a Hispanic community
that felt they had no place to go in terms of political redress.''
   Ms. Molina, who was elected to represent east Los Angeles in
February 1987, was one of the first politicians to benefit from the
city's redistricting case, and she believes that she has brought
important changes to the council.
   ``Having a Hispanic on the City Council has created kind of an
attitude change,'' Ms. Molina said. ``Before, there were many
issues that were not addressed.''

   Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo and civic activist Samuel
S. Beard faced off in a Democratic primary today to determine who
will try to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. William B. Roth.
   Voter turnout was critical in today's race, the only statewide
competition in the primary. Volunteers from both camps planned to
canvass door-to-door and by telephone, as well as provide
transportation to the polls.
   A light turnout was expected to favor Beard, who was backed by
unions and party regulars who traditionally go to the polls in
force.
   A heavy turnout was considered good for Woo, whose main support
comes from college students and younger groups.
   Polls opened at 7 a.m. and were to close at 8 p.m.
   ``We're making sure we're real well-organized and getting our
people out,'' Woo's deputy campaign manager, Jack Markell, said
Friday.
   A poll conducted late last month for the Wilmington News-Journal
newspapers gave Woo 45 percent of the vote and Beard 31 percent.
Twenty-four percent of the likely voters polled were undecided.
   Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the University of
Delaware, was elected lieutenant governor four years ago in his
first bid for public office.
   A native of Shanghai, China, he became a symbol of success by
Asian-Americans.
   Woo was considered a shoo-in for another term as lieutenant
governor, but instead chose to challenge Roth, who is seeking his
fourth term.
   However, Democrats complained Woo is not loyal to the party and
threw their support behind Beard.
   Beard, 49, is a former staffer of the late Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, D-N.Y. He owns a non-profit company that helps obtain
grants to attract economic devleopment.
   Woo apparently won the battle for campaign donations.
   By late August, he had raised $407,998, with most of the money
from the Asian-American community. Beard raised $65,008. Roth, who
runs unopposed in the primary, had $734,933.

<HEAD>Florence Whips Gulf Coast, Spreads Rain as Far North as New Jersey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical storm Florence whipped the Gulf Coast with severe winds
today and spread rain as far north as southern New Jersey.
   The storm's strength diminished, and it was downgraded from
hurricane status as it passed by New Orleans and headed for
Mississippi.
   Hurricane warnings had been posted from near Morgan City, La.,
through to Pensacola, Fla., and tropical storm warnings for winds
to 50 mph were posted from Pensacola to Apalachicola, Fla.
   Tides were expected to run as much as 9 feet above normal and
between 5 and 10 inches of rain was likely in areas covered by the
hurricane warning. The Naval Air Station near New Orleans recorded
just under 2{ inches of rain in the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT.
   The storm system's northern edge cast rain over Virginia,
Maryland, Delaware and southern New Jersey.
   Most of the rest of the country was dry.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across
Gulf Coast states from Louisana to the Florida Panhandle and into
Georgia and eastern Tennessee. Widely scattered showers were
expected in central Montana and the mountains of Wyoming.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 60s from the upper Missouri
Valley to the northern Pacific Coast; in the 70s from the rest of
the northern Pacific Coast across the northern Rockies, northern
North Dakota, northern Minnesota, the Great Lakes and northern New
England; in the 90s in the lower and central plains; and near 110
degrees in the desert Southwest; and mostly in the 80s elsewhere.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 37 degrees at Hibbing,
Minn., to 92 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

   About 50 people attended the first
showing of the controversial film, ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' after a federal judge blocked a first-in-the-nation
county ordinance banning theaters from showing it.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson issued a preliminary injunction
Friday to stop enforcement of the ordinance, saying it was
unconstitutional.
   Vinson added that ``red flags should run up'' whenever
government tries to violate the rights of citizens.
   The ordinance had called for a maximum penalty of up to a $500
fine and 60 days in jail for showing the film.
   About a dozen pickets were at the Plaza III Theaters for the
movie's debut Friday, but there was no violence.
   In their complaint against the ordinance, the movie's director,
Martin Scorsese, and Plitt Theaters Inc. said Escambia County was
the first local government to ban the film outright, although
others have passed resolutions opposing it.
   County commissioners passed the ordinance on a 4-1 vote Thursday
on the advice of County Attorney William Buztrey, after Christian
fundamentalists and a group called Citizens Against Pornography
asked for the ban.
   Opponents objected to the film's humanizing of Christ,
particularly a scene in which he has a sexual fantasy involving
Mary Magdalene.
   Buztrey argued against the injunction, contending the film was
pornographic and patently offensive to the majority of citizens in
the county.
   ``It may be acceptable in Los Angeles, New York or Tampa, but it
isn't acceptable in Escambia County,'' he said.
   But Vinson listened to a tape recording of the emergency meeting
and said he heard no arguments concerning either obscenity or
violence.
   The only argument made by commissioners or citizens who spoke at
the meeting was that the film was sacreligious.
   Gregg Thomas, a lawyer representing the director and theater
company, cited rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court that it is not the
business of government to suppress real or imagined attacks on a
particular religion.
   Vinson agreed the case was virtually identical to ones in which
the high court has disallowed prior restraint of free speech or
expression.

   President Daniel Ortega said his
government is willing to meet in Guatemala with Contra rebels to
discuss resuming high-level peace talks aimed at ending the civil
war.
   Ortega said Friday that Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo
Tinoco would go to Guatemala ``to discuss with a Contra delegation
a next meeting in Managua and to hear their concerns (and) fears
are about coming to Managua.''
   The president said in a speech that the preliminary talks should
take place Sept. 19-20 in Guatemala City.
   ``I would like to have the cable in my hand before I reply. I
came from Washington yesterday, this is the first news I have,''
Nicaraguan Resistance director Alfredo Cesar said from his home in
Miami today.
   A cease-fire in the 7-year-old civil war between the U.S.-backed
rebels and the leftist Sandinistas began March 21. But high-level
negotiations in Managua on a permanent truce broke down on June 9.
   Contra leaders claimed the Sandinistas restricted their freedom
of movement in Managua and said future talks must be held in
another Central American country.
   The government has extended the cease-fire on a monthly basis,
most recently to Sept. 30. The rebels say they will abide by the
truce indefinitely, but each side has accused the other of
violations.
   Ortega said he suggested the preliminary talks in conversations
with Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Ortega also said conditions existed for a new summit of Central
American presidents in El Salvador to evaluate progress in
implementing a regional peace plan signed by the leaders in August
1987. The leaders of Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras and
El Salvador last met in January.
   The presidents would ``make decisions on the next steps that can
be taken to strengthen this process,'' Ortega said, adding that he
spoke by telephone with Cerezo and Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias about such a summit meeting.
   The peace plan calls for democracy in the five countries,
negotiated solutions to civil conflicts and political amnesties.
   Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the plan.

<TEXT>
   The scion of a wealthy Indian family
made aviation history today when he finished a 6,000-mile journey
from Britain to New Delhi in an ultralight aircraft in 23 days.
   Vijaypat Singhania landed in his red and white L'Esprit d'Indian
Post to loud applause at New Delhi's Safdarjung airport around noon.
   ``I wanted to be an ambassador for my country and show people
India is not just a country of snake-charmers,'' he said. ``I was
running out of stories to tell my grandchildren. Now I have a fund
of tales.''
   The 49-year-old millionaire, head of India's third largest
business concern, faced high winds, sandstorms in the Sahara desert
and hundreds of miles of open sea sitting for hours inside the
cramped one-seat cockpit.
   Singhania beat a 34-day ultralight record set earlier this year
by a British television journalist, Brian Milton. Singhania
finished the journey in 23 days, having left Biggin Hill, Britain
on August 18.
   The plane weighs 330 pounds, the weight of a medium-sized
motor-scooter, or, as Singhania said, ``the weight of an average
couple.''
   ``It belongs to the lightest possible category of aircraft,''
Aditya Dev, a pilot with Indian Airlines, said.
   The name of the aircraft, Singhania said, was a combination of
his ``two passions,'' the spirit of adventure and a Bombay-based
daily newspaper owned by his family, The Indian Post.
   ``There have been only five long flights (above 5,000 miles)
undertaken in a microlight aircraft,'' said Milton, who was at the
airport to congratulate Singhania. ``Anyone who now attempts such a
flight will have to beat Vijay to make the record.''
   As he emerged from the 21-feet long aircraft waving a cap,
Singhania was mobbed by hundreds of people who had gathered at the
central Delhi airport. After being garlanded with flowers in a
ritual of welcome, he was taken to a dais, presented mementos and
praised for having ``done India proud.''
   At a news conference later he described what had made him
undertake the journey that was, by his own admission, gruelling.
``I lost more than 11 kilograms (24 pounds) during the trip and
have got countless heat sores from sitting cramped in the cockpit
so long.''
   ``Flying at 10,000 feet over the Mediterranean, my longest
single non-stop spell of flying, I saw ships and tried to visualize
how long it would take for them to pick me up if I fell in,''
Singhania said.
   ``I had a life-jacket strapped on, shark-repellent by my side
and kept talking to my granddaughter's picture that was strapped to
the front of the cockpit to prevent myself from going crazy.''
   ``I kept my spirits up but let me tell you I was most relieved
to see the shore at Alexandria,'' he said of the most arduous
portion of the flight.
   ``My most thrilling moment was this morning, when I landed at
Delhi. I knew I had come to the end of the journey and that I had
established the record.''
   But the aviator did not seem ready to go on to further flying
successes.
   ``I want to sleep for four straight days before I even think of
flying again,'' he said. ``I never plan to repeat the feat.''

   A time bomb exploded in a crowded
bazaar of this frontier city today, and a military officer said 17
people were injured.
   The bomb was attached to a drinking water tank in the city's
main shopping area, said an army explosives expert, Maj. Ghulam
Hussain. It went off around 1:15 p.m, shattering windows, damaging
two cars and shaking central Peshawar.
   The Khyber bazaar is a grimy, cinderblock warren of merchants
and a main transit point for buses, taxis and three-wheeled
rickshaws.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blast, but officials
have routinely blamed such acts on agents of neighboring
Afghanistan's communist government.
   Pakistan supports Moslem guerrillas fighting the Kabul
government and an estimated 50,000 Soviet troops who support it.
Under a U.N.-sponsored accord, all Soviet troops are to have left
Afghanistan by Feb. 15.

   An unmanned Soviet supply ship bound for the
orbiting Mir space station was launched today, the Tass news agency
said.
   The brief dispatch said the spaceship Progress-38 was launched
at 3:34 a.m. carrying ``expendable materials and various loads to
the Mir piloted complex.'' Tass gave no other details of the
spacecraft's contents.
   The complex is manned by cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa
Manarov, who are trying to break a 326-day endurance record set in
December by Yuri Romanenko. Cosmonauts aboard the Mir have received
cargo deliveries of food, fuel and mail every few months.
   Tass did not say when the spacecraft was expected to dock with
the orbiting laboratory.
   Earlier this week, equipment problems and human error delayed by
one day the return of two cosmonauts who had spent a few days at
the Mir station.

   Hurricane Florence lashed the Gulf Coast with
80 mph winds and sheets of rain, trapping four men on a barge and
forcing thousands of people to head inland for safety, but quickly
weakened to a tropical depression.
   ``It was a small storm, but I don't care for any of them,'' said
Luke Petrovich, president of Plaquemines Parish on the tip of the
Mississippi Delta.
   One death was linked to the storm, an Alabama man who drowned
Friday as he tried to secure a boat against the rising winds. But
property damage was less than expected.
   The eye of the hurricane, about 30 miles wide, passed 30 miles
east of New Orleans around 3 a.m., then headed across Lake
Pontchartrain, slightly west of the predicted path over the city of
Slidell.
   Two hours later, the highest sustained winds were clocked at 60
mph, and Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm. By 5:30 a.m.,
the poorly defined remnants of the storm were just north of
Hammond, moving toward Mississippi.
   At 8 a.m., the National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence to
a tropical depression and discontinued all warnings, although it
advised small craft to stay in port from Morgan City, La., to
Apalachicola.
   Evacuation orders for Louisiana were lifted, allowing people to
return home despite some high water.
   ``We're still watching the tides, particularly from the west,
but we don't think they will come up high enough to cause a
problem,'' Petrovich said.
   Winds trailing the storm were expected to drive tides in the
marshy regions around New Orleans as much as 9 feet above normal.
   The threat of tornadoes remained. Tornado watches were posted
along the Gulf Coast from New Orleans east to Pensacola, Fla.
   There were widespread power failures, including metropolitan New
Orleans, where about 30,000 people lost electricity. Power was
knocked out to 7,000 people in Plaquemeines Parish, Petrovich said.
   There were no reports of major damage.
   At Orange Beach, Ala., a 32-year-old man who didn't know how to
swim drowned Friday when he fell into Cotton Bayou as he tried to
tie down a boat in wind and rain, said police Cpl. Marvin Glass.
   Four men were stranded at the mouth of the Mississippi River,
each on separate barges used in the offshore oil industry. They
were trapped when the weather became too rough for the Coast Guard
to rescue them.
   ``They just rode it out,'' Petty Officer Steve Guy said this
morning. A rescue center maintained hourly contact with the men.
   In St. Bernard Parish just east of New Orleans, the storm
hampered efforts to fight three major house fires, said civil
defense official Bob Bracamontes.
   ``It's rough,'' Bracamontes said. ``These firemen out there now
have a rough time trying to pull those hoses in this wind.''
   Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer was to return today after cutting
short a trip to Taiwan a day early. Louisiana Lt. Gov. Paul Hardy
and Mississippi Lt. Gov. Brad Dye, whose boss Ray Mabus traveled
with Roemer, declared emergencies in parts of their states and put
their National Guards on alert.
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt declared a statewide emergency Friday.
Alabama Emergency Management Director J. Danny Cooper said the
declaration would allow officials to cope with the potential side
effects of the hurricane, including the need for public shelters
and the possibility of tornadoes and flash floods.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis indefinitely
postponed an outdoor rally Friday in New Orleans as well as two
indoor fund-raisers _ a $1,000-per-couple cocktail party and a
$10,000-per-couple buffet.
   All along the coast, residents taped up windows and boarded up
homes before fleeing to evacuation centers.
   ``It seems like you have to leave every time you turn around.
We're evacuees,'' said Joe Gonzales, 66, of Delacroix Island. ``You
know you're leaving home and you might not have a home to come back
to.''
   Others stocked up on water, canned goods and batteries to wait
out the storm at home.
   ``Once you make up your mind to stay, all you can do is stay,''
said Curtis Mallon, a Dauphin Island, Ala., resident.
   As many as 10,000 Mississippians headed for higher ground at
evacuation centers or homes of friends or relatives, including some
tropical storm novices.
   ``It's all going to be quite an experience,'' said Charlotte
Cirec of Gulfport, Miss., who moved from Las Vegas two years ago.
   In Florida and Louisiana, military planes were flown inland or
moved into hangars. The USS Lexington, a training aircraft carrier
based at Pensacola Naval Air Station, set out to the safety of open
sea.
   Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm
season, is the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimal
hurricane strength briefly before hitting Mexican coast last month.
   Florence hit land on the 23rd anniversary of Hurricane Betsy,
which spilled its storm surge over levees and flooded eastern New
Orleans, killing 70 people in Louisiana and causing $1.1 billion in
damage.
   In the Caribbean early today, Tropical Storm Gilberto formed
about 250 miles south-southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, or at
latitude 15.1 north, longitude 64.2 west. Gilberto, packing winds
of 40 mph, was moving to the west at near 15 mph.

<TEXT>
   Insurgents belonging to an outlawed
tribal group in the eastern state of Tripura surrendered arms today
after reaching a peace agreement with the government, the United
News of India reported.
   An unknown number of Tribal National Volunteers, the insurgent
group, gave the weapons to army officers at a village near the
India-Bangladesh border.
   The surrender follows a negotiated settlement Aug. 12 by the
Tripura state governement and the federal government with the
insurgents. The rebel group has been fighting for a separate state
for the past decade and has been blamed for the killing of at least
600 non-tribal settlers in the region.
   The problem started in 1951 with the steady influx of settlers
from Bangladesh and other parts of India into Tripura.
   The economic and social patterns in the state began shifting.
Soon the tribals who had originally settled the area were
outnumbered.
   In the 1970s, tribal unrest gave rise to the Tribal National
Volunteers, which declared ``independent Tripura'' as its objective
and took up arms.
   Under the August agreement, the insurgents agreed to give up
arms in exchange for 20 seats in the new state legislature.

<HEAD>Two `Stern Group' Members Admit They Helped Kill Bernadotte</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two former members of a militant Jewish group
which was led by the now-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir admitted
they helped kill a Swedish U.N. envoy to Palestine 40 years ago, an
Israeli journalist said today.
   It was the first time that members of the underground group,
Lohamei Herut Yisrael (Israel Freedom Fighters), also widely known
as the ``Stern Group,'' confessed to the 1948 killing of Count
Folke Bernadotte, said Dan Margalit of Israel's state-run
Educational Television.
   Margalit told The Associated Press his information was based on
interviews he conducted with Yehoshua Zetler and Meshulam Makover,
two of Bernadotte's killers. One of the interviews was shown Friday
on Educational TV.
   The radical Lohamei Herut Yisrael group, headed by Avraham
Stern, was a splinter faction of the more mainstream group Irgun
Zvai Leumi (The National Military Organization). The faction
advocated guerrilla rebellion against British rule in mandate
Palestine.
   In 1942, Stern was shot and killed by the British police, and
Lohamei Herut Yisrael devised a three-man leadership of Shamir,
Yisrael Scheib-Eldad and Natan Yellin-Mor, with Eldad serving as
the group's ideologist.
   Margalit quoted Zetler as saying he decided to kill Bernadotte,
President of the Swedish Red Cross during and after the World War
II, after the envoy raised far-reaching Palestine partition ideas.
   Bernadotte was appointed in May 1948 to negotiate a cease-fire
and recommend a settlement in Israel's 1948 War of Independence.
   ``Zetler said he conferred with Eldad, and the two traveled to
Haifa to discuss it with Yellin-Mor. Yellin-Mor demanded that after
the killing, the Lohamei Herut Yisrael deny its role and blame the
slaying on a tiny group of zealots called The Homeland Front,''
Margalit said.
   Zetler returned to Jerusalem and selected three men to join him
and Makover on the mission: the late Yehoshua Cohen, Ben Moshe and
another man, ``who is still alive but refuses to disclose his
identity,'' Margalit said. ``They call him (the fifth man) the
Gingi, or the red-haired one,'' Margalit said.
   Margalit quoted Makover as saying the guerrillas arrived in two
cars to the spot selected by Zetler for the Sept. 17, 1948, killing
in downtown Jerusalem. Zetler was driving a De Soto car and the
four others were in a jeep, dressed in khaki shorts and peaked caps
of the Jewish army.
   ``There was also an Australian journalist who told the group
when Bernadotte's convoy was due to pass,'' Margalit said without
elaboration.
   He quoted Makover as saying that when Bernadotte's three-car
convoy approached the narrow street, the jeep blocked its way and
three guerrillas jumped outside, with Makover staying behind the
wheel.
   ``They were supposed to find Bernadotte's vehicle. Each one
looked inside a car, and in the last vehicle, Cohen saw the
envoy,'' Margalit quoted Makover as saying. ``Cohen thrust the
muzzle of his machine-gun inside, fired and wounded a French U.N.
officer.''
   ``He then backed up two steps, took a careful aim, fired into
the car and killed Bernadotte.''
   Makover told Margalit he ordered the two other guerrillas,
``Gingi'' and Moshe, to fire at the tires of the remaining cars.
When it was done, ``they jumped into the jeep and escaped,''
Margalit quoted Makover as saying.
   The killing was widely blamed on the Lohamei Herut Yisrael
group, and the Israeli government launched a nation-wide hunt for
its members, arresting 400 people, among them Yellin-Mor. But the
killers were never found.

<HEAD>City Proposes $3.5 Million Settlement For Motorist Beaten By
Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motorist who suffered severe brain damage when
he was beaten and thrown down a flight of stairs by two Chicago
police officers will get $3.5 million from the city under a
tentative settlement, officials said.
   The settlement would be the largest in a police case in the
city's history, said Deputy Corporation Counsel Matthew Piers.
Piers testified Friday before a City Council committee, which
unanimously urged the full council to approve the settlement.
   The ``spectacularly severe injuries'' suffered by the victim,
Rafael Acosta, 43, in the May 1981 incident prompted city lawyers
to reach the settlement with Acosta's lawyers, Piers told the
committee.
   ``This is the most egregious case of police brutality I have
ever heard of,'' said Alderman Edward Burke, a former officer.
``Give these poor folks the money they are certainly entitled to.
This is outrageous.''
   The incident began when the two officers saw Acosta, a former
hotel waiter, make an illegal turn in traffic, officials said.
   The officers, Julio Lucotti and Steven Chirello, followed the
victim to his West Side apartment building and beat him severely
before throwing him down a 17-step flight of stairs, Piers told the
committee.
   Among the witnesses to the attack were Acosta's wife and two of
his children.
   The officers, who were never disciplined and are still on duty,
said Acosta fought with them and then fell down the staircase while
handcuffed.
   Acosta suffered permanent brain damage and has been at Elgin
State Hospital, a mental institution, for the past five years.
Piers said Acosta has undergone drastic personality changes
evidenced by a suicide attempt, physical and sexual assaults on
strangers, and frequent violent outbursts at the hospital.
   The Police Department's Office of Professional Standards made no
finding of excessive use of force by the officers and Cook County
State's Attorney Richard Daley declined to prosecute, Piers said.
   ``OPS is like a big washing machine,'' Alderman Anna Langford
said. ``Everything goes in dirty and comes out clean. We had better
take this settlement and run.''

   A janitor who convinced thousands he
had won the nation's largest Lotto jackpot has been arrested and
charged with two felony fraud counts, the Florida Lottery
Department said.
   Lottery security agents arrested Charles Hill at his home in
Bristol on Friday and booked him into the Leon County Jail in
Tallahassee.
   Hill, a father of five who earns $14,000 a year as a janitor at
Bristol Elementary School, claimed to have the winning ticket in
the Sept. 3 Lotto drawing that was worth $55.1 million.
   Liberty County sheriff's deputies were sent to guard Hill's home
Monday after he made his claim.
   Liberty County Sheriff Harrell Revell said he felt Hill might
need security, even though he stressed then that the man's Lotto
ticket had not been verified yet.
   And in spite of that lack of confirmation, Hill was able to buy
two customized vans, worth a total of $42,000, from two different
dealers, with no money down.
   But the lottery announced Wednesday that Sheelah Ryan, 63, a
real estate broker from Winter Springs, had won the $55.1 million
jackpot.
   The customized vans were returned.
   Hill was charged with knowingly presenting a counterfeit or
altered state lottery ticket and falsely making, altering, forging,
passing or counterfeiting a state lottery ticket with intent to
defraud.
   Lottery officials did not answer their phones after issuing a
news release saying they had arrested Hill. The release did not say
what penalties Hill could face if convicted. There also was no
answer at the office of State Attorney Willie Meggs, whose office
assisted lottery security police in the investigation.

   A silver- and gold-plated toothbrush

block in October with a minimum asking price of $25,900, Munich
auction house officials said Saturday.
   The auction house Hermann Historica said the toothbrush and
other period artifacts would be sold on Oct. 14 and 15.
   Auction house officials said the toothbrush, which is also
decorated with Napoleon's coat of arms, came from the estate of a
British officer who found it after the battle of Waterloo in 1815.
   The Waterloo campaign crushed Napoleon's rule and forced him to
abdicate for a second time.
   The auction house statement said one of three death masks of
Napoleon still in existence will also be sold for a minimum asking
price of $9,459.

   Eritrean rebels said they sank three ships
and damaged port installations in speedboat attacks along
Ethiopia's Red Sea coast.
   The rebels made the claim Friday in a radio broadcast over the
clandestine Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea that was monitored
in Nairobi.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said rebel naval units
carried out the attack Tuesday on the Red Sea port of Massawa, 40
miles northeast of Eritrea's provincial capital Asmara.
   Ethiopia's government in the capital, Addis Ababa, rarely
comments on rebel claims and, there was no way to independently
confirm Friday's report.
   Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province, is home to Africa's
longest civil war, a 27-year-old secessionist struggle. In
neighboring Tigre, rebels have been fighting for 14 years for
greater autonomy for that region.

   Up to 50 million people will pound the boulevards,
main streets and mud tracks of the world Sunday in the second Sport
Aid ``Race Against Time'' to raise funds for starving children,
organizers say.
   Billed as the biggest participation event in history, the
six-mile road runs will begin in searing heat or torch-lit
darkness, at speed or at a casual pace, when starting pistols fire
simultaneously in 128 countries at 11 a.m. EDT.
   From remote island outposts to the crowded streets of London,
New York, Moscow and Hong Kong, young and old will don ``I Changed
the World'' T-shirts for an enlarged rerun of Sport Aid '86.
   Organizer Nick Cater called it ``a petition of blistered feet''
to help poor countries ``do something for their children.''
   ``Our slogan is `Change the World','' he said. ``We hope to
inspire people to feel that they can make a very real difference to
the world they live in.''
   The race starts at dawn local time on Monday in the Pacific
island of Tonga, ``the land where time begins,'' and as the Sunday
evening sun sets over the Pyramids in Egypt, Cater said.
   All 58 residents in the South Pacific island of Pitcairn Island
have pledged to run, as have the majority of the 2,000 residents in
Norfolk Island off Australia.
   ``When you live on a small island you tend to become very
isolated from the rest of the world,'' said Tom Lloyd, editor of
the Norfolk Islander newspaper.
   ``Now we feel part of it. It's the biggest thing that's happened
on the island.''
   Two children from each participating country will formally kick
off the global event with a 1,000-yard run from New York's Fifth
Avenue to the steps of the United Nations headquarters.
   They will be accompanied by Omar Khalifa, a Sudanese athlete who
launched the May 25, 1986, race that raised more than $35 million
for African famine victims.
   Official runs have been organized in only 15 major American
cities, and Cater said ``the bigger nations of the world can be a
little insular.''
   ``We just wish we could reach out to all the people in the
(United) States,'' he said.
   The 1986 race, which attracted nearly 20 million runners in 89
countries, flopped in the United States because it coincided with a
nationwide ``Hands Across America'' campaign to raise funds for the
poor.
   Sport Aid will be broadcast live in six languages to a potential
audience of 1.5 billion people through satellite TV and radio
link-ups to 23 cities. Coverage will include excerpts of carnivals
and concerts from Trinidad to Dubai to Rio de Janeiro.
   Pope John Paul II will relay a special message of support during
his visit to Zimbabwe.
   Money raised from runners' sponsors, ticket sales to the races
and from sideline events will go to charities in mainly
underdeveloped nations. One-fifth of funds raised in each developed
country will go to poor and disabled children in that country.
   The United Nations Children's Fund estimates that nearly 15
million children die each year from hunger and easily preventable
diseases.
   By Saturday, 26 million people had signed up to run, but London
officials of Sport Aid said they expect as many as 50 million when
the starting pistols are fired.
   Sport Aid said Zambia's President Kenneth Kuanda will start the
race in the capital city of Lusaka. Iceland's President Vigdis
Finbogadott, Mauritius' First Lady, Lady Sugnautah, and Brazilian
soccer star Pele will put on their running shoes and participate in
their country's runs.
   Other locally organized fund-raising events include a
cross-country ski event by British army marines in the South
Atlantic island of South Georgia, and runs by passengers aboard the
luxury ocean liner Canberra in the Mediterranean and by oil workers
aboard tankers in the Gulf of Oman.
   In China, where 2.3 million runners have signed up, doctors will
hold special roadside clinics and donate their fees to help
inoculation and other medical programs.
   Sudan has organized a run alongside the flood-swollen Nile River
in Khartoum, but Bangladesh, also devastated by floods, has
postponed its race, Cater said.
   In Malaysia, government ministers will join a relay race in
Kuala Lumpur. Free-fall army parachutists will herald the start of
the race in Oman by descending into Muscat's Sultan Qaboos Stadium.
   In the United Arab Emirates, a massive 11-tier Sport Aid cake
weighing 440 pounds was officially cut in Dubai and an official
Sport Aid torch was moved by helicopter from Abu Dhabi to Dubai.
About 2,000 people were expected to run Sunday.
   Cater urged ``everybody on Sunday to do anything they can to
help, whether it's just going out and giving money to a local
children's charity. Let's do something for the kids of the world.''

   The struggle for democracy in Burma is
threatening the nation's food supply, causing shortages of gasoline
and increasing prices of fruits and vegetables, diplomats said
Saturday.
   Western diplomatic personnel interviewed here said shortages of
food and other supplies were widespread in Rangoon, Burma's
capital. Even the exclusive Rangoon store at which diplomats shop
has run out of rice, they said.
   Diplomats are among the only residents who can still tap the
virtually exhausted fuel supply. Many Burmese have had to walk up
to 15 miles to take part in anti-government demonstrations, they
said.
   The demonstrations prompted the government Saturday to end 26
years of single-party rule and announce that general elections will
be held under a multiparty system.
   Embassies and foreign organizations sent more than 230
dependents and non-essential staffers to Bangkok Friday on a
special Thai Airways flight, leaving about 400 others awaiting
evacuation.
   Diplomats said the evacuees included Americans, Australians,
Filipinos, Malaysians, Indonesians, British, Japanese, South
Koreans, Soviets and Thais.
   Despite widespread looting and increasing violence in the
Burmese capital, the diplomats insisted they were evacuated
strictly as a precautionary measure and said they hope to return
soon.
   ``The diplomatic store is supposed to have rice, but it has not
had it for a week or so,'' said one diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Diplomatic personnel ``have the same
shortages as everyone else. We get fresh food at the markets but in
limited supplies. And it has become very expensive.
   ``We (diplomats) are in the happy position of having freezers,
and everyone has been gobbling up the food in their freezers
because they are afraid the electricity will go off.''
   The food shortage has occurred mainly because strikes and a fuel
shortage have made it very difficult to get commodities into the
capital. But the diplomat said hoarding is also to blame.
   Indeed, other diplomats have said the military has been hoarding
goods in an attempt to starve the people into submission.
   Another Western diplomat, also speaking anonymously, said a
small bag of rice in Rangoon was selling for 600 kyats ($100),
``and the average person makes less than 400 kyats ($67) a month.
Vegetables and fruit are still around, but the prices have gone up
a lot.''
   A lack of gasoline has kept most buses from operating, ``so a
lot of people have to walk,'' the diplomat said.
   ``Thousands of people had to walk 15 miles or more to get into
town (for a pro-democracy rally Friday),'' she said. ``They passed
our (diplomatic) compound for more than an hour. Then they had to
walk home again.
   ``You see almost no cars except for (those owned by)
diplomats,'' she added. The few buses running ``are packed. You see
25 people sitting on the top of them. A lot of people are not going
to work because of the transportation problem.''
   Both diplomats said the foreign community had no fear of the
massive crowds that have rallied in Rangoon almost daily for
several weeks to press for an end to one-party rule and an interim
government to lead the country to democracy. But the crowds have
made it difficult to move about.
   ``There are a million out walking but they are gentle,
good-natured,'' the first diplomat said. ``There are reports that
youngsters have been attacked by military intelligence people, but
they (soldiers) are not interested in foreigners.
   ``There have been such huge crowds that if you wanted to get
from one side of the city to the other you had to wait for an hour
and a half'' for the protesters to pass, the diplomat said. ``Then
you go one block and they are snaking back again.
   ``During the day everything is OK. But at night there are a lot
of robbers and looters out and it is not safe.''

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ On the 15th anniversary of the bloody coup
that installed him ``only for as long as circumstances demand,''
President Gen. Augusto Pinochet is eagerly pursuing a new
eight-year mandate.
   He remains firmly in control of the military. But an
increasingly unified and confident opposition predicts his
political demise before the anniversary rolls around again next
year.
   Commander of the country's fiercely disciplined army, Pinochet
led the Sept. 11, 1973, coup that toppled the elected government of
a Marxist, Salvador Allende, during a period of widespread social
and economic upheaval.
   That same day, the armed forces solemnly announced by radio that
they were ``assuming power only for as long as circumstances demand
it.'' The statement was interpreted by most Chileans that a return
to the long tradition of democratic rule would be swift.
   Instead, a decade and a half later, Pinochet has launched a huge
campaign to persuade his countrymen that circumstances demand he
remain in power until 1997 and that they they must vote accordingly
in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum.
   In a clear demonstration that his military power base remains
strong, Pinochet recently won the quick and unanimous backing of
his fellow armed forces commanders for his sole candidacy in the
referendum.
   The 72-year-old general had been campaigning hard for the
nomination and had behind him the fervent backing of the army, by
far the most powerful military branch.
   If he wins the referendum, he will begin a new eight-year term
next March 11. If he loses, he remains in power another year until
an open election is called and will hand power over to the winner
in March 1990.
   Whether he wins or loses, a Congress will be elected in 1990 for
the first time since it was disbanded at the time of the coup. But
the legislature will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980
constitution, crafted by Pinochet's administration, that gives the
military autonomy and a strong supervisory role in national affairs.
   Most polls how Pinochet lacking sufficient voter support. In an
evident bid to increase his popularity, he has been easing
political restrictions and cultivating a new, conciliatory image
that contrasts with his harshly authoritarian reputation.
   He decreed an end to states of emergency in effect since he took
power and lifted a ban on the return of all leftists in exile. Many
of them were expelled or fled during a wave of fierce repression
that followed the coup.
   ``Let's bury in forgetfulness that which keeps us apart,''
Pinochet declared to critics in an ``open letter'' published by
Santiago newspapers last week.
   In speech after speech, he maintains that Chile needs his strong
leadership to wrap up reforms that will produce a new democracy,
with effective safeguards against international Marxism and a
strong-free market economy.
   A saturation campaign of pro-government advertisements on
television, radio and in the press contends that his defeat would
mean a return to the political and social chaos of the Allende
years. It protrays his leading critics as politically bankrupt,
quarrelsome hacks intent on personal gain.
   But after years of deep division, 16 opposition parties ranging
from center-right to far left have united in an unusually coherent
effort to defeat Pinochet at the ballot box.
   The coalition, called the Command for the No Vote, has launched
its own low-budget but well organized campaign. Its advertisements
recall Pinochet's promises not to remain in power forever and
declare, ``No more lies.''
   Opposition leaders who once spent most of their time arguing now
appear together at anti-government rallies and forums, declaring
confidently that Pinochet's days are numbered. A Sept. 4 rally
attracted more than 100,000 people in what organizers called the
biggest anti-government demonstration since the coup.
   They also have agreed on a general political platform that
promises greater emphasis on social benefits but no revolutionary
economic or political changes. If Pinochet loses the referendum,
they plan negotiations with the armed forces to speed up his
departure, amend the constitution and hold quick elections for a
four-year transition government.
   Genero Arrigiada, a centrist Christian Democrat who is
secretary-general of the coalition, said the opposition's new unity
is the result of a long and painful maturing process.
   He said party leaders now realize that their own infighting
allowed Pinochet to seize power and to retain it.
   ``Just as Sept. 11 (1973) was the culmination of a deep
political division, this campaign is the expression of just the
opposite,'' he said. ``It's the end of the war between the
parties.''
   Asked if he expected Pinochet to still be in power next Sept.
11, he replied: ``No. This is the last one.''

<HEAD>Minister Says Tutu Manipulated By Radicals; Afrikaners To Meet
With ANC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The law and order minister
described Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Saturday as a ``tragic and
misled person'' who is challenging the government on the orders of
revolutionaries.
   Also Saturday, a newspaper reported that prominent Afrikaner
politicians and academics, including the brother of a Cabinet
minister, will meet next month with Soviet policymakers and black
nationalist guerrilla leaders.
   Adriaan Vlok, the law and order minister, said revolutionaries
have decided that Tutu, leader of the Anglican church in southern
Africa, should ``create incidents'' to embarrass South Africa
during the U.S. presidential campaign and the current visit to the
region by Pope John Paul II.
   Vlok, who oversees the national police force, was reacting to
Tutu's recent defiance of an emergency regulation forbidding calls
for an election boycott.
   Three times in the past week, Tutu has urged blacks and whites
to boycott next month's municipal elections, which many blacks view
as an entrenchment of segregated, white-controlled political
structures.
   Police are investigating Tutu's statements to determine whether
he should be prosecuted.
   Vlok, in a speech reported by the state-run South African
Broadcasting Corp., said ``naive church leaders'' are being misused
by the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement and
South African Communist Party.
   Vlok said Tutu, out of personal ambition, is playing a key role
in a campaign to ``bring the country to its knees.''
   The Argus, a Cape Town daily, said 18 white South Africans will
travel to Munich, West Germany, in late October for a six-day
conference.
   They will meet with officials of the African National Congress
guerrilla movement and with a Soviet delegation that will include
at least two deputy directors of the African Institute of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences, it said.
   South African authorities have discouraged contacts with the
African National Congress. The organization is outlawed in South
Africa and wages a bombing and sabotage campaign to undermine the
Afrikaner-dominated government.
   According to The Argus, the delegation heading to Munich will
include Willem de Klerk, a former newspaper editor whose brother,
Frederik de Klerk, is minister of education and a possible
candidate to succeed President P.W. Botha.
   Others in the group reportedly will include Wynand Malan, a
Parliament member who heads the small, anti-apartheid National
Democratic Movement, and Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, former leader
of the liberal Progressive Federal Party. Malan and Slabbert have
met with ANC officials previously.
   Afrikaners, descended from Dutch and other northern European
settlers, make up about 60 percent of South Africa's 5 million
whites.
   Many Afrikaners have broken with Botha's National Party in
recent years, some to the left because of disenchantment with
apartheid, and a far larger number to the right to protest what
they perceive as concessions to blacks.
   Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The white minority controls the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Except for choosing texts and shaping the
curriculum, most teachers feel left out of critical decisions
affecting classroom life, according to a nationwide poll released
Saturday.
   Ten percent or fewer of 21,698 public school teachers surveyed
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancment of Teaching felt they
had any say in issues like teacher evaluation or selection of new
teachers and administrators. Just 20 percent believed they were
influential in tailoring school budgets.
   ``The report endorses what I have often said _ that teachers are
treated like very tall children instead of professionals,'' said
Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teacher union with 1.9 million
members.
   On the positive side, 79 percent of those surveyed said they
felt involved in choosing textbooks and instructional materials,
and 63 percent said they had a say in shaping the curriculum.
   A report on the results, ``Teacher Involvement in
Decisionmaking: A State-by-State Profile,'' revealed wide
disparities in the degree of involvement teachers felt in different
states.
   In Vermont, for example, 93 percent of teachers reported a high
level of involvement in choosing textbooks, 85 percent said they
helped shape the curriculum, and 50 percent said they were involved
in setting student promotion policies.
   But only 63 percent of Louisiana teachers said they helped
choose texts, 40 percent said they were involved in shaping the
curriculum, 36 percent had a say in tracking students into special
classes, and just 1 percent felt they had influence in selecting
new teachers.
   ``The evidence shows that in many matters that are important to
building a good school, teachers have not been very much
involved,'' foundation president Ernest L. Boyer said in an
interview.
   Boyer said school reformers must find a middle ground, a way to
involve teachers while maintaining a sensible monitoring and
support role for state education officials.
   ``America's school reform movement is at a crossroads,'' he said
in a forward to the report. ``During the past five years, academic
requirements have been tightened, standards have been raised, but
most of the mandates for reform have been imposed top-down, and
we're beginning to discover that outside regulation has its
limits.''
   The 50-state teacher survey was conducted by mail in the spring
of 1987 by the Wirthlin Group, a polling organization in McLean,
Va. The poll had a margin of error of less than plus or minus 1
percent for nationwide findings.
   Among other results:
   _47 percent of all surveyed said they felt involved in setting
standards of student conduct. The range was 68 percent among Oregon
teachers to 37 percent in Florida, New Jersey and Rhode Island.
   _45 percent reported having influence in tracking students into
special classes. The high was Minnesota at 63 percent; Louisiana
was the lowest at 36 percent.
   _43 percent said they had a say in designing programs for staff
development. Oklahoma was highest at 82 percent; Rhode Island was
lowest at 30 percent.
   _34 percent said they influenced policies governing which
students were promoted or held back. Vermont teachers reported the
most involvement at 50 percent, Florida the least at 21 percent.
   _20 percent said they influenced the school budget. Hawaii
teachers had a 57 percent positive response, while the low was 8
percent in North Dakota.
   _10 percent felt involved in evaluating teacher performance.
Georgia and Utah led with 20 percent, while Florida, Nevada, New
Jersey and Rhode Island were tied at 6 percent.
   _7 percent said they had a hand in selecting new teachers.
Colorado, New Hampshire and Oregon tied at 20 percent, and
Louisiana teachers reported the least involvement at 1 percent.
   _7 percent felt involved in picking new administrators. Vermont
had the highest positive response at 20 percent, Nevada the lowest
at 1 percent.

<TEXT>
   President Maung Maung said Burma's ruling
party decided today to end 26 years of single-party rule and to
hold a general election under a multiparty system.
   The decision was a victory for opposition leaders and for
hundreds of thousands of Burmese who have taken to the streets in
sometimes violent demonstrations that have toppled two presidents
in three months.
   Speaking before 968 delegates at a special party congress, the
president admitted that major errors were commmitted by the party
and said the interests of the people were paramount.
   ``Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,'' he
said in a speech carried by the state-owned Radio Rangoon. He
pledged a free and fair general election will be held as soon as
possible but gave no date.
   The broadcast announcer said the decision was unanimously
adopted by the delegates of the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Maung Maung said a party emergency session of Parliament on
Sunday will make necessary amendments to the constitution to adopt
the multiparty system and also to form an independent commission to
supervise the elections.
   He urged government employes, who have left their jobs in
sympathy with the pro-democracy movement, to return to their jobs
so the government can function.
   The special party congress was originally scheduled for Monday
to decide whether a referendum on one-party rule would be called.
Radio Rangoon said the delegates today decided to scrap the
referendum idea and to go ahead with elections under a multiparty
system.
   Today's announcement came one day after former Prime Minister U
Nu, toppled in a 1962 military coup, announced the formation of a
rival government to take power from Maung Maung. It was not
immediately clear how today's development would affect U Nu's plan,
which was not supported by all opposition figures.
   Also Friday, about 500 renegade soldiers joined protesters
demanding formation of an interim government and full democracy. It
was the first major defection of troops to the opposition.
   The moves followed weeks of massive, occasionally bloody turmoil
in this isolated Southeast Asian nation that left dozens of people
dead. Unofficial reports said the death toll could be in the
hundreds from street riots that broke out in July.
   In a letter to embassies on Friday, 82-year-old U Nu called for
general elections Oct. 9. He announced a Cabinet with himself as
prime minister, former President Mahn Win Maung as president and
retired Gen. Tin Oo, a vocal critic of the current authoritarian
leadership, as defense minister.
   However, Tin Oo and two other members of the rival Cabinet _
retired military commanders Aung Shwe and Saw Myint _ resigned
today, and reliable sources said U Nu had not consulted them about
his move. The Bar Council of Burma said students and other
opposition groups also had not been consulted.
   The three men also said in a statement that they were resigning
from a League for Democracy and Peace that U Nu had formed earlier
to oppose the Maung Maung's government.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, an opposition figure and daughter of slain
independence leader Aung San, told reporters the announcement of a
multiparty system was ``a positive step,'' but said it could take
up to two years to form parties to contest in general elections.
   ``Under the present economic and political situation, an interim
government will be the best solution. It (the interim government)
would deal with economic problems and also hold general
elections,'' she told reporters.
   Another opposition leader, retired Gen. Aung Gyi, said he
doubted ``the prevailing situation will permit holding of general
elections under the present government.''
   Toru Ohno, a Japanese Burma specialist at Osaka University, said:
   ``The fact that the ruling party took action two days ahead of
its original schedule ... means that Maung Maung's government can
no longer control or suppress protest. I'm glad the party made the
compromise in an effort to seek a peaceful and democratic
settlement.
   Ne Win led the 1962 coup that toppled U Nu. Ne Win resigned as
head of the ruling party in July, citing in part widespread street
protests in March and June. Riots flared when the party chose Sein
Lwin to succeed Ne Win. Sein Lwin is a hardliner widely hated for
his brutal suppression of dissidents.
   The government said 112 people died in anti-government
demonstrations, but diplomats estimated hundreds were killed.
   Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after 17 days in power, and Maung
Maung was named to replace him. Maung Maung was Burma's first
civilian leader in 26 years, but protests and nationwide strikes
continued as opponents demanded an immediate end to one-party rule.

   Postmaster General Anthony Frank wants to
bring America's generations closer together, and if that brings the
Post Office a little extra business he won't mind.
   ``Plant a Family Tree'' is the name of Frank's plan, in which
millions of family history forms will be given out, in hopes that
youngsters will write to their grandparents seeking information to
fill them out.
   ``Letters provide an important link between families.
Grandparents often meet their grandchildren through an exchange of
letters and photographs long before they see each other
face-to-face,'' Frank said.
   But it isn't just a business proposition, says Frank. He could
generate more business by concentrating on big advertisers and
catalog companies.
   ``The Postal Service is part of the fabric of American life. We
do more than deliver the mail. We deliver ideas and dreams and help
preserve our heritage,'' he says.
   As part of the family tree program the Postal Service has
printed millions of folders which discuss family histories on one
side and contain a genealogical form on the back to fill in
information on parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.
   The forms will be available, free, in post offices by the first
week in October.
   To get things started, Frank invited 27 third graders from Dale
City, Va., to his Washington office on Friday to hear about the
project and mail letters to their grandparents _ letters likely to
get special treatment, since they were handed directly to the
postmaster general.
   ``It's just finding out about a generation you don't have much
contact with,'' Frank said of his hopes for the program. It's
children asking: ``Tell me about yourself, gramps. Tell me about my
parents when they were my age.''
   ``What a compliment, to be asked about yourself by
grandchildren,'' Frank added, in an interview.
   Many youngsters will probably telephone for information, of
course. But, Frank noted nostalgically, ``You don't tie ribbons
around old phone calls in the attic.''
   In some countries, generations live together and get to know
each other, but that's not often the way in America. As a result
children tend not to know their grandparents very well, Frank
explained to the youngsters.
   ``We're running out of glue in this country. People are no
longer as family oriented. People are no longer as community
oriented ... This is a try to bring the family together,'' Frank
said.
   Victor Hurst of the 30-million member American Association of
Retired Persons hailed the program as a way of increasing harmony
among people from different generations.
   ``You can be sure our grandmothers and grandfathers will be as
excited as can be to help all the grandchildren around the nation
fill in the blanks in their family trees,'' Hurst said.
   Frank noted that only after becoming an adult do many people
realize what they missed if they were not close to grandparents.
And by that time it is often too late.
   In addition to providing a form for starting a family tree the
folder includes tips on pursuing a more detailed family background,
including suggested sources for genealogical information, such as
the Census, National Archives and National Genealogical Society.

   Opera star Placido Domingo wowed the fans
watching celebrities arrive for the glittering opening of San
Francisco's 66th formal opera season.
   ``I could have fainted dead away,'' said Dr. Lisa Snow of
Berkeley, as Domingo walked by wearing a tuxedo jacket over blue
jeans. ``He's so wonderful ... not stuck up at all.''
   Domingo starred with Shirley Verrett in a 3{-hour performance
Friday night of Meyerbeer's 19th century romance, ``L'Africaine.''
   The San Francisco Chronicle applauded the stars' passionate
performances, but questioned the ``improbable'' choice of the opera
for the opener. It is the story of the love of a presumed African
woman for Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama. At the end, she turns
out to be an East Indian queen.
   But for those unwilling to pay the opening night ticket prices,
ranging from standing room at $15 to $350 for a box seat, the show
was outside.
   Some 100 people _ including one who brought along a 10-foot
python for company _ lined the street outside the Opera House to
watch the arrival of men in black tie and tails and jeweled women
in $10,000 gowns.
   ``Isn't this an evening,'' marveled longtime first-nighter John
McGuire.
   Among those entering the Opera House were Gordon and Ann Getty,
heiress Patricia Hearst Shaw and designer Paloma Picasso.
   People who bought standing room tickets started lining up early
in the day.
   Ingrid Sumeri and seven friends among the standees marched into
the Opera Hall, across from City Hall, to party in the lobby before
the show.
   ``This is our third opening,'' she said. ``We always bring a
picnic and have dinner _ cold salmon, baklava, champagne, lots of
good things.''
   After they entered, the big-money crowd arrived after pre-opera
parties that included a museum supper at $175 a head, and the Opera
Guild's ball, in a large white tent, at $400 each. New York jeweler
Stan Silberstein was on hand for the guild's 5 p.m. bash.
   ``There isn't anything I could think of in New York that would
be a reason to be in black tie in the afternoon,'' he said.

   Pope John Paul II arrived in Harare
today on the first leg of a pilgrimage to five black-ruled nations
bordering racially-troubled South Africa.
   Before leaving Rome on the 10-day journey, the pontiff said he
hopes he can help solve some of white-led South Africa's problems
on a future trip there.
   His fourth journey to Africa and his 39th abroad will be to
Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe _ all
countries less than 20 years old that vehemently oppose South
Africa but depend on it for economic survival.
   In an unusual statement Friday, the Vatican emphasized the pope
was not snubbing South Africa and hoped to visit the country in the
future. It said the pope's full schedule on this trip made a stop
there impossible.
   The statement appeared directed at reports the pope had ruled
out a visit to South Africa, where a white minority rules 26
million blacks.
   During nearly 10 years at the helm of the Roman Catholic Church,
John Paul has strongly denounced apartheid.
   ``No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be
acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races,''
he said in a 1985 address in the Netherlands.
   In May, the pontiff received Anglican archbishop and 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu, who defiantly invited arrest and
prosecution Sunday by urging a boycott of Oct. 26 municipal
elections in South Africa.
   Tutu's challenge to the government came two days after the South
African law and order minister, Adriaan Vlok, said the time had
come to ``clip the wings'' of church leaders who hide behind the
``mask of liberation theology.'' Earlier this week, police armed
with a search warrant seized a tape of Tutu's sermon at the
archbishop's Cape Town office.
   When the pope greeted Tutu and other South African clergymen in
May, he said the system of racial segregation has exacted a
``terrible toll.'' Tutu urged tougher sanctions by Western nations
_ an issue on which the Vatican has not taken a position.
   South African Roman Catholic bishops, who have worked closely
with Anglicans, were waiting for the pope at his first stop in the
Zimbabwe capital of Harare. They are attending a conference of
regional bishops there.
   After a meeting with Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, the pope
planned to address the 71 bishops in a Dominican convent. The
speech, one of 42 drafted during a summer vacation in the
mountains, was expected to set the tone for the 12,400-mile voyage.
   In a document issued two years ago, the Vatican said it was
perfectly legitimate for the oppressed to take action _ such as
passive resistance _ to secure structures and institutions in which
their rights would be respected.
   But it warned clergy against direct involvement in politics and
against any efforts to inject Marxism into church work on behalf of
the poor.

   The floods that inundate this poor,
overpopulated nation with deadly regularity are a combination of
man-made and natural phenomena.
   This year's deluge _ the most devastating in memory _ has
claimed more than 600 lives by government count and more than 1,400
according to newspapers. It has submerged three-quarters of the
country, spawning disease and destroying homes, roads, bridges,
schools and food warehouses.
   From the air, Bangladesh looks like a large brown sea with
atolls where the map shows cities, towns and villages. Individual
rivers can no longer be discerned.
   The deluge comes just one year after a flood covered half the
country and claimed about 300 lives by government count and about
1,500 according to newspapers.
   Bangladesh, a country born in 1971, is seemingly condemned to
repeated disasters.
   The 1970-71 war of independence from Pakistan killed 3 million
people, according to the government. Since then, floods, cyclones
and tidal waves have claimed at least 20,000 lives. Even in the dry
season, overcrowded river ferries sink regularly, with losses of
life that often exceed 100.
   Bangladeshis meet this cycle of tragedy with acceptance that
often bewilders outsiders and has its roots in the Islamic
religion. Again and again, people lose their homes and their
families, but not their faith. They repeat: ``It is the will of
Allah (God).''
   Some of the causes of the disasters are internal, such as a
birthrate that has made Bangladesh one of the world's most densely
populated nations. Others, such as the floods, originate beyond its
borders and beyond its control.
   A series of historic shifts drew the borders that define
Bangladesh.
   When British-ruled India won its independence in 1947, the
borders of the Asian subcontinent dissolved and became two new
countries _ predominantly Hindu India and overwhelmingly Moslem
East and West Pakistan.
   The division left low-lying Bangladesh, then known as East
Pakistan, with little more than an overpopulated river delta barely
above sea level.
   East Pakistan, separated from West Pakistan by 1,000 miles of
India, was virtually defenseless against flood waters that cascade
from the mountains of neighboring India and Nepal.
   ``Obviously, India got the better deal,'' said Nazrul Islam,
chairman of Dhaka University's geography department. ``I think they
had stronger negotiators, more money, more knowledgeable and
educated people.''
   India got the oil fields of the Assam region, as well as West
Bengal with its port of Calcutta, a hub of industry, education and
government. East Pakistan got East Bengal _ a region of poor
farmers with rice paddies and jute fields. It also got the poor
area of Assam, including a few tea plantations.
   Today, Indian Assam pumps 96,000 barrels of oil a day.
Bangladesh finally struck oil there in 1986, but it is only pumping
about 600 barrels a day.
   ``If Pakistan hadn't asked for the area with the Moslems, it
wouldn't have gotten Bangladesh,'' said an Indian diplomat who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Calcutta and the oil were in
Hindu areas.''
   The 1971 civil war, when the Bengali-speaking East Pakistanis
rose against their Urdu-speaking rulers from West Pakistan, created
the independent nation of Bangladesh. But the new nation, free of
the West Pakistan-based government, was even further deprived of
the economic strength to combat natural disasters.
   Bangladesh has a per capita income of $150 a year, compared to
$371 in Pakistan and $260 in India.
   The population density is already 2,000 people per square mile,
the third highest in the world after the prosperous city-states of
Hong Kong and Singapore.
   In the past 41 years, Bangladesh's population has swelled from
40 million to 110 million. At the present birth rate, the
population will double in about 35 years.
   After the war of independence, the nation's few resources _ and
defenses against disasters _ were further eroded.
   Greedy contractors and poor farmers in search of fuel felled
entire forests on the Himalayan slopes in India and Nepal. The
deforestation eliminated vast tracts that had helped retain flood
waters and held back the silt that clogs the rivers and aggravates
flooding.
   Bangladeshis have virtually no place to live except on the
plains of rivers that overflow every year, when rain-swollen
currents rush through the width and breadth of Bangladesh to the
Bay of Bengal.
   The mightiest of the rivers _ the Brahmaputra, which starts in
China and flows through Tibet and India, the Ganges, which
originates in Nepal and runs through India, and the Meghna, which
rises in India _ are up to 12 miles wide under normal conditions
and spawn hundreds of tributaries.
   A cry rose arose from Bangladeshis for regional cooperation to
find an ecological solution to the onslaughts on a country former
U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger termed ``an
international basket case.''
   The call, repeated last week by Bangladesh's President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad, has gone largely unheeded.
   ``Ten years ago there was a proposal for the Himalayan
ecosystem,'' said Erling Dessau, head of the United Nations
Development Program in Bangladesh. ``There wasn't much interest in
it.''

<HEAD>Two West Germans Reported Captured In Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two West German doctors are believed
to have been captured in Afghanistan by the communist government as
they sought to help wounded guerrilla soldiers, a private aid
official said Saturday.
   Andreas von Ramdohr, spokesman for the Committee of German
Emergency Doctors, said Moslem guerrillas reported a man and a
woman from the group were apprehended by Afghan communist
authorities in the southeastern provincial capital of Ghazni.
   ``We cannot confirm it 100 percent. We have had no news from the
German embassy,'' von Ramdohr said.
   He declined to identify the two but said they were about a week
overdue returning from a trip to the central Afghan province of
Bamyan.
   Von Ramdohr said a guerrilla source reported that the pair was
driving toward Pakistan with a wounded rebel and a translator when
they lost their way and accidentally strayed into
communist-controlled territory.
   The Germans and their wounded charge were apprehended, but the
translator fled, according to the report. He said guerrillas
believed the couple were flown to Kabul Friday or Saturday.
   German embassy officials were unavailable for comment as the
mission was closed for the weekend.
   Soviet troops have been helping the Afghan government fight the
U.S.-backed guerrillas since December 1979. The Soviet Union agreed
in April to withdraw its estimated 115,000 troops by February 1989.

   The contribution of women to the Hispanic
culture of the United States is being featured at this year's
National Hispanic Heritage Week sponsored by the Smithsonian
Institution.
   Beginning Sunday, the weeklong celebration of performances,
lectures and exhibitions will mix Tex-Mex music and Latin jazz with
a review of the role of Hispanic women under the theme, ``500 Years
of Hispanic Heritage, 1492-1992: The Women's Contribution.''
   ``They are the carriers of the culture and traditions,'' says
Luz Maria Prieto, Hispanic-American history program coordinator at
the National Museum of American History.
   ``A very important part of their work was in the family, the
community, the workplace and the church,'' Ms. Prieto says. ``The
woman has always played a pivotal role, a crucial role in her
community.''
   Manuel J. Melendez, coordinator of Hispanic Week for the
Smithsonian, says that women ``did the nudging, the reminding. They
were the ones who had to hold it together, while the husbands were
out there working. ...
   ``Unbeknownst to them, their ingenuity was integral to the labor
movement _ when their husband came home from work, they would
bounce their ideas off the women and how they handled it is a
reflection of the countless conversations that take place in the
home,'' Melendez says.
   Scheduled events include Ruby Nelda Perez of San Antonio, Texas,
performing the one-woman play, ``A Woman's Work,'' and Jesus
``Chuy'' Negrete of the Mexican Cultural Institute of Chicago
performing some of his ``corridos,'' _ narrative ballads based on
the lives and histories of Mexican-American workers in the Midwest.
   At a ``Latina workers historical forum'' Blanca Vasquez of the
center for Puerto Rican studies at Hunter College in New York will
talk about Puerto Rican garment workers and Cynthia Orozco of the
University of California at Los Angeles will discuss the feminist
history of the League of United Latin American Citizens.
   Other activities include lectures by astronaut Sidney Gutierrez
and Reinaldo Arenas, one of today's leading Cuban writers in exile;
a performance of Latin rhythms and fiery jazz improvisation by
Hilton Ruiz; a Tex-Mex concert by Little Joe y la Familia; and
guided tours in Spanish and English of the National Museum of
American Art.

<HEAD>Dukakis Faced `The Troops' In Address To American Legion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 70th annual convention of the
American Legion, as conservative a conclave as one was likely to
find last week, was in high spirits for speeches by President
Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
   But some booed the mere mention of Michael Dukakis.
   So, why did the Democratic presidential nominee bother to show?
   ``He'd be foolish not to face the troops,'' said retired Marine
Andrew Steffanic, commander of the California Legion.
   The Massachusetts governor could not afford to ignore the
nation's largest veterans organization, ``even if he felt like he
wasn't going to sway the first vote,'' said Legionnaire Nathan
Wolfe.
   ``It would be detrimental to his campaign. The Legion is almost
3 million strong,'' said Wolfe, 58, of North Augusta, S.C.
   Democrat Walter Mondale clearly was no favorite of this group
when he ran against Reagan four years ago, but he ``toughed it
out'' at the Legion's 1984 convention, Steffanic said.
   Mondale paused in his speech, which to that point had been
received in stony silence, and jokingly advised his audience it was
OK to applaud. That brought laughter ``but he was no match
whatsoever for Reagan,'' said Steffanic, 67, of Portola, Calif.
   Dukakis' pitch before the American Legion on Thursday included
assurances that he favored a strong national defense, use of force
against terrorists and a Cabinet-level post for veterans' affairs.
He also lashed out at the Reagan administration for closing
hospitals, clinics and counseling centers and touted programs in
Massachusetts for homeless or unemployed veterans.
   ``An awful lot of guys who heard that speech were swayed,'' said
John Walsh, 36, a lawyer, disabled Air Force veteran and Dukakis
supporter from Quincy, Mass. ``He focused on the needs of veterans,
and the other two guys (Reagan and Bush) totally failed to do so.''
   Another Massachusetts delegate, Alfred Harwood of Lynn,
disagreed.
   ``I know some of the veterans' affairs that go on in
Massachusetts, and what (Dukakis) says up here and what he does,
doesn't agree,'' Harwood said. ``As far as the defense of this
country is concerned, I would have to agree with Bush. ... I'm not
going to vote for Dukakis.''
   Navy veteran George Ellerkamp, 65, said he was for Bush before
and after the convention.
   Even though Bush ``seemed nervous,'' including his blunder
Wednesday about Sept. 7 being Pearl Harbor Day, and although
veterans in general agree with Dukakis that the VA is in decline,
Ellerkamp said Dukakis said nothing to make him change his mind.
   ``I felt like both (Bush and Dukakis) told us what we wanted to
hear,'' said Ellerkamp, of St. Matthews, Ky.
   Also, veterans don't blame Reagan for cutting back VA services,
Ellerkamp said. ``They blame the system, not any individual,'' he
said.
   Walsh said most of those attending the convention were veterans
of World War II and Korea, older men who own homes, hold
established jobs or have retired, and have little in common with
Vietnam-era veterans.
   ``If you can afford to come to a national convention, you
certainly aren't representative of the average veteran on the
street,'' he said.
   Dukakis' reception was far politer than might have been expected
after Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., a staunch advocate of
veterans in Congress, was booed Wednesday for urging the
Legionnaires to ``listen attentatively'' to Dukakis' message.
   The heckling brought a stern rebuke from Legion National Cmdr.
John P. ``Jake'' Comer, also of Massachusetts.
   ``We will do our booing in the voting booth in November,'' Comer
said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court's Ideological Balance at Stake in November</HEAD>

   At stake in the voters' choice between George
Bush and Michael Dukakis in November is the delicate balance
between liberal and conservative justices that has set the Supreme
Court's ideological course in recent years.
   When the next president takes office, the three oldest and most
liberal justices on the nine-member high court will be over 80.
   The average age of the court's liberal wing will be a bit over
77. The average age of its conservative bloc will be 59.
   Bush almost certainly would appoint far more conservative
justices as president than Dukakis would.
   Four years ago, there were predictions that Reagan would have
the chance to decide the future of an aging Supreme Court for
generations to come, but things didn't work out that way.
   There is no question that the court is younger and more
conservative than it was at the start of Reagan's second term. But
liberal justices still exert critical influence, and Reagan's
opportunity to turn the court into a conservative stronghold has
passed.
   In this election year, however, predictions of sweeping changes
in the Supreme Court in the next four years seem more likely to
come true.
   The nine justices enjoy lifetime tenure. None is reported to
have grave health problems, and none has made any public mention of
retirement plans.
   The court's leading liberals are Justices William J. Brennan,
82, Thurgood Marshall, 80, and Harry A. Blackmun, soon to be 80.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, 68, often joins them, particularly in
criminal law decisions.
   The court's conservative bloc is led by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, 63. Its most conservative member is Antonin Scalia, 52.
   In varying degrees, the conservatives are bolstered by Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, 58, Anthony Kennedy, 52, and Byron R. White,
71.
   Unlike Reagan and Democratic nominee Walter Mondale in 1984, the
two presidential candidates this year have virtually ignored the
high court and their vision of its future in their stump speeches.
   Vice President Bush has noted that the next president ``will
very possibly appoint two or three justices to the Supreme Court,
where they'll sit well into the next century.''
   Bush promises to appoint judges ``who will interpret the
Constitution, not legislate from the bench.'' He also says he will
``appoint judges who don't reserve all their sympathy for
criminals; who understand that victims have rights, too.''
   The unspoken message appears to be that Bush, like Reagan, is
determined to select conservative justices who could sway the high
court's balance of power on such issues as abortion and affirmative
action.
   The court for years has been drifting toward more conservative
views regarding the rights of criminal suspects.
   As governor of Massachusetts, Dukakis has appointed numerous
judges who generally have been more liberal than conservative.
However, they are screened by an 18-member, non-ideological ``merit
commission.''
   Speculation about the impact that Bush or Dukakis might have on
the Supreme Court depends on who they would nominate and which
justices would be replaced.
   Reagan named O'Connor to the court in 1981. Since 1984, he has
appointed Scalia and Kennedy.
   All three are more conservative then the men they replaced, but
Reagan did not have a chance to place a conservative in a seat
formerly held by a liberal.
   O'Connor succeeded Potter Stewart, Scalia was a numerical
replacement for retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger after
Rehnquist was elevated to chief justice, and Kennedy succeeded
retired Justice Lewis F. Powell.
   The National Law Journal recently asked 40 court observers _
including campaign officials, former White House aides, federal
judges, law professors and lawyers _ to speculate on possible
nominees of Bush and Dukakis.
   The 10 people named most often as potential Bush nominees, in
alphabetical order, were:
   _James A. Baker, 58, former White House chief of staff who is
the Bush campaign chairman.
   _C. Boyden Gray, 45, the vice president's legal adviser since
1981.
   _Orrin G. Hatch, 54, a Republican senator from Utah.
   _Patrick E. Higginbotham, 49, of Dallas, a judge on the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   _Roger J. Miner, 54, of Albany, N.Y., a judge on the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   _Samuel R. Pierce Jr., 65, secretary of Housing and Urban
Development.
   _Pamela A. Rymer, 47, a federal trial judge in Los Angeles since
1983.
   _Richard L. Thornburgh, 58, the former Pennsylvania governor who
last month succeeded Edwin Meese III as attorney general.
   _Ralph K. Winter Jr., 53, of New Haven, Conn., a judge on the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   _Charles Alan Wright, 60, a law professor at the University of
Texas and a national authority on civil procedure and federal
jurisdiction.
   The 10 people named most often as potential Dukakis nominees, in
alphabetical order, were:
   _Derek Bok, 58, president of Harvard University and a former Law
School dean there.
   _Stephen G. Breyer, 50, of Boston, a judge on the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   _Mario M. Cuomo, 56, governor of New York.
   _Harry T. Edwards, 47, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington.
   _Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 55, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   _Amalya L. Kearse, 51, of New York, a judge on the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   _Paul J. Liacos, 59, a member of the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court.
   _Jon O. Newman, 56, of Hartford, Conn., a judge on the 2nd U.S.

<TEXT>
   Everyone showed up but the guest of honor, as
friends and former colleagues of an aircraft engineer who went to
lunch one day and never came back held their annual party on his
behalf.
   Members of the crowd that gathered at Tequila Willie's Saloon &
Grill in trendy Manhattan Beach on Friday said the disappearance
seven years ago of Ed Greer symbolized rebellion against the
corporate world.
   Richard Connett, Greer's old boss at the Hughes Aircraft Co.,
said others, himself included, have sometimes thought of
disappearing when the pressures of family and job began to get to
them. But Ed really did it.
   ``Hughes is full of very straight-laced people,'' said Sherry
McCulloh, Greer's former secretary. ``He is the anomaly. There is a
little bizarreness in all of us.''
   Meanwhile, party-goers wore ``Ed'' masks, and, borrowing the
``Where was George?'' catch phrase from this year's Democratic
National Convention, asked, ``Where is Ed?''
   Greer, an electronics engineer still in his early 30s and
already on the fast track at Hughes, cleaned out his files on Sept.
9, 1981, and disappeared a day later, leaving behind a wife of 12
years and two young sons.
   Hughes officials found his car one day later, with his wallet
and clothing inside, near the beach in Venice.
   But the theory that he drowned quickly evaporated when another
Hughes employee reported spotting Greer, dressed in jeans, at Los
Angeles International Airport around midnight the day he
disappeared.
   ``You haven't seen me,'' the 6-foot-2, bearded Greer told the
man, and a cult figure was born.
   When an investigation determined that his flight was not an act
of espionage _ Greer had access to classified information _ Greer's
colleagues let their imaginations run free.
   Employees started keeping pictures of Greer around the office,
sometimes pasting cutouts of his smiling face on other pictures to
show him on the beach or embraced with a bathing beauty.
   And every year since the disappearance, Hughes employees
celebrate the anniversary of his flight. The parties attract people
who didn't even know Greer.
   ``You can think of all kinds of bad things that might have
happened to him,'' Ms. McCulloh said. ``I like to think it was good
things.''
   She said she likes to think he wound up in Mexico or the
Bahamas, where he is leading the good life.
   But not everyone is amused.
   ``I'm kind of irritated about this party business,'' said
Greer's former wife, Kit, who divorced him after he disappeared.
``I know engineers ... It is mildy amusing to them.''

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci on
Saturday wrapped up his visit to China, leaving the Chinese happy
about a U.S. decision that could permit Chinese rockets to launch
U.S. satellites.
   Carlucci also said he was satisfied that the Chinese would
exercise prudence in their arms sales to the Middle East and other
areas of the world.
   Carlucci said he conveyed the U.S. decision about satellites to
National Defense Minister Qin Jiwei.
   ``He was most pleased with that,'' Carlucci told reporters at
the Wusong Naval Facility in Shanghai.
   The Reagan administration on Friday announced it would give
export licenses for satellites manufactured by Hughes Aircraft that
are scheduled to be launched for Australian and Hong Kong companies
with China's Long March rocket.
   The decision must be approved by the U.S. Congress and a group
of Western allies that monitor high-technology transfers.
   Hong Kong-based AsiaSat is to put a satellite in orbit next
year, while AusSat from Australia will launch two satellites in
1991 and 1992 using the Chinese service.
   Carlucci said he had recommended to Washington that the licenses
be approved.
   The settling of the satellite issue was the second major area of
friction solved during Carlucci's first trip to China.
   In Beijing, on Thursday, he told a news conference that he was
``fully satisfied'' with China's statement that it would exercise
prudence in its arms sales to the Middle East and other areas of
the world.
   Carlucci and Defense Department officials did not elaborate.
   He said his talks were ``the best discussions we've had'' on the
subject.
   The United States was concerned that Chinese sales of
medium-range missiles to Saudi Arabia and proposed sales to other
Middle East countries would upset the regional military balance.
   Qin Jiwei told reporters that Chinese arms sales were small
compared to those of the United States and were carried out
responsibly.
   Carlucci was led by navy Cmdr. Zhang Lianzhong on a 50-minute
tour of the Wusong base. He called the visit ``a sign of efforts to
have exchanges with the entire range of the Chinese military.''
   The defense secretary left after the tour for a flight to Hong
Kong.

<HEAD>Asian Officials Regret Passage Of U.S. Textile Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese official said Saturday he hopes
President Reagan will veto a bill approved by the U.S. Senate to
curb textile imports to the United States.
   ``It is regrettable that the U.S. Senate approved the bill,
ignoring the fact that U.S. textile exports have increased and the
industry did not perform as badly as many people believed,'' said
Chang Chang-han, acting secretary general of the Taiwan Textile
Federation.
   The Senate, by a 57-32 vote, Friday approved new curbs on
textile, clothing and shoe imports. The bill still needs approval
by the House of Representatives before it can be sent to President
Ronald Reagan.
   The bill would freeze this year's imports of textiles, apparel
and non-rubber footwear at 1987 levels and limit their growth to 1
percent annually thereafter.
   ``We hope President Reagan will veto the bill if it is passed by
the House,'' Chang said. ``Such a protectionist measure will only
hurt American consumers who would have to pay higher prices for
textile products.''
   The United States has been Taiwan's largest market for textile
goods. Last year, Taiwan's apparel and textile exports to the
United States totaled $3.2 billion, up 14 percent from 1986.
   During a meeting in Tokyo Saturday with visiting U.S. Commerce
Secretary C. William Verity, the Japanese minister of international
trade and industry, Hajime Tamura, expressed hope that the bill
would be vetoed by Reagan ``because of its protectionist nature,''
a ministry official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Japanese government had issued no formal reaction to the bill,
however.
   In Hong Kong, a leading trade official said the bill was
unnecessary and unlikely to survive a presidential veto.
   ``The bill is totally unnecessary and inappropriate ... because
the U.S. textile industry has been doing well,'' said Miranda Chiu,
acting assistant director of trade for the export-fueled British
colony.
   ``Any protectionist measure would definitely have adverse
effects on exporting countries (such as) Hong Kong,'' Chiu said.
She said it would be difficult to gauge the precise impact on the
colony because the bill does not provide details on how it would be
implemented.
   Exports from Hong Kong of apparel and clothing accessories to
the United States reached $3.4 billion in 1986, up 9 percent from
the previous year, according to the Census and Statistics
Department.
   Exports of textile fabrics to the United States totaled $116
million in 1986, up 11 percent from 1985, it said.

   Major environmental groups, some of them no
friends of the Reagan administration, have jumped to the defense of
federal forest firefighting policies attacked by some western
members of Congress.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., last week suggested that William
Penn Mott, director of the National Park Service, be fired for
following a ``let it burn'' policy in Yellowstone National Park.
   Environmental spokesmen accused Wallop of grandstanding and
called his suggestion ridiculous.
   Members of Congress who lead the committees overseeing the
parks, also heavily critical of the administraion at times,
defended the firefighting policy.
   ``I applaud the president and the secretary (of the interior)
for standing firm'' against Wallop's suggestion, said Paul
Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation
Association and a critic who has rarely applauded them for anything.
   ``Those who jump up in the midst of a major catastrophe and cry
bloody murder and `Off with their heads' remind me of Alice in
Wonderland,'' Pritchard said.
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, one of the three-member
inspection team sent by President Reagan to Yellowstone over the
weekend, has called the firefighting policy a ``disaster.''
   The ``disaster'' remark was clearly intended as ``hindsight,''
said spokesman Alan Levitt, and Hodel stands by an earlier
statement that what the park service and other agencies ``need now
is our understanding of the difficulties they face and our
support.''
   The Park Service since 1972 has followed a so-called ``let it
burn'' policy which fights forest fires caused by humans and
natural fires that threaten human lives and property, but lets most
natural fires burn for the benefits they bring to forest
regeneration.
   A century of fuel buildup from suppressing fires _ Yellowstone
was declared a park in 1872 _ are worsening fires today, some
suggested.
   ``There's been a lot of inaccurate information passed around,''
said Tim Mahoney of the Sierra Club. Because of the drought,
``These fires are going to get away from you no matter what the
policy is.''
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., chairman of the national parks
subcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
toured Yellowstone in August.
   ``I don't mind telling you I was glad to get out of there''
because of the fire danger and the fuel buildup, said Bumpers on
Friday. ``There were as many trees on the ground as there were
standing.''
   ``The fire management policies of the Park Service and the
Forest Service are sound, flexible and scientifically based. We
support them,'' said a statement by George Frampton, president of
the Wilderness Society.
   Referring to Hodel's ``disaster'' remark, Wilderness Society
spokesman Ben Beach said, ``I thinking he's hanging Mott out to
dry. ... Mott has been one of the bright spots in an awful record.''
   ``We think the calls for Mott to resign are ridiculous,'' said
Robert SanGeorge, spokesman for the National Audubon Society in New
York.
   ``Though we don't favor letting people's houses burn down, we're
concerned that (calling for Mott's dismissal) would be the popular
thing to do to respond to people who are concerned about their
property,'' SanGeorge said. ``Politics should not intrude on
biology.''
   Bumpers has promised a hearing on the fires at the request of
Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont. _ after the fires are out.
   Yellowstone Superintendent ``Bob Barbee oughtn't be made a
scapegoat, and Bill Mott oughtn't be made a scapegoat,'' Bumpers
said.
   ``Are you going to fire (Forest Service chief) Dale Robertson?
The Forest Service fought every fire. There are fires burning out
of control in Washington State right now (on Forest Service
land),'' Bumpers said. ``There are some places where Mother Nature
takes control and man just can't do anything.''
   ``I'm not interested in hearing from Bill Mott or Don Hodel, but
guys who know something about fire and horticulturists,'' Bumpers
said. ``We're going to have a serious review. I'm not going to
permit it to degenerate into vindictiveness, and I don't think Sen.
Wallop or Sen. Melcher, who both serve on my subcommittee, want
that.''
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of the counterpart House
subcommittee, said the policies ``are appropriate. Plans for
fighting fires in Yellowstone have been on paper for a very long
time. ... We'll review the policies. We'll learn things.''
   Vento said he believed Wallop ``is trying to find a scapegoat
and I don't think that's appropriate.''
   Jay D. Hair, executive vice president of the National Wildlife
Federation, with 5 million members the nation's largest
conservation group, said, ``I don't think this is the time for
political grandstanding and I think that is precisely what Sen.
Wallop is doing.''
   Derrick Crandall, president of the American Recreation
Coalition, a trade association containing tourist and recreation
businesses, said he had spoken with Wallop a few weeks ago and ``he
feels the Park Service wasn't listening'' to his concerns and those
of his constituents.
   ``I understand the frustration of Sen. Wallop,'' Crandall said.
``There are very good arguments for the let-it-burn policy, and I
think most people in the recreation-tourism community understand
that.''
   But, he said, ``I don't have all the facts and I'm not going to
suggest we know at this point what Director Mott should or should
not have done.''

   The government today ordered a Vietnamese diplomat
who confronted demonstrators with a gun outside his embassy to
leave Britain.
   An announcement by the Foreign Office said Vietnamese Third
Secretary Khang Than Nhan must leave the country by Sunday.
   Vietnamese Ambassador Tran Van Hung, pressed by the British
government about Khang's actions Sept. 4., turned over a toy gun on
Thursday.
   But today he gave a real gun to junior Foreign Office minister
Timothy Eggar and said it was the one Khang was holding when he
confronted Vietnamese refugees protesting in front of the embassy,
the Foreign Office said.
   A government statement said Tran told Eggar he could not waive
Khang's diplomatic immunity to enable Britain to prosecute the
third secretary. On Thursday, the ambassador had agreed that Khang
would forgo his immunity.
   On Sept. 4, the demonstrators that Khang confronted took
photographs of him holding a gun. The pictures were published in
London's Daily Express.
   The Foreign Office said earlier this week that it took a very
serious view of the incident and warned the ambassador of the
``gravest consequences'' unless the diplomat's immunity was waived.
   Diplomatic missions in Britain are not supposed to house arms.
   The government has taken violations of that rule seriously since
a gunman firing from the Libyan Embassy killed a London policewoman
during a protest demonstration in April 1984. After a police siege
of the embassy, the building was closed and diplomatic relations
severed.

<TEXT>
   Sgt. John Maggard and his wife, Kim,
have won a long, bureaucratic battle to get their adopted son with
AIDS into the United States. Now they face a sterner test: keeping
him alive.
   Jared Maggard ``has three weeks, three months, three years; we
don't know,'' says his mother. His father says: ``Without a cure,
we know Jared will die. Our goal is to give him as much time as
possible.''
   The miracle the Maggards hope for is a cure for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, which Jared had when he was born to a young
Panamanian woman and an unknown father.
   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most
often transmitted through sexual contact, transfusions of tainted
blood and the sharing of contaminated needles by drug abusers. AIDS
can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth.
   When the Maggards found Jared, abandoned in a hospital in Colon,
Panama, they didn't know he had AIDS. He was 11 months old, weighed
3{ pounds and was being treated for malnutrition. Pictures show
skeletal arms and legs, ribs visible beneath thin, stretched skin,
eyes sunken in an almost fleshless skull.
   Kim, 25, had recently suffered a miscarriage, and she and her
husband, a 26-year-old Army policeman then stationed at Fort Gulick
on the Pacific end of the Panama Canal, fell in love with the child.
   The couple, from Ypsilanti, Mich., consulted Army attorneys,
hired a Panamanian lawyer and began adoption proceedings. They were
quickly granted custody. The adoption became final last Wednesday.
   When the Maggards took Jared home from the hospital in December
1986, he also was suffering from an ear infection. His new mother
pumped food into him _ sugar water, infant formula laced with
cereal, canned baby food by the carton.
   Jared gained weight, but despite repeated visits to Army
clinics, the ear infection persisted. Finally, 11 months later,
doctors, puzzled by their inability to cure the infection with
standard antibiotics, ran a series of tests. They showed Jared had
AIDS.
   ``There's no doubt he had it from birth,'' Mrs. Maggard said in
a recent interview. ``And children born with AIDS don't usually
live beyond the age of 2. The prognosis is between 2 and 6 years at
the most, and there have been only a few cases in which an infected
child has reached the age of 6.''
   The AIDS-positive test results came back on Sept. 15, 1987, a
month before Sgt. Maggard was to begin a new assignment in the
United States. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
officials, the U.S. consul general in Panama and army lawyers told
the couple they could not take Jared home with them.
   ``We were told it was against the law for anyone with AIDS to
enter the United States, and, besides, the adoption was not
complete at the time,'' says Mrs. Maggard. ``We were told we should
give Jared back and forget about it. I wasn't about to do that.''
   Sgt. Maggard extended his tour of duty in Panama for another
year rather than leave without his son. But repeated entreaties by
the young couple failed to sway a government and military
bureaucracy.
   On July 4, Willard Scott, the NBC Television weatherman, came to
Panama to preside over an Independence Day celebration for U.S.
servicemen and women and their families. By chance, he met Mrs.
Maggard, who told him of the couple's plight. NBC aired the story
briefly on its nightly news program in early August.
   ``The next day, the telephone began ringing off the hook,'' says
Mrs. Maggard. From those calls, the Maggards say, they learned for
the first time of a provision in immigration rules that allow some
AIDS victims into the United States on a parole basis.
   ``We had never heard of that before,'' says Mrs. Maggard.
``Nobody down here had ever told us of that. But the Army was
clearly embarrassed, and it suddenly got behind us 100 percent.''
   Sgt. Maggard says his commanding officer has told him that he
can transfer to any one of four military posts in the United States
where the Army has AIDS treatment centers.
   He says he will choose within the next week or so whether to go
to the Washington, D.C., area, to be near the Walter Reed Medical
Center, or to Fort Sam Houston, Tex., where the Army hospital has a
ward devoted to AIDS patients.
   ``In the United States, Jared can be treated with AZT, and
that's not available to Army doctors overseas,'' says Mrs. Maggard.
AZT is a new drug recently approved for AIDS treatment by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. It is not a cure, but has been found
to prolong the life of some victims by strengthening their immune
systems.
   As the Maggards spoke, Jared, now a chubby, outwardly healthy
appearing youngster of almost 3 years, played underfoot, jabbering
in childish English and his native Spanish, part of a culture his
parents say they are bent on preserving for him.
   ``Everybody remarks about how healthy he looks,'' said Mrs.
Maggard. ``But he has a lung infection that won't clear up, and
doctors say there are seven stages in the progression of AIDS.
Given the diseases Jared already has had, they figure he is in the
fifth or sixth stage.''

<HEAD>Salinas Confirmed As Mexico's Next President</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a long and bitter debate, the Chamber
of Deputies today certified Carlos Salinas de Gortari as president
of Mexico.
   A spokesman for the chamber said the vote was 263-85.
   Opposition lawmakers, who claim Salinas won the July 6 election
through massive vote fraud, tried to stall the certification
process by making numerous speeches during an all-night session.
But they had no chance of prevailing.
   Salinas will begin a six-year term Dec. 1 and replace Miguel de
la Madrid.
   The raucous debate occurred because the election placed the
largest number of opposition lawmakers in the legislature since the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was founded
nearly 60 years ago.
   As expected, today's vote was along party lines. PRI, won a
majority of 260 in the 500-person chamber in the election, and at
least three opposition deputies have since defected to the
governing party.
   Orlando Arvizu, a PRI deputy from Hidalgo state, said Friday
evening the chamber debate would continue ``until we certify the
presidential election.''
   ``If it's up to us, it (the confirmation) could last three days.
We plan to destroy their arguments one by one,'' said a Popular
Socialist spokesman.
   The Popular Socialist Party belongs to the left-of-center
Democratic Front coalition headed by former presidential candidate
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
   On Friday, opposition delegates walked out on a key legislative
committee but failed to prevent the panel from recommending
Salinas' confirmation.
   The PRI members on the committee declared the July 6 election
valid and said Salinas won with 50.74 percent. The panel said
Cardenas won 31.06 percent, and Manuel Clouthier of the rightist
National Action Party won 16.81 percent.
   The PRI accused the opposition of trying to derail an orderly
presidential transition. ``What they are seeking is to destabilize
the government and degrade the republic, its institutions and its
politics,'' it said.

<HEAD>High Percentage Of Teachers Profess Belief In Supernatural</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high percentage of high school biology
teachers profess superstitious beliefs and about one in four think
some races of people are inherently more intelligent than others,
according to a survey.
   Also, about 19 percent of the teachers believe dinosaurs and
humans lived at the same time, according to the national survey by
two University of Texas at Arlington researchers that will be
released this week, The Dallas Morning News reported in its
Saturday editions.
   Dr. Raymond Eve, associate professor of sociology at UTA, and
Dr. Dana Dunn, assistant professor of sociology, mailed
questionnaires to biology teachers to try to determine why many
college students held pseudoscientific beliefs, a finding of a 1987
survey.
   The two researchers sent a 12-page, 88-item questionnaire to
about 400 teachers selected at random from a list of 20,000
provided by the National Science Teachers Association. They
received 200 responses; the survey had a 5 percentage point margin
of error.
   Eve said he hoped the results would spur further research.
   The results, when compared with an international study of
high-school students' biology knowledge, show ``we're doing
something very, very, very wrong in biology education,'' Ms. Dunn
said.
   A study this year by the International Association for the
Evaluation of Educational Achievement found U.S. students scoring
no higher than eighth among 13 countries in the sciences and last
in biology.
   The Texas researchers found what Eve called ``racial bigotry''
in responses to the survey statement: ``Some races of people are
more intelligent than others.''
   Twenty-six percent of the respondents said the statement was
``definitely true'' or ``probably true,'' while 24 percent circled
``inconclusive evidence.''
   Based on the survey responses, Eve said, ``there's a sort of
racism'' that major cultural accomplishments, such as the Egyptian
pyramids or Incan religious structures ``couldn't have been built
by stupid Indians; it had to be white Europeans or space gods.''
   Eve said 94 percent of those surveyed were white and 63 percent
were male.
   Central to the study _ and most surprising to the researchers _
was that biology teachers seemed to misunderstand ``what science is
all about,'' Eve said.
   Given the statement, ``Scientists seek facts, but sometimes the
best they can do is theories,'' only 5 percent correctly answered
``definitely false.''
   A theory is not an ``educated guess,'' as many lay people
believe, he said. Science is a systematic method of arriving at
conclusions, or theories, using the facts as a basis, he said.
   Eve and Ms. Dunn cited poor teacher training as a major reason
for the pseudoscientific and superstitious beliefs. In Texas, for
example, teachers are allowed to instruct one class a day outside
their areas of certification.
   Only about 25 percent of teachers surveyed have degrees in
biology. And too often, the study found, the science class was the
teacher's secondary area of instruction, or the teacher had only
science education as a major.
   Respondents to the survey were given statements and asked to
agree or disagree.
   Some of their responses included:
   _Dinosaurs and humans lived at the same time; 33 percent of the
respondents agreed or weren't sure.
   _It is impossible for the living to communicate with the dead;
27 percent disagreed.
   _Some people can predict future events by actual psychic power,
not just by intuition; 28 percent agreed.
   _One cannot read other people's thoughts by psychic powers; 34
percent disagreed.
   About 30 percent of high school biology teachers indicated they
believe in biblical creationism, the belief that the universe and
all its living things were created by a supreme being from nothing
in seven days about 10,000 years ago, rather than evolution.
   ``There can be no question that we are in a disastrous
situation,'' Eve said. ``Evolution is central to the understanding
of biology.''

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's Olympic team canceled
reservations on a jetliner two days before it crashed while
approaching Bangkok airport, killing 75 people, officials were
quoted as saying Saturday.
   Thai officials said they expected Soviet experts to join a team
of Vietnamese and Thai experts to investigate the Air Vietnam
accident. The Soviet-made Tu-134 jetliner with 81 people aboard was
flying from the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi Friday when it slammed
into a rice field and exploded four miles north of Bangkok airport
during a thunderstorm.
   The six survivors, including the pilot, remained in intensive
care Saturday at Bhumibol Hospital.
   Pham Vu Hien, a senior official of Air Vietnam, said the plane
apparently was hit by lightning, Japan's Kyodo news service
reported. A Vietnamese pilot who was among the six survivors
earlier gave the same cause for the accident.
   Hien said the airline will pay compensation to the relatives of
each victim, Kyodo said.
   Japan's Nihon television network quoted Vietnamese officials as
saying Vietnam's 16-member Olympic team canceled reservations on
the flight two days before the crash.
   Among the dead were Vietnam's public health minister, Dang Hoi
Huan, and its ambassador-designate to the Philippines, Nguyen
Dhuong Vu. Also killed were India's ambassador to Vietnam, Arun
Patwardhan, and seven other officials of his embassy. No Americans
were aboard the plane.
   Workers retrieved all 75 bodies from the wreckage on Friday.
   Thai newspapers said Saturday that workers of two charity groups
argued heatedly over who would be first to retrieve the bodies.
Workers of the Poh Tech Tung and Ruamkratanyoo foundations have
previously have fought bloody battles at accident sites.
   The Poh Tech Tung volunteers claimed they spotted a body first,
the Nation newspaper reported. But their rivals argued that they
were the first to grab the victim's feet, it said.
   ``The argument would have erupted into a fist fight had the
police not intervened,'' the newspaper said.
   State-run Radio Hanoi reported Saturday that Vietnam's Prime
Minister Do Muoi ordered an investigation into the crash.
   The plane broke into three when it hit the ground. The pieces
were scattered on a dirt road, a rice field and a pond, where the
charred cockpit and fuselage were found along with most of the
bodies. Two flight data recorders were recovered from the crash
site.
   The Tu-134, the Vietnamese flag carrier's main aircraft, also is
used by the Soviet airline Aeroflot. Several Tu-134s have crashed
in recent years, including one in Siberia in February that killed
an undisclosed number of people, and one in October 1986 that
killed President Samora Machel of Mozambique.
   The Japanese aviation magazine Kokujoho said the plane, which
was introduced in 1963, is no longer manufactured. Air Vietnam
officials said they lack funding to buy newer, Western-made planes.
   The last major plane crash in Thailand was Aug. 31, 1987, when a
Thai Airways domestic airliner fell into the sea off the southern
resort island of Phuket, killing all 83 people aboard the Boeing
737.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan described the educational
record of his administration as a triumph of ``common sense
answers'' Saturday, but Senate Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd
denounced the administration's educational policies as ``terribly
wrong.''
   Reagan, taking note of the beginning of the academic year this
week in many schools, said from the Oval Office in his weekly radio
address that the prospects for education are ``brighter than they
have been for over two decades.''
   Byrd, responding for the Democrats, charged that ``nothing has
been done by the White House to link America's economic future to
rebuilding our nation's educational system. Nothing at all.''
   Reagan, as he has in many of his recent radio addresses, put in
a plug for Vice President George Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee.
   ``The recovery of our schools has been a genuine grassroots
accomplishment, and it proves the solution to problems is not to
throw money at them but to come up with common sense answers and
start applying them,'' the president said.
   ``I am proud that during our administration George Bush and I
have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand.''
   Byrd, however, said, ``If the White House had its way, Pell
grants (for needy college and university students) would be cut by
40 percent, college work study programs would end, vocational
education would stop altogether, and aid to graduate school
students would come to a halt. Even the `drug free' school program
would be cut by 50 percent.''
   ``My friends, this is terribly wrong,'' the West Virginia
senator said.
   ``The administration subtracts from education,'' Byrd said.
``The Congress adds to save it.''
   ``I don't understand why the administration hasn't done its
homework,'' he said.
   Reagan conceded that there are shortcomings in the schools.
   ``We have just begun,'' he said. ``Far too many students are
graduating from schools without the skills they need to prosper and
the knowledge they need to grow.''
   ``The education our children need is the ability to read, write
and reason as well as any student in any country in the world,''
the president said.
   Byrd said, ``The White House talks a lot about the three R's.
But when it comes to helping education, their three R's amount to
rhetoric, reductions, and retrenchment.''
   The president also said that ``the education of all Americans
must be rooted in the self-evident truths of Western civilization''
- a proposition that has been assailed on some college campuses.
   ``Since the founding of this nation, education and democracy
have gone hand in hand,'' he said.
   ``Every American is the inheritor of our great cultural
tradition,'' he said. ``That's why I have supported and continue to
support all efforts to reach our children about our culture, to
read great texts and learn their lessons.''

<HEAD>Rancher Wins Libel Judgment Over Deaths Of Pesticide-Sprayed
Cattle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAVIS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rancher who lost 500 cows after they were
sprayed with a since-banned pesticide has won a $7 million libel
judgment stemming from a university report blaming all but one of
the deaths on improper care.
   The chancellor of the University of California at Davis said
Friday that an appeal is planned of a jury's $7 million award to
George Neary of Chico.
   After a four-month trial, an Alameda County jury decided
Thursday in favor of Neary for a UC-Davis report quoting
investigators as saying that the 1979 deaths of 500 of Neary's
cattle resulted from inadequate feeding and care.
   The report concluded that only one death was due to the state's
spraying of toxaphene to fight a feared infestation of scabies
mites.
   Against Neary's wishes, the pesticide was sprayed by Department
of Food and Agriculture veterinarians on a herd of cattle he had
recently bought in Oregon and transported to his ranch 10 miles
north of Chico.
   In 1982, the federal Environmental Protection Agency banned most
uses of toxaphene. The chemical has been linked to cancer in humans.
   Neary contended the UC-Davis report libeled him by depicting him
as an incompetent rancher and implying that his ranching practices
led to his cattle's deaths.
   Neary's lead attorney, John Keker, said the three veterinarians
named in the lawsuit lied in their report to protect the
university's close ties with state veterinarians as well as the
chemical and beef industries.
   ``It looked like science, but actually it was science fiction,''
he said. Davis Chancellor Theodore L. Hullar said officials there
were ``stunned to learn of the jury's verdict.''
   ``The expert opinion requested of our veterinary professors was
offered in good faith and after a rigorous and objective study,''
he said. ``Their field investigations and laboratory analyses were
thorough, their conclusions soundly reasoned and their conduct
above reproach.''
   Hullar said the decision would be appealed and the university
would not allow it to ``deter our involvement in other potentially
controversial areas requiring impartial and expert analysis.''
   The veterinarians were Richard McCapes, assistant dean of the
School of Veterinary Medicine, and faculty members Charles Hjerpe
and Ben Norman. They have a libel suit pending against Neary and
CBS News for comments he made in a ``60 Minutes'' program.
   After the verdict, Neary said the UC system ``has been covering
up for these murders too long. Animals, rivers, women, Mexican
farmworkers are all being poisoned. It's been going on too long and
it's got to be stopped.''
   Neary sought $12 million in the lawsuit, which was heard in
Superior Court in Oakland because the UC system headquarters are
located in nearby Berkeley.
   Neary also has a suit pending in U.S. District Court in Fresno
against state veterinarians who sprayed the toxaphene at his ranch.

   Actress Melina Mercouri, Greece's minister of
culture and science, canceled her appearance as guest of honor at a
celebration of the Walters Art Gallery's exhibition of Greek
artworks, forcing the gallery to cancel the black-tie event.
   ``It was just an unfortunate consequence of fate,'' said gallery
director Robert P. Bergman.
   ``The poor woman is exhausted and ill,'' he said Saturday. ``She
apologized to us. She sent us a very nice telegram.''
   Though the planned Friday gala was canceled, Ms. Mercouri's
brother Spyros Mercouris, coordinator of international exhibitions
for the Greek government, toured the show, accompanied by Greek
Ambassador George Papoulias, Bergman said.
   Howard White, a spokesman for the museum, said that when Ms.
Mercouri, 62, gave her regrets, ``We decided the only ethical thing
to do was to cancel the black-tie reception and dinner. We felt
badly about that, but we promised them Melina.''
   ``At something like this, if the guest of honor doesn't show up,
the event loses much of its cachet.''

   Country singer Roy Clark says he is
eager to return to the Soviet Union for a second good-will tour.
   Tennessee Sens. Albert Gore Jr. and Jim Sasser, and George
Lindsey, one of Clark's co-stars on the television show
``Hee-Haw,'' joined Clark at a fund-raising dinner in his honor
Friday night. The host of the dinner was comedian Bob Hope.
   Proceeds from the dinner will help pay for Clark's return to the
Soviet Union, which is also getting funds from U.S. and Soviet
government agencies. He is due to leave in mid-November for a tour
that will include 12 concerts in Moscow and Leningrad.
   ``I guess I was the first person to introduce country music to
the Russians, and they loved it,'' Clark said. ``I, in turn, loved
them. They're just people, not so different from us.''
   ``I send him to Russia with love,'' Hope quipped. ``It's either
send him or deport him. Who else would want him, except maybe his
wife?''

   Bibs, booties and other gifts that
Beatrice residents collected for Britain's newest princess _ named
Beatrice _ will be given to a London children's hospital, city
officials said.
   The gifts were shipped to Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary of
York, daughter of Andrew and Sarah, the Duke and Duchess of York.
In addition to baby shower-type gifts, they included Nebraska and
Beatrice T-shirts, an engraved watch from the local jewelry store,
and an offer of a scholarship to Southeast Community College's
Beatrice campus.
   Locals organized the project to draw attention to the name
shared by the princess, who was born Aug. 8, and the southeastern
Nebraska community of 19,000.
   However, Beatrice Chamber of Commerce President Diane Schwenke
said organizers have been notified that the package could not be
delivered because the royal family's policy is not to accept gifts.
   After discussions with British officials, they decided to send
the gifts to Children's Hospital of London in the name of Princess
Beatrice, she said. They still hope that some of the cards, letters
and honorary proclamations will find their way to the royal family.
   ``The whole thing really did benefit Beatrice, Nebraska, a
lot,'' Mrs. Schwenke said. ``It did a lot to put our community on
the map.''

   Actress Valerie Harper and her husband stand
to lose nearly $23 million in future profits as a result of her
being dropped from the hit show originally titled ``Valerie,'' her
attorney said.
   Closing arguments were completed Friday in a contract dispute
between Lorimar Productions and Miss Harper, who was dropped from
the television show, along with her husband, last year. The judge
planned to give instructions to the jury Monday.
   Attorney Barry Langberg, who represents Miss Harper and her
husband, Tony Cacciotti, said the couple lost nearly $23 million in
future profits when they were cut out of the show. Cacciotti was
co-executive producer of the show.
   The figure was calculated by estimating the value of each
episode of ``Valerie,'' an NBC situation comedy. After Miss Harper
left the show, it was retitled ``The Hogan Family.''
   Langberg argued that Miss Harper was a perfectionist who wanted
to deliver the best show possible. He also portrayed Lorimar's
dismissal of the couple as unjustified and an act of bad faith.
   Donald Engel, an attorney for Lorimar, said Miss Harper made a
deal to quit the show, but became dissatisfied with it afterward.
Attorneys contended that Miss Harper made demands for more money
and staged months of bruising emotional battles on the set.

   Country singer William Lee Golden has
reached an out-of-court settlement in a $40 million suit against
his former partners in the Oak Ridge Boys quartet, his attorney
said.
   ``There is money involved and both sides are happy it's over,''
attorney Wayne Halper said Friday. He refused to reveal the amount
of the settlement.
   Golden was forced out of the group in March 1987, after 22
years. Duane Allen, Joe Bonsall and Richard Sterban voted him out,
citing friction among band members. He was replaced by Steve
Sanders.
   ``This thing was more akin to a divorce than a suit for
damages,'' Halper said. ``There was nothing to be gained by having
a public airing of differences.''
   Golden is now concentrating on a solo career and plans to begin
recording songs this fall, Halper said.
   The Oak Ridge Boys are best known for their 2 million-selling
hit, ``Elvira.'' Since Golden's departure, the group has put the
single ``True Heart'' on the country charts.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, it's September, a time when our children
once again return to school bright with promise and eager for
instruction. I'm happy to report that if the record of the past
eight years is any indication, the prospects for their education
are bright; brighter than they've been for more than two decades.
   Test scores are up, reversing a calamitous drop in scores over
the years between 1963 and 1980. Attendance is up, and the number
of kids who drop out of high school is down. The recovery of our
schools has been a genuine grassroots accomplishment and it proves
the solution to problems is not to throw money at them, but to come
up with commonsense answers and start applying them.
   I'm proud that during our administration, George Bush and I have
been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand. But we've
only just begun. Far too many American students are graduating from
school without the skills they will need to prosper and the
knowledge they'll need to grow as adults. And no one knows this
better than America's parents who rose up at the beginning of the
decade and said, ``Our children are not getting the education they
want, need and deserve.''
   The education our children want is the ability to discover the
answers to the basic questions we all have: Who am I? Where do I
live, and what is the world around me like? Children yearn to learn
and their capacity for it is one of the God-given wonders. The
education our children need is the ability to read, write and
reason as well as any student in any country in the world. They
need it and the nation needs it as well if we're to prosper and
grow.
   The education our children deserve is the kind no American
should be deprived of, for it's the basic instruction in what it
means to be an American. I believe that the education of all
Americans must be rooted in the self-evident truths of western
civilization. These are the truths that have been passed down like
precious heirlooms from generation to generation since the
generations began.
   Since the founding of this nation, education and democracy have
gone hand in hand. Thomas Jefferson not only wrote the Declaration
of Independence and served as our third president, but also founded
one of our most distinguished institutions of higher learning _ the
University of Virginia. Jefferson and the founders believed a
nation that governs itself like ours must rely upon an informed and
engaged electorate. Their purpose was not only to teach all
Americans how to read and write, but to instill the self-evident
truths that are the anchors of our political system, truths, to
quote Jefferson, such as ``All men are created equal,'' that ``they
are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights,''
that ``among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''
   This is our precious heritage and our political freedoms, the
freedom to speak, to practice our religions, to assemble
peacefully, are the product of ideas that were born and nurtured in
the great tradition of western civilization. That tradition does
not say some men have these rights. It says all men, everywhere on
this earth whether of Asian, Hispanic or African, dissent, no
matter what color. Every American is the inheritor of our great
cultural tradition.
   That's why I've supported and continue to support all efforts to
teach our children about our culture, to read great texts and learn
their lessons. Bill Bennett, our secretary of education, has just
reported on the state of elementary education in our country. That
report, entitled, ``James Madison Elementary Schools,'' presents an
outline for what every elementary school curriculum should include.
It is suffused with the glory of western civilization and I salute
it.
   We owe our children no less than to instruct them in what
Matthew Arnold called, ``The best that has been known and said.''
And yet just as forcefully I want to say that this curriculum is
only a guideline for school districts to follow if they think it
right. The final arbiter of what a child should learn is not the
state, but the family and the community in which the child lives.
And so I support the right of all parents to choose the education
they believe is best for their children in the form of magnet
schools and state programs like Minnesota's which permits parents
to choose which schools their children can attend.
   In addition, programs like Youth 2000, which teaches kids to
rely on themselves and to say no to drugs are vital in our efforts.
Yes, we're blessed to be the recipients of this cultural bounty,
and we must be responsibile too. As the Constitution says, ``secure
the blessings to our posterity.''
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's radio address Saturday, given by Sen. Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va.:
   This week millions of American children went back to school.
These young people represent America's future.
   Today, I want to take issue with what the president has been
saying about education. Let's set the record straight.
   For seven years now the Congress and the administration have
been working on our arithmetic. The administration subtracts from
education. The Congress adds to save it.
   For seven years now we Democrats have been trying to educate the
administration about the value of education. It hasn't helped.
   I'm not surprised. This White House has never had a real
commitment to excellence in education. I don't understand why the
administration hasn't done its homework.
   America's future economic prosperity depends on having the best
educated workforce in the world. Put simply, an educated America is
a strong America.
   Just two days ago the Council on Competitiveness stated that
America is developing an ``ominous'' dependence on foreign
professors and researchers. Forty percent of all engineering
students graduating from American colleges and universities are now
foreign-born. We now import brains and intellectual talent the same
way that we import cars and radios.
   Why do we rely so heavily on foreign talent? Because our schools
are not teaching our children the math and science skills they need
for our new high-tech economy. And that's not all. According to a
recent survey, 75 percent of all American students could not locate
the Persian Gulf on a world map.
   The alarm has been sounded again and again. Yet nothing has been
done by the White House to link America's economic future to
rebuilding our nation's educational system. Nothing at all.
   This White House talks a lot about the three R's. But when it
comes to helping education, their three R's amount to rhetoric,
reductions and retrenchment.
   If the White House had its way, Pell grants would be cut by 40
percent, college work study programs would end, vocational
education would stop altogether, and aid to graduate school
students would come to a halt. Even the ``drug free'' school
program would be cut by 50 percent.
   My friends, this is terribly wrong.
   It used to be that a high-school diploma was the guarantee of a
good job and the chance to marry and settle down. Now, even our
high school graduates are struggling. Put simply, you can't get
ahead unless you have the best education possible.
   But getting a good college education is almost out of reach for
these young Americans and for millions of other Americans.
   There are hundreds of thousands of middle-class families
struggling to make ends meet, so they can send their children to
college. They want their children to get ahead _ to be a part of an
American dream.
   But in the last seven years their sacrifice has gone unrewarded.
Even though college tuitions have risen by 60 percent since 1981,
again and again the administration has tried to cut student aid. I
have had to vote 14 times in the last seven years to protect
student loan programs. Fourteen times!
   And, when it comes to doing something about adult illiteracy,
the White House blackboard is completely blank. Twenty-three
million Americans are now functionally illiterate. How difficult it
must be to live a life when you cannot read and write; when you
cannot read the Bible, or a story to your children, or even the
funny pages in the newspaper.
   Yet, these illiterate Americans are the very Americans who can
make the difference, if America is to stay No. 1. If we want
America to be strong in every way, we need to recognize that smart
students are just as important as smart weapons. In my home state
of West Virginia, the students who answered my annual survey know
that too! Forty percent of them rated education as the first
priority of the federal government.
   We need leadership in the White House that appreciates the value
of education as much as do the young people of West Virginia.
   I am encouraged that at least one of the presidential candidates
has made a pledge that no college student should be turned away
from college because they can't get financial aid.
   The education formula for America's future prosperity is clear:
good schools equal a smart workforce and that adds up to an America
that is still the best.
   Let's do our homework now, so we don't flunk later. In this
course America can't afford to fail.
   Thank you and may God bless you.

<TEXT>
   A millionaire grandfather landed a
330-pound airplane in his homeland Saturday after a 23-day flight
from Britain that set a record for ultralight aviation.
   Vijaypat Singhania's ultralight plane made a perfect landing at
New Delhi's Safdarjung Airport at 11:10 a.m. Singhania, 49, took
off from Biggin Hill in Kent on Aug. 18.
   The red-and-white fiberglass aircraft flew 6,000 miles through
high winds and sandstorms and over hundreds of miles of open sea.
Singhania said he fought depression, heat sores and a steady weight
loss in the hours spent in the cramped cockpit of the cone-shaped
plane.
   The 21-feet long plane has a one-half-horsepower engine and a
wingspan of 32 feet. Its top speed is about 60 mph.
   ``Flying at 10,000 feet over the Mediterranean, I saw ships and
tried to visualize how long it would take for them to pick me up if
I fell in,'' the bespectacled, balding industrialist said at the
airport.
   ``I had a lifejacket strapped on, shark repellent by my side and
kept talking to my granddaughter's picture that was strapped on to
the front of my cockpit to keep myself from going crazy.''
   He said he lost 24 pounds during the trip.
   Singhania, the head of India's third-largest business group,
beat a 34-day speed record set over the same course this year by a
British television journalist, Brian Milton.
   Milton was in New Delhi to greet Singhania at the end of the
flight.
   ``There have been only five long flights (above 5,000 miles)
undertaken in a microlight aircraft,'' he said. ``Anyone who
attempts such a flight will have to beat Vijay to make the record.''
   The plane is named L'Espirit d'Indian Post, after a Bombay-based
newspaper owned by the Singhania group. Singhania said the name was
a combination of his ``two passions'' _ the spirit of adventure and
his newspaper.
   ``I wanted to try and break the record. I wanted to be an
ambassador for my country and show people India is not just a
country of snake charmers,'' he said.
   ``I am very proud to have established India on the aviation map
and feel tremendously thrilled that I managed to so positively
portray the indomitable spirit latent in all men, the spirit of
adventure,'' Singhania said.
   ``And not least of all, I was running out of stories to tell my
grandchildren _ now I have a fund of tales.''

<HEAD>Bush Hints at New Policies to Win Over Women, Conservative
Democrats</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS pvs 3rd graf bgng, After a weekend, to CORRECT, reading

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following a political road map to battleground
states, Republican George Bush is zigzagging across America on a
made-for-television tour hinting at new policies to win support
from women and conservative Democrats.
   He concentrated last week on pivotal states _ California, Texas,
Illinois and Pennylvania _ in his quest for the 270 electoral votes
needed to capture the White House, and made passes through
Washington, Oregon and Kentucky.
   After a weekend resting in Washington, Bush returns to the
campaign trail Monday after announcing a national security advisory
task force that will include former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger, former U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Brent
Scowcroft, former White House national security adviser.
   A surprise name on the list, according to campaign sources, will
be Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was President Carter's national
security adviser.
   From Washington, Bush will head for some major industrial states
on an itinerary that includes New Jersey, Illinois, Missouri,
California and Ohio before he returns home by Friday.
   ``I mean to win this election,'' a newly energized Bush
repeatedly declared against highly telegenic backgrounds. At each
event, campaign aides carefully checked camera angles to give
photographers and television cameramen the best shots.
   With public opinion surveys showing him edging ahead of Democrat
Michael Dukakis, Bush seemed more confident and at ease on the
stump. He rejected charges that he was waging a negative campaign.
   His campaign message was tailored to fit the place and the
audience.
   Wooing conservative Democrats in East Texas, Bush was a
hardliner on abortion, the death penalty, gun control and prison
furloughs. He pounced on Dukakis again for vetoing a bill aimed at
requiring public school teachers to lead students in reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   Attacking Dukakis as ``a card-carrying member of the ACLU'' and
``a progressive, liberal Democrat,'' Bush said, ``It's time to have
a Texan in the White House, one who shares your values.''
   It was a different message that Bush brought to Rockford, Ill.,
for an address Friday before 200 members of the Illinois Federation
of Republican Women.
   Observing that women earn an average 70 cents for every dollar
earned by men, Bush said, ``There's only one amount that a woman
should earn for every dollar earned by a man _ and that is one
dollar.''
   In an apparent departure from the Reagan administration's policy
of opposing parental job leaves, Bush declared, ``We also need to
assure that women don't have to worry about getting their jobs back
after having a child or caring for a child during a serious
illness.'' He did not specify what he had in mind.
   He reiterated in an interview that he opposes abortion except in
cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is threatened.
Significantly, however, he said his opposition to abortion is ``not
a litmus test that everybody has to agree with.'' Most polls show a
majority of Americans are pro-choice.
   In another important election-year shift aimed at winning
blue-collar votes, Bush also signaled he is ready to endorse an
increase in the minimum wage, which has been frozen at $3.35 an
hour for seven years.
   The Democrats already are moving an increase through Congress. A
Senate bill proposes an increase to $4.55 by 1991, while a House
bill proposes $5.05 by 1992.
   ``I'm talking to some of our experts and I'm going to do what's
fair,'' Bush said. He said he would insist on some minimum-wage
differential, perhaps a training wage or a sub-minimum wage for
teen-agers.
   Trying to duplicate President Reagan's success at gaining
coverage on the TV evening news shows, Bush went to great lengths
to appear in colorful settings for the cameras.
   He stained his tie filleting a white sea bass at a wholesale
fish company in San Diego, paraded with Mickey Mouse at Disneyland,
Calif., confronted a jeering union crowd at a Portland, Ore.,
shipyard, watched the fiery destruction of nuclear-missile engines
in Texas and appeared at the Marigold Festival at Pekin, Ill.
   To keep the focus on themes of his choosing, Bush did not hold
any news conferences with the campaign press corps last week. He
ignored a reporter who used a traffic cone as a megaphone to shout
questions.
   Not everything went Bush's way, though.
   In Louisville, Ky., Bush flubbed by telling an American Legion
convention that Sept. 7 _ instead of Dec. 7 _ was the anniversary
of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
   Another embarrassment was the disclosure that Jerome Brentar,
co-chairman of the Bush '88 Coalition of American Nationalities,
was a defender of former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who was
convicted in Israel as a Nazi war criminal. Brentar resigned under
fire.

   Hundreds of radical students yelling
slogans against the Olympics and the United States battled riot
police with firebombs and rocks Saturday.
   About 2,000 students from a dozen colleges took part in a rally
at Seoul's Yonsei University to denounce the Olympics and President
Roh Tae-woo's government.
   Many shouted ``Yankee go home.'' Some burned an effigy of an
American wearing the Stars and Stripes.
   ``Oppose the Olympics that squeeze out the blood of the
masses,'' shouted a radical leader as protesters chanted slogans
against the Games, scheduled to begin in Seoul Sept. 17.
   Police said they had no reports of arrests or injuries. Students
also clashed with police at Yonsei Friday in an anti-Olympic
protest.
   Students marched out of the school to confront hundreds of riot
police surrounding the campus in the western part of the city.
   Protesters, some armed with iron and wood clubs, taunted police
and then attacked them with firebombs and rocks.
   ``Oppose the dictatorial Olympics'' and ``Down with the military
dictatorship,'' protesters chanted.
   Waves of masked students rushed out of the school's gates and
climbed over walls to pelt police with firebombs that exploded in
orange balls of blazing gasoline, setting fire to some troopers'
shields and clothing.
   But police did not use tear gas because of a government ban
during the Olympics. Police also hurled back fewer rocks than
normal in an apparent attempt to limit violence.
   Police charged the protesters a few times, but remained on the
defensive most of the time. The fighting lasted about 30 minutes
and was confined to the road in front of the school.
   Radical students have called for widespread anti-Olympic
protests, but they have been confined to a few campuses in Seoul
and some other cities. There have been no demonstrations near the
Olympic venues.
   Student leaders told a rally before the clash with police that
the Roh government was using the Olympics to solidify authoritarian
rule. The leaders said the Olympics should not be staged unless
they helped to promote democracy.
   ``The Olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime,''
said a statement by the protesters. ``The regime is making all-out
efforts to weaken the people's power.''
   Speakers charged the United States was conspiring with Roh to
continue military rule. The United States has about 42,000 troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   National Assembly Speaker Kim Chae-sun, in a speech Saturday to
the opening session of the legislature's new session, said the
overwhelming majority of South Koreans support the Olympics.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have
virtually no public support. Most South Koreans are critical of
radical protests against the Olympics and want nothing to disrupt
the Games.
   Radical students contend the Roh administration is a front for
continued military rule and say they are determined to topple the
government.
   Roh, a former general who won a presidential election in
December, has introduced broad political reforms and dismantled
authoritarian controls.
   In another development Saturday, aides to former President Chun
Doo-hwan said he canceled plans to attend the opening ceremonies of
the Olympics. Chun has been accused of corrpution by the opposition.
   The aides quoted Chun as saying he did not want to cause trouble
at the Games and would stay away despite government plans to invite
him as an honored guest.
   Olympic organizers have invited Chun as one of South Korea's
three living former presidents, and government officials have said
Chun's role in bringing the Games to Seoul justified the invitation.
   The invitation triggered a strong opposition backlash. Chun, who
seized power with military backing in 1980, has faced a
parliamentary inquiry for alleged corruption and other wrongdoing
during his administration.
   Chun left office in February after a seven-year term.

<TEXT>
   Britain on Saturday expelled a Vietnamese diplomat
who brandished a gun outside his embassy during a demonstration by
opponents of the Hanoi government.
   The Foreign Office said Vietnamese Third Secretary Khang Than
Nhan must leave Britain by midnight Sunday. The Vietnamese Embassy
said no official would be available to comment during the weekend.
   Vietnamese Ambassador Tran Van Hung, pressed by the British
government about Khang's actions during the Sept. 4 protest, turned
over a toy gun on Thursday.
   But on Saturday he produced a real gun and gave it to the
British Foreign Office. Tran acknowledged that Khang was holding
the gun when he confronted demonstrating Vietnamese refugees in
front of the embassy, the Foreign Office said.
   Tran told the Foreign Office that his government regretted the
incident and recognized that it constituted a breach of British and
Vietnamese regulations.
   But Tran said that in keeping with Vietnam's invariable
practice, the embassy would not grant a waiver of Khang's
diplomatic immunity to enable Britain to prosecute him.
   On Thursday, the Vietnamese ambassador initially agreed that
Khang would give up his immunity.
   The Foreign Office said Britain would not accept nomination of a
successor to Khang until it received a full account of the
disciplinary proceedings Khang would face.
   At the Sept. 4 embassy incident, demonstrators took photographs
of Khang, which were published in London's Daily Express.
   The Foreign Office said last week it took a very serious view of
the incident and warned the ambassador of the ``gravest
consequences'' unless the diplomat's immunity was waived.
   Diplomatic missions in Britain are not allowed to keep arms, and
the government has taken violations seriously since a gunman firing
from the Libyan Embassy killed a London policewoman during a
demonstration in April 1984.
   After a police siege of the embassy, the building was closed and
diplomatic relations severed.

<TEXT>
   Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, leader
of the New Cinema movement and one of Brazil's top directors, died
early Saturday after a long battle with lung cancer, his family
said.
   Andrade, best known for ``Macunaima,'' was 56.
   In the mid-60s, Andrade and other young Brazilian directors,
including Glauber Rocha, Roberto Farias and Paulo Cesar Saraceni,
founded the Cinema Novo movement, a turn away from traditional
Hollywood films toward a frank depiction of the country's
sociological and political problems.
   Andrade was about to start filming ``Masters and Slaves,'' a $4
million Brazilian-European co-production based on the book by
Gilberto Freire.

   An Iranian man who set himself on fire
during a demonstration against the execution of dissidents in Iran
died Saturday.
   Mehrdad Imen, 32, a registered alien from Los Angeles, died at
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he was admitted
Friday.
   Imen set himself ablaze across from the U.N. Headquarters
building about noon Friday as hundreds of Iranians demonstrated in
a nearby park.
   The rally was organized by the People's Mujahedeen, an Iranian
group seeking the overthrow of the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   Imen was well known in the Iranian community as an anti-Khomeini
activist, but was not a member of the People's Mujahedeen, the
group's spokesman, Mohammed Sedaghat, said Saturday in a telephone
interview from Washington.
   Imen flew to New York from Los Angeles on Friday with other
Iraians to join in the demonstration, Sedaghat said.
   ``This was the action of a man who was moved to this extent and
(whose) feelings obviously could not be restrained,'' Sedaghat said.

<HEAD>Cartoonist Gary Larson to Take 14-Month Break</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cartoonist Gary Larson, whose ``The Far
Side'' comic appears in more than 800 newspapers, will take a
14-month break from his work beginning this fall, his syndicate
said Saturday.
   ``Even revolutionaries need to refuel,'' Universal Press
Syndicate president John McMeel said.
   Larson, 38, who lives in Seattle, will stop distributing new
cartoons Oct. 30 and will begin again Jan. 1, 1990.
   Larson, who has said in the past that he sits down at his
drawing table and ``gets silly,'' is famous for cartoons about cows
that honk at humans, dinosaurs that smoke and woman with beehive
hairdos.
   In one cartoon showing a step in evolution, three fish, one
carrying a baseball bat, prepare to step from the sea for the first
time to retrieve a baseball sitting on the shore.
   In another, a rattlesnake with a pointer in its mouth lectures a
class of other snakes, showing them a chart of a man's leg with a
boot. The bare part of the leg is marked ``OK,'' and the boot is
marked ``No good.''
   During Larson's hiatus, Universal Press will distribute more
than 1,000 cartoons he drew in the early 1980s and that were
published in about 30 newspapers, McMeel said.
   ``Selections from this earlier material will be made available
for the 14-month leave,'' McMeel said, including six black and
white cartoons a week and a color strip on Sunday.
   During his time off, Larson wants to rest and travel, said
spokeswoman Diane Galante. She said he currently is on a trip
outside the country.
   A collection of Larson's cartoons organized by the Smithsonian's
Natural History Museum has been touring U.S. museums the last two
years and collections of his cartoons have consistently been on the
best-selling charts.
   In 1983, another Universal Press cartoonist, Garry Trudeau, took
a 21-month leave from his ``Doonesbury'' strip to update his
characters and work on a Broadway play.
   The syndicate, based in Kansas City, also distributes the
cartoons ``Cathy,'' ``Calvin and Hobbes,'' and ``Ziggy,'' and
several columnists including Dear Abby.

   Faced with $1 million-a-day fines and
layoffs of hundreds of municipal workers, the City Council approved
a court-ordered housing desegregation plan Saturday after two
members switched their votes.
   As an emotional crowd looked on, the council approved the plan
by a 5-2 vote about 1:30 a.m., after a month in which escalating
fines for refusing to endorse the plan threatened the state's
fourth-largest city with bankruptcy.
   Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, head of the state board that
took control of the city's finances, suspended the layoffs of 447
city employees after the vote.
   ``This morning, the healing process begins,'' she said. ``A new
chapter in the history of Yonkers can and must begin.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said the council ``did the right thing.''
   Two of the four councilmen who had long opposed the plan voted
for it after city officials negotiated a modified plan with the
NAACP that would mix some of the low-income units ordered by the
court with more expensive ones.
   City officials planned to ask U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand
to adopt the modified plan in place of his original order, which he
had enforced with fines that hit $1 million a day Friday.
   The vote came as opposition to Sand's plan was starting to wane.
Uncollected garbage sits outside many homes, children went to
school without crossing guards, and the three town libraries were
scheduled to close.
   ``In the past, we have thought of those fines somewhat in the
abstract. ... The abstract has now become a reality,'' said
Councilman Nicholas Longo, one of those who changed his vote. ``The
thing that most affected me was looking over a list of people who
at the stroke of midnight would become unemployed.''
   Longo and Peter Chema, the other councilman who switched,
prefaced their vote with long speeches in which they noted that
Sand had said he would not agree to any changes in the plan unless
the council first approved it unchanged.
   One woman yelled ``You little snake!'' at Chema, while another
man screeched at Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko, ``You sold us out, Nicky!
We'll remember!'' The mayor also voted for the plan.
   After the vote, about 100 spectators noisily filed out of the
council chamber, some cheering, some cursing.
   ``I think they sold our constitutional rights out,'' yelled
Walter Roland. Another resident, Michael Duffy, said, ``It's
wonderful for the city of Yonkers to be in compliance and following
the law.''
   The fines had started at $100 and doubled each day, reaching a
cumulative total of more than $1.6 million paid through Thursday.
   The desegregation lawsuit was brought by the Justice Department
in 1980 and joined by the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People. Three years ago Sand ordered an end to
segregated housing and schools in Yonkers.
   On Aug. 2, he found the city of 194,000 in contempt for the
council's refusal to carry out a housing desegregation order.
   The housing plan calls for 200 units of low-income public
housing scattered through mainly white neighborhoods and 800 units
of middle-income, subsidized housing.
   Councilmen Henry Spallone and Edward Fagan Jr. continued to
oppose the plan and voted against it.
   Sand had threatened all four defiant council members with fines
and jail terms for contempt, but the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the
action earlier this month.
   Jack O'Toole, president of the anti-plan Save Yonkers
Federation, said Saturday his group had hired a lawyer and would
continue to fight the plan.

   Jack Matson's first class assignment
will be to have his University of Michigan Business School students
laugh as ridiculously as they can. Later, they will confront
humiliation.
   Then, when things go wrong in later life, Matson said, ``They'll
understand those are natural, normal sensations and by knowing
that, they'll be more confident to forge ahead.''
   Matson, a University of Houston engineering professor, is on
loan to the business school for the 1988-89 academic year.
   His ``Failure 101'' course was selected from among 158
competitors for the Zell-Laurie Fellowship visiting professorship,
intended to develop courses to foster entrepreneurship.
   It is based on a series of ``hurdle-jumping exercises'' that
confront students with repeated failures.
   Matson, 46, said the idea sprang from unusual events in his own
life. At 40, he was hit in the head by a bolt of lightning while
playing tennis, and that freed him from a ``straitjacketed''
academic life, he said.
   ``There was nothing wrong with me physically, but
psychologically I still felt dead,'' he said. He decided he was
having a midlife crisis and began exploring his creativity.
   ``I started to feel that success is somewhat predicated on a
nest of failures. That's how we learn. If we really want to
succeed, we have to take risks,'' he said.
   In his first class, on Monday, Matson plans to conduct a contest
to see which student can produce the most ridiculous laugh. He
wants to create a spontaneous, playful atmosphere.
   ``I want to teach them how to generate ideas, and bring out
these things that are inside of them, but have been suppressed
during their entire academic careers'' because of fear of failure,
he said.

   What John Mullan and Thomas Lopes found
beside the road was literally a windfall, but they didn't hesitate
to get it back to its proper owner.
   The two state public works department employees found $6,100 in
cash in a blue nylon briefcase alongside a road here Wednesday and
promptly turned it over to police.
   Harry W. Turner of East Falmouth was carrying the money to buy a
boat when the bag blew out the window of his vehicle, said State
Trooper James Mattaliano.
   ``He didn't notice, I guess,'' Mattaliano said. ``He was very
happy to get it back.''
   Mullan and Lopes said they didn't have to think about what to do
with the money after they stopped and picked up the briefcase.
   After realizing it contained 61 hundred-dollar bills, ``we
looked at each other and started laughing, then turned the truck
around and took the bag to state police,'' Mullan said Thursday.
   ``It was hilarious,'' he said. ``You read about it in the paper
and never think it's going to happen to you.''
   Lopes, who at 62 is set to end a 28-year career with the
department in December, said he and his partner ``wanted to feel
good about doing the right thing.''
   ``We worried about the people who had lost it, figuring they
would get excited,'' Mullan said. ``It wasn't our nature to keep
it.''

<HEAD>Another 4,000 Jobs Go; Incredible Shrinking Airline?</HEAD>

   Money-losing Eastern Airlines eliminated 4,000 more
jobs Saturday in the ``downsizing'' it says it needs to survive,
but the unions charged that the cutbacks are actually making the
airline less competitive.
   The cuts, which are being contested in court by the unions,
reduced Eastern's workforce to fewer than 30,000. Less than four
years ago, it had 42,000 workers.
   Eastern eliminated 12 percent of its routes two weeks ago,
ending service to 14 cities.
   Laid-off workers with seniority can transfer to other cities,
``bumping'' newer employees out of their jobs. Thus, newer
employees could take the brunt of the layoffs when the bumping is
complete.
   The mood around work gates was sullen.
   ``We've had very few who have already gotten their layoff
notices, but we've heard there are about 80 who have shown
intentions of bumping,'' said Don Boyd, a union chief steward
representing ramp agents. ``So a lot of these people don't know
what to expect.''
   ``The people are devastated,'' said Charles E. Bryan, president
of the Machinists local, Eastern's largest union with nearly 12,000
members. ``It's a traumatic thing to lose your job when you've just
gotten your children started in school.''
   Of the 4,000 jobs eliminated, 1,500 were non-union positions,
including management and clerical.
   Among the 4,000 are few hundred flight attendants, mechanics,
baggage handlers and ramp agents who are taking early retirement or
quitting, Eastern said.
   ``The fact is we have lost over a billion dollars in this
decade,'' said Robin Matell, the company's chief spokesman. ``We
have to take prudent, although admittedly painful, measures.''
   Eastern, which lost $182 million in 1987 and $149 million in the
first half of 1988 and is $2.5 billion in debt, estimates it will
save $100 million a year with the latest cuts.
   Eastern was taken over more than two years ago by Houston-based
Texas Air Corp.
   Union members have accused Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo of
stripping Eastern's assets in favor of Texas Air's sister airline,
Continental, which has been non-union since Lorenzo took it into
bankruptcy reorganization in 1983.
   The unions say downsizing the carrier dooms Eastern to
decreasing ability to compete. Laying off employees drives up labor
costs per flight because less-senior workers being laid off are
paid less than those who remain, they said.
   ``The last thing you want to do in the airline industry is
downsize,'' Bryan said. ``Many of the costs are fixed, and the
break-even yield goes way up. It's a lose-lose proposition that
just feeds on itself.
   ``Frank Lorenzo is using typical robber baron strategy to
plunder the company and try to make all the cash he can.''
   Eastern's unions will argue against the layoffs later this month
in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, which allowed Eastern
to cut the jobs if it posted a $4.7 million bond to cover wages if
workers are later reinstated.
   The appeals court earlier his month set aside an injunction by
U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker, who had barred Eastern from
eliminating the jobs without negotiating with its unions.
   Machinists' members will vote Thursday on a management demand
for $161 million in cuts. The union and Eastern have been in
federal mediation since January.

<TEXT>
   Hays Kirby refused to be run off by
the sheriff when his town was ordered evacuated, but he realizes
that nearby forest fires might succeed where the law failed.
   The owner of the 20-room Grizzly Lodge just to the east of
Yellowstone National Park's northeast entrance has watched forest
fires burn to the north, south and east of this mountain hamlet.
Saturday, he waited for flames from the Storm Creek fire some three
miles to the west to be fanned into Silver Gate.
   ``We're going to burn up. They can't stop this fire,'' Kirby,
45, said Saturday while finicky breeze whipped the American flag
outside his front door. ``If the wind blows, we're going to blow
up.''
   Forecasts of wind blowing up to 60 mph had been dropped,
although meteorologists still said gusts to 40 mph were possible.
   But a steady rain fell at mid-day.
   Forest fires have charred more than 1 million acres _ 300,000
acres on Friday alone _ in Yellowstone National Park and its
surrounding national forests since late June.
   To Kirby, a wiry man who flies F-16 fighters in the Air Force
Reserve and who has made this tiny community home for eight years,
the fires are an unnecessary tragedy.
   ``This fire laid up in a place we call Lake Abundance for days
and days, and you could have driven ... you could have driven fire
trucks in there and put this fire out,'' he said.
   But Lake Abundance is in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness Area
in Custer National Forest just north of Silver Gate. Machinery is
not allowed in wilderness areas and natural fires are allowed to
burn without man's interference.
   Since it left the wilderness area, firefighters have been unable
to halt the fire.
   A backfire started last week to eliminate fuel between Silver
Gate and the Storm Creek fire reversed directions and burned east
along the ridge running east and west above Silver Gate and Cooke
City. Several homes and outbuildings were destroyed by the flames.
   ``There was no necessity for burning these communities up,''
Kirby said again.
   Since mid-August, these two sleepy towns that funnel summertime
tourists in and out of Yellowstone and winter sportsmen into the
surrounding mountains have acted mainly as fire camps.
   About 100 people call Silver Gate and Cooke City home throughout
the year, but the fires have brought 450 to 500 men and women in to
fight the fires. The Storm Creek fire camp just to the east of
Cooke City holds an additional 1,100.
   ``I live here. My life is here, my family is here,'' said Kirby,
who believes he and his immediate family are the only full-time
Silver Gate residents who have held their ground. ``I just couldn't
leave. I just ... I don't know. I really thought that we could get
a handle on this fire.''
   While some other residents had come back, he said, they were
ordered to leave quickly.
   ``They (the authorities) came in and were going to remove them
from their homes at gunpoint. Oh yes, absolutely, at gunpoint if
necessary,'' Kirby said. ``Montana law, to my knowledge, does not
allow for that. I know they've looked for me quite a lot. I just
haven't been available.''
   In nearby Cooke City, Phyllis and Bernie Kiley have been able to
stay to run their store, the Yellowstone Trading Post.
   The Kileys could lose everything they've worked for the past 17
years if the Storm Creek fire hits them. Their investment in the
trading post is about $250,000, and their adjoining home is worth
about $100,000. Their fire insurance won't come close to covering
the losses, they say.
   ``I guess we're naive,'' Mrs. Kiley said. ``The park
(Yellowstone) wouldn't let us burn because they put us in this
situation. Besides, we couldn't pack it all up and take it.''

   Sheriff Gervase Thompson was a little
embarrassed after discovering his radio campaign advertisements
were made by a fugitive being sought by his department on an
outstanding warrant.
   According to court records, Mark Moody, an ex-disc jockey and
resort operator, was being sought on felony theft and misdemeanor
obstruction of justice charges when he recorded several radio ads
for Thompson this week.
   ``I thought it was all settled,'' the Juneau County sheriff said
Friday. ``I thought he had worked things out with the district
attorney and the court.''
   Thompson said Saturday that authorities had been informed Moody
had moved to Nevada and thus should not be considered a fugitive.
   ``The district attorney's office knew where Mark was. Mark was
not a fugitive,'' Thompson said. ``He left Juneau County apparently
some time before any paperwork was issued.''
   But a bench warrant was issued for Moody on Aug. 16, after he
failed a second time to appear on the charges in a 4-year-old theft
case.
   According to the criminal complaint signed by Thompson, Moody
confessed in June to taking a safe from the Port O' Call Resort
that he and his father, Jerry Moody, operated on Castle Rock Lake
in 1984.
   The younger Moody had initially reported that the safe and its
contents, valued at more than $3,000, had been taken during a
burglary.
   Thompson, who faces a re-election challenge in Tuesday's
primary, said he did not pay Moody for the radio spots, which aired
for the first time Friday.
   Juneau County District Attorney Jonathan Lindberg said Moody has
volunteered to turn himself in Monday.

   An apple a day may keep the doctor
away, but communities hoping to lure physicians to their small
towns passed out the tempting fruit at the 10th annual Doctors Fair
at the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine.
   ``I guess we're feeling like an apple a day keeps the doctor at
home or something,'' said John Record, an assistant dean at the
medical school who organized the fair.
   The medical students and residents who trekked through the tent
adjacent to the school last week could get information about jobs
and incentive packages offered by towns like Sandwich, Ill.;
hospitals in larger communities like Peoria; and even the U.S. Army.
   Dr. Ron Johnson, a former SIU med school student who was lured
to the west-central Illinois community of Pittsfield partly because
of the doctors fair, said he returned to the fair this year to get
assistance.
   ``I'm dying for help,'' said Johnson, a family practitioner. He
said he is the only doctor who delivers babies in Pike County,
population 19,000, and works as many as 110 hours a week.
   ``On the third day that you go to the hospital before your kids
get up and get home after they're in bed, it gets real hard to go
to work,'' he said.
   They weren't just handing out apples at the fair. Medical
students, residents or physicians hoping to change jobs could pick
up an armful of brochures as well as such trinkets at coffee mugs,
visors, candy, cookies, note pads, key chains or even roses to pin
on a lapel.
   ``We give one to all the students and hope that they think we're
a class-act hospital,'' said Ray Marmorstone, administrator at St.
Francis Hospital in Litchfield, population 7,200.
   Representatives from Sandwich Community Hospital offered fake
$100 bills beneath a sign that said ``Come to where the money is.
Sandwich, Illinois.''
   The hospital was offering doctors an incentive package that
includes a guaranteed $100,000 salary for the first year as well as
free office space, paid malpractice insurance and loans for office
equipment.
   ``I talked to one individual who just said how he would pay off
my student loans. ... They'd give me two years free rent in some
office building,'' said fourth-year SIU medical student Mark
Zenker, 25.
   ``When you're about $40,000 in debt, you kind of think of a few
things like that,'' he said.
   Dr. Leslie Page, a resident at SIU, said there was a lot of
interest in her specialty _ obstetrics and gynecology, apparently
because so many physicians are leaving that field because of
spiraling malpractice insurance costs.
   ``I just had a man who said I was golden anytime, anywhere,''
she said.
   Tom Wallhaus, a third-year medical student, said he had no
qualms about starting his career in a small town.
   ``It's kind of tempting to think that you're going to be the guy
in charge of the medicine in some town,'' he said. ``That's
tempting.''

   Pope John Paul II on Saturday accused
South Africa and other forces of destablizing the region,
criticized apartheid and called for the release of black
nationalist Nelson Mandela.
   The Roman Catholic leader, at the start of a 10-day tour of
southern Africa, also urged the people of the region to renounce
violence.
   ``Powerful political, economic and ideological forces endanger
the still fragile stability of countries which are only beginning
to consolidate their recently acquired independence,'' the pope
said in an arrival speech. ``Those forces impede the
self-determination of peoples, they foment ideological, ethnic and
tribal conflicts, they delay the process of development.''
   The pope did not mention any country by name, but he said his
comments were ``true for the grave issue of apartheid,'' South
Africa's policy of racial segregation. He told journalists
accompanying him on the papal flight from Rome that apartheid was
``a racist ideology.''
   Hundreds of Zimbabweans cheered wildly as the pope appeared at
the door of his Air Alitalia Boeing 747, descended a stairway and
kneeled to kiss the soil in his traditional arrival gesture.
   Later, thousands of waving and cheering people stood along the
pope's motorcade route from Harare International Airport to
downtown.
   At the airport, President Robert Mugabe, one of the nearly 1
million Catholics in this country of 8.5 million people, waited at
the edge of a red carpet to greet the pope.
   Traditional dancers and church choirs gave John Paul a festive
welcome to start his 39th tour abroad and fourth visit to Africa
since he became head of the Roman Catholic Church 10 years ago.
   The pope's three-day trip to Zimbabwe is the first stop on the
his five-nation tour of southern Africa, his first visit to the
politically troubled region. The other countries he will visit are
Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique.
   The five countries are among the youngest in Africa, and
8-year-old Zimbabwe is the youngest. The southern states oppose
white-led South Africa's racial segregation policy, but must depend
on the economically and militarily powerful neighbor for economic
survival.
   The Pretoria government asked John Paul to include South Africa
on his current tour, but the invitation was rejected.
   Even though he is avoiding South Africa, the tour is expected to
be one of the most politically charged trips by John Paul, the most
widely-traveled pope in history.
   Speaking to reporters aboard the plane taking him to Zimbabwe,
the former white-ruled British colony of Rhodesia, the 68-year-old
pontiff expressed hope that a future papal trip to South Africa
would trigger changes. But he said no date had been set for such a
trip.
   He also stopped short of endorsing an American sanctions bill
that mandates disinvestment by U.S. companies from South Africa and
a near-total trade embargo.
   After his Zimbabwe speech, John Paul told bishops from the
region, gathered at a Dominican convent, that he prayed every day
for the release of Mandela.
   Mandela, the 70-year-old leader of the African National
Congress, has refused to sign a statement renouncing use of
violence as a condition for his release from South African
detention.
   ``I ask for his freedom every day ... It must take place ... I
am full of admiration for him. I am proud of his firmness,'' he
said.
   The ANC is the major guerrilla group fighting the South African
government.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The pope also told the bishops that ``only a negotiated
settlement of differences can bring true peace and justice'' in
South Africa.
   ``A loss of confidence in the possibility of a peaceful solution
could easily lead to further frustration and violence, increasing
the threat to peace, not limited to this region,'' he said.
   He endorsed the U.S.-mediated regional peace talks between
Angola, Cuba and South Africa that seek the departure of 50,000
Cubans from Angola and have led to the withdrawal of South African
troops involved in the 13-year-long civil war.
   The talks also seek to bring independence to South-West Africa,
known as Namibia.

   The Chamber of Deputies on Saturday confirmed
Carlos Salinas de Gortari as president-elect after bitter protests
by opponents who charged he won through massive fraud.
   Leftist deputies chanted ``Electoral fraud! Electoral fraud!''
as they walked out of the all-night session that ended in a 263-85
vote for Salinas.
   Almost all the votes to certify the results of the July 6
election came from members of Salinas' ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
   ``In no way is he the president of the Mexicans,'' said Octavio
Moreno, a deputy of the opposition Democratic Front.
   After his confirmation, Salinas accepted congratulations from
supporters at his office, telling them, ``Thanks. Onward,'' as he
shook their hands.
   ``Mexico has to grow again and will grow again, because it's the
only way to raise our countrymen's standard of living,'' he told
reporters.
   Salinas begins his six-year presidential term on Dec. 1,
succeeding President Miguel de la Madrid.
   The raucous scene in the chamber capped 3{ weeks of stormy
debate over the election results, during which the PRI brushed
aside claims of ballot fraud.
   In the elections, the opposition, made up of the leftist
Democratic Front and the rightist National Action Party, made its
strongest gains ever in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. But
critics claim that only massive cheating allowed the PRI to retain
its 59-year grip on power.
   At the Saturday morning session of the Chamber of Deputies,
Democratic Front delegates walked out before PRI delegates pushed
through a roll call confirming the official election results and
cutting off debate.
   During the vote, PRI supporters shouted ``Salinas, Salinas,
Salinas.'' National Action delegates walked out after voting ``no.''
   The election was declared valid, with Salinas winning 50.74
percent of the vote, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Front
31.06 percent and Manuel Clouthier of National Action 16.81 percent.
   The PRI and the government have consistently rejected opposition
charges that the elections were fraudulent.
   ``What they are seeking is to destabilize the government and
degrade the republic, its institutions and its politics,'' a PRI
statement said as the confirmation session began Friday.
   Cardenas, leader of a democratic reform movement, said the
confirmation session was the last chance for the PRI and the
government to set a fraud-tainted election right.
   ``PRI lost all its opportunities to legitimize the election,''
said Moreno, a delegate from the state of Mexico. He called Salinas
a ``usurper.''
   In mid-August, the 500-member chamber began its session as an
electoral college to certify the winners of the legislative
elections. On Friday, the delegates began the process of certifying
the winner of the presidential race.
   Salinas was the architect of an austere economic policy that
successfully fought inflation and helped the nation recover from
near bankruptcy, but also devastated the average Mexican's buying
power.
   A crowd of opposition supporters who gathered outside the
Legislative Palace slowly dispersed after the vote.
   Cardenas and Clouthier said they plan to lead more
demonstrations next week, when Mexico celebrates the anniversary of
its independence from Spain.
   ``Until now, we haven't gone as far as the people want,'' said
Moreno. He refused to elaborate.

   Heavy rains pushed flood waters to
higher levels Saturday, and authorities struggled to get food and
medicine to millions of people marooned by the record deluge.
   In the countryside, almost 185,000 people have become sick with
diarrhea after drinking contaminated water and more than 110 of
them died, government health officials said.
   The flood waters covering three-quarters of the country have
swept away houses and people, claiming more than 1,451 lives in the
past month, according to newspaper reports. The government reports
630 deaths, but its figures are considered too low.
   At least 700,000 people from the countryside have taken refuge
in Dhaka, a city of 6 million that is half inundated by the waters
of the Buriganga River. A few cases of diarrhea also were reported
in Dhaka, where flood waters have seeped through leaking
underground pipes into the drinking water supply.
   Health officials estimated that 40 million gallons of raw sewage
are being pumped every day into the city's stagnant flood waters,
where children play and though which adults wade to get relief food
supplies.
   Diarrhea can kill by robbing the body of critically important
substances such as sodium, potassium and magnesium. The fluid loss
associated with diarrhea can lead to sudden collapse of the blood
vessels, and loss of bicarbonates can turn the body's internal
fluids to acid, disrupting normal metabolism.
   The government is trying to deliver food and medicine to
millions of people stranded in remote areas of the country. Many
others have been moved to temporary shelters after their houses
were washed away.
   The waters of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers, which flow
from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, remained at their highest
levels in 34 years, though they did not rise Saturday, according to
officials at Dhaka's Flood Control Center.
   But they said the tributaries of the two rivers rose by a few
inches Saturday. New floods have hit 12 of the country's 64
districts where river waters began to recede last week, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Dhaka airport reopened on Friday after being closed for six
days because of water on the runway.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad said Saturday that the
government was having difficulty delivering medicines and food to
the victims.
   ``We have adequate food and other relief materials,'' the
president told newspaper editors. ``But we do not have the means of
reaching it to all the flood victims.''
   The government has been supplying water purification tablets,
but many people said they had not received any. The floods have
submerged pumps and wells and there is little dry firewood to use
for boiling contaminated water.
   In the Indian state of Assam, rains and flooding have left many
people stranded, the United News of India news agency reported.
State authorities have asked the federal government for $55 million
for flood relief operations, United News of India said.
   Annual monsoon rains cause yearly floods in Bangladesh, whose
110 million people are among the world's poorest with an average
income of $150 a year.

   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis named a dozen
prominent Democrats as co-chairmen of his presidential campaign
Saturday to serve as strategy advisers and surrogates on the
campaign trail.
   Dukakis called them ``12 of the finest leaders or our party, 12
of the finest leaders of our country.''
   The group includes four senators, two House members, a former
congresswoman, three governors, a mayor and Iowa's secretary of
state.
   ``I'm proud to enter the final eight weeks of this campaign with
a distinguished running mate in Lloyd Bentsen and our 12
distinguished co-chairs,'' the Massachusetts governor told
reporters. ``These co-chairs represent a cross section of the
Democratic Party and a cross section of America.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I welcome their advice on policy and
strategy and we will be proud to have them representing us in our
campaign all across this country,'' he said.
   Named were Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Sam Nunn of
Georgia, John Glenn of Ohio and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland; Reps.
Norman Y. Mineta of California and Bill Richardson of New Mexico,
and former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas.
   Also Govs. Mario Cuomo of New York, Bill Clinton of Arkansas and
Madeleine Kunin of Vermont; Mayor Richard Arrington of Birmingham,
Ala., and Iowa Secretary of State Elaine Baxter.

   With a few phrases under a hot East Texas sun,
Michael Dukakis displayed the combative, aggressive stance that
worried supporters have been beseeching him to display in his
lagging campaign against Republican George Bush.
   At the end of a week filled with calamities and plummeting
polls, the Democratic presidential nominee took on Bush in his
strongest language yet.
   Dukakis compared Bush's attacks, suggesting that he was short on
patriotism and soft on crime, to McCarthyism of the 1950s, and said
the American people could ``smell the garbage.''
   ``He finally went ahead and said what we all feel,'' said Ann
Richards, the blunt-spoken Texas state treasurer and Democratic
convention keynoter. ``You can be statesmanlike only so long, when
a schoolyard bully is pushing everybody around.''
   Campaign aides want Dukakis to keep up his tough talk about Bush
this week while he attempts to follow another piece of their advice
_ to add more specifics to his rhetoric.
   Dukakis plans to outline in greater detail his views on defense
and national security during appearances this week, including one
in Annapolis, Md., where he had sought but failed to win the vice
president's agreement for a foreign policy debate.
   The Massachusetts governor kept up the attack Saturday,
questioning the vice president's judgment in having three senior
advisers who are partners in a Washington lobbying firm that once
represented the Bahamas government for an $800,000 fee. ``In a
Dukakis White House, there will be no back doors for foreign
lobbyists,'' he said.
   Dukakis got an enthusiastic reception at a rally in Commerce,
Texas, on Friday with his tough new response to Bush. Campaign
aides saw the speech as an important move toward lifting Dukakis
out of his perceived slump.
   Dukakis himself was visibly changed after the speech, shedding
his reserved demeanor and draping his arm around a reporter.
   His campaign managers' discomfort over Dukakis' slide in the
polls since the Democratic convention in mid-July has been worsened
by a frustrating campaign kickoff week in which events were
disrupted or canceled, partly because of problems with chartered
planes.
   Democrats voiced alarm at seeing Dukakis drop from a lead of 17
percentage points in post-convention polls to an eight-point
deficit after Labor Day.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., told The New York Times the Dukakis
campaign had only two weeks to turn things around.
   Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa said an overly cautious
strategy of ignoring attacks by Bush caused the decline.
   ``A president has to be an aggressive person,'' Harkin said.
``It's not the kind of world where you want a Caspar Milquetoast in
the White House.''
   Mrs. Richards privately urged Dukakis to move swiftly to try to
regain the offensive.
   ``I talked to him a lot, and I told him, `you don't have to take
that kind of garbage','' she said. ``I think he had to respond.''
   Bush has dominated the presidential campaign since his
nomination in mid-August by carefully selecting and timing his
easily understood attacks on Dukakis' record.
   The vice president seemed to be casting doubt on Dukakis'
patriotism, while denying he was doing so, by making an issue of
the Massachusetts governor's veto of a bill aimed at requiring
public school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the Pledge
of Allegiance. Dukakis said he was advised that the bill was
unconsititutional.
   Dukakis press secretary Dayton Duncan said the governor had
written much of the Texas speech himself. Campaign chairman Paul
Brountas said Dukakis was angered by a pair of news stories during
the week.
   In one, members of a Bush booster organization were disclosed to
have voiced anti-Semitic views. In the other, a lobbying firm
associated with Bush's campaign manager had received $800,000 for
lobbying on behalf of a foreign official involved in a drug
investigation.
   ``He read that and said, `These people are questioning MY
patriotism,'' Brountas said.
   ``He was outraged,'' Duncan said.
   The new conviction behind Dukakis' assault on Bush coincided
with the return of his former campaign manager, John Sasso, who has
a close relationship with the candidate and was warmly welcomed by
other campaign staffers.
   Dukakis' formal campaign kickoff began on a dismal note.
   When he appeared in a Philadelphia neighborhood early Labor Day
morning, anti-abortion protesters clogged one end of the street and
their chants reverberated down the block. A faulty sound system
left Dukakis' words unintelligible. Campaign sources said an
advance man was fired.
   A day later in Chicago, Dukakis' speech was disrupted by
anti-abortion hecklers who determinedly tried to shout him down.
   Things got worse. Dukakis' campaign jet plane was effectively
grounded by a Federal Aviation Administration spot inspection which
began 15 minutes before the scheduled takeoff. The rest of the day
was lost. Press briefings were set up on the run, and contradictory
answers were given to reporters.
   Arriving in Baltimore for a welcome by Maryland Gov. William
Donald Schaefer, the Democratic nominee found there was no ramp at
the front of the plane.
   Nonetheless, Brountas told reporters Friday morning that the
week was ``tops'' for Dukakis. Later in the day, he repeated his
declaration and added, ``Now I can say that with more conviction.''

   Fancied by Herbert Hoover, sold by Jimmy Carter
and ignored by Ronald Reagan, the presidential yacht Sequoia is on
the last leg of a 120-city fund-raising tour before it is returned
to White House control.
   The Sequoia was bought by the Commerce Department from a
Philadelphia family in 1929. After Hoover wintered on the boat in
Florida in 1933, it was acquired by the Navy and declared the
official presidential yacht.
   The 105-foot vessel served eight presidents over a period of 44
years before Carter ordered the ship sold at auction in 1977 as an
austerity move.
   ``The Sequoia is really a symbol of the presidency in the 20th
century,'' said J. Michael McGehee, spokesman for The Presidential
Yacht Trust, the private group that bought the ship and began
restoring it in 1981.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt planned war strategy from the ship, Harry
Truman used it for the first international conference on nuclear
arms control and Richard Nixon held working sessions with the likes
of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev on board, McGehee said.
   The ship was open for public visits over the weekend at the
Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston. It will make more stops along the
Atlantic Coast before it is donated to the Navy on Nov. 15 and
again becomes the presidential yacht.
   The fund-raising voyage has raised $5.5 million, half the $11
million needed for restoration costs and to create an endowment for
future maintenance and operations without taxpayer expense, he said.
   But McGehee said Reagan has failed to stamp his imprimatur on
the project.
   ``This is the ultimate private sector project,'' he said. ``One
would think Ronald Reagan would be willing to hold this up and say,
`This is what I've been talking about.' ''
   Lyndon Johnson used the lure of an afternoon cruise on the ship
to entangle legislators in marathon discussions and hold them
hostage until they came around to his point of view, McGehee said.
   ``We've had some funny stories about senators and congressmen
telling the captain to turn the boat around and go back to dock.
The captain would say he could only listen to his
commander-in-chief.''
   Nixon enjoyed taking cruises on the Potomac in the Sequoia and
announced his decision to resign the presidency to his family
aboard the ship.
   A joint congressional resolution in 1985 provided for the
Sequoia's eventual return, and the ship was designated a National
Historic Landmark earlier this year.
   McGehee said the Presidential Yacht Trust has spent $3.5 million
restoring teak paneling, bleached ash interiors, handmade carpets,
engines and other details. The ship was built for $210,000, but to
build it now would cost between $8 million and $10 million.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Investigation Shows Jetliner Hit By Missile</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Experts have concluded that an Italian
jetliner which mysteriously crashed into a sea eight years ago,
killing all 81 people on board, was shot down by missile, a
newspaper reported.
   British and American experts have been analyzing the recently
salvaged wreckage of the DC-9, which exploded and crashed into the
Tyrrhenian Sea on June 27, 1980.
   The Italian government financed a salvage operation to raise the
fuselage so experts could determine the cause of the disaster.
   The Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera said that British
explosives experts and American engineers at McDonnell Douglas
Corp., the jetliner's manufacturer, have determined the plane was
downed by a missile.
   The paper said the missile exploded seconds before it would have
struck the jetliner. It said the blast destroyed the cockpit,
killed the flight crew, damaged the baggage compartment door on the
right, scorched the outside of the plane and punched three
grapefruit-size holes in the fuselage.
   The same newspaper reported in June that experts were certain
the airliner had been hit by a missile. But a member of the
investigating commission later denied it had reached any
conclusions.
   Corriere della Sera said on Friday that the experts completed
their investigation Thursday and that the results were being
forwarded to Judge Vittorio Bucarelli, who is in charged of the
inquiry.
   The newspaper said the voice recorder on the flight picked up an
undecipherable shout just before the explosion.
   It also said the British experts are still trying to determine
the chemical composition of the explosive as a way to trace the
nationality of the missile.
   The plane was on a flight from Bologna to Palermo, Sicily. It
crashed in the sea 30 miles southwest of Naples, between the
islands of Ponza and Ustica.

   Thirty-four weary Mississippi firefighters
have returned home to rest after ``scary ... but exciting'' work
fighting forest fires in Yellowstone National Park.
   ``I want to go home, take a bath, clean up and see my family I
hadn't seen in 25 days,'' said Mike Melton, 38, of Forest, when
they arrived Friday night.
   Sonja Durrwachter, 29, of Wiggins said she was looking forward
to ``a hot bath and hugging my babies.''
   ``We put in a lot of long hours,'' Durrwachter said. ``We got to
see a lot of fire. We got a lot of experience on fires we don't get
around here. It was scary, but it was real exciting.''
   Crew members averaged 15 hours per day, sometimes working as
long as 19 hours, said crew boss Tony Wilder, 37, of Starkville.
   ``We defended structures around the canyons and the flames that
hit us were 200 feet high. We were in hazard situations most of the
time we were there. It was insane,'' Wilder said.
   ``You could hear the fire coming an hour before it got there,''
Wilder said.
   The Mississippi crew was part of the team that tried to protect
the Old Faithful geyser complex, he said, but the fire ran away
from them and destroyed several buildings.
   Firefighters also had to contend with stubborn animals.
   ``The wildlife offered not only a challenge but a hazard to work
around,'' Wilder said, saying a buffalo wouldn't allow them to
approach one area they wanted to hose down. ``We saw a lot of fresh
bear signs. That was a constant concern.''

<HEAD>Labor Rejects Appeal To Call Off General Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest labor
federation on Saturday rejected a government appeal to call off
another general strike and said the work stoppage will be held to
protest police repression.
   The General Labor Confederation said its unions will hold a
24-hour nationwide strike on Monday.
   It had organized an 8-hour general strike Friday to protest the
gpvernment's economic policies and police used tear gas, rubber
bullets and clubs to disperse about 20,000 demonstrators at a rally
in downtown Buenos Aires.
   ``The Monday strike is unchangeable and there will be no
modification,'' Saul Ubaldini, secretary-general of the labor
federation, told reporters as he arrived at a union meeting to
discuss Friday's violence.
   He said Monday's strike would be ``a peaceful repudiation'' of
police actions Friday.
   Federal police said Saturday that 76 demonstrators and 37
policemen were injured during the disturbances in the Plaza de
Mayo. They reported four civilians and eight policemen were
hospitalized for fractures and cuts.
   Thirteen demonstrators were arrested and face charges of
assault, resisting arrest, arson and vandalism, according to the
report.
   The Interior Ministry had appealed to the labor federation to
reconsider its call for a Monday strike. It said police intervened
in the Buenos Aires rally to halt vandalism and fighting between
rival union groups.
   But Ubdaldini said, ``It's a lie that the incidents began among
participants of the rally.''
   Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia issued a communique saying
violence ``can only benefit small anti-democratic sectors.''
   ``Nothing can justify a new paralyzation of the country that
will only postpone progress without providing any benefit for
rights and freedoms,'' it said.
   Monday's strike will be the 13th organized by the General Labor
Confederation since the elected government of President Raul
Alfonsin and his centrist Radical Civic Union came to power Dec.
10, 1983, ending nearly eight years of military rule. The labor
federation is dominated by the opposition Peronist Party.
   Both Nosiglia and Federal Police Chief Juan Pirker rejected
union charges of police brutality and blamed agitators for the
violence.
   Ubaldini, who fled the platform at the Plaza de Maya rally
Friday in a cloud of tear gas, had described the strike as ``a
peoples' referendum against the plan of hunger and misery that they
(the government) want to impose on us.''
   He referred to an anti-inflation plan introduced by the
government last month that devalued the currency, lifted
restrictions on some imports and called for voluntary wage and
price controls.
   Inflation has registered 255 percent so far this this year and
440 percent during the past 12 months.

   About 100 babies born through in vitro
fertilization techniques at Greater Baltimore Medical Center,
including triplets, returned to the hospital for a reunion Saturday.
   Dr. Theodore Baramki, head of the Division of Reproductive
Endocrinology, said the so-called test-tube program can be credited
with the births of 136 babies _ 74 boys and 62 girls _ since it
began in 1985.
   The program is one of 169 in the country, according to hospital
spokeswoman Vivienne Stearns-Elliott.
   Ms. Stearns-Elliott says 10 mothers enrolled in the program
currently are awaiting the births of triplets as well.
   In vitro fertilization involves stimulating the woman's ovaries
with hormones so she produces more than one egg. Those eggs are
retrieved and combined with sperm in a laboratory dish. The
fertilized eggs then are implanted in the woman's uterus.

<HEAD>Discovery Of Mercury Could Threaten Plans For New Wildlife Refuge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of mercury in freshwater
marshes in eastern New Orleans has complicated plans to turn the
area into the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told city and state officials
Thursday that they discovered quantities of mercury well above
federal health levels near a landfill that has a history of leaking
into the surrounding marshes.
   The city-owned Recovery I landfill is operated by Waste
Management Inc., and a company spokesman denied the landfill was
the source of the mercury contamination.
   The Fish and Wildlife report said it found only mercury, not
pesticides or petroleum hydrocarbons. The report said additional
samples have been taken to confirm the mercury findings, and those
results should be available in October.
   Officials said the mercury contamination poses no immediate
health hazard. The marshland near the landfill is not used for
commercial fishing or hunting, and since mercury is a heavy metal,
it tends to sink and combine with sediment at the bottom of the
marsh.
   Wildlife Service officials already were concerned that about
1,500 acres of marshland near the landfill was depleted of oxygen,
a symptom of chemical and biological contaminants, and was not
supporting wildlife.
   City officials had been negotiating with federal officials to
see if an airport could be constructed near the proposed refuge.
The questions raised by the Wildlife Service test results will slow
down those negotiations, city officials said.
   City officials said they aren't convinced the landfill is the
source of the contamination, and suggested the mercury might be
from a spill from railroad tank cars on tracks that cut across the
property. No such spill has been reported.
   Planning Commission Director Bob Becker said city consultants
also don't understand why the test results turned up no other
contaminants, when a mixture of contaminants would be more likely
to escape from a landfill.
   State Department of Environmental Quality officials said they
will review the Recovery I operating permit, which expires Oct. 17.
   City officials have notified the state that they don't plan to
renew Waste Management's contract to operate the facility, although
Waste Management requested a 10-year extension of its state permit
last year.
   The city wants to put operation of the landfill out to bid, and
has asked the state for a seven-year grace period to continue to
dispose household garbage in the landfill before shutting it down.

   Michael Dukakis lashed out anew at George Bush's
judgment and leadership Saturday, accusing the vice president of
associating with aides who helped the Bahamian government when it
was under drug investigation and others reported to be sympathetic
to Nazis.
   ``My staff will not have divided loyalties,'' the Democratic
presidential nominee said. ``In a Dukakis White House, the staff
will pledge allegiance to only one flag _ Old Glory.''
   Dukakis, spending the weekend off the campaign trail, gave
reporters copies of a memorandum from a Washington lobbying firm
with which several top Bush advisers are associated.
   In the memo, the firm of Black, Manafort & Stone promised to
improve the image of the government of the Bahamas among Reagan
administration officials and Congress.
   The Bahamian government accepted the proposal and paid the
Republican lobbying firm $800,000 between April 1985 and September
1986. The Bahamian prime minister, Lynden O. Pindling, long has
been suspected of involvement with drug traffickers.
   The lobbying firm's memo boasted of the company's influence
within the administration and listed more than a dozen contacts
with Bush's office.
   Three Bush aides and advisers are partners in the firm. They are
Charles R. Black, Paul J. Manafort and Roger J. Stone. All have
strong ties to the Reagan White House in addition to their campaign
roles. Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater also is listed on the
memo, but Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin said Atwater had no
role in the contract.
   ``The measure of a president is the quality and the integrity of
the people with whom he surrounds himself,'' Dukakis told a
statehouse news conference.
   ``The American people have the right to know that the back door
of the White House will not be the front door for paid agents of
foreign governments. In a Dukakis White House there will be no back
doors for foreign lobbyists.''
   The Massachusetts governor said Bush's association with the
Black, Manafort & Stone partners and with campaign aides who have
defended Nazis and Nazi organizations ``raises serious questions
about Mr. Bush's judgment and the kind of people he attracts.''
   Jerome Brentar, co-chairman of The Bush '88 Coalition of
American Nationalities, was a defender of former Ohio autoworker
John Demjanjuk, who was convicted in Israel as a Nazi war criminal.
Brentar resigned under fire.
   ``But Florian Galdau and Philip Guarino (respectively honorary
chairman and vice chairman of the panel) stay on -- despite
revelations of their ties to fascist, pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic
organizations,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., on Saturday,
calling for the two to resign.
   The Philadephia Inquirer reported Saturday that several other
Bush campaign officials have supported Nazis.
   ``I think it says a great deal about that campaign,'' Dukakis
said. ``It says a great deal about the judgment of Mr. Bush.''
   Dukakis used the ``pledge allegiance to only one flag'' line to
counter Bush's attacks on Dukakis for his 1977 veto of a bill aimed
at requiring state public school teachers to lead pupils in
reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Dukakis had been advised the
bill was unconstitutional.
   The House rejected a Republican proposal Friday that each day's
session in that chamber begin not only with a prayer but with the
Pledge of Allegiance, but Speaker Jim Wright said the pledge would
be recited on two mornings next week.
   Dukakis said he had no objection if Congress decided to start
each legislative day with the pledge. He then quickly cited Bush's
official duty as president of the Senate, and said:
   ``To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that the
pledge be part of the regular routine of the Senate. So who's
kidding whom?''
   On Friday, Dukakis likened the Republican attacks on him to
McCarthyism of the 1950s. He stopped short of directly accusing
Bush of such tactics Saturday, but criticized him for not
condemning several unsubstantiated attacks on Dukakis, his wife and
Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``Remaining silent, in my judgment, is not the way you take
responsibility and provide leadership,'' the governor said.
   Dukakis planned to meet Saturday night and Sunday with several
Democratic members of Congress who are experts in national security
and defense matters, including Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia and John
Glenn of Ohio and Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin.
   Those sessions were to help prepare Dukakis to outline his
positions in detail next week on those issues. Republicans have
labeled Dukakis weak and naive in those areas.
   ``I happen to think Mr. Bush is very vulnerable on foreign
policy and national security issues,'' Dukakis said Saturday.
   ``It's a question of judgment, questions of support for
Iran-Contra, Latin-American policy which is failed and illegal,
statements made, failure of execution, a whole series of task
forces which the vice president has been in charge of which have
been absolute failures,'' he said.
   ``I think it's time now that the American people take a good,
hard look at his record.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen turned
up the heat Saturday in a get-tough campaign against Republican
George Bush, who buoyantly prepared for a cross-country tour of
industrial states rich in electoral votes.
   Dukakis, spending the weekend in Boston, accused several of the
vice president's closest aides of using the White House as a ``back
door for foreign lobbyists'' and declared that ``in a Dukakis White
House, the staff will pledge allegiance to only one flag _ Old
Glory.''
   Preceding Bush to Los Angeles, Bentsen inspected evidence of
gang violence _ guns, knives and a bullet-riddled car _ which he
said had increased during the Reagan administration. Bentsen said
Bush had led the war against drugs as vice president and ``blew it
badly.''
   The GOP nominee, elated by an eight-point lead over Dukakis in
public opinion polls, relaxed at his Washington home this weekend
before leaving Monday for appearances in New Jersey, Illinois,
Missouri, California and Ohio.
   Bush also planned to announce the formation of a national
security advisory task force including former Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger, former U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew
Brzezinski, who was President Carter's national security adviser.
   ``I mean to win this election,'' Bush said repeatedly last week.
And Dukakis finally heeded his worried supporters' pleas to take a
more combative, aggressive stance against Bush.
   The Democratic nominee stepped up the attack at a news
conference Saturday in which he denounced the vice president for
employing three senior advisers who also are partners in a
Washington lobbying firm hired by the government of the Bahamas to
improve its image among Reagan administration officials.
   Dukakis released a memo by the firm of Charles R. Black, Paul J.
Manafort and Roger J. Stone which boasted of the company's
influence inside the administration and listed more than a dozen
contacts in Bush's office.
   The firm received $800,000 in 1985 and 1986 from the Bahamian
government. The Bahamian prime minister, Lynden O. Pindling, long
as been suspected of involvement with drug traffickers.
   ``The measure of a president is the quality and the integrity of
the people with whom he surrounds himself,'' Dukakis said. ``The
American people have the right to know that the back door of the
White House will not be the front door for paid agents of foreign
governments. In a Dukakis White House, there will be no back doors
for foreign lobbyists.''
   Dukakis referred to other campaign aides who reportedly have
been sympathetic to Nazis and Nazi organizations, including Jerome
Brentar, who resigned as co-chairman of a Bush campaign
organization for ethnic groups when it was disclosed that he once
defended convicted Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk.
   ``I think it says a great deal about that campaign,'' Dukakis
said. ``It says a great deal about the judgment of Mr. Bush.''
   ``The moral clock is ticking on the Bush campaign,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., on Saturday, calling for the resignations
of Florian Galdau and Philip Guarino, two members of Bush's
Coaliton of American Nationalities who he said had ``ties to
fascist, pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic organizations.''
   Dukakis also twitted Bush, as president of the Senate, for never
proposing that senators recite the Pledge of Allegiance as part of
their legislative business.
   That comment, and his reference to pledging allegiance to only
one flag, was the nominee's response to Bush's frequent criticism
of Dukakis for vetoing a state bill aimed at requiring public
school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the pledge.
Dukakis says he was advised that the bill was unconstitutional.
   Bentsen toured the Los Angeles County Sheriff's ``Operation Safe
Streets'' program in the Carson area, a major site of violent gang
activities, and took the occasion to blast Bush's role in the
administration's anti-drug campaign.
   ``The ultimate irony of the Reagan-Bush popgun war on drugs is
the role of the vice president,'' the Texas senator said. ``They
asked him to lead the battle, and he blew it badly.''
   Bentsen said Bush ``talks tough on crugs, but while he has been
talking, America has lost control of our borders. ... The
unprecedented influx of drugs has turned California's youth gangs
into heavily armed, well-organized, deadly criminal cartels.''
   He added: ``The fact is this administration has botched the war
on drugs. They're trying to fight that battle with eight Cabinet
officers, 26 federal agencies, but only one general _ and his name
is Noriega.'' Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega has been indicted in
the United States for drug trafficking.
   Bentsen's GOP counterpart, Dan Quayle, relaxed at his home in
the Virginian suburbs of Washington, with plans to attend his son's
soccer game. He departs Monday on a campaign swing through
Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Colorado and New Mexico.
   Trying to lay to rest another controversy from his past, the
Indiana senator told reporters Friday that ``I got into law school
fair and square. Nothing improper was done and no rules were
broken.''
   He was responding to questions about a report in The (Cleveland)
Plain Dealer indicating that he entered Indiana University Law
School under a program intended primarily to benefit minority
students.
   The Reagan White House did its part to boost Bush's candidacy on
Saturday.
   In his weekly radio speech, President Reagan said the nation's
schools are improving because for the past eight years, he and Bush
``have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand.'' The
boast immediately drew a denial from Senate Democratic Leader
Robert C. Byrd.
   White House press spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in a television
interview on ``John McLaughlin's One on One,'' said Bush was ``a
very strong leader'' and a personable friend.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of hurricane Florence spread heavy rain over the
South on Saturday, and a cold front ushered cool air and showers
southward along the Rockies.
   The center of what was left of Florence was over southwestern
Mississippi drifting slowly towards the northwest, spreading
showers and thunderstorms over Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and
northwestern Florida.
   A band of thunderstorms from the storm's remains produced heavy
rain and severe weather over northwestern Florida and southern
Alabama. A tornado touched down near Freeport, Fla., in Walton
County, damaging some mobile homes, the National Weather Service
said, and some bridges in Florida's Santa Rosa County were under
water.
   Rainfall totals over southern Alabama ranged from 2 to 6 inches,
with more than 3.50 inches at Montgomery in 24 hours.
   Tropical storm Gilbert was located in the eastern Caribbean
about 400 miles southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. It
was expected to strengthen and move westward Sunday.
   A cold front pushed across the northern Rockies and the area to
the west, marking the leading edge of cooler air with showers and
thunderstorms. Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered over
southwestern Montana and western Wyoming, an earea of severe forest
fires. It was expected to push across sections of Nevada and Utah
and drop temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below normal for this time
of year.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the Florida
Peninsula, South Carolina and Georgia. Thunderstorms also developed
over western North Dakota.
   Mary Esther, Fla., got 1.36 inches of rain in the six hours up
to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Orlando, Fla., posted a record high temperature for the date at
96 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Pullman, Wash., to 103 at Palm Springs, Calif. Saturday
morning's low was 31 at Warroad, Minn.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over the Tennessee Valley, the lower Ohio Valley, most of Illinois,
southeastern Missouri, and northern sections of the lower
Mississippi Valley. A cold front was forecast to spread showers and
some thunderstorms over the northern Plains, the northern Rockies,
and northern sections of the central Rockies. Scattered
thunderstorms were forecast over the southern half of Florida.
   Highs in the 40s and 50s were predicted in Montana and
northwestern Wyoming; in the 60s in western sections of the
northern Plains, central Wyoming, most of Idaho and the northern
half of New England; in the 90s in Florida, southern Alabama and
Georgia, the southern Plains, most of Kansas, the southern Rockies,
parts of the Southwest and the inland valleys of California;
between 100 and 105 over the desert Southwest; and in the 70s and
80s over the remainder of the nation.

^Bentsen Says Bush Headed `Popgun War' Against Drugs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen said Saturday that illegal narcotics flooded the nation
while Vice President George Bush directed a botched ``popgun war''
against drugs.
   ``The vice president talks tough on drugs, but while he has been
talking, America has lost control of our borders,'' the Texas
senator said at an outdoor rally attended by several hundred
supporters.
   ``The ultimate irony of the Reagan-Bush popgun war on drugs is
the role of the vice president,'' Bentsen said. ``They asked him to
lead the battle, and he blew it.''
   He said that after Bush was named head of the drug interdiction
task force in 1983, ``he did so badly that the head of the Drug
Enforcement Agency called for abolishment'' of the program.
   ``On George Bush's watch, the international production of drugs,
the flow of drugs into this country and the use of drugs all
increased dramatically,'' he said.
   Bentsen criticized plans by Republican nominee Bush to have his
vice presidential running mate, Dan Quayle, head a new anti-drug
effort. In a recent newspaper interview, a reporter had to inform
Quayle that Bush had directed the Reagan administration's efforts.
   ``Now he wants to pass the torch of incompetence on to the
junior senator from Indiana who is so disinterested that he didn't
even know that his running mate had been head,'' Bentsen said.
   ``The fact is, this administration has botched the war on
drugs,'' he said. ``They're trying to fight that battle with eight
Cabinet officers, 26 federal agencies, but only one general _ and
his name is Noriega,'' referring to Panamanian leader Manuel
Noriega who is under U.S. indictment for alleged drug trafficking.
   Bentsen promised that a Dukakis administration would name one
person to head the drug eradication effort and ``won't coddle drug
dictators like Noriega.''
   He needled the Bush campain for its ties to lobbyists.
   ``Some of the top lieutenants of the vice president have been
accepting hundreds of thousand of dollars as paid agents of foreign
governments... under investigation today for drug trafficking,'' he
said.
   ``We'll cut off foreign aid to governments that refuse to
cooperate with us in the war on drugs,'' said Bentsen, pledging
increased support for federal anti-drug agencies and more
coordination with local law enforcement officials.
   The Reagan administration has ``tried to slash funds to assist
state and local governments in their drug enforcement efforts,'' he
said.
   ``The unprecedented influx of drugs has turned California's
youth gangs into heavily armed, well organized, deadly criminal
cartels,'' said Bentsen, who earlier visited a Los Angeles area
plagued by gang warfare.
   Accompanied by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Bentsen viewed
knives, guns and a bullet-ridden car as he toured the Carson area
where the Los Angeles County sheriff's office is running an
Operation Safe Streets program.
   Just hours earlier, four people standing in a crowd were shot
from a passing car in what the sheriff's office said was a gang
incident.
   ``When we talk about waging this war, we have a lot more to
do,'' Bentsen said before he was shown military-type assault
weapons, sawed-off shotguns and the other weapons confiscated in
the area.
   As for gun control laws, Bentsen said, ``I think a waiting
period for the purchase of handguns is a reasonable limitation.''
He added that he preferred this be done at a state's option,
indicating he might oppose pending legislation that would impose a
national waiting period.
   Bentsen was making his third trip to California since receiving
the vice presidential nomination in July. He and Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis are planning several return
trips in a bid for the state's 47 electoral votes, the most of any
state.

<TEXT>
   Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's brigantine
Niagara returned to the Great Lakes on Saturday, exactly 175 years
after his fleet defeated the British in the Battle of Lake Erie.
   ``We are starting a new page in Pennsylvania's history, and you
all are a part of it,'' Gov. Robert Casey told an estimated 5,000
people gathered for the launching ceremony.
   Casey's wife, Ellen, lifted a bottle of Erie County wine and
struck the 182-foot, 278-ton restored ship, bedecked with the
American flag and Perry's battle flag, ``Don't Give Up the Ship.''
The bottle didn't break, however, and she had to strike the ship
again, this time successfully.
   Shortly afterward, a crane lifted the ship into Lake Erie's
Presque Isle Bay. Eighteen cannons fired a military salute, and
more than 200 private boats anchored in the bay to watch the
festivities blared their horns.
   It was the fourth time the ship had been restored, this time
using $3.8 million in state and private funds.
   The restored Niagara will be outfitted by next spring with
118-foot and 113-foot masts, square rigging, about 22,000 square
feet of polyester sail and 20 aluminum cannon.
   It will then tour the Great Lakes and East Coast ports as
Pennsylvania's ``official flagship.''
   The first USS Niagara was one of six small ships built in this
port city during the War of 1812 and put under Perry's command to
break a British blockade of American Great Lakes ports and to
defend the Northwest Territory.
   On Sept. 10, 1813, Perry's nine-ship squadron met six British
vessels under Commodore Robert Heriot Barclay in a short but fierce
battle near Put-in-Bay, Ohio.
   Perry's flagship, the USS Lawrence, was disabled by British
fire. Perry transferred to the Niagara, where he hoisted his famous
battle flag, ``Don't Give up the Ship,'' and attacked again. The
Niagara helped break the British battle line and forced Barclay to
surrender.
   ``We have met the enemy and they are ours: two ships, two brigs,
one schooner and one sloop,'' Perry reported to his superiors.
   The Niagara served as a station ship in Erie until 1820, when it
was scuttled in nearby Misery Bay. The ship was raised by Erie
citizens in 1913 and restored for a Great Lakes tour to celebrate
the 100th anniversary of Perry's victory. The ship was restored
again in the 1930s and 1940s.
   In the latest restoration, Melbourne Smith, an Annapolis, Md.,
marine architect, dismantled the Niagara and rebuilt it to
historical specifications. Forty-two pieces of the original ship
are incorporated in the restored brigantine.

<HEAD>Dwarf Loves Being Tossed Around, Ignores Criticism From Other
Little People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Wilson loves getting thrown
around in dwarf-tossing contests, and shrugs off bitter criticisms
of the practice by associations for little people.
   ``I think it's a lot of fun,'' said the 4-foot-5 human
projectile. ``If Eddie Murphy can make fun of being black, if Dom
DeLuise can make fun of being fat, why not me? Why can't I make fun
of being short?
   ``I'm into it. I'm an entertainer.''
   He also works as a welder and circus entertainer. ``I eat fire,
eat nails, walk on broken glass,'' he said.
   Wilson, 27, is next slated for a show Sept. 13-15 at a downtown
bar, Animal House, with a $1,000 prize for the winner.
   Wilson, who'll be wearing a crash helmet, knee pads and a
harness for contestants to grab, says he'll be rooting for
participants to outdistance the 7-feet, 8-inch distance he was
tossed in a Bradenton bar last summer.
   Dwarfism groups hate the idea.
   ``From the standpoint of little people, it's demeaning,'' said
Robert Van Etten, former president of Little People of America,
which represents about 4,000 dwarfs.
   ``It's mean-spirited. It moves us back to the Dark Ages. It's
poking fun at a minority group,'' said Van Etten, noting that
public outcry helped kill plans for a dwarf-throwing contest in
Chicago in 1985.
   Manatee County Commissioners didn't like the Bradenton dwarf
toss, but couldn't find a law under which they could ban it.
   ``I think we all pretty much felt like it was low-level type of
entertainment,'' said commission Chairman Kent Chetlain. ``It's
like somebody capitalizing on someone's disfigurement or
infirmity.''
   Animal House publicist Richard Levy brushed off such
contentions, saying the contest is fun, attracts customers and is
certain to generate publicity for the bar.
   And Wilson said he makes good money being tossed.
   Dwarf-tossing began as a bar stunt in Queensland, Australia,
said Van Etten's wife Angela, author of ``Dwarfs Don't Live in Doll
Houses.''
   ``It is actually freak show entertainment, the sort of thing you
saw in the 1930s,'' she said. ``The problem with freak show
entertainment is it sets the dwarf apart as something to be stared
out and made fun of, which makes it difficult for the rest of us,
who aren't participating, to be treated as equal.''

consider legalizing the labor group.
   Walesa, key Solidary advisers and other activists gathered in a
Roman Catholic Church to plan their strategy for talks with
authorities on the future of the outlawed labor movement.
   They issued a statement late Saturday saying they wanted
confirmation that authorities are prepared to ``create conditions''
for legalizing Solidarity, which was suspended in 1981 and
subsequently outlawed.
   The weekend conference is one of the largest gatherings of the
Polish opposition in years.
   The meeting Saturday included Solidarity regional leaders and
strike committee members, and a gathering Sunday is to include
intellectuals and cultural figures who advise Solidarity founder
Walesa.
   The group is meeting to discuss the communist government's offer
to enter negotiations. On Aug. 31, authorities agreed to open talks
and Walesa agreed to end a 19-day wave of strikes.
   Andrzej Stelmachowski, a Roman Catholic intellectual acting as a
mediator between the governent and opposition, said he expected the
gpvermment-Solidarity talks would begin in the middle of the week.
Diplomatic sources said they were told the meeting would begin
Sept. 15.
   At the end of Saturday's meeting the Solidarity leadership
released a statement saying: ``We expect a clear expression by the
Polish authorities of readiness to create conditions for legal
functioning of Solidarity.
   ``Only the legalization of Solidarity allows the effective
participation of the union in reforming the country.''
   The statement also demanded an end to reprisals against workers
who had participated in strikes.
   Actions such as detentions, firings and induction of strike
participants into the military ``impair the credibility of the
authorities' proposals,'' it said. ``We expect an immediate end to
repressions.''
   Union activists have reported about 350 miners were fired
following strikes in the coal region of southern poland and dozens
of other workers received army draft notices.
   Solidarity sources, speaking with the condition of anonymity,
said the statement should not be considered an ultimatum and the
round-table talks could begin even without official gestures.
   Tadeusz Mazowiecki, an adviser to Walesa, said Solidarity wanted
a signal from authorities that the talks could be held ``in serious
conditions with a chance for success.''
   Mazowiecki said Walesa and representatives of four regional
strike committees would represent Solidarity at the talks with the
government.
   Saturday's meeting was held at St. Brygida's church near the
Lenin shipyard where Solidarity was born in 1980 amid nationwide
strikes and became the first free trade union in the Soviet bloc.
   Attending the meeting were the 15-member national executive
commission of Solidarity, representatives of strike committees
during the Aug. 16-Sept. 3 wave of strikes and members of the
interfactory strike committees.
   Among the 40 participants were solidarity advisers such as Jacek
Kuron, Adam Michnik and Zbigniew Romaszewski who monitor human
rights abuses.
   Nearby in another church, leaders of the banned Independent
Students Association met and drafted a statement in support of
Solidarity.
   ``I'm surprised by the way these people are prepared,'' Walesa
said during a break in the session.
   ``There are a lot of fighting people who I expected to represent
their fighting manner. And I am surprised by their great feeling of
responsibility and great wisdom, especially among the young
people.''
   Solidarity is seeking to win back the legal status it lost
following Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's Dec. 13, 1981,
martial-law crackdown.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban and Politburo member Alfred
Miodowicz, leader of the officially sanctioned trade union OPZZ,
last week reiterated the official stand that Solidarity cannot be
legalized again as a trade federation. But Urban also said
officials were entering the talks with no preconditions.
   Opposition spokesmen said they insist on the legalization of the
union, and they want the issue settled before they will engage in
talks on the broad range of political and economic problems.
   The talks to discuss workers' grievances were proposed by
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak during the August strikes,
Poland's worst wave of labor unrest since 1981.
   When Kiszczak and Walesa met Aug. 31 they agreed that the talks
could include discussing the future of Solidarity. Walesa then
appealed to his supporters for a speedy end to the remaining
strikes so the talks could convene.
   Col. Stanislaw Kwiatkowski, the chief government pollster, said
the authorities have no one to blame but themselves for being
forced back into talks with Walesa and Solidarity.
   ``Briefly stated, it is the sluggishness of the party and the
government which are to blame for the rebirth of Solidarity, whose
cadres have begun to count again in the political game,''
Kwiatkowski said in the Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy.

   Two former guerrillas of an underground Jewish
group once led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said they helped
assassinate a Swedish U.N. envoy to Palestine 40 years ago,
according to a television program.
   It was the first time that members of the Stern Group
acknowledged they were involved in the killing of Count Folke
Bernadotte, Israel's state-run Educational Television said.
   The militant group, also known as Israel Freedom Fighters, was
initially headed by Avraham Stern. It was a splinter faction of the
right-wing National Military Organization.
   The faction, which carried out terrorist acts to undermine
British rule in mandatory Palestine, opposed Bernadotte's proposals
that the United Nations be given control over Jerusalem and key
areas be returned to Arab jurisdiction.
   In 1942, after British police fatally shot Stern, the group was
led by Shamir, Natan Yellin-Mor and Yisrael Scheib-Eldad, the
group's ideologist.
   In interviews for Educational Television aired Friday, two
former members of the group said that Yellin-Mor and Scheib-Eldad
approved the assassination.
   The organization officially disbanded about four months before
the killing, and Shamir had no connection with the assassination,
said his spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.
   Although members of the group may have been involved, Ahimeir
said, ``There was no organization at the time, and Shamir was not a
commander.''
   Asked about Shamir's response to the TV report, Ahimeir said the
prime minister ``is dealing with the issues of present and future
and not with the distant past.''
   The issue was not expected to have any effect on upcoming
elections. Israelis have believed for years that the Stern Group
was behind the killing.
   Journalist Dan Margalit interviewed Yehoshua Zetler and Meshulam
Makover, who he said were the mastermind and the driver in
Bernadotte's killing.
   Margalit quoted Zetler as saying he decided to kill Bernadotte,
president of the Swedish Red Cross during and after World War II,
after the envoy proposed the formation of a union of an Arab and a
Jewish state.
   Bernadotte was appointed in May 1948 to negotiate a cease-fire
and recommend a settlement in Israel's 1948 War of Independence.
   ``Zetler said he conferred with Eldad, and the two traveled to
Haifa to discuss it with Yellin-Mor. Yellin-Mor demanded that after
the killing, the (Israel Freedom Fighters) deny its role and blame
the slaying on a tiny group of zealots called The Homeland Front,''
Margalit said.
   Scheib-Eldad, now an elderly philosophy lecturer living in
Jerusalem, said in a telephone interview he could not comment
because Zetler and Makover ``were talking about the operational
side, and I was the ideologist. I have no way of knowing if their
account is correct.''
   The television program quoted Makover as saying the guerrillas
arrived in two cars to the spot selected by Zetler for the Sept.
17, 1948, killing in downtown Jerusalem.
   When the three-car U.N. convoy approached the narrow street, the
jeep blocked its way and three guerrillas jumped outside, with
Makover staying behind the wheel, it said.
   Makover was quoted as saying guerrilla Yehoshua Cohen fired the
shots that killed Bernadotte.
   The assassination was widely blamed on the Israel Freedom
Fighters, and the Israeli government launched a nationwide hunt for
its members. About 400 people, including Yellin-Mor were arrested,
but the killers were never found.
   Scheib-Eldad said most of those detained were released, but some
faced trial for membership in an illegal organization.
   The organization was disbanded in May 1948 and most of the
members joined the Israeli army, but it preserved a separate status
in Jerusalem until it was outlawed after Bernadotte's assassination
in September.
   Yellin-Mor and Matitiyahu Shmulevitch, also a group member, were
sentenced to short jail terms and pardoned when the first Knesset,
or Parliament, convened in 1949, Scheib-Eldad said.

   An oil well blazed away Saturday as
firefighters slowly drained thousands of gallons of oil from 11
storage tanks before attempting to extinguish the fire and cap the
well, authorities said.
   One man was burned and $5 million worth of drilling equipment
was destroyed when the well ignited Thursday at a Seneca Corp. oil
field in Los Padres National Forest. The blaze apparently began
when a spark from an electric fan ignited fumes, officials said.
   The tanks each hold 33,600 gallons, Ventura County authorities
said.
   ``They're draining the oil tanks now,'' Fire Department
dispatcher Vicki Crabtree said. ``Then they'll have to cover over
the valve in order to cap the well off. The whole process will take
several days.''
   Oil field worker John Henry, 24, was in critical but stable
condition at Sherman Oaks Burn Center with burns over 60 percent of
his body.
   The fire is at the southern end of the national forest, which
reaches into five southern California counties.

   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq met
Saturday for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two
weeks.
   But talks were halted after less than four hours, suggesting an
impasse over Iraq's refusal to move the negotiations to New York
and Iran's support of a recess and change of location.
   U.N. officials said the negotiations would resume on Sunday.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz led the Iraqi delegation to the
meeting at the U.N. office in Geneva. The Iranians, headed by
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, came less than five minutes
later.
   As at their previous full meetings in Geneva, the two
delegations sat down at separate tables about 30 feet apart in the
Council Chamber of the U.N. building. The mediator, Jan Eliasson,
was seated at his own table at the head of the triangular
arrangement.
   Saturday's session was the first direct session at ministerial
level since the second day of talks Aug. 26.
   Earlier, an Iraqi official was quoted as saying Baghdad refused
to suspend negotiations and move them to New York.
   Sadoon Hamadi, Iraq's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, was
quoted in a newspaper interview as spelling out his side's
position, which clashes with Tehran's willingness to consider a
break and shift of venue.
   ``There is no justification to move the negotiations to New
York, because Iraq, Iran and the U.N. Secretary-General agreed on
Geneva as the place for these negotiations,'' Hamadi said in an
interview published Saturday in the Abu Dhabi daily Al-Ittihad.
   He said the talks are passing through a difficult stage and
accused Iran of trying to scuttle them from the start.
   The U.N. had no immediate official word on whether the latest
conflict has been resolved.
   Among Iran's priorities at the talks are a withdrawal of troops
to internationally recognized boundaries, exchange of war prisoners
and a U.N. investigation to determine who started the war.
   A long-standing dispute concerns a 1975 treaty setting the
Iran-Iraq boundary down the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
Iraq has renounced the pact and claimed the entire waterway, but
Iran says it still considers the treaty valid.
   The waterway has been blocked by sunken ships and silt nearly
since the start of the war in September 1980.
   In Nicosia, Cyprus, the foreign ministers' conference of the
101-nation non-aligned movement called on Iraq and Iran to
cooperate in good faith with the secretary-general for full
implementation of the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire.
   Earlier, Iranian deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed Hussein
Lavasani charged Iraq was preventing progress in Geneva by raising
``extraneous issues'' in the talks.
   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Wissam al-Zahawi, told a plenary
session Iran was ``trying to create a crisis in the negotiations.''

   The chairman of the American Stock
Exchange hurled a symbolic pitch Saturday to mark the delivery of a
shipment of baseball equipment to Nicaraguans at a refugee camp in
Honduras.
   Arthur Levitt Jr., the exchange chairman, said another shipment
will be delivered to the refugees later and a third will be given
to Hondurans.
   Baseball has been a popular Nicaraguan sport since the U.S.
military intervention in the 1920s.
   Hundreds of refugees looked wide-eyed at the bats, balls and
gloves donated by U.S. major league baseball teams and sporting
goods manufacturers.
   ``This makes me happy,'' said Sabel Correa, 28, who fled
Nicaragua six years ago and at one time was a rebel fighting the
Sandinista government. ``Baseball is important to Nicaraguans.''
   Juan Enrique Gomez, who said he left Nicaragua two years ago to
escape being drafted into the army, agreed. He said the camp at
Jacaleapa has four adult basebll teams and two junior leagues.
   ``There's not much else to do,'' he said.
   The 517 helmets, 2,400 gloves, 1,600 bats, 800 caps, 700 balls
and 500 T-shirts delivered Saturday by a U.S. military transport
plane will be shared among 13,000 Nicaraguans in three U.N.-run
refugee camps in Honduras.
   Levitt, who is co-chairman of the International Commisson for
Central American Recovery and Development, said the idea for
providing baseball equipment emerged in 1987 when he visited the
Jacaleapa camp 60 miles east of the capital of Tegucigalpa.
   ``As you can see, there are vast numbers of children here with
nothing to do,'' he said, standing amid the rows of wooden shacks
that house more than 6,000 people.
   He said he approached Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth
about providing equipment and ``the response was great.''
   Levitt walked among crowds of children in tattered clothes, many
of them too young to remember their homeland. Their families fled
Nicaragua shortly after the left-wing Sandinistas ousted the
government of President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
   Many other refugees here crossed the border because of the
6-year-old war between the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras and
the Sandinistas.
   Oscar Grenado, 12, said his family left Nicaragua in 1981. He
said his father and a brother were both Contra and were killed
fighting the Sandinistas. A sister and another brother are still
with the Contras, he said.
   ``I really learn baseball,'' he said quietly, adjusting his
baseball hat.
   Scores of youths took part in a training session led by Rafael
Avila, a Cuban-born scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
   ``I tell them I never saw a city until I was 14 and three years
later I was playing major league ball,'' Avila said.

   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan, who
collapsed after speaking to a student audience, was released from
Georgetown University Hospital Saturday after spending two nights
there.
   Hospital officials said the cause of Rowan's collapse appeared
to be heat and exhaustion.
   The columnist collapsed Thursday night after delivering a speech
on the presidential election at American University.
   Rowan is scheduled to appear in court Monday to face charges
that he used
   an unregistered gun when he allegedly shot an intruder who had
taken an authorized swim in Rowan's pool on June 14.
   Rowan has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a trial is set
for Sept. 22.

   The army imposed a curfew Saturday in the West
Bank's largest city after a Palestinian was fatally stabbed and
Israeli troops wounded 14 Arabs in a series of clashes, the
military and hospital officials said.
   Residents in Nablus said the stabbing victim, 35-year-old Athad
Abu Ghosh, may have been killed by fellow Arabs for allegedly
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   His death early Saturday brought to 262 the number of
Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt
in the 1967 Middle East war. Five Israelis also have been slain.
   In Gaza City, one Palestinian was killed and three were wounded
Saturday when a bomb was thrown at their car, the army said. It
reported the attack involved a feud between families and was not
linked to the anti-Israeli uprising.
   Arab reports identified the slain man as Hassan Ayad, 20, and
said reasons for the attack were unclear.
   Hospital officials said Israeli troops firing regular bullets
wounded four Palestinians in clashes in and around Nablus and at
least 10 other Arabs were injured by rubber bullets and beatings.
   They said a 12-year-old boy was struck in the eye by a rubber
bullet and was in critical condition.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed to crush the uprising in a
New Year's message to soldiers Saturday. The Jewish New Year, or
Rosh Hashana, starts Sunday afternoon.
   ``We shall repel this wave of violence,'' Rabin said. ``We shall
act to calm down the (occupied) territories and allow peace talks
to take place.''
   An army official confirmed the stabbing death of Abu Ghosh and
indicated it was one of the reasons for the indefinite curfew on
Nablus, the West Bank's biggest city.
   ``But the army has several reasons for imposing the curfew,'' he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He declined to elaborate.
   Parts of the city, where 125,000 Palestinians live, were under
curfew while other areas were declared closed military zones, he
said. Curfews keep people off the streets, and declaration of a
military zone prevents movement in and out of a particular
neighborhood.
   The army said it also imposed a curfew on the nearby refugee
camp of Balata, home to some 12,000 Palestinians.
   An official at Nablus' Ittihad Hospital said the facility
treated four Palestinians age 16 to 20 who were shot and wounded
Saturday in clashes with Israeli troops in Nablus and the nearby
village of Tel.
   A 20-year-old wounded in the abdomen was in serious condition,
while the others were wounded in the stomach, face and leg,
respectively, he said.
   The Ittihad Hospital official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said town residents were afraid that in imposing the
curfew ``the army is going to do the same thing as they did in
Qalqilya.''
   Qalqilya, a West Bank town of 25,000, has been under curfew for
five days as soldiers conduct house-to-house searches and make
arrests. At least 200 suspected Palestinian activists have been
detained in the largest military operation since the start of the
Arab uprising.
   A similar raid was conducted Friday in the West Bank village of
Kfar Malik. The army surrounded the village at dawn and arrested 25
Palestinians suspected of anti-Israeli activities, Arab witnesses
said.
   On Saturday, villagers in Kfar Malik raised a dozen outlawed
Palestinian flags and painted new anti-Israeli slogans on the walls
to replace those whitewashed during the army raid, said an Arab
reporter who visited the village.
   In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops captured four guerrillas
after seriously wounding one of them in a brief firefight Saturday,
the Israeli military command said. There were no Israeli
casualites, the army said.
   It said an Israeli army patrol spotted the four guerrillas in
the central sector of Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in
southern Lebanon and attacked the squad.
   Israel Television said the guerrillas were apparently on their
way to carry out an attack in the security zone, a six-to-10 mile
wide buffer area along the border.

   Up to 60,000 gallons of crude oil from a
burst underground oil line gushed down a busy suburban street into
sewers and the Los Angeles River Saturday, officials said.
   The break in the Mobil Oil Co. pipe closed Ventura Boulevard in
the Encino area and exits from the Ventura Freeway. The line broke
about 4:30 a.m. and leaked down streets in a half-mile radius, said
police Sgt. Frank Guarino.
   Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said the company hired
contractors to vacuum oil off the streets into trucks, sand
oil-stained curbs and steam-clean and hose down Ventura Boulevard.
   The cause of the break was unknown, Carbonetti said. A similar
incident 2{ years ago in Granada Hills was caused by corrosion.
   An operator at Mobil's Torrance plant shut down the pipe four
minutes after a drop in pressure was noticed, he said. Automatic
controls would have shut down the pipe a few minutes later, he
added.
   The leak in the pipe, which spans 180 miles from Bellridge to
Torrance, will have no significant effect on the company's
operations, he said.
   Carbonetti said the company sent representatives through the
affected neighborhood to take damage claims from residents and
businesses.
   Six barriers were placed in the river to prevent crude oil from
reaching the ocean, he said.
   Officials did not know how much oil seeped into the river
through sewers, Fire Department spokesman Jim Williamson said.
   A police hazardous materials team notified county health
officials but determined the spill posed no danger and did not
require evacuations, Guarino said.
   Reserve and traffic officers spent the day diverting traffic.

<TEXT>
   Civil rights activists who worked
together in the 1960s were honored at a reunion Saturday for a
struggle that one said is ``not for one day, or one week, or one
year, but for a lifetime.''
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., former chairman of the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, received an honorary doctorate
at a convocation opening Williams College's 196th academic year,
along with Rosa L. Parks, whose refusal to surrender her seat to a
white passenger on a Montgomery, Ala., bus sparked the modern civil
rights movement.
   Parks received a standing ovation from the audience of 1,000
students, faculty members and administrators.
   Others were also honored, including the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy,
former president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
and Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the first black woman at the University
of Georgia and now a public television news correspondent.
   ``We have lost some of our finest leaders, but we are still very
involved in that same movement for liberation,'' said Lewis during
his address. ``Our struggle is not for one day, or one week, or one
year, but for a lifetime if that's what it takes.''
   Lewis was jailed 40 times and severely beaten during the 1960s
for leading peaceful marches and demonstrations throughout the
South.
   He said people often ask him if the civil rignts movement is
dead and he always says no.
   ``The nature and the character of the movement has changed, but
these changes are merely part of a natural process and do not spell
doom for our hopes,'' Lewis said.
   Lewis said the American people must elect leaders with the
``moral capacity'' of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. if civil
rights are to improve with time.
   ``There are going to be some setbacks,'' he said. ``But we are
going to move toward the beloved community; we are going to make it
as a people and as a nation.''

   Thousands of people jammed a broad avenue
Saturday for the first mass rally organized by leftist groups since
a bloody coup ousted them from power 15 years ago.
   ``This is clear proof that the Chilean left is alive,'' Hernan
del Canto, who had served as an Interior Minister under Marxist
President Salvador Allende, told rally participants.
   The rally was held on the eve of the anniversary of the Sept.
11, 1973, military coup that crushed the Allende's elected
government. Allende perished during the fighting at the
Presidential Palace.
   Organizers said about 80,000 people attended the festive and
peaceful rally along a broad avenue in a working-class district of
the capital. Reporters estimated the crowd at around 40,000.
   The rally was called by the United Left, a seven-party coalition
that includes the outlawed Communist Party.
   Red communist flags clearly ounumbered the banners of other
parties waved by people in the enthusiastic crowd.
   As a police helicopter hovered overhead the people booed and
chanted, ``Murderers! Murderers!'' Police did not intervene and
remained several blocks away.
   Among those at the rally were several people who, like del
Canto, had been ranking officials in the Allende administration.
They returned to Chile after President Augusto Pinochet issued a
decree 10 days ago abolishing the policy of political exile.
   Pinochet, 72, is the army commander and led the coup against
Allende. His military government has ruled since the coup and he is
seeking to remain in office for eight more years through a
presidential referendum set for next month.
   Speakers called for unity to defeat Pinochet in the referendum
scheduled for Oct. 5. Pinochet was picked by himself and the
commanders of the air force, navy and national police as the only
candidate in the referendum in which the voters will accept or
reject him.
   ``Without us, victory will not be possible in the referendum,''
said Anibal Palma, a socialist and president of the coalition.
``Without us, it will not be possible to put an end to the
dictatorship and recover democracy.''
   More than 100,000 people joined in an opposition rally in
Santiago on Monday, but that was dominated by centrist parties and
Saturday's gathering was the first to be held only by the leftists
since military rule began.
   Police battled demonstrators at Monday's rally and three people
were killed, 21 injured and more than 1,000 detained.
   On Saturday, speakers repeatedly called on the crowd to disband
peacefully, ``avoiding violence, disturbances and provocations.''

   ``The Last Emperor'' officially premiered in
Beijing Saturday with little fanfare and less than a full house,
drawing few luminaries and only scattered applause.
   Originally set for Sept. 27, the official premiere of the
acclaimed film about the life of China's last emperor, Henry Pu Yi,
was moved up at the last minute.
   Associate producer Franco Giovale, who is in Beijing working on
another movie, was the only representative from the West who
attended. He said he was informed of the Saturday afternoon
screening only three days in advance.
   Director Bernardo Bertolucci was in his hometown of Parma,
Italy, and unable to make the trip on short notice, Giovale said.
   Also missing was China's Vice Minister of Culture Ying Ruochen,
an actor who played the prison warden, and leading members of the
government and culturual circles.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the premiere was moved up
at the request of Chinese cinema managers anxious to show the
Italian-Chinese co-production that has won international acclaim.
   Selected theaters in Beijing and Shanghai have had special
screenings that have drawn large crowds of Chinese eager to see why
the film won nine Oscars and to compare it with a Chinese TV series
of the same name.
   However, the audience at the premier filled only three-quarters
of the cinema in Beijing's Nationalities Palace, and one woman said
she came only because a friend had given her the free ticket.
   Although the audience reacted with laughter at the antics of the
baby emperor and cheered during the scenes of zealous Red Guards
marching through the streets during the Cultural Revolution, there
was only brief and scattered applause when the credits rolled.
   Some have criticized the movie, which was shot in China, as
being inaccurate, and others say it represents a foreigner's view
of China.
   ``It's likely that some Chinese audiences will be unhappy with
that,'' said Chen Haosu, Vice Minister of Radio, Film and
Television, the highest government official who attended the
premiere.
   ``But why should we ask the foreign director to make films the
same as we are used to seeing?'' he asked in his remarks at the
movie's premiere.
   Chen said the film helped introduce China to millions.

   A group of idled airline passengers used the power
of the pocketbook to avert a long layover on a Portugese island,
paying to refuel a Boeing 737 after an airport refused the pilot's
credit card, British Airways said Saturday.
   The airline said the pilot of the London-bound flight raised
$2,000 from among the 100 passengers after the Porto Santo airport
refused to accept the standard credit card used by pilots for
refueling costs.
   One passenger even kicked in $1,000, said an airline spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The airline reimbursed the
passengers on the Sept. 3 flight when they arrived at London's
Gatwick Airport, he said.
   The snafu occurred during what should have been a routine
refueling stop on the island in the north Atlantic Ocean, the
spokesman said.
   The flight originated on the island of Funchal, which like Porto
Santo, is in the Madeira island group.
   British Airways initially had planned to use a Gibralta Airways
aircraft for the flight, but because of a scheduling change used a
chartered Caledonian Airways aircraft.
   When the flight landed at Porto Santo to refuel, the ground
staff refused to accept the credit card because the aircraft was
not the one the airport had been expecting, the spokesman said.
   He said the fuel collection was a ``bit unorthodox, but it was
done to save time. It is the first time I have heard of such a
situation occurring.''
   He said British Airways has filed a complaint with the airport.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell on Old Faithful
on Saturday, as thousands of firefighters faced high wind that
fanned already enormous forest fires, and Cabinet-level officials
inspected damage to the oldest national park.
   A nearby mining town was evacuated and nonessential people were
sent out of park headquarters.
   A storm with winds up to 30 mph and gusts of up to 40 mph
measured near Mammoth moved south and east through Wyoming Saturday
afternoon.
   But in most areas of Yellowstone, ``things didn't get quite as
intense as they thought probably they would,'' said Linda Miller, a
spokeswoman at park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs.
   About a quarter inch of rain fell in the Lake Yellowstone area,
while scattered showers hit most of the southern half of the park.
Fire information officials said puddles gathered in the roads and
the rain quieted fire activity by increasing humidity in the area.
   All roads and entrances were closed to visitors Saturday, and
reporters had to travel in convoys escorted by park personnel.
``We're making sure people don't get into situations they can't get
out of,'' said Yellowstone spokeswoman Marty Tobias.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng and Deputy Defense Secretary William Howard Taft IV arrived at
West Yellowstone, Mont., where they were briefed in private by fire
and weather officials before going to Old Faithful geyser and
flying over the park.
   ``I didn't think I'd ever see anything quite like Mount St.
Helens, but I did here,'' Lyng said.
   Fires have charred more than 906,000 acres of the
2.2-million-acre park. Adding destruction in the national forests
and parks surrounding the park in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming pushes
the figure to over 1.2 million burned acres.
   Fires also burned in Alaska, California, Colorado, Utah and
Washington.
   So far this year, Western fires have burned nearly 3.8 million
acres, an area larger than Connecticut, in what officials call the
worst fire season in 30 years. That includes some 2 million acres
in Alaska.
   The 229,400-acre North Fork fire had burned to within a mile of
Mammoth Hot Springs and was slowly bearing down on the area, fire
managers said. Nearly 400 firefighters were on hand to protect
buildings.
   The Mammoth Hot Springs Inn, the last of the lodging facilities
available in Yellowstone, was closed Friday. It had been scheduled
to stay open for the season until Sept. 19.
   The 650 residents of Gardiner, Mont., which is at the north
entrance to Yellowstone and five miles north of Mammoth Hot
Springs, stood ready to evacuate.
   Jardine, Mont., a mining community of 100 to 150 people four
miles from Gardiner, was evacuated Saturday because its only escape
route was through a canyon to Gardiner, said Betty Schmitt of
Gallatin National Forest in Montana.
   A review of National Park Service policy on fighting wildfires
will likely lead to changes after this year's devastating fires in
the West, Hodel said.
   ``In light of what has happened, we recognize you simply fight
every fire as hard as you can from the beginning,'' Hodel said to
cheers from townspeople in the audience at a news conference in
West Yellowstone, Mont.
   ``I think they'd have to'' change, Hodel said of the Park
Service's so-called ``let burn'' policy in which natural fires are
allowed to burn except where they threaten lives or property.
   In Washington state, the bodies of two men were recovered
Saturday from the burned wreckage of a helicopter that disappeared
Friday while fighting that state's largest forest fire, a
46,000-acre blaze, said Forest Service spokesman Greg Thayer. The
craft was found near a ridgetop north of Wenatchee, and recovery
teams had to ride helicopters to the top of the ridge and hike down.
   Chelan County Sheriff Joe Collins said the HU-204 ``Huey''
helicopter apparently snagged its empty water bucket on some trees
and crashed. Collins said the victims were believed to be Canadians.
   Last month, one person died in the crash of a helicopter
involved in battling a blaze in Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest.
   The first death directly attributable to fires this year
occurred last week in Glacier National Park in Montana, when a
firefighter was struck by a falling, burning tree.
   In northeastern Utah, residents who were driven from 50 homes in
the tiny community of Whiterocks were allowed to return home
Saturday. A fire in the Ashley National Forest had knocked down
power lines to the community, and the residents were without power.
   Four mobile homes were destroyed by the fire, which surged to
within a mile of the hamlet before being checked by firefighters
and the weather.

<TEXT>
   The Children's Museum sent its
2,500-year-old mummy to the hospital Saturday to learn more about
the ancient woman from Egypt.
   During her visit to Indiana University Hospital, Wenu-hotep got
her picture taken with a three-dimensional CT scan that provided a
never-before-seen view of her face.
   ``We found much finer pictures than I would have expected of the
bones. These were incredibly clear and detailed images of the
skull, the tissues, the internal bones of the skull,'' said Robert
Pickering, curator of anthropology for the museum.
   Pickering said the X-rays could be used later as the basis for
artistic renderings to show what Wenu-hotep's face looked like.
   The physical anthropologist said the scan also showed in detail
the hole used to remove Wenu-hotep's brain during the mummification
process, as well as resins and linen wrappings used to preserve the
body.
   ``We also cleared up an old problem,'' he said. ``In X-rays
taken about 1967 it appears there was a fracture of the left hip.
We were able to show pretty conclusively there was not a fracture
of the hip. In fact the hip appears to be normal.''
   Interest in Wenu-hotep has increased dramatically in the two
weeks since Frank J. Yurco, a Egyptological consultant from the
Field Museum in Chicago, performed new studies on her.
   Until then, scholars thought Wenu-hotep and her family were only
of minor importance. But Yurco discovered that she was a pivotal
mummy, meaning she provides totally new information about ancient
Egypt.
   Yurco's detailed readings of the art and hieroglyphics on the
coffin indicate Wenu-hotep's father, Hor-em-hat, was a high priest
of Thoth, the most important deity of the time.
   Yurco's study of the decoration on the coffin indicated that
Wenu-hotep lived between 525 and 400 B.C., 200 years earlier than
scholars previously thought; that she lived during a Persian rule
of Egypt; and that she was a woman of wealth and power in her own
right.

   Investigators worked Saturday to determine
what caused a cloud of steam or smoke to drift onto Interstate 26,
leading to a 17-vehicle pileup that killed four people and injured
16 others.
   ``I wouldn't even attempt to try to state a cause'' of the
wreck, said state Highway Patrol Trooper V.R. Burkett. ``It's still
under investigation.''
   Witnesses said the road was wet from a fine mist when the
accident occurred Friday after a cloud suddenly blocked visibility.
Some witnesses suggested the cloud was steam from a nearby National
Welders Supply Co. plant, but company officials denied that was
possible.
   Burkett said five tractor-trailers and 12 other vehicles were
involved in the wreck, which occurred about 4:30 p.m. about 15
miles south of here. The highway was closed for 9{ hours.
   Five people remained hospitalized Saturday in stable or good
condition. Eleven others were treated and released.
   The dead were Claire Bowie, 44, an interior designer from
Orangeburg; Robert Adams Felker, 5, of Whitmire; and two other
persons whose identities were being withheld until they were
positively confirmed, authorities said.
   Ruby Hammond, a witness, said, ``There was some steam coming
from this plant over there, up in the air, and all of a sudden it
just dropped.''
   But plant manager Gerald Carver said he did not believe the
welding supply company plant had anything to do with the accident.
He said some gases are regularly released from the plant, but they
normally dissipate within 10 feet of the 115-foot distillation
tower.
   ``A review of our operation indicates everything was normal at
the time of the accident,'' he said.
   Carmen Malphrus, who was treated at a hospital and released,
said she initially thought the cloud was harmless.
   ``I saw all these other cars going into the fog, so I just
assumed it's not that thick, I guess, everyone's going into it,''
she said. ``Then once I was in it I realized there was no
visibility.
   ``Then all of a sudden, bam, bam, bam, all of these cars started
hitting each other. And then you heard screaming. It was a huge
wreck,'' she said.
   ``Today was my birthday,'' she added. ``So maybe God just gave
me a birthday present and let me live.''

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Rejects Nicaraguan Proposal For New Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Nicaraguan rebels'
directorate on Saturday rejected the Sandinista government's offer
of a meeting in Guatemala to resume peace talks.
   President Daniel Ortega on Friday suggested a meeting Sept.
19-20 in Guatemala to discuss reopening high-level negotiations at
a later date in Managua to end the civil war.
   Roberto Ferrey, a member of the Nicaraguan Resistance said the
rebels, known as Contras, could not accept the proposal.
   In a telephone interview from his office in Miami, Ferrey said,
``A preparatory meeting isn't necessary and peace talks would have
to be somewhere other than Managua.''
   During a June round of talks in Managua, Contra leaders said the
government restricted their freedom of movement and any further
talks would have to be in another Central American country.
   There has been a cease-fire in the 7-year-old civil war between
the U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinista government since March
21. But high-level negotiations to deal with a permanent truce
broke down on June 9 in Managua.
   The Sandinistas have extended the cease-fire month-by-month and
the rebels have said they will abide by it. But each side has
accused the other of violations.
   Ferrey also said the Contras want opposition parties inside
Nicaragua included in future peace talks.

<HEAD>Yoko Ono Denounces Biography Of Lennon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yoko Ono, widow of slain Beatle composer and
guitarist John Lennon, has denounced a biography of her husband by
Albert Goldman as ``all lies,'' according to The Sunday Times of
London.
   The weekly reported it was told by Ono at her home in New York
that she contemplated suicide when she discovered what the American
writer intended to publish in his book, ``The Lives of John
Lennon.''
   ``I've been undergoing character assassination for the past 20
years,'' she was quoted as saying. ``When this whole thing started,
I kept thinking of ((Spanish painter Pablo) Picasso's wife and how
she finally killed herself. Then I realized I could never do
anything like that because I have my son Sean.''
   The newspaper reported she rejected Goldman's account that
Lennon was brain-damaged from childhood, psychopathic, vindictive,
cruel, homosexual and used to hit her. She said he never hit her
once and if he felt like hitting anything he would punch a big
pillow with both hands.
   The newspaper report said Ono was particularly hurt by Goldman's
assertion hat her love affair with Lennon was a cynical move to
promote record sales.
   It quoted her as saying Lennon was told as late as 1980 he could
sell more records if he pretended not to be attached to one woman,
but he refused.
   ``Neither of us was an angel. But we cherished and loved each
moment we were together, and were always frightened of losing each
other,'' Ono was quoted as saying.
   The Sunday Times said she believes a new film titled ``Imagine:
John Lennon,'' scheduled to be shown next month, ``is her best
defense against Goldman'' as it was compiled from footage of their
life together after the Beatles musical group broke up in 1970.
   Philip Norman, who wrote ``Shout. The True Story of the
Beatles,'' interviewed Ono and her son for The Sunday Times. He
called Goldman's book ``700 brutishly ill-written, ill-researched,
pretentious but soggily ignorant pages.''
   Lennon was shot to death Dec. 8, 1980, in the courtyard of his
New York City apartment building by Mark David Chapman, a former
Beatles' fan who was convicted of the killing and sentenced to
prison for a term of 20 years to life.

Activists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investigators say the home of an anti-drug
activist was torched and at least two other activists have reported
threats.
   ``I was hurting somebody's business, stepping on somebody's
toes,'' Lottie Chinn said after her home burned in a fire blamed by
authorities on arsonists.
   Ms. Chinn was appointed last month by Mayor W. Wilson Goode to
his new Leadership Anti-Drug Council. Goode ordered a full
investigation of Friday's fire that heavily damaged Ms. Chinn's
home.
   Ms. Chinn, 47, organized and led three anti-drug marches in her
neighborhood in June. She has stood with neighbors in front of drug
houses and demanded that the dealers leave.
   If the arson was in retaliation for her anti-drug work, Goode
said, then ``it is one more tragic example of the recklessness of
drug dealers in the city, and reaffirms the resolve of this
administration to push even harder to drive the pushers out of the
city.''
   Arsonists used a five-gallon plastic container to carry
flammable liquid to the second floor of Ms. Chinn's home,
investigators said. The fluid was poured in a rear bedroom and down
a back staircase.
   Earlier in the week, District Attorney Ronald Castille and two
city council members rallied with tenants of a public housing
complex, Abbottsford Homes, where some tenants reported threats.
   Dorothy and Betty, who spoke on condition their last names not
be used, said they received death threats after five people were
arrested on drug charges last month in the complex. In June, the
two had helped lead tenants through the complex, chanting slogans
such as ``Drug dealers got to go.''
   That slogan was mimicked by the death threat displayed by Betty:
``Newsy neighbors got to go before you land on death row!!'' The
message was accompanied by a stick figure drawing of a person with
a noose around the neck, and beside it the words ``This is you.''
   Gregory Kern, executive director of the Philadelphia Housing
Authority, said he was negotiating with police to open a
mini-police station at Abbottsford.
   Castille said he and Kern would try to enforce new federal
legislation that enables district attorneys to facilitate the
eviction of alleged drug-dealing tenants from public housing units.
While the housing authority already has the power to evict those
who sell drugs from their apartments, those evictions come slowly.

   Foreign ministers of the 101-nation
non-aligned movement closed a four-day meeting early Sunday after
adopting resolutions condemning Israel and South Africa.
   In their political report, the ministers said there was
``increased cooperation between Israel and South Africa,'' and
expressed ``indignation and dismay that certain Western nations ..
. continued to aid and abet apartheid economically, financially,
politically, diplomatically and militarily.''
   They noted ``with regret'' that, despite efforts to press
leading industrialized countries to impose mandatory economic
sanctions against white-ruled South Africa, the U.N. Security
Council had again been prevented from adopting sanctions by
American and British vetoes.
   The document expressed disappointment that Japan increased its
trade with South Africa, whose apartheid policies establish a
racially segregated society in which the 5 million whites control
the country and the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs.
   It called on member states ``to begin in earnest the stockpiling
of relief materials for appropriate use in support of the
front-line and other states in southern Africa, to assist them to
withstand reprisals by South Africa.''
   South Africa has been accused of launching raids in neighboring
black countries to strike at the African National Congress, the
main guerrilla group fighting the white-led government.
   The final document ``strongly condemned the hypocrisy of the
U.S. administration and the Pretoria racist regime for talking
peace'' in Namibia while continuing to provide military support to
the UNITA rebels fighting the Marxist government in Angola.
   With regard to the Palestinian attempts to establish a homeland
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the report said, ``The ministers
saluted the heroic uprising of the Palestinian people in the
(Israeli) occupied territories.''
   It said the uprising was ``tangible evidence of their
determination to have a state of their own, which proves the
futility of the Israeli efforts to continue the occupation of
Palestine.''
   The final report also said a Middle East settlement should be
based ``on the right of the Palestinian people to
self-determination and their right to establish an independent and
sovereign Palestinian state in their national homeland, Palestine.''
   The report called on both Iraq and Iran to cooperate in good
faith with the U.N. secretary-general for full implementation of
the UN-sponsored cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war, which went
into effect on Aug. 20.
   The non-aligned movement was formed in 1961 by nations claiming
not to be aligned with the East or West.
   Before adjourning, the foreign ministers decided early Sunday
that Yugoslavia will host next year's summit meeting and have the
chairmanship for the next three years.

<HEAD>Editors Aren't Splitting Hairs Over Split Infinitives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper and magazine editors are less
likely to split hairs these days over split infinitives, according
to an Indiana University English usage survey.
   ``It's time to boldly go where few editors have gone before,''
said the response of the Allentown Call, a Pennsylvania newspaper
participating in the survey. ``If the sentence would be awkward
otherwise, we should split the infinitive and not split hairs.''
   The move was in sharp contrast to the university's language
survey in 1981, when 88 percent of the editors said they would obey
one of the most ancient of grammatical rules: Never split an
infinitive.
   The copy chiefs were asked if they would shift the word
``instantly'' in the following sentence: ``The estimated 100
million Americans whose relatives arrived in the United States at
Ellis Island will be able to instantly trace their history at the
new computerized genealogical center planned for the restored
immigration site.''
   About half _ 52 percent _ said they would not change the
sentence, which appeared in The New York Times. However, The Times'
assistant managing editor, Allan M. Siegal, objected to his paper's
split of the infinitive ``to trace.''
   ``It was a violation of our own policy,'' Siegal said. ``We
split an infinitive when we cannot gracefully avoid doing so. In
this case, the graceful placement of the adverb would have been
after `history.' Split infinitives aren't wrong, but they annoy so
many readers that they should be avoided when possible.''
   But the Indianapolis Star disagreed with The Times. ``Splitting
infinitives is no longer a slavish matter. We treat them
individually, rather than a matter of course.''
   Many newspaper and magazine editors found failure to split an
infinitive awkward in certain contexts. Most infinitives are split
by an intensive modifier, as in ``to really try,'' ``to honestly
believe'' and ``to heartily support.''
   Other findings of the survey included a rejection of the word
``chairperson'' instead of ``chairwoman'' or ``chairman,'' and a
lack of affection for the use of ``like'' as a conjunction, as in,
``She ate like she hadn't had a square meal in at least a month.''
   The 10th English poll was conducted by Richard L. Tobin, a
professor in the Indiana University School of Journalism.

<HEAD>Iraq Protests U.S. Stand on Alleged Use of Chemical Weapons
Against Kurds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iraqi foreign minister said Saturday
that a U.S. Senate call for economic sanctions against his country
for allegedly using chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels was
ridiculous and unacceptable.
   Kurdish separatists praised the Senate action, which they said
came amid continued heavy fighting in Iraq's mountainous north.
   Minister of Information Latif Nassayif Jassim denied all reports
accusing Iraq of using chemical weapons against the rebellious
Kurds, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   INA quoted Jassem as saying, ``All the allegations aired by
certain political and media circles are ridiculous.''
   He called the Senate vote unacceptable and said America cannot
speak out about human rights while it is arming Israel's forces for
their attacks against Palestinians, according to the agency.
   Iraq's latest offensive against Kurdish separatists began soon
after a U.N.-mediated cease-fire was accepted Aug. 20 by Iran and
Iraq in their 8-year-old war. Many Kurdish separatists had backed
Iran in the conflict.
   The U.S. Senate voted Friday to condemn Iraq's alleged poison
gas attacks on its Kurdish minority and to impose stiff economic
sanctions aimed at throttling Iraq's ability to pay off its
estimated $60-billion debt.
   The measure, following the State Department's announcement that
it had proof of the attacks, still must be approved by the House of
Representatives and signed by President Reagan.
   A spokesman for the Kurdish rebels said the Senate action proved
the separatists' accusations about chemical weapons.
   ``The U.S has its own evidence through its own sources which
proves what we've been saying for a month,'' the spokesman said in
a telephone interview with The Associated Press in Cyprus. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman, speaking from a European capital where he
maintains radio contact with the insurgents, said the fighting is
continuing in the northern Kurdish regions.
   He said Iraqi forces were concentrated along the border with
Turkey, where he claimed 40,000 Kurds trying to escape were trapped.
   ``We are trying to rescue as many people as we can but we
haven't had much news from them in the last few days,'' he said,
adding that there was heavy fighting Sept. 6 and 7.
   He said 80 Iraqis were killed in the fighting in the northern
Amadiyeh district Sept. 7 and most rebel fighters had withdrawn. In
Sidikan on Sept. 6, Iraq launched a ``massive attack'' and lost 200
of its soldiers in the battle, according to the spokesman.
   He said 250 guerrillas had been killed since Aug. 26. Last week
the rebels said 2,000 civilians have been killed and 5,000 wounded,
many in chemical bomb attacks.
   Chemical weeapons are banned internationally under the 1925
Geneva accords.
   Diplomats in Baghdad said that since March Iraq has demolished
scores of Kurdish villages in the north, moving the inhabitants to
blocks of concrete apartment buildings in larger cities.

   A robbery suspect freed without bond walked out of
court and stole a new van for his ride home, police said.
   Mark Bartels told police he took the van ``because he had no way
to get home. He needed a ride,'' said Detective James Wright of
Metro-Dade police.
   Bartel, 19, of Pembroke Pines, was charged Thursday with auto
theft, his third arrest in a week, Wright said. Bartels was later
released without bond on the auto theft charge as well.
   Bartels was arrested Sept. 2 for burglary to a vehicle when a
car owner found him in his car trying to steal the radio, Wright
said. Detectives searching his pockets found credit cards stolen a
day earlier.
   On Tuesday, Bartels was arrested again for robbery after police
caught him with several womens' purses that had been stolen.
   He was released Wednesday, and stole the van a block away from
court, leading police cars and a helicopter on a 15-minute chase,
Wright said.

<HEAD>Talks Fail To Settle Cuban Withdrawal Date</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials from South Africa, Cuba and
Angola failed Friday to resolve the key issue of when Cuban troops
will withdraw from Angola, a South African official said.
   But the official said some progress was made during the two-day
meeting that ended Friday and that a cease-fire remained in force.
He said further talks will be scheduled.
   South Africa has made independence for South-West Africa
contingent on the withdrawl of Cuban troops from Angola, where
anti-Marxist rebels are fighting the Soviet-backed government.
   South Africa has administered the territory, also known as
Namibia, for 73 years in violation of U.N. resolutions.
   South Africa's military said two pro-independence rebels and two
members of the security forces were killed in a shootout in the
northern Namibia town of Oshikati.
   The Wednesday skirmish between guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization and the security forces was the latest
of several battles between the two sides since SWAPO said it would
begin observing a cease-fire Sept. 1.
   South African President P.W. Botha has said the Angolan peace
talks, one of a series of negotiations mediated by the United
States, would first deal with reports of recent Cuban troop
reinforcements in Angola.
   He said if the reports were true, they would constitute a
violation of the month-old cease-fire agreement.
   Cuba and Angola denied the claims, saying troop ships en route
to Angola carried replacements for the 50,000 soldiers already
there.
   The Cuban troops help Angola's Marxist government battle the
guerrillas and South African forces.
   The anti-Marxist force _ Jonas Savimbi's Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, or UNITA _ has been fighting the Marxist
government since Portugal granted Angola independence in 1975.
   The chief of the South African delegation, Neil Van Heerden,
said the talks allowed the two sides ``to make significant progress
on the problem.''
   ``We are going to study the proposals thatarose during the
course of the discussions'' and the parties will consult with their
governments before deciding on a date and venue for new talks, he
said.
   Van Heerden, director-general of the foreign affairs department,
declined to give details on the talks. But he said South Africa
would continue with its plan to begin implementation of a United
Nations' plan for independence for South-West Africa.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, at a news briefing in
Pretoria after his country's delegation returned, said all parties
at the talks had agreed to intensify their efforts to agree on a
timetable.
   He said they also discussed funding for the United Nations'
proposed independence plan for Namibia and South Africa's demand
that African National Congress guerrilla bases in Angola be removed.

<HEAD>Navy Fighter Crashed In Arabian Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy F-14 Tomcat jet fighter crashed in the
northern Arabian Sea earlier this week but both crewmen escaped
serious injury, the Navy said Friday.
   The two-seat fighter, assigned to Squadron VF-111 at the Miramar
Naval Air Station, Calif., was flying off the carrier USS Carl
Vinson on a ``routine training flight'' when it was forced to ditch
at sea Thursday night, the Navy said.
   The Navy added the cause of the crash was now under
investigation, but one Pentagon official who asked not to be named
said the plane had suffered ``a mechanical problem.''
   The Navy said the pilot ditched the Tomcat about 40 miles from
the carrier and that both the pilot and his weapon's officer were
subsequently rescued by a helicopter from the Vinson.
   One of the two suffered minor injuries while bailing out, the
Navy said, adding it did not have the identities of the crewmen
available.
   The Vinson recently began patroling in the northern Arabian Sea
to support other Navy warships assigned to escort duties in the
Persian Gulf. The United States is maintaining a large naval
presence in the Gulf while it waits to see if the cease-fire
between Iran and Iraq will hold.

   A world-record snapping turtle, recently captured
by a Maine man, will be exhibited this winter at the Bronx Zoo
before being returned to the wild, the Massachusetts Division of
Fisheries and Wildlife said Friday.
   John Rogers caught the turtle, which weighed in at 67 pounds and
has a shell length of 19.8 inches, in an undisclosed area in
northern Middlesex County. With its head and neck and foot-long
tail measured, it was well over three feet in length.
   The former world-record turtle, caught by a fisherman in
Minnesota in 1986, weighed 65\ pounds and had a shell length of
19.2 inches.
   Snapping turtles are among the most common reptiles in
Massachusetts, spending most of their time in the water.
   They feed primarily on vegetation, fish and carrion, and
occasionally catch waterfowl from the surface. Unless provoked, the
turtles pose no danger to people.

   A 32-year-old resident alien was in very

the United Nations, authorities said.
   The man, identified as Mehrdad Imen, was taken to New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where spokesman Jonathan Weil said
he had third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body.
   Imen doused himself with a flammable liquid and lit a match on
the corner of 42nd Street at First Avenue, said Detective Joseph
McConville, a police spokesman.
   Police did not know immediately where Imen lived or his country
of origin.
   They also said they did not know why Imen burned himself, but
his action coincided with a demonstration outside the United
Nations by exiled Iranians against the current government in Tehran.

   For the first time in six years, The New York
Times is raising the price of its weekday issues.
   The price is going up Sept. 19 to 35 cents on newsstands within
75 miles of the city and on all of Long Island.
   The increase was made necessary by cost increases, including a
21.5 percent rise in the cost of newsprint over the past two years,
according to Lance R. Primis, president of the newspaper.
   The Sunday edition still will cost $1.25 on newsstands within
the 75-mile area and the cost of home delivery from the Times
direct delivery service will remain the same.
   The nickel increase is the Times' first for the weekday editions
since March 1, 1982.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Fishing Vessel Safety Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday signed into law a
measure that for the first time requires commercial fishing vessels
to carry life rafts and other emergency equipment.
   The signing caps a three-year campaign for approval of safety
regulations for an industry whose safety record is the worst in the
United States.
   Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., who attended the private signing
ceremony and was one of the original sponsors of the measure, said
Reagan called it a ``good bill that will save lives.''
   The measure requires that commercial fishing vessels carry life
rafts, survival suits, emergency transmitters and medical supplies.
   Among the leading proponents of the legislation were Robert and
Peggy Barry, whose son Peter drowned when a 70-year-old fishing
vessel from Seattle sank off Alaska in the summer of 1985. The
vessel did not carry life rafts, radio equipment or survival suits,
and investigators concluded the ship should not have been at sea.
   ``The fact the bill was finally signed into law is a great
relief to all of us who have lost relatives or friends in the
fishing industry,'' said Robert Barry.
   He said more needs to be done, including manadatory inspections
on a regular basis, licensing of operators and training of crews.
   An average of about 80 fishermen die annually in accidents
involving commercial fishing vessels, according to Coast Guard
statistics.
   Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., said the rate of accidental deaths for
commercial fishermen is twice that of miners, whose occupation is
the second most hazardous.

<TEXT>
   Iraq on Friday accused Iran of wasting time in
negotiations for a settlement of their 8-year-old war, and the U.N.
mediator was reported ready to call a recess.
   A written Iraqi statement dismissed Iran's position as ``fantasy
to explain its flight from direct talks lately as a result of the
instability of the government it represents.''
   The Iraqi statement said negotiations cannot move past basic
cease-fire arrangements without action on two of the Baghdad
government's demands: free navigation in the Persian Gulf and
U.N.-supervised clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms
the southern frontier.
   The waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the gulf, has been blocked
by sunken ships and silt since the early weeks of the war, which
began in September 1980.
   On Thursday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati repeated the
Iranian position that those issues were ``extraneous elements'' and
could be addressed later.
   Velayati said negotiations have been hung up the agenda
disagreement since they began Aug. 25, five days after a cease-fire
took effect. He said Iran's priority is withdrawal of military
forces to internationally recognized boundaries.
   Iraq said Iran was giving a false picture and that Baghdad had
stated its position in two letters to U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar before the talks began, ``so the raising of these
two issues is neither extraneous nor new.''
   The statement said Iran was procrastinating and Velayati should
``get down to business.''
   Direct talks occurred only on the first two days in Geneva and
neither Velayati nor the Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, has
met with U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson since last Saturday. Perez de
Cuellar was mediator when the talks began, but put Eliasson in
charge Sept. 1.
   Signs increased Friday that the talks will recess and resume
later this month in New York.
   U.N. spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said continuing low-level,
indirect contacts were focusing on ``how to proceed'' and Eliasson,
a Swedish diplomat, probably would hold a news conference Saturday
or Sunday.
   Sources close to the talks said privately he was expected to
announce a recess but there still was disagreement over a date for
resumption.

<TEXT>
   A woman who admitted allowing her
3-month-old child to die of starvation was ordered Friday by a
judge not to become pregnant during her five-year probation.
   Stella Belona, 23, pleaded guilty in June to manslaughter with
the understanding that she would not be sentenced to more than 10
years in prison. According to probation terms set down by State
District Judge Mike McDonald, Belona must not become pregannt while
under court supervision.
   According to a police report, Arell Belona died Nov. 30, 1987,
from malnutrition so severe that he ``appeared mummified.'' The
infant had not been fed in three days, investigators said.
   ``This is a welfare mother who had no resources,'' defense
attorney Kathleen Richey said. ``What welfare meant to her was if
she could get a ride, then she could get food stamps.''
   Belona told police she had wanted to take the child to a doctor,
but had no transportation. Authorities said the child's weight had
dropped from about 7 pounds at birth to less than 6 pounds at death.
   McDonald said Belona was pregnant when she dropped out of school
in the seventh grade at age 16.
   In addition to a requirement that she not become pregnant,
Belona was ordered to live at a rehabilitation residence, learn to
read, obtain a high school equivalency certificate and undergo job
training.
   Belona's three other children _ ages 3, 2 and 1 _ appeared not
to suffer abuse, authorities said. They have been turned over to
child protection officers.
   A judge in Arizona last week reversed her order that a teen-age
mother, who left her two sons alone in a sweltering apartment for
three days, practice birth control throughout her child-bearing
years. The judge said her order was unenforceable since no method
of birth control is fool-proof.

   The chief air traffic controller in Miami has been
pulled off his job because he allegedly hitched too many free rides
on commercial airliners, a federal official said.
   William Abernathy is being investigated for possible abuse of
the ``flight familiarization'' program, which allows controllers to
ride in cockpits to observe flight procedures.
   Abernathy, who oversees 300 controllers, has been temporarily
replaced during the investigation, Roger Myers, spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration, said Thursday.
   Under the flight familiarization program, controllers are
limited to eight free rides a year, and only one can be
international.
   Abernathy, who has worked for the FAA for 24 years and has
headed the Miami office since January 1985, could have his flight
privileges suspended for two years if the abuse is proved, Myers
said.

   Bleachers in a high school gymnasium
collapsed Friday during a junior assembly, injuring at least 78
people and creating ``major chaos,'' authorities reported. None of
the injuries was described as serious.
   The entire junior class, about 300 students, was attending the
assembly at Maurice J. McDonough High School when the steel
bleachers gave way shortly after 8 a.m., said Linda Dent-Brown,
administrative assistant for the Charles County Board of Education.
   Ms. Dent-Brown said she didn't know how many students were on
the bleacher that collapsed. The 16-foot bleachers had a seating
capacity of 175.
   Charles County Fire Chief Ken Chaplin said it appeared a section
of the bleachers came apart.
   ``When we got here, it was basically major chaos,'' Chaplin
said. ``We had students, teachers in the bleachers trying to
comfort one another. A lot of victims, a lot of pain and agony
going on. A few of the students were actually still in the
bleachers themselves.''
   The incident was under investigation, officials said.
   ``It sounded like fireworks or a shotgun. It sounded like a
whole bunch of shots were going on. It was scary,'' one student
told WUSA-TV in Washington. ``It was like you saw them (the
bleachers) and then you didn't see them. ... They went one at a
time, but real fast. It was like dominoes.''
   Thirteen people were admitted to hospitals, including four who
were flown by helicopter to Prince George's Hospital Center in
Cheverly. They were in satisfactory condition Friday afternoon,
hospital spokeswoman Rosie Cobb said.
   At least 65 persons were treated and released. None of those
admitted was in serious or critical condition, hospital spokeswomen
said.
   In addition, a team of doctors and nurses from Physicians
Memorial Hospital in La Plata went to the school to treat an
unknown number of students with very minor injuries, said
spokeswoman Mary S. Haag.
   Classes at McDonough High, which has an enrollment of about
1,300, began Sept. 1. Pomfret is about 80 miles south of Baltimore.

<HEAD>U.S. Carrier Wins Ruling Against Japanese Restrictions</HEAD>

   The government said Friday it will restrict
U.S. air freight rights of Japanese airlines unless Japan allows
Flying Tiger Line, an all-cargo American carrier, to operate
unrestricted Europe-Alaska-Japan service.
   Accusing Japan of discriminating against Flying Tiger in
violation of the two countries' air transport agreements, the U.S.
Transportation Department declared that it will ``impose such
sanctions as are necessary'' against Japanese carriers.
   The department approved a complaint by Los Angeles-based Flying
Tiger charging that the Japanese government had unfairly sought to
restrict traffic on its proposed Europe-to-Tokyo freight service
via Anchorage, Alaska. It asked the department to restrict U.S.
cargo operations by Japanese lines ``sufficient to compensate for
the restrictions'' on Flying Tiger.
   ``The Japanese limitations on Flying Tiger's proposed operations
simply cannot be reconciled with Flying Tiger's rights'' under
government agreements, and ``moreover, those Japanese-imposed
limitations subjected Flying Tiger to patently discriminatory
treatment,'' the department said in its decision.
   The department said it would hold up retaliation against
Japanese companies pending the outcome of negotiations between the
two governments Sept. 19-22 in Tokyo. This was requested by Japan
Air Lines, one of two Japanese carriers ordered by the
Transportation Department to provide data about its freight
services in preparation for further U.S. action. The other was
Nippon Cargo Airlines.
   The department said it will be ``prepared to act expeditiously
to impose effective countermeasures in the event that diplomatic
initiatives do not resolve the dispute.''
   The department said Japan failed to approve Flying Tiger's
Tokyo-Alaska schedules unless it would accept ``unreasonable and
unjustifiable '' reporting requirements and route restrictions.

<DATELINE>GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire roared through a museum housing
one of the nation's largest collections of wax figures Friday,
destroying many detailed recreations of moments from Texas history.
   Almost 300 meticulously sculpted wax figures at the Southwestern
Historical Wax Museum _ ranging from Elvis Presley to John and
Jacqueline Kennedy to Robert Redford and Paul Newman _ were lost in
the blaze.
   ``One of the things that has made this fire so difficult to
fight was the fact these figures are just like a candle,'' said Lt.
Doug Conner. ``They generate tremendous heat. It appears it's
totally destroyed.''
   ``This was a major attraction in the community,'' said Mayor
Jerry Debo. ``It continued to be a major draw when other
attractions failed.''
   More than 100 firefighters brought the blaze under control
nearly three hours after the fire was first reported at the
25-year-old museum, officials said.
   One firefighter suffered minor injuries when a high-pressure
fire hose broke, Conner said. He was treated and released from DFW
Medical Center.
   Sonny Marston, operations manager for the Plaza Theater of Wax
in San Antonio, which is owned by the Grand Prairie museum, said
the company still has about 250 wax figures at its location across
from the Alamo, Marston said.
   ``We don't know much about the loss yet,'' Marston said of the
fire. ``But it's a temporary setback.''
   Popular attractions included the swearing-in of Lyndon Johnson
following Kennedy's assassination, figures of movie actresses born
in Texas, and bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde, who grew up just a few
miles away.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity opened a
campaign Friday to sell the Japanese American goods ranging from
speedboats to cat food.
   The drive has the approval of the Japanese government and the
powerful Keidanren, or Federation of Economic Organizations. The
Keidanren presented a lunch that included California orange juice,
Montana beef and Budweiser beer to show the growing acceptance of
American imports.
   Verity brought executives of 25 U.S. companies to Tokyo to study
the Japanese market and meet government officials.
   ``Now is the time to come and do business in Japan,'' Hajime
Tamura, minister of international trade and industry, said in
welcoming the group.
   In a speech to some 70 Japanese executives at Keidanren
headquarters, Verity said many trade disputes between Japan and the
United States have been resolved in the past year. Washington wants
to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States by
selling more in Japan rather than by restricting Japanese imports
to America, he said.
   ``Our firms are now very price competitive'' because of the
dollar's fall since 1985, and Japan is removing trade barriers,
Verity told the businessmen.
   He said the next thing required is ``an intensive effort by U.S.
firms to learn about and then develop imaginative and sound ways to
penetrate the Japanese distribution system in order to reach the
consumer.''
   Verity and Tamura call the campaign ``Market Japan _ with
America's best.'' They agreed in Washington in June to focus their
first effort on five areas of consumer products: Leisure goods,
sporting goods, jewelry, furniture and processed foods including
juices and pet food.
   Companies on the trade mission include Ralston-Purina of St.
Louis; Harry Winston of New York; Ladd Furniture of High Point,
N.C.; Cigarette Racing Team of Miami, and Woodstream Corp. of
Lititz, Pa.

<HEAD>Utility's Nuclear Plant Gets Evacuation OK</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HICKSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Shoreham nuclear plant, which
earlier this year seemed destined for mothballs, received a high
rating for the work of Long Island Lighting Co. workers in an
emergency evacuation drill, a federal report showed.
   The positive report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
came despite the refusal of state and Long Island officials to
cooperate because they claimed evacuation of the island was
impossible in the event of a real accident.
   ``The Shoreham monster is rising from its grave,'' said Richard
Kessel, the executive director of the state consumer protection
board and a long-time Shoreham opponent, after the FEMA rating was
issued.
   The two-day drill, which began June 7, tested how LILCO
responded to a simulated plant accident that required mock
evacuation of residents living within 10 miles of the plant.
   State and local officials said in June that LILCO showed it was
incapable of protecting the public because a majority of emergency
sirens in the evacuation zone failed or were not heard during the
drill.
   But FEMA officials said at the time that sounding the sirens was
not a required part of the exercise.
   Under current federal regulation, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission may not license a nuclear plant until there is an
emergency plan that gives reasonable assurance the public will be
safe if an accident occurs.
   LILCO spokesman James Lois said FEMA told the NRC in its report
Friday that the utility proved in the drill that its plan did
provide reasonable assurance.
   According to Lois, FEMA's evaluation of the June exercise and
the emergency plan itself support a finding of reasonable assurance
that the health and the safety of the public will be carried out.
   If the plan is acceptable to the NRC licensing board, it removes
emergency planning as an obstacle to issuance of a full power
operating license for a plant, Lois said.
   Kessel, saying he was extremely disappointed in the FEMA
decision, charged the federal agency ``turned logic upside down''
in its ruling.
   Earlier this year, Gov. Mario Cuomo _ another Shoreham opponent
_ helped work out a deal to purchase the nuclear plant from LILCO
and shut it down for good. But the plan has yet to be approved by
the Legislature, meaning that it still is possible for Shoreham to
one day go into operation.

   Iran says Iraq has captured 703 Iranian
officers and soldiers since both countries began observing a
cease-fire on Aug. 20, according to documents released Friday.
   ``The capture of these people by Iraq is in contravention of the
agreement on the cease-fire, and they should therefore not be
considered as prisoners of war,'' Mahmoud Sadat Madarshahi, charge
d'affaires at Iran's U.N. Mission, said in a letter to
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``It is hoped that the United Nations will take all the
appropriate and necessary measures to ensure the safe and speedy
return of these people.''
   The letter accompanied a list of the names of the missing men,
ranging in rank from private to colonel.
   Each side has accused the other of numerous violations of the
truce in their 8-year-old war. The belligerents have engaged in
peace talks in Geneva since Aug. 25.
   U.N. officials have said they will not comment on specific
claims of violations by the combatants.

   Underworld violence in the Boston area
may rise sharply in coming months and some defense attorneys may be
conspiring with mobsters to murder government informants, a
prosecutor says.
   Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan, chief attorney of the U.S. Justice
Department's New England Organized Crime Strike Force, suggested in
a speech to Massachusetts prosecutors Thursday that one reputed
Mafia leader is marked for death by his associates.
   Discussing the difficulties faced by federal authorities trying
to build cases against Mafia leaders who took over after the 1986
convictions of underboss Gennaro J. Angiulo and his associates,
O'Sullivan said:
   ``Any time we execute a warrant, the paperwork goes to a corps
of lawyers who attempt to identify informants so they can be
murdered.''
   O'Sullivan made the comments to a conference of the
Massachusetts District Attorneys Association.
   He said federal investigators know of ``an active attempt by
some unscrupulous members of the defense bar'' to assist the mob.
He did not name individual attorneys.
   O'Sullivan described Vincent M. Ferrara, whom the FBI publicly
identified in April as one of seven Mafia leaders in Boston, as a
``psychopathic killer'' who had angered his associates so that some
want to kill him.
   Ferrara's lawyer, Anthony M. Cardinale, said O'Sullivan had
engaged in ``prosecutorial conduct of the worst kind.''
   ``He is attempting not only to poison the minds of the grand
jury, he is making a mockery of the entire grand jury system,''
Cardinale told the Boston Globe.

   Hundreds of evacuees returned to their homes
under sunny skies Friday to find water-logged carpets and damaged
furniture from a flood that claimed at least six lives.
   Central Florida dried out from four days of torrential rains
that sent rivers surging over their banks.
   ``Today, we have sunshine and dry feet,'' said Red Cross worker
Jean Ann Crutchfield as shelters closed in Pinellas County. The
shelters had housed 160 people overnight.
   Weather forecasters said the near-stationary front responsible
for the battering storm continued to drift north. The storm system
was not connected with Hurricane Florence, which was roaring up the
southeast Louisiana coast Friday.
   Forecasters said Friday it didn't appear as if the storm system
would join forces with Hurricane Florence.
   Gov. Bob Martinez took an aerial tour of hardest-hit Manatee
County and said afterward he would sign an executive order Saturday
declaring a state of emergency to pave the way for state crews to
help assess damage and clear debris.
   County public works officials estimated between $12 and $24
million in damages to 37 bridges.
   Although flooding was subsiding, Martinez said he could see from
the air effects of the monsoon-like downpours that dumped 15 inches
of rain in two days, pushed the Manatee River 9 feet above flood
stage and swelled the county's reservoir to the highest level since
1974.
   Martinez predicted the county would qualify for federal disaster
assistance. He said state assessment teams would collect damage
data from homeowners to determine if the county met federal
disaster relief criteria.
   The flooding prompted local officials to declare a state of
emergency Wednesday and order the evacuation of 1,000 people. Many
returned home Thursday.
   Throughout the Tampa Bay area, waterfront residents spent Friday
ripping out soaked carpets, patching leaky roofs and stacking
ruined furniture in garages or on front lawns.
   While flood waters were subsiding in Manatee, Hillsborough,
Pinellas and Pasco counties, trouble spots remained.
   In Tampa, traffic was diverted around a closed stretch of
flooded Interstate 4, a key artery and hurricane evacuation route.
   The Alafia River southeast of Tampa crested Friday at 7 feet
above flood stage, covering cars and riverfront homes up to the
roofline. West across Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg, overflowing
creeks swamped streets and homes in scattered communities leaving
people in low-lying areas wading through knee-deep water.
   A tornado hit St. Petersburg on Thursday night, causing damage
to six houses, but no injuries were reported.
   The rising waters from the Tampa-area storm left two dead on the
west coast. James Edward Mercer, 44, of Tampa was drowned Wednesday
after his car plunged into a ditch and he was sucked into an
underground pipe near downtown Tampa. His body was found Friday a
quarter mile away. In New Port Richey, 2-year-old Matthew Rehm
drowned in a rain-swollen canal.
   The storm front also contributed to the crash of a small plane
Wednesday that killed all four on board near Williston, about 110
miles north of Tampa.

   Smoke drifting into the Nebraska Panhandle
from forest fires in Wyoming and Montana caused state environmental
officers to place the western half of Nebraska under an air
pollution warning Friday.
   The alert was prompted by high pollutant concentrations downwind
from the fires. It will remain in effect until the smoke clears,
said Dennis Grams, director of the Nebraska Department of
Environmental Control.
   People with respiratory ailments, young children and elderly
persons should curtail exposure and outdoor activities until
conditions visibily improve, he said.
   Exceptionally high levels of smoke particles were measured
Friday in Sheridan, Wyo. Higher concentrations were expected to
develop to the south, he said.
   Visibility was reduced to 4 miles at the Alliance Airport on
Thursday, the National Weather Service said. A thin veil of smoke
remained across most of the state Friday with visibility again in
the 5-mile range at some weather stations.

   In a 1985 autobiography, Dhellemmes described his 40 years of
work in Cameroon and Congo, where he sought to improve the health
and social welfare of pygmy tribes.
   As a young missionary, Dhellemes worked from 1948 to 1952 in a
leper colony in eastern Cameroon. He began working among pygmy
tribes in 1953.

<TEXT>
   The Denver Symphony Orchestra, which had
threatened to file for bankruptcy, on Friday announced cutbacks and
new fund-raising designed to save the 1988-1989 season.
   It also announced the appointment of a blue-ribbon panel to
ensure its future financial viability.
   At a news conference in the lobby of Boettcher Concert Hall,
DSO's home, Symphony Board Chairman Bob Lee said that the season
could go on only if several hundred thousand dollars was raised by
Oct. 1, and the budget was cut by reducing administrative costs and
freezing orchestra members pension contributions, eliminating
clothing and instrument allowances and not filling three vacant
positions.
   ``(Bankruptcy) It's not totally out of the picture,'' said Lee.
``I hope we don't have to revisit that.''
   The orchestra already canceled its scheduled season-opener
Thursday, but could be ready for its second scheduled concert if
the money is collected, officials said.
   Mayor Federico Pena also announced that he would appoint an 8-10
person panel to study long-term solutions of symphony funding and
make recommendations that would stabilize the situation that has in
recent years become an annual problem.
   Two years ago, the musicians in the orchestra took 20 percent
cuts in wages to keep the group solvent, and spokesman Brian
Ventura said the fact they were willing to accept further delays in
resumption of full benefits indicated their commitment. This year's
problem was a difference of about $650,000 in projected expenses
and projected revenue.

<TEXT>
   The Chicago Sun-Times is asking its editorial
staff to take a 15 percent salary cut and accept reductions in
other benefits and the elimination of overtime pay, staff members
say.
   A union memo posted at the newspaper Friday presented the
management offer, which proposes a three-year contract with staff
members taking a 15 percent pay cut the first year, confirmed a
staffer who asked not to be identified.
   Editorial staffers would get a 5 percent raise the second year
of the contract and a 10 percent raise in the third, he said.
   Sun-Times Executive Editor Kenneth D. Towers refused to comment
on the memo.
   Officials at the Chicago Newspaper Guild, which represents about
280 reporters, photographers, copy editors, assistant city editors,
library staff and other workers, could not immediately be reached
for comment.
   The offer called for the elimination of overtime pay and would
throw out a 10 percent bonus for working at night.
   Instead of overtime pay, the Sun-Times proposed giving
additional time off to those who work overtime.
   The proposal would also increase the amount of time employees
work from 7{ hours a day to 8 hours a day, eliminate severence pay
and allow workers to be terminated if their jobs become obsolete
because of advances in technology.
   The newspaper and the union have been negotiating for a new
contract. The old pact expired May 31, but employees have been
working under its terms.
   The memo comes one month after Sun-Times president and publisher
Robert Page resigned, two years after spearheading a $145 million
buyout of the newspaper from Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch.
   Page resigned amid speculation of a rift between him and
Sun-Times Chairman Leonard P. Shaykin about the newspaper's
financial performance.
   The Sun-Times was founded in 1948 by the Field family of
Chicago, which owned the newspaper until 1984 when it was sold to
Murdoch for $90 million.

<TEXT>
   A group of blacks from a church in Florida
claimed Israeli troops harassed them Friday and denied them entry
to visit holy places in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.
   The Rev. S. D. James said the Israeli officials at the Allenby
Bridge accused people in his 31-member group from James' church in
Opa-locka, Fla., of having false passports.
   The Allenby Bridge is a major crossing point over the Jordan
River between Jordan, where James' group is staying, and the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   ``They claimed that some members of the group had forged
passports,'' James said. ``Soldiers accused all of us of being
members of a Black Israelite group and they said that we needed a
special visa to get in.''
   Israel has had a long dispute with the predominantly American
Black Israelite organization that claims its members are Jewish and
have the right to settle in the Jewish state.
   James said Israeli soldiers pushed members of his group, forced
them back into their bus and would not let them through the bridge
checkpoint.
   He said a similar incident occurred last year when Israeli
authorities denied members of his church access to the West Bank.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East War.
   James said he had registered a complaint with the U.S. Embassy
in Amman, the capital of Jordan, and his group would try again
Wednesday to enter the West Bank.
   He said all the members in the group were from his church in
Opa-locka, a community 12 miles north of Miami.

   A man convicted of stabbing his daughter to
death has asked a judge to formally sentence him as soon as
possible so he can be put in a cellblock where televisions are
allowed.
   ``Please bring me in and sentence me,'' Gary Starr said in a
letter filed with Allegheny County Judge Jeffrey Manning's office
Friday. ``I thought the jury already sentenced me to death.''
   A jury on Aug. 23 sentenced Starr to die for the Feb. 19 murder
of Wanda Starr, 20, of Moon Township. The stabbing occurred after
Starr, a former apartment complex manager, confronted his daughter
about stolen rent money.
   During his trial, Starr admitted having had a 6-year incestuous
relationship with the woman.
   Starr requested the quick action because it will put him in a
section of the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh where
televisions are permitted, according to Thomas Seiverling, a prison
spokesman.
   Starr now is housed in the prison's diagnostic and
classification center, where televisions are prohibited, Seiverling
said.
   Sixteen years ago, Starr was convicted of shooting his wife,
Linda, to death as she slept in their Beaver County home. He served
8{ years in prison for that crime.

   Former New York Rep Hamilton Fish Sr.,
99, the oldest living former member of Congress, married his
live-in housekeeper Friday during ceremonies at a friend's house
here.
   Fish, who represented the mid-Hudson region from 1920 to 1945
and whose son, Hamilton Fish Jr., currently holds that 21st
Congressional District seat, wed Lydia Ambrogia, a former editor of
a weekly newspaper in the New Windsor area.
   It was the fourth marriage for the elder Fish. His third
marriage, to Alice Curtis Desmond, ended in divorce.
   The ceremony was held at the Englewood home of Fish's longtime
friend, Temple Hoyen Buell, who celebrated his 93rd birthday Friday.
   The bride, 56, is a grandmother of 10 and has children ranging
in age from 29 to 34. It is her third marriage.
   ``I'm getting married because I'm fortunate enough to meet a
very beautiful woman,'' Fish said. ``And I'm just lucky she'd marry
me at my age.
   ``I would go as far as saying that I feel _ and I'm not a deeply
religious fellow _ she's an angel from God,'' Fish said. ``She's
done more for me in the last three years to keep me alive and I
hope she can keep me alive for three or four more so I can spread
my message about the disarmament of nuclear arms.''
   Said the bride: ``He wants to talk about nuclear arms _ I say he
ought to talk about my arms.''
   Fish and his son both are Republicans; his grandson, Hamilton
Fish III, former publisher of The Nation magazine, currently is
running for Congress from the 20th Congressional District as a
Democrat.

layoffs of city workers and a shift in public opinion.
   Two of the four councilmen long opposed to the plan relented

police.
   The 5-to-2 vote came at about 1:30 a.m. after a day of meetings

deeply the Roman Catholic Church will be involved in the battle
against apartheid.
   The 10-day trip, the pontiff's fourth to Africa and his 39th
abroad, will include Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and
Mozambique _ all countries that vehemently oppose South Africa but
depend on it for economic survival.
   In an unusual statement Friday, the Vatican emphasized the pope
was not snubbing South Africa and hoped to visit the country in the
future. It said the pope's full schedule on this trip made a stop
there impossible.
   The statement appeared directed at reports the pope had ruled
out a visit to South Africa, where a white minority rules 26
million blacks.
   During nearly 10 years at the helm of the Roman Catholic Church,
John Paul has strongly denounced apartheid.

   Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel laureate and leading
Soviet dissenter, says he sees signs that the Communist Party
hierarchy and Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself are retreating from some
areas of Gorbachev's reform program.
   Asked Friday if Yegor K. Ligachev, a member of the ruling
Politburo, was behind the opposition to perestroika, or
restructuring, Sakharov said Ligachev's speeches show he is ``a
reactionary, dangerous force, but by far not the only one.''
   Regarding Gorbachev, Sakharov said he believed the Kremlin
chief's speeches have ``become more radical and show a deeper
understanding of the situation,'' but he saw elements of
backtracking.

   A federal jury awarded nearly $9 million
to a woman who claimed the Copper-7 intrauterine device made her
sterile, including the first punitive damages in one of the
hundreds of lawsuits over the IUD.
   After 10 days of deliberations, the jury ruled Friday that G.D.
Searle & Co. was negligent in testing and marketing the
birth-control device, and that its negligence led to Esther
Kociemba's sterility a decade ago.
   Searle attorney Paul Strain said he believed the verdict would
be overturned. He said there were a number of problems with the
jury deliberations, including card-playing in the jury room.

   The government today decided to end 26
years of single-party rule and announced that general elections
will be held under a multiparty system.
   A brief announcement on state-run radio said the decision was
made at an extraordinary congress of the Burma Socialist Program
Party. The broadcast did not say when the elections would be held.
   The congress was originally scheduled Monday to decide whether a
referendum on one-party rule would be called. Radio Rangoon said
more than 75 percent of the delegates today decided to scrap the
referendum idea and to ahead with elections under a multiparty
system.
   The decision was a victory for opposition leaders and for
hundreds of thousands of Burmese who have taken to the streets in
demonstrations that have toppled two presidents in three months.

   Police fired rubber bullets and
water cannons to break up an anti-government rally of 20,000 during
a nationwide general strike. Labor leaders called for another work
stoppage Monday.
   The clashes with police, vandalism, burning of cars and looting
of stores resulted in dozens of injuries and arrests during the
walkout Friday protesting spiraling inflation and unemployment.
   The unrest made the General Labor Conferation's 12th general
strike against the nearly 5-year-old government of President Raul
Alfonsin the most disorderly and bloody. Labor leaders and police
blamed each other for the violence.

   The Reagan administration is promising an
all-out effort to block new curbs on textile, apparel and shoe
imports approved by the Senate, even if it means a presidential
veto just weeks before the November elections.
   ``We will do everything in our power to make sure that it does
not become law,'' U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter said
Friday following 57-32 Senate approval of tighter import
restrictions.
   The bill is designed to protect American manufacturers from
foreign competition, primarily in newly industrialized Asian
countries.

   If the Reagan administration wins final
approval of its plan to allow China to launch U.S.-made
communications satellites, national security will be damaged and
the U.S. commercial space industry will be ``cut off at the

   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., whose district includes the U.S. space
launch center at Cape Canaveral, told reporters that chances to
overturn the decision in the few remaining days of the 100th
Congress are ``very slim.''
   ``We'll give it the old college try, but it will be very

   The Postal Service today is restoring the
window services it cut last February in a move that saved $40
million and helped cushion an expected $500 million deficit this
year for the U.S. mail system.
   Hours at post offices won't necessarily be the same as before
the cuts were imposed, however, with local managers allowed to make
changes that they think best serve their customers.
   Ordered by Congress to cut out $160 million in spending, the
Postal Service made a series of changes, including reducing window
hours at most offices by a half-day per week.

   Major environmental groups, some of them no
friends of the Reagan administration, have jumped to the defense of
federal forest firefighting policies attacked by some western
members of Congress.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., last week suggested that William
Penn Mott, director of the National Park Service, be fired for
following a ``let it burn'' policy in Yellowstone National Park.
   Environmental spokesmen accused Wallop of grandstanding and
called his suggestion ridiculous.
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, one of the three-member
inspection team sent by President Reagan to Yellowstone over the
weekend, has called the firefighting policy a ``disaster.''

   Following a political road map to battleground
states, Republican George Bush is zigzagging across America on a
made-for-television tour hinting at new policies to win support
from women and conservative Democrats.
   He concentrated last week on pivotal states _ California, Texas,
Illinois and Pennylvania _ in his quest for the 270 electoral votes
needed to capture the White House, and made passes through
Washington, Oregon and Kentucky.
   After a weekend resting in Washington, Bush returns to the
campaign trail Monday after announcing a national security advisory
task force that will include former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger, former U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Brent
Scowcroft, former White House national security adviser.

   With a few phrases under a hot East Texas sun,
Michael Dukakis displayed the combative, aggressive stance that
worried supporters have been beseeching him to display in his
lagging campaign against Republican George Bush.
   At the end of a week filled with calamities and plummeting
polls, the Democratic presidential nominee took on Bush in his
strongest language yet.
   Dukakis compared Bush's attacks, suggesting that he was short on
patriotism and soft on crime, to McCarthyism of the 1950s, and said
the American people could ``smell the garbage.''
   A surprise name on the list, according to campaign sources, will
be Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was President Carter's national
security adviser.
   From Washington, Bush will head for some major industrial states
on an itinerary that includes New Jersey, Illinois, Missouri,
California and Ohio before he returns home by Friday.

   Money-losing Eastern Airlines eliminated 4,000 more
jobs Saturday in the ``downsizing'' it says it needs to survive,
but the unions charged that the cutbacks are actually making the
airline less competitive.
   The cuts, which are being contested in court by the unions,
reduced Eastern's workforce to fewer than 30,000. Less than four
years ago, it had 42,000 workers.
   Eastern eliminated 12 percent of its routes two weeks ago,
ending service to 14 cities.
   Laid-off workers with seniority can transfer to other cities,
``bumping'' newer employees out of their jobs. Thus, newer
employees could take the brunt of the layoffs when the bumping is
complete.

   Faced with $1 million-a-day fines and
layoffs of hundreds of municipal workers, the City Council approved
a court-ordered housing desegregation plan Saturday after two
members switched their votes.
   As an emotional crowd looked on, the council approved the plan
by a 5-2 vote about 1:30 a.m., after a month in which escalating
fines for refusing to endorse the plan threatened the state's
fourth-largest city with bankruptcy.
   Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, head of the state board that
took control of the city's finances, suspended the layoffs of 447
city employees after the vote.
   Two of the four councilmen who had long opposed the plan voted
for it after city officials negotiated a modified plan with the
NAACP that would mix some of the low-income units ordered by the
court with more expensive ones.

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ On the 15th anniversary of the bloody coup
that installed him ``only for as long as circumstances demand,''
President Gen. Augusto Pinochet is eagerly pursuing a new
eight-year mandate.
   He remains firmly in control of the military. But an
increasingly unified and confident opposition predicts his
political demise before the anniversary rolls around again next
year.
   Commander of the country's fiercely disciplined army, Pinochet
led the Sept. 11, 1973, coup that toppled the elected government of
a Marxist, Salvador Allende, during a period of widespread social
and economic upheaval.
   A decade and a half later, Pinochet has launched a huge campaign
to persuade his countrymen that circumstances demand he remain in
power until 1997 and that they they must vote accordingly in an
Oct. 5 presidential referendum.

   Postmaster General Anthony Frank wants to
bring America's generations closer together, and if that brings the
Post Office a little extra business he won't mind.
   ``Plant a Family Tree'' is the name of Frank's plan, in which
millions of family history forms will be given out, in hopes that
youngsters will write to their grandparents seeking information to
fill them out.
   ``Letters provide an important link between families.
Grandparents often meet their grandchildren through an exchange of
letters and photographs long before they see each other
face-to-face,'' Frank said.
   As part of the family tree program the Postal Service has
printed millions of folders which discuss family histories on one
side and contain a genealogical form on the back to fill in
information on parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.

   Except for choosing texts and shaping the
curriculum, most teachers feel left out of critical decisions
affecting classroom life, according to a nationwide poll released
Saturday.
   Ten percent or fewer of 21,698 public school teachers surveyed
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancment of Teaching felt they
had any say in issues like teacher evaluation or selection of new
teachers and administrators. Just 20 percent believed they were
influential in tailoring school budgets.
   ``The report endorses what I have often said _ that teachers are
treated like very tall children instead of professionals,'' said
Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teacher union with 1.9 million

   This year's deluge _ the most devastating in memory _ has

simultaneously in 128 countries at 11 a.m. EDT.
   From remote island outposts to the crowded streets of London,
New York, Moscow and Hong Kong, young and old will don ``I Changed

   Willis ``Be Bop'' Edwards goes wherever
blues great B.B. King travels. The two men have been inseparable
since 1952 when King got into Edwards' taxi in Houston, Texas.
   ``I'm right there with the band every day. I'm writing a book,
`B.B. King, Then and Now,''' Edwards said in an interview at his
home in Mobile.
   King is 64. Edwards, a great-grandfather of four, will be 65 in
November. Neither plans to retire soon.
   ``He stays polished,'' Edwards said.
   Edwards, now the singer's road manager, began as his valet.
   ``I was driving a taxi cab for a studio. This guy that owned the
cab line owned a couple of recording companies. He had me go to the
hotel and take King to his lawyer's office to sign the papers to
start recording.''
   Edwards parked his cab that day and left with King.
   ``From that date to this one, I've been with him.''
   King started in the early days playing black clubs around the
country.
   ``That was from the '50s until the early part of the '60s,''
Edwards said. ``King's fortunes changed when he guest-starred with
Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin at Fillmore West (in
San Francisco). When he made the record, `The Thrill Is Gone,' that
was the major change.
   ``The crowd now is 75 to 80 percent white. Deep South, the crowd
is more black,'' Edwards said. ``It varies with the territory.''
   Edwards moved to Mobile 25 years ago and began operating
restaurants and nightclubs. Everything was called ``Be Bop's'' _
record shop, social club, chicken shack and lately his tamale plaza.
   ``We sell hot tamales and boudin (a Cajun sausage with rice).
The tamales come from Mississippi, the boudin is from New
Orleans,'' he said.
   When he gets the call from Polly Walker, King's secretary in
Memphis, Tenn., Edwards goes on the road. Her husband, Cato, who
died this summer, was King's long-time bus driver, and her two
daughters worked for King. She said they all have been friends for
life.
   ``I grew up across the street from King's house in Memphis,''
Mrs. Walker said.
   Edwards has been with King the longest of his co-workers. He
takes his wife, Lillie, with him on concert trips when possible.
Bus driver Barnett Fogg has been with them 11 years, and tenor sax
Eddie Synagal has nine years with the group.
   The King show has made two European trips this year, in March
and July. Edwards said they hit 29 cities. ``Every day it was a
different language, different money, different food,'' Edwards said.
   ``I've been going to Europe for the last 20 years. I'm going
twice again before Christmas.''
   Edwards doesn't play any instrument. ``I don't handle nothing
but money and writing checks. But I know music, I've got to know
music to hire and fire.''
   King, he said, is all blues: ``If B.B. King sang the national
anthem, it would be bluesy.''
   King, who lives in Las Vegas, Nev., rose to fame from humble
bginnings in Indianola, Miss. With a New York agent, his
performance itinerary runs nearly year-round.
   ``He's got people, family all over the United States,'' Edwards
said.
   He said King's favorite place is his home in Las Vegas, but King
recently purchased a new bus manufactured in Belgium. ``It took
them nine months to make it to B.B. King's specifications. The same
thing that's in a Stouffer's hotel is in that bus.
   ``When we're traveling down the highway, people take pictures of
it from their cars,'' Edwards said.
   The group does as much flying as bus travel. That's all in stark
contrast to the early days, when the band got around in a few
station wagons and a Cadillac. Back then, they were worried about
being able to use public restrooms because they were segregated and
black people were not permitted to use them.
   Edwards said he has kept Mobile as his home base because of his
family and business interests. He has stayed despite the lack of
major entertainment _ blues or jazz.
   ``The people here are not ready for it,'' he said. ``They won't
support it. A lot of people notice it, but it's the less supporting
entertainment city in the world. For what reason, I don't know.''

   Biba Abdou's children, all skin and bones,
were smiling from ear-to-ear as they played beside the family's
10-food-high millet crop, the best they had ever seen.
   ``My boys are skinny now, but soon they will be fat,'' said Mrs.
Biba, whose family farms near Karma, about 35 miles northwest of
Niger's capital, Niamey. ``We have never seen rain like this. We
are very content.''
   For the moment, a drought-weary people have reason to smile.
   All across West Africa's Sahel, abundant rains promise the best
harvest in two decades.
   Nothing comes easy in the Sahel, a huge belt of land on the
southern fringe of the Sahara, and the good rains are no exception.
More than 100 lives were lost in torrential rains, thousands of
homes destroyed and some farmland flooded. An infestation of
locusts also threatens some crops, although the most immediate
threat appears to be to the east in Sudan.
   The Niger River rose to levels higher than any recorded in
August since record-keeping began in 1928.
   Scientists at a Niamey agricultural weather center, set up to
monitor conditions in nine Sahel nations after the disastrous
1972-73 drought, report the plentiful rain promises good harvests.
Good pasturage is available for cattle, goats, sheep.
   The Sahel region is generally defined as covering the land south
of the Sahara with annual rainfall averaging from six to 24 inches.
It stretches from Mauritania, Mali and Niger in the north into
northern Nigeria and northern Cameroon in the south.
   Many Sahel regions had already received more than 14 inches, the
amount needed for millet crops, by the end of August. More
important, the rain had continued to fall since the beginning of
June. The crop needs rainfall throughout its three-month growth for
the best harvests.
   The Sahel nations _ Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Senegal, Niger,
Mauritania, Mali, Chad, Guinea Bissau and Gambia _ have suffered
recurring drought or generally inadequate rainfall since 1972. The
nine nations cover more than 2 million square miles and have a
population of about 40 million.
   Amadou Djibo, who farms with his father and three brothers about
60 miles northwest of Niamey, said people weren't concerned about
losing their homes or flooding that had temporarily cut off an
important road. Like the marabou storks who circled overhead, the
rains were considered a harbinger of better days.
   ``We can always rebuild a house, but if we have no rain, we have
no food,'' he said.
   Djibo added that his village of Zarakoire, had not had an
adequate harvest in seven years and life was hard.
   Boukar Elhadj Ousmane, Niger's minister in charge of animal and
water resources, said the rains had left 13 people dead and 7,000
homeless. He also reported 15,000 animals, including goats, sheep
and cattle, lost and about 600 miles of roads left temporarily
impassable.
   Heavy rainfall has been reported across West Africa, extending
into Sudan in East Africa where torrential rains and flooding
resulted in 96 deaths and $200 million in damage.
   In the Sahel, Chad reported 45 people dead and 48,000 homeless
and 3,500 cattle lost. More than 50 people were killed in northern
Nigeria and thousands left homeless; two dams burst after the
heaviest rainfalls in 50 years. Cameroon and Burkina Faso also
reported several deaths and many houses destroyed.
   Much flood damage was reported near rivers, where people had
moved in close to the water during drought years to plant gardens.
   Boukar said he could understand the attitude of peasants who
minimized the importance of the damage, and said, ``We can consider
the rain a blessing.''
   He added, ``It gives them hope for the future. Many of those
people have never seen this kind of rain in their lives. They have
only heard stories about it.''
   George Eaton, Niger's director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development (AID), which was still distributing food
donated to meet shortfalls from the last harvest, said Niger's food
situation should be good after this harvest.
   ``That's if the locusts don't eat it all, or if there is so much
there is still enough for the people.'' Eaton said he had received
reports of good harvest prospects from AID directors in other Sahel
nations.
   ``This has been a great morale booster, even with the locust
threat,'' he added. ``People are upbeat.''
   Some harvesting already has begun in southern Sahel regions,
where crops mature earlier. But in most areas millet, sorghum and
other crops will be harvested in the coming weeks.
   No one predicts an end to food shortages, though given the
probable reduction in U.S. food aid because of the U.S. drought the
Sahel rains were timely. Each Sahel country has its own troubles,
and the rain certainly would create some problems, even if it
alleviated others.
   And no one predicts that the drought cycle had been broken by
the rains. Indeed, scientists here would make no predictions at
all, noting a meterological institute had predicted three months
ago that the Sahel would experience a very dry year this year.
   Aid workers expressed concern the good rains will encourage
pastoralists to rebuild their herds, cut by as much as 50 percent
by the massive 1984 drought, to sizes the land can't support.
Overgrazing has been a key factor in desertification, the process
by which the Sahara claims land.
   A pastoralist's herd remains his bank and chief wealth in the
Sahel and governments have had little success dissuading their
herdsmen from overgrazing the fragile land.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Election Focuses on Commonwealth Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELEN J. SIMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Puerto Ricans vote for a governor,
legislators, mayors and a non-voting member of the U.S. Congress on
the same day mainland Americans pick a new president. But an
underlining issue here is the seemingly never-ending debate over
the island's 36-year-old commonwealth relationship with the United
States.
   Puerto Rico's three main political parties _ distinguished from
each other primarily by their support for commonwealth, statehood
or independence _ all are seeking changes in what some of them see
as the island's semicolonial status.
   The outcome of elections here Nov. 8 is likely to hinge more on
personalities and issues such as unemployment than on Puerto Rico's
political status, analysts say.
   But both incumbent governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, the
commonwealth candidate, and his statehood rival, Mayor Baltasar
Corrada del Rio of San Juan, have pledged to hold a status
referendum after the election.
   The issue has featured prominently in the campaign so far.
   It would be the first such referendum since 1967, when 60
percent of the voters favored a continuation of the commonwealth
arrangement, 39 percent statehood and 1 percent independence.
   Puerto Rico, an island of 3.3 million mostly Spanish-speaking
people 1,000 miles southeast of Miami, has flown the U.S. flag
since 1898, when Spain ceded it to the United States at the end of
the Spanish-American War.
   The modern-day commonwealth arrangement, which went into effect
in July 1952, gives Puerto Rico roughly as much control over its
own affairs as any of the 50 states.
   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, but they pay no U.S. taxes and
cannot vote for president. Nevertheless, they are eligible for U.S.
military service and Social Security and welfare benefits.
   Puerto Rico receives substantial U.S. aid _ $6.5 billion this
year alone _ and U.S. companies, taking advantage of tax
exemptions, have given the island one of the strongest economies in
Latin America.
   In return, the United States uses Puerto Rico as a strategic
base for naval operations and an important market for U.S. goods.
   ``The reality of the relationship, as it is now,''
pro-commonwealth commentator Alex W. Maldonado wrote in the
English-language San Juan Star, ``is enormously beneficial to
Puerto Rico. Despite monumental efforts of President Reagan and
Congress to cut domestic spending to reduce the gigantic federal
deficit, the flow of funds to the island has continued to grow.''
   Yet, there is dissatisfaction on all sides. Commonwealth
supporters want more say in running the island; statehooders
complain of being treated as second-class citizens; and the
independence movement fervently _ at times violently _ seeks
undiluted Puerto Rican sovereignty.
   Hernandez Colon, 51, who is seeking his third four-year term,
favors continued commonwealth status but wants Washington to
relinquish control over immigration, foreign trade and certain
environmental and labor matters.
   His Popular Democratic Party has announced plans for a
referendum sometime after the election seeking ``maximum autonomy''
for Puerto Rico. But the party has not specified what the term
means.
   Corrada del Rio's New Progressive Party, which wants Puerto Rico
to become the 51st U.S. state, says its referendum would ask voters
whether Puerto Rico should begin negotiations with the United
States on statehood. If approved, the referendum would be followed
by a second vote on any negotiated formula.
   The tiny Independence Party, which hasn't won more than 6
percent of the vote in 20 years, proposes an election of a
multiparty assembly to resolve the sovereignty question and
negotiate a solution with Washington.
   Regardless of the outcome, the election is unlikely to resolve
the status issue. The statehood party has twice held the governor's
office since it was founded in 1967, but has made no effort to
achieve statehood while in power.
   Hernandez Colon, who has stressed his administration's economic
record rather than the status issue, is favored to win, but it
could be close.
   An opinion poll of 600 registered voters carried out for San
Juan's Channel 2 television station in July put the incumbent
governor 5 points ahead of Corrada del Rio _ 45 percent to 40
percent _ with 4 percent backing the Independence Party's Ruben
Berrios and the rest undecided. The poll had a margin of error of
plus or minus 4.3 percent.

   Five-year-old Sergio Neal was lucky to
survive a fire that destroyed the small apartment where he lived
with his mother and two sisters.
   And he was fortunate to receive prompt, expert care to treat
second- and third-degree burns over most of his face, his hands and
chest, and part of his arms and head.
   But Sergio, featured recently in a Newsweek article looking at
the tragic ramifications of living in poverty, is still very much
in need.
   His face was pitifully disfigured by the flames, and he has not
regained full movement of his hands.
   He and his 2-year-old sister, Shakeriay, who was not as
seriously injured, spent a month at a Shriners' burn institute in
Cincinnati, Ohio, after the December incident in this rural Orlando
suburb, just a few miles down the road from Walt Disney World.
   The Newsweek story last month prompted offers of assistance from
around the country, some for medical care and reconstructive
surgery. A volunteer organization in Apopka has set up a
fund-raising account for the Neals.
   A 6-year-old girl from New Jersey sent Newsweek a letter
containing two $1 bills and two nickels with a note saying: ``Would
you please give this to Sergio?''
   The fire started after the children's mother, Audrey Neal,
stepped out briefly to a neighboring apartment, leaving Sergio and
Shakeriay in the living room. One of them evidently played with a
cigarette lighter, and fire quickly engulfed the small apartment.
   Would-be rescuers found one of the doors to the apartment
boarded up; they could not get the knob on the other door to work.
   Hearing the children's screams and frantic, fruitless efforts to
open the front door, Ms. Neal and neighbors finally broke through
the door, fought the flames and carried the children out just as
firefighters arrived. Rescue workers administered emergency medical
treatment and rushed them to an Orlando hospital.
   A day after the blaze, Sergio and his sister were flown in
separate Learjet ambulances _ complete with a doctor, nurse and
medical technician in each plane _ from Orlando to the Shrine
facility in Cincinnati.
   After their month's stay, Sergio has continued to get outpatient
care two or three times a month. All of this expensive,
sophisticated treatment has been provided free by the Shriners
under their generous programs for needy burned and crippled
children around the country.
   Still, until Sergio gets older, there is little doctors can do
about his scarred and pitted face.
   ``Much of the reconstructive surgery has to wait until bone
growth stops, probably around the age of 16,'' says Victor Clark,
children's director of the Bahia Shrine Temple in Orlando, who
arranged for the Neals' treatment, transportation and continuing
visits to the Cincinnati facility.
   ``But we're prepared to help him as long as he needs it, up to
the age of 21,'' says Clark.
   While Sergio's continuing medical treatment for his physical
injuries is ensured, there is some worry about his other,
not-so-obvious problems and needs: the mental anguish, which is
difficult to determine in a young child; his education, and the
home care necessary before plastic surgery.
   He now wears a plastic face mask, which Clark says puts pressure
on facial scar tissue to make it grow sideways to decrease its
thickness.
   Because of his facial disfigurement, his mother is keeping him
out of school and hopes to get him on a program that provides a
visiting teacher for homebound students.
   So while other kids his age are starting school, Sergio is
spending hours in front of a TV or playing and squabbling with his
two sisters and four cousins in the two-bedroom apartment where
they now live.
   Sergio's mother and her three children moved in with her sister
Shawana and her four kids after the fire.
   ``The basic problem is that they are so poor they have no
resources for anything,'' says social activist Cathy Moore about
the Neal family.
   ``For one thing, here are seven children and two adults living
in a tiny apartment. And now the landlord has given them an
eviction notice.''
   Ms. Moore, director of a volunteer organization known as SMILE,
for Single Mothers In a Learning Experience, said Audrey Neal's
family would like to move out but can't afford to do so.
   ``Sergio's mother gets less than $350 a month in AFDC,'' the
state's Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Ms. Moore said,
whereas she'd need an annual income of $15,000 to qualify under a
federally subsidized low-income housing program.
   Ms. Moore set up the fund-raising account for the Neals to help
them with housing, and home health care and education for Sergio.
   Meanwhile, Winter Park attorney Russell Troutman, one of the
founders of a legal-aid office for the poor in the Apopka area,
said he was looking into the possibility of a liability lawsuit
over the allegedly defective doorknob in the Neal apartment.
   ``As I understand it, the kiddies were trying their best to open
the door during the fire but the doorknob wouldn't work,'' he said.
``We're looking into it.''
   The Sergio Neal case is just one example of how people tend to
overlook those in need until disaster strikes, Ms. Moore said,
adding that articles like the one in Newsweek just scratch the
surface of the problem.
   ``I hope we realize poverty is all around us,'' she said, ``that
it's not always something hidden behind the scenes.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter is rallying other
nations' heads of state and health officials to eradicate a
debilitating disease that infects 10 million people and disrupts
agriculture in the Third World.
   Carter has also persuaded the World Health Organization to
target guinea worm disease, which sometimes has fatal
complications, as the second disease _ after smallpox _ that the
agency seeks to wipe out worldwide.
   He became concerned about the readily preventable disease
through a famine relief program sponsored by Global 2000, a public
health foundation headquartered at the Carter Presidential Center
in Atlanta.
   The program, whose primary goal is to improve yield for farmers'
crops, found that agriculture in many remote areas was hampered
because the cyclical worm disease strikes so many people in the
spring, sickening them at planting season.
   The disease itself is sickening to describe. In spring, infected
people find the worm _ a yard-long, stringlike creature _ painfully
emerging from boils that form in soft tissue between the toes or
elsewhere on the body, having completed its growth cycle inside its
human host. It enters the body through contaminated water.
   Seeing the ailment's devastation is ``heartrending,'' Carter
said in a telephone interview from his home in Plains. ``And just
to realize that, with a simple education program and very simple
prevention techiques, this affliction could be eliminated forever.''
   Last spring, he and his wife, Rosalynn, visited heavily infected
villages in the West African nation of Ghana. ``The first village
we went to had a population of 500 and they had 213 people
stretched out on the ground under the kasha trees for us just to
see and to meet,'' Carter said.
   ``When we talked to the village elders and chiefs, they didn't
have any idea what caused guinea worm. They thought it might come
from the praying mantis or from drinking the blood of goats or from
some superstition like the confluence of the planets or that it was
a punishment of the gods to test their endurance,'' he said.
   ``They didn't have any idea it came from drinking filthy water.
Then we went down to look at the water hole that was their only
source of drinking water. It was covered with scum and the people
had to wade out I'd say at least knee deep before they could get a
bucket full of water,'' he said.
   Some of the waders were infected and entered the water to ease
their pain.
   When the emerging guinea worm comes in contact with water, it
spews out its larvae which are then eaten by a microscopic animal
called a cyclops.
   Villagers drink the water contaminated with cyclops and the
cyclops die in their bodies, leaving behind the larvae to grow into
worms. Infections caused when the worm dies inside the body can be
fatal, though that is rare, Carter said.
   In the first worm eradication program undertaken by Global 2000,
in Pakistan, foundation workers developed inexpensive techniques
for breaking the creature's 12-month life cycle.
   Carter said the infestations can be prevented by replacing water
holes with deep wells, ``but that costs $700 or $800 and we don't
have $700 or $800 for every village in Africa.''
   Other preventive measures include keeping people out of the
water holes or having all villagers strain their water for a full
year. But widespread illiteracy makes it difficult to educate the
people at risk.
   Still, with the support and participation of the Pakistani
government, Global 2000's eradication program is going so well that
Carter predicted the disease would be eliminated there by 1990.
   Full-scale programs have started in Ghana and Nigeria in the
last year and a new program is about to begin in Uganda.
   ``One of the things that I can contribute as a former president
is to go not to an assistant minister of health, who may not have
much influence or may not know anything about health to start with,
but I go directly to the king or the president or the prime
minister and ask him to bring his Cabinet members together,''
Carter said.
   The news media attention his involvement receives also helps
educate potential victims about the disease.
   ``It's a gratifying thing to see a village that was formerly
devastated five or six months a year from guinea worm to emerge
after a couple of years with no guinea worm and live a happy,
prosperous and healthy life,'' Carter said.
   ``In the process, to be frank about it, it puts America forward
as an enlightened, concerned and peace-loving nation.''

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Say They'd Be Accessible Presidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael
Dukakis have issued matching promises of accessibility to the White
House press, but neither was saying how often he would hold formal
presidential news conferences.
   The rival presidential nominees made their statements on news
and information policies in written responses to inquiries by the
Freedom of Information Committee of The Associated Press Managing
Editors Association.
   Their replies were made public as APME officers and committee
chairmen met in New York on Monday.
   ``I hope words like `accessible,' `candid,' `honest' and `fair'
will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with the media
by historians,'' Republican Bush said. ``It certainly is what I
will strive for during my tenure as president.''
   The Reagan administration has come under frequent criticism for
limiting access to information.
   Dukakis renewed that criticism. The Democratic nominee prefaced
his comments on his plans with a charge that ``the Reagan-Bush
administration has waged an assault on the Freedom of Information
Act with every weapon in its arsenal.''
   Dukakis said he has a proven record of accessibility to
reporters, and would continue on that course as president.
   ``Throughout my public career I've believed in a free press and
my record shows I've practiced that belief,'' he said. ``As
president, I would hope to continue this pattern of accessibility
to the White House press corps, giving them and me the opportunity
to utilize our First Amendment freedoms.
   A questionnaire prepared for the FOI committee was given to both
candidates. Bush responded directly, answering each of the
questions. Dukakis replied by issuing a two-part position paper,
with one section on the freedom of information law and a second on
his press relations.
   Here is a partial transcript of their replies:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. As president, what sort of tone would you set regarding
openness in government, access to government information and
freedom of information?
   A. Within the limits of national security, government should be
open to scrutiny by the media and the public. Ours is a democracy
where goverment must be accountable to the people. The
information-gathering process, from a news conference to the
Freedom of Information Act, is vital and essential to our system of
democracy.
   Q. What kind of relationship do you think you've had with the
media during your public career? How would you seek to improve it,
if at all?
   A. I think I have had a good relationship with the media. As
president, I hope that I will be able to spend more time talking
with smaller groups of reporters. I enjoy a good give and take, and
that kind of format allows me to get to know reporters a little
better and them to know me. Not only will this benefit reporters
but, more importantly, such free exchange will ultimately benefit
the general public as well.
   Q. Throughout history, presidents have had a variety of
relationships with the media. Are there any styles you would
emulate? Are there any you would avoid? When it comes time to write
the history of your relations with the media, what will it say?
   A. With the media, the Congress or the public, it would be a
mistake to attempt to be something or someone you're not. So, warts
and all, what you see is what you'll get.
   I hope words like ``accessible,'' ``candid,'' ``honest'' and
``fair'' will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with
the media by historians. It certainly is what I will strive for
during my tenure as president. ...
   Q. How frequently would you meet with reporters? How would you
conduct press conferences? How often would you hold press
conferences? Would you make any changes in the way President Reagan
has done his press conferences?
   A. There are a number of ways to communicate with both the media
and the public. Press conferences are one important way and they
would certainly be central to my effort to ensure accessibility in
my administration. One-on-one and group interviews, satellite
interviews with regional media, national televised addresses are
other examples of methods that a president can and should use to
provide the media with opportunities to discuss administration
policies and programs.
   My goal would be to get the right ``mix'' of all of the options
available to guarantee an open administration. Realistically, you
can't put a number on any of the working parts of an open approach
to accessibility, but you can make and keep a commitment to the
goal itself.
   Q. More specifically, what message will you send to your
executive agencies regarding Freedom of Information requests?
   A. My message will be simple: obey the law. ...
   Q. Here's a chance to offer some contructive criticism. What
things would you most like to change about the news media? What
should the nation's media do differently to better serve the public
interest?
   A. Accuracy and fairness are the name of the game. The media
goes to great lengths to be accurate. It needs to go to the same
lengths to be fair. While it is often necessary to use unnamed
sources in gathering information for a story, it puts the validity
of a story at a disadvantage. I hope the news media would rely as
little as possible on this approach to information gathering and
reporting.

   Q. What sort of individual do you see putting in the job of
White House spokesperson? How much access would the spokesman have
to administration thinking and information? Do you condone Larry
Speakes' practice of manufacturing quotes?
   A. The job of White House press secretary is one of the toughest
in any administration and a number of qualities are important. A
press secretary must be honest, ethical, steady, candid with both
the media and the president and experienced, with an understanding
of the media and its needs. A sense of humor doesn't hurt either.
   If access is important to reporters, it is absolutely vital to a
press secretary. ... I understand that to function effectively a
press secretary must have a first-hand knowledge of a President's
policies and positions. ...
   Finally, on the third question: no.
   Q. How much access do you believe reporters ought to have to the
White House staff? How free would your staff be to talk on the
record to reporters?
   A. The Bush Administration will be an open one. That doesn't
mean every staff member will be authorized to serve as an
administration spokesman or interpreter of events and policies. The
best interests of the government, media and public aren't observed
by the confusion and misinformation that usually results from that
kind of policy.
   Not in every instance but in most, if something can't be said on
the record, it's probably better left unsaid. ...
   Q. What would be your policy on allowing media coverage of
military actions (a la Grenada)? Do you support the pool approach
worked out and used in the Persian Gulf exercises, or do you
believe reporters and photographers ought to have even freer access
to military operations?
   A. Certainly, the public has a right to know the details of
military operations in an appropriate time frame and in a way that
does not risk national security. The current relationship between
the military and the press is workable and I support it. But that
safety of the troops and the success of the mission must be
paramount, and I will risk neither.

   Freedom of Information: For the past eight years, the
Reagan-Bush administration has waged an assault on the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) with every weapon in its arsenal _ executive
orders, budget cuts, fee guidelines and legislative proposals.
Their objective is clear: to gut a statute whose fundamental
premise is that American citizens have the right to know about the
activities of their own government.
   The current administration claims that complying with the FOIA
is too time-consuming, too expensive and too bothersome. These are
excuses for government secrecy. And they could serve as a cloak for
incompetence, mismanagement, illegality or corruption. ...
   As president, I will implement the FOIA in the spirit which
Congress intended. From Vietnam to Watergate to Iran-Contra, we
Americans have learned what happens when government operates in
secrecy, accountable to no one. A Dukakis administration will treat
requesters of information as clients, not as burdens. For only in
an atmosphere of the fullest possible disclosure can the American
people retain confidence in their government.
   Relations with the press: Throughout my public career I've
believed in a free press and my record shows I've practiced that
belief. As governor for nearly 10 years, I have been accessible to
State House reporters several times a week. I enjoy the spirited
give and take of news conferences and the vigorous exchange of an
interview. More important, I understand and appreciate the role of
the news media in a free society as laid out two centuries ago in
the Bill of Rights to the Constitution.
   As president, I would hope to continue this pattern of
accessibility to the White House press corps, giving them and me
the opportunity to utilize our First Amendment freedoms.

<HEAD>Analysts See Dividend Growth as a Bright Spot in Dull Market</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Investors may be dissatisfied with the progress
of stock prices lately, but they should be pleased with rising
dividends.
   That's the case being argued these days by analysts who argue
that the ``boring'' stock market of 1988 has actually produced more
generous rewards than its notices would suggest.
   When Standard & Poor's Corp. estimated recently that
corporations might increase their dividends by as much as 10
percent this year, little loud cheering was heard on Wall Street.
   ``Dividends provide half the total return earned by common
stocks historically, yet Wall Street traditionally ignores them,''
observed Paul Kuper, executive vice president at the Centre Square
Investment Group in Philadelphia.
   ``But watch out, Wall Street. Dividends and, more particularly,
dividend growth are likely to take a front seat with investors as
the 5- to 6-percent growth rate of the last five years doubles to
10- to 12-percent over the next few years.''
   It isn't hard to figure out why dividends didn't command as much
attention as capital gains when the typical investor thought about
the stock market in recent years.
   If you tried to talk about dividends in the heady 1982-87 bull
market, you most likely would have been laughed out of the room.
And in the subsequent crash last fall, the furthest thing from
anybody's mind was a quarterly dividend check.
   In any financial season, most professional money managers and
brokers aren't paid by their clients to generate dividends.
   However, analysts who have delved into the subject say that to
dismiss dividends as irrelevant misses the point.
   ``We have always considered yield to be a bedrock indicator of
value,'' asserts John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It is a hard number, unlike earnings or book value, which may
exist only in the mind of an accountant.
   ``Declaring a dividend involves a cash payment. It is not a
decision that is taken lightly.''
   The dividend bulls base their optimism on several factors,
starting with the strong trend in corporate earnings that helps
give boards of directors the option of voting dividend increases.
   Furthermore, says Kuper at Centre Square, companies recently
have been paying out less than 40 percent of their earnings as
dividends, which is close to a historic low. A normal rate, he
says, is more like 50 percent.
   The Tax Reform Act of 1986, he adds, provided a spur to
dividends since it eliminated the special tax treatment of
long-term capital gains. That means that dividends now have an
equal value with capital gains for taxpaying investors.
   Based on his estimates for 1989, Connolly figures the aggregate
yield on the Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks
projects to 4.1 percent.
   ``Contrast that with the mere 2.6 percent available at the
market top last year,'' he says.
   ``These numbers are unlikely to make anyone's adrenaline flow,''
he acknowledges. ``Stocks are bought for appreciation, not yield.
   ``But we are more interested in value than pizzazz at this
stage, and 4.1 percent is a comfortable number.''
   For the first two-thirds of 1988, Connolly adds, the S&P 500 was
up about 7 percent. ``Since the yield is about 4 percent, total
return is 11 percent.
   ``This compares well with the 10 percent (annual) long-term
return on stocks. Boring might not be so bad.''

<HEAD>Stephen Collins Has Leading Man and Character Role in Nick
Tattinger</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Stephen Collins, who aspires to be a
character actor but finds himself in a leading man's body, Nick
Tattinger might just be the perfect role.
   Nick, the hero of NBC's new ``Tattinger's,'' is a two-fisted,
up-from-the-streets entrepreneur who has become one of the swells
by virtue of owning an exclusive Manhattan restaurant. He's a
good-looking, charming guy, but he's also quite a character.
   The show, filmed on location in New York, premieres Oct. 26.
   Over lunch at a midtown Indian restaurant, Collins, 41, said
that until recently he would not have been the man for the part. In
fact, he said, unbeknownst to him, he was rejected for it when the
show's co-creator, Bruce Paltrow, was first kicking around the idea
a few years ago.
   ``Evidently at the time, I had no idea, my name came up, and he
said, `No, he's too young and he's not right for it, he's not what
we're looking for at all,''' Collins said.
   But more recently, after attending a cocktail party at the home
of his friend Blythe Danner, who happens to be Paltrow's wife,
Collins got a call from Paltrow.
   ``He said, `I'm sending you this script because my wife thinks
that you can play the central character.' Blythe had not said a
word to me. ... What Blythe had, I guess, said to him was, `He's a
little older and he's a little rougher around the edges, and I
think he'd be interested in playing this part.' I read it and
immediately knew.''
   Danner co-stars in the series as Nick's socialite ex-wife,
Hillary.
   ``I've done a few things I'm proud of _ not enough _ but I've
done a few things I'm proud of,'' said Collins, ``and the common
denominator of all of them is that when I read the script, it's
like I can visualize the character, ... but I don't get all
involved in the image of what the character is. And it's usually a
character part. Nick is really a character part. It won't look like
that to a lot of people because I'm playing it, and people have me
tagged.''
   To illustrate the kind of guy Nick is, Collins opens a script
and turns to a scene between Nick and Norman (Simon Jones),
Hillary's lover. Nick says Norman is a better father than he is, a
good person.
   ``Nick doesn't see himself as a very good person,'' Collins
said, ``and he's not in a lot of ways. Norman says, `That's not
enough.' Nick says, `It's gotta be.' Norm says, `Oh, sure, you can
say that looking like you do, but what about the rest of us with
thinning hair and baggy eyes?' Nick says, `Everybody thinks my life
is so fabulous. Let me tell you something, being back in New York,
surrounded by the facts ... all I see is what I lost, what I threw
away. Getting it back in tiny pieces here and there stinks.' Then
he says, `You hear violins?'
   ``That's the way he feels about his life. It's like he's really
come to a crisis point in this life. It's really fun to play
someone who doesn't have all the answers.''
   Collins, who was born in Iowa but grew up in and around New York
City, has always been pegged as a leading-man type. He works often
on the stage and has just written his first play.
   His film credits can almost be divided down the line between
small parts in good pictures, such as ``All the President's Men''
and ``Between the Lines,'' and bigger parts in sillier, if
commercially successful movies like ``Star Trek: The Motion
Picture'' and ``Brewster's Millions.''
   He is a frequent presence in TV movies and miniseries and got a
1987 Emmy nomination for his supporting role as Ann-Margret's cad
husband in ``The Two Mrs. Grenvilles.''
   Collins, occasionally brushing back his longish blond hair, says
when he considers it objectively, he has to conclude that his looks
have helped as much as hurt his career.
   ``I think everybody, however they look, they take their looks
for granted, so it's not news to me if people see me that way,'' he
said. ``And so what I remember as an actor is the number of times
people have said to me, literally, `Oh, you gave the best reading,
we thought yours was the best reading, but we need somebody who's
not a leading-man type for this part. We need somebody with more
character.' That's part of the reason it's so much fun to play this
part, because you need a little of both to play Nick.''

<HEAD>`Animal Spirits' May Move the Stock Market</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the first anniversary of the stock market
crash approaches, some economists are advancing a new explanation
for the $500 billion jolt: animal spirits.
   ``Animal spirits'' is a shorthand phrase for emotion, unreason
and other qualities that _ to be fair to animals _ are really more
typical of human beings than the lower beasts.
   Most people have figured all along that emotion affects the
stock market, but for economists to say the same thing amounts to a
major shift.
   Economists were indoctrinated to believe that financial markets
adjust quickly and smoothly to changes in the rational expectations
of investors. At any given moment, in other words, stock prices
reflect the perfect collective wisdom of millions of investors.
   There were some doubts about the so-called efficient markets
theory even before Black Monday. There were a lot afterward. After
all, nothing happened in the real world on Oct. 19 to reduce the
true value of corporate America by nearly a quarter, which is how
much stocks fell that day.
   That's where animal spirits come in. Or ``fads,'' or ``secular
bubbles,'' depending on which economist is coining slogans.
   Evidence has accumulated that the Oct. 19 stock crash was in
large part the result of portfolio insurance, a computerized
strategy that triggers avalanches by dumping more and more stocks
the further they fall.
   Emotion played a small part that day because many of the
supposedly emotional small investors either sat tight or couldn't
get their sell orders through.
   Still, animal spirits and crowd psychology help explain why
investors bid stocks up so unreasonably high in the first place,
setting themselves up for a fall.
   Stock prices are supposed to go up when the economy is doing
well, reflecting the outlook for rising corporate profits. But the
relation is so haphazard that one economist has even been able to
conclude the opposite: that stocks and bonds do best when the
economy is doing worst.
   ``Stock market rallies start in the middle of recessions,'' said
Aubrey Zaffuto, an economist at IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Co.
   Ms. Zaffuto theorizes that when the economy slows down, there is
unused money sloshing around that is parked in financial assets,
driving up their value.
   The bad-is-good view is disputed by most economists, but the
fact that it even exists shows the weakness of the correlation
between stocks and the real world.
   ``I don't want to go so far as to say there's no connection
between the stock market and the economy. But what that
(connection) is remains in dispute,'' said John Campbell, an
economist at Princeton University.
   Campbell is more sympathetic to the efficient markets theorists
than some of his colleagues, such as Yale University's Robert
Shiller and Harvard University's Gregory Mankiw, who lean toward
the faddist school.
   But he said, ``To tell you the truth, I'm a little puzzled. ...
For a while, academics at least believed you could explain all
movements in the stock market by expectations of future dividends,
perhaps adjusted a bit for real interest rates.
   ``People have become more humble. That's progress of a kind, but
it's not much progress toward a solution.''

<HEAD>HDTV Ruling May Give U.S. Chance To Re-enter Consumer Electronics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New standards set by the U.S. government for a
future high-quality television system may give the American
electronics industry a chance to catch up with Japanese and
European makers, but the result could be three separate world TV
broadcast standards, officials and analysts say.
   The United States has lagged behind Europe and Japan in
development of high-definition television _ a new wide-screen TV
system with breathtakingly detailed pictures and high-quality sound
that represents the biggest change in television since color
broadcasting.
   On Sept. 1, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission set
initial standards for future HDTV broadcasts in the United States
that are incompatible with those developed in Europe and Japan.
   This past week in the United States, Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., asked electronics industry trade groups to submit reports
to Congress by January outlining steps the government could take to
ensure American involvement in high-definition TV.
   ``This is the last moment of opportunity for the United States
to remain a major party in the world consumer electronics
industry,'' said John Stern, representative in Japan of the two
largest U.S. electronics trade organizations.
   In Japan, broadcasts using an HDTV system developed by the NHK
public television network are scheduled to begin in two years,
while European companies are expected to launch sales of equipment
for a separate European HDTV system in 1992, officials say. In both
regions, HDTV broadcasts will be beamed direct from satellites to
small receiving dishes in viewers' homes.
   The outcome of the battle among HDTV systems for the world's
living rooms, analysts say, could help determine what country will
dominate the global electronics industry.
   At stake are potential HDTV sales estimated by Japan's NHK at
$80 billion by 1995. But the actual cost could be much greater if
companies _ and countries _ miss out on HDTV production, as most
U.S. electronics makers have with videocassette recorders, compact
disk players and other consumer products.
   ``The U.S. manufacturing industry is worried that HDTV will open
an enormous new market to Japanese companies,'' Stern said. ``It's
not just a matter of television, but also medical and military
imaging, publishing, and computer digital image-processing
equipment. It's all the same technology.''
   The United States is about six years behind Japan in the
commercialization of HDTV technology, Stern says, and the new
preliminary FCC standards will provide it with ``an extra one year,
maximum'' to catch up. Incompatibility with Japanese and European
standards means manufacturers have to design separate equipment for
the U.S. market.
   In Europe, manufacturers were able to develop their HDTV system
in about two years. But unlike those in the United States, European
companies have remained strong in consumer electronics.
   HDTV development began in the 1960s, when engineers at NHK
started developing a state-of-the-art system they hoped would unify
the world's TV systems into a single standard.
   But at international talks on adopting the NHK system as a world
standard in 1986, the Europeans opposed the Japanese HDTV broadcast
standard because of its incompatibility with current television
equipment.
   That lack of compatibility would force consumers and
broadcasters to replace their current equipment _ estimated to be
worth about $100 billion in the United States, according to a
recent Congressional Budget Office report _ if they want to receive
HDTV broadcasts.
   According to the new FCC standards, future HDTV broadcasts in
the United States must use current TV channels and be viewable on
present televisions. However, to see the improved picture quality,
consumers would need to buy new receivers, just as color TV sets
are needed now to see broadcasts in color, while old
black-and-white televisions can receive the same broadcasts in
monochrome.
   NHK officials say they decided to give up compatibility with
current TV equipment because of the technical limitations of
present systems, developed decades ago.
   Since the 1986 meeting, European companies have developed a
separate HDTV system that is viewable _ although with unenhanced
picture quality _ on current European televisions, but not on those
in other parts of the world.
   The new FCC standards are ``a good decision,'' said Maurice
Bourene, attache for science and technology at the European
Community's mission in Japan. ``It's a chance for the United States
to stimulate its own industry.''
   But Bourene said the U.S. decision ``almost definitely'' means
there will be three separate world HDTV broadcast standards.
   ``It's better if we keep our own (European) system because it's
a small protection against the Japanese industry. Even if the
Japanese develop equipment for the European market very quickly,
they will need a license, and it's not clear that they can get it.
So it may be possible (for European makers) to keep hold of the
European market,'' he said.

   Japanese industry officials say they already have perfected
technologies that will meet the FCC standards.
   ``The technology already exists, and Japanese companies should
be able to begin production of equipment without much trouble,''
said Takeo Kumasaka of Japan's Hi-Vision Center, an organization
created in part by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
to encourage development of Japanese HDTV.
   ``Where were they (critics of the Japanese system) while we were
spending more than $50 million to develop equipment for HDTV?''
asked a official at Japan's Sony Corp. ``If they had suggestions,
why didn't they make them earlier?''
   But while debate continues on the details of a final U.S. HDTV
broadcast standard, Japan's NHK system may become a studio and
production standard, at least in some applications.
   Already, film makers in North America and Japan are using the
NHK system to produce movies because of its advantages over film in
speed, ease of editing and adaptibility to special effects.
   Soon, Japanese HDTV videocassette recorders and pre-recorded
tapes are likely to be available, and cable broadcasts may follow.
   ``Studio standards have nothing to do with the FCC, so the FCC
ruling won't affect negotiations on a possible world production
standard for HDTV,'' NHK's Takehiko Motohashi said. ``Therefore,
the FCC ruling won't necessarily affect the exchange (between
countries) of HDTV television programs.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a long-awaited move,
filed extensive civil insider-trading, fraud and stock manipulation
charges against the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
Michael Milken, the head of its junk bond trading unit, and others.
All defendants denied the charges, which stemmed from an
investigation tied to convicted stock speculator Ivan Boesky.
   In a similar case, Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., a former Morgan
Stanley & Co. rookie analyst, pleaded guilty to the first criminal
charges stemming from what the government has called the second
largest insider trading case in Wall Street history. And William
Dillon, a fired Merrill Lynch & Co. stockbroker, pleaded guilty to
fraud after admitting he traded securities based on advance
knowledge of stock-touting columns in Business Week magazine.
   _The Senate approved new limits on imports of textiles, clothing
and shoes, defying the threat of a veto just weeks before November
elections.
   _The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index for finished
goods rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent last month, the
heftiest increase since an identical rise in March.
   _The government reported that the nation's commercial banks
earned $10.5 billion in the first and second quarters of this year,
their most profitable six months on record.
   _Automakers said car and truck sales fell 10.7 percent in
August, compared with the same period a year ago when incentives
prompted quicker buying decisions by consumers.
   _A Commerce Department report found that U.S. businesses plan to
spend a record $429.4 billion this year for plant and equipment
spending.
   _The Federal Reserve Board said Americans took out $2.6 billion
more in consumer credit than they paid off in July, marking a sharp
slowdown from the pace of growth during the first half of the year.
   _A report by the International Monetary Fund predicted
inflation-adjusted growth of 3.8 percent for major industrialized
nations in 1988.
   _The Agriculture Department said the Soviet Union bought an
additional 802,400 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery during the
1988-89 marketing year which began on Sept. 1.
   _Shamrock Holdings Inc. launched a hostile bid for Polaroid
Corp., upping its offer to $42 a share, or a total of $2.4 billion
for the Polaroid shares it does not already own.
   _A federal judge issued a restraining order temporarily blocking
the $2.5 billion merger of Lucky supermarkets into American Stores,
saying the combination threatens serious irreversible harm to
Californians.
   _Britain's Carlton Communications PLC agreed to buy Technicolor
Inc., the film duplicating company whose trademark appears on many
top movies, for $780 million.
   _Campeau Corp. agreed to sell all 76 of its Gold Circle and
Richway stores for more than $325 million.
   _Trans World Airlines Inc. shareholders overwhelmingly approved
Chairman Carl C. Icahn's proposal to buy their shares and take the
nation's seventh largest airline private.
   _The latest Transportation Department figures found that about
four of every five flights by major U.S. airlines arrived on time
in July.
   _Box-office results showed that this year's summer movies

<HEAD>Bond Rally Helps Municipal Market Pick Up Steam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a sleepy August that saw record low sales
volume, the municipal bond market has picked up steam.
   Trading in bonds issued by state and local governments normally
revives with the coming of autumn after the summer doldrums. But
the ``muni'' market also is getting a lift from the recent robust
rally in bond prices in general, touched off Sept. 2 by government
economic reports signaling a slowdown in the economy and suggesting
an easing of inflation.
   The bond rally has again lured to municipals many investors who
were soured on the stock market by last October's crash.
   As bond prices have risen, they have pushed interest rates
lower. The yield on highly-rated municipal issues is now averaging
around 7.98 percent, down from 8.10 percent on Sept. 1, the day
before the economic reports were released.
   If municipal yields keep falling, to a target level of around
7.40 percent to 7.50 percent, a flood of new issues could be
brought to market, some analysts believe.
   ``It's a return to more traditional pulses,'' said William Fish,
a senior vice president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corp.
   The pickup in activity is a welcome relief to market players
after the dog days of August, when sales of long-term municipal
bonds nationwide dropped to around $5.51 billion _ the lowest
monthly total in 2{ years. Muni sales hadn't been that skimpy since
February 1986, when only $3.18 billion of the bonds changed hands.
   Sales normally run around $8 billion a month.
   The September revival is reflected in the volume of new munis
scheduled to hit the market. This coming week, for example, several
big issues are planned: from Illinois ($175 million), Ohio ($155
million), Washington State ($50 million), the New York State
Mortgage Agency ($450 million), Montgomery County, Md., ($50
million) and the Metropolitan Seattle Sewer District ($48 million).
   But in addition to scheduled issues, there's a ``shadow
calendar'' of new munis that's also expected to swell this month.
In those instances, the state or local entity issuing the bonds
waits for interest rates to fall or to see how other muni issues
are received by the market.
   If conditions are right, the issuers emerge from the shadows.
``We then tend to have a mini-rush to market,'' said Neal
Attermann, vice president and municipal research director of Kidder
Peabody & Co.
   Especially sensitive to interest-rate declines are negotiated
municipal issues, in which the issuer and an underwriter negotiate
with each other and reach agreement on the terms of the issue. They
are more hidden from the market than competitive issues, where the
issuer accepts bids from several underwriters seeking to finance
the issue.
   Because negotiated issues are more confidential, their sponsors
can easily keep them hidden on the ``shadow calendar'' until they
feel the time is right. Around 60 percent to 70 percent of all
municipal issues are negotiated, according to analysts.
   This month, ``negotiated issues could come out of the
woodwork,'' said Fish of Donaldson, Lufkin.

<HEAD>Trade Report Will Have Wall Street Seeing Double</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Wall Street has its monthly confrontation
with the government's trade statistics next Wednesday, a new wild
card will be added to the game.
   The Commerce Department is adopting a new format for reporting
the figures, and analysts say it may create more than the usual
confusion in the financial markets.
   Along with a number comparable to those of past months, the
department will calculate the nation's trade deficit excluding the
cost of freight and insurance for imports.
   This so-called Customs value method of figuring the balance
between imports and exports typically produces a deficit total
about $1.5 billion lower than otherwise, analysts note.
   Previously, the Customs value trade balance had been reported at
least two days later than the original, unadjusted figure, and
commanded almost no attention from stock and bond investors.
   Now, says Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber, ``it is likely
that administration spokespersons will be emphasizing the lower
Customs value deficit.''
   As Charles Taylor at Prudential-Bache Securities asserted, ``the
July merchandise trade deficit will be about $1.5 billion lower
than it otherwise would be.
   ``But this is a cosmetic improvement only. The current-account
deficit, and therefore the dollar-financing requirement of the
United States, will not be affected one iota.''
   Some say that kind of assessment is too harsh. After all, they
say, the subject of the data is the ``merchandise'' trade deficit,
and insurance and freight are not merchandise, but services instead.
   Commerce Department officials have said that the change in
procedure, which was mandated by the trade bill enacted in August,
is intended to put proper emphasis on those numbers that most
accurately depict the situation.
   Still, Wall Street analysts say, it may well introduce a new
element of uncertainty to markets that are highly sensitive to
economic statistics like the trade data.
   ``Two different numbers on the same day will initially generate
some temporary confusion and possible cynicism about government
tampering with statistics before elections,'' said Harris.
   Amid the uncertainty pervading Wall Street, the stock market was
able to scratch out some modest gains in the past week, though they
did not live up to hopes built up in a rally begun just before the
Labor Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 14.22 points to
2,068.81.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index chimed in with a
1.18 advance to 150.84; the American Stock Exchange market value
index rose 1.83 to 297.45; and the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market added 5.09 to 381.60.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 135.17 million shares a day,
against 128.48 million the week before.
   When the trade figures are sorted out, what are they likely to
show? Nothing worthy of any big fuss, a cynical observer might say,
since like most monthly data they provide no reliable evidence of
the kind of trend that would concern any savvy, long-term investor.
   That complaint aside, the data are not expected to provide much
news to revive traders' flagging spirits.
   Says the Merrill Lynch Market Letter in its preview of the
report, ``after improving on a fairly steady basis earlier in the
year, the foreign trade deficit had a relapse in June, climbing to
$12.5 billion from $9.8 billion in May. The deficit probably won't
improve much in coming months.''
   The comparable figure for July will probably come in around
$10.5 billion, Merrill Lynch analysts say.

<HEAD>SEC Move on Drexel Goes Beyond Wall Street</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After Black Monday, the last thing Wall Street
needs is another crisis of confidence.
   But the government's massive fraud accusations against
investment giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. threaten to rock the
public's already shaky trust in the fairness of the stock market.
   By refocusing the 2-year-old insider trading investigation on a
major securities firm, the charges leveled by the Securities and
Exchange Commission elevated the scandal well beyond the simple
greed of individuals like Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine.
   In so doing, the government heightened public doubts about the
venerable institutions that control the securities business and
shape the market's role in the American economy.
   Although many investment professionals think the move against
Drexel by the SEC reflects an aggressive government effort to make
the markets fairer, others say that at least for now, the charges
are likely to further erode ordinary Americans' confidence in
stocks and other securities.
   That could mean less business for brokers, less long-term
investing, more difficulty for companies trying to raise money to
grow, rising unemployment, mounting debt and a fall in America's
economic might, some strategists argue.
   ``There's no question this comes at a bad time,'' said Perrin
Long, a securities industry expert at Lipper Analytical Securities
Corp. in New York. ``It probably lowers confidence as far as the
average investor is concerned, below what their already-low
confidence may be.''
   Although Long and others said they believe the securities
industry in general and Drexel in particular will ultimately
survive, ``the sad thing is, if Wall Street doesn't prosper, it's
highly unlikely the country will prosper ... There's a close tie-in
all the way around, and it benefits both not to have our image
tarnished. It's a sad situation.''
   The staggering civil suit filed by the SEC last Wednesday
against Drexel and key employees _ notably its high-yield,
high-risk ``junk bond'' unit chief Michael Milken _ accused them of
a vast array of frauds ranging from insider trading to stock
manipulation to client-cheating.
   The defendants denied the charges, vowed to vigorously fight
them in court and predicted vindication.
   As outlined by the SEC, Drexel engaged in systematic, arrogant
abuse of its position as a leading investment firm, calling into
question why it is in business in the first place.
   ``I would say this particular news story or incident isn't
helpful in terms of bringing the small investor back,'' said
William Gross, managing director of Pacific Investment Management
Co. of Newport Beach, Calif., which manages a $17 billion portfolio
for large institutional clients such as pension funds.
   ``The more headlines you see on trials about insider trading _
I'm not commenting on the veracity of this suit _ the more the
individual investor subscribes to the theory that you can't win,''
Gross said.
   The SEC action had been expected for months and both the stock
and bond markets showed little outward reaction. But it raised the
likelihood that the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office will soon
bring criminal charges, which would be far more serious and could
possibly cripple Drexel's ability to do business.
   The firm's difficult position also recalls the demise of E.F.
Hutton Group Inc., the once-mighty retail brokerage devastated by
fraud charges that arose from a check-kiting scandal three years
ago. A debilitated Hutton was sold to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
last year.
   This analogy hasn't been lost on Drexel, which has undertaken an
unprecedented television campaign for support, stressing what it
calls the firm's role in raising money for projects ranging from
day-care centers to middle-income housing.
   But the SEC move and possible criminal charges may nullify the
effect of that campaign. They also are bound to incite a spree of
suits from investors who claim they lost money on stocks allegedly
manipulated by Drexel and other defendants.
   ``There are two levels of awareness in the marketplace _ you
have the professionals close to the industry who were aware this
was there, and when it happens, it's a non-event,'' said John W.
Bachmann, chairman of the Securities Industry Association. ``Then
there are the people who heard it along the way and weren't aware,
and in that group, it's not a plus.''
   Some say the combined effects of all the litigation and
publicity already have made Drexel a tainted household word, much
in the same way that Boesky, the speculator-felon who led
authorities to the investment firm, became synonymous with Wall
Street insider trading a few years ago.
   John Markese, vice president and research director for the
American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago, said he
believed the Drexel story and other accounts of alleged securities
fraud likely would help drive customers away from retail
stockbrokers and into large mutual funds, which have greater
diversity and strength.
   But ultimately, he said, the federal crackdown on Wall Street
excesses probably would help many investors regain some degree of
assurance that the markets aren't totally rigged, regardless of
whether Drexel exonerates itself.
   ``The small investor is always at the bottom of the information
ladder. That has always been true, and cases like this point up how
tall that ladder is,'' Markese said. ``I think the SEC is trying to
make it a shorter and quicker information flow, so that's all
good.''

   Concern about the worldwide oil glut continues
to weigh heavy on the futures market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude, fell 30 cents a 42-gallon barrel Friday to $14.18. The
contract had risen 32 cents on Thursday after falling sharply
earlier in the week.
   Contracts for refined oil products traded on the exchange also
declined.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery plunged 0.93
cent a gallon to 42.06 cents, after rising 0.40 cent the previous
session. Analysts attributed the decline to the end of the
traditional driving season on Labor Day.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract, which gained 0.24
cent Thursday, fell 0.90 cent to 40.97 a gallon.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said
prices started out firm amid speculation that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries' price monitoring committee might
hold an emergency meeting. But with those prospects unconfirmed,
prices took a nosedive, he said.
   ``The sellers came out of the woodwork ...,'' Beutel said.
   The Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Sharq Bali quoted unnamed
high-level Arab oil sources Friday as saying Venezuela and Algeria
called for a special meeting later this month of the
price-monitoring committee to help stem the decline in oil prices.
   But the newspaper also said a moderate member of the five-member
committee was opposed to the meeting.
   Crude prices on Tuesday and Wednesday hit their lowest point
since Oct. 29, 1986, when they reached $13.73 per barrel. The
following day the price leaped to $15.04 a barrel.

   The government says wholesale prices rose 0.6 percent in August,
but the rise was a slight 0.3 percent excluding food and energy,
and traders took the report as good news on inflation.
   The Labor Department said Friday the August rise, excluding the
volatile food and energy categories, was half the increase of July.
   Another drop in oil prices also helped the inflation picture.
And gold prices plunged and bonds rose, a classic sign that
investors were less concerned about inflation.
   Gold, which investors hold as a hedge against inflation, sank
$7.25 a troy ounce to $421.25 an ounce in late U.S. trading, its
lowest point since early 1987.
   Bond prices, which are hurt by inflation fears, finished higher
after seesawing through a volatile trading session, pushing key
interest rates below 9 percent.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose 9-16 point, or
about $5.60 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate
trends, fell to 8.97 percent from 9.03 percent late Thursday.
   Meanwhile, stock prices took a zigzag path, winding up with a
modest gain in continued sluggish trading. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrials rose 5.69 to 2,068.81.
   Crude oil futures plunged on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid rumors Saudi Arabia had vetoed proposals for a special meeting
of the OPEC pricing committee.
   On other exchanges, contracts for future delivery of precious
metals, grains, soybeans, livestock and meat all finished
moderately to sharply lower while stock-index futures advanced.
