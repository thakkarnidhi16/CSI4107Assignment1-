   In an adventure with almost as many twists and
plot turns as the movie itself, Ayn Rand's ``We the Living'' is
about to make it to American theaters. The 46-year-old film was
thought to have been destroyed by Mussolini.
   ``We The Living'' was made in war-time Italy in 1942, and was
based on the novel of the same name by Ayn Rand, whose
``objectivism'' philosphy in such works as ``The Fountainhead'' and
``Atlas Shrugged'' made her a cult figure in the 1970s.
   The movie has caused a stir over the years, and has repeatedly
won critical acclaim, from the Venice Festival of 1942 to the Fourth
Annual Boston Film Festival last month.
   A surface indictment of communism, the lushly photographed,
romantic saga is set in Russia as the tidal wave of revolution
boiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes in the
way people lived and loved and survived.
   Rossano Brazzi co-stars as a tubercular aristocat who can't get a
job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out of
fashion. He said he made arrangements for Rand to get her first look
at the film when he met her in Hollywood after the war. However, he
didn't think Italy's fascist government had ordered the movie to be
destroyed.
   It went out of circulation because the ``natural life of the film
was over,'' Brazzi said in a telephone interview from his home in
Rome.
   But Massimo Ferrara-Santamaria, a Rome lawyer who was general
manager of the studio where the movie was made, said he was called
before a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives and
copies of the film, and was stripped of his position at the studio
and as lecturer at Italian universities for his role in making the
movie.
   ``In the tragic Italian war situation, the film was called by the
public `Noi Morti' (`We the Dead'),'' he said in an interview,
adding that Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels banned the film
in Germany after Ferrara personally showed it at Goebbels' Berlin
home in October 1942.
   ``At the end of the screening, Goebbels told me that the Russians
were habitually presented to the German public in a much more
negative way than in this picture, and therefore it was no good for
Germany,'' he said.
   Erika and Henry Mark Holzer, the movie's producers, were Rand's
lawyers in the 1960s. Mrs. Holzer said the author believed the
banning story and authorized a search for the film that took the two
attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives. It
finally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with ``a
bunch of Italian films for sale.''
   They rode through the bumpy back streets of Rome with a load of
potentially explosive nitrate-treated film in the back of an old
truck, including the negative for ``We the Living.'' They had the
movie transferred to ``safety film'' before flying it back to New
York.
   Mrs. Holzer believes they found the original nitrate negative,
which Ferrara had hidden.
   Ferrara and others say Italy's Ministry of Culture ordered the
film destroyed about five months after its release on the grounds
that though the message might purport to be anti-communist, it could
also be taken as anti-totalitarian _ a strong statement for
individualism, regardless of political coloration.
   The fascists didn't want that kind of propaganda message playing
on the homefront with Italy's Axis troops stretched from North
Africa to Stalingrad, and the Allies storming the beaches of Sicily.
   Rand had a hard-line, libertarian philosophy. It was best
exemplified by Gary Cooper in the ``Fountainhead,'' who played an
architect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to be
desecrated by the whims of popularism.
   Mrs. Holzer said Rand liked the film version of ``We the Living''
even more than ``The Fountainhead,'' although the author had written
the latter's screenplay herself and was not asked for permission for
the Italian film.
   Brazzi said it was a so-called war movie: ``We'll worry after the
war about paying for it.'' He said Rand eventually did receive
compensation from Scalera, the producing studio.
   Mrs. Holzer said that once she and her husband recovered an
original nitrate negative, Rand went through the film frame by frame
to identify exactly how she wanted it edited. The Italian version
was made in two parts and ran over 4{ hours. The project was set
aside when Rand had other commitments, and was not picked up until
after the author's death in 1982. The film was restored by Duncan
Scott.
   The epic was shot entirely on indoor, elaborately built Italian
war-time sets recreating Russian country scenes, trains, ships and
Petrograd.
   ``I'm told almost the entire White Russian community in Italy was
used as extras,'' Mrs. Holzer said.
   The new version, distributed by Angelika Films, is under three
hours, and is set for release Nov. 5 in Boston, Nov. 11 in Los
Angeles and Nov. 25 in New York. It will play to other major U.S.
markets before January.
   The film also stars a young and radiant Alida Valli, the female
lead in the 1949 British thriller, ``The Third Man''; and Fosco
Giachetti, who was the No. 1 box-office draw in Italy when the movie
was made, according to its producers.
   ``We the Living'' has a bit of soap opera in it: Beautiful Kira
loves Leo, the tubercular aristocat; Andrei of the dreaded secret
police loves Kira because she has the courage to be independent and
defiant of the new order.
   But underneath the suds is a hard reality: Kira forsakes her love
when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line. Andrei kills
himself when he realizes first that Kira used him to get Leo a spot
in a sanitarium, and that his adored party leaves no freedom for
individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel or saint.
   Kira goes forward, wiser but unbowed, a testimony to the strong
and the living, and the survival of the toughest.
   Rand, who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfettered
capitalism and ``rational selfishness,'' held individual freedom as
the highest ideal. She said alturism was weakness, and blamed it for
much of the world's woes. But she also attacked libertarians of the
right who often identified with her philosophy.

<HEAD>Scientists Try To Explain Mysteries Of Chinese Qi Treatment</HEAD>

   A scientist in a white lab coat scraped bits of
cancer tissue from a white mouse into two sterilized glass dishes.
   Two young men in slightly scruffy street clothes sat on stools in
front of the dishes. Each extended his right hand over a dish,
closed his eyes and concentrated.
   ``They are giving off qi,'' whispered the scientist, immunologist
Gu Ligang.
   The experiment, a hybrid of modern scientific method and seeming
magic, is part of a growing effort among Chinese scientists to
verify and analyze what many Chinese believe to be a special human
energy called qi.
   The belief in Qi is central to traditional Chinese medicine but
it is viewed skeptically by Western scientists.
   In this case, the two men giving off qi were attempting to kill
the cancerous cells in the dishes.
   Popular interest in qi and 2,000-year-old exercises to develop
it, called qigong, is sweeping China after the method had been
suppressed for decades as superstition. An estimated 50 million
adults practice qigong exercises, while hospitals, schools and
scholarly institutes across China are researching qi.
   ``Qigong is a national cultural treasure and an integral part of
Chinese traditional medicine's theoretical system and healing
methods,'' Vice Minister of Health Hu Ximing told a recent
conference in Beijing of nearly 600 scientists and qigong masters
from more than a dozen countries.
   Qi, the Chinese word for air and gas, has a special meaning in
medicine _ the breath of life.
   Chinese traditional medicine teaches that qi flows through the
body in invisible channels, like veins, and that illness is a result
of blockages in its flow. Traditional healing techniques, from
herbal medicines to acupuncture to qigong, are efforts to restore
the distribution of qi.
   Gu Ligang's experiment with the cancerous cells, like hundreds
being done nationwide, seeks to gather physical evidence of whether
some people, known as qigong masters, can project their qi like a
beam of energy to manipulate matter and cure illness.
   Gu, one of 30 qigong researchers at the Beijing College of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, said some cancerous cells were killed
in one sample in his experiment, but not enough to prove anything.
   Qigong masters, however, say their work proves the mysterious
force exists.
   Hu Yulan, 59, said she has cured serious heart and neurological
illnesses by directing her qi at patients.
   Another master, Wan Sujian, said a 49-year-old peasant woman came
to him after a surgeon told her a large tumor in her brain was
inoperable and that she would die in two months.
   Wan said the woman could barely walk because of the tumor's
pressure on portions of the brain that control movement.
   But after 10 treatments, he said, the woman was walking freely.
   ``The tumor has shrunk,'' Wan claimed. He predicted complete
recovery.
   Thousands of other qigong masters, who operate clinics without
licensing or regulation, make similar claims. Some say they can heal
bone fractures and diagnose ailments with X-ray vision _ even when
the patient is absent. Volumes of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous
cures have been published.
   ``There are many blank areas in science,'' said Liu Yaning, a
biophysicist at the air force's Xidiaoyutai Hospital in Beijing.
``In China, many scientists believe the qigong masters will lead a
revolution in science.''
   But Western medicine, which in the past decade has found chemical
explanations for acupuncture's ability to deaden pain, balks at the
concept of qi.
   ``I haven't been convinced by any experiment that this energy
exists or that it can be controlled,'' said Dr. David Eisenberg, an
instructor at the Harvard Medical School who attended the qigong
conference.
   However, Eisenberg, who studied traditional medicine in China in
1979 and 1980 and wrote a book about qigong, said he has seen
startling demonstrations of qigong masters' skills and cannot simply
dismiss them as fakes.
   ``There are phenomenon in every culture that suggests there may
be the ability of humans to sense and-or manipulate their own
biological fields, for lack of a better word,'' he said. ``I'm
troubled but not convinced.''
   Chinese scientists also are troubled. Many who are testing qigong
masters said they believe some form of special human energy exists,
but can't define it.
   Books on qigong describe it variously as akin to radar, infrared
light, magnetism, subsonic sound waves or all of those.
   ``I think qi is a big bag,'' Liu said. ``There are a lot of
things in it _ not just one kind of energy or matter.''
   He added that his experiments, showing that natural luminescence
given off by qigong masters' bodies is higher than that given off by
other people, have convinced him qi exists.
   ``There is much clinical evidence to see the effect of qigong on
many different diseases,'' said Dr. Lu Yongcai, a pathologist at the
Beijing College of Traditional Medicine's Qigong Institute. ``We
want to know the mechanisms. That qi is present is no problem.''
   ``Qi definitely can cause biological reactions. That's a fact,''
said Zhou Yang, the institute's chief immunologist.
   He said his experiments have shown that qi can promote the
proliferation of disease-fighting T-cells in laboratory mice and
stimulate the development of the thymus, an important gland in the
immune system.
   Chinese scientists at the qigong conference said their work
showed qigong masters can do such things as kill or inhibit leukemia
cells in mice, promote healing of strained muscles and broken bones
in rabbits and sharpen intelligence.
   Eisenberg contended that most of the studies suffered from poor
design or lacked control groups and other standard precautions
against bias.
   ``There is at least as much likelihood that this is a cultural,
societal wish fulfillment,'' he said. ``Qi is part of the culture.
... They are wed to it, they want to prove it.''
   But Dr. Gabriel Stux, who runs an acupuncture clinic in
Duesseldorf in West Germany, noted that Western medicine also relies
on techniques not fully understood.
   ``Many drugs, you don't know how they work. But you do a lot of
pragmatic things,'' he said.

   Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress who is
posting $5 million bail for former Philippine first lady Imelda
Marcos, inherited so much money from her father she was once known
as ``the richest girl in the world.''
   ``If you're going to live, you have to be a part of life,'' Miss
Duke, now 75, told The Associated Press in a 1944 interview.
   ``She leads a fruitful and enjoyable life,'' said her attorney,
Donald Robinson. But she refuses interviews and maintains her
privacy even when she ventures outside her walled 2,700-acre estate
here in rolling hills about 45 miles west of New York.
   The 6-foot-tall Miss Duke, whose wealth is estimated by Forbes
magazine at $800 million and by her former business manager at $2.5
billion, has become largely a recluse, though friendships are
important to her.
   ``It was Miss Duke's idea to help (Mrs. Marcos),'' Robinson said
after a bail hearing in federal court Wednesday. Mrs. Marcos, who is
charged along with her husband, former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos, with racketeering, made the trip to New York from
the couple's home in Hawaii last weekend aboard Miss Duke's lavishly
appointed private jet.
   Robinson said Miss Duke and Mrs. Marcos are old friends.
   ``She's embarrassed at the mistreatment of the Marcos family by
the United States who invited them to come into the States several
years ago, and then at least one prosecutor turns around and calls
them criminals,'' Robinson said in a telephone interview Wednesday
afternoon.
   Miss Duke ``doesn't believe that should be part of the American
justice system. All I can tell you is they're dear, dear friends,''
he said.
   Robinson said Mrs. Marcos and Miss Duke met through mutual
friends in Manhattan, but he declined to be more specific.
   Miss Duke first drew widespread publicity in 1926, when she was
14. Following the death of her father, tobacco and electric power
magnate James Buchanan Duke, the teen-ager sued her mother and other
trustees of the estate for title to the family's assetts here and in
Manhattan.
   By the time the estate was settled in 1934, most of it going to
Miss Duke, the holdings were worth about $133 million, what one
newspaper account at the time said was more than one-third of the
entire national income at the height of the Great Depression.
   Society pages called her ``the richest girl in the world'' as
they reported her attendance at events such as opera openings.
   In 1944, Miss Duke very publicly completed training as a
$1-a-year worker for United Seamen's Service, helping America's
merchant seamen deal with wounds and the trials of war.
   She also endured two thoroughly chronicled divorces, the death of
a day-old premature daughter and the accidental killing of a
long-time companion who was crushed to death by a car Miss Duke was
driving. She retreated to her extensive land holdings in New Jersey,
Newport, R.I., Honolulu, Manhattan and Charlotte, N.C.
   She goes to great lengths to avoid the news media. During a land
dispute with New Jersey in 1987, Miss Duke would only answer written
questions from reporters through her attorney.
   Robinson said Miss Duke remains at her Hillsborough estate,
staying active in the background in fights for animal rights and
preserving farmland.
   A book published last year by her former business manager,
Patrick Mahn, said her father nurtured that activism.
   ``J.B. fostered her love of animals and nature and he told her
that every animal had a soul,'' Mahn wrote in an unauthorized
biography co-written by Tom Valentine, a former friend of Miss Duke.
   Her father amassed his fortune by building the American Tobacco
Co. from a small tobacco crop overtaken by Yankee forces during the
Civil War, and from Duke Power Co. His contributions to small
Trinity College in North Carolina caused it to be renamed Duke
University in 1924.

<TEXT>
   A former chef who dines at expensive
restaurants and then pleads poverty has been convicted for the 54th
time of refusing to pay for a meal.
   Paul Charles Dozsa, 48, dubbed ``the restaurant runner'' by local
newspapers, was fined $160 on Monday for refusing to pay a $50 bill
at a Chinese restaurant.
   The following day, he dined out at the five-star
Sheraton-Wentworth hotel, then told the staff he could not pay the
$48 check. He was fined $200 for that offense on Wednesday and
ordered to compensate the restaurant.
   Dozsa pleaded guilty to the charges, saying he was ``in a state
of inebriation''.
   Police said Dozsa gave his address as a coffee shop, whose staff
told reporters they knew Dozsa but always checked if he had money
before serving him as he had frequently refused to pay.

   A barge loaded with thousands of gallons
of diesel fuel and gasoline burned out of control Wednesday after an
explosion left three of its four crewmen missing, authorities said.
   State police said one crewman, identified as Stephen Hobbs of
Anchorage, apparently waded ashore after an explosion rocked the
vessel Wednesday morning and was treated for shock.
   The three men listed as missing were Stan Hanson, the skipper, of
Anchor Point; Bruce Babcock, the engineer, of Homer; and Carl
Anderson of Anchorage, driver of a fuel truck aboard the vessel,
troopers said.
   The cause of the blaze was not known. The fire started at 8:45
a.m. near Trading Bay, 70 miles south of Anchorage. The vessel was
about 100 yards off shore.
   Coast Guard Lt. Matt Carr said interviews with boat's owners
revealed that 20,000 gallons of gasoline were under the deck,
``which has made us reevaluate the firefighting effort.''
   He said the vessel would be allowed to burn, and the fire would
be monitored from a safe distance. Carr described the fire as
``subsiding'' Wednesday night, about nine hours after the blaze
began.
   At 5 p.m., the barge was still burning, and the Coast Guard
ordered its cutter to observe the fire from a safe distance and not
to attempt to fight the blaze.
   The 197-ton vessel, called the Alaska Constructor and owned by
Motor Vessel Construction Co. of Homer, was carrying a 36,000
gallons of diesel fuel and a tank truck containing 3,000 gallons of
fuel, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Haley.
   Haley said fuel entered the sea and burned there, but the amount
of the leakage was unknown. He said small boats from nearby oil
platforms helped in fighting the fire.

   An anonymous buyer set an auction
record for an Australian painting when he paid $1.05 million for a
work Rupert Bunny painted in France around 1910.
   The painting, Une Nuit De Canicule (Hot Summer Night), is
regarded as Bunny's greatest work.
   Bidding by phone, the buyer refused to be identified. The
auctioneers said the buyer was Australian.
   Auctioneer Leonard Joel's art director John Dwyer said the record
sale was a ``justifiable price for a world class painting'' and
would ``stay in the country _ probably in a private collection.''
   Bunny, an Australian artist who established his early reputation
in Europe, died in 1947.
   The previous auction record for an Australian painting was the
$700,000 paid for Arthur Streeton's Settlers Camp in 1985 by
businessman Robert Holmes a Court.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of a felony for munching on
grapes at a grocery store was ordered to pay 40 cents in restitution
and $600 in court costs.
   Eli Bradley Jr., 52, could have been imprisoned for up to four
years on the charge of larceny from a building. But Jackson County
Circuit Judge Russell E. Noble on Wednesday delayed the sentence and
said he would consider removing the conviction from Bradley's record
if he stayed out of trouble until Oct. 4, 1989.
   ``I'm going to appeal this because I'm not guilty of no felony,''
Bradley said after the hearing. ``Any felony on your record works
against you for the rest of your life. If they can do what they did
in this court, nobody is safe in the courts.''
   Bradley was arrested March 4 while leaving a grocery store.
Security guards testified during his trial that they saw Bradley
eating several handfuls of grapes while shopping.
   Bradley testified that he ate no more than two or three grapes to
be sure they were seedless before buying more than 1{ pounds of
grapes along with other groceries for $13.25.
   Prosecutor Joseph Filip offered in June to reduce the charge to
misdemeanor shoplifting. Defense lawyer Richard L. Wilkins chose to
go to trial on the felony charge, which he considered easier to
defend. A jury convicted Bradley in September.
   ``This matter, in my opinion, could have been handled with much
less expense as a misdemeanor, not a felony,'' the judge said
Wednesday.
   Assistant prosecutor Donald Ray said his office probably would
oppose removal of the felony conviction next year even if Bradley
stayed out of trouble.
   Filip said the September verdict showed the community agrees that
``we don't want people stealing from stores.''
   In the Republican prosecutor's re-election campaign, his
Democratic challenger, Paul R. Adams, has chided him as having
``made the county safe for grapes.''

<HEAD>John Schlesinger Looks for Irony</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the title character in his latest film,
``Madame Sousatzka,'' John Schlesinger doesn't see himself as a
teacher. The director would rather have audiences make up their own
minds.
   ``I hope there's plenty of irony in all my films. That's the very
thing I look for,'' said the British director of ``Midnight
Cowboy,'' ``Marathon Man'' and other acclaimed movies.
   ``It could all be disaster, but it isn't. That's kind of my
attitude to life. Most of the endings I've had, there is a question
mark. They're often about people determined to carry on.''
   ``Madame Sousatzka,'' based on the novel by Bernice Rubens, takes
place in London and stars Shirley MacLaine as a demanding, emotional
piano teacher whose philosophy, ``I teach how to live,'' is the
cause of much conflict with her students.
   Schlesinger originally sought a European actress to play the
Russian-born teacher, but wanted MacLaine after deciding to cast an
American.
   ``I liked the fact that she was willing to take risks,'' he said.
``I thought she brought quite a lot to `Terms of Endearment,'
looking dreadful. She's not worried about her Shirley MacLaine
image. I got to know that very fast.''
   Schlesinger credits MacLaine, whose work in ``Terms of
Endearment'' earned her an Academy Award for best actress in 1985,
with making the eccentric Sousatzka believeable.
   ``Sometimes when I worked on the script, I'd say, `Oh god, she's
too monstrous.' But she had a way of playing the eccentricities so
that it was totally part of her,'' the director said. ``She doesn't
play to the audience at all. I think it's a most extraordinary
performance.''
   For the part of Manek Sen, the 15-year-old prodigy who endures
Sousatzska's violent mood swings, Schlesinger auditioned hundreds of
actors before choosing newcomer Navin Chowdhry, who makes his film
debut in the movie. Chowdhry had no musical training, but
Schlesinger nevertheless found him perfect for the part. The
youngster worked with musical advisor Yonty Solomon.
   In a way, Irina Sousatzka can be likened to Nora Desmond, the
aging actress in ``Sunset Boulevard.'' Both are flamboyant on the
surface and lonely underneath. Desmond falls in love with a young
screenwriter, Sousatskza with Manek.
   ``It's a love story. She's created something and now she falls in
love with him,'' Schlesinger noted.
   ``She's a survivor. Even if she's angry or upset. I believe it
isn't so removed from people even if the subject is about music.
It's all about perfectly common human experience.''
   The 62-year-old Schlesinger's own musical background attracted
him to the story. His father was a cellist, his mother a violinist,
and Schlesinger himself was an accomplished pianist as a child.
   Schlesinger was a character actor in the 1950s, appearing on
stage, in television and films. He also made documentary shorts. His
first commercial film, ``Terminus,'' won the Golden Lion for best
documentary at the 1961 Venice Film Festival.
   ``A Kind of Loving,'' his first feature film, was released the
following year. Starring a then unknown Alan Bates, the film won the
Golden Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival and established
Schlesinger as one of England's most talented young directors.
   He then directed ``Billy Liar'' and ``Darling,'' which earned
Julie Christie the best actress Oscar in 1965. ``Midnight Cowboy,''
his first film made in Hollywood, earned Academy Awards for best
picture, director and best adapted screenplay in 1969.
   With Jon Voight as a Texan hustler and Dustin Hoffman as a
tubercular Bronx con man, ``Midnight Cowboy'' typified Schlesinger's
fascination with characters who are ``up against it.''
   Schlesinger sees that theme running strongly in ``Madame
Sousatzka.''
   ``In the case of Manek, he's up against the promise of success
and the possibility of failure which she has been up against,'' he
said. ``She's up against her past. She's up against it in many ways.
It makes her behave a certain way.
   ``They're all up against something. Changing London, changing
values.''
   Schlesinger has also directed Glenda Jackson in ``Sunday, Bloody
Sunday'' and Hoffman and Sir Laurence Olivier in ``Marathon Man.''
   ``Enthusiasm,'' the director says, is what he looks for from his
actors. MacLaine, he said, loved the role. ``She ... didn't care
about the money, was charming to everyone, particularly the boy. The
fact that's she's out banging the drum about the movie proves she's
enthusiastic.''
   And so is Schlesinger. He's merged his great loves, film and
music, and feels the movie expresses certain things he feels.
   ``It's communicating,'' he said. ``You're trying to invoke an
emotional response to something, to make them laugh or make them
angry as well as just telling a story.''

<HEAD>Economic Crisis In Peru Raises Danger Of Military Takeover</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alan Garcia, Peru's youthful president, was
viewed as Latin America's brightest political star after taking
office three years ago, but today his nation is mired in its worst
economic crisis of the century.
   Garcia's reputation is in tatters, and the country's fragile
democracy appears increasingly vulnerable to a military coup.
   Since Garcia imposed the harshest austerity program in Peru's
history in early September, some critics have gone so far as to
demand his resignation, and he reportedly has considered stepping
down. More ominously, many public figures are warning of the growing
danger of a military takeover.
   Cesar Hilderbrandt, editor of the independent news magazine Si,
wrote in a recently published open letter to Garcia: ``You know,
just as other officials of your government do, that a coup d'etat is
inevitable if the political and economic climate of today continues
to devastate the country,''
   Peru's armed forces seized power in 1968 and ruled until 1980.
They returned to the barracks under heavy public accusations that
their leftist policies brought on economic mismanagement.
   The 39-year-old Garcia's approval rating among Peru's 21 million
people has plunged from an incredible 96 percent during his first
months in office to 16 percent in late October, according to the
respected polling firm Apoyo.
   When he took over, the 6-foot-3 Garcia, leader of the populist
Aprista Party, was called ``the president of hope'' by his
followers, most of them impoverished mountain peasants or
inhabitants of Lima's sprawling shantytowns.
   Nowadays he is accused of being a demagogue, of implementing
impetuous, irresponsible policies that have brought economic ruin to
the nation, and of failing to curtail the Shining Path movement,
whose eight-year guerrilla war has claimed more than 12,000 lives.
   Mario Vargas Llosa, the renowned novelist who is expected to be
the presidential candidate of a center-right coalition in the 1990
election, recently described Garcia as ``the charismatic young man
responsible for Peru's most incompetent and ruinous government of
the century.''
   What has Peruvians most upset is the country's unprecedented
runaway inflation, provoked, economists agree, by the government's
uncontrolled spending, which has spawned a huge fiscal deficit
equivalent to 16 percent of the gross domestic product.
   Consumer prices soared by 114 percent in September, as much in
one month as all of last year. Inflation is expected to exceed 1,000
percent by year end.
   Having eaten up the country's hard currency reserves to finance a
consumer-hinged economic recovery program and having cut itself off
from fresh foreign loans, the government is close to bankruptcy. It
has had to resort to selling the Central Bank's gold bullion to pay
import bills, but now that is gone.
   Finance Minister Abel Salinas said recently the economy would
shrink by at least 6 percent this year after growing 8.5 percent in
1986 and 7.0 percent in 1987.
   The harsh austerity measures, which included increases in food
prices of more than 200 percent and a devaluation of nearly 90
percent, brought economic activity to a halt.
   Only four new cars were sold in the country in September because
of tax increases that doubled car prices, with the least expensive
Volkswagen model now costing $26,000. Beer sales were down 90
percent from August.
   From early September until mid October, Garcia did not leave the
inner confines of the Government Palace for 34 straight days, except
on one occasion to watch the changing of the guards from the front
entrance. That single, fleeting appearance was interpreted by
commentators as a gesture to dispel rumors he was no longer in
charge of the government.
   Garcia was reported to have tried to present his resignation to
his Cabinet before the unpopular austerity package was imposed and
to have offered the job to Luis Alberto Sanchez, his 88-year-old,
blind vice president. Sanchez said later that he told Garcia, ``I
was elected vice president to collaborate with you, not to take your
place.''
   Political analysts say Garcia's recent behavior has given the
impression of a dangerous power vacuum that feeds the fears of a
military takeover.
   ``Even the least informed citizen knows, or senses, that there
cannot be a power vacuum in politics. He also knows that in Peru
power vacuums are always filled by the military,'' Manuel
d'Ornellas, editor of the opposition newspaper Expreso, wrote in a
recent column.
   A senior government official told The Associated Press that the
military high command did, in fact, meet to consider overthrowing
Garcia during his self-imposed confinement to the palace.
   ``The president was passing through a period of depression that
worried the military,'' the official said, speaking on condition he
not be identified.
   Having suffered in the past under long spells of military rule,
Peru's political leaders have been outspoken in demanding that the
armed forces not be provoked into seizing power again.
   ``Nothing would be more tragic for Peru than a military coup,''
writer Vargas Llosa said. ``Peru's isolation from the international
community would be aggravated even further.''

<HEAD>Cities Set Up `Grow Your Own' Teacher Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban school districts faced with tight budgets
and serious teacher shortages are devising innovative local
solutions such as ``grow your own'' programs to create more
educators, a private study shows.
   The Council of the Great City Schools, in a report released
Tuesday, said big cities are especially short of minority teachers
and instructors in specialized areas. For the 45 districts included
in the study, 70 percent of students were minorities, compared with
32 percent of the teaching force.
   ``The sad truth is that most new teachers would rather teach
anywhere other than a large city,'' the study said. ``Black teacher
education students possess no more inclination to teach in large
cities than white candidates.''
   The study, ``Teaching and Leading in the Great City Schools,''
said teacher shortages are four times higher in urban areas than
elsewhere in the country and could quadruple by 1992 in the biggest
cities.
   Yet the council, a coalition of 45 of the largest urban school
districts in the country, chose to highlight how cities are meeting
the challenge rather than dwelling on the problems they face.
   ``We want to make clear that although the needs of urban areas
are critical, the situation is not without hope,'' said the report.
``We are moving ahead, with or without the additional funding,
because we cannot afford to wait.''
   The study said major increases in financing are needed to meet
the challenges confronting urban schools, but that ``these obstacles
are not stopping urban districts from experimenting with many
approaches, using the funds available to them.''
   Council Executive Director Sam Husk said of the report: ``One of
the most exciting (approaches) seems to be the `grow your own'
philosophy.''
   While Philadelphia offers non-professional school district
employees a teacher's salary while they train for teacher
certification, San Diego reaches out to its large supply of local
military retirees and offers special certification programs for
retired Navy personnel who have bachelor's degrees in math or
science.
   New York City, in need of bilingual teachers, sends recruiters on
regular visits to Spain and the Dominican Republic and has
established two permanent recruitment offices in Puerto Rico.
   Under the minority intern program in Omaha, Neb., students at the
University of Nebraska receive a stipend to spend 15 to 20 hours a
week in elementary and secondary classrooms tutoring youngsters and
shadowing teachers and administrators.
   Houston has a magnet high school which prepares college-bound
students from various ethnic backgrounds for a teaching career.
   In California, Fresno's ``special friends'' program teams high
school students who are interested in teaching with elementary
school children who need special attention. In Rochester, N.Y., the
school district offers a 12-step salary scale to bring teachers' pay
in line with other professions.
   The urban schools also reported new programs to hold on to
existing teachers by improving morale and working conditions, to
increase the skills of teachers and administrators, and to enhance
cooperation between the teachers and other school officials.

<HEAD>Governors To Meet With Feds To Discuss Nuclear Waste Disposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top Energy Department officials will meet with
the governors of Colorado, Idaho and New Mexico this month to
discuss ways of disposing of radioactive wastes from weapons
facilities.
   Waste disposal is one of many problems that have beset the
department's nuclear weapons complex, forcing four facilities to
partially close and virtually halting the production of atomic arms.
   Idaho governor Cecil Andrus took credit Tuesday for forcing the
issue by blocking his state's borders last month to a rail car
loaded with radioactive wastes.
   Andrus said Tuesday that because he ``turned up the heat,'' his
state was no longer being asked to shoulder the burden and that he
would ask federal officials ``for concrete evidence they are moving
forward'' on ways to solve the disposal problem.
   ``Now we are getting support from sources that might have been
content to sit back in the past and let Idaho take the heat,''
Andrus told reporters in Boise.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington asked the three governors to
meet in Salt Lake City on Nov. 16 with a team headed by his chief
deputy, Joseph Salgado, to discuss how to dispose of defense wastes
until the department can open its planned Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant near Carlsbad, N.M.
   Andrus and Govs. Roy Romer of Colorado and Garrey Carruthers of
New Mexico said they would attend but that the date might shift.
   ``It's important to New Mexico to get this thing resolved,''
Carruthers said through spokesman Don Caviness.
   Romer said through his press secretary Cindy Parmenter that he
would take part, but described the Nov. 16 date as tentative.
   The situation became critical last month when Andrus turned away
a steel-lined boxcar loaded with low-level radioactive waste. He
declared the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory off-limits for
further waste storage and said that if Energy Department officials
``can't handle the waste, they shouldn't be generating it.''
   The rail car, loaded with 140 drums each containing 55 gallons of
waste, ended up at a siding at the department's Rocky Flats Plant
near Denver.
   The Colorado governor allowed the boxcar to park at Rocky Flats,
but asked department officials not to unload it and turned down
their request to expand waste storage facilities there.
   The government had planned to open the New Mexico facility last
month, but was delayed because Congress failed to pass legislation
to transfer the land from the Bureau of Land Management to the
Energy Department.
   Low-level radioactive material would be buried 2,000 feet
underground in salt deposits at the New Mexico site.
   Rocky Flats, the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, and
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., have been
shipping radioactive rags, machines parts, gloves, liquids and other
debris to the Idaho site, where an estimated 2 million cubic feet of
the waste is stored below ground and 2.4 million cubic feet is
stored above ground in steel barrels.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. savings bonds will earn interest at a rate
of 7.35 percent over the next six months, the government has
announced.
   The new rate, which took effect Tuesday, is up from a rate of
6.90 percent that was effective from May 1 to Nov. 1.
   Jerrold B. Speers, executive director of the savings bond
program, called the new rate ``highly competitive with other savings
and investment instruments'' and said it should help boost bond
sales in coming months.
   The new rate is the highest since savings bonds earned 8.36
percent from November 1985 through May 1986.
   Interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year on May 1 and
Nov. 1, to reflect open market interest rates. The rate is based on
85 percent of the yield on five-year Treasury securities, which have
averaged 8.65 percent over the past six months.
   The total value of bonds held by the public now exceeds $107
billion.

<HEAD>Surpassing U.S., Nigeria Will Be Fourth Most Populous Nation By

   Nigeria's surging birth rate will triple
its population by 2025, making it the world's fourth most populous
country after China, India and the Soviet Union, a new U.N. study
predicts.
   The ``U.N. World Population Chart _ 1988'' predicts that 25 years
into the third millennium Nigeria will have 301.3 million people,
surpassing the United States' 300.7 million.
   The west-central African nation was the world's 10th most
populous in 1985, with 95.1 million people.
   Undersecretary-general Rafeeuddin Ahmad, introducing the study at
a news conference Tuesday, said Africa's population is growing
faster than that of any other continent:
   ``The populations of Asia and Latin America are growing more
moderately than Africa's, and of course in many countries in Europe,
the population growth is almost stationary.
   ``Each woman in the world has, on the average, 3.4 children. That
is the total fertility rate. The number for Africa is 6.2, and it is
around 3.5 in Latin America and Asia,'' he said.
   Kenya and Rwanda have fertility rates of more than eight children
per woman, according to the chart.
   ``In contrast, women in Europe and North America have 1.7 to 1.8
children, a number not sufficient to replace the existing population
in the long run,'' Ahmad said.
   He said Africa's high birth rate offsets a life expectancy of
only 52 years, compared with an average of 60 for developing
countries as a whole and 73 for industrialized nations.
   ``Aging is bound to become a very important issue in governments
both in the developed and developing countries in coming years,''
said Ahmad.
   By the year 2025, China will have an estimated 1.49 billion
people, and India 1.44 billion. The Soviet Union is expected to have
351.4 million.
   The 6th through 10th most populous nations in 2025 are expected
to be Pakistan, with 267 million; Indonesia, 257.7 million; Brazil,
245.8 million; Bangladesh, 234. 9 million; and Mexico, with 150
million people.
   Currently, West Germany, Italy, Britain, France, and Spain rank
in the 25 most populous countries. By 2025, France is expected to be
the only West European nation in the top 25, holding the 24th rank
with 60.4 million people.
   The world's population was 5.1 billion in mid-1988 and will reach
6 billion in 1998. By 2025, it is expected to hit 8.46 billion.
   Population has been growing at a rate of about 1.7 percent since
the mid-1970s, a rate that will remain steady until the mid-1990s,
then steadily decline to below 1 percent by 2025, said Ahmad.
   The Population Division of the U.N. Department of International
Economic and Social Affairs prepared the data for the chart.

weeks for treatment of a severe respiratory infection, the
government said.
   Haughey, 63, was admitted to the Mater hospital Oct. 14.
   Discharged Tuesday, he was not expected to resume full duties
until later this month, said a government spokesman who declined to
be named.
   Earlier this year, Haughey was hospitalized for kidney stones, a
problem that recurred while he was undergoing treatment for
respiratory infection.
   Haughey heads the Fianna Fail party and was elected to his third

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Dukakis' Conversion Risky Nine Days Before
Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis & Co. should have seen it
coming.
   A campaign with a clear game plan could have dealt in advance
with the troublesome liberal label it first shunned and now has
claimed as its own. It might have defined the label in its own way
instead of leaving the Republicans leeway to write the campaign
definition.
   Political labeling often has become a problem for presidential
candidates in both parties. The tag that has hurt most reads
``liberal.'' Those who could fought back by enforcing the right to
tell voters what the term meant.
   And if that bit of history weren't warning enough, George Bush
had told the Democrats he was coming at them on ideology.
   Dukakis' late conversion is risky. The safer time to define a
candidate and his philosophy is by midsummer, not midautumn, nine
days before the voters choose a president.
   The Massachusetts governor had tried to position himself as a
candidate for whom ideology wouldn't count. His organization saw to
it that the Democrats adopted a brief, vague party platform, in
marked contrast to the book-length catalogue of promises the party
had issued four years earlier.
   Bush insisted that ideology was an issue, and when the Democrats
left him the opening, he proceeded to define the word ``liberal'' to
mean someone who is soft on crime, soft on national defense, likely
to spend too much money and therefore force higher taxes. He then
proceeded to attach the word to Dukakis.
   An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll reflects the impact. Four
surveys, the latest in mid-October, show a steady progression in the
number of likely voters who consider Dukakis too liberal to be a
good president, to 37 percent, up 11 points from midsummer.
   After weeks of resisting the liberal description, and after
complaining about Bush's use of the tab in nationally televised
debate, Dukakis shifted on Sunday and proclaimed that he is indeed a
liberal, ``in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman
and John Kennedy.''
   He said that means working for the average American, helping
those who need help, and at the same time, paying the government's
bills. His problem is that Bush has had most of the campaign to
hammer at his definition of the term, insisting that it puts Dukakis
out of the American mainstream.
   ``This election isn't about ideology,'' Dukakis told the
Democratic National Convention in accepting his nomination on July
21. ``It's about competence.''
   That statement is more often quoted than the telling
counterpointing Bush supplied in his own acceptance speech. ``...
Competence is a narrow ideal,'' the vice president said.
``Competence makes the trains run on time but doesn't know where
they're going. Competence is the creed of the technocrat ....
   ``The truth is, this election is about the beliefs we share, the
values we honor, the principles we hold dear.''
   Bush was trailing in the public opinion polls at that point, by
margins similar to those that now read in his favor.
   The rhetoric of August foretold a big part of the campaign
strategy that has reversed the odds. Bush tells his campaign rallies
that beliefs and values are behind his differences with Dukakis on
such matters as prison furloughs and a requirement that teachers
lead pupils in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
   ``The liberal governor of Massachusetts,'' Bush says over and
over again, disagrees with him.
   The fiercest battles over political labeling often have come
during struggles for presidential nomination, not afterward.
   Bush says Dukakis claimed liberal credentials when he needed them
to win Democratic primaries, on his way to the nomination, and then
tried to move to the middle. That kind of positioning isn't unusual;
it is done in both political parties.
   Indeed, over the course of his career, Bush has done some of it
himself. When he ran for the GOP nomination in 1980, he was cast as
a moderate Republican against the conservative who won _ Ronald
Reagan. When he lost a Senate seat 10 years earlier in Texas, it was
as a relatively liberal Republican, beaten by a Democrat who
outflanked him on the right on some issues. The Democrat was Lloyd
Bentsen.
   And when Reagan turned to Bush for the vice presidential
nomination in 1980, a good many GOP conservatives were outraged.
They knew Bush by his resume and by his reputation; if he'd run
against Reagan he must be out of the party's liberal wing.
   He wasn't. But to victorious conservatives _ the ones who later
complained that Reagan was acting pragmatically _ any moderate was
suspect.
   The Republican labeling war was fiercest in 1964, with former
Sen. Barry Goldwater, conservative, in one corner and the late
Nelson A. Rockefeller, liberal, in the other. ``Liberal'' wasn't a
popular word in GOP circles then or now, so Rockefeller defined
himself as a mainstream Republican.
   Goldwater's conservatives won the battle and lost the war to
Lyndon B. Johnson's Democratic landslide. From that day, liberal
Republicans chose to designate themselves as moderates.
   While Dukakis likened his liberalism to men like Roosevelt,
Truman and Kennedy, he sidestepped when asked if he also was in the
liberal tradition of such Democrats as George McGovern and Walter
Mondale, both liberals, both big losers.
   Maybe he should have tried the formula described by George
Romney, an early loser in the contest for the 1968 GOP nomination:
   ``I'm as conservative as the Constitution, as liberal as Lincoln
and as progressive as Theodore Roosevelt,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis is running television
ads that tout his home ownership plan and trash his rival's trade
record, but only for the benefit of viewers in the key electoral
state of Ohio.
   The Ohio campaign, aimed at stretched working families, is one of
several specialized televisin and radio appeals mounted by Dukakis
and Republican George Bush in states critical to their presidential
ambitions.
   The crossfire has been particularly heavy in California, Texas
and Ohio, and in states with large Hispanic voter populations. A
blitz of state-specific advertising is expected in the few days
before the election, with New York, New Jersey, Illinois and
Pennsylvania among the candidates for a final fusillade.
   One of the premier battlegrounds is California, with 47 electoral
votes and an electorate deeply concerned about the environment. Bush
jumped on that concern early, trying to alarm voters with the
specter of Boston's polluted harbor.
   ``Michael Dukakis says he wants to protect our environment. But
the EPA called Boston Harbor the dirtiest waterway in America,''
says an ad for the vice president. ``And now, Michael Dukakis says
he wants to do for America what he's done for Massachusetts.
California can't take that risk.'' Variations on the spot are also
running in New Jersey and Washington.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, is countercharging in
California that Bush's administration cut funds to clean up the
state's coast _ from San Francisco to Southern California in one ad,
from San Diego Harbor to San Francisco Bay in another.
   The ads say Bush opposed a crackdown on polluter corporations,
twice supported a veto of the Clean Water Act and end by saying,
``That's why the non-partisan League of Conservation Voters has
endorsed Michael Dukakis.''
   California Democrats have been among the most active in the
nation in creating their own ads. The state party is running two
vote-Democratic ads hitting the GOP record on education and the
environment, as well as three ``Dukakis is on your side'' spots
taped last week at a raucous Dukakis rally in Los Angeles.
   ``I want an America that's in charge of it's own future,'' the
candidate says in one of the rally ads. ``We're going to have clean
air, and clean water, and clean coasts, and a clean government in
Washington, D.C.''
   Texas, with 29 electoral votes, is another state under media
siege. Dukakis trotted out his running mate, popular Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, in an early spot stressing Bentsen's lead role in
passing plant-closing legislation and again more recently in an ad
called ``Partnership.''
   ``I've been fighting to build a future for Texas and the nation.
I now have a strong partner in that fight, and he's Mike Dukakis,''
says Bentsen. ``I know him, and you know me. We're going to put
America first.''
   In the latest ad featuring Bentsen, the Democratic candidate
accuses the Republicans of running a negative campaign and warns
voters that the GOP is ``trying to scare you with some phony
issues.''
   Another Dukakis ad accused Bush of failing to help Texas when it
was in the throes of the oil-business collapse.
   ``When a quarter of a million Texas jobs were lost, where was
George?'' the ad asks. ``When 192 Texas banks closed, and 23,000
Texas businesses failed, where was George?''
   For his part, Bush called on retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Chuck
Yeager to instill fears about the safety of the state's 300,000
defense-related jobs should Dukakis be elected. Yeager, the first
man to break the sound barrier, says in the ad that ``liberal
Democrats'' advocating defense cuts would put those jobs at risk.
   Dukakis also ran two Texas commercials to counter a Bush TV
attack on his furlough program and a National Rifle Association
radio assault on his gun control stands. One Dukakis spot says Bush
voted for gun control while in Congress and Dukakis ``supports gun
ownership by hunters and sportsmen.'' The other says Dukakis ``took
action and changed'' the furlough program and reduced crime by 13
percent in his state.
   The economic populist pitch Dukakis has adopted in the final days
of his campaign emerged two weeks ago in Ohio, which has 23
electoral votes, in ads tailored to appeal to ``working families''
insecure about their economic futures.
   ``Michael Dukakis stands up for working families. How? Home
Start, a program to give families a chance to buy their first
home,'' an announcer declares in one Ohio spot as images of
construction sites, tree-lined streets and the Massachusetts
governor roll by. ``No new bureaucracies, no red tape ... For
America's working families, Michael Dukakis for president.''
   Another Ohio spot shows viewers the Japanese flag and says Bush
returned from Japan ``saying our trade relationship was superb.
Superb for Japan, maybe. Superb for Japanese workers. But bad news
for American working families.'' The American flag waves as the
announcer concludes, ``Michael Dukakis stands up to foreign
competition. Keep American jobs in America. Michael Dukakis for
president.''
   Both candidates are seeking Hispanic votes via TV and radio
stations in states with large Hispanic populations, Texas foremost
among them. Bush is using an ad featuring his Mexican
daughter-in-law, Columba, and his three Hispanic grandchildren. The
ad _ in both English and Spanish versions _ currently is airing in
Texas and New York.
   Dukakis is running TV spots on education, crime control and his
immigrant heritage on two national Hispanic networks, Univision and
Telemundo. The commercials end with the Spanish-speaking governor
addressing viewers and a tagline that says ``he speaks our
language.''

   Montanan John Melcher is using pastoral
politics in his fight to retain his U.S. Senate seat and prevent
Conrad Burns from becoming the state's first Republican senator
since 1952.
   ``Every election some greenhorn runs against Doc Melcher,'' says
a talking cow in one Melcher campaign ad. ``They come in thinking
they can put Doc out to pasture.''
   ``But they leave with egg on their faces, and even worse on their
shoes,'' chuckles another cud-chewing bovine.
   Melcher, a veterinarian and two-term senator, holds a
double-digit lead over Burns in recent state polls, but the
Republican county commissioner from Billings is waging a spirited
challenge.
   ``I just think John Melcher is completely out of step with the
majority of Montanans,'' says Burns, who has been hammering away at
his opponent as ``too liberal'' and an ineffective member of the
Senate.
   The liberal accusation is nothing new for Melcher, who was
targeted for defeat by the National Conservative Political Action
Committee in 1982.
   He responded with TV ads that featured talking cows ridiculing
NCPAC as a herd of city-slickers trying to fool Montanans about
``old Doc Melcher.''
   Earlier this year, Burns picked up on the theme, warning voters
that Doc Melcher's cows would be ``spreading real bull'' this
election. In response, the incumbent senator again trotted out his
campaign cows.
   Melcher, 64, a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee,
portrays himself as a fighter who stands up for family farmers,
workers and Montana's basic industries _ timber, mining and
agriculture.
   In 1985, he fought Reagan administration attempts to reduce price
supports for grain, cotton and rice.
   ``If what I get done is beneficial, then that's how I should be
judged,'' he says. ``There are very few people in Congress who
understand what the West is all about.''
   Melcher is also considered something of a maverick. He was one of
only two senators who voted against the Omnibus Drug Bill of 1986,
one of only three who opposed the 1986 tax overhaul bill, and one of
only three who voted against the U.S.-Canadian trade agreement this
year.
   Melcher received high ratings from many liberal groups, but he
has voted with conservatives on several key issues.
   He opposed the Panama Canal treaty in 1978, supported Reagan's
1981 tax cuts and the balanced-budget law and is a staunch opponent
of abortion.
   Burns, 53, operated a farm-and-ranch broadcasting service until
he ran for commissioner in Montana's largest county in 1986. He
upset the Democratic incumbent, and announced earlier this year he
would take on Melcher.
   ``There's quite a bit of dissatisfaction here in the state of
Montana,'' he says. ``I don't think we can stand six more years of
the same.''
   folksy, personable campaigner, Burns has been barnstorming the
state, meeting voters door-to-door. He says his outgoing, friendly
style will be more effective in the Senate than Melcher's
``obstructionist'' tactics.
   But Burns' media campaign carries a strident tone, labeling
Melcher as soft on drugs, crime, and defense, and describing him as
a big-spending liberal who likes to raise taxes.
   Some of Burns' advertising was prepared with help from the
Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, which helped recruit him
as a candidate and considers him one of the GOP's best shots at
knocking off an incumbent Senate Democrat in 1988.
   Burns' Montana managers have denied suggestions that the national
committee is calling the shots for the campaign, but say the
assistance is welcome and needed to offset Melcher's 2-to-1
advantage in campaign funds.
   Despite polls showing him behind, Burns is convinced he has a
chance. He says his agricultural background will help him cut into
Melcher's power base in eastern Montana, which Melcher represented
in Congress for 7{ years.
   ``I think it's going to be tighter than a new pair of shoes,''
Burns says of the election.

   The Reagan administration is again in court
defending its refusal to do anything about acid rain in Canada,
while at the same time it has signed a new international accord
limiting one of acid rain's main constituents.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said the accord signed
Tuesday in Sofia, Bulgaria, by agency administrator Lee M. Thomas
means ``no additional regulatory actions are required'' by the
United States against oxides of nitrogen.
   These combustion products become acid rain in the atmosphere and
help form urban smog. One of them is responsible for the color of
the ``brown cloud'' that hangs over smoggy cities such as Los
Angeles.
   Lawsuits were filed Tuesday in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia seeking to force the EPA to require
states to revise their air pollution control plans to eliminate
damage to Canada.
   This is the same question that the plaintiffs, the Canadian
province of Ontario, the Izaak Walton League and the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Foundation, lost in a previous court round.
   Though the EPA under the Carter Administration had declared that
acid rain originating in the United States was harming Canada, the
court ruled that such a declaration was not enough to force the
states to act. Formal EPA regulations are required, the court said.
   The EPA has argued that not enough is known about acid rain to
draw up a control program.
   ``We cannot afford to hold our breath waiting for the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to wake up and smell the sulfur,''
Ontario environment minister Jim Bradley told the provincial
legislature in announcing the new lawsuit.
   The major component of acid rain in the eastern United States and
Canada is sulfuric acid formed from sulfur dioxide emitted by
utility and factory boilers.
   The New York state attorney general's office said it was
preparing a renewal of a related suit on behalf of New York, New
Jersey, Minnesota and the six New England states.
   In Bulgaria, the United States joined a nitrogen oxides annex to
the United Nations-sponsored treaty on Long-Range Transboundary Air
Pollution.
   In negotiation, the United States sought a 20 percent credit
against emissions limits to compensate for reductions in U.S.
emissions that had not yet been matched by European countries.
   In a compromise, the negotiators chose a ``pick your limit''
requirement. Emissions in any year through 1987, the particular year
chosen by each signing country, will be the limit in the 1990s. In
addition, the annual average for the period 1987-1996 may not exceed
1987 emissions.
   For the United States, this amounts to about a 5 percent credit.
Nitrogen oxides peaked in 1978 at 22.4 million tons and are now
about 20.3 million tons. Forty-four percent comes from
transportation, mostly motor vehicles, and a little under half from
boilers.
   Though new cars emit only a quarter of the nitrogen oxides that
they did in the 1960s, travel has grown so much that total emissions
are declining only slowly, and EPA expects the total to turn up
again in about 1995, reaching 20.2 million tons in 2000.
   The United States refused to sign an earlier sulfur dioxide
agreement pledging 30 percent emissions reductions. It said that
would be unfair since U.S. emissions have fallen by a much larger
amount than those in European countries.

<HEAD>Economists Says S&L Losses For Summer Were Sharply Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Losses by the nation's savings industry dropped
sharply last summer as the government transferred to its own books
billions of the industry's accumulated red ink, a government
economist said.
   Final figures for the July-September quarter aren't due out until
next month, but James Barth, chief economist of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, said Tuesday that the nation's 3,048 S&Ls lost
about $2 billion.
   That's substantial, but it's down significantly from losses of
$3.6 billion in the previous quarter and $3.9 billion in the first
three months of this year.
   S&Ls, hard hit in depressed oil regions of the Southwest, are
suffering their worst year since the Depression. The industry last
earned a small profit in the first three months of 1987.
   Barth, speaking at the U.S. League of Savings Institutions annual
convention, attributed shrinking losses to regulators' stepped-up
pace of S&L rescues and closings, totaling 137 so far this year.
   ``Losses, rather than being reported on the books of the
institutions, are being transferred to the books of the (deposit)
insurance fund,'' he said.
   Also, because most of the rescue packages guarantee restructured
institutions against future loss as well as taking away past loss,
there is no way of telling from industry numbers if losses in those
institutions are continuing.
   R. Dan Brumbaugh, a private analyst and former bank board
economist, said the new loss number does not necessarily indicate
the cost of cleaning up the S&L mess, estimated by regulators at $45
billion to $50 billion, is getting better.
   ``I would say the problem continues to grow,'' he said.
   Moreover, he said, thrift institutions, as well as commercial
banks, are more vulnerable now to an economic downturn than at any
time in 50 years.
   ``We have fragile institutions ... that could get significantly
worse even in a mild recession,'' Brumbaugh said.
   Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist of First Interstate Bancorp in
Los Angeles, said thrifts next year likely also face a one-half
percentage point increase in long-term interest rates and a full
point increase in short-term rates.
   Higher rates make it more expensive for thrift institutions to
acquire funds for lending.
   Thrift institutions in the past have struggled to remain
profitable during periods of rising rates, but James W. Christian,
chief economist of the U.S. League, said currently solvent
institutions would remain stable because rates on about a third of
the loans they hold fluctuate with the market.
   However, Barth warned that insolvent institutions in Texas, where
much of the industry's losses are concentrated, would be twice as
endangered by higher interest rates as solvent S&Ls.

<HEAD>Amnesty: Turkish Government Has As Poor A Rights Record As Military</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkey's civilian government has as bad a human
rights record as its military predecessor, torturing parents in
front of their children as part of a widespread campaign against
political opponents, Amnesty International said today.
   The London-based human rights organization said in a report that
torture continued against suspected opponents despite the
government's signing in August of the U.N. Convention Against
Torture.
   Amnesty said it has reports that five Turkish prisoners,
including a 13-year-old diabetic boy, died after torture in the
first half of 1988.
   The victims, Amnesty said, were among more than 250,000 Turks
arrested for political reasons since 1980. Several thousand
political prisoners were still held, it added.
   Amnesty said it has received more than 20 reports of prisoners
being tortured since Turkey ratified the U.N. convention.
   ``Torture continues, despite Turkey having signed and ratified
the United Nations Convention,'' the report said.
   ``Torture is widespread. Anyone arrested for political reasons is
at grave risk ... Young men and women are tortured in front of each
other. Parents are tortured in front of their children. Women held
hostage for their husbands are tortured.''
   The report said torture methods include electric shocks,
kickings, beating on the soles of the feet, sexual assault,
suspension by wrists or ankles, and deprivation of food, drink and
sleep.
   Amnesty spokeswoman Daphne Davies said copies of the report were
being sent to tour operators offering vacations in Turkey ``to give
them a full picture.''
   The report said that under the elected government that took over
in 1983, political prisoners were still being tried by military
courts. It said state security courts, intended to replace military
justice, did not conduct fair trials. The preceding military regime
had seized power in a 1980 coup.
   Of the political prisoners, Amnesty said ``some were convicted
for no more than expressing their opinions, many others because they
confessed to crimes of which they were innocent to escape the agony
of torture.''
   ``Most of these prisoners did not receive a fair trial. Some were
sentenced to death. Today almost 200 people await a decision on
whether they will go to the gallows,'' the report added.
   Among individual cases, Amnesty said Ibrahim Cicek, a member of
the banned Revolutionary People's Union, said in a letter from
prison that he and two friends were doused with water and made to
hold hands at an Istanbul police station in October 1987. Then an
electric current was turned on, passing through each of them and
resulting in what he described as ``a choir of screams.''
   The report said the diabetic teen-ager, Emin Ozkaya, died in
hospital in January after detention at a police station in Finike,
in southwest Turkey.
   Immediately after the military coup, violence between rival
political groups decreased but human rights abuses worsened, the
report said.
   ``Tens of thousands of men and women were taken into custody.
More than 30,000 were jailed in the first four months after the
coup. During the following years, Amnesty International received
thousands of allegations of torture including reports of over 100
deaths as a result of torture,'' the report said.
   ``People from most sectors of... society were put on trial,
teachers for their lessons, writers for their books, journalists for
articles they had written, trade unionists for organizing workers,
Kurds for separatist activities, religious leaders for their
sermons, students for attending seminars. Even lawyers have been
arrested and imprisoned for defending their clients,'' it said.
   Amnesty said its sources of information include victims, their
relatives, lawyers, journalists and medical, legal and human rights
aassociations with which it established contact during fact-finding
visits to Turkey.

<HEAD>Low-Income Might Benefit From Changed Payments System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-income recipients of government benefits
often are victims of a Catch-22: because they can't afford bank
accounts, they must pay high check-cashing fees _ even though the
checks are backed by Uncle Sam, says a new study.
   The study by the General Accounting Office says it might be
better if the money were made available to the recipients through
electronic transfer rather than by paper checks.
   Some consumer groups have advocated that banking institutions be
forced to cash government checks from non-customers, but the GAO
study released Tuesday suggests other ways.
   ``Use of electronic funds transfer technology, for example, has
been cited as a way to solve check-cashing problems by bringing more
government check recipients into the banking system,'' the study
said.
   ``Its use could also lower government costs and reduce banking
institution concerns about check forgeries and long lines in their
lobbies. Current technology can also make benefits available through
use of plastic cards at automatic teller machines and point-of sale
outlets.''
   The agency also suggested Congress require government departments
to work out a government-wide way of better delivery of benefits to
recipients as well as saving money.
   The GAO said 17 percent of the 92.9 million families in the
United States did not have banking accounts in 1985 and 56 percent
of those had incomes below $10,000 a year. To cash Social Security
or other checks these people often turn to 3,000 mostly unregulated
outlets, which charge check-cashing fees.
   The GAO believes that maintaining a low-cost banking account is
less expensive than using many check-cashing centers. While such an
account would cost up to $4 or more a month, the GAO said,
check-cashing centers usually charge more.
   ``For example, the Consumer Federation of America found that on
average, check cashers charged $8.47 to cash one $500 government
check,'' the study said. ``Even in New York, New Jersey, and
Illinois, where check-cashing center fees are regulated, cashing one
$500 government check costs between $3.85 and $7.50.''
   Requirements that banks cash government checks for non-customers
and provide low-cost checking accounts for poor people was part of a
proposed restructuring of the nation's financial system that died in
Congress last month. The restructuring foundered because of a
jurisdictional dispute between two House committees.
   The GAO says no definitive information exists on why some
families don't have bank accounts but that the reasons include
costs, including minimum balance requirements, asset limits in
welfare rules, mistrust of banking institutions, lack of
mathematical and reading skills, inconvenient bank hours and
account-opening requirements that require identification with a
major credit card.
   As for banks, they said they should not be required to cash
checks for non-customers because of costs, including providing extra
tellers on certain days, and ``the presence of large numbers of
individuals in banking institution lobbies the few days a month when
government checks are received.''

<HEAD>Farm Export Volume Expected To Decline This Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher prices point to another increase in the
value of U.S. agricultural exports in the 1989 fiscal year that
began Oct. 1, but an Agriculture Department analysis says the actual
volume of shipments is expected to decline.
   Exports of feed grains _ corn, sorghum, oats and barley _ could
decline by a much as one-tenth during the fiscal year, the report
said. Wheat shipments are more uncertain.
   Overall value of farm exports in the 1988 fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30 has been estimated by USDA at $34 billion, up from $27.9
billion the year before. The volume is estimated at 146 million
metric tons, up from 129.2 million tons the previous year.
   ``The volume of U.S. wheat exports (in 1989) is expected to fall
at least through May,'' the report said.
   Looking at corn and the other ``coarse'' grains, the department's
Economic Research Service said that ``substantial U.S. corn stocks
and expanding import demand probably will hold the fiscal 1989
decline in coarse grain export volume to around 10 percent.'' Higher
prices, however, will more than offset the decline in volume,
meaning a greater export value.
   For soybeans, higher market prices ``may about match decreases in
volume'' in 1989, resulting in ``little change in value'' from 1988,
the report said.
   The report did not include a forecast of 1989 export values and
volume. Those are scheduled for release by the agency on Nov. 29,
including preliminary figures for 1988.
   But the analysis, written by economist Stephen MacDonald, said
the 1989 export volume ``may decline because the drought has raised
prices by reducing supplies of grains and oilseeds. However, export
value may rise as higher prices and continued strong exports of
high-value products offset lower volume.''
   The report added that ``healthy economic growth overseas'' will
help keep exports of high-value products such as meat, fruits and
vegetables at current levels.
   ``In the past two years, U.S. agricultural exports have grown
roughly 30 percent in value and volume,'' the report said. ``The
U.S. share of world agricultural trade value has rebounded from
1986's 12 percent _ the lowest in over 25 years _ towards its
long-term average of 16 percent. Higher prices for grains, oilseeds
and other bulk products have been partly responsible.''
   The report said that most of the rebound came from a greater
volume of exports.
   ``A drop in support prices, the lower valued dollar, and
increased use of the Export Enhancement Program (subsidies) raised
the U.S. share of trade in bulk agricultural products from 35
percent in the 1985-86 crop year to 45 percent in 1987-88,'' the
report said. ``During 1988-89, the U.S. share probably will fall
somewhat, but it should remain above 1985-86.''

   This year's drought is expected to reduce 1988
production of dry beans by 25 percent to the lowest level in five
years, says an Agriculture Department report.
   Also, the drought ``had a substantial impact'' on the output of
snap beans, sweet corn, and green peas for processing as crops
withered in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois.
   The report issued Tuesday was a brief summary of a forthcoming
larger review. Other highlights of the U.S. vegetable situation this
season and in 1987 included:
   _Potato production will decline this year despite good crops of
winter and spring varieties. Summer and fall crops were hurt
severely by the drought. In 1987, by contrast, record high yields
and larger acreage pushed the total potato harvest up 7 percent to
385 million hundredweight.
   _Per capita use of all commercially produced vegetables dropped
1.4 pounds to an average of 325 pounds in 1987, with consumption of
fresh vegetables and potatoes declining for the first time since
1981.
   _Lettuce and tomatoes, which account for 45 percent of fresh
vegetable use, each declined in use last year, caused partly by
disease-reduced yields in Calfornia lettuce and poor tomato yields
in many minor producing states.
   _Vegetable imports grew 9 percent in 1987 to 4.9 billion pounds,
with 86 percent of the increase in fresh vegetables and potatoes.
   _The value of production for the 10 major fresh vegetables rose 7
percent in 1987, due mainly to higher prices for lettuce, onions and
tomatoes. The nine major processing vegetables increased 1 percent
in value, mostly because of higher prices for snap beans, sweet corn
and asparagus.

   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng says two
U.S. agricultural trade and development missions will visit four
African countries in 1989.
   One of the missions will visit Algeria and Tunisia. The other
will go to the Ivory Coast and Kenya, he said Tuesday. No dates have
been set for the visits.
   The missions will include representatives from USDA, State
Department and Agency for International Development, plus a number
from the private sector. Congress authorized the missions program in
1987 to help boost U.S. agricultural farm trade and development.
   So far, three missions have visited five countries _ Philippines,
Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico.

<HEAD>Government Resisting Homeless Effort To Use Surplus Plot Near
Pentagon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction workers who camp out in parks are
eying a plot of prime ``excess'' government land near the Pentagon
that is technically eligible for consideration as a site to shelter
the homeless.
   The Northern Virginia Union for the Homeless, which represents
the homeless construction workers and their families, wants to use
the land as a campsite and eventually would like to acquire it to
build low-income housing.
   The situation has sent federal officials on a frantic search for
surplus government land that would be a suitable alternative to the
site near the Pentagon.
   The 14.2 acres of land that is estimated to be worth millions of
dollars contains grassy areas and parking for 1,000 cars. The parcel
was identified by the homeless group as the only plot of ``excess''
federal land in the Washington area.
   The General Services Administration says the property is slated
to be used for possible expansion of the Pentagon and won't be
considered as a site to build low-income housing.
   The dispute pits the Reagan administration against a group of
workers who migrated to Washington from economically depressed
places such as West Virginia and Oklahoma to find work in the area's
booming construction market.
   Unable to afford hojudge ruled
Sept. 30 that property classified as ``excess'' must be considered
as possible sites to shelter the homeless under homeless legislation
passed last year by Congress.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch ordered GSA to identify all
underutilized government property that could be converted into
shelters for the homeless. He ruled that ``excess'' property fell
into that category as well.
   GSA spokesman Dale Bruce conceded that the Pentagon site falls
into the category described in the judge's order.
   ``The only point we can make on that is this is a very unique
situation. There are no other properties we are aware of across the
country that fall into this category. It really shouldn't be on
there.''
   The land was first listed ``in excess'' in 1966 by the Federal
Highway Administration following completion of interstate road
construction. Since then, the Navy has leased the property to
provide parking for employees at an office building near the
Pentagon, Bruce said.
   The site has been on the list ever since, even though GSA was
supposed to canvass other government agencies to find another use or
decide it should be declared surplus property.
   ``Each year it has been repermitted over to the Navy,'' Bruce
said. The land is now part of the Pentagon's master plan for use as
the site for more Defense Department offices, he said.
   ``This is simply on that list out of a technicality. We are
trying to do everything possible to identify optional sites for the
homeless which would hopefully serve the same purpose in the
Northern Virginia area,'' Bruce said.
   Ms. Aikens said government officials have appeared nervous at two
negotiating sessions.
   ``Given the fact that the property has been in excess for 22
years and nobody seems set to use it,'' she said, ``they are pretty
afraid of what a court might say if a question were put in front of
a judge.''

   In picking people to run the new president's
administration, transition aides can lean on suggestions in The
Prune Book, a compilation of the 100 toughest jobs in Washington.
   The book includes anecdotes from people who have held the
powerful policy and management positions in the various agencies and
lists the qualifications deemed necessary for the jobs.
   ``These jobs are the Mount Everest of anyone's career,'' said
Frank Weil, a former assistant secretary of commerce who worked with
the Center for Excellence in Government to produce the book.
   Here are some things transition teams should look at, according
to those who have held the positions.
   _The assistant secretary of state for African affairs needs
stamina: he spends about 25 percent of his time on the road and has
a grueling social schedule wining and dining African officials.
   _The undersecretary of state for management needs a thick skin:
``This is a job where you do not make anybody happy,'' said Ronald
Spiers, who has held the post since 1983.
   _The assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing and
inspection services should like reading government rules. And
learning Spanish is a good idea: he deals regularly with people from
Central America.
   _The CIA's general counsel should be a ``smart, savvy lawyer
who's been around,'' one former occupant said.
   The book, released to coincide with the transition to a new
administration, was written by John Trattner, a former State
Department spokesman in the Carter administration.
   The center, which sponsored the project, recruited teams of
former government officials who culled the lists of political
positions to select the toughest 100 jobs. All the positions require
Senate confirmation.
   The book's title is a play on words on the government's ``plum
book,'' which lists political jobs at the start of every new
administration. ``A prune is an older, wiser plum,'' Weil said.
   The next president could have as many as 6,000 jobs to fill in a
federal civilian bureaucracy that totals about 2.1 million.
   Trattner said the next president could jeopardize his
administration by selecting the wrong people for the 100 toughest
jobs.
   ``The people in this small group are the critical actors in the
life of any administration,'' he said.
   While government pay is not as high as that in the private
sector, many of the jobs are similar to those held by chief
executive officers of large corporations.
   Trattner said two of the most important positions in the 1990s
will be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and
the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, the person in charge
of procurement. Both jobs involve complicated issues and intersect
with private industry and Capitol Hill, he said.
   Since the top pay is no higher that $89,900, many people must
take a cut in salary to enter government.
   But that doesn't seem to deter applicants, some of whom see
government service as a star on their resume, Weil said.
   Officials at the center also said they don't think strict
post-employment ethics guidelines will dampen enthusiasm for
government service.
   ``Few people have any problems on the other side of the revolving
door,'' he said.

<HEAD>New York State Appeals Decision To Grant Power License for Nuke
Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York state and the Long Island county of
Suffolk are appealing a Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff
recommendation that the Shoreham nuclear plant be allowed to operate
at 25 percent of capacity, a lawyer says.
   Lawrence Lanpher, an attorney representing the county, said
Tuesday that the appeal argues Shoreham should not be permitted to
operate at any power level greater than 5 percent.
   The $5.4 billion nuclear reactor was completed in 1984 but never
opened.
   On Monday, the NRC staff submitted a report recommending that the
commission's director of nuclear reactor regulation ``be authorized
to issue a 25 percent of rated power license for Shoreham.''
   The staff based its conclusion on a safety evaluation report,
also written by NRC staff, which found that ``the risk and
consequences of accidents are greatly reduced at 25 percent power as
compared to full-power operation.''
   The license recommendation now goes to a three-judge panel of the
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, an arm of the NRC. If the board
reaches the same conclusion as the staff, the matter still must be
approved by the full commission before a 25 percent power license
can be granted.
   NRC spokesman John Kopeck said there was no timetable for the
matter to be resolved.
   The reactor has had a 5 percent testing license since 1985.
Full-power licensing became stalled over the refusal by state and
local governments to participate in emergency planning. They contend
the area around Shoreham could not be safely evacuated.
   Lanpher said the staff report failed to quantify the reduction in
risk at 25 percent of power as compared to full power.
   ``In fact, they talked in that report about how dangerous
radiation could still spread out to 10 miles and beyond if there
were an accident,'' he said. ``So we think this confirms the fact
that (the Long Island Lighting Co.) cannot be authorized to operate
at 25 percent power in advance of having an approved emergency
plan.''
   But Jim Lois, a Long Island Lighting spokesman, said the utility
was pleased by the finding.
   ``This supports our belief that the plant can operate safely as
we continue to find ways to bring much-needed energy to Long
Island,'' he said.

<HEAD>High School Students Barred From Books on Witchcraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at East Rome High School can't find
books on witchcraft on shelves at their school library, and they
must have parental permission to take out other ``controversial''
books, school officials said.
   The policy, which was adopted a few years ago by the school's
media committee, does not apply to any other high school in the city
or Floyd County, and two members of the school board want it
reviewed. The media committee is made up of the principal, librarian
and some teachers, parents and students.
   One school board member said the East Rome policy amounts to
unnecessary censorship.
   ``What we are doing is preventing certain books from hitting the
eyes of certain students,'' said Sandra Jones. ``I just think it's
so dangerous. It's horrifying.''
   Ms. Jones said her 17-year-old son, a student at East Rome High,
had received her permission last year when he sought to check out a
book on witchcraft from the school library.
   A guidance counselor contacted her anyway, saying school
officials decided not to allow her son to check out the book.
   ``They took the book off the shelf and would not let him check it
out,'' Ms. Jones said. ``How better can we get kids focusing in on
witchcraft and satanism than to tell them they can't read about it?''
   Certain other books _ such as ``The Color Purple'' by Alice
Walker, which includes descriptions of incest and lesbianism _ may
be taken out only with parental consent.
   Ms. Jones said she feels her son should be allowed to read the
books he chooses.
   ``Let him read a book. Praise God he wants to read a book,'' she
said. ``I had no problem with my son checking out the book.''
   East Rome librarian Vivian Strain explained that the school does
have provisions for some controversial books, but there are some
books ``we just plain don't buy.''
   ``We try not to have controversial materials,'' she said.
   Ms. Jones said the school board has not addressed the high
school's book policy because only two members agreed it should be on
the agenda, and four are required.

<HEAD>Security Man Drags Fergie To Safety As Ship Cable Snaps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A security man dragged the Duchess of
York to safety Wednesday when a steel cable tying her husband's
warship to the wharf snapped, narrowly missing the couple, officials
said.
   The potentially serious accident occurred as Sarah stood chatting
on Fremantle Port's Victoria Quay, with Prince Andrew, who was on a
lower deck of his ship HMS Edinburgh.
   The 2-inch steel hawser, which helped secure the ship to the
dock, snapped with a crack toward the bow of the guided-missile
destroyer and snaked back along the ship's side.
   A television reporter said the duchess was less than 10 feet away
and a detective with Sarah, hearing the noise, grabbed her by the
arm and pulled her back from the side of the dock as the steel rope
went past.
   ``It was pretty close,'' said a dock worker.
   Channel 7 television said Prince Andrew and other crew members
ducked for cover as the cable smashed into the ship's hull. It said
Andrew appeared angry at the incident and had ``stern words'' with
an enlisted man.
   The couple soon recovered their composure and waved white
handkerchiefs at each other as the ship sailed out on schedule.
   The duchess was to leave for London later Wednesday after a visit
that came under strong criticism from British newspapers over her
decision to leave her newborn daughter at home in the care of a
nanny.
   The duchess encountered controversy after extending an official
10-day bicentennial visit by another four weeks while she followed
her husband around to various ports.
   Prince Andrew is expected back in Britain on Dec. 16.

   Republican conservatives and moderates argue
among themselves over just what political stripes George Bush would
wear if he wins the White House next week, and some recent campaign
utterances aren't making the labeling job any easier.
   Speaking at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., on
Tuesday, the vice president talked for the first time of the kind of
judges he would pick, if elected, for prospective Supreme Court
vacancies.
   ``I will appoint moderate persons of conservative views,'' Bush
declared.
   And, while he went on to fault what he called the ``excessive
judicial activism of the '60s and '70s,'' his statement appeared
designed to send a calming message to moderates that he would not
appoint doctrinaire right wingers to the bench _ while at the same
time allowing him to flash once more his credentials as a
conservative.
   The Notre Dame remarks _ in which Bush seemed to be having it
both ways _ underscore what many analysts view as Bush's split
political personality.
   Would he follow through as the designated heir to Ronald Reagan's
brand of conservatism?
   Or would he revert to the moderate Bush of yore who favored the
Equal Rights Amendment, opposed a constitutional ban on abortions
and dismissed Reagan's 1980 proposal for tax cuts as ``voodoo
economics?''
   Both sides are keeping their fingers crossed.
   ``Basically, he's more moderate than his image has been of recent
years,'' says Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt., a GOP moderate. ``I think
some of the more conservative issues that President Reagan has
brought to the forefront _ like abortion _ will be more on the back
burner with George Bush. ... That's what we're hoping.''
   On the other hand, David Carmen, a political consultant who was a
key adviser to conservative Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., says of Bush:
``He's actually run to the right of Reagan on some issues, like
abortion and so-called family issues. I think he'll be a
conservative president.''
   Bush, never accused of ideological rigidity, was a Goldwater
Republican in 1966 when he was first elected to Congress, a
Rockefeller Republican in 1980 when he first sought the presidency
and a Reagan Republican ever since.
   Views are mixed on just how moderate or how conservative a Bush
presidency would be.
   ``There's plenty evidence for either interpretation,'' said
William Schneider, a political analyst for the American Enterprise
Institute. ``The moderates think he's one of them: `Good old George,
we've known him for years.'''
   ``But he's also been running a tough ideological campaign, going
down the line conservative on all the major social issues, hitting
all the hot buttons.''
   ``He's going to have to choose which George Bush he is _ the
kinder, gentler Bush or one who says, `Read my lips.' He can't keep
on doing this forever,'' Schneider added.
   Many Bush watchers suggest that, if elected, his presidency is
more likely to resemble the middle-of-the-road policies of former
GOP Presidents Nixon and Ford than the ideological conservatism of
Reagan or the more liberal wing of the party represented by the late
Nelson Rockefeller.
   Still, Brent Scowcroft, who was national security adviser in the
Ford administration and is now a Bush consultant on international
issues, says the vice president is likely to be a ``Rockefeller
Republican in foreign policy.''
   ``Tough, hardheaded, no illusions, more or less power-politics
oriented, with somewhat of less ideological content,'' Scowcroft
said in an interview.
   Bush, in campaign speeches, has signaled a keen interest in
negotiating further nuclear arms reduction pacts with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, seems less committed than Reagan to going full
speed ahead with the ``Star Wars'' strategic defense shield, and has
emphasized negotiating cuts in East-West conventional armies in
Europe.
   On domestic issues, Bush has taken up the conservative banner and
waved it, coming out strongly against gun control and in favor of
the death penalty, urging a ban on abortions, talking repeatedly of
the Pledge of Allegiance in classrooms and criticizing the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   But, at the same time, Bush has argued for stronger protection of
the environment, has called for an increase in the minimum wage _ if
accompanied by a lower minimum for young workers _ and has proposed
a tax credit that could be used for day care.
   In addition, the men Bush has surrounded himself with _ and who
appear to be in line for key Cabinet posts in a Bush administration
_ tend to be moderates, many of them from the East.
   They include former Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh, now the
attorney general; Nicholas Brady, a former New York investment
banker who is now the treasury secretary; former Treasury Secretary
and longtime friend James A. Baker III, former deputy Treasury
Secretary Richard Darman and Harvard economist Martin Feldstein.
   ``It's looking like it's going to be an Eastern Establishment
administration,'' said Richard Viguerie, a conservative direct-mail
specialist.
   If Baker, who practiced a brand of non-ideological pragmatism
both as Reagan's first-term chief of staff and as treasury
secretary, were to become secretary of state in a Bush presidency,
as is widely assumed, that would complicate life even further for
conservatives, Viguerie said.
   ``Jim Baker over the years rejected confrontation with liberals.
It would make a Bush administration much more in tune with the Nixon
administration, and we're concerned about that. We're apprehensive.''
   Still, Viguerie, echoing sentiments of other Republicans of
various political persuasions, says he doesn't want to be a naysayer.
   ``I'm concerned about being negative at this point. I want him to
have a massive landslide. And then, the day after the election, is
when conservatives will speak out loud and clear.''
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a GOP moderate, says he expects Bush to
be staunchly conservative on budget issues ``in terms of restraining
spending,'' but more progressive on other domestic matters.
   ``He's made it clear he will give a greater priority to day care,
will be more environmentally sensitive. Bush doesn't wear
progressiveness on his sleeve but is very likely to get substantial
results,'' Leach said.

   Koo Stark, a New York-born actress who had a
much-publicized relationship in 1982 with Prince Andrew, sued for
libel damages from a weekly newspaper that said she secretly dated
the prince after her marriage.
   Ms. Stark said Tuesday the December 1985 report in Sunday People
was untrue and spoiled her hopes of reconciliation with her husband,
Timothy Jefferies, who had left her the previous month after 16
months of marriage.
   Sunday People owner Robert Maxwell has denied her allegations.
   Ms. Stark, 32, made a new career as a stage actress and as a
photographer after her friendship with Prince Andrew, second son of
Queen Elizabeth II, cooled early in 1984. The prince married Sarah
Ferguson in July 1986.

   NBC's ``Cheers'' started off its seventh season
in second place, right behind ``The Cosby Show,'' and season
premieres finally outnumbered reruns in the weekly A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings.
   The highest-rated new show last week was NBC's ``Tattinger's''
which won its time period on Wednesday night and tied for 26th place
in the rankings.
   Despite critics' complaints of tastelessness, the Geraldo Rivera
special ``Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground'' ranked fifth
with a rating of 21.9 and a 33 share.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with televisions. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The sitcoms ``Roseanne'' on ABC and ``Dear John'' on NBC
continued in the top 10 and were looking more and more like the
first new hits of the season.
   Last week's top 10 prime-time shows were: ``The Cosby Show,''
``Cheers,'' and ``A Different World,'' all NBC; ``60 Minutes'' CBS;
``Devil Worship'' NBC; ``Monday Night Football'' ABC; ``Golden
Girls'' NBC; ``Roseanne'' and ``Growing Pains'' ABC; and ``Dear
John'' NBC.
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 16.4. ABC was second
with 13.7 and CBS third with 12.8.
   CBS didn't fare well with new shows from Mary Tyler Moore and
Dick Van Dyke. Moore's ``Annie McGuire'' had a 9.7 and 15 share and
ranked 57th, barely above ``The Van Dyke Show'' in the bottom 10,
63rd out of 68 rankings with a 9.0 and 14.
   CBS also had little success with the one-hour premiere of ``Dirty
Dancing,'' based on the hit movie, though its 56th place 9.8 and 18
is better than CBS has been doing in the Saturday time period.
   CBS' ``Paradise,'' a Western starring Lee Horsley that goes up
against the NBC Thursday lineup, ranked 32nd.
   The highest-rated movie of the week, in sixth place, ABC's
``David,'' was the compelling real-life story of the little boy
whose father severely burned him. Next highest was NBC's ``A Stoning
in Fulham County'' at 17th.
   Part one of NBC's political thriller ``Favorite Son'' won the
Sunday night movie battle, narrowly edging ABC's theatrical,
``Commando.'' They ranked 24th and 25th, respectively. The first
part of CBS' ``Dadah Is Death,'' about a young man sentenced to die
for drug smuggling in Malaysia, was 53rd.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' nudged the ``CBS Evening News'' to
win the news ratings. ABC had a 10.7 and 21 share, CBS a 10.5 and 20
share. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.8 and 20.

<HEAD>Commune Leader Stole Student Money, Prosecutors Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former members of a commune will
testify in the conspiracy trial of the group's leader that he
plotted to obtain illegal student loans to prepare for the world's
economic collapse, prosecutors say.
   Opening arguments began Tuesday in the trial of George G.
Jurcsek, and his lieutenant Mary O'Rourke. The pair, both of
Mocksville, N.C., were charged in May 1987 with conspiracy and theft
by deception.
   Former members of the Circle of Friends testified at a grand jury
hearing that the commune was a tightly controlled group led by
Jurcsek, whose main purpose was allegedly to defraud the state
student loan agency and several credit card companies out of more
than $150,000.
   On Tuesday, deputy state Attorney General John M. Fahy told the
Superior Court jury that Jurcsek and Ms. O'Rourke controlled about
32 Circle of Friends members who applied for about 64 guaranteed
student loans.
   Fahy said Jurcsek's hold on the group, which was based in nearby
Randolph and was comprised mostly of young women, was based on his
preaching of economic doom and of the inevitable collapse of the
world economy by the turn of the century.
   In grand jury testimony that has been made public as a result of
pretrial motions, several government witnesses described Jurczek, a
68-year-old Hungarian immigrant, as a man bent on leading the world
after the collapse.
   ``He presented himself as a mystic and a psychic who has the
ability to foresee the future,'' said Barbara Edwards, a former
member who testified for the government. ``We considered ourselves
students and he our teacher.''
   Another former member, Diane Desiderio, said she participated in
the fraud schemes because Jurcsek taught her ``that possession was
nine-tenths of the law'' and that when the world economy failed it
would be better to have money no matter how it was obtained.
   Defense attorneys for Jurcsek and Ms. O'Rourke tried to discredit
the government's case as one based on hearsay. The witnesses, the
attorneys said, were either embittered because they left the group
or were simply cooperating with authorities to obtain immunity from
prosecution.

   Juliette Powell, of St. Laurent, Quebec, becoming
the first mixed-race contestant to be crowned Miss Canada, said her
victory is proof multiculturalism thrives in Canada.
   The 18-year-old Miss Laurentians was among 46 candidates from
across Canada who competed in the 42nd annual contest, which was
televised live nationally.
   ``I'm proud to be the first mulatto (winner) and I will gladly
serve as a role model for both white and black Canadians,'' she said
in a telephone interview after Tuesday's ceremony.
   Ms. Powell said, ``The title has nothing to do with politics ...
I don't see Miss Canada as a political figure. I see it as someone
who represents Canada and its people.''
   Ms. Powell was born in New York City but moved to Canada as a
child and now holds dual citizenship. She is a part-time model and a
second-year commerce student at Vanier College in St. Laurant.
   The first runner up was Kari Lee Hudson, Miss Toronto.
   Ms. Powell was given about $100,000 in cash and prizes including
a new car and mink coat. She will represent Canada in the Miss
Universe pageant next May.

<HEAD>Sources Say D'Amato Put Hold on Republican Judicial Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nomination of Stuart A. Summit, a Park
Avenue lawyer and a Republican, to a judgeship on the 2nd Circuit
Court of Appeals was blocked in the final days of the last Congress
by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., sources said.
   Summit, a partner with Summit, Rovins & Feldesman, received the
unanimous approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee in September
after several hearings. But his nomination never reached the Senate
floor, and a source on Capitol Hill and another familiar with the
nomination said it was D'Amato who put a hold on it.
   D'Amato did not return numerous phone calls over several weeks
seeking comment. On Tuesday his spokesman, Ed Martin, declined
comment when asked whether D'Amato blocked Summit.
   Traditional ``senatorial courtesy'' allows a senator to put a
hold on a judicial nomination, which effectively kills it. The
identity of the senator is usually kept secret.
   D'Amato's action was ironic since it came on the heels of
complaints from GOP senators that Democrats had held up 25 of their
judicial nominees for more than a year. In retaliation, Republicans
blocked floor votes on key pieces of legislation until a compromise
could be reached. Eleven of those nominees were then approved and
sent to the floor, but Summit never crossed the finish line.
   Summit said in a telephone interview Tuesday he had heard rumors
for some time that his nomination was blocked but did not know for
sure that D'Amato was responsible.
   ``If it is true, I'm amazed,'' he said. ``I cannot imagine why.''
   Summit said he had put in at least three calls to D'Amato to find
out if the report were true but D'Amato had not called back. On
Tuesday, Summit said he had given up trying.
   Summit's nomination was engineered in large part by Arnold Burns,
his former law partner who at the time was the No. 2 official at the
Justice Department. But Summit lost his champion when Burns resigned
from Justice last spring to protest then-Attorney General Edwin
Meese's ethical problems.
   Summit said he understood that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
had tried to intervene on his behalf.
   Summit, who seemed baffled by the politicization of his
nomination, noted that D'Amato had even spoken at his confirmation
hearings.
   ``He very kindly attended the hearing in April of 1988 and spoke
well of my credentials,'' Summit said.
   D'Amato's motives in blocking the nomination are unclear. The New
York Law Journal and Manhattan Lawyer, two legal journals in New
York City, have reported that D'Amato held up Summit in retaliation
for the Judiciary Committee's treatment of two candidates he had
recommended for the Eastern District benches: State Supreme Court
Justices Robert Roberto Jr. and Howard E. Levitt, both of Long
Island.
   Roberto, a former prosecutor, withdrew in June after the
Judiciary Committee learned he had engaged in a sex act with a
16-year-old prostitute while investigating a massage parlor in 1971.
Roberto claimed his action was necessary for conviction and noted
that he had testified about it in open court during prosecution of
the case.
   Levitt's nomination effectively died last month when the
Judiciary Committee pulled his name from the agenda of one of its
last meetings this session. A committee aide, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said he was pulled because the panel could not reach a
consensus.
   D'Amato said recently he would resubmit Levitt's name for
consideration next year.

   Sen. Dan Quayle is warning Republicans
against overconfidence in the waning days of the presidential
campaign, saying the GOP could end up like Thomas Dewey in 1948.
   Arriving here Tuesday night at the end of a long campaign day in
Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, Quayle said ``the polls have been all
over the lot.''
   ``We believe, in fact, we have a small but marginally
insignificant lead,'' he told reporters.
   Two nationwide surveys released Tuesday night show the Republican
ticket of George Bush and Quayle holding double-digit leads of 12
and 13 points in the final week before the election.
   Earlier, while campaigning for Indiana Lt. Gov. John Mutz, who is
trying to succeed Robert Orr in Quayle's homestate of Indiana, the
senator sought to deflect burgeoning speculation about whether his
wife, Marilyn, might be appointed to fill his vacant Senate seat in
the event of a Bush-Quayle victory next Tuesday.
   ``It's going to be Bob Orr's decision,'' Quayle said of talk
within Republican Party circles in the state that Mrs. Quayle might
be offered the vacant seat. During an interview last weekend on the
syndicated program ``McLaughlin: One on One,'' Quayle's wife refused
to flatly rule out such a possibility.
   ``I think it's a real honor for her to be considered,'' Quayle
told reporters in Evansville. ``I'm not going to do anything to
disrupt the discussion. ... Of course, we've got a family, and life
is going to change a lot'' if the Bush-Quayle ticket is elected, he
said.
   Quayle was appearing at a campaign rally today in this ``City on
the Bluffs'' before traveling to Owensboro, Ky. He has appearances
scheduled later in the week in Greenville and Spartanburg, S.C., and
in Oklahoma and Alabama.
   The senator, who complained about last-minute scheduling changes
dictated by the Bush campaign headquarters in Washington, seemed
buoyed by two appearances in his homestate, one in Jeffersonville
and the second in Evansville.
   Red, white and blue balloons sailed in front of a flag-waving,
cheering crowd as the band struck up ``Back Home in Indiana.''
   But when he arrived in Memphis in late evening, Quayle deflected
questions which assumed a Republican Party victory at the polls.
   ``We believe this election could still go either way,'' he said.
``We're not taking anything for granted. That would be absolutely
lethal.''
   ``One way you can lose an election is to sit back, and relax, and
we'll end up like Dewey did,'' Quayle said.
   He was referring to Thomas Dewey's upset loss to Democrat Harry
Truman 40 years ago in an election that virtually all the experts
had given to Dewey.

   A suspect in bank stickups in five states from
Florida to California shot himself in the mouth when police cornered
him in Oklahoma, where he fled after running out of a bank here,
authorities said.
   Michael Allen Cadwell, 45, of Hallandale, Fla., was in critical
but stable condition late Tuesday at Parkland Memorial Hospital in
Dallas, said hospital spokesman Paul Long.
   Cadwell is a suspect in bank robberies in Dallas, Houston, Los
Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, Tulsa, Okla., and Washington, D.C.,
said Dick Newth of the FBI here. The amount of money taken was not
revealed and no charges in those bank robberies have been filed.
   A man walked into a Savings of America Bank in Dallas on Tuesday
morning, but fled when an employee noticed a bulge under his jacket
and recognized him as the man who robbed the bank July 5, Newth said.
   The FBI relayed a description of the man's car to police
departments in Texas and Oklahoma.
   Oklahoma authorities said they spotted a car matching the
description traveling on Interstate 35 about 15 miles north of the
Texas border. Officers chased the car at speeds hitting 115 mph.
   The man left the interstate nine miles south of Ardmore, Okla.,
and tried to escape on country roads, said Oklahoma Department of
Public Safety Lt. Gene Loman.
   About five patrol cars surrounded the car when it pulled into a
driveway. As officers secured the area, they heard a gunshot, Loman
said.
   Cadwell had shot himself in the mouth with a .38-caliber
revolver, police said.

<HEAD>Justice Department Is Investigating Its Top Porn Prosecutor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is investigating its
chief pornography prosecutor for possible misuse of travel funds,
government sources said.
   The Office of Professional Responsibility, which examines
allegations of wrongdoing by department employees, is carrying out
the probe of H. Robert Showers with the assistance of FBI agents,
the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated
Press.
   Investigators are trying to determine whether Showers scheduled
official trips at taxpayer expense that permitted him to attend
meetings of Christian religious groups in his hometown of Raleigh,
N.C., and other cities, the sources said Tuesday.
   Justice Department regulations specify that employees must use
the least expensive form of travel when engaging in government
business.
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell and FBI spokesman
William Carter declined to confirm that any investigation of Showers
is under way.
   The sources, however, said investigators are studying whether
Showers, while traveling on department business, took indirect
flights to cities hundreds of miles out of his way to attend
religious meetings.
   The Long Island, N.Y., newspaper Newsday reported Monday that
investigators have been told that Showers arranged meetings with
federal prosecutors during the same weeks as Baptist conventions,
that he arranged to change planes in the city hosting the
convention, attended the religious meetings and then continued on to
the city where he conducted department business.
   Newsday also quoted sources as saying that several of Showers'
conferences with prosecutors were extremely brief and that there is
a possibility Showers may have taken trips that were unnecessary.
The sources told Newsday that Showers traveled at government expense
to Raleigh many times, attending religious meetings there.
   Showers was named to head up the department's National Obscenity
Enforcement Unit in 1986 by Attorney General Edwin Meese III. He had
been an assistant U.S. attorney in Raleigh, N.C., before being
brought to Washington as a special assistant to Meese.
   The Office of Professional Responsibility scrutinized Showers
earlier this year after he allegedly asked a colleague to destroy a
memo in connection with a pornography case, sources said at the time.
   Showers has been placed on administrative leave.

<HEAD>Minkow: `I Was Just A Front Man For The Mob'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the press hailed him as young superstar
and Wall Street poured millions into his ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning
company, Barry Minkow says he was ``just a front man for the mob.''
   The 22-year-old Minkow, crying on the witness stand at his
federal securities fraud trial, chronicled the rise and fall of his
sham company and admitted that the success of his
multimillion-dollar fraud went to his head.
   ``I had my Ferrari and I was the press' golden boy,'' he sobbed
Tuesday. ``I said, `Aren't I great? I'm Mr. Cool,' and then they
(mobsters) would put me in my place, that I was just a front man for
the mob.''
   Minkow, who admits he perpetrated the fraud on investors,
addressed his comments directly to the jurors as he sought to
convince them he was a victim of duress, not a con man acting on
free will as prosecutors allege.
   As the fraud escalated and the company went public in 1986,
Minkow said, he was throwing up blood every night from beatings by
the mob.
   Banks and investors handed over millions, unaware that by the
time ZZZZ Best traded on Wall Street, it was $7 million in debt and
was in the control of mobsters, he said.
   Minkow is charged with 57 counts of securities, credit card and
mail fraud. Ten other defendants have pleaded guilty. Accountant
Norman Rothberg is on trial with Minkow, charged with taking a bribe
to hide ZZZZ Best's frauds.
   Minkow took the stand as the first defense witness Oct. 25. The
prosecution rested its case on Oct. 21 after calling 47 witnesses
and introducing thousands of exhibits.
   Minkow testified that a cadre of organized crime figures who
claimed connections to the Genovese and Colombo crime families
dictated his every move as he prepared a $15 million stock offering.
   ``I just was a puppet,'' he said.
   Minkow, who started his carpet cleaning company at age 16 in his
parents' garage, said he was instructed by mobsters to conduct ``a
road show'' to sell investors on the financial wonders of ZZZZ Best
while perpetuating a massive fraud.
   He said he helped prepare a prospectus on the company which was
``a lie,'' and carried out a complex series of financial maneuvers
to show income that didn't exist. To do this, he said, he took $7
million in bank loans and he opened five branch offices.
   ``The offices were so we could show that we were the great
7-Eleven of carpet cleaning,'' he said. ``It was just so I could say
to the Wall Street bankers, `We're wonderful. Buy our stock.' And we
were nothing. We were losing money.''
   ``Was this your idea?'' defense attorney David Kenner asked
Minkow repeatedly as he detailed features of the fraud.
   ``No, it was not,'' said Minkow, who blamed mobsters.
   Asked why he never went to police, Minkow said he was afraid and
detailed alleged acts of brutality against him.
   He testified that once a mobster held his head underwater and
another time he was kicked in the groin for resisting the loan scam.
   ``I was scared to death,'' he said.

<HEAD>Studies: Vitamin Treatment May Slow Progression Of Parkinson's
Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vitamin E can ease a serious side effect of
schizophrenia medication and team up with vitamin C to help slow the
course of Parkinson's disease, which afflicts at least 350,000
Americans, two studies suggest.
   In both cases, it appeared to work by helping protect the brain
against damage from chemical entities called free radicals, which
are produced by the body, said the researchers, who described their
studies Tuesday at a conference on vitamin E, sponsored by the New
York Academy of Sciences.
   Jean Lud Cadet of the Columbia University College of Physicians
and Surgeons in New York said vitamin E appeared to reduce symptoms
of tardive dyskinesia, which appears in 20 percent to 30 percent of
people taking antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia or some
other illnesses.
   The condition produces jerky movements of the facial muscles and
slow writhing movements of the limbs and sometimes the trunk.
   Cadet's experiment found that 13 of 15 patients responded to
four-week treatments with vitamin E. Treatments cut the average
severity of symptoms almost in half, as measured by a standard
rating scale and compared to when patients took a placebo.
   ``That's really quite impressive,'' said John Davis, director of
research at the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute and a member of
the American Psychiatric Association's task force on tardive
dyskinesia.
   No proven treatment is known now for the condition, Davis said in
a telephone interview.
   Researchers hope to go beyond short-term easing of symptoms to
drugs that produce long-term elimination or reduction in symptoms,
he said. Investigation of why vitamin E helps patients may aid in
reaching that goal by revealing fundamental secrets of the
condition, he said.
   A separate study found that people in early stages of Parkinson's
disease who took vitamins E and C showed slower progression of
disease than other patients did.
   The 14 patients were able to delay starting standard treatment
for 2.5 years longer than other patients, said Stanley Fahn,
director of parkinsonism and movement disorder research at Columbia.
   Stressing that the results are preliminary, Fahn said researchers
at 28 institutions have signed up 800 patients for a $10 million
federally funded study of the approach.
   Parkinson's disease is often characterized by tremors, rigidity
or loss of balance. Drugs can control symptoms, but their effect can
become sporadic and side effects can include psychological
disturbances and impairment of movement.
   The disease is caused by death of brain cells that produce
dopamine, which brain cells use to communicate. Nobody know why the
cells die.
   Fahn said his experiment was based on a hypothesis that the cells
are harmed by free radicals created by the cells themselves.
Parkinson's may arise because the body cannot properly handle the
radicals, or it creates too many of them, he said.
   The vitamin experiment tested the idea of using anti-oxidants,
substances that can scavenge free radicals or slow their formation.
   The disease progressed more slowly in the 14 patients who took
high doses of the vitamins than in a group of patients observed in
Chicago who did not get the vitamin treatment, he said.
   The result is ``just a suggestion of a way to go, not an answer
in itself,'' Fahn said.
   The anti-oxidant approach is ``very promising,'' said Bala
Manyam, director of the Parkinson's disease and movement disorders
clinic at the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in
Springfield.
   Gunter Haase, director of the neurology department at the
Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, called the approach
interesting.
   ``If further studies bear out the reports by Dr. Fahn, then we
would have a very simple form of treatment not attended by any side
effects, which almost all other medications have,'' he said.
   The current federally funded study involves the biologically
active form of vitamin E, called tocopherol, and another
anti-oxidant called deprenyl. Their effects, singly and in
combination, are being compared against a placebo.

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA early Wednesday began
transporting space shuttle Atlantis to the launch pad for a late
November launch with a classified military satellite.
   A giant tracked transporter moved out of an assembly building at
1:13 a.m. EST to start the 4-mile trip to Launch Pad 39B. The move
was expected to take six to eight hours, with the vehicle traveling
at maximum speed of 1 mph.
   At the pad, Atlantis will be readied for the second shuttle
mission since the Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts on
Jan. 28, 1986. After a 32-month interval while shuttle modifications
were made, Discovery and a five-man crew completed a successful
mission in early October.
   Atlantis is scheduled to be launched about Nov. 28 with another
crew of five. A firm date will be set following a flight readiness
review Nov. 10.
   Because of the military nature of the flight, the Pentagon is
shrouding many details in secrecy. It has said the launch will occur
between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. but won't make the countdown public
until it reaches 9 minutes before the planned liftoff.
   It is believed Atlantis will carry an intelligence-gathering
satellite to help verify nuclear arms control treaties.

<HEAD>Former Operative For Drug Cartel Describes U.S. Distribution System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An American who said he helped import and
distribute 56 tons of cocaine gave the jury at a money-laundering
trial an inside look at the Colombian drug world.
   Max Mermelstein had testified as a government witness in two
other trials, but his testimony Tuesday at the trial of Carlos
Restrepo marked the first time he discussed the Medellin cartel's
operations in this country, said U.S. Attorney Stanley Twardy.
   The cartel, believed to be responsible for much of U.S. cocaine
imports, was described by Mermelstein as a loose-knit organization
of Colombia's cocaine traffickers.
   Mermelstein's testimony was offered to establish the identity of
key figures in the Colombian drug world and their methods of
operation, and not to suggest that Restrepo was a member of the
Medellin cartel, U.S. District Judge Jose Cabranes told the jury.
   The government does not allege that Restrepo was a member of the
cartel, and Mermelstein said he did not know Restrepo, a businesman
in the Colombian town of Medellin who is accused of running a
large-scale money-laundering operation for cartel members.
   Restrepo was arrested in June 1987 as a result of an FBI
``sting'' in Greenwich. He was accused of laundering more than $10
million through a front corporation set up by undercover agents.
   His attorney claims he was engaged in legitimate currency
exchange.
   To prove the crime of money-laundering, prosecutors must show
that Restrepo knew the source of the money and that it represented
the proceeds of unlawful acts, and that he exchanged the money in an
attempt to carry on the unlawful activity or to conceal its origin.
   Mermelstein, who ran his drug operation out of Miami, pleaded
guilty in April 1986 in Los Angeles to cocaine conspiracy and
possession charges. He was sentenced last year to the two years he
had already served in prison following his arrest, and given
``lifetime special parole.''
   Twardy said outside the court that Mermelstein was accepted into
the federal witness protection program.
   Mermelstein told the jury that he became involved in cocaine
trafficking in 1978 when he began working with a man associated with
the cartel. Mermelstein estimated that he helped arrange the
shipment and distribution of about 56 tons of cocaine.
   He said his role included dispatching pilots to bring the cocaine
into the United States, distributing the cocaine and transferring
the payments to his bosses.
   Mermelstein said he personally was responsible for collecting and
transferring about $300 million in drug proceeds.
   About three-quarters of the cash was flown back to Colombia,
while the rest was either turned over to money launderers'
representatives or hidden in articles shipped to the South American
country, he testified.
   Mermelstein said he attended a ``good number'' of cartel
meetings, but made only one trip to Medellin, in 1984, to attend a
party he said was thrown by a cartel member. All the meetings were
designed ``to see how more and more cocaine could be brought into
the U.S.,'' he said.
   Mermelstein identified the pictures of seven Colombians,
including that of Pablo Escobar. In a recorded discussion with
undercover agents, Restrepo identified Escobar as the source of much
of his money and one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the
Colombian city of Medellin.

   A chipmunk or squirrel are top suspects
in the mysterious dog-food cache that an auto mechanic blamed for a
customer's clogged air filter.
   John Colling said that a few hours after he dropped his car off
for heater repairs, his mechanic called him.
   ``Do you have a dog?'' he quoted the puzzled mechanic as asking.
Colling said he did, and that he bought 25-pound bags of dry food
for his pet.
   ``Well, there's two or three pounds of the stuff in your
engine,'' the mechanic told him Thursday.
   Colling, 25, communications director at GMI Engineering &
Management Institute, was surprised. Neighborhood dogs hadn't been
tailing his car, and it hadn't had engine trouble.
   ``In fact, it's running doggone good,'' quipped Colling, who
guessed that the chow was squirreled away by an animal that raided
dog-food bags stored in the garage.
   He said he'll keep the food in a covered can from now on.

   It's still Halloween on the Pennsylvania
Turnpike, with state troopers dressing up in costumes and going into
hiding.
   But unsuspecting motorists shouldn't expect a treat from these
belated Halloweeners, who are out to issue speeding tickets, not
collect candy.
   Capt. Russell Clanagan, commander of the troop in charge of
policing the 470-mile highway, gave the order for the 217-member
Troop T ``to be innovative and creative'' in choosing places to hide.
   In the month the program has been in use, troopers have dressed
as road maintenance workers and sat in state Department of
Transportation trucks. In at least one case, they watched from a
construction shed. Radar guns may be aimed from behind a tree or
other hiding spot.
   ``We don't want to rule out anything,'' Clanagan said Tuesday.
``We want people to know that we're going to be out there making
every effort to enforce the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit.''
   Although the exact number of speeding tickets issued has not been
compiled, Clanagan said that ``from the word that I've gotten, the
results are just astronomical, more than we envisioned, way and
above what we initially felt they would be.''
   The practice has been in use in Maryland for years and is used in
Delaware, Clanagan said.

<HEAD>Too-Popular Cape Cod Hit With `Burn The Bridge' Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a century, people have flocked to Cape Cod and
its nearby islands with retirement dreams and tourist dollars, but
many residents of the sandy peninsula are growing increasingly wary
_ and weary _ of outsiders.
   ``The Cape Cod that I grew up in is almost extinct,'' said Ruth
Rusher, the third generation of her family to make her home on the
Cape.
   Mrs. Rusher, 78, who lives in a house in Hyannis that was built
when she was born, feels it's almost too late to save the Cape's
relaxed and quiet past as shopping centers and fast-food joints
spring up like mushrooms.
   Some call the opposition to development a ``burn-the-bridge''
syndrome, a reference to the two spans over the Cape Cod Canal that
connect the 65-mile stretch of beach to the Massachusetts mainland.
   Among the signs of discontent: Voters next week will face two
ballot questions to limit development; residents of Nantucket and
Martha's Vineyard are fighting to curb ferry traffic to those
islands; and a case to ban recreational vehicles from the beaches
was scheduled to go to federal court today.
   ``The bottom line is awareness of the limits, and the ability to
recognize when enough is enough,'' said Susan Nickerson, executive
director of the Association for the Preservation of Cape Cod.
   The 4,000-member group is behind the two non-binding ballot
resolutions that would halt new construction until a Cape-wide
regulating agency can be established to control growth.
   The population of Cape Cod has swelled 540 percent during the
past 60 years while the rest of the state has grown just 50 percent,
Ms. Nickerson said. Year-round residents number about 173,000, a
figure that more than triples in the summertime, according to the
Barnstable County Economic Planning Commission.
   Despite these figures, members of the Cape real estate industry
are wary of the effort to stop growth, even temporarily, though they
agree with the principle, said Nancy Harrison, vice president of the
Cape Cod Home Builders Association.
   ``The home builders' point of view is you don't have to stop
growth to put controls on the way building takes place. There are
(zoning) controls already,'' said Ms. Harrison. She said her group's
250 firms worry about what could happen at the end of a moratorium.
   Last week, the Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket
Steamship Authority, a state agency, rejected an application from a
ferry operator to run a high-speed catamaran service linking Boston
with Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard.
   The would-be operator argued the service would ease the
horrendous summertime traffic jams on Cape Cod by allowing visitors
and residents to travel by boat directly from Boston to the two
islands, rather than by car to the Cape and then to the islands via
ferry.
   Lyn Zimmerman of Nantucket, who organized residents to oppose the
catamarans, said the authority's refusal to permit such service was
an important step toward helping her island cope with growing crowds
of summer visitors.
   State Sen. William Q. MacLean Jr. disagreed, even though he owns
a home on Nantucket. In fact, he said, it's because he could only
finally afford that home in 1980 that he wants others to have access
to the island's unspoiled, turn-of-the century charm.
   McLean called the opposition to the new boat service selfish.
   ``It's the old attitude: `I have something that you don't have
and you're not going to have it,''' said MacLean, who filed a bill
Monday that would strip the steamship authority of its power to
license ferry operators.
   Replied Ms. Zimmerman: ``I don't think that people in other parts
of the state that Senator MacLean represents realize how difficult
it is for a community like ours to provide services.''
   Meanwhile, conservationists are fighting an attempt by the
Interior Department to ease National Park Service restrictions on
the use of off-road vehicles at the Cape Cod National Seashore, a
strip of pristine beach and brush that lines about half of the
Cape's length.
   The new regulations would allow dune buggies to scoot along the
protected shore, but not in the dunes or wetlands.
   The federal appeals court in Boston was scheduled to hear
arguments today in a lawsuit brought by the Boston-based
Conservation Law Foundation.

   Actress Sigourney Weaver is building a

   The rustic three-story custom timber peg home is situated on 417
acres on the northern end of Long Lake, a 5{-hour drive from New
York City, where the actress lives with her husband, director James
Simpson.
   The actress paid $140,000 for the property in 1986, according to
the Watertown Daily Times.
   Katherine Olin, the agent for the star of the current movie

   ``I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't publish this,''
Olin said, ``if we could avoid this invasion of privacy.''

   A man with an 18-year criminal record
has been sentenced to life in prison for an armed robbery in which
$3 was taken.
   William Roldan, 35, of Springfield, also was sentenced Monday by
Hampden Superior Court Judge Raymond Cross to concurrent eight- to
10-year sentences on five burglary charges and concurrent three- to
five-year sentences on four counts of larceny. He pleaded guilty to
all of the charges.
   In a plea for mercy, defense attorney Timothy Mannion blamed
Roldan's criminal activities on drug addiction and alcoholism. He
also contended the victim of the $3 heist ``was herself a junkie who
is now doing time.''
   But Assistant District Attorney Terrence Dunphy urged the life
term, arguing Roldan's criminal record was ``a continuous entry from
the time he became an adult'' and ``continues unabated except for
the times Mr. Roldan has been incarcerated.''
   Roldan will be eligible for parole in 15 years, according to
Dunphy.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Wednesday,
while share prices inched down on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.68 yen, down 0.62 yen from Tuesday's
close of 125.30 yen. Opening at 124.82 yen, the currency moved in a
range of 124.40 yen to 124.85 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 31.13-point
winner the previous day, lost 28.41 points, to fall back to
27,985.26.
   Athough the index gained 60.33 points shortly after the market
opened, it gradually fell afterwards.
   The dollar closed at the 124-yen level for the first time since
June 10, when it finished trading at 124.85 yen.
   The Bank of Japan intervened in the market since shortly after
trading began Wednesday to save the dollar from declining further, a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said, speaking anonymously.
   Traders said the central bank bought small amounts of dollars
intermittently as the U.S. currency continued to fall despite the
reported action. But the Bank of Japan refused comment on its
monetary actions.
   On the stock exchange, share prices moved little due to
profit-taking after a week of consecutive gains, dealers said.
   But participants were still interested in buying a variety of
issues, which made trading active, they said.

   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said after the deadline

   The Washington Post today said it would not
endorse either major party candidate for president, calling this
year's race a ``terrible campaign, a national disappointment.''
   In a long editorial entitled ``No Endorsement,'' the newspaper's
editors said ``we would have liked'' to support Democrat Michael
Dukakis but were especially alarmed at his deficiencies in foreign
affairs and defense.
   The editorial said Republican George Bush made himself too
beholden to the far right of the party and he is ``really the major
source and cause of the tawdriness of this campaign.''
   Mentioning Bush's controversial choice of a running mate, it said
``the prospect of Dan Quayle's suddenly having to succeed him in
office will remain a legitimate anxiety.''
   ``This has been a terrible campaign, a national disappointment,''
the newspaper said. ``For our part ... we do not feel that the we
can in good faith argue for the vindication of the cheap shots that
have animated George Bush's campaign ... or close our eyes to
alarming deficiencies of the Democratic candidate as a prospective
president.''

<HEAD>Students Elect Bush Overwhelmingly In Mock Presidential Election</HEAD>

   Michael Dukakis beat George Bush in his
hometown, but it was all downhill from there in a mock election that
might make some Dukakis boosters happy the torch hasn't yet been
passed to a new generation.
   High school students nationwide Tuesday chose Vice President Bush
for president by a 2-1 margin, prompting observations that the tally
is a clear signal the Old Guard has overtaken the New Frontier among
the nation's youth.
   ``One person put it rather succinctly: The young people have
grown up under the Reagan administration and they are rather
complacent,'' said Kim Robert Nilsen, a spokesman for the Northfield
Mount Hermon School.
   ``Issues do not tend to surface and be debated in any great
fashion,'' Nilsen said. ``With no burning issues, there's probably
no real reason to contemplate going in another direction.''
   Northfield, a private, 1,160-student school in northwestern
Massachusetts, coordinated what it called the first nationwide
presidential election run by high school students.
   Casting ballots a week before the real election were
ninth-through 12th-graders at two schools in every state, from
25-student Weiser High in Idaho to 1,900-student Brookline High in
Massachusetts, the alma mater of Dukakis, the state's Democratic
governor.
   In early returns, Bush, the Republican candidate, received 24,758
popular votes and 315 electoral votes, while Dukakis won 12,682
popular votes and 73 electoral votes, said Nilsen.
   The only states won by Dukakis were Massachusetts, Minnesota,
South Dakota, Colorado and Arkansas, plus the District of Columbia,
said Nilsen, who added that votes had not yet been received from
Vermont and Michigan. New York and Missouri were hard-fought losses
for the Dukakis camp.
   Alternative party candidates received a scattering of votes, with
National Alliance Party candidate Lenora Fuliani winning 1,085,
Libertarian Party candidate Ron Paul taking 514 and Consumer Party
candidate Eugene McCarthy winning 161, Nilsen said.
   In Dukakis' hometown of Brookline, the Democrat received 1,008
votes to 289 for Bush. In Northfield, where all the results were
phoned in, Dukakis took 518 votes while Bush won 207.
   Nilsen said he was very encouraged by the total student turnout,
which he said was a 71 percent response at the schools with a total
enrollment of 75,000 students.
   ``That's really heartening. ... I think we're going to be in good
hands some time in the future,'' he said.
   He said the mock election was designed as a civics lesson for
students who will be old enough to make their votes count in the
real event in 1992.
   In a room he called ``Election Central,'' students manned five
phone lines, taking the tallies and running them upstairs to a staff
member at the controls of an election computer that tabulated the
popular vote and the electoral college winner.
   ``We know mock elections are held in schools all over the United
States, but they've never been tied together before,'' Nilsen said.
   Some of the 150 Northfield Mount Hermon students who volunteered
to work on the project operated a mock television anchor booth,
posted results on a huge map of the United States and hung bunting
and balloons.
   The election, which cost $6,000, was financed by $50 fees from
each school and donations ranging up to $500 from alumni of
Northfield Mount Hermon.
   American history teacher James Shea said organizers sent notice
of the election to schools on the 1987 Exemplary Schools list
compiled by the U.S. Department of Education. Some 270 schools asked
to take part in the election.
   The organizers chose 54 private schools and 46 public schools _
roughly one of each from each state and the District of Columbia _
on a first-come basis.
   Shea said one school in Anchorage responded to the notice by
protesting that the mock election might influence the real one.
``Naturally, we were flattered someone would think that,'' he said.

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush had
double-digit leads in two national surveys released a week before
the election, but neither survey showed a marked shift from last
week's results.
   An ABC News-Washington Post survey of 1,099 probable voters gave
Bush a 13-point lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis, 55-42.
   Although it was the largest lead for Bush in the survey, the
results were not significantly different from last week's 52 percent
to 44 percent lead for Bush. The poll was conducted last Wednesday
through Monday and had a margin of error of plus or minus four
percentage points.
   A CBS News poll of 1,065 probable voters gave Bush a 12-point
lead, 53-41, not significantly different from last week's 54-41
margin. The new poll was conducted Saturday through Monday and had a
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   There were signs of movement or potential movement in the CBS
poll. One-seventh of the voters said they had decided in the past
two weeks, and 22 percent indicated they could change their minds.
Another 6 percent hadn't decided yet.
   In the ABC-Washington Post survey, Bush was found to have closed
the gender gap, leading among women 53-44. But the poll also found
his strongest support among independents _ about a third of likely
voters _ whites and men.
   A 57 percent majority thought George Bush was running a dirty
campaign, although a large number said they were voting for him
anyway. Among Democrats, 64 percent said Dukakis was not the best
possible candidate for the party, and 60 percent said the Democrats
need to change how they pick their candidate.
   Bush was seen as better able to handle the economy, 52 percent to
40 percent, and was viewed as stronger on crime and defense.
Dukakis's favorable ratings have slipped in the last two weeks: Only
42 percent see Dukakis as a strong leader now, compared with more
than half previously; 47 percent said he has good judgment, compared
with 55 percent two weeks ago.
   In its poll, CBS sought to measure the source of the opinions on
who would prevail. An overwhelming majority, 70 percent, said they
thought Bush would win the election, while just 12 percent said they
thought Dukakis would win. The remainder said they didn't know.
   A plurality, 38 percent, said their expectation was based chiefly
on what they had heard from the candidates; 22 percent said it was
based on the polls; and 12 percent said their view was guided by
opinions expressed in the media.
   As in other recent surveys, Dukakis continued to suffer from a
high negative rating in the CBS poll: Forty-one percent had an
unfavorable opinion of him; 33 percent, favorable. Bush, by
contrast, was rated favorably by 46 percent to 33 percent. In both
cases the rest were undecided or had no opinion.
   Bush has held a healthy lead over Dukakis in other recent polls,
enjoying a slightly lower seven-point advantage, 52-45, in a Harris
poll done Friday through Sunday, and 11 points, 52-41, in a Gallup
poll last week.
   In some state polls:
   _ Dukakis was leading Bush by seven points, 49-42, in
Massachusetts, according to a survey of 400 likely voters conducted
Saturday and Sunday. The margin of error was plus or minus five
points. The survey was conducted for the Boston Herald and WBZ-TV.
   _ In Colorado, Bush's lead over Dukakis shrank from 19 points a
few days ago to 13 points, 52-39, according to a Denver Post-News 4
survey of 450 people last Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The survey
had a five-point margin of error.
   _ Bush and Dukakis were tied in Pennsylvania, 46 points each,
according to a weekend survey of 792 registered voters by the
Philadelphia Daily News and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The margin of
error was nearly four points.
   _ Dukakis was leading Bush 43-39 in a Michigan survey of 400
registered voters conducted Saturday and Sunday. The poll by
Nordhaus Research of Southfield, Mich., had a margin of error of
five percentage points.
   _ Bush was leading Dukakis in traditionally-Democratic Maryland
by six points, 47-41 percent, in a statewide poll of 477 registered
voters by the University of Maryland. The survey conducted Oct. 21
through Oct. 31 had a margin of error of five percentage points in
either direction.

   An army of volunteers like the one that helped put
a damper on Devil's Night arson fires last weekend may be deployed
one day to combat crack houses and youth gunfights, says Mayor
Coleman A. Young.
   ``Anytime an aroused community comes together to deal with a
problem, that problem can be resolved,'' Young said Tuesday. ``What
you've seen is a resolution of the Devil's Night problem.''
   About 20,000 civilians joined police and firefighters in
patrolling the streets, keeping Detroit's annual Halloween weekend
fire outbreak well below last year's level and near the city's
normal rate, Young said.
   From Saturday through Monday 229 fires broke out, a drop of 21
percent from last year, the mayor said. Devil's Night is the night
before Halloween.
   On Saturday, a below-average number of 56 fires broke out, and
Monday's 69 blazes were typical for any night of the year in the
city, Young said. Officials reported 104 fires Sunday.
   ``This was the quietest Devil's Night in years,'' he said. ``The
youngsters are beginning to get the message.
   ``There were a lot of pyromaniacs who were attracted to
Detroit,'' Young said. ``It's good to see these people have lost
interest. They're going elsewhere for their kicks.''
   Young invited community leaders to City Hall, and praised the
volunteers. He said the city may organize similar volunteer efforts
to fight crack houses and the use of handguns by youths.
   ``Almost anything we try to do together we can do,'' he said. ``I
think this shows that.''
   Young said the city won't relax its anti-arson effort or a
dusk-to-dawn weekend curfew next year.
   ``We cannot afford to stand idle and assume we've won the war. We
need to keep the heat on,'' he said.
   Police detained 452 youths who defied the 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew,
he said. Eight people were arrested on arson charges.
   Despite the crackdown, Devil's Night flames left three families
homeless.
   The number of fires has dropped steadily since 1984, when the
annual tradition sparked 810 blazes, killing one person and leaving
dozens of others homeless.

<HEAD>Elections Leave Likud, Labor Courting Religious Parties For Support</HEAD>

   The right-wing Likud bloc and rival left-leaning
Labor Party, deadlocked in parliamentary elections, today courted
Israel's four religious parties in a bid to form a coalition
government.
   Likud had the early edge because it won the most votes in
Tuesday's balloting and is ideologically more compatible with the
small religious parties that now hold the balance of power.
   ``Based on the facts we have before us, it seems that the
situation commands and enables the Likud to form Israel's next
government,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who heads Likud, told
supporters at campaign headquarters during a nationally televised
speech early today.
   With 99 percent of the 4,840 polling stations reporting, Likud
had 39 seats in the 120-member Knesset, or parliament, Labor had 38
and the religious parties 18. Three of Labor's left-wing allies won
10 seats, three rightist Likud allies seven seats, and three
Arab-oriented lists took eight seats.
   Sixty-one seats are needed to govern, but because neither major
party has ever won an absolute majority, small parties have
influence beyond their numbers. Like this year, the 1984 elections
ended in deadlock, with Labor winning 44 seats and Likud 41.
   This election is seen as crucial in determining the future of the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and setting policy toward Israel's
Arab enemies.
   A protracted Palestinian insurrection that began Dec. 8 in the
occupied lands has claimed the lives of at least 304 Palestinians
and 10 Israelis. On Sunday, a firebomb attack in the West Bank
killed a Jewish woman and her three sons.
   Several religious party leaders said they were not yet ready to
commit themselves to either Labor or the Likud, which means unity in
Hebrew. Complex negotiations over portfolios and policy could drag
on for weeks.
   Labor, headed by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, advocates an
international Middle East peace conference and trading some land for
peace. Likud opposes both. It calls for direct talks with Israel's
Arab neighbors and limited self-rule for Palestinians.
   Shamir, 73, rejected allegations from the leftist camp that a
Likud-led government would heighten chances of war. He said as prime
minister he would make ``every effort to reach peace with our Arab
neighbors as quickly as possible.''
   Benny Begin, son of Likud founder and former Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, claimed Labor's peace plan was dead. ``There will be
no international conference and parts of eastern Israel (the West
Bank) will not be handed over to a foreign power,'' he said on
Israel radio.
   Peres, meanwhile, said Labor was still a contender and would seek
to woo the religious parties. ``I reject Likud's attempt to annex
the religious vote,'' he told supporters.
   ``I would not say that all religious people are necessarily
right-wing,'' Peres, 65, later told Israel radio. ``We shall hear
what they propose and if they all want the same thing.''
   Both Labor and Likud scheduled meetings today with the religious
parties. The religious bloc, which grew from 14 to 18 seats,
consists of the National Religious Party and three ultra-Orthodox
groups _ Shas, Agudat Israel and Torah Flag.
   The National Religious Party opposes territorial compromise, but
the other three parties are more ambiguous on the peace issue and
have not ruled out a coalition with Labor.
   The religious parties will be able to exact a high price from
either coalition partner. For example, both Shas and the National
Religious Party immediately demanded three Cabinet posts, Israeli
radio said.
   Shamir indicated all issues on the religious agenda are up for
grabs, including the key demand that only those converted to Judaism
by an Orthodox rabbi should be considered Jewish. Such a move could
alienate American Jews, most of whom belong to the Reform and
Conservative branches of Judaism.
   ``No issues are taboo,'' Shamir told Israel radio.
   Three new parties entered Parliament, including Moledet, or
Homeland, which advocates the ouster from the occupied lands of the
1.5 million Palestinians who live there. Likud needs the Moledet's
support to form a rightist-religious coalition, but Begin said
Moledet's platform would never be adopted as government policy.
   About 79 percent of Israel's 2.9 million eligible voters went to
polls Tuesday; 13,000 police and civil guards protected the polling
sites. The army sealed off the occupied territories where a general
strike entered its second day today.

   A man who tried to stage a fake Halloween
hanging in a tavern but wound up choking to death in front of
unsuspecting patrons ``had a stupid look on his face like he was
kidding around,'' a witness says.
   Milton ``Michael'' Tyree, 41, died Monday night when a harness
he'd rigged to simulate a hanging at the Cantab Lounge slipped,
choking him, said police Detective James Dwyer.
   When he walked into the bar, Tyree had his face painted white,
was wearing a black hood and carried a sickle ``like the Grim
Reaper,'' said witness Mike Dorman.
   ``He came in and stood up on a chair and hitched himself to a
beam,'' Dorman said. ``Somebody just pulled the chair out. He didn't
look uncomfortable at all. He was moving his arms and everything. He
always had a stupid look on his face like he was kidding around.''
   Dwyer said: ``The harness slipped and he really was hanging, but
it took the crowd a while to realize what was happening. ... When
our officers arrived, he was down _ someone had cut him down _ but
it was too late.''
   Tyree was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, where doctors
spent the night trying to revive him. He was pronounced dead Tuesday
morning, said hospital spokesman Martin Bander.
   Police said 60 to 70 people were in the bar during the hanging,
but bar owner Richard Fitzgerald said he believed there were only 15
or 20.
   Fitzgerald said he stopped Tyree from performing the parlor trick
earlier Monday evening.
   ``He came in dressed in a Halloween costume _ he looked like some
kind of a creature, I don't know what he was supposed to be _ and he
had a noose round his neck with about a six-inch rope,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``He had this harness around his body, a kind of nylon net,
which he lifted up his costume and showed me.
   ``The next thing I knew,'' Fitzgerald recalled, ``I was sitting
in the corner watching the ball game, and a waitress said to me, `Do
you see what's going on over there?'''
   Fitzgerald said he turned around and saw Tyree standing on a
chair at the back of the bar, attaching the rope to a wooden beam
across the ceiling.
   ``I said to him, `What do you think you're doing?' and he said,
`Don't worry about me, I've done this lots of times before.' I said,
`Well, you're not doing it in here!'''
   Tyree then left the bar. But he returned an hour later, after
Fitzgerald had gone home for the night, to try the stunt again.
   The second time, it proved fatal.

   Four tiny religious parties were the surprise
winners in Israel's election, securing enough votes to tip the
scales of power and determine who heads the next coalition
government.
   Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox parties won 18 seats Tuesday in the
120-member parliament, an increase of four seats from 1984.
   Analysts were surprised by the outcome, which had not registered
in pre-election polls. It was seen as a reflection of the religious
community's demographic growth and a trend toward greater political
involvement.
   The religious parties now have a great deal of bargaining power
because neither the right-wing Likud bloc with its 39 seats nor the
left-of-center Labor Party with 38 can form a coalition alone.
   ``We have been invited both by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
by Shimon Peres,'' said Avner Shaki, referring to Likud and Labor
leaders requests to negotiate with his National Religious Party.
``We will ask for the fulfilment of demands as we see fit.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor said: ``The religious
parties hold the key to (determining) which party will put a
government together.''
   But while the religious parties have not ruled out joining a
Labor-led coalition, they would make strange bedfellows with Labor's
traditional allies, the socialist Mapam party and the leftist
Citizens Rights Movement, which takes a strong stand against
religious coercion.
   ``We will, with the help of God, first and foremost improve the
quality of life for the ultra-Orthodox community,'' said Avraham
Ravitz, leader of the new religious party Torah Flag, which won two
seats in the Knesset, or parliament. At the top of the Orthodox
agenda is a controversial demand to revise Israel's Law of Return,
which grants automatic citizenship to all Jews. The Orthodox want
Israel to recognize as Jewish only those born to a Jewish mother or
converted by an Orthodox rabbi.
   A change in the law would alienate large numbers of Jews who live
in the United States and elsewhere abroad, where Orthodoxy is on the
decline and interfaith marriages abound.
   The religious parties also want to see abortions outlawed and
commercial activity banned on the Jewish Sabbath. With the exception
of the National Religious Party, most religious parties favor
continued exemptions from army service for seminary students, a
cause for resentment among secular Israelis.
   ``There can be no security without the help of God. Without God's
hand guiding the triggers of our soldiers, there never was any
success and can be no success,'' said Rabbi Moshe Zeev Feldman, head
of the Agudat Israel party.
   Positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict are ambiguous. While the
Orthodox parties have a religious attachment to the occupied West
Bank because of historic biblical ties, they tend to shy away from
taking a strong political line on the areas.
   Only the National Religious Party, which has a more nationalistic
line than the others, takes a firm stand against territorial
compromise.
   The Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip was the primary issue in the campaign. The nearly
11-month-old revolt has claimed the lives of more than 300 Arabs and
10 Israelis.
   The NRP, which won four seats in 1984, gained one seat Tuesday.
Shas, dedicated to preserving the traditions of Jews from Arab
countries and North Africa, won six seats compared to last term's
four.
   Agudat Israel, representing observant European-born Jews,
increased its seats from two to five. Torah Flag is an Agudat Israel
offshoot.
   Even though the four parties had a net gain of six seats, the
increase in the religious bloc was only four seats, from 14 to 18,
because two tiny religious factions merged with other parties.

<HEAD>$50 Million Verdict Against Chemical Company Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court ruled that a
chemical company was responsible for poisoning residents with toxic
emissions, but said a trial judge was correct in throwing out a $50
million damage award against the plant.
   The Missouri Court of Appeals agreed Tuesday that Alcolac Inc.
had been ``reckless and utterly indifferent,'' but said it was
forced to dismiss the verdict because each of the 31 plaintiffs was
not considered separately.
   The court ordered new trials to decide how much each person's
health was affected by the 10-year-old plant in rural Sedalia, and
how much each should be awarded in actual and punitive damages.
   The judges also cited errors at the original trial, including
``notorious and inflammatory statements that damage to clients'
immune systems amounted to a type of chemically induced AIDS.''
   The company, which produces chemicals used in making paints and
plastics, contended at the 1985 trial that people living near the
plant were already sick when it began operations or the ills they
suffered were because they were old.
   But experts testified that people surrounding the plant were
likely to contract cancer and would have a shortened life span
because of the plant. The plaintiffs testified about burning eyes
and nasal and throat problems that began when the plant opened.
   Two of the original 31 plaintiffs have died. One committed
suicide, a death that his wife blamed on depression caused by the
plant, which was within view of his front porch.
   Joyce Sommers, one of the plaintiffs, said she was resigned to
more lengthy trial proceedings before the matter is settled.
   ``I guess we aren't going to have much choice but to have another
trial if we want to win the case,'' she said. ``I'm not happy about
it and I know the other people won't be happy either.''
   Alcolac maintains that no evidence proves emissions from the
plant were responsible for illnesses suffered by the plaintiffs, who
are members of 13 families. Alvin D. Shapiro, an attorney for the
company, said he was still studying the latest decision and declined
comment.
   Lantz Welch, who represented the plaintiffs, said the appeals
court ruling was ``one of the options.''
   Welch had told the appeals court that problems in the plant were
``factually amazing.'' He cited balls of chemical foam the size of
pickup trucks floating across the countryside, orchards and poultry
flocks decimated by fumes and toxic waste burned under cover of
darkness.
   Jackson County Circuit Judge Thomas J. Helms had ruled that the
jury violated constitutional guidelines by awarding identical
damages of $200,000 in actual damages and $1.4 million in punitive
damages to each plaintiff.
   The appeals court, however, said it did not agree that
constitutional guidelines had been broken.
   The court ordered a new trial be held to decide punitive damages,
and a series of trials or a consolidated trial be held to determine
actual damages for each plaintiff.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen Despite Intervention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell today against the Japanese yen
despite the intervention of the nation's central bank, while share
prices inched down on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.68 yen, down 0.62 yen from Tuesday's
close of 125.30 yen. The currency opened at 124.82 yen and even
though the Bank of Japan began buying dollars, it fell lower and
ranged between 124.40-124.85 yen.
   It was the third straight day the Bank of Japan intervened in the
market in an effort to keep the dollar from declining, said Takamasa
Yamasaki of the Daiwa Bank.
   He said the move and a similar intervention in the United States
has not worked ``because market players are thinking the banks' move
was just one of the temporary political tactics ahead of the U.S.
presidential election'' on Nov. 8.
   ``Unless the weaker dollar makes investors worry about negative
effects to the Japanese economy, the current trend is likely to
continue,'' Yamasaki said.
   On the stock exchange market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
lost 28.41 points, or 0.1 percent, closing at 27,985.26. The index
gained 60.33 points shortly after the market opened, then gradually
declined.
   ``Share prices fell because some investors sold issues for
profit-taking'' following seven straight days of market gains that
ended Tuesday, said an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's
largest brokerage.

<HEAD>Book Reveals Less-Serious Side Of Carl Sandburg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Sandburg may be remembered as the
author of such serious works as his biography of Lincoln, but a new
book may put the prairie bard in a different light.
   Called ``Fables, Foibles and Foobles,'' the book of prose by
Sandburg shows a silly side to the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer.
   George Hendrick, an English professor at the University of
Illinois, said the stories were stored with other Sandburg papers in
an Asheville, N.C., bank vault after his death in 1967.
   After Sandburg's oldest daughter, Margaret, introduced Hendrick
to the material in 1982, he proposed to put them into a book.
   Here's an example:
   ``A fly, a flea and a flick talked about books and reading.
   ``The fly said he always counted the pages first to see whether
there were too many or not enough.
   ``The flea said he always ran through the book first and marked
the pages to skip.
   ``The flick said, `I always begin reading a book wherever I open
it.' Then yawning, `And the farther back the better.'''
   Sandburg is mostly identified with the biography of Lincoln,
which won him a Pulitzer, and ``Chicago,'' the stirring poem that
gave the town its moniker ``City of Big Shoulders.''
   ``What people tend to forget is he always had an outrageous sense
of humor,'' Hendrick said Tuesday.
   ``Sandburg wrote these fables over a long period of time,'' he
said. ``Some were written when his family was in Chicago, some in
Michigan and some in North Carolina. He probably had in mind to tell
them to his grandchildren.''
   Like a troubadour, Sandburg enjoyed traveling between towns to
deliver public readings and lectures. After the crowds had gone
home, he would hold private readings for friends and bring out the
funny verse.
   ``He clearly was having fun with the sound of words,'' Hendrick
said, ``and the whole idea that was going around in the 1930s and
'40s, a real serious one, about how to read a book. Sandburg made it
into a comedy.''
   ``Fables, Foibles and Foobles,'' published in September by the
University of Illinois Press, deals with critics, the subject of
reading, politics and ``just fun,'' the professor said.
   Why did Sandburg fail to publish these works when he was alive?
   ``That is, of course, a great mystery,'' Hendrick said. ``Clearly
it wasn't material that would embarrass anyone; it's funny. I think
Sandburg saw this material as work for his private hours.''

<HEAD>Neighbors Displaced by New Stadium Get New Lots In Lottery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ping-pong balls bobbled around, then out
popped the one telling Dessie Singleton where she will live after
the home she has lived in for 35 years is destroyed.
   Ms. Singleton was among 19 families who took part in a unique
lottery Tuesday night _ one that would determine who would get which
lot when an entire neighborhood is relocated to make way for the new
Chicago White Sox stadium.
   ``I hate to move, but since I've got to move, I guess they're
giving us a fair deal,'' Ms. Singleton said as she followed the
bouncing balls.
   When the American League baseball team decided on a new home
across the street from 78-year-old Comiskey Park, residents of the
neighborhood protested that their close-knit community would be torn
apart.
   So officials building the $150 million ballpark agreed to move
the resident homeowners as a group into a new neighborhood of their
choice. Those who didn't want to were given fair-market value for
their homes plus $25,000.
   ``How do you go in and give one lot to one person and another lot
to another person?'' asked Georgia Petropoulos, project manager for
the Rescorp Deveopment Co., which is overseeing the $10 million
relocation. ``I think everyone realizes (a lottery) is the fairest
way to do it.''
   The City Council and the city's Landmark Commission still must
approve the cost of the sites and plans for the homes.
   While most residents agreed the lottery was fair, they were not
as impressed with the fairness of the move itself.
   ``It is not our choice _ it's our second choice,'' said Susie
Myers, who lives with her sister and 95-year-old father. ``This has
been home to me for 46 years. It's not my decision to move, so it
does not make me happy.''
   And most of them didn't have much of a preference as to which lot
they were assigned. So while they enjoyed seeing their old friends
at the lottery in a school cafeteria, nobody really felt they lost
more than the next person.
   ``Actually it didn't matter to me,'' said eight-year resident
Mary Marshall. ``I'm just glad it's over with.''
   The neighbors will be moved from their primarily blue-collar
neighborhood across the Dan Ryan Expressway to a redeveloping
middle-income neighborhood called the Gap. Because their new homes
will not be ready until the end of summer, they will move first to
temporary housing when they leave their old homes in January.
   Some residents of the Gap fear the new homes will not fit into
the historic district that includes several houses designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright. They have objected to the design plans, complaining
the new homes would be made of a plaster substitute instead of stone.
   ``We're clearly helping the community in that 19 vacant lots will
have 19 new homes on them,'' countered Peter Bynoe, director of the
Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which is building the stadium.
``Other issues in terms of the economic stability of the new
residents are unfounded.''
   But when the White Sox move into their new ballpark in 1991, they
may find they've lost some friends as well as neighbors.
   ``At one time I was a Sox fan, but not anymore,'' said Ms. Myers.

<TEXT>
   A black free-lance journalist
has been sentenced to four years in prison for failing to report the
whereabouts of two suspected African National Congress guerrillas.
   Themba Khumalo, 31, freelanced for several Western news
organizations at the time of his arrest in June 1987. He was
sentenced Tuesday in Johnnesburg Magistrates Court to two concurrent
four-year terms.
   According to testimony, Khumalo was approached in early 1987 by
Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and asked
to help find accommodation for youths fleeing to the Johannesburg
area from political unrest in Natal Province.
   The charges against Khumalo concerned two young men whom he
subsequently aided. One purportedly confided to Khumalo that he was
an ANC guerrilla, while the other purportedly was seen by the
journalist handling a firearm.
   In mitigation, defense lawyers argued that Khumalo's career and
possibly his life could have been in jeopardy if he had become known
as an informer.

<HEAD>New York Post To Launch Sunday Edition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Post says it will intensify New
York's heated newspaper competition by launching a Sunday edition.
   The owner of the spirited morning tabloid that came close to
extinction earlier this year said Tuesday he wants to compete seven
days a week with The New York Times, the Daily News and Newsday.
   The Sunday edition, complete with color comics and a magazine
supplement, is scheduled to make its debut March 5 and sell for $1.
   The decision for the project came after ``repeated requests and
offers of support from our major advertisers and dealers,'' Post
owner Peter S. Kalikow said.
   The millionaire real estate developer also predicted that the
Post, after years of losses, would show a profit next year.
   Current losses are ``a minor fraction'' of the ``$650,000 a week
when we bought the paper last March'' from Rupert Murdoch, he said
at a news conference. He declined to provide specific numbers.
   Kalikow said he would invest $25 million in the Sunday edition
and increase the paper's staff by about 60, including 30 reporters
and editors.
   An initial press run of 500,000 copies was expected, he said.
   Newspaper analyst John Morton called it a ``bold move, but one I
think they had to make if they want to make the Post a viable
enterprise.''
   ``In successful newspapers _ which the Post is not _ Sunday
papers account for 40 to 50 percent of revenue,'' he said. The
danger is that advertisers won't increase their Post advertising
budgets, but spread them thinner to cover an additional day, he said.
   However, Eric Philo, an analyst for the investment firm Goldman,
Sachs, said he didn't see a place for another Sunday paper in New
York and predicted it only would increase the financial drain on the
Post.
   Union reaction was favorable.
   ``I get the impression that (Kalikow's) here to stay over the
long haul,'' said Tom Pennacchio, secretary treasurer of the
Newspaper Guild, which represents the Post's editorial staff.
   Pennacchio said he earlier joined others in believing Kalikow was
more interested in the Post's valuable lower Manhattan property than
the paper itself.
   The Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, was on the verge of ceasing publication when Kalikow and
Murdoch negotiated major concessions and buyouts from the paper's
unions.
   Since then, Kalikow said, ``Both the financial as well as the
editorial aspects of the paper have improved far beyond our
expectations, and therefore we've moved up the Sunday publication
from a date some time in our original plans of 1991 to 1989.''

<TEXT>
   Documents dating to the dawn of the republic led
a federal appeals court to reject an Indian tribe's claim to 5{
million acres of land in New York state.
   The decision Tuesday upheld a lower court ruling against the
Oneida Indian nation, which claims it has a right to land stretching
from Canada to Pennsylvania.
   The Oneidas, joined by four of the five other tribes that made up
the once-mighty Iroquois confederacy, sought to overturn treaties
made in 1785 and 1788 under which the land was sold for about
$50,000.
   The Oneidas claimed the Articles of Confederation, which governed
the United States before the Constitution was ratified, prevented
New York or any other state from enacting the treaties.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the articles
``did give the states the power to purchase Indian land within their
borders and extinguish Indian title to such land so long as such
activity did not interfere with Congress' paramount powers of war
and peace with the Indians.''
   Arlinda Locklear, a lawyer representing about 13,000 Oneidas in
New York, Wisconsin and Canada, called the ruling ``legally wrong
and morally wrong.'' She said she expected to seek either a
rehearing by the 2nd Circuit or to petition the U.S. Supreme Court
for a hearing.
   The defendants included the state of New York, various state
agencies and two companies with operations in the area, St. Regis
Paper Co. and Georgia Pacific Corp.
   Ray Halbritter, one of two federally recognized representatives
of the Oneidas in New York, said that although the tribe lost in the
lower courts before, ``where we have won is at the Supreme Court
level.''
   ``I'm just hoping that this will not force us into more
litigation,'' he said from Cambridge, Mass., where he is a law
student.
   The Oneidas are still negotiating the claim with the state, he
said.
   At issue is a strip of land, 50 to 60 miles wide, running through
the heart of New York from Ogdensburg on the St. Lawrence River
south past Binghamton to Hales Eddy on the Pennsylvania line.
   The lawsuits were brought in 1978 by the Oneida Indian Nation of
New York, the Oneida Indian Nation of Wisconsin and the Oneida of
the Thames Band, of Ontario, Canada.
   They later were joined by four of the other tribes that make up
the Six Nations of the Iroquois: the Onondagas, the Mohawks, the
Senecas and the Tuscaroras. The Cayugas are the sixth nation.
   Boston lawyer Allan vanGestel, who represented the 12 New York
counties encompassed by the land claim, said the decision is
expected to end to one of the largest Indian land claims in the
eastern United States and also will have a major impact on future
Indian claims.
   ``Essentially, the court had to interpret the meaning of the
Articles of Confederation, and what they said is that ... the state
did not have to get permission from the central government,'' he
said.
   Circuit Judge Jon O. Newman, who wrote the 52-page opinion,
quoted James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers.
He called the case ``unusual because it requires a federal court,
perhaps for the first time, to determine whether actions of a state
violated the Articles of Confederation.''
   The appeals panel also rejected the claim that the land sale was
barred by a 1784 U.S.-Iroquois treaty that guaranteed the Oneidas
and Tuscaroras, who sided with the colonists in the Revolution,
``possession of the lands on which they are settled.''

   President Corazon Aquino today shut
down the country's largest domestic shipping line, which lost one
ship in a typhoon last week and another last year in one of the
world's worst maritime accidents.
   Transportation Secretary Reinerio Reyes said the indefinite
suspension of Sulpicio Lines Inc. was effective immediately.
   ``The main reason is we want to prevent loss of lives,'' Reyes
said. ``We want to make sure they (ships) are seaworthy and manned
by competent crews.''
   Sulpicio operates 22 passenger and cargo vessels that account for
20 percent of domestic sea traffic among the country's 7,200 islands.
   In Cebu, Sulpicio President Carlos Go said he was unaware of the
order.
   ``It's bad for the public because they have fewer vessels to
ride,'' Go said. He declined further comment.
   The suspension came one day before Sulpicio officials were to
appear before the Maritime Regulatory Authority to show cause why
the company should not be suspended.
   A Sulpicio passenger ship, the Dona Marilyn, sank Oct. 24 during
Typhoon Ruby with about 500 people aboard. It was about 300 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Vicente Gambito, vice president of Sulpicio Lines, said 161
passengers and 39 crewmen have been rescued and at least 76 people
confirmed dead.
   Last December, Sulpicio's Dona Paz collided with an oil tanker
off Mindoro island and more than 3,000 people were believed to have
perished.
   The accidents led to calls by the Manila press and prominent
politicians for a crackdown on maritime safety regulations.
   ``Since Sulpicio is beset by these accidents, we would like to
have a closer look at their operations,'' Reyes said. ``We want to
check out their ships and in the interest of the safety of
passengers, I have recommended to the president to suspend
indefinitely their passenger liners.
   ``The president agreed that this was the right step to take,'' he
added. Reyes said the order was not expected to disrupt passenger
service because other companies operate similar routes.
   Earlier today, the Transportation Department issued orders
holding four Sulpicio ships in port pending an inspection of their
communications equipment.
   Reyes said investigators would inspect Sulpicio's fleet for
seaworthiness and to make sure they had proper equipment.
   He said if widespread deficiencies were found, ``it could result
in the permanent removal'' of Sulpicio's operating franchise.
   Meanwhile in Cebu, the coast guard said the search for more
survivors was suspended today because a tropical depression was
threatening the area.
   Last week, Jose Luis Alcuaz, chief of the National
Telecommunications Authority, told a Senate committee that the Dona
Marilyn sailed through rough seas for nearly six hours before
changing course in a failed attempt to escape the storm.
   ``We will have to find out why of the 13 ships which sailed, only
the Dona Marilyn sank and 12 others diverted their route,'' Reyes
said.
   The Dona Marilyn's skipper is among the missing.

   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union reached an
8{-year high in October, with 2,473 Jews allowed to leave, the
organization involved in their resettlement said today.
   Only 78 of the emigres went to Israel after passing through the
transit center at Vienna, said Regina Boucault, spokeswoman for the
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration.
   She said the Soviets have allowed 14,288 Jews to leave the
country so far this year, and 1,232 of them have gone to Israel.
   The October figure was the highest since March 1980.
   The largest official annual exodus _ 51,330 _ was recorded in
1979 before the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West
relations.

<TEXT>
   The teen-age son of reputed underworld
boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo was in critical condition
today after he was found hanging by the neck while father was on
trial on racketeering charges.
   Mark Scarfo was discovered by his mother Tuesday afternoon at the
former offices of Scarf Inc., the elder Scarfo's concrete business
here, officials said.
   The youth was brought to Atlantic City Medical Center in a coma,
said Sherry Spatz, a spokeswoman for the hospital.
   ``He went into cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated by
paramedics,'' Ms. Spatz said. ``He's unconscious and he's in
critical condition.''
   News of the injury reached federal court in Philadelphia late in
the afternoon and brought a halt to the elder Scarfo's trial. His
attorney, Robert Simone, said the trial might be postponed for
several days.
   The elder Scarfo, reputed to be the longtime crime boss of South
Jersey and the Philadelphia area, and nine others are charged with
running a criminal enterprise that included murder, extortion, drug
dealing, loan sharking and gambling.
   Simone said the hanging was a suicide attempt, and Atlantic
County Prosecutor Jeffrey S. Blitz said all evidence pointed to a
suicide. He declined further comment. But the prosecutor's office's
major crimes unit was investigating before ruling out a homicide
attempt.
   Dr. Sekander Ursani, an emergency specialist at the hospital,
said he found no visible sign of injury on Mark Scarfo except for a
bruise on his neck.
   Simone gave the youth's age as 17, but the hospital listed it as
18.
   Scarfo was on full life support systems, although he was able to
breathe on his own, Ursani said. He said a breathing machine was
being used to help keep his lungs clear of fluids.
   Simone said there was no sign of brain damage, but Ursani said it
was too early to tell if the lack of oxygen caused serious injury.

<TEXT>
   Authorities in Detroit are seeking the
extradition of a man who allegedly posed as a priest and counseled
relatives of victims of a Northwest Airlines plane crash last year,
then referred them to a laywer.
   Police arrested the man, John Irish, on Tuesday at a hotel here
where he had been working for at least several months as manager,
said Nancy Mouradian, spokeswoman for the Wayne County (Mich.)
Sheriff's Department.
   ``We didn't know anything about it or about him,'' said the
hotel's assistant manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It
was a shock to us. ... I worked with him on a day-to-day basis and
didn't know anything about him.''
   Irish, 47, faces charges in Wayne County, Mich., of obtaining
money under false pretenses in an amount exceeding $100, said
Special Constable Brad Clairmont of the Trenton Police Department.
   An FBI warrant for Irish's arrest also accuses him of unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution, Mouradian said.
   Authorities allege that Irish defrauded Northwest Airlines of
about $1,100 in hotel and food charges paid by the airline while he
posed as ``Father John Irish'' and counseled relatives of some of
those killed in the Aug. 16, 1987, crash at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport. All but one of the 154 people aboard Flight 255 died, along
with two on the ground.
   Irish was being held Tuesday night at a detention center in
Napanee pending a bail hearing scheduled for today in Belleville
District Court, Clairmont said. If convicted of the felony fraud
charge, he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined
$10,000, Mouradian said.
   Sgt. Bill Armstrong, the arresting officer, said Irish was born
in Birmingham, England, but his current citizenship was unknown.
   Trenton police questioned Irish two months ago about an alleged
sexual assault at the hotel and discovered he was wanted in Michigan
when they ran his name through a computer, authorities said.
   Irish had lived at least since in March in Trenton, an eastern
Ontario city of about 15,000, the officer said.
   Witnesses and law enforcement officials said after the Flight 255
crash that Irish distributed business cards for Ronald Brimmell, an
attorney in Deerfield Beach, Fla.
   Police in Denver said a man matching Irish's description talked
to survivors of the crash of Continental Airlines Flight 1713 at
Stapleton International Airport in November 1987, in which 27 of 82
people aboard were killed.

<HEAD>Japan To Cut Uranium Imports From South Africa</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: To conform to style, changes name of Namibia to South-West

<TEXT>
   In an apparent move to cut economic ties with
Pretoria's white minority government, four Japanese utilities say
they will not renew contracts to import uranium from South Africa
and its territory South-West Africa.
   The four regional utilities named in news reports as having
decided not to renew long-term contracts are Tohoku Electric Power
Co., Kansai Electric Power Co., Chubu Electric Power Co. and Kyushu
Electric Power Co. The Kansai utility refused comment today, but the
others confirmed the change.
   The four utilities own 16 of the 35 nuclear reactors operating in
Japan and have seven more under construction or planned. Japan gets
about 29 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants.
   Japan has been embarrassed by its emergence as South Africa's
biggest trading partner while others among its Western allies have
reduced commercial links in a drive against South Africa's apartheid
policy of racial separation.
   The Japanese government has said it is monitoring such trade _ an
implicit warning of possible sanctions against companies that
increase trade with South Africa.
   In 1986, the government urged utilities to refrain from entering
new contracts with South Africa, said Nobuo Tanaka, director for
international nuclear energy affairs in the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
   ``Since then no new contracts have been made, and we understand
that our utilities will not go into any new contract with South
African mines,'' the official said in a telephone interview today
with The Associated Press.
   Tokyo Electric Power Co., the world's largest private utility,
says it has sought assurances from the British-based supplier RTZ,
or Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp., that it will not receive uranium from
South-West Africa, which is also known as Namibia.
   Tanaka said the situation regarding South-West Africa, which
Pretoria governs in defiance of a United Nations resolution, is more
complicated because of the circuitous route uranium follows as it is
processed in several stages to be usable in nuclear reactors.
   RTZ-supplied uranium may come from Namibia or other sources, he
said, but it goes through a conversion process in Britain and then
is enriched in the United States by the U.S. Department of Energy
before it reaches Japan.
   ``The Japanese government position is that there is no way to
identify the country of origin'' of such uranium, said Tanaka.
   But he said Japan wanted to comply with a U.N. decree restricting
economic support of South Africa's administration of Namibia. ``The
utilities of course know such a decree is there. They also have been
respecting this decree,'' Tanaka said.
   ``They are cautious entering into new contracts,'' he added.
   Spokesman Yasuho Takaya of the Tohuku utility said his company
was not renewing contracts with RTZ that end this year and those
with the South African supplier that end next year.
   ``We have the same position as the Japanese government,'' Takaya
said. ``We don't like apartheid.''
   He said the Tohoku utility obtains 10 percent of its uranium from
South Africa and 10 percent from RTZ through Britain. Its major
sources are 60 percent from Canada and 20 percent from Niger. The
company has ample stocks to draw on, he said.
   Tokyo Electric Power Co., which has 11 operating reactors, said
it has never received South African uranium but was concerned about
the origin of uranium supplied by RTZ.

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old cerebral palsy victim who
set fire to his home in a suicide attempt was charged with arson and
first-degree murder in the blaze, which killed two of his brothers,
officials said.
   The Maryland State Fire Marshal's office and Howard County police
charged Jacob S. Clemons of Ellicott City as an adult in Sunday's
fire, which killed 6-year-old James Clemons and 8-year-old Michael
Clemons.
   If convicted, the ninth-grader could be sentenced to life
imprisonment on the two murder counts, a prosecutor said. An arson
conviction is punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
   County District Judge James Vaughan on Tuesday ordered Jacob sent
to Springfield Hospital Center in Sykesville for an emergency
evaluation to determine if he may be a danger to himself or others.
   In court records, police said Jacob admitted setting fire to the
house in this Baltimore suburb ``with reckless and wanton disregard
of the consequences.''
   Investigators said they believed he set fire to his mattress in a
suicide attempt, then had second thoughts and tried to put out the
blaze.
   A county police spokesman said authorities were reluctant to
press charges against Jacob because of his medical condition, the
fact that he is under psychiatric care and out of consideration for
the family, but felt they had to.
   ``Two people died in a fire that was deliberately set,'' said
Sgt. Angus Park. ``In pure legalistic terms, that's murder.''
   Public Defender Carol Hanson, who is representing Jacob, asked
that her client not be incarcerated at the county jail.
   ``At this time, it is in his best interests to be in a hospital
under the care of a physician and psychologist,'' she said.
   Investigators said they hoped to obtain more information about
Jacob's mental state from interviews.
   But Vaughan, acting at Hanson's request, issued a protective
order prohibiting police and prosecutors from interviewing him about
the fire.
   No family member was present at the court proceedings.
   Jacob kept his head bowed during a brief initial hearing before
District Court Commissioner Walter F. Closson, who ordered him held
without bond because of the first-degree murder charges.
   Authorities then arranged a bond review hearing before Vaughan to
avoid sending the youth to the jail.
   Bob Thomas, a spokesman for the state fire marshal's office, said
the case probably would go before a county grand jury in the next
few weeks.
   ``The attempted suicide is something we are looking into. We
cannot comment at this point as to the certainty of that,'' Thomas
said.
   After the fire began, the boy rushed to awaken his 28-year-old
brother-in-law, officials said. They and four others survived the
fire, which occurred while the boy's parents, David and Sally
Clemons, were on vacation with several other of their children.
   The teen-ager is one of 15 adopted children and one biological
child raised by the Clemonses. Many have disabilities or are
foreign-born.
   The two who died of smoke and soot inhalation tried to escape
through a sliding glass door, but were unable to open it,
authorities said.

<HEAD>Woman Accused In Small Kidnapping Admits She Lied; Case To Go To

<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old woman accused of helping her
boyfriend kidnap and murder a businessman who was buried alive says
she lied repeatedly to police about the crime because she was
``scared to tell them the truth.''
   Jurors were expected to begin their deliberations today after
attorneys' closing arguments in the trial of Nancy Rish, who is
accused of assisting in the kidnap and murder of Stephen Small.
   Small was the 40-year-old great-grandson of an Illinois governor
and the son of the late Burrell L. Small, who controlled a group of
radio and television stations.
   In September 1987 he was kidnapped, then buried at a remote
gravesite between Kankakee and the Indiana line. His body was found
two days later and authorities said he suffocated in a homemade
wooden coffin before his family could pay a $1 million ransom.
   Testifying in her own defense Tuesday, Ms. Rish admitted she had
lied to police after she and boyfriend Daniel Edwards were arrested.
   ``It was dawning on me what Danny was up to and I was scared,''
said Ms. Rish of Bourbonnais. ``He was putting me in the middle of
this. He used me. I was very angry with him.''
   She admitted that she drove Edwards to telephone booths from
which authorities said ransom calls were made to the Small family in
Kankakee, but said she did not know why Edwards was making the calls.
   The day before the kidnapping, Ms. Rish said, Edwards had her
drive to a site in the country, where authorities believe the ransom
was to be dropped. She said she later picked Edwards up at the same
spot but had no idea of its significance.
   But prosecutor Michael Ficaro recited a list of statements Ms.
Rish gave to police, asking each time if she had lied. Each time,
she said yes.
   ``I was scared to tell them the truth,'' she said.
   The prosecutor also suggested that she changed some details of
her story only after she thought police knew the truth.
   Edwards, 31, who lived with Ms. Rish, was convicted of murder and
kidnapping in May and sentenced to die. The prosecution has not
sought the death penalty for Ms. Rish, who faces identical charges.
   Ms. Rish described Edwards' mood after the kidnapping as
``nervous'' and ``tense.'' Later, after making calls from several
pay telephones, Ms. Rish said, Edwards seemed ``mad, upset.''
   Authorities believe Small's kidnapper called his family to play a
tape-recording of the ransom delivery instructions to his wife,
Nancy, and later made a call from another phone to tell her he was
angry because police had been notified.
   Mrs. Small was unable to understand the delivery instructions and
no ransom was paid.

<HEAD>Former Israeli Premier Says His Likud Bloc Won The Elections</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Israel-Election, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin broke his
customary silence today to proclaim the party he once headed the
victor in Israel's parliamentary elections.
   ``The results are clear. Labor failed in these results ... Likud
(bloc) is in the first place,'' said Begin, who has lived as a
recluse since quitting the premiership without explanation in 1983.
   Begin, 75, shared the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat for their roles in the Camp David accords.
   On Israel's armed forces radio today, Begin said he planned to
telephone Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud leader, to
congratulate him.
   ``From his (Shamir's) point of view and the point of view of
Likud, this election is an achievement,'' he said. Begin also said
he was sorry he was unable to vote in the election, but he did not
elaborate.
   The former premier said the left-leaning Labor Party, Likud's
main rival, was the big loser in the elections because it lost six
parliament seats to right-wing parties.
   Likud won 39 seates in the 120-member parliament, while Labor won
38. The results for both parties were down from the last election in
1984, when Labor won 44 seats and Likud took 41.
   Four small religious parties captured 18 seats, giving them a
great deal of bargaining power in negotiations to form a coalition
government with Labor and Likud.
   Begin conceded that because Likud failed to win a clear majority,
the party faced ``prolonged and difficult'' negotiations to form a
government. ``But let's see what sort of government we will have in
time. As I said, it ended positively.''

<HEAD>NCAA Basketball Champs Barred From Defending Title</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to CORRECT that probation bars team from
post-season play in first year, not from all competition.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Kansas basketball team
has been barred from defending its national basketball championship
because of recruiting violations.
   The three-year NCAA probation issued Tuesday resulted from
violations that occurred under former Coach Larry Brown, who has
since left Kansas for the San Antonio Spurs of the National
Basketball Association, the National Collegiate Athletic Association
said.
   Current Kansas basketball coach Roy Williams said he is angry
about the probation, but that his team will adapt.
   The probation, which bars post-season play in the first year,
could be extended with even stiffer penalties should Kansas commit
further violations within the three years.
   The school also must disassociate itself from backers that Brown
identified as Jerry Collins, formerly in broadcast production for KU
and now in a similar role for the San Antonio Spurs; Ralph Light,
president of RAL Construction of Kansas City; and Mike Marshall, a
former KU player who worked in Brown's basketball camp during 1986.
   The team also cannot bring recruits on paid trips to the campus
for a year. And the school will be stripped of one scholarship
during that period.
   Brown said the penalties resulted largely from improper
recruiting inducements given to one-time transfer student Vincent
Askew during a 10-day period in 1986. Brown, Collins, Light and
Marshall were responsible for the inducements, which included
airline tickets to and from Kansas, Brown said Tuesday.
   ``I'm just sorry it happened,'' Collins said. Light would not
comment. Marshall could not be reached for comment, nor could Askew.

<HEAD>Military Chief Says United States Must Identify Allegedly Corrupt
Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's military chief today
expressed anger at charges Thai officers stole $3.5 million in
covert U.S. aid for Cambodian guerrillas and said U.S. officials
must name the culprits.
   Gen. Chavailit Yongchaiyudh told reporters at Supreme Command
Headquarters that he had no knowledge of any alleged corruption. He
said the charges, first reported in The Washington Post Sunday, have
hurt morale in the army.
   ``The Washington Post must reveal more details to back those
allegations because it is irresponsible to talk lightly of something
as accusatory as this,'' he said. ``That, or go to hell.''
   Chavalit said he has ordered an investigation, but added that he
doubted anything could be proven because he said the Americans
handle the financial administration of the aid program.
   ``If any U.S. official can identify the culprits, come tell us,''
he said. ``But if he knows but won't come forth, then we cannot work
well together and cannot call ourselves friends.''
   Other Thai officers have denied there was any corruption.
   The program is operated by CIA officers in Thailand, which the
guerrillas use as sanctuary and support in fighting Vietnamese
troops that invaded Cambodia in late 1978. The money is funneled to
the guerrillas at least in part through the Thai military.
   The aid, in the form of non-lethal items and training, goes to
the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and former Prime Minister Son
Sann and is intended to strengthen their position relative to the
third guerrilla group, the communist Khmer Rouge. The latter group
killed hundreds of thousands in Cambodia before Vietnam invaded.
   The aid program has since been cleaned up but is operating at
reduced levels, U.S. officials in Washington say.
   The Washington Post report said CIA officers in Thailand first
turned up evidence earlier this year that money had been skimmed off
from the program, which totaled $12 million in fiscal 1988. An audit
team dispatched to Thailand by the Senate Intelligence Committee
confirmed the scheme.
   The team's report to the intelligence panel on July 12 sparked
disagreement over whether the covert support should be continued,
The Post reported.
   At the time, the United States was seeking to increase the aid
program.
   It was decided to reduce the amount of U.S. support to $8 million
in the current year and to institute strict accounting procedures.

<HEAD>Palauans In Festive Mood For National Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KOROR, Palau (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palauans voted in a festive presidential
election today less than three months after the western Pacific
archipelago's president committed suicide and three years after his
predecessor was assassinated.
   The election is of special interest to the United States and
other Pacific governments because of Palau's strategic military
importance.
   Six challengers sought to unseat President Thomas O. Remengesau,
55, who was vice president when President Lazarus Salii died Aug. 20
of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.
   Salii was elected three years ago to complete the term of
President Haruo I. Remeliik, who was assassinated.
   The apparent front-runners were Remengesau, a longtime government
official; and wealthy businessmen Roman Tmetuchl, 52, and Nigratkel
Etpison, 63, political observers said.
   The other candidates are Moses Y. Uludong, former Minister of
State John O. Ngiraked, traditional chief Yutaka M. Gibbons and
House Speaker Santos Olikong.
   The winner will serve four years and be paid $35,000 a year.
   Voters also cast ballots for a new vice president and national
congress.
   Tabulation began tonight after polls closed. Ballots are counted
by hand, and the final outcome is not expected for several days.
Palau is west of the international dateline, putting it a day ahead
of the United States.
   A turnout of 80-85 percent of the 11,174 registered voters, 2,000
of whom live off the islands, was expected.
   An estimated 15,000 people live on eight of the 200 islands that
form Palau, which lies 600 miles east of the Philippines and 4,500
miles southwest of Hawaii.
   Palau is the world's last trusteeship, established in 1947 by the
United Nations. The United States administers the archipelago's
affairs.
   For nearly 20 years, Palau has been seeking a new political and
economic arrangement with the United States, which views its
location near critical sea lanes as being of strategic importance.
   Though marred by passing rain showers today, election day was
reminiscent of a U.S. county fair. Voters were plied with free food
and soft drinks at open-air booths outside key voting stations, and
children waved handmade signs on the main road of Koror, Palau's
business and government center.
   ``It is the livliest and most energized election I've seen,''
said Uludong.

   Arabs reacted with disappointed today to the
results of Israel's general election, as some agreed with King
Hussein that a victory by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is a setback
for Middle East peace prospects.
   Foreign Minister Taher Masri of Jordan, whose country shares
Israel's longest border, predicted Shamir's Likud bloc would form a
coalition government within days with several small ultra-Orthodox
religious parties.
   ``We think such a government will be a blow to the efforts of
peace, especially at this time when everyone, the two superpowers,
the world at large, is becoming more flexible about reaching the
basis for a peaceful settlement,'' Masri told The Associated Press.
   But Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Butros Ghali,
told reporters: ``Egypt will do business with any new government in
Israel in order to ... achieve a peaceful settlement of the
Palestinian problem on the basis of implementing the principle of
self-determination.''
   Egypt, the only Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel,
has worked with Jordan on ways to reach a broader settlement. Both
hinted before the election that they favored a victory by Shamir's
rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the Labor Party.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt said in a statement:
``Egypt is ... anxious to emphasize the need for action to carry on
with the peace process to achieve stability in the region. For its
part, Egypt will make every effort to this end and hopes the new
Israeli government will do likewise.''
   Hussein told the ABC television network on Oct. 20 that a Shamir
victory would be ``an absolute disaster.''
   Shamir opposes Arab demands for a U.N.-sponsored Arab-Israeli
peace conference and for Israel's withdrawal from Arab lands
captured in 1967.
   Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member
Mohammed Milhem said the Israeli vote showed ``the society in Israel
is not for peace.
   ``It seems that in Israel, and for a long time to come, there
will be no chance for peace, no chance for a government that
advocates peace,'' said Milhem, the elected mayor of the West Bank
town of Halhoul, who was deported by the Israelis in 1980.
   Milhem expressed skepticism about both major parties, but said:
``With Shamir, there may be more chances for peaceful settlement
than (with) Peres. He's going to escalate. He's going to kill more
people, deport more people.''
   ``The war is going on and it will be going on .... Innocent lives
on both sides will have to be sacrificed,'' he said. ``It's because
the Israeli rulers have chosen this line.''
   Wahid Jabari, who represented the West Bank city of Hebron in
Jordan's Parliament, stayed up late into the night listening to
Israel rRadio for news of the voting.
   ``I was expecting success for Likud,'' Jabari said. ``The Israeli
extremists are more numerous than those who want peace.''
   Assad Abdul-Rahman, a political scientist on the PLO's central
committee, said a Likud victory would be better than a continuation
of the Likud-Labor coalition of the past four years.
   A relatively weak Likud-led government ``will increase
polarization within Israeli society,'' he said.
   Ismael Makiyeh, a grocery store owner in Amman who fled Palestine
before Israel was created in 1948, said, ``It would be a disaster
having Shamir serve another term. I'm very pessimistic. There isn't
going to be peace in this part of the world having a stubborn
neighbor like that around.''

<HEAD>Tax Receipts Fall Short; Dukakis Administration Sees `Fiscal
Challenge'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state government has been overdrawn at the Bank
of Boston by as much as $190 million as state tax collections fell
below projections for October, Dukakis administration officials said.
   The disclosures Tuesday, coming one week before the presidential
election, were considered damaging to the reputation for fiscal
management cultivated by Gov. Michael Dukakis as he wages his
underdog campaign for the White House.
   The admissions also gave to new fuel to angry Republicans in the
legislature who have called for an investigation of the state's cash
management practices.
   At a news conference, Secretary of Administration and Finance
Frank Keefe tried to reassure reporters about the state's underlying
economic strength.
   ``We face a fiscal challenge, not a fiscal crisis,'' Keefe said,
citing the state's low unemployment rate and high rate of personal
income growth. ``When you have the No. 1 economy in the country, you
don't have a fiscal crisis. Your economy will see you through.''
   A shortage of tax collections has forced the state to tap
short-term borrowing for $1.2 billion _ at a cost of nearly $10
million _ since the fiscal year began on July 1, Keefe said.
   In addition, Keefe confirmed accusations by Republicans that the
state was overdrawing its principal bank account at the Bank of
Boston.
   ``There is nothing illegal about it. I want to make that clear,''
said Patrick Sullivan, the deputy state treasurer, at the Statehouse
news conference. ``We have this agreement with the Bank of Boston.
We've had it for years.''
   Sullivan said the longest period of continuous overdrafts was 30
days ending Tuesday and that the peak overdraft was $190 million. He
said he could not say how much the state paid in penalties.
   Under state law, Keefe sets fiscal policy on behalf of the
administration. Treasurer Robert Q. Crane, an independently elected
official, handles day-to-day cash management, including borrowing,
paying bills and investing free cash.
   Keefe and Sullivan said the state actually has some $430 million
in ``cash or cash equivalents'' on hand in other accounts. But, they
said, the treasurer elected to run an overdraft at the Bank of
Boston rather than tap those accounts because the cash deposits were
earning higher rates of interest than the potential penalties on an
overdraft.
   Critics said the announcement that tax collections were lower
than expected was evidence that Dukakis will not be able to balance
the state $11.6 billion budget without deep spending cuts or a tax
increase.
   ``There's one purpose to all this: to mask the fiscal crisis
until after the election,'' said state Sen. Paul Cellucci, a state
co-chairman of the Republican presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
   Marine sentries at a U.S. Air Force
fuel storage depot traded shots on-and-off for almost two hours with
unidentified intruders, but there were no injuries, the U.S.
Southern Command says.
   The gunfire occurred Monday night on the southern edge of the
Arraijan Tank Farm and began when ``11 Marines in listening posts
heard movement, voices and visually confirmed the presence of armed
intruders in the jungle,'' the Southern Command statement said.
   In Washington, the Pentagon said ``there were six more exchanges
of fire ... off and on until about 10 p.m.'' It said the incident
was under investigation.
   Sentries have reported numerous intrusions at U.S. military
facilities in Panama this year.
   A Marine sentry was killed April 11 at the tank farm when he was
accidentally shot by fellow guards as they were investigating the
first of the intrusions by what were described as eight men in dark
uniforms.
   The 807-acre fuel storage depot is in a hilly, jungled area about
five miles west of Panama City, the capital, and 1{ miles west of
the United Stats' Howard Air Base.
   ``When the Marines verbally challenged the intruders, the Marines
were fired on by automatic and small arms fire. The Marines returned
fire with small arms'' and fired some illumination rounds, Tuesday's
statement said.
   The Southern Command, which is responsible for all U.S. military
operations in Latin America, reported four intrusions in April at
U.S. military facilities in Panama by what one spokesman called
``highly trained professionals.''
   In July, American soldiers exchanged gunfire with unidentified
intruders on two occasions at Arraijan, the Southern Command said.
   The Southern Command statement said the Marine contingent
involved in Monday night's shooting forms ``part of security forces
temporarily dispatched to Panama since last April as part of
increased security measures to protect U.S. citizens, property and
interests'' in the former canal zone.
   Neither the Panamanian government nor the Defense Forces had any
immediate comment. In the past incidents, the country's military has
said its troops were not involved and suggested the U.S. sentries,
nervous and inexperienced, had imagined intruders.
   The Defense Forces are commanded by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the country's de facto leader. Noriega is under criminal indictment
in the United States on charges of cocaine trafficking.
   The Reagan administration has sought his ouster, through a series
of economic sanctions and negotiations, but has not been successful.

   The dollar changed little against most major
currencies in thin mid-morning trading today, and dealers forecast a
steady course before the Nov. 8 presidential election in the United
States.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar bounced back in Europe
from lows hit during the Tokyo trading day on support from a third
day of intervention from Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan,
and fear of the same by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   But they said sentiment remained essentially bearish, although
the dollar was unlikely to fall sharply ahead of the U.S. election.
   ``The nearer we come to the election the calmer the dollar will
be,'' said one trader in Milan.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. One pound
cost $1.7695 today, more expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late
$1.7668.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates compared with Tuesday's late rates:
   _1.7824 West German marks, down from 1.7865
   _1.4990 Swiss francs, down from 1.5025
   _6.0835 French francs, down 6.0965
   _2.0100 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0155
   _1,323.85 Italian lire, up from 1,331.50
   _1.2270 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2278
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.68 Japanese yen, down
0.62 yen from late Tuesday. Later, the dollar traded in London at
124.90 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $411.65 a troy ounce, up
from $411.25 late Tuesday. At mid-morning, London's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of $412.50 a troy
ounce.
   Gold was trading in Zurich at $412.10 a troy ounce today, up from
$411.00 Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $413.90, up slightly
from Tuesday's $413.89.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid $6.34 a troy ounce, up
from $6.28.

<HEAD>Sakharov Criticizes Gorbachev's Political Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet activist Andrei D. Sakharov lashed out at Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's plan for political reform, saying it was a ``time bomb''
that would give the Soviet leader a dangerous monopoly of power,
published reports said.
   Sakharov, the Soviet Union's most prominent human rights
advocate, on Tuesday strongly criticized parts of Gorbachev's
proposals as a return to centralization that could augur a new age
of Stalinism.
   ``A head of state with such powers in a country that does not
have a multiparty system is just insanity. This is practically
boundless power,'' he said. ``Today it is Gorbachev, but tomorrow it
could be somebody else. There are no guarantees that some Stalinist
will not succeed him.''
   The Nobel Peace Prize-winning physicist made the comments to
reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post during a
conference with Soviet and U.S. scholars in Moscow.
   Sakharov, who has been a strong supporter of Gorbachev since the
Soviet leader ordered him released from internal exile nearly two
years ago, added his voice to growing criticism of the proposed
system from Soviet intellectuals.
   While the newly published draft election laws and constitutional
amendments have been promoted as a move toward greater democracy, he
said, they are actually a ``time bomb'' that would create a national
leader ``vested with absolute power.''
   ``Once more, everything boils down to one person, and that is
extremely dangerous for perestroika,'' he said, referring to
Gorbachev's plan for restructuring the Soviet economy. ``This is an
extremely important question, on which the fate of our country
depends.''
   The proposed new electoral system, approved at a Communist Party
conference in July, calls for the election of a new Congress of
People's Deputies, which in turn will pick a new legislature and
president. Critics contend the congress, and thus the legislature,
could be manipulated by party functionaries, and the president would
have extraordinary powers to issue decrees.
   ``This is perestroika from above,'' said Sakharov. ``It can only
develop further with real democratic foundations. Without them,
reform is at a dead end.''
   While shift of power to a legislature is ``essential,'' he said,
``these changes will determine our life for a very long time. Before
you cut your clothes you must take at least seven different
measurements. Surely we need at least three months for this
discussion.''
   The new laws are scheduled to be approved by a special session of
the Soviet legislature on Nov. 29

<HEAD>Dentists Oppose Tooth Sculpture Honoring Fluoridation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dentists aren't pleased with plans for
a giant molar sculpture intended to commemorate the first city to
fluoridate its drinking water, saying the statue would send the
wrong signals about dentistry.
   ``Fluoride is probably the single most significant healing effort
in dentistry and an extracted tooth represents just the opposite _
feelings of pain or suffering or anxiety,'' said Dr. Charles
Caldwell, president of the 400-member West Michigan Dental Society.
   Artist Mark Heckman, 26, said he learned recently that his
hometown made history in 1945 by being the first to add fluoride to
its water, but was shocked there was nothing to commemorate the
event.
   ``I wanted to raise all the money myself and give the sculpture
to the city as a present,'' Heckman said Tuesday. ``At first,
everybody was telling me what a great idea it was, but the dentists
have stalled the whole thing.''
   His plan, dubbed ``Operation: Pearly White,'' consists of a
600-pound, 18-foot-long abstract fiberglass sculpture of a tooth
balanced atop a stainless steel pole 22 feet above the Grand River
downtown.
   Heckman said he has tried to work with the dental group, changing
his design from a traditional-looking, three-rooted molar to the
abstract tooth, but to no avail.
   ``I didn't want it to be obvious that it was a tooth. But now the
dentists are sensitive about it looking like a mutant molar _ it
makes them cringe,'' Heckman said, holding his mouth in feigned
pain. ``I don't think anybody else is going to think about that when
they look at it.''
   The steel pole on which the tooth would sit hasn't been a winning
point either. ``To me, that symbolizes the dental instrument,'' said
Heckman, whose girlfriend is a dental hygienist.
   Mayor Gerald Helmholdt said he likes the design but sympathizes
with the dentists' concerns.
   ``I think it could be unique and certainly most unusual for a
piece of art,'' the mayor said. ``But I think it's important to have
the dental association's support of a sculpture because they're so
closely tied to its purpose.''
   Caldwell said the dental society has formed a committee to design
a fountain to be dedicated in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the
fluoridation.
   Heckman, who received receiving a letter of support from former
President Gerald Ford, a former Grand Rapids congressman, and
funding commitments for the $55,000 tooth, has vowed to dedicate his
sculpture next July.
   The decision ultimately will be made by the City Commission.
   Heckman compared his fight to the opposition fluoridation
proponents faced when the idea was introduced.
   ``Fluoride was called a communist plot, forced medication, or
worse yet, rat poison,'' Heckman said. ``Those who advocated
fluoridation had to face tremendous opposition. But they didn't give
up _ and neither will I.''

<HEAD>Plane Crash Reported In Southeastern Poland, Deaths Reported

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet-built domestic airliner with 29
people aboard crashed in southeastern Poland on a domestic flight
today and some of the passengers were killed, authorities said.
   The official PAP news agency reported that 16 people were killed,
but a police official in Rzeszow, near the scene, said the figure
was too high and he could confirm only one death.
   Police Capt. Jerzy Pacula said many passengers survived with
minor injuries.
   The Antonov-24 twin-engine turboprop plane, was on a flight from
Warsaw to Rzeszow when it crashed in the village of Bialobrzegi, PAP
said. It was carrying 25 passengers and four crew.
   The plane went down _ apparently due to a mechanical failure _ in
an empty field about 170 miles southeast of Warsaw, said Pacula, the
officer at police headquarters in Rzeszow.
   He said by telephone that the pilot was moments from making an
emergency landing when he lost control and the aircraft plummeted to
the ground.
   All the crew members survived, and the slightly injured pilot was
aiding rescue operations at the scene, Pacula said.
   He said workers were planning to cut into the side of the plane
to free passengers believed still trapped inside.
   Poland's worst air disaster occurred on May 9, 1987, when a
Soviet-built Ilushin-62-M jetliner on a LOT flight to New York
crashed outside Warsaw after one engine broke apart. It killed 183
people.

<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Maryland today announced the introduction of a credit card for use
when paying for health care not covered by insurance.
   The card, Medcash, can be used to charge medical and dental bills
that are not covered by health policies, such as deductibles for
hospital and doctor bills, medication, cosmetic surgery and other
elective procedures.
   Medcash can also be used for preventive health care, such as
routine doctor visits, weight-loss clinics and home blood-pressure
kits.
   Cardholders do not have to belong to Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
   More than 300 health care professionals and hospitals have agreed
to accept the card, which will be test-marketed in Baltimore. The
card later will be expanded nationally through Club Cross and Blue
Shield plans around the country.
   ``Medcash is a card totally dedicated to the health care
industry,'' said Jack Rapport, president of Health Line Inc., a
subsidiary of the insurance company.
   The card, Rapport said, allows consumers to separate health care
expenditures from retail purchases and provides a form of insurance
against unforeseen medical expenses.
   It will provide initial credit of $1,000 to $5,000, with the
possibility of obtaining additional coverage in an emergency by way
of an 800 number.
   No interest will be charged if the balance is paid within 25
days. The card will charge competitive interest rates and provide a
three-year repayment plan, the company said.
   In addition, Rapport said, the card will cut the time and money
health care providers spend on sending and collecting bills.

<HEAD>Gain Reverses Second Quarter's Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate America boosted its productivity in
the third quarter, reversing a loss of efficiency in the second
quarter that was much greater than economists had previously
calculated, the government said today.
   Productivity among non-farm businesses responsibile for
three-fourths of the nation's economic activity rose at an annual
rate of 1.3 percent from July through September, the Labor
Department said, with a 2.8 percent increase in output and only a
1.5 percent rise in hours worked to achieve it.
   In the second quarter, productivity dropped by 2.4 percent, the
first quarterly decline since 1986. Earlier calculations had put the
second quarter efficiency loss at only 1.4 percent.
   The calculation of growth in second quarter output was revised
from 5.2 percent to 4.0 percent.
   Meanwhile, productivity in the manufacturing sector, which
accounts for about one-fourth of the nation's economic activity,
rose 4.3 percent in the third quarter on a 6.5 percent increase, the
biggest this year, in output of goods coming off assembly lines.
   Factories achieved the increased output with an increase of only
2 percent in hours worked, reflecting a leveling off in hiring new
workers.
   The Labor Department figures showed manufacturing wages and
benefits rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the third
quarter, compared with 3.8 percent over the last year.
   But the increased output enabled U.S. factories to maintain labor
costs at only 0.3 percent above what they were in the second quarter
and only 0.7 higher than they were a year ago, compared with a 4.2
percent annual inflation rate.
   Even with the larger pay gains recently, the figures show factory
workers making 0.3 percent less than they did a year ago for each
hour of work after taking inflation into account.
   Businessmen as a whole have not been so successful in keeping a
lid on their labor costs. In the third quarter, labor costs among
non-farm businesses rose at an annual rate of 4 percent on hourly
wage and benefit gains averaging 5.4 percent annually.
   Over the last year, hourly wages and benefits have risen an
average of 4.9 percent among non-farm businesses, giving workers in
the private sector generally a 0.7 percent increase in their buying
power after taking inflation into account.

<TEXT>
   The leftist government indefinitely
suspended a private radio news show for broadcasting a story about a
reported air force bombing, the Sandinista newspaper Barricada said
today.
   The Interior Ministry order, reprinted in the newspaper, said the
show ``6 O'Clock Sharp,'' aired on Radio Corporacion, violated the
government's communication law. A newscaster aired a news service
story Monday citing U.S.- supported rebels as saying the air force
bombed Indian villages along the Atlantic Coast as hurricane victims
sought refuge in Honduras.
   The article of the communication law cited by the ministry bars
the media from reporting on unconfirmed events and those that
threaten national security.
   The media sanctions are the latest in a series that started in
July with the 15-day suspension of the only opposition newspaper, La
Prensa, and the news show on the Roman Catholic Radio station's
Radio Catolica. The government charged that the newspaper and radio
station reported inflamatory news.
   Last month the government shut down the news show operated by a
coalition of private enterprise groups. The Interior Ministry cited
a broadcast by a leader of the rebels, also known as Contras.
   The latest closure was announced in the newspaper under a
headline reading: ``Suspended Indefinitely A Lying News Show.''
   Radio Liberacion, the clandestine Contra station, reportedly
located in El Salvador, repeated its claims today about the bombing
and said several people died and others suffered serious injuries.
The report criticized the Sandinista closure of the news show,
saying it was ``repression ... against the people.''

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis in Fine Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors for both presidential candidates say
they are in excellent health, except for minor conditions not
unusual for people of their ages and lifestyles.
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis suffers an occasional backache
made worse by campaign travel, Dr. Gerald Plotkin said. He issued a
medical statement on Dukakis' health last September after a routine
medical checkup at the Harvard Community Health Plan's Wellesley
Center.
   The candidate ``was found to be in excellent health,'' Plotkin
said.
   ``Over the last eight to 10 months he has had intermittent,
nagging low back discomfort exacerbated by long periods of sitting
in airplanes,'' the doctor said.
   Plotkin said then that Dukakis, who will be 55 Thursday, took an
occasional anti-inflammatory medication to ease the back pain.
Dukakis told The New York Times in an interview published today that
he had an occasional but no longer bothersome sore back.
   Plotkin said Dukakis had only received treatment for routine
ailments, such as hay fever and muscle sprains, and ``has had no
psychological symptoms, complaints or treatment.''
   ``He has had no significant illnesses during his lifetime and has
been in excellent health,'' Plotkin said. ``He has never appeared
depressed to me.''
   Doctors interviewed by the Times said George Bush, 64, is in
excellent health. Bush has a mild enlargement of the prostate gland
but they do not expect corrective surgery to be necessary in the
next four years.
   He had a basal cell skin cancer removed from his face in 1986,
but has no symptoms of other cancers. He is allergic to bee stings
but is receiving immunotherapy injections to stave off potentially
life-threatening allergic reactions.

   The Parks Department tore down tarpaulins
sheltering about 100 homeless people who had camped out in a park
for five months trying to force the city to give them apartments.
   ``It got so out of hand it got ridiculous. It was like an outdoor
bazaar,'' said city Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, who ordered the
tarpaulins in City Hall Park carted off Tuesday.
   The homeless were allowed to take their personal belongings. They
have been staying in the park in a demonstration demanding housing,
and had used park benches and fences as supports for tarpaulins.
   ``We're not kicking them out of the park,'' said Mayor Edward I.
Koch, but he added that the homeless were not permitted to build
shelters in the park.
   ``That's the law. And we're going to enforce the law,'' he said.
   Stern said that because of the camp site, park paths were blocked
off, benches were filled and shrubbery was covered.
   By early afternoon Tuesday, several of the homeless were back,
sitting on the benches, getting soaked by the rain.
   One, who identified himself by the nickname Heavy, said, ``I
didn't stay out here for 154 days for nothing!''
   ``We're out here fighting for a cause. We're fighting for our
lives,'' he said.
   It was at least the second time the Parks Department dismantled
their shelters.
   Larry Locke, a leader of the demonstration, has urged the city to
turn over a vacant apartment building which he said the homeless
would rehabilitate.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen told supporters in
southern Illinois today that Vice President George Bush's choice of
Dan Quayle as his running mate illustrated the ``real disdain'' that
Republicans have for the American public.
   The Democratic vice presidential nominee attacked Quayle several
times for his Senate voting record, including his opposition to
requiring employers to give workers 60 days' advance notice of plant
closings or mass layoffs.
   The Texas senator said Bush's selection of Quayle for the vice
presidency showed that the GOP nominee would do anything to win the
Nov. 8 election.
   ``Bush showed a real disdain, disregard for our country,''
Bentsen said.
   He was introduced by Illinois' two Democratic senators, Alan
Dixon and Paul Simon, who said Bentsen would win handily if
Republican senators were polled on which vice presidential candidate
they preferred. ``It would be a wash-away,'' Simon said.
   Simon advised the crowd, ``Don't believe the polls,'' which show
Bush with a significant lead over Democratic rival Michael Dukakis
nationwide. Bentsen has been delivering the same message, insisting
that the Democratic ticket is narrowing the gap in the final days of
the campaign.
   From Illinois, Bentsen travels to Ohio and West Virginia before
returning to Texas in the wrapup of a campaign swing that is taking
him through six states in three days.
   At every stop, Dukakis' running mate compares the Democratic
ticket's fate with efforts by Harry Truman and John Kennedy, who
came from behind in the last weeks of the campaign and won.
   ``Today, the polls are closing, the momentum is our way,'' he
told a rally attended by about 2,000 students Tuesday night at
Washington University in St. Louis.
   The Republicans think the campaign is over and are ``popping
those campaign corks, but I'll tell you on November ninth they're
going to have the worst hangover they've ever had,'' he said.
   As he has been doing at other stops, Bentsen held over his head a
reprint of the 1948 Chicago Tribune which declared, wrongly, ``Dewey
Defeats Truman.''
   Mike McCurry, Bentsen's press secretary, said the message would
remain simple through the final days of the campaign. Bentsen will
talk about how the Republicans have distorted Michael Dukakis'
record through negative campaigning, and he will continue to attack
Dan Quayle, George Bush's running mate.
   ``Those two issues are weighing heavily on the minds of voters
who are reconsidering their initial choice'' of Bush as their
candidate, McCurry said.
   Bentsen, in his speeches, cites polls selectively to highlight
those which show the Democratic campaign gaining ground on the
Republican ticket.
   McCurry, asked about new national polls sponsored by news
organizations showing double-digit leads for Bush, said, ``we don't
necessarily think those are accurate. They are not consistent with
the campaign's own polls,'' he said.
   Tuesday evening in Owensboro, Ky., Bentsen addressed a huge crowd
of more than 2,500 people in a tobacco warehouse. To that crowd of
conservative Democrats, he said the Republican assertion that
Dukakis was weak on defense was nonsense.
   He told them the Democrats support a military that is best in the
world.
   ``I'll tell you what a second-best defense system is,'' he said.
``It has all the value of a second-best poker hand. All it does is
cost you money.''

   Michael Dukakis invoked the memories of other
underdog Democratic presidential candidates today and urged
supporters to ``keep pouring it on'' in the closing days of the 1988
campaign.
   ``This is one election where millions of people are going to be
looking and thinking and listening, and they're not going to be
making up their mind until very close to the moment when they go
into that polling booth,'' he told a rally in a downtown hotel.
   Dukakis then went to the University of Minnesota Hospital, where
his wife, Kitty, is recovering from a respiratory viral infection.
He took an unscheduled detour from Kansas City, Mo., to Minnesota
late Tuesday for a post-midnight visit with his wife.
   The Democratic nominee visited his wife for 40 minutes after this
morning's rally, and together they waved to reporters from her
sixth-floor hospital window. Downstairs, Dukakis said she was ``a
good deal better'' but that ``she's got to take it easy, one day at
a time.''
   Joining Dukakis at the rally were Massachusetts Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy and Minnesota Senate candidate Hubert H. Humphrey III.
   Kennedy urged the partisan crowd to ``do the same thing for the
governor of Massachusetts and Skip Humphrey that you did for John
Kennedy in 1960.''
   Kennedy also joked about the candidacy of Humphrey, son of the
late Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey.
   ``The only trouble I have with Skip Humphrey,'' said Kennedy,
``is he is trying to get along on the basis of a famous family
name.''
   Dukakis said the presence of Kennedy and Humphrey on the platform
``reminds us of some very important elections.''
   He cited Harry Truman's upset victory in 1948, Kennedy's close
win in 1960 and the closing drive of Humphrey in 1968 when he nearly
overtook Republican Richard Nixon.
   Dukakis urged the crowd ``to keep pouring it on and pouring it
on. There are millions and millions of voters out there who haven't
made up their mind.''
   Dukakis told reporters at the hospital that his wife ``seemed to
be much improved'' in fighting off ``a pretty tough virus,'' but
said it was uncertain whether she would be well enough to return to
the campaign trail before Tuesday's election.
   ``She said she loves me,'' he replied when asked what Mrs.
Dukakis had said to him.
   ``And what did you say to her?''
   ``I love her.''
   At rallies in Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Missouri, large
crowds cheered Dukakis' newly refined populist message.
   In the crowded gymnasium at Penn Valley Community College in
Kansas City, he repeatedly invoked the memory of the state's
favorite son, Harry Truman, the hero of all Democratic Party
underdogs.
   Saying he would win by taking his message to the people, Dukakis
added, ``That was Harry Truman's prediction in 1948 and it's my
prediction today.''
   Truman defeated Republican Thomas E. Dewey 40 years ago despite
an overwhelming consensus that he had no chance to win.
   He ridiculed President Reagan's suggestion that if Truman, a
highly partisan Democrat, were alive today he would support Bush.
   ``I've got a message for Mr. Bush and he Republicans,'' said
Dukakis ``Harry Truman stood for the little guy and you're looking
at him.''
   The basketball scoreboard in the gymnasium read, ``Duke 50 Bush
0.''
   A large sign said, ``We need a president and a vice president,
not a vice president and an idiot.''
   Dukakis reminded crowds at every stop that there were only seven
days remaining until Election Day.
   ``Give it everything you have, everything you have over the next
seven days,'' he urged his supporters.
   Two new national polls had no good news for Dukakis.
   A CBS-New York Times survey said Bush was leading by a margin of
53 to 41 percent, while an ABC-Washington Post poll put the Bush
lead at 55 to 42 percent. The polls had margins of error of plus or
minus three and four percentage points, respectively.
   Senior political adviser Kirk O'Donnell said Dukakis' own polls
put Bush ahead by seven points and insisted with campaign chairman
Paul Brountas, ``We're closing in.''
   ``National polls no longer have that kind of significance,'' said
Brountas.
   ``We're looking at the battleground states,'' he said. ``We're
making progress in those states.''

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis visited his ailing wife for the second time today, joined
her in waving from her hospital window and said ``she's a good deal
better.''
   ``She's got to take it easy, one day at a time,'' Dukakis told
reporters after the 40-minute visit at the University of Minnesota
Hospital, where Kitty Dukakis was admitted Monday night complaining
of chills and a 102-degree fever.
   Mrs. Dukakis' press secretary, Paul Costello, said today that
``her spirits are terrific. Her temperature is normal.''
   Costello said Mrs. Dukakis hoped she could join her husband on
the campaign trail in time for his 55th birthday Thursday, but
Dukakis said it was too early to say whether she'd be well enough to
leave the hospital by then.
   During their reunion this morning, the couple waved to reporters
from Mrs. Dukakis' sixth-floor hospital window.
   Dukakis made a campaign detour Tuesday night to Minneapolis for a
post-midnight visit with his wife that lasted for a half-hour.
Afterward, he said she was ``pretty sick'' and would remain in the
hospital at least through today.
   Hospital spokeswoman Mary Stanik said Mrs. Dukakis was suffering
from an upper respiratory viral infection or an allergic reaction to
sinus medication.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 51, was hospitalized for observation and tests
Monday when she complained of fever and chills while campaigning.
   ``She was pretty sick yesterday,'' said Dukakis, who took his
wife red flowers and was accompanied by their daughter Andrea.
``She's just got to take it easy.''
   Asked what his wife said to him, the Massachusetts governor
replied, ``She said she loves me.''
   ``And what did you say to her?''
   ``I love her.''
   ``She's going to be fine,'' he told reporters at the hospital.
``It's just got to be one day at a time.''
   Dukakis, who flew in Tuesday night after campaigning in four
states during the day, said he didn't know when Mrs. Dukakis would
be released, but ``it certainly won't be'' today.
   Stanik said Mrs. Dukakis requested sushi for dinner Tuesday and
that it was brought in from a local restaurant. Stanik said she also
ate cookies and half a brownie.
   Mrs. Dukakis waved to television reporters standing below her
sixth-floor room at one point Tuesday.
   Dukakis had planned to visit his wife again after appearing at an
early morning rally here and campaigning in Chicago later today.
   Paul Costello, her press secretary, said Mrs. Dukakis is anxious
to resume her campaign schedule, but no decision had been made to
when that might occur.
   Mrs. Dukakis was operated on this summer for a herniated disk.
Doctors in Minnesota ruled out any connection between her current
illness and that operation.

<HEAD>Trespass Trial Opens For 14 Black Legislators In Confederate Flag
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen black legislators, including
state NAACP President Thomas Reed, went on trial today on
misdemeanor trespass charges for trying to remove the Confederate
battle flag atop Alabama's Capitol.
   District Judge Craig Miller, who is presiding over the non-jury
trial, agreed to let TV cameras record the proceedings.
   Miller earlier rejected defense claims that the lawmakers were
protected by legislative immunity when they made a mostly symbolic
bid on Feb. 2 _ the opening day of the 1988 legislative session _ to
bring down the flag.
   The offense carries a penalty of up to three months in jail and a
$500 fine.
   Reed, 60, the senior black in the Legislature, in 1970 became one
of the first two blacks this century to win a seat in the Assembly.
   He was convicted last month on federal extortion charges in an
unrelated case, and a court ordered his removal upon sentencing. No
sentencing date has been set.
   Reed claims the extortion case was built against him because of
his threat to pull down the Confederate flag if Republican Gov. Guy
Hunt failed to do it before the opening day of the 1988 legislative
session.
   Hunt said he viewed the flag as a historic emblem and refused to
remove it unless instructed to do so by the Legislature. On Feb. 2,
a resolution to remove the Rebel standard failed to win passage.
   The 14 legislators walked to a chain-link fence surrounding the
Capitol, which is now closed for restoration and renovations, where
they were stopped by state troopers and Capitol police, who declined
to let them enter.
   Reed grabbed the fence as if to climb it, and was arrested. One
by one, the other blacks grabbed the fence and were arrested as well.
   Former Gov. John Patterson said the Confederate flag was raised
over the Capitol in 1961 to coincide with the Civil War centennial.
   The flag was still atop the dome when George C. Wallace became
governor in 1963 with the pledge of ``segregation forever,'' and the
never came down.
   Defendants in district court trials, if convicted, have the right
to request a full-scale jury trial at the circuit court level.

   Michael Dukakis visited his hospitalized wife today and told
supporters millions of voters were still ``thinking and listening,''
keeping the presidential race open. George Bush, with a solid lead
in national polls, said voters should ``look beyond the charges'' in
the heated race.
   With six days to go, Bush told students at a high school in
Prairie View, Ill., near Chicago, ``In just a few days from now many
of you in this room will help select the next president of the
United States and I ask for your vote.
   ``You're not going to make your decision on some television
(advertisement) or some sound bite, and what I want you to do is
look beyond the charges, get past the shouting and choose as
president the person who represents your values, your dreams, your
hopes for the United States, and I am that man.''
   ``I think things are moving in our direction,'' Bush said, but he
quickly returned to his daily disclaimer that ``I'm going to keep on
running as though I'm 10 points behind.''
   Democrat Dukakis spoke at an early hotel rally in Minneapolis,
where he had flown Tuesday night to visit his wife, who was
hospitalized with a viral infection.
   He spent 40 minutes with her after the rally, and they waved from
her 6th floor window. When he came down, he said, ``She's a good
deal better.''
   Dukakis urged the crowd at the rally to ``keep pouring it on and
pouring it on. ... This is one election where millions of people are
going to be looking and thinking and listening and they're not going
to be making up their mind until very close to the moment when they
go into that polling booth.''
   He was joined by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and by
Hubert H. Humphrey III, the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat
his father once held. Dukakis said the two men's presence ``reminds
us of some very important elections.''
   He went on to cite John F. Kennedy's presidential victory in 1960
and Humphrey's closing drive that nearly caught Republican Richard
M. Nixon in 1968. Dukakis also mentioned, as he does frequently,
Harry Truman's upset victory in 1948.
   With the race for the White House in its final week, President
Reagan was getting in some campaigning today with a stop on behalf
of the vice president in Ohio, one of the battlegrounds. He said
voters should reject ``far-out liberalism'' when they cast their
ballots.
   New polls released a week from Election Day showed the Republican
presidential nominee still leading solidly.
   A CBS News poll conducted Saturday through Monday showed Bush
ahead by 12 percentage points, 53-41 percent _ virtually the same as
the 13-point lead a CBS poll had shown a week ago.
   But fully one voter in five said he could still change his mind
before Election Day. The survey was of 1,066 probable voters and had
a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll done Wednesday through Monday
gave the GOP nominee a 13-point lead over Dukakis, 55-42 percent.
The survey of 1,099 probable voters had a margin of error of four
percentage points.
   An ABC News poll in California showed Bush the leader by seven
percentage points in the nation's largest state, and another survey
by the network indicated a close race in Illinois, with Bush leading
48-47, statistically meaningless in light of the poll's five-point
margin of potential sampling error.
   Dukakis aides contended their own private polls showed the
Democratic presidential nominee gaining on his Republican rival in
battleground states. Privately, some Democrats expressed doubts.
   The Democratic nominee was campaigning today in Minneapolis,
Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia, where he was joining former
Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson at rally at a local high school.
   Dukakis appealed to black voters Tuesday night at Detroit's
Greater Grace Temple, where he said the Republicans have ignored the
needs of inner cities and are insensitive to the plight of
minorities. Dukakis was joined by Rosa Parks, whose refusal to move
to the back of a Montgomery, Ala., bus was a milestone of the civil
rights movement.
   Bush spoke to an evening rally in Waukesha, Wis., where he took a
line directly from Dukakis' new populist campaign theme.
   ``I am on your side,'' Bush declared. ``You are on my side.''
   But in Nevada, Reagan was mocking Dukakis for that same line.
   ``The liberals now are saying that they're on your side,'' Reagan
said. ``I guess they think that that will make it easier for them to
reach their hand around and put it in your pocket.''
   While Dukakis kept a frenetic campaign pace, Bush was just the
opposite. He campaigned enough to avoid seeming too confident, but
was serene enough to deliver an above-the-fray address on
presidential concerns.
   Bush went to the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.,
where he pledged to ``appoint moderate persons of conservative
views'' to the Supreme Court. He said Dukakis ``would appoint
doctrinaire liberals.''
   Bush also said he would seek an early meeting with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to allow them to ``size each other up
correctly.''
   Bush's running mate Dan Quayle was to campaign in South Bend but
saw his schedule abruptly changed by the Bush campaign headquarters.
He voiced irritation, but campaigned elsewhere in his native state.
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen campaigned in
Kentucky where he spoke to a crowd in a tobacco warehouse and said
the Democrats are committed to having the best military in the world.

   Republican George Bush, beginning a determined
push to get out the vote, urged people today to ``look beyond the
charges, get past the shouting and choose as president the person
who represents your values.''
   Before a screaming crowd of mostly young people who filled the
Adlai Stevenson High School gymnasium, Bush declared, ``I am that
man.''
   With only six days remaining before Americans choose a new
president, Bush hit the campaign trail with a plea for GOP turnout.
   ``Do not forget your solemn obligation to vote,'' Bush told the
crowd _ many of whom were too young to vote.
   The high school rally was the first stop before Bush headed to
Grand Rapids and Lansing, Mich., and then a trip to Columbus, Ohio,
for an overnight stop. Reflecting the closeness of the race in
Illinois with its 24 electoral votes, Bush will return to the
Chicago area again Thursday for another appearance.
   ``I come before you at the end of a long, long journey,'' Bush
said at the high school. ``In just a few days from now many of you
in this room will help select the next president of the United
States and I ask for your vote.
   ``You're not going to make your decision on some television
(advertisement) or some sound bite, and what I want you to do is
look beyond the charges, get past the shouting and choose as
president the person who represents your values, your dreams, your
hopes for the United States, and I am that man.''
   Expressing optimism about the outcome of the race, Bush said, ``I
think things are moving in our direction,'' but quickly added his
standard disclaimer that ``I'm going to keep on running as though
I'm 10 points behind.''
   On Tuesday, Bush indicated he would seek an early summit with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to explore possibilities for
deeper arms cuts and solutions for other superpower problems.
   ``The Oval Office requires an unflashy common sense and I will
try to bring that kind of common sense to the Oval Office,'' Bush
told an audience of 2,000 people at the University of Notre Dame.
   Two nationwide polls released Tuesday night indicated that Bush's
backing extends far and wide. The vice president held double-digit
leads of 12 and 13 points in the two surveys.
   Bush, during an impromptu stop Tuesday night at a Polish dinner,
expressed eagerness for the campaign to end.
   ``I'll sure be glad,'' Bush told a crowd of hundreds of people.
``That six days is going slow. It's like a caterpillar crawling
across the plate.''
   In sharp contrast to his frequent declarations that he's running
as if he were 10 points behind, Bush began talking about how he
would run the White House.
   ``I don't know what the cutting moments will be for the next
president but I know they'll come and I know I'm ready,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm no mystic,'' he added, ``and my leadership might not be the
most charismatic, but I'm not sure we need a lot of razzle dazzle.
There's probably enough drama in the world today.
   ``But I'll try to be fair, I'll try to be wise and I'll listen,''
Bush said.
   For the first time, Bush said that as president he would be
prepared to meet with Gorbachev so they could ``size each other up
correctly.''
   Bush said he would be ready to meet the Soviet leader ``at the
earliest time that would serve the interests of world peace.
   ``And my purpose in such a meeting would not be to achieve any
grand breakthrough but to engage in a serioius and direct
examination of where we are and how we can best go forward toward
further arms reductions, a decrease in regional tensions and further
adherence to human rights, and thus toward a surer peace.''
   On another subject, Bush said the next president likely will have
``a high number of seats to fill on the Supreme Court.''
   ``I will appoint moderate persons of conservative views. I
believe my opponent would appoint doctrinaire liberals,'' he said.
   ``The excessive judicial activism of the '60s and '70s is one
reason Americans turned against that kind of liberalism by the
'80s,'' Bush said.
   Several dozen protesters shouted anti-Bush messages and one
heckler stood up and screamed, ``Lies, lies.''
   Bush, pausing in his speech, said: ``There's always some guy who
jumps up at these rallies and says the same thing. So don't let it
bother you.''
   Bush scorned Michael Dukakis' reputation for dwelling on details,
saying, ``I think he's guided more by abstract theories and grids
and graphs and computer printouts and the history of Swedish social
planning'' rather than ``old fashioned common sense.''
   The vice president also took issue with Dukakis' identification
with the liberal tradition of former Presidents Franklin Roosevelt,
Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy.
   ``I have had some programmatic differences, but I respect the
tradition of Harry Truman and FDR, a liberalism that was committed
abroad and concerned at home, a liberalism that spoke for some good
things like civil rights,'' Bush said. ``But some of today's
liberals do not see as clearly as their forefathers.''

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the nation.
   Nov. 1
   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on saving the whales in Alaska:
   Was it worth spending $1.3 million trying to save the three, now
two, wayward whales that were trapped in a prison of ice near Point
Barrow, Alaska?
   Ask any child who fell in love with the California grays or any
champion of the underdog who watched the heroic efforts for three
weeks and they'll probably respond with a resounding, emotional
``yes.'' ...
   Others persuasively argue the event was nothing more than
frenzied Arctic madness fueled by international media hype, and to a
lesser extent, guilt over what mankind has done to enhance chances
of whale extinction.
   They claim the effort endangered the lives of many people who
flocked to the whales without Arctic survival training and really
did little to preserve the species. These whales _ which were not
the first, nor will they be the last to become trapped in Alaskan
ice _ may yet die before reaching the warm waters of Mexico's west
coast. ...
   A more important question: Why do we exert such valiant efforts
for such creatures while we ignore or turn our backs on fellow human
beings all around us trapped in the brutally icy confines of
violence, poverty, hunger, homelessness, loneliness, illness and
hopelessness?

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on leveraged buyouts:
   What's wrong with leveraged buyouts? In principle, nothing. In
practice, plenty.
   When RJR Nabisco's management proposed last month to purchase all
the company's outstanding stock, it planned to incur nearly $20
billion in debt _ a sum so great the company's future may be
impaired. But since it isn't public money, why should the public
care?
   Because when many large companies overload themselves with debt,
they diminish their ability to improve their productivity, reduce
their competitiveness abroad, even jeopardize their very survival
should a recession occur.
   And low productivity, not to mention major bankruptcies by large
companies, imperil the economy's health and stability.
   It may pay management to take a company private _ indeed it
usually does in the short run. Having a personal financial stake in
a major enterprise in a profitable year can make the difference
between earning a substantial salary and a major fortune.
   But the large economy is put at risk. To the extent that the
current tax code encourages debt _ and it does _ it should be
changed a soon as possible.

   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on the ``liberal'' label:
   The one word that America did not hear at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. ... The one word that makes Democratic
professional politicians shudder.
   ``Liberal'' _ the ``L'' word!
   We think it's time (liberals) came out of the closet.
   Imagine what the late Hubert H. Humphrey would have done with the
``liberal'' label. ``The Happy Warrior'' would have made it his
badge of honor rather than a label of shame.
   There have been many great liberal ideologists, men and women who
have worked for great and good change in society. It's too bad the
current crop of Democrats are treating the word ``liberal'' as if it
meant ``leprosy.''

   The Bremerton (Wash.) Sun on the federal deficit:
   Members of the 100th Congress have scurried home to campaign in a
self-congratulatory mood. With bipartisanship, strong leadership and
a new assertiveness, Congress has done much to undo the excesses of
the Reagan years.
   But Congress and Reagan have one thing in common. Both tap-danced
past their gravest responsibility, deficit reduction. ...
   Congress allowed the deficit crisis to worsen and the
Gramm-Rudman deficit plan to weaken. The havoc that will follow if
Congress slowly strangles Gramm-Rudman will dwarf its other
accomplishments. ...
   Gramm-Rudman is now little more than a bookkeeping dodge. The
1985 bill mandated progressive deficit reductions until 1991, when
the budget was supposed to balance.
   Congress moved that date back to 1993. And it raised the 1988
deficit limit from $108 billion to $146 billion.
   Cynics said from the beginning Gramm-Rudman was more a gesture
than a solution. Congress should repeal the bill rather than engage
in this sort of charade.
   For all its new boldness, though, Congress won't do that. It has
perfected a new maneuver, the Deficit Dodge.

   The Miami Herald on hate groups:
   White supremacists, neo-Nazis, anti-Semites, and any others
dedicated to demonstrating their bigotry should be on notice:
Violate the rights of those whom you love to hate, and you'll be hit
where it hurts _ in the wallet.
   That's the message that a federal court jury wisely sent (last)
week when it ruled that two white-supremacist groups must pay nearly
$1 million damages to racism protesters.
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and other civil rights organizations report
increases in hate groups and racist violence. These laws, crafted to
combat 1860s racism, unfortunately still are needed in 1988.
   In that light, it's ironic that the Supreme Court has voted to
reconsider its 1976 Runyon vs. McCrary ruling, which permits
individuals to seek punitive damages for private acts of
discrimination.
   This is no time to diminish what is often the last bastion of
legal hope for victims of irrational hatred.

   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on presidential projections on TV:
   Hours before the polls close, the TV networks will declare a
winner in the presidential contest, based on returns from polling
places in the East. That will cast a what's-the-use pall over those
who haven't yet voted.
   The networks are constantly refining their sampling techniques,
and some analysts think this year's election night ... will bring
even quicker news of the winner _ which will make things even worse
out West.
   Some states have tried to restrict exit polling, a major
data-gathering technique, but federal judges have struck these laws
down on constitutional grounds.
   The most practical solution would be to apply a uniform
nationwide poll-closing time. ...
   Two months ago, the Senate Rules Committee approved a bill that
would close polls at 10 p.m. EST _ 7 p.m. PST _ beginning with the
1992 election. The House passed a similar measure in 1987. But the
legislation died with Congress' adjourment.
   There'll be time to revive it before the next election. Perhaps
the spectacle on Nov. 8 ... will spur the next Congress to do the
job quickly.

   The Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel on political appointees:
   A commission of Washington experts has come up with a new way to
thwart the democratic process.
   Headed by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, the
National Commission on Public Service proposes that President
Reagan's successor reduce the number of political appointees in the
federal bureaucracy.
   From Cabinet members downward, the total number of such
appointees is slightly more than 5,000 _ roughly two-tenths of 1
percent of the entire federal work force.
   All too often, this tiny beachhead is engulfed by tenured civil
servants whose first priority is to protect their own programs and
careers.
   The Washington establishment has ways to guard the status quo
that the framers of the Constitution never imagined _ such as a
Congress in virtually year-round session and tens of thousands of
specialized lobbyists and legislative staffers who almost always
want to enlarge existing programs, not shrink them.
   This ``permanent government'' hardly needs more power to screen
out newcomers loyal to a president's mandate.
   The percentage of political appointees in the federal
establishment should not be cut, it should be doubled.

   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on preserving Brazilian forests:
   Brazilian President Jose Sarney says it was the fact that 6,000
man-made fires were discovered burning in virgin Amazon jungle
during one day that suddenly made him aware of the danger to the
ecology.
   Consequently, in a policy flip-flop that has gratified
environmentalists the world over, Sarney has reversed Brazil's
20-year-old policy of ruthlessly exploiting the vast jungles of the
Amazon valley and the tropical rain forests of the Atlantic coast.
   The global importance of the great rain forests of Brazil is
difficult to underestimate. They constitute a major ``lung'' of the
world, manufacturing life-sustaining oxygen and absorbing carbon
dioxide, one of the gases trapping solar heat and contributing to
the alarming greenhouse effect, feared to be raising the earth's
temperature.
   The consequences of destroying the world's remaining tropical
forests are profound for a human population that demands
ever-increasing amounts of oxygen. The whole planet has an interest
in Sarney's heartening promise to preserve the Brazilian jungles.

   Houston Chronicle on last-minute campaigning:
   When the campaign itself becomes the dominant campaign issue,
it's a pretty good sign the campaign has run its course.
   Michael Dukakis calls Republican campaign material garbage.
George Bush says Democratic Party tactics are insidious. Lloyd
Bentsen says the Republicans are running a miserable campaign. Dan
Quayle says the Democrats are throwing political sludge.
   Any voter seeking enlightenment from what is going on now is out
of luck. ... At this point, both national campaigns seem more
interested in exchanging accusations than exploring issues.
   So be it. It's their campaign to run.
   The voters are due one note of caution, however, about the nature
of political campaigns, nationally and locally.
   Strange charges seem to surface in the last days before an
election. Whether out of desperation or calculation, rumors float
and pamphlets without sources appear.
   Common sense calls for taking these late arrivals with a grain of
salt.

   The Press-Enterprise, Riverside, Calif., on the whistleblower
veto:
   President Reagan really had to scrape to come up with an excuse
to kill a bill that would have provided protection to
``whistleblowers'' _ federal employes who report fraud and
mismanagement.
   The bill was approved by the House 418-0 and by the Senate on
unanimous voice vote, and with good reason. Federal employees should
be encouraged to report wrongdoing.
   And yet the president has decided to exercise his ``pocket veto''
by letting the bill die without his signature while Congress is not
in session.
   His rationale? Reagan said the measure would have allowed
employees ``who are not genuine whistleblowers'' to manipulate the
process to delay or avoid discipline. ...
   One has come to expect that kind of reasoning from Ronald Reagan.
And from the Justice Department, which urged the president to oppose
the bill. ... New Attorney General Dick Thornburgh ... simply
trumpeted the position taken on the bill by his predecessor, Edwin
Meese, who was anything but a model of good standards.
   This incident gives the distinct impression that the Reagan
administration's standard of justice has not benefitted by the new
stewardship at the Justice Department.

from U.S. laws. ...
   Indictments (issued last week) accuse Marcos, his wife and a
number of associates of illegally backdating documents in
hundred-million-dollar real estate deals, concealing ownership of
valuable property, evading court-ordered freezes on assets and
attempting to defraud courts and financial institutions. ...
   State Department officials attempted to negotiate a settlement
with Marcos in which he would surrender hundreds of millions of
dollars taken from the Philippines in return for having the charges
dropped. ... But Marcos refused the agreement. ...

   The Milwaukee Journal on Mossy Cade playing again with the
Packers:
   It says something disturbing about America's infatuation with
sports that the No. 1 question in Green Bay (Wis.) these days is not
whether Mossy Cade should play for the Packers again, but when.
   Cade is the defensive back recently paroled from prison after
serving 15 months of a two-year sentence for sexual assault. Bad
enough that the punishment was so light; the Packers compounded the
injustice by welcoming back Cade to his $250,000-a-year,
high-visibility job.
   The Packers first described the Cade move as a football decision,
not a public relations decision. They were right about that.
   Then they claimed that state law barred them from discriminating
against Cade because of his criminal conviction.
   The Packer bosses just don't get it. Of course they shouldn't
discriminate. Cade, like any other ex-con, is entitled to work. But
he doesn't have to play. ...
   Cade ... surely ... can fill a job on the periphery of sports
that wouldn't put him on television once a week during autumn. And
if, as the Packers contend, they are obligated to take Cade back,
that's exactly the kind of role they ought to find for him.

<TEXT>
   NASA officials, fearing a delay in the
shuttle program, are seeking to keep the agency's only manufacturer
of rayon from closing after it suffered big losses stemming from the
Challenger disaster.
   NASA said Tuesday it was talking to Avtex Fibers-Front Royal Inc.
to keep the supply of a rayon yarn used in shuttle rocket nozzles in
production, while the Air Force identified three missiles that could
be affected.
   The company took NASA by surprise when it announced Monday that
it would close the Front Royal plant on Thursday, idling 1,300
workers and cutting off the government's only supply of the rayon,
said Jerry Berg, a spokesman at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``It will jeopardize the space program if we do not figure some
way to get Avtex Fibers back on line by spring,'' said Jim Thomas,
assistant to the solid rocket motor program manager at Marshall.
   Avtex Chairman John N. Gregg said Monday that without Avtex's
rayon, the shuttle program might be grounded for up to two years
after one more launch.
   But Berg said there was enough of the rayon on hand for ``the
next several shuttle flights.'' NASA initially said the next 12
flights through May 1990 would be able to stay on schedule, but Berg
revised the statement later in the day.
   Rocky Raab, a spokesman for the maker of the shuttle motors,
Morton Thiokol Inc., said it was too early to say what impact the
closing could have.
   The fibers manufactured by Avtex are woven into a cloth by other
companies, Raab said. Two more layers of contractors that treat it
to make it resistant to high heat.
   Thiokol buys the finished product for use in the nozzles of its
shuttle motors, Raab said.
   John Kelly, an Avtex spokesman in New York, said he did not know
of any talks between Avtex, based in Valley Forge, Pa., and the
government that could keep the plant producing the rayon.
   Gregg said he lost a large amount of money because of the
Challenger disaster that idled the shuttle program for more than 2{
years.
   At Andrews Air Force Base, Md., a spokeswoman for Air Force
Systems Command said officials had determined that at least one
missile system, stage one of the small ICBM, used the rayon.
   Two other systems, the MX intercontinental ballistic missile and
the Titan satellite launcher, may also depend on the rayon, but
officials had not determined that for certain by late Tuesday, Maj.
Janis Bybee said.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree to Permit Teaching of Hebrew, Visiting Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials have agreed to permit the teaching
of Hebrew and to allow Soviet Jews to participate in the World
Jewish Congress, an official of the international group said today.
   Both steps, announced by World Jewish Congress executive director
Elan Steinberg following meetings with high-level Soviet officials,
would constitute major changes in how the Kremlin has dealt with the
country's 1.8 million Jews.
   They come in the context of an effort by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to eliminate rancorous issues that have historically
hampered the Kremlin's relations with the West, including in the
field of human rights.
   As part of that effort, 1975 Nobel Peace laureate Andrei D.
Sakharov is being allowed to travel to the West for the first time,
and the Soviets have reportedly agreed to release all political
prisoners by the end of the year.
   Edgar Bronfman, World Jewish Congress president, met for two
hours today with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and later
with Konstantin Kharchev, chairman of the Soviet State Committee on
Religious Affairs, Steinberg said in a telephone interview.
   ``Soviet authorities have now agreed that the Soviet Jewish
community can participate in the activities of the World Jewish
Congress,'' Steinberg said, reporting on accords reached during the
meetings. He said the exact form of participation remains to be
worked out.
   The World Jewish Congress represents Jewish groups from 70
countries whose combined Jewish populations total 11-12 million,
Steinberg said. Those countries include Eastern European allies of
the Soviet Union, where the local Jewish populations have a central
representative body, he said.
   Soviet Jews have no such central body as of now, Steinberg said.
   Assessing the agreement reached with the Soviets, the World
Jewish Congress official said: ``We view this as part of a larger
process of easing tensions between East and West which includes a
better understanding and relationship with Jewish communities of the
world and with Israel.''
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, made
general comments about the meeting between Bronfman and Shevardnadze
at a government news briefing, but provided few specifics on any
agreements reached.
   ``At the request of Edgar Bronfman, Eduard Shevardnadze gave
detailed explanations concerning the real state of affairs in such
issues as emigration from the U.S.S.R., including that of Jews, the
freedom of worship and of cultural and educational activities,''
Gerasimov said.
   He said he would have details on the talks between Bronfman and
Shevardnadze at Thursday's news briefing.
   The unsanctioned teaching of Hebrew was once treated in the
Soviet Union as a criminal offense, and several Jewish activists
went to prison for giving unauthorized instruction in the language.
They included Josef Begun, who was allowed to emigrate to Israel
this year.
   But an agreement signed by the Ministry of Culture to establish
the first Jewish cultural center in the Soviet Union in more than 50
years says the building may be used for classes in Hebrew and
Yiddish, Steinberg said.
   A working knowledge of Hebrew is considered an essential part of
the religious instruction given to every Jew, but Soviet laws now on
the books bar the private teaching of religious subjects to anyone
under 18.
   A new, more liberalized law regulating the practice of religion
in the Soviet Union is now in the works, and is expected to ease
some of the current constraints on proselytizing and worship.
   Steinberg said no Soviet Jew has been jailed recently for the
unsanctioned teaching of Hebrew.
   But the cultural ministry's statement of intent in an Oct. 21
agreement with Australian Jewish leaders, was the first known
written commitment by Soviet officials to an easing of constraints
on Hebrew-language instruction.

   President Reagan campaigned for George Bush and
the Republican ticket in the crucial Midwest today, urging voters to
reject ``far-out liberalism'' in the election next Tuesday.
   Speaking at a $150-per-person fund-raising brunch for Senate
candidate Susan Engeleiter, the president noted her support of the
death penalty.
   Reagan said Dukakis and the Democratic candidate for the Senate
from Wisconsin, Milwaukee Bucks owner Herbert Kohl, ``both say that,
no matter how horrible and brutal the crime, they're opposed to
capital punishment.''
   ``George Bush and Susan Engeleiter believe that for the most
horrible crimes, like when a drug dealer murders a policeman in cold
blood, that kind of killer deserves and should receive the death
sentence,'' the president said.
   Reagan noted that Mrs. Engeleiter, 36, would be the only mother
with growing children in the Senate if she is elected.
   ``I believe the Senate could use a mother's perspective, as
well,'' he said. Mrs. Engeleiter is in an uphill struggle against
Kohl for the right to replace retiring Sen. William Proxmire.
   ``I am here today to ask everyone in Wisconsin who plans to vote
for George Bush and against far-out liberalism in the White House to
also vote against far-out liberalism in the Congress,'' the
president said.
   In a speech prepared for delivery later at Baldwin Wallace
College in Berea, Ohio, the president urged Ohio voters to reject
the re-election bid of liberal Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, who leads
Cleveland's Republican Mayor George Voinovich in public opinion
polls.
   ``Now please, don't cancel out your vote for president by picking
a tax and spend liberal for the Senate,'' he said.
   The White House announced, meanwhile, that Reagan will extend his
campaigning through the weekend. Reagan will visit the Chicago area
and southern New Jersey on Friday and to Macomb County, Mich., and
the Dallas area on Saturday.
   On Tuesday, the president campaigned in California and in Nevada,
where he sought to bolster the re-election chances of Sen. Chic
Hecht, strongly challenged by Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan.
   At an airport rally in Reno, the president flayed Bryan and
Dukakis as ``tax-and-spend twins'' and said, ``I have to tell you
what a big mistake it would be for Nevada to send a jet set,
tax-and-spend liberal to Washington.''
   Bryan depicts himself as independent of the national Democratic
Party, supports military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels and is opposed
to the Equal Rights Amendment.
   The president sought to make a virtue of characteristics for
which Hecht, seldom heard in Senate debate, has been ridiculed by
his critics.
   `Chic doesn't grab headlines, he doesn't showboat,'' Reagan said.
``Chic's the kind of senator who doesn't make a lot of noise. He
just gets thing done for his state.''
   Reagan continued to strike out at Dukakis for telling audiences
that he is ``on your side.''
   ``Of course, the liberals now are saying that they're on your
side,'' he said. ``I guess they think that will make it easier for
them to reach their hand around and put it in your pocket.''

<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon purchased the air-launched
cruise missile knowing it did not perform as intended, a former
military official said in an interview published today.
   The weapon, billed as a low-flying, radar-evading missile, in
fact was not able to fly low enough to hide from enemy radar,
retired Air Force Lt. Col. Ronald F. Deady told the Antelope Valley
Press.
   Deady, who now lives in Lancaster, was a member of the Joint
Strategic Planning Staff at Strategic Air Command headquarters in
Omaha, Neb., from 1974 to 1978 and was among the officials who
monitored the missile's testing.
   ``The command approved it knowing that it did not fulfill
operational specifications,'' he said.
   An Air Force spokesman denied the charges, saying the missile
``met its stated purpose.''
   The Carter administration had chosen the cruise missile program
over the B-1 bomber to be one of the nation's main defense systems.
The missile can be armed with nuclear warheads.
   Deady, whose job at Edwards Air Force Base from 1978 to 1981 was
to ensure the missile was meeting military specifications, said he
found that tests were conducted in a way to make it appear the
missile worked properly.
   For instance, he said the missile was launched from B-52s flying
at altitudes that did not fit all operational profiles determined by
the Strategic Air Command.
   In addition, the missile was usually tested when the weather was
conducive for successful flights, he said.
   Deady said he complained to his superiors but got no response.
Colleagues advised him against pursuing the matter, he said, and he
took their advice and wrote favorable reports thereafter for the
sake of his career.
   ``The normal methods of delivery did not perform up to
operational specifications,'' he said. ``But when we turned a report
in, we did not say that it does not meet specifications. We said it
could.''
   However, Deady said he suspects the military in April 1983
reduced its missile orders from more than 3,000 to 1,715 because the
weapon could not adequately evade enemy defenses.
   The military has since moved on to another missile system, the
advanced cruise missile. Military officials denied the decision to
cancel orders was linked to the missile's performance.
   ``The ALCM met its stated purpose,'' said Ron Fry, a spokesman
for Air Force Logistics Command, which is responsible for approving
weapons systems before the service accepts them from contractors.
``But because of the new and evolving threat, the program was
redirected in favor of a more advanced weapons system.''
   Air-launched cruise missiles were delivered to the Air Force from
1982 through 1986. Fry said the missile, now stationed at bases in
seven states, is one of the most reliable weapons in the nation's
nuclear arsenal.

   Soviet military experts left
today after making their first spot inspection in Britain on the
progress of the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   The Soviets, who arrived Monday on 16 hours notice, inspected the
two U.S. cruise missile bases in Britain. One is at Greenham Common,
50 miles west of London, and the other is at Molesworth, 50 miles
north of the capital.
   Under the terms of the treaty, Soviet and American inspectors are
able to make 20 such short-notice ``challenge inspections'' within
the first five years, the Ministry of Defense said.
   Under the treaty, U.S. and Soviet officials agreed to eliminate
within three years land-based intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   The Soviet team checked Tuesday to see that all U.S. cruise
missiles had been removed from Molesworth. The last eight of the 16
missiles at the base were withdrawn a week ago and flown to the U.S.
Air Force base at Davis Monthan, Ariz., for destruction.
   On Monday, the Soviets visited Greenham Common, although none of
the 96 missiles there is scheduled for removal until late 1989.
   In July, Soviet military experts made a separate inspection of
the two bases to document the number of missiles and other equipment
in Britain.

   After two heart attacks and several scares, Jack
M. Deans five years ago wrote his own obituary. It ran this week.
   ``No one is better qualified to author this obituary than me,''
began the obituary, which appeared in both the Houston Chronicle and
The Houston Post on Tuesday.
   ``Don't be sorry you're reading about my earthly death,'' it
continued. ``I had it great all my life because of Christ and
Gladys.''
   On Oct. 3, after putting up the Halloween decorations at his
Bellaire home, Deans, 87, suffered another attack. He died in a coma
at a hospital Monday.
   Deans had also sketched plans for a funeral. It was to be
conducted by several of his friends, and Deans wanted it brief.
   Deans described himself in the obituary as ``a World War II
veteran, lumberman, Sunday School teacher and lay analytical
therapist for over 32 years, lecturer for 19 years at eight
universities in eight departments, author, Graphoanalyst, etc.''
   His wife, Gladys, said Deans never earned a college degree but
taught wood preservation at several area colleges and counseled an
estimated 4,000 people about marital and job problems, drugs and
teen-age difficulties.

because the condemned were under 18 when they committed the crimes.
   Judge Victor Famakinwa said Tuesday he will deliver the ruling on
a petition challenging the Nov. 14 sentences.
   The 12, whose ages were not given, were sentenced to death by
firing squad on June 22. Convicted armed robbers in Nigeria are shot

   State Attorney Eniola Fadayomi said Sunday the trial for the 12
had been fair. She also said the human rights organization Amnesty
International had asked the Nigerian government to spare the men.

   Officials of the Ghana Broadcasting Corp.
have suspended TV service and fired 19 workers and five trade union
officials for their alleged role in the assault of an announcer,
state radio reported.
   Police also arrested several of the corporation's workers for
``acts of intimidation and lawlessness'' after the assault on
Tuesday, Radio Ghana said.
   The radio did not explain the nature of the assault or disclose
the identity of the announcer. It also gave no explination why only
television, and not radio services were suspended or say how long
the suspension would last.
   A skeleton staff remained at the television section of the
broadcasting station while other employees were instructed to stay
at home and await instructions, the radio said.

   The Soviet Union would like a prompt summit meeting
with the new U.S. president to pursue arms control and other
discussions, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``We stand for preserving a sense of momentum in the top-level
Soviet-American dialogue, for it not to have artificial and
unnecessary pauses,'' said chief spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov.
   Gerasimov noted that both candidates have said they would like to
continue regular Soviet-American summit meetings.
   Gerasimov said his statement can be interpreted ``as the wish not
to delay for long a summit meeting with the new U.S. president.''

   A British soldier has died of injuries
suffered at the Ramstein air show disaster on Aug. 28, bringing the
death toll to 70, officials said Wednesday.
   The 40-year-old soldier, who was not identified, died over the
weekend in a hospital in Hanover, said Juergen Dietzen, a spokesman
for the Interior Ministry of Rhineland Palatinate state.
   Dietzen said 24 people remain hospitalized in 10 facilities, and
four are in critical condition.
   The accident occurred when three Italian stunt planes collided at
an annual air show at the Ramstein U.S. Air Force base. One of the
planes plunged into the crowd.
   Authorities gave the following nationality breakdown for the
dead: 60 West Germans, four Americans, one Dutch citizen, one French
citizen, the British soldier and the three Italian pilots.

   A Cabinet minister accused of drawing a
pistol during an argument with a woman has resigned, Radio Uganda
announced Wednesday.
   President Yoweri Museveni accepted the resignation of Internal
Affairs Minister Kahinda Otafiire ``because the National Resistance
Movement government will not tolerate any indiscipline displayed by
anybody regardless of his position, such as shown by Otafiire,'' the
state-owned radio said.
   Otafiire was responsible for prisons, police and immigration
departments. Radio Uganda did not say if he had been asked to resign.
   The government-owned newspaper New Vision reported Wednesday that
Otafiire argued with Jennifer Kuteesa at Fairway Hotel in Kampala,
Uganda's capital, on Oct. 15. Mrs. Kuteesa said she thought the
matter was over until police began investigating the incident.
   Otafiire was among those who joined Museveni in 1981 to form the
National Resistance Movement, the political wing of the National
Resistance Army. Museveni recently made Otafiire an honorarly army
colonel.

<HEAD>British Movie Industry Throws Palace Party To Honor The Oscar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAMPTON COURT, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a setting Hollywood would find
hard to match, the British movie industry threw a party in a palace
with a princess and some of the greatest names in show business to
honor the 60th anniversary of the Oscar.
   The champagne reception Tuesday night for 400 guests at Hampton
Court Palace was in the bedroom where King Henry VIII's wives slept,
and dinner was served in the ornate Great Hall that Henry was in
such a rush to finish that he had laborers working on it at night by
candlelight.
   Princess Anne, president of the British Academy of Film and
Television Arts, said of the palace: ``It has seen many real life
dramas that even the film world would find difficult to dramatize.''
   Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young, who praised the
innovation in the American cinema, jokingly chided the princess: ``I
was hoping our American friends could go back thinking this was a
set specifically built by BAFTA for them.''
   Two movies _ ``The Private Life of Henry VIII'' in 1933 and ``A
Man For All Seasons'' in 1965 _ used the exterior of the palace 12
miles southwest of London as the setting, although crews were not
allowed inside.
   ``They don't allow people to film here at all _ not
commercially,'' said Ian Gray, superintendent of the palace.
``That's because it's a royal palace like Windsor or Buckingham
Palace and it's not considered appropriate to have any commercial
activities.''
   The dinner celebrated the close ties between the British and
American film industries and marked the first time the American
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been honored abroad,
said Bob Rehme, an Academy vice president.
   More than 200 Britons have won Oscars and about 80 of them
attended the dinner, including actors Ben Kingsley, Peter Ustinov,
Sir John Mills and Olivia De Havilland, and directors Sir Richard
Attenborough, David Puttnam and David Lean.
   Richard Kahn, president of the American Academy, said the
recognition of British filmmakers in the United States started with
the first ever Oscar awards, when Charlie Chaplin was voted a
special award, and has been ``nothing short of phenomenal.''
   ``This dinner is a fitting capstone to Oscar's 60th year,'' Kahn
said. ``The luster of Oscar is growing... Its radiance is due in no
small measure to the Oscar laureates in this room tonight.''
   He presented Princess Anne with a replica of an Oscar to be
displayed at BAFTA, saying: ``I would like the Princess Royal to
adopt this fellow as a loyal son of the realm.''
   Mills, one of Britain's actor-knights and winner of the best
supporting actor award in 1970 for ``Ryan's Daughter,'' said he was
somewhat astonished to realize that his 59 year-career was just one
year less than the span of the Academy Awards.
   Of all the honors he has received in his career, the 80-year-old
Mills said of his Oscar: ``It's the top. I think it always has
tremendous glamour.''
   Ustinov, winner of best supporting actor roles for ``Spartacus''
in 1960 and ``Topkapi'' in 1964, said the British and American film
industries had always been important to each other.
   ``I think their outlook is sometimes very different and I would
encourage that difference because it's more important than if they
think the same way,'' Ustinov said.
   Kingsley, winner of the best actor award in 1982 for the title
role in ``Gandhi,'' echoed this, saying: ``Europe and America
grafted together the energy of the new world and the craftsmanship
of the old world which I hope will go on and on and which makes this
evening very genuine.''
   Asked why so many Britons had won Oscars, Kingsley quipped: ``We
are a talented race _ but surely it would have to do with British
actors speaking the same language as the American audience.''
   Olivia De Havilland said the American love affair with British
actors dates back to the 1930s and 1940s. ``When I arrived in
Hollywood all the legendary favorites were British. My favorite was
Ronald Coleman ... There was one British artist after another and
they set the tone.''
   Many of the Oscar winners who weren't able to attend _ Bob Hope,
Michael Caine, Julie Andrews, Joan Fontaine and others _ will be
seen in a British TV documentary titled ``The British and the
Oscars,'' to be shown in Britain on Dec. 29.

<HEAD>Dukakis Suddenly Connecting as Campaign Nears End</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hall was packed with union-label Democrats
who cheered themselves hoarse as Michael Dukakis threw them the kind
of political rhetoric his partisans have waited to hear.
   ``Hard workers, not high rollers built this country.''
   ``I picked Lloyd Bentsen (loud cheers); he picked Dan Quayle (a
torrent of boos) and that tells you everything you want to know.
...''
   ``As your president, I'm not going to be standing up for sharp
operators, I'm going to be standing up for lathe operators and
machine operators.''
   ``There's a lot of talk about labels in this campaign. The label
I care about, the label you care about, the label the American
people care about is the label, `Made in America.'''
   At each of these sallies and others, people leapt to their feet
and held their red, white and blue signs high above their heads and
cheered and chanted, ``Duke, Duke, Duke.''
   Could it be? Was dull, passionless Michael Dukakis turning on a
crowd?
   Indeed, he was. Suddenly, in the closing days of the presidential
campaign, the underdog Democratic nominee seemed to have discovered
some magic.
   He was, in the jargon of politics, making contact with his
audiences.
   His words were stronger, his phrases sharper _ after all these
months, Dukakis had found his message.
   It was a mix of Populism and indignation, often an effective
combination for Democratic candidates.
   With time running out and the national polls still showing
Republican George Bush with a steady lead, Dukakis is drawing big
crowds and his aides are talking about closing the gap.
   ``This race is tightening up,'' the candidate tells every rally.
``You can sense it, you can feel it, you can taste it.''
   What Dukakis was feeling and tasting at these buoyant events
could also be merely a phenomenon common in national campaigns. Call
it the closing days euphoria.
   For the loser as well as the winner, the crowds get bigger and
more enthusiastic.
   Walter F. Mondale drew huge crowds in the closing days of the
1984 campaign and he, too, detected a surge he predicted would prove
the pollsters wrong. He made that prediction the day before he lost
49 states.
   Politicians in eastern Washington still recall a massive turnout
in 1972 for George McGovern, a crowd they now speculate included
every single person in the state of Washington who ended up voting
for that Democratic landslide loser.
   Dukakis is given a far better chance than anyone ever gave
McGovern or Mondale to fool the pollsters. But an underdog he
remains.
   For months he appeared to be a candidate in search of a message,
a candidate constantly ducking and dodging the attacks of the
opposition, failing to come up with an effective response.
   In recent weeks that began to change. The Populist message
emerged and he began to make the Bush negative commercials a
campaign issue.
   He even took on the dreaded ``L'' word.
   ``Yes, I'm a liberal in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt,
Harry Truman and John Kennedy,'' he told a rally in Bakersfield,
Calif.
   A liberal he is, but he obviously remains uncomfortable with the
tag.
   ``I'm not a label,'' he kept telling questioners who wanted to
know why he had so avoided the term earlier and had allowed Bush to
define it in derogatory fashion.
   But in the Milwaukee Exhibition and Convention Center, it all
seemed to come together.
   He was helped by the crowd and also by a series of speakers who
said many of the things Democrats had been wanting to hear from
their presidential candidate.
   ``There are two candidates;, how do you decide?'' asked Sen.
William Proxmire.
   ``You vote for the man on your side,'' he said in response to his
own question.
   After more than 30 years in the Senate, Proxmire is retiring,
having made his mark as a watchdog of government spending, the man
who regularly announced his ``Golden Fleece'' awards to government
officials, departments or agencies he deemed responsible for
particularly outrageous wastes of public money.
   ``There would be no `Golden Fleeces' for a Dukakis
administration,'' said the senator. ``How could I give a `Golden
Fleece' to a man who mows his own lawn?''

   Even before he met his friends hurrying
down the dark, icy streets for the start of the 6 a.m. shift
Wednesday at the Lenin shipyard, Piotr Gawor knew what the
government's decision to shut the yard meant.
   ``We are going to be unemployed. I don't believe their offer of
new jobs,'' the 17-year-old carpenter said.
   Like most of the thousands of workers returning to work after a
four-day holiday, Gawor only learned he would lose his job when the
decision to liquidate the shipyard on grounds of economic
inefficiency was announced on the evening news Monday.
   The closure due to begin Dec. 1 has left workers bitter and
afraid, not only for their jobs but for the future of talks between
authorities and the opposition. The talks _ originally planned for
mid-October _ were to consider the future of the banned Solidarity
trade union, which was born in the yard in August 1980.
   Much of the workers' anger was directed at Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski, a longtime foe of Solidarity who was named prime minister
Sept. 27 after the previous government collapsed over its failure to
carry out economic reform.
   ``It's Rakowski's policy. He was in the shipyard in 1983 swearing
at people. The round table (talks) didn't take place and it is all
thanks to him,'' said Krystana Burant, a crane operator who has
worked at the yard for 20 years.
   The official press said the decision to shut the yard was made by
Rakowski, and many workers see the move as Rakowski's revenge for a
1983 meeting at the shipyard where workers booed and whistled at him.
   That appearance by Rakowski, then deputy prime minsiter, was to
defend the authorities' 1981 imposition of martial law. It has left
a deep impression on workers, who have not forgotten Rakowski's
attempts to humiliate their leader, Lech Walesa.
   Meeting Rakowski for the first time since he was released from
internment following the Dec. 13, 1981, military crackdown, Walesa
was allowed to criticize the government but not permitted to rebut
Rakowski's reply.
   ``We should have just hung (Rakowski) then with his tie. He's
just making a career, while we workers suffer,''' said one
middle-aged worker who declined to give his name.
   Workers say they are not convinced of the government's argument
that the yard must be closed as part of economic restructuring.
   ``There are so many other enterprises which are more
unprofitable. These still exist, and they are closing ours,'' said
an assembly worker.
   Some workers grumbled they should just go out on strike in
protest, while others felt the action would play into the hands of a
government they feel wants to portray Solidarity as anti-reform.
Still others thought they could win little now by striking.
   ``I heard there will be a strike in the yard. But if there is a
strike, they will just lock us up in jail,'' said Barant.
   Workers do not believe the government will succeed in squelching
support for Solidarity by shutting the yard.
   ``Solidarity is like a tree. It has its roots here. And they
think that if they cut off the roots, Solidarity will collapse. But
it is not true,'' said another worker, not giving his name.
   For the time being, Solidarity and the official trade union OPZZ
have decided to work together to fight the closure in an unusual
alliance that reverses Solidarity's former policy of
non-fraternization with the OPZZ. The official union federation was
created to replace Solidarity after it was outlawed in 1982.
   The government has said that the shipyard workers will have
30,000 jobs in the Gdansk area to choose from after the yard is
closed. But some workers still don't believe the yard will shut down
at all.
   ``It's just rumors. We worked here and we are going to stay here.
Besides I have to stay, because otherwise they are going to steal
everything,'' said a grizzled security guard at the gate as the rest
of the dispirited crew was walking in to work.

<TEXT>
   The first edition of an independent
literary and social periodical conceived 10 years ago appeared
Wednesday in Budapest under the direction of a writer once out of
favor with the communist authorities.
   The fortnightly Hitel, which means Credit, has a print run of
20,000. Its editors say it is independent, although it has ties to
the Hungarian Democratic Forum, an unofficial movement for democracy.
   At a price of about 75 cents, it is to be self-financing, leaders
of the Forum have said. The journal bears the name ``credit''
because it hopes to win credit from readers who trust it, according
to Editor Sando Csoori.
   Csoori, an active member of the Forum, said in his first
editorial the idea for Hitel was born 10 years ago. But the
communist leadership, then under Janos Kadar, was suspicious and
perceived the organizers as representing a
``populist-national-radical trend,'' Csoori wrote.
   ``Ten years and a quiet change in the power (strucuture) had to
pass before we could come out with the first issue of Hitel at long
last,'' Csoori wrote.
   Premier Karoly Grosz took over from Kadar as Communist Party
leader in May following a reshuffle that brought reformers into the
leadership.
   In the past year, there has been a growth of independent groups
and movements. Another independent magazine, Reform, came out for
the first time in September.
   The once-banned writer Istvan Csurka was among the contributors
to the 64-page first issue of Hitel. He wrote about a banned
demonstration Oct. 23 to mark the anniversary of the start of the
1956 anti-communist uprising.
   Other articles examined constitutional reform, national
self-awareness and a demonstration in September that saw 10,000
people chant calls for democracy and a multiparty system outside
parliament.
   ``Hitel appears in a difficult and inauspicious historical
moment,'' Csoori wrote. ``All Hungarian society is in motion ... so
drab and gray and undivided for such a long time, ... this is the
time of moral revision and recovery.''

   The outlawed Solidarity trade federation
today reversed a longstanding policy and agreed to work with the
government-approved union in an effort to save the Lenin shipyard.
   The announcement was made by Lech Walesa, leader of Solidarity,
which was founded at the shipyard. He spoke at an outdoor rally
attended by nearly all the yard's 10,000 workers on the first
working day since the government announced Monday that it will close
the shipyard on Dec. 1.
   Walesa appeared to rule out a strike for the moment, saying:
``That would only make the situation worse.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher arrived in Poland today
on a three-day visit that will include a trip to a monument outside
the yard on Friday. Solidarity leaders said they were eager to avoid
creating a confrontation that could jeopardize the visit, the first
to Poland by a British prime minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher's visit could give government officials a chance to
justify their hard-line treatment of Solidarity by pointing to her
success in subduing unions in Britain. The government also hopes the
visit will pave the way for Western credits to help the country's
debt-plagued economy.
   Walesa said he told the official OPZZ union that Solidarity
planned to fight to save the shipyard, and he proposed the two
unions suspend their disagreements to work together.
   ``We adopted a common position which is proof the unions can
reach agreement at any moment provided we are not set against each
other by someone else,'' Walesa said.
   The joint resolution marks a reversal of Solidarity's earlier
position not to talk to the official union, which was set up in 1982
after the martial-law crackdown on Solidarity.
   Although the official union continues to oppose introduction of
union pluralism _ saying it alone can best represent all workers _
hostility between the OPZZ and Solidarity has been diminishing. On
the factory floor, the two groups have been known to cooperate on
local issues.
   ``This is for the first time that OPZZ and Solidarity have
declared cooperation so publicly and so officially, although not 100
percent of unionists are ready to defend the shipyard at any cost,''
said Franciszek Ciemny, national spokesman for the OPZZ.
   He said national OPZZ leaders today endorsed the government's
motives to reform the economy, but decided the shipyard should not
be closed abruptly.
   It asked for a meeting with government officials Nov. 9 to press
for improved shipyard efficiency, Ciemny said.
   The shipyard workers have agreed to rally at 9 a.m. every Tuesday
until the closure decision is reversed.
   Walesa said he believes Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski's
decision to close the shipyard has ended hopes that proposed talks
between authorities and the opposition on Poland's future can begin
soon.
   ``At this moment it is losing sense,'' he said. ``On the one hand
you are trying to talk about various subjects, and on the other hand
you close the cradle of Solidarity and Walesa's workplace. It
doesn't make sense.''
   At the rally, management encouraged workers to take up tools and
work peaceably. The thousands of workers who braved icy wind to
report for 6 a.m. shift appeared willing to follow the advice.
   ``Just the way we fight beautifully and sing beautifully, we are
going to work beautifully,'' Walesa said. ``I am proud that the
shipyard is working so nicely.''
   The government said Monday that the shipyard was a money-losing
operation and it would be closed. The move was viewed widely as a
slap at Solidarity and Walesa at a time authorities are ostensibly
seeking dialogue with the opposition at proposed talks on Poland's
future.
   Official figures show that at least one area shipyard is losing
more money than the Lenin yard, the first major industrial
enterprise the government has announced it will close in a bid to
revive Poland's crippled economy.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, speaking on television Tuesday,
said: ``Deep economic reforms in Poland ... cannot be made mildly
and without conflicts.''
   The government suggested the closure was similar to economic
actions taken by Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party government.
   ``Her beginning at the steering wheel was similar _ inflation,
social tensions, outdated, uncompetitive industry and stagnation,''
state television said. ``But she overcame the crisis, often through
unpopular means against the interests of significant groups.''
   Solidarity was launched at the Lenin shipyard during nationwide
strikes in August 1980 and was chartered by the government that
fall, becoming the only independent labor movement ever allowed in
the Soviet bloc.
   It developed as Poland's main political opposition but was
crushed in a December 1981 military crackdown and subsequently
outlawed by Parliament.

<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda, re-elected to his
sixth term last week, on Wednesday announced a smaller Cabinet and
promised sweeping economic reforms.
   Kaunda, 64, who led the British colony of Northern Rhodesia to
independence as the nation of Zambia on Oct. 24, 1964, reduced the
previous 22-member Cabinet to 16.
   The president, holding his first news conference since being
installed as head of state on Monday, dubbed it a ``budget-cutting
Cabinet.''
   While the move met Western donors' demands for cuts in state
spending in return for aid to help his ailing economy, Kaunda also
named 22 ministers of state to assist the Cabinet. Cabinet ministers
who were dropped from the previous government won posts as ministers
of state.
   Zambia is burdened by record unemployment, galloping inflation
and a foreign debt of $4 billion that drains 40 percent of export
income. Most of those earnings have come from exports of copper.
   Among the state ministers were his son, Wezi, who has been
mentioned as a possible successor.
   Kawnda said the new Cabinet's main task would be to carry out
economic reforms now that he is armed with a mandate from the 2.6
million voters in his land of 7 million people.
   Kaunda last year abandoned an International Monetary
Fund-prescribed recovery program after 15 people were killed in
rioting over a doubling of food prices. That move held down prices,
but most Western aid donors withdrew all aid until he accepted
harsher measures to straighten out the economy.
   He said he hoped the IMF would resume relations with his country
once the economy was restructured.
   Kaunda also announced that the country's international and
domestic airports would be privatized. Party insiders said they
expect further privatization of state corporations that cost the
government tens of millions of dollars in subsidies every year.

   Space Shuttle Atlantis was moved to
the launch pad Wednesday for a flight late this month in which the
crew will deploy a Pentagon intelligence-gathering satellite and try
to determine man's role as a military observer in orbit.
   Perched vertically atop a huge transporter with a tank-like
tread, Atlantis headed out of an assembly building into the darkness
shortly after 1 a.m., completing the snail's-pace, four-mile trip
seven hours later at Launch Pad 39B.
   The move, befitting the classified nature of the mission, was
made without the floodlights, music, speeches and cheers of
thousands of workers who showed up when Discovery rolled to the pad
July 4 for the first shuttle mission since the 1986 Challenger
explosion that killed seven astronauts.
   Discovery returned Americans to space Sept. 29 and successfully
completed its mission four days later.
   Conrad Nagel, Atlantis' processing director, said NASA was aiming
for a launch Nov. 28 or 29. A firm date won't be set until after a
flight readiness review Nov. 16.
   Nagel's team began readying Atlantis in March 1987 for its third
journey into space, making more than 200 modifications to improve
the spacecraft's safety and performance.
   ``We are simply clean as far as any technical problems,'' he told
reporters Wednesday.
   Atlantis will have a crew of five, headed by Navy Cmdr. Robert
Gibson. The others are Air Force Lt. Col. Guy Gardner, Air Force Lt.
Col. Jerry Ross, Air Force Col. Richard Mullane and Navy Cmdr.
William Shepherd.
   The astronauts will deploy a satellite, believed to carry
instruments to intercept electronic signals and verify arms control
agreements, and conduct other experiments of a military nature.
   The Air Force has been planning several experiments for upcoming
shuttle flights to determine the utility of astronauts for strategic
reconnaissance, surveillance of Soviet naval forces and other
operational military objectives.
   The tests will be coordinated with with ground exercises,
including troop maneuvers, naval movements and ballistic missile
launches. It is not known publicly which of the exercises will be
conducted on the upcoming mission because the Defense Department has
thrown a cloak of secrecy over most details.
   Officials have said the launch will occur between 6:32 a.m. and
9:32 a.m., but the time won't be made public until the countdown
reaches nine minutes before liftoff.
   Once Atlantis is safely in orbit, there will be a news blackout,
except for a brief announcement every 24 hours saying the shuttle is
still up there. That plan will be broken only if something serious
goes wrong. Sixteen hours' advance notice will be given of the
landing.
   Two more Defense Department shuttle flights and seven unmanned
Titan launches are planned in the next year as the Pentagon aims to
start moving into space a backlog of more than 20 payloads grounded
by the Challenger accident and the explosion of a Titan rocket three
months later.

<HEAD>Curfew Imposed Before Sinhalese Strike</HEAD>

   The government imposed a nationwide
nighttime curfew Wednesday after attacks by radical Sinhalese left
at least 16 people dead. The radicals called a strike and threatened
to kill all who defied it.
   Security forces were put on maximum alert in preparation for
Thursday's strike, called by the People's Liberation Front.
   State radio said the curfew would be in effect from 11 p.m. to 4
a.m.
   Attackers believed to be Sinhalese radicals hurled a bomb into a
home in the southern coast town of Tangalle overnight, killing seven
members of a family, police said.
   In another attack also blamed on the People's Liberation Front,
five policemen were injured by a homemade landmine in the northern
part of the island, the military command said.
   The front has vowed to kill supporters of an accord aimed at
ending the war by minority Tamils, who want more autonomy. Radical
Sinhalese believe the accord makes too many concessions to the
Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the nation's 16 million people.
   The Sinhalese-dominated government has blamed the front for the
assassinations of more than 500 people since the accord was signed
15 months ago.
   On Wednesday, the radical group told one of the largest
government-run newspapers, the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon
Limited, and a communist-run daily to stop publication from Thursday
or face its wrath.
   The warning issued through leaflets in Colombo also threatened
with death those who disobeyed its directive.
   The managements of the two newspapers were not immediately
available for comment.
   The front claimed responsibility for a raid Tuesday on the
Pannala army base 30 miles northeast of Colombo. The government said
nine people died in the attack _ four soldiers, four attackers and
one civilian.
   In Tangalle, 70 miles southeast of Colombo, police said they had
little information about the bomb deaths of the seven civilians.
However, a senior police official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the family may have been suspected of passing
information about front members to police.
   The mine explosion occurred at Eppawala, 92 miles northeast of
Colombo while police were removing anti-government posters,
according to a spokesman for the military command in Colombo. He
said the People's Liberation Front was thought to be responsible for
the explosion.
   The front has been at the vanguard of a Sinhalese backlash the
1987 accord, which was signed by the leaders of Sri Lanka and India.
India, Sri Lanka's northern neighbor with a large Tamil population
of its own, mediated the accord.
   The accord would grant a measure of autonomy to Tamils if the
guerrillas lay down their arms. The largest Tamil rebel group has
refused to accept the accord.
   Tamils say they need a separate homeland to combat what they say
is discrimination in educations and jobs. Sinhalese, who account for
75 percent of the population, hold most top government and military
offices.

<HEAD>In Tight Florida Senate Race, Underdog Democrat Backs Away From
Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every time Republican Senate candidate Connie Mack
hits television viewers with one of his ``Hey Buddy, You're
Liberal!'' commercials, Democratic rival Buddy MacKay winces and
moves a little further away from Michael Dukakis.
   ``I'm in the Lloyd Bentsen wing of the Democratic Party,'' he
says. ``Michael Dukakis is speaking for Michael Dukakis, not Buddy
MacKay.''
   The ghostly image of the Democratic presidential nominee as a
big-spending liberal is giving MacKay the shivers and stirring
Mack's hopes of squeaking through to an election victory next
Tuesday in one of the most closely fought Senate battles in the
nation.
   The tightness of the race to succeed popular Democratic Sen.
Lawton Chiles, who is retiring after three terms, could test the
strength of Republican presidential nominee George Bush's coattails.
   Recent polls give the vice president a double-digit lead over
Dukakis among Florida voters _ up to 27 percentage points in one
survey _ but indicate that the contest between Mack and MacKay, both
of them six-year House veterans, is too close to call.
   Although Democrats have a 3-to-2 edge among registered voters,
ticket-splitting is a recent phenomenon in Florida, and the Mack
campaign has been trying to gain a boost from Bush's popularity.
   One TV ad shows Bush urging Floridians to send Mack to the Senate
to help him as president. Another features a film clip of the vice
president telling the GOP National Convention to ``read my lips _ no
new taxes.''
   A third commercial says Dukakis and MacKay stand together on
defense issues and opposing aid for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
and concludes: ``Hey Buddy and Mike, You're Liberal.''
   Mack says he represents the same Florida conservatives who gave
Ronald Reagan lopsided victories in 1980 and 1984, and boasts that
he will be able to pick up the telephone and talk personally to the
president if Bush is elected.
   MacKay responds by embracing vice presidential nominee Bentsen,
the moderate Texas senator, and keeping Dukakis at arm's length.
   He tells crime-conscious Floridians that he supports the death
penalty for drug-related murders. Dukakis opposes capital punishment.
   Like Dukakis, MacKay says he opposes the B-1 bomber and other
defense programs he regards as costly boondoggles but favors a
strong military. He says he would consider higher taxes only on such
excise levies as cigarettes and liquor.
   He calls himself a Southern moderate-to-conservative in the mold
of Chiles and Sens. Albert Gore of Tennessee, Sam Nunn of Georgia
and Bob Graham of Florida, all of whom have campaigned for MacKay.
   Graham warns Floridians that they will lose clout in the Senate
if they elect ``an ideological wacko'' like Mack.
   Mack, 48, repeats the mantra of ``less taxes, less government,
less spending _ more freedom'' at every opportunity. MacKay charges
that his opponent votes ``a bizarre ideological agenda that is
anti-Florida'' and offensive to environmentalists and the elderly.
   The two candidates entered Congress together in 1982 with
dramatically different styles, philosophies and backgrounds.
   MacKay, 55, whose country boy look belies his affluence as the
son of a Central Florida land-owning family, spent 12 years in the
state Legislature and lost a 1980 bid for the Democratic Senate
nomination. One of the most highly respected politicians in Florida
for years, he was heartily endorsed this year by nearly all the
state's daily newspapers.
   MacKay was preparing for a 1990 bid for the governorship when
former two-term Gov. Reubin Askew declared himself fed up with the
time required for fund raising and on May 7 dropped out of a Senate
race that was considered his.
   MacKay, relying on a dedicated cadre of volunteers, came from
behind to gain a runoff election against state Insurance
Commissioner Bill Gunter, whom MacKay defeated for the Democratic
nomination on Oct. 4.
   Connie Mack bears the name of his grandfather, the famed manager
of the Philadelphia Athletics baseball team who adopted a nickname
in place of his real name, Cornelius McGillicuddy.
   The placid, telegenic Mack was born in Philadelphia and moved to
Florida with his family in 1951. He became a bank president in the
small southwest Gulf Coast town of Cape Coral. Like Reagan, Mack
says he is a former liberal Democrat whose views evolved into GOP
conservatism. He says it was Reagan's 1980 election that inspired
him to enter politics.
   He won in 1982 and was easily re-elected twice. In the House, he
is a member of the Republican band of young conservative activists
led by Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia. When national GOP leaders
urged him to challenge Chiles, Mack left Rep. Jack Kemp's
presidential campaign team to enter the Senate race in October 1987.
   Although MacKay has a moderate record, he's undoubtedly too
liberal for Mack, who has one of the most conservative records in
Congress. Mack has been host of fund-raising appearances by Reagan
and Iran-Contra figure Oliver North.
   He refused to debate his primary opponent, former U.S. Attorney
Robert Merkle, who carried a life-size cutout called ``Cardboard
Connie'' and derided his foe as an intellectual lightweight.
   When Mack won the primary with 62 percent of the vote, Merkle
didn't endorse him but promised only that he wouldn't oppose him.
Meanwhile, Gunter eased Democratic fears of a divided party by
campaigning for MacKay.

   A Polish airliner making an emergency
landing went out of control and crashed into a field Wednesday,
killing one passenger and injuring 15, officials said.
   The LOT airliner, with 25 passengers and four crewmembers, went
down in the village of Bialabrzegi, about 170 miles southeast of
Warsaw, according to the official PAP news agency.
   Police Capt. Jerzy Pacula said most of the injuries were minor.
Authorities said five people were hospitalized and at least 10
others were treated and released.
   Pacula said the Soviet-made Antonov 24 plane apparently had
mechanical problems and the pilot was moments from making an
emergency landing when he lost control and crashed in the empty
field. Pacula spoke by telephone from police headquarters in
Rzeszow, near the crash site.
   PAP said the pilot's actions averted a greater disaster.
   ``The pilot managed to land the machine on its belly on a flat
field and the maneuver, performed in a masterly way, saved the lives
of the passengers,'' PAP said.
   Pacula said the pilot was slightly injured and aided in rescue
operations.
   The twin-engine turboprop was on a flight from Warsaw to the city
of Rzeszow.
   A doctor at a hospital in the town of Lancut said the facility
treated 13 people from the crash and hospitalized three of them in
serious condition. The others were discharged. Pacula said another
two people were hospitalized in Rzeszow.
   PAP said one of the passengers hospitalized was British, but he
offered no other identification.
   Poland's worst air disaster occurred May 9, 1987, when a
Soviet-built Ilyushin-62M jetliner on a LOT flight to New York
crashed outside Warsaw after one engine broke apart. It killed 183
people.

   Police trying to figure out how Ronald Sayles
could have committed a moving violation while he supposedly was
behind bars realized he and his twin have been sharing the same
driver's license number.
   Reginald and Ronald Sayles, 20, have 15 traffic tickets between
them on the same license number, according to Champaign County
Court's traffic division.
   Reginald was arrested and charged Sept. 17 with drunken driving
and leaving the scene of an accident. He had nearly completed his
two-week jail term when police discovered he had given officers
Ronald's name and identification.
   The scheme began unraveling last week when new traffic charges
were filed against Ronald. Sheriff's deputies wondered how he had
managed a moving violation while in jail.
   Criminal records supervisor Isabelle Ober obtained a fingerprint
check and on Friday, jailers paid Reginald a visit. ``He just kind
of grinned at us,'' Ober said.
   Drivers are issued a 12-digit number that encodes the motorist's
sex, date of birth and last name.
   Mike Lawrence, a spokesman for Secretary of State Jim Edgar, said
the state employees who issue license numbers usually get a computer
signal that flags duplicate numbers. But, he said, the employee
apparently ignored the signal.

   Leftist rebels killed six
soldiers today in attacks on an army post and a bridge, authorities
said. The assaults came one day after a mortar attack on the
National Guard headquarters.
   The army post attacked today was guarding a sugar refinery.
   ``They attacked us with mortars and rifle fire ... damaged the
offices and killed four soldiers ... and wounded four others,'' said
the head of security at the refinery who identified himself as Sgt.
Sandoval.
   He said the attack began shortly after midnight and lasted
several hours.
   About the same time, rebels attacked national guardsmen at the
Las Canas bridge just north of San Salvador, military sources said.
Two guardsmen were killed and several guerrillas wounded in the
30-minute attack, they said.
   Four soldiers were killed and 37 wounded in the attack on the
National Guard headquarters Tuesday. Two guard barracks were
destroyed.
   The guerrillas' clandestine Radio Venceremos called Tuesday's
attack in the northern part of this capital a ``welcome'' to Col.
Rene Emilio Ponce on the first day of his new job as military chief
of staff.
   National Guard commander Col. Jose Humberto Gomez suffered a
shrapnel wound to a leg, and eight guardsmen were reported in
critical condition, a defense ministry spokesman said. Seven
civilians also were wounded.
   One of two parked cars packed with explosives about a block from
the base exploded during the 45-minute attack Tuesday, damaging
nearby vehicles and homes. Army munitions experts de-activated
explosives in the other car.
   Rebel mortar fire set off grenades stored inside the main
building at the compound and panicked residents of the poor,
working-class neighborhood that surrounds the site.
   National Guard officers at the site said they believed the 81mm
mortars were launched from La Lomita, a hillock about 530 yards east
of the compound.
   Deputy Public Security Minister Col. Leopoldo Hernandez said the
salvo destroyed two guard barracks.
   Col. Ponce said the attack was carried out by urban commandos of
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the umbrella group of
five leftist guerrilla organizations.
   Ponce said about 15 rebels participated in the attack, which he
described as being staged for ``propagandistic'' purposes.
   Hernandez said the surprise attack ``doesn't mean there was
neglect by the security forces or the National Guard. What happened
is, there isn't any way to stop a mortar attack.''
   The guard forms part of El Salvador's armed forces and
participates in counterinsurgency operations.
   Radio Venceremos, in a statement received in Mexico City, said
rebels attacked a prison and blew up an electricity substation in
Sensuntepeque, 50 miles northeast of San Salvador.
   Military sources confirmed rebels attacked the prison there for
four hours Monday night, but there were no injuries or escapes.
   In another statement, Venceremos said army forces suffered 479
casualties, including dead and wounded, in combat during October. It
did not provide a breakdown or a rebel casualty figure.
   It said the guerrillas were stepping up the urban war in an
offensive called ``Death to Reagan's Policy, Yankees Out of El
Salvador.''
   The attacks came as guerrilla leaders embarked on a tour to brief
Latin American leaders on the possibility of resuming peace talks
with the government.
   Front commanders Leonel Gonzalez and Joaquin Villalobos met
Monday in Panama City with Roman Catholic archbishop Arturo Rivera
Damas, who said he presented a report on proposals for a negotiated
end to the 9-year conflict that has claimed 65,000 lives.
   Rivera Damas declined to elaborate.
   Salvadoran church leaders have mediated the few meetings between
the government and rebels. The last meeting was Oct. 20, 1987, in
San Salvador.
   Meanwhile, negotiations continued late Tuesday with inmates
holding at least three hostages at a prison in Quezaltepeque, 15
miles north of San Salvador.
   Six inmates there demanded political asylum in Mexico in exchange
for the hostages' release, a prison official said.
   One inmate yelled out a window to reporters that his group was
holding 12 hostages. Clutching a pistol and a grenade, he threatened
to amputate their arms and legs if the asylum demands were not met.
   Col. Miguel Vasconcelos, commander of the army brigade that has
surrounded the prison, said the hostage-taking incident began Monday
night when prisoners jumped two guards and took their rifles.

<HEAD>Administration Calls Drug Tests Vital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration told the Supreme
Court today that mandatory drug tests for some railroad workers and
U.S. Customs Service employees are vital to public safety and
confidence in government.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in an unusual move, appeared
himself to plead for testing of rail workers after train accidents.
   ``This is a case about railway safety,'' he said. It is about
``the hazards created by use of drugs and alcohol by those in charge
of trains.''
   Solicitor General Charles Fried, the administration's top
courtroom lawyer, defended the Customs Service drug testing program.
   ``There is rather special, urgent and symbolic significance'' in
assuring the public that the agency responsible for preventing drug
smuggling has a drug-free work force, Fried said.
   ``The Customs Service is indeed entitled to take a fine filter to
show to itself, its workers and the public that (workers) are not
involved in drug use,'' he said.
   The drug tests were attacked as a ``humiliating invasion of
privacy'' by Lois Williams, representing the Customs Service workers.
   ``Innocent persons have a great deal of reason to be
apprehensive,'' she said.
   Lawrence Mann, an attorney for the railway workers, said the drug
tests are unconstitutional because they are incapable of proving
on-the-job impairment.
   ``Neither the alcohol nor the drug test can demonstrate
impairment,'' he said. The tests can show the presence of a residue
from a drug that may have been taken by ``someone 60 days ago in the
privacy of home.''
   The two cases will provide a crucial test for mandatory drug
testing in the American workplace.
   Thornburgh's appearance underscored the importance of today's
two-hour argument session.
   Benjamin Civiletti was the last attorney general to argue a case
before the justices when he appeared in 1980 to present the Carter
administration's side in a case involving the deportation of an
alleged Nazi.
   Thornburgh last argued a case before the high court in 1977 when
he headed the Justice Department's criminal division.
   In today's cases, the justices agreed to decide whether the
nation's railroads may require all employees involved in accidents
to take drug tests; and whether the Customs Service may impose the
tests for those seeking drug-enforcement jobs.
   Both cases involve governmental authority to test workers for the
presence of drugs.
   The eventual rulings by the court, expected sometime in 1989,
will not deal with drug tests for private employees. But the
decisions could have an important psychological impact on whether
businesses will demand that their workers undergo such tests.
   Tests conducted by federal, state or local governments will be
affected directly by the court's action.
   In the railroad case, the Federal Railroad Administration issued
regulations in 1985 aimed at alleviating ``a significant safety
problem'' caused by alcohol and drug use among employees.
   The agency, an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation,
generally requires railroads to take blood and urine specimens after
accidents, incidents and rules violations.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in February that the
tests are unreasonable searches banned by the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment.
   ``Accidents, incidents or rule violations, by themselves, do not
create reasonable grounds for suspecting that tests will demonstrate
alcohol or drug impairment in any one railroad employee, much less
an entire train crew,'' the appeals court said.
   Government lawyers have said that from 1972 through 1983,
railroad accidents linked to drug or alcohol abuse killed 42 people,
injured 61 and caused some $19 million in property damage.
   In the Customs Service case, the government contends the need to
fight drug smuggling justifies mandatory tests for those applying
for or holding drug-enforcement jobs.
   Workers in such sensitive jobs must provide urine samples in
restroom stalls as a person overseeing the procedure waits outside
the stall. Testing was authorized under an executive order President
Reagan signed in 1986.
   The Reagan administration has said the tests are needed to
prevent agents who use drugs from being bribed or blackmailed. Any
sacrifice of personal privacy is outweighed by the need to stop drug
smuggling, the administration said.
   The National Treasury Employees Union, in challenging the tests,
said they subject workers to a humiliating invasion of privacy.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the tests for
Customs Service workers in such sensitive jobs.

<HEAD>Solidarity, Official Union Plan to Cooperate to Save Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa told a rally of nearly all the
10,000 workers at the Lenin shipyard Wednesday that Solidarity and a
government-backed union will cooperate for the first time to try to
keep the shipyard open.
   The government, meanwhile, announced a new approach to Walesa by
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak to start delayed talks
between authorities and the opposition on Poland's future.
   Walesa, leader of the outlawed Solidarity union, announced the
unprecedented cooperation with the rival official OPZZ trade union
during the outdoor rally at the shipyard where Solidarity sprang up
during nationwide strikes in August 1980.
   The rally took place on the first workday since the government on
Monday revealed its plans to close the yard Dec. 1, citing economic
reasons. The move was denounced by activists as a deliberate blow by
new Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski aimed at his longtime
nemesis Solidarity, a charge Rakowski has denied.
   Solidarity and the official trade union said in a joint
resolution that, ``The liquidation of the enterprise ... is a
completely political decision because the financial position of the
shipyard is advantageous at the present moment.
   ``One must not decide the future of the Gdansk shipyard without
consulting the workcrew. We will defend our shipyard.''
   But Walesa appeared to rule out a strike for the moment, said it
``would only make the situation worse.'' Activists said they wanted
to avoid creating any confrontation that might jeopardize Mrs.
Thatcher's planned visit to a monument just outside the shipyard
Friday.
   Walesa said the common position reached by Solidarity with the
OPZZ ``is proof the unions can reach agreement at any moment
provided we are not set against each other by someone else.''
   ``We are united by this single goal _ saving the shipyard,'' he
said. It proves ``that pluralism is possible.''
   He added that he has received messages from all over the country
that people are willing to buy shares in the shipyard in order to
preserve it.
   The joint stance with the official union marks a reversal of
Solidarity's earlier position not to talk to OPZZ, which was set up
in 1982 after the martial-law crackdown on Solidarity.
   Although the OPZZ continues to oppose introduction of union
pluralism _ saying it alone can best represent all workers, even
Solidarity supporters _ hostility between the OPZZ and Solidarity
has been diminishing. On the factory floor, the two groups have been
known to cooperate on local issues.
   Solidarity questions the independence of the official union,
particularly at the national level. The head of the OPZZ is a member
of the ruling communist party Politiburo.
   ``This is for the first time that OPZZ and Solidarity have
declared cooperation so publically and so officially, although not
100 percent of unionists are ready to defend the shipyard at any
cost,'' said Franciszek Ciemny, national spokesman for the OPZZ,
interviewed by telephone in Warsaw.
   He said the OPZZ national secretariat met about the shipyard
Wednesday and endorsed the government's motives to reform the
economy, but decided to press for improvements in the shipyard's
efficiency rather than an abrupt closure.
   The OPZZ leadership asked for a meeting with government officials
Nov. 9 to set procedures for working out alternative solutions to
the shutting down of workplaces, Ciemny said.
   Walesa said he believed Rakowski's decision to close the shipyard
has ended hopes that the round-table between authorities and the
opposition on Poland's future could begin soon.
   ``At this moment it is losing sense,'' he said. ``On the one hand
you are trying to talk about various subjects, and on the other hand
you close the cradle of Solidarity and Walesa's workplace. It
doesn't make sense.''
   He said he wasn't pronouncing the talks dead, but said he hoped
authorities would reconsider their recent actions.
   At the shipyard rally, management encouraged workers to take up
tools and work peaceably. The thousands of workers who braved icy
wind to report for 6 a.m. shift appeared willing to follow the
advice.
   ``Just the way we fight beautifully and sing beautifully, we are
going to work beautifully,'' Walesa said.
   The yard has long been a symbol of worker dissent in Poland. Its
August 1980 strike toppled Communist Party leader Edward Gierek and
a strike in August of this year contributed to the ouster of Prime
Minister Zbigniew Messner.
   Rakowski said he ordered the closing of the yard as the first
major act of his pledge to restructure Poland's outdated,
money-losing heavy industries.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban contacted Polish state radio to
say the prime minister has asked Kiszczak ``to turn to Lech Walesa
to mutually overcome the difficulties in the preparation for the
round table.''
   But there was no sign the government was prepared to drop its
objections to Solidarity's proposed delegation to the talks, which
has been the major stumbling block.
   The long-promised talks, due to start in mid-October, stalled
when the government required Walesa to purge two delegates whom
authorities deemed extremist. Walesa refused to allow interference
in his delegation, saying it would set a bad precedent.
   The developments came as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain arrived in Poland, beginning a three-day visit set to
include meetings with top political leaders as well as a highly
symbolic excursion to Gdansk to see Walesa.

<HEAD>Newspapers Say 20 Face Charges in Brno</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty people detained during an
illegal independence day rally last week face fines and criminal
prosecution, according to newspapers received in Prague on Wednesday.
   Eight more people detained prior to another rally are likely to
be charged with incitement, which carries a sentence of up to eight
years in prison.
   Newspapers from the Moravian capital of Brno said about 350
people took part in the banned rally Friday to commemorate the 70th
anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence.
   The crowd included young people ``in extravagant dress,''
activists with the human rights movement Charter 77 and
``deplorably, also mothers with small children,'' one newspaper
account said.
   The Brno newspapers said 39 people were detained after police
broke up the Brno demonstration and that 20 of them face charges.
   The newspapers said eight will be charged with unspecified
misdeeds, which can be tried before a criminal court, and 12 face
misdemeanor charges, which are tried before National Committees,
tribunals of local representatives.
   Both can be entered on a person's identity documents, giving them
a police record.
   The same day as the Brno rally, police used tear gas, water
cannon, batons and dogs to break up an illegal rally in Prague by
about 5,000 people.
   Authorities announced that eight people detained during a sweep
before that rally face charges of incitement that could send them to
jail for up to eight years.
   Prague's evening newspaper Vecerni Praha said Monday that
employers of each of the eight activists with the Independent Peace
Association will be informed in writing about the charges.
   The newspaper criticized by name Hana Marvanova, a leading
activist, saying she was frequently absent from work and used this
time ``mostly for anti-state activities.''
   Other Prague activists held were described as having previous
convictions for rowdiness, theft and drug-related offenses.
   Petr Uhl, a leading activist, told The Associated Press in Vienna
that most of the dozens of others who were detained, including
banned playwright Vaclav Havel, had been released.
   Uhl, a Charter 77 signatory, said the eight still in custody
included three prominent members of the Independent Peace
Association, Tomas Dvorak, Hana Marvanova and Lubos Vydra.
   The Peace Association was one of five groups that called the
Prague rally.
   The other activists still in custody were Petr Cibulka, Dusan
Skala, Ivan Jirous, Jiri Tichy and a Roman Catholic priest,
Frantisek Lizna, Uhl said.
   Uhl said Havel, who was detained Thursday, was released Monday
without being charged.
   However, Uhl said authorities were preparing a criminal case of
incitement against a new dissident group, the Movement for Civil
Freedom. He said house searches and interrogations were conducted in
the past five days.

   Just about everybody, it seems, is becoming
turned off by the never-ending opinion polls of the 1988
presidential campaign, which critics say are trivializing issues and
alienating voters.
   Democratis nominee Michael Dukakis, who is trailing in the polls,
has led the attack on their role in the election. Even Republicans
are questioning whether survey results may improperly influence
voters' choices.
   ``The question is whether these polls are giving the impression
to the American people that their vote doesn't matter,'' Republican
National Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said in an interview.
``There is that danger.''
   The public also is down on polls. Forty-five percent in a recent
Gallup survey said reporting who's ahead is bad for the country, and
as many said polls do not improve election coverage. Even more _ 52
percent _ said polls should not be reported in the final weeks of a
presidential campaign.
   That disquiet may stem from the way polls have muscled so heavily
into the contest this year. Bush and Dukakis have been rated in more
than 90 major national surveys, six times the number conducted in
the 1964 election.
   ``I think people are a little tired of all the horserace polls,''
said Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization. ``They want
to know what the state of the race is and they're interested in
public opinion. But there has been such a barrage of polls that
they're saturated.''
   Dukakis, frustrated by his persistent underdog showing in the
polls, has begun to lash out. He says voters are ``not going to let
the pollsters or anyone else make their decisions for them.''
   In fact, the poll-takers agree. Poll results may shape
perceptions of who's ahead but they do not influence voter
decisions, the experts said in interviews this week. The evidence is
in the polls themselves.
   ``Every time people complain about the polls they talk about it
leading opinion,'' said CBS News pollster Warren Mitofsky. ``If that
was the case, the polls would never change except to go up for the
leading candidate.''
   ``I don't know of a single pollster or political analyst who
believes that the polls are creating a bandwagon effect,'' said
Everett Ladd, head of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research
at the University of Connecticut.
   ``There's a lot of evidence that people reach their voting
decisions for deep and very substantial reasons,'' Ladd said. ``They
have interests and identifications that they bring to bear on the
process. They aren't tossed around because of what a poll finds.''
   Gallup polls provide evidence: The share of respondents who
expect Bush to win grew from 45 percent in mid-August to 68 percent
last week. But Bush's lead grew by far less, from four points to 10
among registered voters.
   ``What's happening is that people are recognizing that Bush is
ahead,'' said Kohut. ``But it doesn't seem to be affecting voter
preferences.''
   There are other concerns. Critics say polls have hogged too much
of the media's campaign coverage, and that the focus on Bush's lead
could dissuade voters from turning out on Election Day.
   ``It's not just the existence of the polls themselves. It's when
we get into the indication of the polls that the race is over,''
Fahrenkopf said. ``I have no indication that that affects voter
turnout. But it could.''
   CBS News' Mitofsky argues that it does not. Despite the
proliferation of polls, ``participation has stayed at the same share
of the number of people registered in every election since 1964,''
he said.
   ``If people were only going to vote for who they thought would
win,'' Mitofsky said, ``then there wouldn't be a single Democratic
vote for president cast in Utah,'' where Republicans predominate in
national races.
   A related question is whether exit polls discouraged turnout in
1980, when the networks declared Ronald Reagan the winner while
polls in the West were still open.
   Los Angeles Times pollster I.A. Lewis said his surveys indicated
turnout was not affected by the call, but it is difficult to gauge.
   If such polls did discourage turnout, Lewis noted, the effect at
least would likely be evenhanded, with the results creating
complacency among one candidate's backers as much as discouragement
among the other's.
   Some pollsters agreed that surveys have drawn increasing _ and
perhaps inordinate _ media attention.
   But Lewis noted that before news organizations conducted polls,
they made do with possibly misleading briefings from the candidates'
own pollsters. Without the polls, Kohut said, the media would rely
on the unsubstantiated views of pundits.
   ``It's unfortunate the candidates are hammered by the polls,''
Kohut said. ``But if it wasn't the polls, they'd be hammered by some
other, less objective measure of the dynamics of the race.''

   Scores of blacks protesting
Archbishop Desmond Tutu's support of sanctions were treated to tea
at his residence Wednesday while their leaders conferred with
Anglican leaders.
   About 200 residents of Crossroads, a shantytown near Cape Town,
came in minibuses to Tutu's official residence in the wealthy Cape
Town neighborhood of Bishopscourt.
   Tutu, leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa, was
attending an ecumenical church conference in Kenya, but other
Anglican leaders met with representatives of the protesters.
   A statement issued after the meeting said both sides agreed that
apartheid was a fundamental cause of South Africa's problems and
that blacks suffered economically long before sanctions were imposed.
   Tutu has been the target of several protests this year involving
blacks who claim they are losing job opportunities because of
sanctions.
   Previous protests have been featured prominently on newscasts of
the state-run television network, and Tutu's staff has suggested
there is an orchestrated campaign to create a false impression the
archbishop is widely opposed by his fellow blacks.
   Crossroads has been dominated since 1986 by a conservative
faction which ousted anti-apartheid activists during a series of
battles. President P.W. Botha visited the shantytown in August.

   A Navy program to train dolphins as underwater
security guards is in disarray, with four of the animals dead and
others blinded or crippled by abusive handlers, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer quoted unidentified sources,
including two former trainers who asked that their names be
withheld, as saying four of the Navy's three dozen dolphins have
died in the past 18 months.
   The former trainers said some of the dolphins have been blinded
or have suffered crippling injuries as a result of poor training
procedures.
   The program, which trains dolphins to hunt for mines and enemy
frogmen, leaves the animals vulnerable to infection or illness by
moving them from cooler to warmer water and subjects them to other
stress, they said.
   In Washington, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley today
denied animals had been mistreated.
   ``We simply do not use negative techniques and browbeat these
mammals into doing what we want to do,'' said Quigley. ``Even (the
environmental group) Greenpeace has complimented our training
methods as better than the industry.
   ``We use positive reinforcement and we depend upon a close
relationship between the trainer and animal. Ultimately in the
training, you have to go to the open ocean. If we were mistreating
these mammals, why would they return to their trainers?''
   A trainer, Rick Trout, who has worked at the Navy project in San
Diego since 1985, told a convention of the International Marine
Animal Trainers Association in San Antonio, Texas, this week he saw
``specific incidences of abuse, weight loss, corporal punishment and
damage to animals after transport.''
   Trainers use ``very negative methods, including food deprivation,
corporal punishment (hitting), and other aversive techniques,''
Trout said.
   The newspaper said one dolphin died last month near Port Townsend
and two others died earlier in San Diego, where the program is based.
   Last year, a dolphin died during patrol in the Persian Gulf of
what the Navy said was some type of bacterial infection that
developed into pneumonia. After that, four other dolphins were
returned to United States.
   A Persian Gulf environmentalist, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said at the time that the dolphin probably was not used
to the gulf environment and its bacteria.
   Quigley said the Navy program currently includes 115 animals,
most of them dolphins and the remainder sea lions and Beluga whales.
   The work began more than 20 years ago, and the Navy has records
showing its mortality rate is much lower than the industry standard,
Quigley added. He said he was checking to determine if there had
been four deaths in the past 18 months.
   ``I know of two deaths within the past year,'' he said. ``One
involved a dolphin sent to the Persian Gulf, and the other involved
a dolphin that died 11 days after being sent to Indian Island in the
Pacific Northwest. We're still awaiting laboratory reports on the
cause of that last death.
   ``But I can say categorically that we have not had any deaths
through mistreatment.''
   Sources quoted by the newspaper blamed the project's problems on
rapid turnover among employees in San Diego and pressure to expand
the project to the Trident nuclear submarine base at Bangor and
other sites.

   British Airways resumed flights to Baghdad
on Wednesday, 20 months after they were suspended because of Iranian
missile attacks on the Iraqi capital during the gulf war.
   The airline, Britain's flag carrier, will have two flights a week
to Baghdad via Cairo.
   British Airways halted its service to Baghdad and Tehran in March
1987 during fierce missile attacks on both capitals.
   An airline spokesman said it also was considering starting a
London-Baghdad service with its supersonic Concorde jetliner. But he
noted no agreement has been reached yet with Iraq's civil aviation
authorities.
   Other foreign airlines were expected to resume flights to Baghdad
following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the 8-year-old gulf war.
   Gulf Air, owned by Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates, announced that it will resume flights to Baghdad and
Tehran this month.
   British Airways is scheduled to resume flights to Tehran on Dec.
15, with a twice-weekly service via Cyprus.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto has
put her campaign for Nov. 16 elections on the rails _ literally _ in
a 31-stop tour before thousands of chanting and flag-waving
followers.
   Ms. Bhutto, recovered from giving birth to her first child in
September and an illness last month, rode the green and yellow
``Khyber Mail'' from Sunday to Tuesday as the train wound its way
1,000 miles through Pakistan.
   The followers lined the tracks from Karachi in the south to
Rawalpindi in the north. They were the biggest crowds so far in the
campaign which pits her left-leaning Pakistan People's Party against
a wobbly center-right political alliance dominated by the Pakistan
Muslim League.
   From the door of her air-conditioned coach, she preached the
message handed down by her late father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto: democracy and prosperity to the poor masses.
   After 27 hours, her voice was a barely audible rasp.
   ``They don't want to listen to me, they simply want to see me,''
Ms. Bhutto, 35, confided as the train rolled through the darkness in
southern Punjab.
   Scores of supporters waving the red, green and black party flag
rode on the roof. Two of them were killed south of the rural town of
Multan when a low bridge knocked them under the wheels.
   Her father led a popularly elected socialist government from 1973
to 1977 when the army chief, Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, ousted him in
a military coup. Bhutto was hanged two years later after being
convicted of conspiracy in the killing of a political foe.
   Zia's 11-year rule ended Aug. 17 when he was killed in a plane
crash. U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphael and 28 others also died in the
crash of the C-130 transport plane.
   Although sabotage was suspected, the cause of the crash is still
under investigation.
   Zia had ordered November elections on a non-party basis the month
before.
   Ms. Bhutto challenged Zia's non-party decree in the Supreme
Court, which ruled Oct. 2 in favor of free party-based elections.
   She gave birth to her first child, a boy, on Sept. 21. Just as
she was to kick off her campaign Oct. 16, a kidney infection put her
back in bed.
   On Monday night, Ms. Bhutto, party aides, bodyguards and
reporters boarded the northbound Khyber Mail in Karachi station.
   At Multan station, Khaswar Mirza was asked why he came to see her.
   ``I have spent six years in prison and had 12 lashes for her
(during Zia's rule). She is my leader and I am prepared to spend
another six years for her,'' he said.
   Although the country has not had free elections in more than a
decade, Ms. Bhutto's party is widely expected to win a majority in a
new 217-member National Assembly.
   In Nov. 19 provincial assembly elections, the Bhutto forces are
expected to do well in the populous Sind and Punjab.
   Arid Baluchistan and the rugged North-West Frontier are expected
to favor the leftist Awami (People's) National Party of Abdul Wali
Khan.

   Barbara Bush twice muffed the name of the local
Republican congressman during a campaign stop in her hometown on
Wednesday and finally gave up, urging the crowd to just ``vote for
all these people.''
   ``It was here that I grew up, got educated, got married at the
Presbyterian church down the street,'' the wife of GOP presidential
candidate George Bush told about 1,000 people outside City Hall.
``It was here that I learned values. George grew up just around the
corner and learned the same values of God and family and pride in
country that you and I have.''
   Bush grew up in neighboring Greenwich, Conn.
   Then, urging votes for local Republicans, she tried to endorse
Rep. Joseph DioGuardi for re-election.
   But she called him ``DelGadio,'' and after bungling the second
attempt as well, asked the crowd to ``vote for all these people''
and said she was giving up on the names.

   President Corazon Aquino ordered the
nation's largest domestic shipping firm closed Wednesday while the
government inspects its crews and ships after accidents that killed
thousands of people.
   Officials of the company, Sulpicio Lines, Inc., said the
indefinite closing was unfair and would disrupt shipping across the
island nation.
   The order came nine days after Sulpicio's Dona Marilyn ferry sank
during a typhoon with about 500 people aboard. In December, another
Sulpicio ferry, the Dona Paz, collided with an oil tanker and sank.
The official death toll of that accident was about 1,500, but some
estimates have said more than 3,000 people may have died.
   ``Since Sulpicio is beset by these accidents, we would like to
have a closer look at their operations,'' Secretary of
Transportation Reinerio Reyes said.
   Reyes told reporters Mrs. Aquino was aware of the ship shortage
in the Philippines and ordered the inspection of Sulpicio's vessels
be completed as soon as possible.
   ``The main reason is we want to prevent loss of lives,'' Reyes
said. ``We want to make sure (the ships) are seaworthy and manned by
competent crews.''
   Sulpicio operates 22 passenger and cargo vessels, which account
for 20 percent of domestic sea traffic among the country's 7,200
islands.
   In the central Philippine city of Cebu, hub of the country's
domestic shipping, Sulpicio's president and general manager, Carlos
Go, said he was unaware of the order.
   ``It's bad for the public because they have fewer vessels to
ride,'' Go said. He refused further comment.
   Go's brother Eusebio, the company's executive vice president,
said the order was unnecessary and unfair.
   ``They can inspect the ships without suspending the operations,''
he said. Sulpicio officials were to appear before the Maritime
Industry Authority, a Department of Transportation agency, on
Thursday to show why the company's operations should not be
suspended.
   Reyes said he recommended to Mrs. Aquino that Sulpicio be
temporarily closed so its ships could be inspected and their crews'
qualifications tested.
   ``The president agreed that this was the right step to take,'' he
said, adding that the company's franchise could be if widespread
deficiencies were found.
   Before Reyes met with Mrs. Aquino, his department issued orders
holding four Sulpicio ships in port because they allegedly had
inadequate communications equipment.
   The search for victims of the Dona Marilyn sinking is still going
on. Like the Dona Paz, it has been difficult to determine the number
of victims because of confusion over how many people were aboard.
   The Dona Marilyn sailed Oct. 23 from Manila for the Leyte island
port of Tacloban, despite warnings that Typhoon Ruby was approaching.
   Vicente Gambito, vice president of Sulpicio Lines, said 161
passengers and 39 crewmen were rescued after it sank about 300 miles
southeast of Manila.
   He said at least 76 people were confirmed dead but only 54 bodies
had been recovered.
   Sulpicio said the manifest showed about 487 passengers and crew,
but the ship radioed after leaving Manila that it was carrying 517
people. The coast guard in Manila said it counted 491 people before
the ship left Manila.

   A man awaiting execution early Thursday
for the murder of a nurse appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for a
reprieve today.
   A federal court in San Antonio and an appeals court in New
Orleans on Tuesday had refused to halt the execution of Donald Gene
Franklin, 37.
   Franklin's case virtually halted all Texas executions for a year
when the Supreme Court agreed to consider his challenge to the Texas
capital punishment law.
   But the court in June rejected 6-3 his claim that jurors were not
allowed to consider mitigating circumstances in deciding his
punishment.
   Defense attorney George Scharmen filed an appeal today with the
nation's highest court. Franklin, who has had three trials and at
least five execution dates, faces lethal injection for the 1975
abduction-slaying of a San Antonio nurse.
   The three-judge federal appeals court panel that turned down
Franklin's request Tuesday said the inmate's third such attempt
``presents no more than one warmed-over variation on a claim made
earlier and denied.''
   In their latest appeal to the Supreme Court, attorneys are again
raising the issue of mitigating circumstances _ specifically,
testimony from Franklin's mother about his growing up in a broken
home _ and hope the high court's review of another Texas case
involving death row inmate Johnny Penry will mean a reprieve for
Franklin.
   ``There's some reason for optimism based on Penry,'' Scharmen
said. ``On the other hand, Franklin has received three trials and
several stays. So in terms of optimism, I really don't know what to
say.''
   State attorneys have characterized Franklin, on death row for
nearly 12{ years, as the most likely to die of the more than 280
condemned inmates in Texas.
   ``This time I think it's maybe finally going to happen,'' said
Bill Zapalac, an assistant attorney general.

rest 20-year loans with an interest rate of 7.72 percent, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   China has been granted $7.2 billion in World Bank loans since it
resumed its membership in the organization in 1980. In 1988, loans
reached about $1.7 billion, 10 percent of total bank lending.
   Loans to China have gone to 66 projects in energy,
transportation, agriculture and industry.
   Bank President Barber Conable said in March that China will
receive about $12 billion in loans between 1988 and 1992, and that
by 1990, China will be the largest recipient of credit from the
International Development Association, the bank's wing for
low-interest long-term loans to developing countries.

<HEAD>Review of IRS Penalties Next on Senator's Agenda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chief sponsor of a
``taxpayers' bill of rights,'' said Wednesday he plans to ask
Congress next year to review the 152 types of penalties that can be
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``We think that many of those 152 penalties are extremely
arbitrary and we're going to be reviewing them,'' Pryor said.
   Pryor commented during a breakfast meeting with about 40 people
to thank a variety of groups for supporting his ``taxpayers' bill of
rights.'' The measure was approved by the Senate and House two weeks
ago as part of a package of tax legislation enacted shortly before
the 100th Congress adjourned.
   The bill has yet to be signed by President Reagan, Pryor noted,
but ``I don't believe he will veto it.''
   The bill requires the IRS to tell taxpayers about their rights
before being audited, allows taxpayers to be represented by lawyers
during all proceedings and also permits taxpayers to collect damages
in suits against the IRS.
   ``We did something that has not been done for 124 years, and that
is strengthen the hand of the taxpayers,'' Pryor said.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., a co-sponsor of the bill, agreed. ``This
is something that will really help the American public,'' he told
the meeting.

   Jay Robinson says he won't move from his
home, even though cars have run into it twice in less than two
months.
   ``The Lord has protected us two times,'' Robinson said Tuesday as
he surveyed the wreckage caused by the Halloween night crash. ``Why
not three?''
   Fortunately, Robinson said, no one was home at about 9 p.m.
Monday when a 1977 Chevrolet Monza crashed through the house, which
is located opposite where a major road in the rural area makes a
90-degree turn.
   ``When my wife got home, the car was totally hidden in the living
room,'' said Robinson. ``If anybody had been here last night,
there's no doubt they would have been hurt.
   ``The Lord is protecting us,'' he added.
   Trooper Pat McNeilly said the driver, Mark Andrew Root, 20, tried
to run away, but was tackled by neighbors. Root, who was treated for
minor injuries, was held in lieu of $13,000 bail on various charges.
   Robinson said work was recently completed on repairs from the
last time someone failed to make the corner.
   About six weeks ago Robinson and his 13-year-old daughter were
sitting in the living room when they heard the screech of a car
skidding.
   ``I got up and was opening the door just as the car crashed
through the wall right by where we'd been sitting,'' Robinson said.

<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry lent
credibility and respectability to South Africa's apartheid regime by
participating in a Bahamian golf tournament partially supported by
an oil company doing business in that African nation, according to a
local union official.
   Joslyn N. Williams, president of the Washington Metropolitan
Council of the AFL-CIO said he was ``distressed'' that Barry was
present for the tournament, which began Wednesday.
   Barry has been one of the most prominent Washington leaders of
the movement to boycott the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies,
Williams said Tuesday. The Shell companies are partial sponsors of
the tournament, according to a tournament organizer.
   Barry's press secretary, John C. White, said the trip was paid
for by Resorts International Ltd., a company that operates gambling
casinos, including a casino at the Paradise Island Resort in the
Bahamas.
   White said Barry was not a golfer and would not participate in
the tournament.
   Barry said he knew the tournament was partially sponsored by
Shell, but added, ``Everybody knows where I stand'' on South Africa.
   ``I cut up my credit card from Shell,'' he said.
   Barry returned to Washington on Monday from a five-day business
trip to California and Hawaii.
   Tournament director Fred Higgs told The Washington Post the
Paradise Island Celebrity Golf Tournament's major sponsors were the
Bahamas Ministry of Tourism and Resorts International. He declined
to say how much Shell contributed to the event.
   White said city officials had determined the anti-apartheid
boycott was aimed at Shell's South African and U.S. subsidiaries,
not its company in the Bahamas.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it does not make any difference
whether it is Shell U.S.A., Shell Bahamas. It is all part of one
giant conglomerate, and that conglomerate is exploiting blacks in
South Africa,'' Williams said.
   ``When prominent leaders, especially prominent black leaders, get
tied in with Shell in any shape or form, it diminishes the struggle
in South Africa,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dieting and Exercising Improve Cholesterol Levels</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release at 6 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Programs to help people lower their risk of heart
disease should put more emphasis on losing weight and getting
exercise, according to a new study.
   The recommendation is based on a finding that both dieting and
exercise help men and women improve their cholesterol levels.
   Experts have long known that fat people, who are at increased
risk of heart trouble, also have relatively low levels of
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL. This so-called good
cholesterol helps keep the arteries free of dangerous deposits.
   On the other hand, people who get lots of exercise tend to have
higher amounts of protective HDL.
   The latest study, conducted at Stanford University, was intended
to look separately at the effects of dieting and exercise on the
cholesterol levels of overweight men. It found that men who slimmed
down were able to raise their good cholesterol levels, regardless of
whether they took off the weight through dieting or exercising.
   ``It appears that attention to weight loss and increased exercise
should be more strongly emphasized in contemporary campaigns to
reduce risk of coronary heart disease,'' the researchers wrote.
   The study was directed by Dr. Peter D. Wood and published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   For a year, they studied 131 overweight men who ranged in age
from 30 to 59. One-third of them went on diets, one-third jogged and
the rest did nothing differently. Although only men were studied,
the study said its conclusions would apply to both men and women.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Henry Blackburn and David R.
Jacobs Jr. of the University of Minnesota said that burning up 150
to 300 calories a day in such moderate activities as walking and
working around the house is beneficial exercise.

   The United States and Canada issued a joint

   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States
already has a ``no-takeoff policy'' concerning hijackings but
decided that a cooperative approach with Canada could serve as a
deterrent to further hijackings.
   The two countries agreed the policy would be in effect ``except

   They also agreed to take ``all appropriate measures to restore
control of the hijacked aircraft to its lawful commander and to
detain the hijackers for the purpose of prosecution or extradition.''

   The launch of the attack submarine Miami,
which had been delayed by a 103-day strike by workers at the
Electric Boat shipyard, has been scheduled for Nov. 12.
   Because of the production slowdown caused by the strike that
ended last month, the shipyard has not launched a submarine since
the Trident ballistic missile submarine Pennsylvania was christened
April 23.
   The Miami, an improved Los Angeles-class submarine, was
originally scheduled for launch July 30.
   The 10,000-member Metal Trades Council struck July 1 to Oct. 11
over wage and benefit issues. Salaried employees and strike-breakers
continued limited construction on the shipyard's backlog of eight
Trident and eight attack submarines.
   Electric Boat spokesman Neil D. Ruenzel said Tuesday that 3,557
union workers are back on the job and that 5,877 have been contacted
about returning to work. The recall is expected to take another two
weeks, he said.
   The Miami will be the 26th Los Angeles-class submarine launched
at Electric Boat, one of only two submarine builders in the country.
The last attack sub launched at Electric Boat was the Topeka, on
Jan. 23.

   Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka suffered
a mild heart attack after his morning workout today at the team's
training camp and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition,
officials said.
   The 49-year-old National Football League coach was given
medication, said Dr. Jay Alexander, a cardiologist at Lake Forest
Hospital.
   ``It's too soon to say when he will be back and resuming his
duties,'' Alexander said. ``He suggested 48 hours.''
   Bears President Mike McCaskey said Ditka appeared to be in good
spirits and joked about visiting a friend at the hospital later
today.
   ``He felt a little rueful about all this. He was beginning to
realize that there was a good reason to be brought to the
hospital,'' McCaskey said.
   Ditka suffered chest pains as he was getting dressed for an
appearance at a rally for George Bush in nearby Prairie View and was
taken to the hospital by private vehicle, said Bears spokesman Bryan
Harlan.
   Assistant coach Johnny Roland said Ditka suffered chest pains
Monday as well but apparently did nothing about them. Roland said
three assistant coaches persuaded Ditka to go to the hospital.
   ``He was fighting us, not necessarily fighting us, but
discouraging us from going to get help,'' Roland said. ``But you
could tell he was obviously in dire need of help.''
   Known for his fiery temperament as a player and coach, Ditka has
spent 27 years in pro football and was accorded the game's highest
honor by being inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame earlier this year.
   Ditka began his professional career as a tight end with the Bears
in 1961, when he was named rookie of the year. He was named to the
next five Pro Bowls.
   Ditka was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in 1967 and then to
the Dallas Cowboys, where he finished his playing career after 12
years.
   The native of Aliquippa, Pa., began his coaching career with the
Cowboys and worked there nine years before being named head coach of
the Bears in 1982.
   He led the Bears to the Super Bowl in 1985 and entered this
season with a 61-27 mark, including seven post-season appearances.
The Bears are 7-2 this season.

   Three tractor-trailers collided, killing
one driver and more than a dozen cows and setting off a series of
accidents that virtually shut down a section of Interstate 70, state
police said.
   Lewis Terrell, 33, of Strasburg, Va., was killed when his
westbound tractor-trailer, which was hauling an undetermined number
of beef cattle, sideswiped a garbage truck and overturned just east
of the Bentleyville exit around 7 p.m. Tuesday, said Trooper Ike
Mogle.
   The driver of the garbage truck escaped just before his vehicle
burst into flames and was hospitalized with a concussion, Mogle said.
   An automobile carrier approaching from the opposite direction
then hit the cattle truck, which had flipped into the middle of the
interstate, Mogle said. The driver of the car carrier was not
injured, authorities said.
   Bentleyville Fire Chief Walter Wisniewski said 15 to 20 cows were
killed on impact or had to be destroyed.
   Traffic was backed up for several miles, police said.

   A Taiwanese man was convicted of murder
for helping set up a drug ripoff Feb. 5 that left two federal agents
and two gunmen dead.
   Su Re ``Michael'' Chia, 21, was found guilty Tuesday of two
counts of murder and one each of attempted murder, robbery and
conspiracy. He could receive up to two consecutive life terms at
sentencing Dec. 21.
   Drug Enforcement Administration agents Paul Seema and George
Montoya were shot to death and a third agent was wounded after they
attempted to make an $80,000 undercover heroin buy and were instead
robbed and shot.
   In a shootout with backup agents, a 17-year-old man and a
27-year-old also were killed. Win Wei ``William'' Wang, 19, was
wounded and was charged with murder.
   Investigators said the killers planned the double-cross robbery
from the start and did not know they were dealing with DEA agents.
Prosecutors said Chia delivered a gun, gave a ride to one of the
killers and acted as a lookout.
   ``We were delighted,'' Deputy District Attorney Joe Martinez said
of the verdict.
   ``We had to convince the jury that he was an aider and abettor
and a conspirator. So we had to select a jury that could understand
the complexities of the conspiracy laws.''
   Defense attorney Brian Lysaght said he will appeal.

   Chavez, who has been recuperating from a 36-day, water-only fast
this summer, was hurt Sunday when the handrail on his porch gave
way, and he fell about eight feet to the ground.
   The union leader broke his wrist and bruised his head, chest and
back, said his son Paul. The accident occurred at the Chavez home at
UFW headquarters in Keene, about 125 miles north of Los Angeles.
   Chavez was released from Kern Medical Center on Tuesday, said
nursing administrator Robin Donaldson.
   Chavez's fast was to protest the use of pesticides on California
table grapes. He ended it Aug. 21.

said Bridget Dolan, a spokeswoman for Jennings' booking agency.
   The singer was released from the hospital Thursday and went home
the following day, she said
   Jennings, whose hits include ``Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow

   ``We are happy for our leader's wise decision, and we hope it

   It said the monarch's decision will be regarded as part of a

   Iran and Iraq held their second face-to-face peace
talks in 24 hours Wednesday, and the U.N. secretary-general said the
quickened pace showed a willingness by both sides to end their war.
   But statements from the Iranian and Iraqi foreign ministers made
clear there has been no narrowing of positions.
   Foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of
Iraq agreed Tuesday to meet face-to-face in all future sessions to
speed up the negotiations.
   The talks are aimed at consolidating a truce that went into
effect Aug. 20 after both sides accepted a U.N. Security Council
cease-fire resolution.
   Until now, the talks had been mostly conducted in an indirect
fashion, with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and his
mediating team shuttling between the two delegations seated in
separate rooms.
   Perez de Cuellar said the change was a ``very good sign.''
   Velayati and Aziz did not talk to reporters as they arrived for
the joint session at the European U.N. headquarters.
   Earlier, Aziz renewed Baghdad's call for an exchange of war
prisoners to proceed immediately.
   After meeting with the president of the International Committee
of the Red Cross, Cornelio Sommaruga, Aziz said the international
community should pressure Iran to agree to the prisoner exchange,
independent of what happens in the talks.
   Iran, through a delegation spokesman, reiterated its demand that
such an exchange should come in the framework of the talks.
Spokesman Morteza Sarmadi said priority should be given to
withdrawal of the forces to internationally recognized boundaries.
   Troops are only a few yards apart at some points.
   Definition of the common border is the main stumbling block in
the talks, which began Aug. 25.
   Iran and Iraq are pledged to begin repatriation of war prisoners
``without delay'' after cessation of hostilities. The International
Committee of the Red Cross oversees its implementation.
   In a note to both countries Oct. 4, the Red Cross asked Baghdad
and Tehran to facilitate an agreement on the exchange by providing
complete lists of the prisoners they hold and proceeding with
repatriation of the sick and wounded.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners in Iran and
19,284 Iranians in Iraq. It estimates that the number of
unregistered prisoners is at least 20,000 to 30,000 in both Iran and
Iraq.
   A U.N. report compiled in July said the number of prisoners in
Iraq may be close to 35,000 and in Iraq up to 75,000.

<HEAD>Negotiators Fail To Resolve Dispute Over Siberian Facility</HEAD>

   U.S. and Soviet negotiators failed Wednesday to
settle their dispute over a Siberian radar facility, and the Reagan
administration warned it may take steps to unravel the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   After Soviet experts outlined their views at a meeting in Geneva,
the State Department demanded that the installation at Krasnoyarsk
be dismantled and its equipment destroyed.
   ``Unfortunately, the Soviet experts did not have any new
proposal,'' department spokesman Charles E. Redman said in giving an
account of the session.
   In two reports to Congress, the administration charged the
Soviets with violating the ABM treaty by constructing a radar
facility that could be used to organize a national defense against
missile attack.
   The theory behind the treaty is that if both sides were unable to
mount a defense they would hesitate to launch an attack. Otherwise,
their territory and populations would be open to devastating
retaliation.
   The Geneva session was held at the Soviets' request and indicated
a settlement might be possible. Viktor P. Karpov, the foreign
ministry's senior arms control specialist, had said in July that the
Soviets would dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar if the two sides
resolved their differences over the 1972 treaty.
   ``We had hoped they were prepared to meet U.S. concerns about the
radar,'' Redman told reporters. ``... We listened to what they had
to say. Unfortunately, the Soviet experts did not have any new
proposals.''
   As a result, the spokesman said, the United States reserved its
right under international law ``to take appropriate and
proportionate responses'' to the Soviet violation. ``We have not
foreclosed the option of declaring that violation a material
breach,'' he said.
   Such a declaration could lead to U.S. nullification of the ABM
treaty, which many arms control specialists consider to be a
landmark in deterring nuclear war.
   Administration officials were sharply divided last spring on
whether to threaten the Soviets with the declaration. Eventually,
President Reagan decided on a postponement while encouraging Moscow
to dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar.
   Even some of the administration's sharpest critics consider the
facility in violation of the treaty. But they say the United States
is engaged in questionable radar operations itself in Britain and in
Greenland.
   ``The Krasnoyarsk radar is a violation of the ABM treaty,''
Redman said. ``We've made it clear that violations must be corrected
without delay.''
   The spokesman added: ``Based on what we heard today, we continue
to believe strongly that the U.S. criteria can only be met by
dismantlement of the radar and destruction of the transmitter and
receiver.''

   Hickory, dickory, dock. The mice are
eating the pot.
   The Shelby County Sheriff's Department says a gang of rodents has
infiltrated the agency's storage room and pilfered bags of marijuana
kept as evidence for upcoming trials.
   Authorities believe the perpetrators are mice seeking refuge from
the cold. It's not the first time this has happened, said Sheriff
Rick D. Isgrigg. ``But this year is the worst,'' he said.
   The rodents have chewed through several 29-ounce and 1-pound bags
of marijuana.
   ``They're playing havoc with the stuff,'' Isgrigg said Tuesday.
``From all indications, they must be rolling in it.''
   The mice have discriminating tastes, however. They've passed up a
bag of potato chips held as evidence in a grocery burglary, in this
area southeast of Indianapolis.
   Because the pests refuse to rat on each other, Isgrigg has placed
mounds of rodent-killer in the 20-by-25-foot property room.
   ``We have to nip this in the bud _ or nip it in the bag,'' the
sheriff said.

   Now that he's captured, if the legendary
``16-foot Wadsworth gator'' could talk he might tell these residents
east of Reno a couple of things.
   First, he's a South American caiman who's only 3 feet long and 10
pounds.
   Second, he likes cheeseburgers much better than the chicken bait
that's been set out for him as lures in the Truckee River where's
he's been vacationing for the past few weeks.
   Nevada Game Warden Steve Albert took custody Tuesday of the
caiman, a reptile cousin of the alligator. Albert said he would try
to find a new home for the caiman in a zoo or aquarium.
   The reptile was first spotted in the river Oct. 14 and was
probably dumped there by someone who tired of it as a pet, Albert
said.
   Since the first sighting, Wadsworth residents had believed that
the reptile was an alligator. The town's storytellers eventually
talked the legendary beast up to a 16-footer.
   The state Department of Wildlife became involved and set chicken
meat bait traps along the river, but to no avail.
   But last week, Robert Lester, 22, of Sparks and John Warner, 26,
of Reno captured the caiman while fishing for trout.
   Warner said he kept the caiman in his bathtub and fed it
cheeseburgers hoping to make him a pet, even though that's illegal
in Nevada.
   But Warner finally decided to give up the caiman and collect a
$500 reward a Reno businessman had put up for the ``Wadsworth
gator.''
   Eddie Floyd, a University of Florida alumnus, said he offered the
money because the alligator is the mascot of the university's sports
team.
   Floyd paid the reward Tuesday then immediately gave up custody of
the caiman to wildlife officials.
   ``I can't take it back to Florida because there are no Florida
Fightin' Caimans,'' Floyd lamented. ``But I'm glad it's OK just the
same.''

   Every time Don Anderson steps up to a game on
the North Georgia Fair midway, some needy or sick child can start
looking for a new stuffed animal.
   Anderson has gotten so good at the games, he wins a new toy just
about every time he toes the line at the ring toss or milk can game.
   Anderson has won an average of 50 stuffed animals each year at
the North Georgia Fair. This year, he won 78.
   Many of the green frogs, purple pandas and brown bears from this
year's fair are strewn around the Anderson home in Dalton.
   Most are awaiting auction at the Dalton Shrine Club, over which
Anderson presides. Proceeds from the auction are donated to the
Scottish Rite Children's Hospital in Atlanta. Other stuffed toys
will be donated directly to children at the hospital.
   The remaining stuffed animals will become Christmas presents for
needy families in the Dalton area.
   Anderson, the 40-year-old co-owner of a carpet outlet, got hooked
on playing midway games when he and his family visited Opryland in
Nashville, Tenn. Playing a game called Whack-A-Mole, he found he
could wield a cleaver and bash the mechanical ``moles'' with ease.
   ``I have quick reflexes,'' he said.
   He estimated he spent $150 to $160 playing the games this year.
   ``He'd rather do this than go on vacation,'' his wife said.

<HEAD>Productivity on the Rise Despite Bad Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's productivity rose by an annual
rate of 1.3 percent from July through September, the government said
Wednesday, reversing a second quarter decline when new employment
had outpaced increases in goods and services.
   But analysts cautioned that the long-term trend of anemic
productivity growth offers little hope for lifting Americans'
standard of living or increasing U.S. competitiveness overseas.
   Output of goods and services by non-farm businesses rose at an
annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, while the number of
hours worked increased only 1.5 percent, the Labor Department said.
   But the over-the-year productivity improvement has been only 0.8
percent, the government said. Revised figures showed that
productivity dropped 2.4 percent in the second quarter _ much worse
than the 1.4 percent decline estimated previously.
   ``Despite the strong growth of the economy over the past year,
there's still no significant change in a the weak trend in
productivity that we've seen since 1973,'' said Larry Chimerine,
chairman of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., economic consulting
firm.
   ``Productivity growth averaging 1 percent a year remains this
country's major economic problem,'' he said. ``Until we get it on a
stronger upward trend, we're not going to see any increase in real
wages or in our international competitiveness.''
   Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the
second quarter on hourly wage and benefit increases averaging 5.4
percent annually. Last year, businesses were able to restrain their
labor cost increases to only 3.1 percent, with a 3.8 percent
increase in hourly compensation to workers.
   Roger Brinner, an economist for Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass., said Americans can expect to see a pattern in the near future
in which productivity gains offset only a small portion of recent
increases in wages.
   ``It confirms that our core inflation rate has moved up, locked
in at 4 percent and probably is headed to 5 percent unless OPEC (the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) dissolves,'' Brinner
said.
   Manufacturers, which account for one-fourth of the nation's
economic output, continue to fare much better that businesses
generally in both improving their productivity and in keeping a lid
on labor costs.
   Productivity in the nation's factories rose at an annual rate of
4.3 percent in the second quarter on a 6.5 percent boost in the
volume of goods coming off assembly lines with only a 2.1 percent
increase in hours worked.
   Factory wages and benefits rose at a slower 4.6 percent annual
rate when compared with those of all workers in private industry,
enabling manufacturers to restrain their labor cost increases to
only 0.3 percent in the third quarter and 0.7 percent over the past
12 months.
   After accounting for inflation, factory workers have 0.3 percent
less buying power for each hour of work than they had a year ago,
while workers in private industry in general have 0.7 percent more
buying power, the Labor Department said.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist for Merrill Lynch, said the
manufacturing productivity gains are the payoff to the mergers,
acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that have wreaked havoc on some
parts of the economy.
   ``There were a lot of corporate bureaucracies that needed a lot
of slimming,'' he said. ``As a result, manufacturing is the most
vital part of the U.S. economy this year and its productivity growth
in the 1980s has been superior to the three previous decades.''
   Steinberg, however, noted that the export boom and wave of
capital spending that has helped spur manufacturing's rebound the
past two years show signs of slowing down.
   The Commerce Department, for example, reported Wednesday that
orders to U.S. factories dropped 1.9 percent or by $4.4 billion in
September after rising by 3.2 percent in August.
   And orders for non-defense capital goods, a key indicator of
business investment plans, fell by 10 percent to $34.9 billion for
the month.
   New home sales also fell a dramatic 7.8 percent in September _
the biggest decline in 16 months _ to seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 659,000 units, the Commerce Department said.

<HEAD>Vietnam To Return Remains That May Be U.S. MIAs</HEAD>

   A Vietnamese official said his nation on
Thursday will turn over to the United States 23 sets of remains that
may be those of Americans missing from the Vietnam War.
   A U.S. Embassy official confirmed Wednesday that remains would be
handed over, but put the number at 21.
   The remains include the two sets that U.S.-Vietnamese teams
recovered during last month's unprecedented joint field
investigations in northern Vietnam, Tran Viet Tan, consul general of
the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, said Wednesday.
   The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity. Sources said
Vietnam has given the United States a list of at least nine names
associated with the remains.
   A U.S. military team is to receive the remains in a ceremony at
Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi, Vietnam's capital. They will be loaded
onto a military plane for the flight to Honolulu, where an Army
laboratory tries to confirm the preliminary analyses done by the
Vietnamese.
   Thursday's return would be among the largest since the January
1973 Paris Peace Accords ended U.S. military involvement in the war.
The communists defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in
April 1975.
   Maj. Dan Trout, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command, said
that since the Paris accords, the United States has received the
identified remains of 196 missing personnel, including 168 from
Vietnam, 26 from Laos and two from China. That leaves 2,387
Americans missing in action in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
   In August 1987, Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, and
a special U.S. presidential envoy, retired Gen. John W. Vessey,
reached agreement to hasten cooperation on the MIA issue.
   Trout said the United States has identified 25 missing Americans
among the 77 remains Vietnam has returned since the agreement. The
most recent handover was of 25 remains on July 13.
   U.S. officials said they were pleased with the quickened pace of
progress on the MIA issue. But Ted Sampley, head of the National
Steering Committee for American War Veterans, on Wednesday accused
the Vietnamese of using turnovers for political ends.
   ``They are timing it for the presidential election,'' he said in
a telephone call from the United States. The committee, a private
lobbying group, has accused Washington of pursuing only the remains
of the dead while covering up purported evidence of Americans still
held prisoner in Indochina.
   U.S. and Vietnamese experts are winding up their second joint
field investigation, Trout said. He said the seven U.S. military
experts are to return to Bangkok Thursday after the 10-day probe of
areas west of Hanoi.
   Trout said the teams were inspecting U.S. warplane crash sites
and other areas to try to resolve ``discrepancy cases'' _ those in
which the United States says there is evidence that Vietnamese
authorities have information on the servicemen's fate.
   Most American losses in northern Vietnam were airmen shot down
during bombing runs.

<HEAD>Gov't Releases Nearly 700 People on Eve Of Referendum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 700 people arrested during last
month's riots were set free Wednesday, the eve of a national
referendum destined to alter the country's political landscape.
   Thursday's referendum, if approved, would introduce reforms
promised by President Chadli Bendjedid after six days of October
rioting left 176 people dead by official count.
   More than 150 people were injured and 3,000 arrested in violence
prompted by unemployment, shortages of food and housing, and a
declining standard of living in this North African nation of 25
million people.
   The government said 1,500 people previously had been released,
including a large number of children picked up during the
demonstrations throughout Algeria, a country about three times the
size of Texas.
   Earlier this week, authorities said the 1,500 still in prison
would be freed Wednesday. By evening the Justice Ministry had
announced several separate releases totaling 694 people. A Justice
Ministry spokesman reached by telephone said the rest would be let
go during the day, but could not say when.
   Algeria's state-controlled economy has been stricken by the
decline in the price of oil, the resource that accounts for about 95
percent of Algeria's export earnings.
   Bendjedid has said Algeria must change the way it is governed
before it can enact the economic reforms needed to diversify the
economy. The referendum, if approved, would change 14 articles of
the constitution.
   Algeria's sole legal political party, the National Liberation
Front, has controlled every aspect of national life since
independence from France in 1962.
   The goal of the reforms appears to be separating the party from
the day-to-day workings of the government by granting new powers to
the country's premier and making him answer for his policies to the
National Assembly. The referendum, if approved, would change 14
articles of the constitution.
   Voting in the referendum began in some far-flung regions of
southern Algeria Wednesday. The rest of the country's 12 million
eligible voters go to the polls Thursday.
   Political observers say Bendjedid's next move will be to open up
parliamentary elections to non-party candidates, although probably
not to other parties.
   Until now, all candidates in local and national elections had to
be nominated by the ruling party.
   In a speech Tuesday commemorating the Algerian war of
independence against France, Bendjedid said the series of reforms
when taken together will assure ``the participation of all society,
without violence or anarchy.''
   The party is scheduled to meet Nov. 27-28 to consider other
unannounced reforms.
   Voters return to the polls twice next year, first to approve the
changes made by the party congress and then in February to elect a
new president.
   Bendjedid is expected to be the only candidate on the
presidential ballot.
   In the past few months he has effectively neutralized his
opponents within the party's old guard. In a blow to hardliners
Saturday, Bendjedid fired Mohamed Cherif Massaadia, considered the
No. 2 man in the party and a leader of anti-reform forces.

   Sales of new homes suffered their steepest
plunge in more than a year in September, a 7.8 percent decline that
analysts blamed in part on the slowing economy.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes
dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 659,000 units in
September, down from an August sales pace of 715,000 units.
   It was only the third sales decline this year and the biggest
monthly setback since a 10.9 percent drop in May 1987.
   Analysts said the decline had been expected, given the fact that
overall economic growth is slowing in the second half of the year.
Sales of existing homes also fell during the month of September,
dropping 2.2 percent to an annual rate of 3.63 million units.
   Economists said both new and existing home sales had been
bolstered in previous months by fears among potential buyers that
interest rates would continue rising.
   ``There was a lot of anticipatory buying going on in June, July
and August because of people's expectations that interest rates
would keep on rising,'' said Richard Peach, an economist with the
Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Peach said some of those sales actually were borrowed from the
fall as people rushed to close deals before rates moved higher.
   In fact, mortgage rates have retreated somewhat in recent weeks
as inflationary fears have eased in financial markets because of
signs that economic growth is slowing.
   The Veterans Administration announced Monday it was cutting the
rate on VA mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10 percent
because of the recent trend toward lower rates. Surveys show lenders
in some regions of the country are offering conventional 30-year,
fixed-rate loans at below 10 percent, the first time they have
dipped to those levels since last spring.
   But economists said they did not expect rates to remain at these
levels for long. They predicted that further credit tightening moves
expected by the Federal Reserve after the election would push rates
higher.
   Peach said he expected fixed-rate mortgages would hit 11.75
percent by late next year.
   David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, said while he saw rates rising as well, he did not
think the increase would be enough to send the housing industry into
a slump.
   Instead, he predicted new home sales would decline to about
635,000 units in 1989, down only about 5 percent from the level he
is forecasting for this year.
   The big September sales decline was accompanied by a jump in
prices. The median price for new homes was $118,900, 8.1 percent
higher than the August sales price of $110,000. The September median
price, which means half the homes sold for more and half for less,
was 11.2 percent higher than a year ago, when the nationwide median
was $106,900.
   The average sales price also rose, climbing 4.5 percent to
$146,300 in September.
   The sales decline was led by a huge 27.8 percent plunge in sales
in the South, where sales were down to an annual rate of 216,000
units. Analysts were puzzled by the size of the decline, predicting
the figure might be revised upward in coming months.
   Sales in the Northeast dropped 12.7 percent to an annual rate of
89,000 units. The September sales pace was a steep 23.3 percent
below the sales level of a year ago, indicating, analysts said, that
the sales boom has cooled in that region of the country.
   Sales in the West bucked the national trend, rising by a sharp
17.3 percent to an annual rate of 258,000 units, reflecting booming
conditions in the California real estate markets.
   Sales in the Midwest were up by a more modest 1.1 percent to an
annual rate 96,000 units.

<HEAD>Egypt's Revolution Trial Adjourned for Two Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen men charged with terrorist acts,
including murder, against U.S. and Israeli diplomats pleaded
dinnocent Wednesday. The trial was adjourned for two months to give
attorneys time to prepare.
   Twenty men are charged in the case, but the two most prominent
defendants _ a son and a nephew of former President Gamal Abdel
Nasser _ left Egypt in 1987. No pleas were entered for them.
   Eleven defendants, including Khaled Abdel Nasser, son of the late
president, are charged with forming the clandestine Egypt's
Revolution group with the intent to murder.
   The indictment also accuses them of murder, of undermining
Egypt's security and of damaging its relations with the United
States and Israel.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to death.
   The other defendants, including Khaled's cousin, Gamal Shawky
Abdel Nasser, are charged with complicity in the alleged acts. They
could receive sentences up to life imprisonment, which under
Egyptian law is 25 years.
   At least 50 defense lawyers listened while Ragaa Araby, the
assistant attorney general, read the charges to the 18 defendants.
The accused stood in barred cages in the large courtroom, a
converted conference hall.
   After hearing defense motions in the three-hour session, the
three-man court adjourned the trial until Jan. 1, 1989, to give
lawyers time to read case files. The court also said it would issue
summonses for the missing Nassers and for witnesses.
   Thirteen lawyers represent the first defendant, Mahmoud Nour Din
Sayed Ali Suliman. A former Egyptian foreign service employee, he is
charged with organizing and heading Egypt's Revolution and with
participating in all the attacks.
   Charges against the 20 were filed in February and stem from four
attacks on Israeli and U.S. diplomats. Two Israelis were killed and
six were wounded in shootings between 1984 and 1986. Two American
diplomats were wounded in an attack in May 1987.
   Egypt's Revolution admitted all the attacks in communiques that
opposed Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel, criticized the United
States and professed the pan-Arab ideology nurtured by the late
president.

   Republican George Bush said Wednesday
that if he is elected next week, it would represent a ``mainstream
mandate'' from voters who rejected a leftist political philosophy of
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis.
   Republican National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, who was traveling
with the vice president through Midwestern battleground states,
spoke openly of the prospects of Bush's election by a landslide on
Nov. 8.
   ``The way it is going now, there is that possibility,'' he said,
cautioning that Bush cannot afford to take any state or any public
opinion poll for granted in the final days before the balloting.
   Addressing a boisterous rally of 5,000 people in former President
Ford's hometown, Bush poked fun at Dukakis engaging in what he
called ``a media blitz, free media'' as the campaign drew to a close.
   ``It seemed like he appeared on every television show except
`Wheel of Fortune','' Bush said jokingly. ``You see, he was afraid
that Vanna might turn over the L word.'' Vanna White is a hostess on
the popular TV game show.
   At campaign rallies in Michigan and Illinois, Bush tried
repeatedly to paste the ``L word'' or liberal tag on the Democratic
nominee and portray him as far removed from the mainstream of
traditional American values.
   ``I represent the mainstream, the mainstream (views) and the
mainstream values,'' Bush said. ``If I win, it will be a mainstream
mandate. That's what this election is about.''
   The GOP nominee was introduced by Ford, who assailed Dukakis ``an
insult to the memory of Harry Truman'' and ``an image of George
McGovern, Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter'' _ three Democrats who
suffered big election losses to Republican presidential candidates.
   Bush also made one of his rare public mentions of running mate
Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., during the campaign.
   He said Quayle, like steel, had been tempered by fire. ``My young
running mate has been through the fire, and his head is up and his
chin is high,'' Bush said.
   Earlier, in the affluent Chicago suburb of Prairie View, Ill.,
Bush told a lively rally of 4,000 people in a high school gymnasium
that he had ``heard the voice of America'' in his campaign travels
and that he had ``big dreams'' about America.
   He said a ``great divide'' separated his and Dukakis' views,
which he characterized as ``way out on the left side of the polical
spectrum.''
   Bush said he shared ``the values of the working men and women in
this country.''
   Noting that the students in the audience were receiving an
``outstanding education,'' Bush promised greater support for the
federal Head Start program for needy preschool children.
   Bush campaign aides were heartened by Chicago newspapers polls
showing him with a lead of six to nine percentage points over
Dukakis in Illinois, which has 24 electoral votes, and by another
survey indicating he was ahead by six points in Michigan, which has
20 electoral votes.
   Fahrenkopf said daily GOP tracking polls showed that for the past
few weeks, Dukakis could claim between 35 percent and 38 percent of
the vote.
   There is a ``base Democratic vote'' of 40 percent, Fahrenkopf
said, and Dukakis had been below that for some time.
   Fahrenkopf did not use the word ``landslide'' but said if Bush's
standing holds up across the country, a landslide victory is
possible.
   Spokeswoman Sheila Tate said the campaign was also satisified
with the decision of The Washington Post not to endorse either
candidate.
   She said Wednesay's rallies were an effort to ``shore it up and
fire up the troops.''

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three vacant and dilapidated apartment buildings
said to be havens for drug dealers have been demolished, marking the
end of a one-year campaign by Dallas police.
   Bulldozers demolished a 24-unit complex, a 10-unit building and a
duplex Tuesday.
   ``We started trying to do something about these places a year ago
today,'' said Lt. David Goelden, a police patrol supervisor.
   ``They've been a haven for drug dealers to smoke and sell their
dope. We can't keep closing our eyes to this,'' he added.
   Joe Johnson, who owns 100 apartment units in the same
neighborhood, said he, too, was happy to see the buildings
demolished because of the drug traffic.
   Johnson said it took repeated calls from him, neighbors and
police officers to persuade the city to order the buildings
demolished.
   Demolition of dilapidated, vacant structures that provide cover
for drug dealers is a tactic increasingly being used to combat
drug-related crime in other cities, including Houston, Miami, New
York and Los Angeles.
   Goelden conceded that tearing down the residences might only push
the dealers to other locations, but he said police also will work on
those places.

<HEAD>Auctioneer Proposes Public Auction for Sears Tower</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump claims he's not interested in the
Sears Tower, and the Japanese are wary of owning anything so
symbolic of America. But they'd all be there if a public auction
were held, says a man who wants to wield the gavel.
   Real estate auctioneer Joel Zegart is proposing that Sears,
Roebuck and Co. sell the world's tallest building at auction,
claiming that the nation's largest retailer would get the best price
that way.
   Sears announced Monday it would sell its famed 110-story
headquarters tower as part of a corporate restructuring designed to
boost profits. The 14-year-old building, which rises 1,450 feet
above the downtown Loop, has been valued at up to $1.8 billion.
   Even those who say they're not interested _ like New York real
estate magnate Trump, several Japanese real estate firms, and JMB
Realty Corp., which owns Water Tower Place, the city's glitzy
downtown shopping complex _ are just playing coy, he believes.
   ``I think it's a smokescreen,'' Zegart, president of JBS &
Associates Inc., said Wednesday of the many denials among those seen
as the most likely bidders for the building.
   ``I think a lot of people are interested and they just aren't
showing their cards yet.''
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather said the company had received
``a number of inquiries'' following its announcement, but he
wouldn't reveal the identities of the interested parties.
   Nor would Fairweather comment on the auction idea.
   ``I don't want to laugh on the record,'' he said.
   Fairweather said the sale, which is being handled by Goldman,
Sachs & Co. in conjunction with Sears' own Coldwell Banker real
estate and Dean Witter Reynolds financial units, would be negotiated
privately with selected prospective buyers who would be invited to
submit bids.
   The skyscraper would continue to serve as corporate headquarters
for Sears, although the 8,000-employee Sears Merchandise Group would
be moved to smaller, less expensive facilities over the next several
years, leaving only about 600 Sears workers in the tower.
   Zegart, whose firm specializes in auctions of large investment
properties, said a public auction open to all would generate
tremendous interest and result in a sale at the highest price Sears
could hope to receive.
   He said he would start the bidding at $800 million.
   Zegart, comparing the one-of-a-kind Sears Tower to the Mona Lisa,
said an auction of the building could be as lucrative as the 1987
auction of Vincent van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was to the seller in
that case.
   Japan's Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. stunned the art
world when it paid $40 million for ``Sunflowers'' in March 1987;
later in the year, an unidentified bidder paid even more for another
van Gogh.
   ``The Sears Tower is a building that you'll never see reproduced
again,'' Zegart said. ``You're buying a piece of Chicago when you
buy the Sears Tower. It's the gem of the downtown. It's history,
it's a landmark, it's known around the world.''
   Several Japanese firms say those are precisely the qualities that
make them wary.
   ``Buying such a building is not the same as buying
`Sunflowers,''' Tokyo-based investment analyst Masahiko Muranaka
told the Chicago Tribune. ``This is like buying a piece of America's
heart.''
   The Trump Organization, which was also seen as a likely bidder
for the tower, ``is not interested in the Sears building,'' said
spokeswoman Norma Foerderer.
   And neither is JMB, one of the nation's largest real-estate
invesment firms, said spokeswoman Marion Jack.

   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods
fell 1.9 percent in September, reflecting the volatility of demand
for jet aircraft, the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
goods fell to $222.6 billion in September, $4.4 billion below the
August level.
   Through the summer, factory orders each month have been buffeted
by rising and falling levels of demand for aircraft. August orders
had risen a sharp 3.2 percent because of a jump in the
transportation category, which includes aircraft.
   Without the volatile transportation sector, total orders would
have risen a more modest 0.9 percent in August and would have
declined 0.5 percent in September.
   The manufacturing sector has been one of the stars of the economy
this year as U.S. factories have benefited from a boom in export
sales. However, many economists believe this strength is beginning
to ebb and they are predicting slower overall economic growth for
next year.
   But Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said that even with the
orders decline in September, the backlog of unfilled orders rose,
indicating production should remain strong in coming months.
   ``A one-month drop in orders after such a strong expansion is not
very meaningful,'' Ortner said. ``The order books are still
expanding and there is no better incentive for increasing production
and employment than a fat order book.''
   In September, transportation orders fell 9.8 percent to $31.3
billion. Orders for aircraft dropped by 11.5 percent, while orders
for military ships and tanks, a smaller category, also declined
sharply.
   The overall defense category fell by 12.5 percent to $7 billion
in September, but some analysts suggested that this was a
statistical quirk related to the close of the government's fiscal
year. They predicted defense orders would resume rising in coming
months.
   Discounting defense, total orders would have dropped by 1.5
percent, the biggest setback in the civilian category since a 2.9
percent drop in January 1987.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good
indicator of industry investment plans, fell 10 percent to $34.9
billion, but still remained 18 percent higher than a year ago.
   This sector has provided much of the momentum for economic growth
this year as industries have boosted investment to meet increased
demand from an export boom.
   Orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or mores
years, fell 3.2 percent to $118.9 billion. This was a slight
improvement from a preliminary report last week that had put the
decline at 4.1 percent.
   Orders for non-durable goods dipped 0.5 percent to $103.7
billion, reflecting declines in orders for chemicals and petroleum
products.
   Shipments of manufactured goods dipped a slight 0.1 percent in
September to $221.4 billion.

<HEAD>Thousands Gather at Former U.S. Embassy; Chant `Death to America'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Iranians chanting ``Death to
America!'' rallied Wednesday in the compound of the former U.S.
Embassy in Tehran on the eve of the anniversary of its seizure by
militant students, a news agency said.
   Followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini stormed the embassy on
Nov. 4, 1979, and held 52 U.S. diplomats hostage for 444 days.
   The rally was held two days early because this year's anniversary
falls on Friday, the Moslem sabbath, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   IRNA said the demonstrators chanted slogans against Britain, the
Soviet Union and Israel, and burned an effigy of Uncle Sam and the
U.S. flag in the compound of what Iranians call ``Laneh Jassoussi,''
or ``the den of spies.''
   On Sunday, Iran's parliament declared Nov. 4 ``the day of the
campaign against global arrogance,'' the Iranians' phrase for the
United States.
   That date is also important in Iran's revolutionary calendar. On
Nov. 4, 1963, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi exiled Khomeini and on that
date 15 years later, hundreds of the shah's opponents were killed or
wounded in Tehran when troops fired on demonstrators.
   The news agency said Wednesday's rally was led by religious and
parliamentary figures. The rally began at Tehran University.
Demonstrators then marched to the walled compound in central Tehran.
   Leaders of the demonstration read out an eight-point resolution
declaring that U.S. support for the shah's pro-Western government,
the freezing of Iranian assets worth billions of dollars in the
United States and Washington's anti-Iranian policies ``will never be
forgotten.''
   The resolution accused the United States of aiding Iraq in the
8-year-old gulf war and declared that U.S. naval attacks on Iranian
vessels in the gulf before the Aug. 20 cease-fire, and particularly
the shooting down of an Iranian airliner July 3, killing all 290
people aboard, ``will be remembered.''
   Parts of the wreckage of the Iran Air Airbus A300 were displayed
during the demonstration, IRNA reported.

   Despite the pending shutdown of the sole
supplier of a fiber used in space shuttle rocket nozzles, the maker
of the shuttle motors said Wednesday at least 10 more shuttles can
be launched as planned.
   ``We have enough material on hand or on order for 11 flights out
of our current contract of 13,'' Morton Thiokol Inc. Aerospace Group
spokesman Rocky Raab said from Ogden, Utah. ``But the number will be
10 now, since we've flown Discovery.''
   The 10 flights are scheduled to be made through December 1989,
Raab said.
   Morton Thiokol and other aerospace contractors, along with NASA
and the Department of Defense, were talking with Avtex Fibers Inc.,
officials said. Avtex, based in Valley Forge, Pa., announced this
week it will close its plant here Thursday.
   ``I've never had a job where they do you like this. No warning,
no nothing. You find out on your own,'' said Deanna Green, who said
she learned about the plant's pending closing Monday from friends.
   The move would put 1,300 people out of work and choke off the
only supply of a rayon fiber used in rocket nozzles.
   ``Practically every project we have uses it in the nozzle,'' Raab
said. ``It's safe to say billions of dollars of projects.''
   Other Morton Thiokol projects that use the rayon fiber include
the small ICBM, the Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missile
and the HARM and Standard tactical missiles, Raab said. Morton
Thiokol was trying to determine Wednesday the overall impact to each
of its government contracts if the plant does close.
   ``We're still trying to pull all that together,'' Raab said. The
fiber earmarked for shuttle nozzles will not be transferred to any
of the defense rockets, he said.
   NASA, the military and aerospace contractors initially found it
difficult to determine how much of the fiber is on hand, because it
is handled by three more layers of contractors who weave it and
treat it for heat resistance before it's formed into rocket nozzles.
   NASA officials have said the talks with Avtex are aimed at
ensuring the supply of the fiber. The company's chairman, John N.
Gregg, has not returned repeated phone calls from The Associated
Press over the last several days.
   A NASA spokesman at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., confirmed Wednesday that talks were under way, but
said he could provide no details.
   ``I really don't know what the discussions are leading to,'' Dave
Drachlis said. ``I know the government and Avtex are discussing
options and looking at what could be done.''
   Another NASA spokesman, Jerry Berg, has said keeping Avtex's
rayon fiber operation in business was one possibility officials
could be exploring.
   Avtex spokesman John Kelly in New York has said the Front Royal
plant is the only Avtex facility equipped to make the fiber. The
necessary equipment could not be moved to Avtex's plant in
Lewistown, Pa., which the company is keeping in operation, Kelly
said.

<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court judge who owns shares in
Union Carbide Corp.'s Indian subsidiary withdrew Wednesday from
hearing an appeal on whether the firm should pay interim relief to
victims of the Bhopal gas leak.
   ``I thought it was proper to let the court know that I hold
shares, and I also thought it proper to withdraw myself from the
case,'' Justice Madhukar Hiralal Kania told The Associated Press.
   ``I wanted to withdraw because something may be said later,'' he
said.
   He was replaced by Justice N.D. Ojha.
   The Supreme Court is hearing an appeal of a lower court's order
directing the Danbury, Conn.-based company to pay interim relief.
More than 3,100 people died and 20,000 were seriously affected by
toxic methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from a pesticide plant in
the central Indian city of Bhopal on Dec. 3, 1984.
   The plant belonged to an Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide.
   ``I was told that my holding shares has nothing to do with the
case, but I thought I should not be a party to it (case),'' Kania
said by telephone.
   He refused to say how many shares he holds, but Press Trust of
India news agency said it was ``small.'' The agency did not give
specifics.
   Outside the court in New Delhi, about 100 victims silently
protested the court's decision to hear the appeal. They sat behind
huge placards showing dead and ailing victims of the gas leak.
   In 1986, the Indian government filed a $3 billion civil suit
against Union Carbide, claiming the leak was caused by negligence.
Union Carbide said the disaster was a result of sabotage by a
disgruntled employee.
   A district court hearing the suit last year ordered Union Carbide
to pay $269 million to victims of the disaster as interim relief.
The company appealed to the High Court of Madhya Pradesh state,
which lowered the payment to $192 million.
   A five-judge panel Supreme Court panel headed by Chief Justice
Raghunandan S. Pathak on Tuesday began hearing appeals by Union
Carbide against the payment and by the Indian government against the
lowering of the amount.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of radical students staged
campus rallies or battled police Wednesday to demand the arrest of
former President Chun Doo-hwan on corruption charges.
   National police director Cho Jong-suk issued a statement warning
against the student activism and said authorities would ``harshly
deal with anybody found involved in illegal rallies and
demonstrations.''
   Police released no figures, but local news reports said about
6,000 students from 20 universities took part in various
anti-government protests in Seoul and elsewhere. No arrests were
reported.
   Anti-government demonstrations have been escalating in recent
weeks. Radicals have threatened to raid Chun's house in Seoul on
Thursday, National Students Day.
   About 4,000 police surrounded Chun's house and began checking
passers-by.
   Thousands more police were deployed in the capital after
authorities were told that radical students might try to occupy
major government offices and foreign diplomatic missions.
   Student leaders said they organized ``save-the-nation suicide
squads'' to assault Chun's house with firebombs and homemade
explosives. Major street protests were planned near Chun's house,
they said.
   The threats came on the eve of President Roh Tae-woo's departure
on an 11-day trip to Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Brunei.
   Roh told legislators Wednesday his government will increase
efforts to ferret out all corruption and irregularities allegedly
committed under Chun's seven-year tenure.
   The president said he would oppose any political revenge against
his predecessor.
   Local newspapers, quoting unnamed senior government officials,
said some of Chun's family members might be arrested on corruption
charges before Roh returns home from the overseas trip Nov. 14.
   Despite continuing government investigations of past corruption
and irregularities, critics argue that the Roh adminstration is
reluctant to divulge alleged corruption involving Chun, his family
members and associates.
   Roh and Chun, both former army genrals, have been close friends
since they were classmates at Korea Military Academy in the 1950s.
Roh succeeded Chun, who stepped down at the end of a seven-year term
in February.
   Chun has come under public fire for his alleged misuse of power
and involvement in financial and other scandals. One of his
brothers, Chun Kyong-hwan, has been sentenced to seven years'
imprisonment for taking bribes and embezzling millions of dollars of
official funds.

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on Wednesday endorsed

   The newspaper, in an editorial, said Dukakis and Bentsen
``present a more concerned approach to the nation's unfinished
business than do their Republican opponents.''
   ``We worry that the Bush campaign is an indication of how he
would lead the country,'' the newapaper said. ``He has said he wants
to preside over a kinder, gentler nation. Yet we have seen in his
campaign appeals to the harsher instincts.''
   The Star-Bulletin, a Gannett newspaper, said it was the first
time ``in modern memory'' that it has endorsed a Democrat for
president.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl will brief
French President Francois Mitterrand on his recent talks in the
Kremlin when they meet here on Thursday and Friday.
   Relations with Moscow and a common policy toward the Soviet Union
are likely to top the agenda for the 52nd French-German summit,
according to West German officials.
   Kohl visited Moscow last month for wide-ranging talks with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev. Mitterrand is scheduled to visit Moscow
later this month.
   West German government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Kohl will
give Mitterrand an extensive briefing on his talks with Gorbachev.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is a leading
proponent of closer relations with the Soviet Union, stressing that
West Europeans should ``take Gorbachev at his word.''
   European Economic Community plans to lift many internal trade
barriers in 1992 will also be a main topic of the French-German
talks.
   Foreign policy initiatives, including plans to open a joint
embassy in Mongolia, will also part of the consultations.
   Kohl and Mitterrand, who hold talks regularly several times a
year, also met Tuesday in Aachen, when they received the Charlemagne
Prize, a distinction awarded for achievements in fostering European
unity.
   Speaking at the Aachen ceremony, Kohl called for closer
cooperation between West Germany and France in formulating a ``joint
European policy'' toward the Soviet Union and its European allies.
   Kolh said ``the new developments in the East have opened
opportunities that are filling us with hope.''
   The two leaders will also discuss projects leading to the
creation of a single market within the 12 EEC member countries.
   Proposals for a single European currency and a European central
bank have run into opposition from the fiercely independent
Bundesbank, West Germany's influential central bank.
   Bundesbank chief Karl Otto Poehl has recently voiced fears that a
European central bank could fall under too much government influence.
   France is a strong supporter of more European monetary
integration.

<TEXT>
   Arab nations saw the apparent victory of
right-wing parties in Israel's elections as a setback for peace, but
Egypt said Wednesday it will continue seeking a path to stability in
the Middle East.
   The swing to the right in Israel gave Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and his Likud bloc the chance to form a government with the
aid of small religious parties, which gained seats in the election.
Likud and the rival Labor Party have been in a fractious ``national
unity'' coalition since 1984.
   Jordan's foreign minister, Taher Masri, told The Associated
Press: ``We think such a government will be a blow to the efforts of
peace, especially at this time when everyone _ the two superpowers,
the world at large _ is becoming more flexible about reaching the
basis for a peaceful settlement.''
   Before Tuesday's election, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestine
Liberation Organization had expressed indirect support for Labor,
led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and its leftist allies.
   Peres has said he would accept an international conference on the
Middle East, which Arab nations demand, and is willing to trade some
occupied territory for peace. Shamir opposes a conference and vows
never to give up the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Israel in 1967.
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat said the election result ``makes no
difference'' and the Palestinian uprising in Israel's occupied
territories would continue.
   ``There is no difference in my opinion between Peres and
Shamir,'' said Arafat, who was in Rome for a meeting with Italian
Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti. ``Shamir is using the iron fist
and (Defense Minister Yithzak) Rabin with Peres is using the same
iron fist, and don't forget that during the whole last period we are
facing the two parties in the same cabinet.''
   A commentary distributed by Wafa, the PLO news agency, called the
election result ``a fatal blow for peace'' and declared: ``We expect
more intransigence, hate and terrorism with a Likud government.''
   Said Kenaan, a West Bank businessman who supports the PLO,
declared: ``It's obvious Israelis don't want peace, but we will hit
back. The moderate voice in the Palestinian camp is finished.''
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr, said: ``The
Palestinians will now only intensify their efforts to end the
occupation and achieve national rights.''
   Palestinians living in the occupied territories began a rebellion
against Israeli rule Dec. 8, 1987, that has cost the lives of 10
Israelis and more than 300 Palestinians. The election focused on the
uprising and how to achieve peace with the Arabs.
   ``The Likud program is built on illusions,'' said Ahmed
Abdul-Rahman, a spokesman at PLO headquarters in Tunisia. ``It
promises Israelis both security and the continuation of the
occupation, while the facts have proved that Israel will not have
peace as long as it continues the occupation.''
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt said in Cairo,
however, that the outcome ``represents the will of the Israeli
voters ... and it is natural that we deal with any new government
they choose. Egypt also is anxious to emphasize the need for action
to carry on with the peace process to achieve stability in the
region.''
   Egypt, under the leadership of President Anwar Sadat, is the only
Arab nation to have made a peace treaty with Israel. The treaty was
signed in 1979 and assassins who opposed it killed Sadat in 1981.
   Syria's state radio said: ``The results of the elections are not
in favor of just and lasting peace in the Middle East, nor are they
in favor of settling the differences between Likud and Labor on the
international peace conference and on the future of the occupied
territories.''
   Mohammed Milhem of the PLO executive committee said in Amman a
Likud government would be even tougher on protesters in the occupied
lands, where the PLO hopes to establish a Palestinian state, and
reaction to the bloodshed might bring peace closer.
   The former mayor of Halhoul in the West Bank, who was deported in
1980, said Wednesday: ``With Shamir I think there may be more
chances for peaceful settlement than (with) Peres. He's going to
escalate. He's going to kill more people, deport more people'' and
the international community might ``do something about it.''
   ``The government of Shamir is an evil, but this evil may do more
good than Peres,'' Milhem said.
   Many Jordanians spent the night tuned to Israel's radio and
television for election results.
   Among them was Carlos Dimes, who represented Bethlehem in
Jordan's parliament before King Hussein severed administrative ties
to the occupied territories last summer.
   ``The Palestinians should keep on fighting to win the intefadeh
... and never wait for the Israeli and U.S. elections to achieve
that for them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Would Fight AIDS Discrimination, Aide Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush would use the power of the
presidency to push for federal legislation banning discrimination
against people with the AIDS virus, the Bush campaign's top domestic
affairs adviser said Wednesday.
   Deborah Steelman's assertion was an extension of Bush's own
support for the White House AIDS commission's recommendation last
summer calling for a federal antidiscrimination law as the
foundation for a more aggressive fight against the disease.
   Meeting with a small group of reporters, Steelman was reminded
that conservative Republicans _ particularly Sen. Jesse Helms of
North Carolina and Rep. William E. Dannemeyer _ were successful in
blocking antidiscrimination provisions during the just-ended 100th
Congress.
   Would Bush use the power of the White House to push the issue in
Congress? she was asked.
   ``Sure,'' she said. ``That's the name of the game.''
   She said Bush and Dannemeyer have discussed the issue and ``do
disagree fairly heartily.''
   Steelman said confidentiality laws regarding AIDS testing need to
remain a matter for states, largely because they are so closely
linked to insurance regulation and other state functions.
   But since discrimination against people infected with the AIDS
virus _ or HIV _ is the ``down side'' to breached confidentiality,
she said, an overarching federal ban against such discrimination is
needed.
   Bush held a private dinner with Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
and National Institutes of Health AIDS chief Anthony Fauci a few
days before making a point on the campaign trail of backing the AIDS
commission's call for antidiscrimination legislation.
   Neither President Reagan, nor any other top White House official,
has taken such a position.
   The premise of public and private health officials in backing
strong antidiscrimination laws is that people likely to be carrying
the virus will not submit to the AIDS test for fear the results
would become public, and that that will make the epidemic harder to
track and fight.
   One of the commission's main criticisms of Reagan administration
health policies was that budget planning for AIDS research and
education was filtered through the normal bureaucratic process that
often results in requests originated by scientists being watered
down before they reach the White House.
   Asked about the stance a President Bush would take in dealing
with government health officials' requests for ammunition to fight
AIDS, Steelman said he ``probably will talk to them personally.''

<HEAD>High Court Asked To Uphold Suits Against Social Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, hearing a case involving a
child beaten and crippled by his father, was told Wednesday that
suits against government social agencies are constitutional if
caseworkers fail to act to protect someone they know is in peril.
   Attorney Donald James Sullivan asked to court to uphold a suit by
the mother of nine-year-old Joshua DeShaney _ who was beaten so
severely by his father that he can only make awkward movements and
guttural sounds.
   Sullivan told the court that Winnebago County, Wis., social
welfare officials deprived the youth of his due process rights when
they ``refused to help the child'' five years ago, even while
knowing he was in ``immediate need of medical care.''
   The court, which took the case under advisement, was asked to
decide whether the Costitution permits suits against social agencies
for such alleged gross negligence.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out the
suit by Melody DeShaney, of Cheyenne, Wyo., against the Winnebago
County Department of Social Services and two of its employees.
   Mark J. Mingo, representing the social agency, said the
Constitution would not support suits that subjected local
governments to ``massive new areas of exposure.''
   And he said that the job of social workers would be almost
impossible if they could be sued every time they make the wrong
decision.
   ``Social workers operate on the razor's edge,'' Mingo said.
``They must respond to the Constitutional right of parents in
management of their child.''
   He said a social worker ``must walk a fine line to prevent the
door from being slammed in her face to prevent future involvement.''
   Sullivan said he was not arguing the state has a ``broad
constitutional mandate to be all things to all people.''
   A government's ``affirmative constitutional duty,'' he said, came
only when there was ``extensive danger'' to the child and ``abundant
actual knowledge'' by the government _ knowledge he said was present
in this case.
   ``If the parents' rights are recognized, why should the rights of
the child be less recognized?'' he asked.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said it seemed Sullivan's argument
``would have a real deterrent effect'' on state agencies.
   Sullivan argued that ``It's okay'' for a social worker to ``guess
wrong.'' But he contended Joshua's caseworker was so keenly aware of
his danger that she once worried that she would pick up the phone
one day and learn the boy was dead.
   Asked by Justice John Paul Stevens, ``When did the constitutional
violation occur?'' Sullivan said it was when the agency allowed
Joshua to return home to his father after a three-day hospital stay
in 1983 for suspected child abuse.
   Mingo said the child went back because no hard evidence of abuse
was discovered, and the law required that the boy be sent home.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist told Sullivan, ``I don't see
how you turn around the limitations on the state to a duty on the
state.''
   The boy's father, Randy DeShaney, was convicted of felony battery
and child abuse and sentenced to two consecutive two-year prison
terms. He served about two years and eight months before he was
released in September 1987.
   Joshua remains in custody of the county and has no use of his
legs or one arm, and can only make awkward movements with one hand.
   The 7th circuit, in dismissing the suit, said, ``If the
defendants, though blameworthy, did not cause Joshua's injuries,
they cannot be said to have deprived him of his liberty.''
   The court said it was ``unlikely'' that the caseworker assigned
to Joshua did the boy ``any good at all. But it is most unlikely
that it did him any harm. She merely failed to protect him from his
bestial father.''

<HEAD>More Food Foreseen for Hungry in Southeast Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About half the world's hungriest people _ 350
million of them _ live in India and Bangladesh, but 140 million of
them are on land with great promise of more farm production in the
1990s, a food policy official said Wednesday.
   John A. Mellor, director of the International Food Policy
Research Institute, said experts now know how to get more crops out
of the valleys of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, where many of
the world's poorest and hungriest people are concentrated.
   ``Twenty years ago, it was premature to talk about eliminating
hunger and poverty in the world,'' Mellor, a former chief economist
for the U.S. Agency for International Development, told reporters.
``Now we have a base for doing it.''
   Mellor said it would be a long-term project _ 15 to 20 years _
based on developing improved varieties of grains and soybeans, as
well as better roads, bridges and other public works.
   Improving farming will have a multiplier effect on the growth of
incomes because farmers use most of their increased earnings in ways
that create more jobs, he said. ``The faster agriculture grows, the
faster its share of the economy declines,'' he explained.
   Mellor pointed to the example of the United States, where only 2
percent to 3 percent of the people are now in farming but production
of both food and industrial goods has increased tremendously since
the days when most Americans were farmers.
   To end poverty, people must get jobs in industry, he said.
   Mellor said farming in the Third World is dependent increasingly
on the market, and less on government control. Left-wing governments
help distribute land in the Third World but do not understand
farming, he said.
   ``Karl Marx was a city boy,'' Mellor explained.
   He calculated that of the 700 million undernourished people in
the world, 350 million live in Southeast Asia, 137 million in
Africa, 76 million in China, 72 million in Latin America, 34 million
in the Near East and 31 million in East Asia and the Pacific.
   Mellor's comments were based on a report he will deliver Friday
to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, an
organization of 13 organizations coordinated by the World Bank.

   The stepmother of a 5-year-old girl who choked to
death after allegedly being force-fed a ginger cake was held
Wednesday on $50,000 bail pending a hearing in the case.
   The death of Phenix Smith was Colorado's 19th reported
child-abuse fatality in 1988, one short of the record number
reported in 1982 and equaled in 1984 with two months to go in the
year.
   ``It's been a real bad year,'' said Jane Beveridge, administrator
of the state's child protection program.
   Phenix died in Children's Hospital on Saturday. Police reported
she apparently ``choked to death on a large amount of food'' and
also showed signs of possible sexual abuse.
   Phenix's stepmother, 31-year-old Beverly Smith, was accused of
force-feeding the girl as a punishment for sampling a ginger cake
without permission.
   The Adams County coroner performed an autopsy late Tuesday, but
District Attorney Jim Smith said results won't be released until
after charges are filed Thursday.
   Phenix's 12-year-old brother, 11-year-old stepsister and a
15-month-old half brother have been moved to foster homes.
   Statistics gathered by the National Committee for the Prevention
of Child Abuse in Chicago show that more children nationwide are
dying from abuse-related injuries.
   ``In 1987, we had more than 1,100 child abuse or neglect
fatalities,'' said Leslie Mitchel, an analyst with the national
organization. ``That's a 25 percent increase over 1985.''
   Mitchel said 30 percent to 60 percent of those deaths involve
cases that were known to child protection services before the deaths
occurred.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito received a blood transfusion
Wednesday and palace officials said his condition was basically
unchanged, although he is weak and underweight.
   Hirohito, 87, received nearly a pint of blood to improve his
anemia, said Kenji Maeda, spokesman for the Imperial Household
Agency.
   Since Hirohito fell ill with internal bleeding Sept. 19, he has
received more than 34 pints of blood.
   Maeda said that by late afternoon, the emperor was running a
fever of 100.4, well above his normal reading of 95.9, but he said
Hirohito's condition remained stable.
   A senior palace official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the emperor's physical strength was waning and that he only
weighs about 88 pounds.
   He also said doctors were finding it difficult to locate new
veins to use for blood transfusions and intravenous feeding.
   Hirohito, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has eaten no
solid food since Sept. 19 except for a few spoons of weak porridge.
   Palace doctors have said he is bleeding internally in the upper
intestinal area, where physicians performed a bypass operation in
September 1987.
   The palace official also confirmed the emperor's situation was
critical over the weekend, when his blood pressure plummeted to 84
over 34. A healthy person's blood pressure is about 120 over 80.
   Hirohito received a visit Wednesday from his elder son, Crown
Prince Akihito, and Crown Princess Michiko and their son, Prince
Hiro, second in line to the throne. Other imperial family members
called on the emperor during the day.
   Akihito, 54, has taken over all imperial duties, including
signing government bills and receiving foreign envoys and visiting
dignitaries.

<HEAD>Soviet Sailor Says He Likes Taiwan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet sailor captured 34 years ago by
Taiwan said Wednesday he enjoys living here and denied he had been
tortured.
   ``I have made many friends. Taiwan is prosperous and people here
are rich. I like this place.'' Vsevolod Vladihirovich Lopatyuk said
on an evening television show, speaking in Chinese and Russian.
   In an interview with the military-run China Television System, he
said the Taiwanese government had granted him and three colleagues
asylum and provided them with money, housing and entertainment.
   Lopatyuk said President Lee Teng-hui had approved his request to
become a Taiwan resident, and he soon will start teaching Russian at
a language center.
   Lopatyuk, 60, lives in a secluded compound protected by guards in
Ilan, a fishing village about 18 miles southwest of Taipei.
   He said he missed his parents and that although they are in the
Soviet Union, ``they live in my heart forever.''
   Lopatyuk denied charges by the other sailors that they had been
captured and tortured in prison.
   When the other sailors _ Vladimir Sablin, Boris Pianov, and
Vladimir Kniga _returned to Moscow in August, they told reporters
they had lived in horror during their long stay in Taiwan.
   ``They were made to look for days at hot white electric bulbs,
wild dances of the prison guards on prostrate bodies of the
prisoners whose feet and arms joints were squeezed tight,'' the
offical Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   Lopatyuk denied the Tass report and said the four stayed in the
compound together and were treated nicely.
   The four were among the crew of the tanker Tuapse that was
sailing for mainland China with a load of kerosene when Taiwanese
authorities seized it on June 23, 1954.
   Taiwan officials have said 29 Soviet crewmen were released in
1955 and by 1958, nine more had left for the United States and
Brazil after being granted asylum in those countries.
   Lopatyuk said he and his three colleagus had decided to stay in
Taiwan after U.S. officials rejected their immigration requests in
1954. He said he had no idea why the three wanted to leave Taiwan
after 34 years.
   Taiwan officials said the government respected the sailors' will
and helped them fly back to Moscow.
   The Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan in 1949 after
losing a civil war to Communists on the mainland, maintains a
staunch anti-communist policy. Taiwan has no diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's leaders averted a civil war last
month and the country now faces prospects of less communism and more
democracy accompanied by painful economic adjustment, the president
of Slovenia, one of the nation's six republics, said Wednesday.
   ``Two weeks ago, you would have asked, `when does the civil war
come?'' but the crisis was defused by decisions taken in late
October by the national communist party's central committee, the
national assembly and others, said Janez Stanovnik.
   Stanovnik described recent developments to a National Press Club
gathering and later at a meeting with Secretary of State George
Shultz, a longtime acquaintance. He is on an unofficial visit to see
his son in Philadelphia and attend Friday's board meeting of the
International Management Institute in New York.
   Stanovik said demonstrations fueled by inflation and Serbian
nationalism were threatening decentralized Yugoslavia with civil war.
   The prospect of ethnic disturbances in the Republic of Bosnia, a
fragile community of Moslems, Christians and members of the Orthodox
faith prompted him and leaders of other republics to act through the
federal party on matters normally reserved to regional authorities,
he said.
   Stanovnik, a longtime leader of the ruling Yugoslav Communist
League and a contemporary of the late Marshall Josip Broz Tito, the
founder of modern Yugoslavia, said he realized that ``If this thing
will come to Bosnia and Bosnia disintegrated there will be
bloodshed. It was this that made me profoundly afraid we are truly
on the edge of civil war.''
   Stanovnik said he joined leaders of Montenegro and others at the
central committee to tell the Serbians ``please don't cross this
line ... which I thought we should in all friendship say to our
brothers.''
   The result was a non-confidence vote against Serbian politburo
member Dusan Ckrebic, widely regarded as a rebuff ``from the whole
of Yugoslavia'' to Serbian Communist Party chief Slobodan Milosevic
over fanning ethnic tensions, Stanovnik said.
   With this action, ``I think the whole situation in Yugoslavia has
changed and we have thus made a crucial start'' toward reform, he
said.
   Stanovnik said his differences with Milosevic were in political
strategy while in economic reform, ``Comrade Milosevic is as liberal
as I am.''
   Constitutional amendments subsequently approved by the national
assembly ``actually mean de-ideologizing the Yugoslav economy,''
with such changes as freeing private enterprise and business to
operate in a free market, said Stanovnik.
   The transformation carries essential political conditions, he
said, including human rights, free press, free expression, free
thought and, eventually, direct elections.
   Stanovnik said the Communist party, whose members make up only 10
percent of the population, ``must step down from directly
interfering in government affairs and must become rather a party of
movement and not of direct government.''
   This idea ``was by and large endorsed by the Yugoslav party,'' at
the recent central committee session, ``maybe not as a
enthusiastically as in Slovenia,'' but enough to warrant moderate
optimism for the future, he said.
   Stanovnik said the Slovenians also won adoption of their proposal
for reduced military spending on the premise that East-West detente
has revived. He gave no figures.
   Yugoslavia will have to cut social services and ``it will be very
painful,'' he said, because the country has been providing ``a
socialist heaven'' of good schools, hospitals and pensions without
producing enough to pay for them.

<HEAD>Journalists in One-Day Strike Over IRA Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television journalists at the British Broadcasting
Corp. voted Wednesday to join a one-day strike protesting a
government ban on broadcasting interviews with members of the Irish
Republican Army.
   The Nov. 10 stoppage by the National Union of Journalists'
250-member branch at BBC Television Center could black out hourly
news bulletins and current affairs programs.
   The union, which called for the strike, said journalists at the
BBC World Service, the worldwide radio network, also will strike and
that BBC locals across Britain have voted overwhelmingly in favor of
protests ranging from partial stoppages to a full 24-hour walkout.
   Independent Television News, which is part of Britain's
commercial Independent Television network, will vote later in the
week on whether to strike. The 150-member ITN union local voted
unanimously against a strike at a meeting last week, the union said.
   ``The public should realise this has nothing to do with a defence
of terrorism,'' said John Foster, organizer for the estimated 4,000
television and radio journalists in the union. ``It is opposition to
a government attempt to censor broadcasting.''
   Broadcast journalists in Northern Ireland would not be asked to
strike because many of them feared the strike could be seen as
supporting terrorism, Foster said.
   On Oct. 20, the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
imposed an immediate ban on broadcast interviews with members of the
outlawed IRA and 10 other militant groups in Northern Ireland, and
their sympathizers.
   The ban was imposed under laws governing the two radio and TV
networks, the publicly financed BBC and the commercially funded
Independent Television.
   It followed an upsurge in killings by the mainly Roman Catholic
IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Catholic Irish
Republic under socialist rule.
   Radio and television can still report in indirect speech the
views of members of the affected organizations and their supporters.

<HEAD>Pentagon Joins Battle To Replace Ozone-Damaging Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department, considered one of the
biggest U.S. offenders in its reliance on a chemical that depletes
the Earth's ozone layer, formally joined a government-industry task
force on Wednesday with a pledge to help find alternatives.
   The department, in a brief statement, said it would support a
three-step program aimed at finding and testing alternatives to
chlorofluorocarbon compounds or CFCs by April 1989.
   The task force is being led by the Environmental Protection
Agency but includes representatives of the major companies that
produce CFCs, electronics producers who rely heavily on the chemical
and various military agencies.
   One of the biggest uses of CFC compounds is as a solvent for
cleaning electronic components, circuit boards and materials that
are to be welded together. The compound also is used to clean metal
parts in a variety of weapon systems.
   ``In the United States in 1986, 150 million pounds of CFC-113
were used for prepping printed wire assemblies, metal cleaning and
precision cleaning,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``The armed forces and companies supplying equipment to them
accounted for nearly half of that, according to some estimates.''
   The Pentagon said the task force first would quantify the Defense
Department's cleanliness standards, then set up procedures for
testing and evaluating the effectiveness of alternative chemicals.
   Those first two phases ``will be completed early next year,'' the
Pentagon continued.
   The third and final phase will be the actual testing of
alternatives, ``and current plans are to complete testing of
alternative materials by April 1989,'' the statement said.
   The task force includes at least 23 corporations, including such
CFC producers as Du Pont and Allied-Signal; electronics' makers such
as the Digital Equipment Corp., AT&T and Magnavox, and such huge
defense contractors as General Dynamics, Honeywell, Hughes Aircraft,
IBM, Texas Instruments and Litton Industries, the Pentagon said.
   ``This program is a result of the Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer, which was signed by the United States in
Montreal, Canada, last year,'' the Pentagon concluded.
   That protocol, or international treaty, contains a pledge by the
world's major producing nations to reduce by 50 percent their output
of CFCs by 1998.
   The ozone layer reduces the amount of cancer-causing ultraviolet
rays from the sun that reach the Earth's surface. The CFC compounds,
normally inert, rise through the atmosphere to the ozone layer,
where those same ultraviolet rays break them apart and free
ozone-destroying chlorine.
   According to scientific studies, the long-lived CFC compounds
have since about 1960 destroyed 2.5 percent of the ozone layer. The
EPA estimates that every percent decrease in ozone results in 43,000
additional skin cancer cases in the United States. Currently there
are about 500,000 cases a year.
   Besides their use as cleaning solvents, CFCs are used as
refrigeration fluids and plastic foam blowing agents. Many countries
still permit their use as aerosol propellants, a use banned in the
United States in 1978.

<HEAD>Preliminary Results Suggest High AIDS Virus Infection On Campuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preliminary results of a study of 20 U.S. colleges
suggest about three out of every thousand college students is
infected with the AIDS virus, according to federal health officials
who caution that final numbers may be either higher or lower.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, along with the American
College Health Association, is testing 1,000 anonymous blood samples
from each of 20 U.S. colleges as part of a family of surveys to
assess the prevalence of the AIDS virus in the U.S. population, CDC
spokeswoman Anne Simms said Wednesday.
   ``The survey is not expected to be completed until February
1989,'' she said. ``Until February, we really don't have any kind of
meaningful estimate of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection
on college campuses.''
   About 5,000 of those samples have been tested, she said, showing
a rate of about three cases per 1,000 college students, or 0.3
percent. She said she did not know where the 5,000 samples came
from, whether they were from all 20 colleges in the study or just
some of them.
   ``This number was not unexpected,'' Ms. Simms said. ``We knew
that there was HIV infection among this population. This just
confirms what we already knew, and in fact the final results in
February may be higher or lower, we don't have any real way of
knowing.''
   By comparison, other studies indicate infection rates of four out
of 1,000 prisoners, or 0.4 percent.
   Nationwide, researchers believe the infection rate is between 0.4
percent and 0.6 percent, or perhaps 1.5 million people. The
government has estimated that 20 percent to 30 percent of those
infected with the AIDS virus will develop AIDS within five years,
although there are differing theories on this.
   CDC reported last week that 76,670 cases have been reported since
June 1981, with 43,027 fatalities.
   Some medical experts worry that most, if not virtually all, of
those infected with the virus will eventually become sick and die
because of evidence that the disease has a long incubation period.
   ``The only thing we can show from these preliminary results is
that there is HIV infection on college campuses. College students
are not immune from AIDS,'' Ms. Simms said.
   The preliminary results come on the heels of letter in September
from Assistant U.S. Secretary for Health Dr. Robert E. Windom to
university presidents and deans focusing on the danger to students.
   Windom said that one-fifth of the reported AIDS cases currently
occur among people 20 to 29 years old.
   ``Since the average incubation period (for AIDS) ... is seven
years or longer, it's clear that many of the 14,000 patients in this
group were high school or college age at the time of their
infection,'' Windom said in the letter.
   Ms. Simms said the preliminary results reinforce health
officials' advice that people engaging in high-risk behavior should
change their ways.
   AIDS is carried in blood and other bodily fluids and is most
commonly transmitted by sexual contact or by shared, contaminated
drug needles. Eighty-seven percent of all reported cases in the
United States have occurred among homosexual or bisexual males or
intravenous drug abusers.

<TEXT>
   Advanced Soviet fighter-bombers
recently brought into southern Afghanistan have been used this week
to attack guerrilla positions around Kandahar, the country's
second-largest city.
   Waves of MiG-27s could be seen operating south of the city
Monday, and guerrillas reported heavy bombing earlier at their
positions several miles east of the airport.
   Guerrilla leaders and the U.S. State Department said last week
that MiG-27s had been seen in Afghanistan, and Washington warned the
Soviets about escalating the war.
   The State Department also said Tuesday that Scud missiles capable
of reaching Pakistan, 120 miles away, had appeared in Kabul,
Afghanistan's capital.
   Kabul radio said the missiles were to be used late Tuesday but
did not say where.
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said Afghan government
forces fired a ``powerful missile'' at a guerrilla base near the
Pakistan border. Maj. Gen. M.Z. Sulemal was quoted as saying the
target was a store of anti-aircraft missiles, ground-to-ground
missiles, mines and shells near Marulgad in Nangarhar province.
   A spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday: ``The
introduction of SS-1 Scud missiles in Afghanistan is a serious
violation of the Geneva accords (and) represents a new and grave
threat to peace and security of the region.''
   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in Geneva, the
Soviet Union is to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by Feb.
5, 1989.
   Moslem insurgents began fighting in Afghanistan after a Communist
coup in April 1978 and the Red Army entered the country in December
1979. An estimated 115,000 Soviet military personnel were in
Afghanistan the Geneva agreement was signed.
   Half the Soviet soldiers are gone, but U.N. observers assigned to
monitor the agreement said the latest developments cast doubt on
Moscow's commitment to complete the withdrawal.
   Officials in Kabul call the Scud missiles the latest addition to
their arsenal, but guerrillas previously have described long-range
missiles resembling Scuds.
   Soviet-made Frog missiles with a shorter range of 30 miles were
reported in Barikot, a northeastern garrison town after guerrillas
captured it last summer.
   Fighting at Kandahar has been heaviest around the airport, about
12 miles from downtown. Guerrillas said the first MiG-27 attacks
occurred Oct. 24-27 on their positions east of the airport near Tor
Kotan village.
   A guerrilla source in Quetta, Pakistan, said the aircraft were
first spotted about Oct. 19 at a Soviet-Afghan air base at Shindand
in western Afghanistan.
   Insurgents in the area also reported seeing new helicopter
gunships that were smaller, faster and more maneuverable than
earlier models but could not identify the type, the source said.
   Those gunships covered roads connecting Kandahar to Kabul and
Herat during the last week in October, said Ismail Galaini of the
National Islamic Front of Afghanistan guerrilla group.

<HEAD>Chief Censor Says `Cult of Secrecy' Is Passing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's chief censor told Izvestia
Wednesday that the time of the ``cult of secrecy'' has passed, but
that his agency won't be disappearing from the lives of Soviet
journalists.
   The article in the government newspaper was Vladimir Boldirev's
first published interview.
   Boldirev, head of the Chief Directorate for the Protection of
Government Secrets in the Press, or Glavlit, said his country still
has secrets and any thought that his agency is no longer needed is
just ``a wish, not reality.''
   He said, however, that restrictions on the press have eased
considerably and that the list of banned topics has shrunk by a
third, Izvestia reported.
   Boldirev said that about 7,500 previously banned Soviet books
have been restored to library shelves, and most foreign publications
will soon join them.
   Glavlit still holds onto 400 Soviet books it considers
pornographic or likely to incite ethnic strife and these remain in
``special repositories,'' he said.
   The Soviet press now is allowed to report on many topics
previously banned, including major accidents, crime, and ecological
and medical problems, Boldirev noted. The media still are limited
when censors consider a report to contain state secrets or to be
prejudicial to Soviet interests.
   Also quick to earn the censor's denial are articles incompatible
with public morality and protection of health, and any that seem to
preach undermining or liquidating the socialist system, Boldirev
said.
   Censorship continues in other ways. Last week, authorities seized
typewriters, papers and other working materials of an unofficial
Leningrad weekly called Democratic Opposition, said Nikolai
Khamarov, an activist in Moscow.

<HEAD>Syringe Vending Machine Tested In Effort To Halt Spread of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Municipal health officials are
testing a vending machine that would provide drug users with clean
syringes at any time, in an effort to halt the spread of AIDS, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Ernst Buning, spokesman for Amsterdam's Municipal Health
Department, said the city budgeted $17,500 for the vending machine
project, which would make clean syringes available at night for the
first time.
   Buning said a syringe exchange program for drug users has been
under way in Amsterdam since 1984, but drug counseling offices that
distribute the syringes are open only during the day. ``Nights
remain a problem,'' he said.
   If technical problems with the current prototype are resolved,
Buning said, a test model would be placed at one Amsterdam location
and the city would consult with residents to ensure it was being
used only by those who need it.
   He admitted it was a ``realistic concern'' that neighborhood
children might buy a syringe from the machine to play with, but
claimed it would not influence them to become drug abusers.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a virus that
attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
many infections and cancers. No cure has been found.
   The virus is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include by transfusion of tainted blood or
blood products, and sharing contaminated hypodermic needles or
syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.
   The 5-foot-high machine issues a sterile hypodermic syringe if a
used one is inserted into a specially designed slot, Buning said.
The machine can tell whether it is really a syringe that is being
inserted, he said.
   Drug users can also buy a syringe from the machine by inserting
50 cents.
   Buning claimed that only 27 percent of the Dutch capital's 7,000
drug addicts have been infected with the AIDS virus because of the
syringe exchange program, as opposed to 60-70 percent in cities like
New York, Paris or Milan.
   However, he conceded that as many as 5,500 Amsterdam heroin
abusers do not inject the drug but inhale it instead.
   ``At least we're trying to do something (about AIDS), but whether
it really helps in the long run we don't know,'' Buning said.
   Police in Amsterdam and the port city of Rotterdam routinely
confiscate used syringes from drug abusers they arrest and issue the
addicts clean ones when they are released.
   Of the 605 Dutch AIDS patients, about half have died, according
to figures released Oct 1.
   The Amsterdam program is mainly geared to removing used syringes
from circulation. It has not led to any increase in drug abuse,
according to Buning.

   ``We need to support all of these elements that go with the rule

letting people see they will be extradited to the place where they
committed a crime. We have to stand by these things.''

<HEAD>Latest PTL Bidder Would Bring Back Bakker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest bidder for PTL says it's
``absolutely necessary'' to return deposed evangelist Jim Bakker to
head the bankrupt ministry.
   Bakker responded Wednesday that he was ``thrilled at the
thought.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds is scheduled to choose a
buyer for PTL's assets Nov. 16 from four bids ranging from $113
million to $120 million for the Heritage USA complex, its 2,200
acres and the PTL television network.
   A group of ministers and businessmen calling themselves ``Lexalt
University'' offered $116 million for PTL last week. A spokesman for
the group said Tuesday that they want Bakker at the helm at Heritage
USA.
   Of the three previous bidders, one was recommended to Reynolds by
PTL Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton. In October, he recommended the
judge accept the $115 million offer from Stephen Mernick of Toronto.
After that, another Canadian, Vancouver's Peter Thomas of Samoth
Capital Corp., resubmitted a bid of $113 million directly to the
court.
   A bid of $120 million by a Christian business association called
``Holy Celebration'' was made Oct. 26. Its two trustees are Herbert
T. Nelson, a lawyer of Greenbelt, Md., and Sandi Kalez of Seattle.
   ``It's absolutely necessary,'' to give the ministry back to
Bakker, said the Rev. Edward J. Brown of Atlanta, who was acting for
``Lexalt University.''
   ``If Jim Bakker is not at the helm in the future, sooner or
later, Heritage USA would fall apart,'' Brown said Tuesday.
   ``I am thrilled at the thought of returning to television with
the people we love,'' Bakker said Wednesday. ``We're looking forward
to returning Heritage USA to the partners and lifetime members who
built it.''
   Brown offered $116 million in his bid in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Columbia. But ``Lexalt University does not really exist,'' said
Brown, an interdenominational minister and financial consultant.
   He said Lexalt University and The Covenant Group are names for
the ``facilitators,'' the financial backers who will ``bring the
funds.''
   Lexalt backers are ``ministers who are teachers. There will be an
opportunity to teach'' at Heritage USA if it's sold to Lexalt, he
said.
   The Covenant Group describes itself as ``Christian businessmen
and associates of men all over the country, in and out of the United
States.''
   Brown said he has been a minister 17 years, but has been in a
traveling ministry since he resigned from his congregation in
Redding, Calif., in 1984. He had been an Assemblies of God minister,
he said.
   Bakker left the ministry amid a sex and money scandal in March
1987. Three months later, PTL filed for protection from its
creditors in bankruptcy court.

   The Soviet Union turned over to the
Organization of American States on Wednesday a document pledging
Soviet respect for the neutrality of the Panama Canal when the
waterway comes under Panamanian control at the end of the century.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, speaking in Spanish, said the
pledge applies ``both to peacetime and to wartime as well.''
   A protocol attached to the Panama Canal treaties is designed to
ensure the neutrality of the canal, and 36 nations have promised to
abide by that provision.
   OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares said the Soviet step was
a ``clear demonstration'' of Soviet willingness to contribute to the
rule of law.
   Panamanian OAS delegate Soraya Cano noted that U.S.-Panamanian
relations have been tense for some time but that her government
believes that issues related to the canal should not be affected.
   William Price, a member of the U.S. delegation to the OAS, said
that in the next 11 years, the United States will continue working
with Panama to carry out the terms of the treaties.

<TEXT>
   Merck & Co. announced Wednesday it is donating
a new drug for the treatment of river blindness in 11 African
countries and will provide the drug ``as long as it takes to
eradicate this disease.''
   Art Kaufman, a Merck company spokesman, said an independent
committee of experts has approved a treatment program using the
drug, called Mectizan, and treatment of at least 250,000 people in
West Africa will start next year.
   A program for mass treatment in the 11 countries was developed by
the Onchocerciasis Control Program, an organization in West Africa.
The committee of experts, organized at the request of Merck,
examined the plan and approved it this week, Kaufman said.
   Other countries may receive the drug later if treatment programs
are approved by the committee of experts, he said.
   ``We plan to donate this drug as long as it is needed, as long as
it takes to eradicate this disease,'' said Kaufman.
   Kaufman said Merck had spent millions to develop the drug, but he
could not provide a figure for how much the drug distribution will
cost the company.
   River blindness, the informal name for onchocerciasis, is endemic
in 35 countries and affects an estimated 18 million people.
   The disease is caused by a parasitic worm that is spread to
victims through the bite of the blackfly. The blackfly thrives along
the banks of fast-moving rivers, hence the disease is informally
called river blindness.
   Typically, the disease is spread when a fly bites a person
infected with river blindness and picks up microfilariae, the
immature form of the parasitic worm. The parasite matures to an
infective larvae inside the fly and is introduced into a new human
victim when the fly bites again.
   Inside the human victim, the larvae matures to an adult worm,
sometimes growing to well over two feet in length, and produces
millions of microfilariae, which restart the cycle when a black fly
bites.
   Infected humans suffer from itching, weight loss, the growth of
nodules and a variety of lesions that eventually can cause blindness.
   World Health Organization officials estimate that about 340,000
have been blinded by the disease and that there are about 85 million
people in 35 developing countries who are at risk. The disease
occurs in large parts of West Africa, the Middle East and in Central
and South America.
   The 11 countries that will receive the initial shipment of the
Merck drug are Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau,
Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. All are in
West Africa.
   Protection from river blindness requires an annual treatment with
the drug. The drug works by killing the microfilariae and preventing
the adult worm from secreting more, thus preventing the major
symptoms of the disease and its transmission to other humans.

   Police on Wednesday used tear gas and
batons to disperse thousands of rioting young people who shouted
``No sugar, no bread!'' and ``Down with the dictators,'' witnesses
said.
   It was the fifth straight day of protests against high food
prices and the government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi. Officials
reported several arrests but no casualties.
   Khartoum Commissioner Fatih Abdoun told the protesters the
government would do its best to ease shortages of bread and sugar.
   Moslem fundamentalists and university students joined the
demonstrations, which ended by mid-afternoon. Many protesters had to
walk home under a burning sun because the disturbances shut down
public bus service.
   The city center was almost deserted, except for riot police who
continued to patrol streets littered with ashes from burned tires.
   High school students began protesting last Saturday, throwing
stones and burning tires in the streets of Khartoum and Omdurman,
the capital's twin city across the Nile River.
   On Tuesday, riot police fired into the air to disperse youths who
attacked several government installations, including Khartoum's main
local government building and the Cabinet offices.
   The newspaper Al-Sudani reported that shots also were fired
Tuesday to disperse stone-throwers at the U.S. Embassy. Riot police
on Wednesday sealed off roads leading to the embassy and various
government ministries.
   Schools and universities have not been closed officially, but
many were shuttered out of fear that demonstrators would attack
students who were not participating.
   In 1985, 10 days of riots against high food prices led to a
general strike that ended the 16-year dictatorship of former
President Gaafar Nimeiri. Those protests were led by professionals
and unionists, however, and the current disturbances appear to have
involved only young people.
   Mahdi was elected prime minister in 1986. His government faces
severe economic problems, including an $11-billion foreign debt and
70 percent inflation.

<HEAD>U.N. Reports Executions in Iran After Cease-fire</HEAD>

   A U.N. report on human rights in Iran says
``a renewed wave of executions'' began about the time the
fundamentalist Islamic government accepted a cease-fire in its
8-year-old war with Iraq.
   An advance copy of the report to the General Assembly was
obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press. It calls for continued
scrutiny of Iran's human rights practices, citing executions of
political dissidents and other reports of abuses.
   The first secretary of Iran's U.N. Mission, Amir Hossein
Zamaninia, said the mission had seen the report and had no comment.
   U.N. special representative Reynaldo Galindo Pohl said in his
report ``a large number of prisoners, members of opposition groups,
were executed during the months of July, August and early September
1988.''
   Most were members of the People's Mujahedeen, an outlawed
opposition group, but the report said about 20 belonged to such
other opposition groups as the Tudeh party, a Marxist organization,
and the People's Fedayeen.
   It did not say how many people had been put to death, but
mentioned groups of executions cited in Iranian and other media from
July through September that included 1,140 political executions and
others for common crimes.
   Iran accepted the cease-fire July 18 and it took effect Aug. 20.
Five days later, it began U.N.-mediated peace talks with Iraq.
   The Washington office of the People's Mujahedeen said there has
been ``a dramatic rise in political arrests, torture and executions
in Iran'' since September.
   ``Specifically, in the last three months alone, more than 10,000
persons have been arrested and thousands executed on the charge of
opposition'' to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime, said a
statement by spokesman Aladdin Touran distributed at U.N.
headquarters.
   The U.N. report notes that the executions followed a July 25-28
raid into Iran by National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the
People's Mujahedeen.
   It said persecution of Bahai worshipers appears to have
decreased, although Iran's attitude toward members of the faith has
not changed. Bahais are denied the right to practice their faith in
Iran, and cannot obtain higher education or work for the government.
   ``By July 1988, a number of Bahais including some prominent
members of the Bahai community who had been arrested, allegedly
because of their faith, were released from prison and some prison
sentences were reduced,'' the report said.
   Galindo Pohl interviewed seven Bahais and nine sympathizers of
the People's Mujahedeen who formerly lived in Iran in addition to
obtaining written accounts and information from Iranian media, his
report said.
   The report noted Iran's contention that Islamic law may not match
every tenet of international law and its disagreement with the
principle that ``adherence to international law is a must for every
state.''

<HEAD>Whooping Cough Claims Amish Infant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An outbreak of whooping cough among rural
Amish who refuse vaccinations against the disease has claimed one
infant and may threaten the lives of several other children, health
officials said Wednesday.
   The death of a four-month-old boy Monday in the Cattaraugus
County town of Conewango is the first U.S. whooping cough fatality
in three years, federal health officials said.
   Six other Amish children have been diagnosed with the disease,
according to Dr. James Wild, director of the Conewango Valley
Medical Center.
   The same community was hit by 216 cases of the disease in 1982
and six cases were reported in 1985, officials said. There were no
deaths from the previous outbreaks.
   Conewango is about 45 miles south of Buffalo and is home to about
1,200 Amish, members of a strict Mennonite sect that shuns modern
conveniences.
   ``The Amish are a very closed society and they resist modern
ways. Most of them just don't believe in immunizations, they don't
think they are necessary,'' said Patricia Kota, a registered nurse
and assistant administrator of Tri-County Hospital in Gowanda.
   Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a respiratory disease that
causes a chronic cough, vomiting and a characteristic ``whoop'' when
the victim gasps for air.
   Among adults and older children it can seem to be little more
than a cold, but it can be fatal for infants and small children,
according to officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, Ga.
   The country's most recent whooping cough outbreak affected about
100 children last year in an Amish settlement in Delaware, said
Kenneth Allman, spokesman for the disease control agency.
   Most children are protected against whooping cough by the ``DPT''
series of immunizations, but most Amish children do not get
immunized, officials said.
   Immunization is required of all public school children in New
York unless there are extenuating religious or health reasons.
   ``Once the disease gets a foothold in this type of community it
can take off quickly,'' said William Fagel, a spokesman for the
state Health Department.

   The Supreme Court denied a stay of execution
Wednesday for a Texas man convicted in the 1975 slaying of a nurse,
clearing the way for his death by injection early Thursday, a court
spokeswoman said.
   Donald Gene Franklin's application was referred to the full court
by Justice Byron R. White, and the court decided 7-2 to deny the
application, said spokeswoman Toni House. Justices Thurgood Marshall
and William J. Brennan Jr. issued their standard dissent, she said.
   Franklin, who was once described by his own attorney as the most
hated man in San Antonio, was convicted in the July 1975 death of
Mary Margaret ``Peggy'' Moran.
   Ms. Moran disappeared from a San Antonio hospital and was found
five days later, barely alive, in a vacant lot. Nude and bleeding
from multiple stab wounds, she died later in a hospital.
   Franklin, who was on parole for a rape conviction when he was
arrested, consistently denied any involvement in Ms. Moran's death
and blamed it on a friend.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
went national Wednesday with two TV commercials from California that
play on anxieties about foreign interests buying up America.
   ``I want an America that's in charge of its own future ... not a
country that is selling off its land and its assets piece by piece
to foreign interests,'' Dukakis says in the opening to both
30-second ads.
   In one spot he says, ``I want an America that exports its
products, not its jobs.'' In the other, he vows that ``We're going
to have clean air, and clean water, and clean coasts and a clean
government in Washington, D.C.''
   The two commercials were taped last week at a spirited rally at
the Scottish Rite Temple in Los Angeles. Both end with the tag line,
``Mike Dukakis: On Your Side.''
   The two are among a series of new Dukakis ads in the final week
before the Nov. 8 election, among them an upbeat musical commercial
and a Texas spot featuring Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' vice
presidential running mate.
   The Texas ad, taped at a rally in Nederland, shows Bentsen
accusing Republicans of ``trying to scare you with some phony
issues. They don't want to talk about real issues because they've
turned their backs on Texans.''
   An announcer says Texas lost 250,000 jobs, 200 banks and 23,000
businesses ``with George Bush in Washington.'' Bentsen concludes by
asking his fellow Texans to go Democratic in next Tuesday's
balloting.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, said two new Bush ads would
start Friday. Atwater said the new spots are positive and feature
the vice president explaining to viewers why he's running for
president.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., head of the Dukakis
campaign's Hispanic vote drive, complained of ``Republican scare
tactics'' in the Rio Grande Valley.
   Richardson cited a Spanish-language radio ad containing a warning
to voters.
   ``Voting officials will be watching closely,'' the announcer
says. ``It is illegal to vote in this election if you are not a U.S.
citizen. If you have a green card, you cannot vote. If you do vote,
you can be subject to up to 10 years in prison, fined up to $5,000
and lose your opportunity to become a U.S. citizen. If you accept
money to vote, you may be subject to five years in jail. Remember,
election officials are watching.''
   Richardson said the ad is intended to ``chase Hispanics away from
the electoral process. ... I don't see these ads being aired in
English and directed to the Republicans' core constituencies.''
   Kathryn Murray, communications director for the Republican
National Committee, said the ad ``apparently is being run by some
county party down there. It's not anything that's authorized by the
RNC. I think it's crazy and I can't understand why they would
possibly be doing it.''

   Cambodian resistance leader Son Sann urged
the General Assembly on Wednesday to keep up pressure on Vietnam and
for the 10th consecutive year to vote for a Vietnamese troop
withdrawal from Cambodia.
   ``We are more than ever close to a settlement,'' Son Sann said.
``We need your support more than ever ... to maintain the necessary
pressure to obtain the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cambodia.''
   He asked for a fixed timetable for withdrawal.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978. Every year since then,
the 159-nation General Assembly has overwhelmingly condemned the
occupation and called for Hanoi to withdraw its troops, now
estimated at 130,000.
   Among signs of movement in resolving the Cambodian conflict is a
dialogue now under way among Cambodian factions and between China
and the Soviet Union.
   Son Sann is prime minister of the three-party coalition
government-in-exile of Democratic Kampuchea, or Cambodia, which is
recognized by the United Nations.
   The resistance coalition's forces fighting the Vietnamese include
Son Sann's faction; the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk; and the
communist Khmer Rouge, the largest and strongest force, armed by
China.
   Communist Vietnam ousted the Khmer Rouge regime and replaced it
with a pro-Hanoi government, which the U.N. refuses to accept.
   One complaint expressed by Vietnam's ambassador to the U.N.,
Trinh Xuan Lang, in rejecting this year's resolution on troop
withdrawal was that it does not emphasize the importance of
excluding Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and his associates from any
future government in Cambodia.
   About 1 million Cambodians were killed by executions, famine and
civil unrest under the Khmer Rouge from 1975-78 until the Vietnamese
invaders routed the Pol Pot regime.
   The vote last year was 117 to 21. The resolution was expected to
gain at least one vote this year, despite Soviet and Vietnamese
lobbying in favor of a milder draft resolution which would not call
for withdrawal.
   Son Sann appealed to Moscow Wednesday, saying: ``The cessation of
Soviet aid to Vietnam would contribute greatly to withdrawal of
occupying forces from Cambodia.''
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov struck a conciliatory
note in his address, emphasizing the importance of ongoing dialogue
among Cambodian factions and countries in Southeast Asia.
   He said, however, that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops must
be linked to excluding Pol Pot and his associates, a sentiment that
has been echoed by several nations.
   But Chinese Ambassador Li Luye, whose government is the main
backer and arms supplier of the Khmer Rouge, maintained a hard line,
insisting on the total and unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops as the first step in a comprehensive political settlement.
   Li signaled, however, that China tempers its political support of
the Khmer Rouge with realism by emphasizing that no single faction
should dominate in a provisional government and no faction should be
excluded.
   Son Sann said that after Vietnamese troop withdrawal, a new,
provisional government must be formed in Phnom Penh from the three
rebel factions and Cambodians in the Vietnamese-backed government
that would be dissolved. No faction would dominate and no one would
be eliminated, he said.
   An international commission would oversee that phase as well as
holding free and fair elections to choose a new government of a
neutral and non-aligned Cambodia.
   Asked about his uneasy alliance with the Khmer Rouge, Son Sann
told reporters: ``We are in a coalition with a precise goal, to free
our country from the Vietnamese occupation.''
   The Cambodia resolution this year calls for the ``non-return of
the universally condemned policies and practices of the recent
past.''
   Son Sann said that phrase refers to the Vietnamese, although it
is widely taken to refer as well to the Khmer Rouge.

<HEAD>Administration Enjoined From Changing Public Housing Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Wednesday was
enjoined temporarily from restricting grievance procedures that
advocates contend protect the rights of 3.4 million Americans living
in public housing.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt issued a temporary restraining
order that bars the Department of Housing and Urban Development from
implementing new regulations that had been set to take effect on
Monday.
   Pratt, who scheduled further proceedings on Nov. 22, said
tenants' organizations that sued HUD had raised ``some valid
complaints'' about the elimination of many longstanding grievance
procedures for tenants to contest eviction or complain about
substandard living conditions.
   ``Tenants would be stripped of their rights'' to grievance
proceedings to contest evictions or to force local housing
authorities to provide heat and make repairs, said Florence Roisman,
a staff attorney for the National Housing Law Project.
   Ms. Roisman argued that HUD was flouting the intent of Congress
by effectively repealing longstanding regulations that had been
pieced together by legislation and a series of court decisions.
   According to the plaintiffs' complaint, only people whose
signatures appear on public housing leases would have a right to a
grievance hearing under the new regulation.
   The new regulations also would eliminate pre-eviction hearings
before local housing authorities. Such hearings would take place in
state courts. The regulations also would narrow the category of
issues that can be raised in grievance proceedings.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William J. Dempster said HUD was trying
to ``take long overdue action to deregulate what has been a
ponderous and Byzantine centralized regulatory process.''
   ``The current regulations ... have straitjacketed public housing
authorities and rendered them virtually unable to deal with the
problems they are facing,'' Dempster said.
   The regulations would only be interim because Congress passed
legislation, expected to be signed into law by President Reagan,
that requires the department to continue to review them.
   The judge expressed some sympathy for HUD's position, saying:
``The public housing program has not been a smashing success. It has
been inordinately expensive.''
   ``Some of the regulations make a lot of sense to me,'' said
Pratt, noting he once chaired a public housing authority in suburban
Montgomery County, Md. ``On the other hand, I think she's (Ms.
Roisman) got some valid complaints,'' the judge told Dempster.
   ``Some of the regulations make a lot of sense to me,'' Pratt told
Dempster. ``On the other hand, I think she's (Ms. Roisman) got some
valid complaints.''
   Ms. Roisman pointed to a congressional report that said
``Congress is seriously concerned that the recent regulations would
weaken principles of fairness and due process that have been
painstakingly developed over 20 years as a result of legislative and
judicial actions.''
   The report from a House-Senate conference committee said it was
``particularly dismayed'' that HUD had ignored instructions in
legislation to redraft the regulations to conform with a 1985 court
decision. That ruling found that Congress intended to require
grievance proceedings when a public housing agency refuses to make
repairs or provide decent conditions.
   ``We think the regulation that we published does precisely what
Congress intended,'' HUD attorney Steven Baylis said.
   Baylis said in a telephone interview that HUD intended to make it
easier to evict tenants who commit crimes.
   ``If somebody in the family mugs another tenant it makes good
common sense there should be a way to evict the family.''
   Ms. Roisman contended that current regulations give authorities
enough power to evict criminals without denying tenants due process.

Measure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Wednesday joined a group
opposing the official English initiative on the Florida ballot,
arguing that petitions for the measure violated federal voting
rights law.
   Last week U.S. District James W. Kehoe threw out a suit seeking
to stop the initiative, but a special panel of federal judges is to
consider an appeal of his decision at a hearing Thursday.
   The Justice Department's legal brief supports the effort to stop
Amendment 11, which would make English the state's official language.
   ``We think it's fantastic _ maybe the best news I've heard in the
campaign,'' said Jon Weber, executive director of Speak Up Now,
which filed suit against the initiative on behalf of four
Spanish-speaking residents.
   ``It shows we were right on the law,'' he said. ``The Justice
Department does not get involved in suits of this nature and lose. ''
   Opponents have argued that petitions for the initiative should
have been circulated in Spanish as well as English in six heavily
Hispanic Florida counties.
   Florida English, the group that collected more than 500,000
signatures to put the initiative on Tuesday's ballot, successfully
argued before Kehoe that the petitions were private, not public, and
therefore not covered under the federal Voting Rights Act. A federal
appeals court had made a similar ruling in a Colorado case.
   The Justice Department is opposing those rulings in what Weber
says is the first time the federal government has entered the
official English controversy.
   ``They reject the argument that the petition process is
private,'' Weber said. ``They say the state is clearly involved
throughout the petition process, and that the election itself is
merely the culmination of that process.''
   Florida English Chairman Mark LaPorta reacted angrily to news of
the Justice Department's intervention.
   ``I'm offended that they're involved,'' LaPorta said. ``What
they're doing is a last ditch effort based on a glitch, a
technicality.''
   He said it would not change the group's efforts, which the latest
polls show is likely to receive the support of 70 percent of
Florida's voters.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen stumped through the industrial heartland on Wednesday,
shaking hands with blue-collar workers and carrying Michael Dukakis'
message of economic nationalism and middle-class squeeze.
   ``We're on your side in this fight, middle-class America,'' the
Texas senator told a hard-hatted crowd at the LTV cold steel
finishing plant in Massillon.
   The steel industry has been hard hit by foreign competition, and
Bentsen touted his experience in trade when when speaking to the
employees.
   ``What you need is someone who'll stand up for the workers of
America,'' he said. ``Export the products and not the jobs.''
   Bentsen donned a yellow hard hat and toured part of the plant,
near Canton, Ohio, which employees 350 people. After visiting a work
station where steel rods are finished and packaged, he stuck a
``USA'' label on a bundle.
   ``I'll stand American workers against any workers in the world,''
he said. When Bush became vice president, Americans were the highest
paid workers in the world, he said. Now, he said, they trailed
behind the Japanese and West Germans, he said.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said it was time to vote Democratic
because the Republicans weren't doing enough to help industries hurt
by unfair trade.
   ``They've talked like Rambo and they've acted like Bambi,'' he
said.
   Bentsen also continued his attacks on Bush's running mate, Dan
Quayle.
   ``I'd like to have George Bush here and ask him ... did you pick
the very best person?'' he said.
   Arriving in Ohio, Bentsen was greeted at the Akron-Canton airport
by a boisterous crowd of several hundred supporters in a hangar on a
cold, drizzly day.
   From Ohio, Bentsen traveled to Charleston, W.Va., where he
attended a rally with Senate Majoriy Leader Robert C. Byrd and
Senate colleague John D. Rockefeller, along with other West Virginia
elected officials.
   Rep. Bob Wise clogged to get the crowd stirred up, and a band
played ``la Bamba'' and ``Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Lloyd,'' a
variation on a Motown song.
   Bentsen started the day at Southern Illinois University in
Carbondale, where he told supporters that Bush's choice of Quayle
``showed a real disdain, disregard for our country.''
   Several times in his speech, Bentsen called the Republican vice
presidential nominee ``R. Dan Quayle,'' getting wrong the
candidate's first initial, which is J.
   He criticized Quayle for his positions on issues including 60
days' advance notice for plant closings.
   The Democratic vice presidential nominee was introduced by
Illinois' two senators, Democrats Paul Simon and Alan Dixon.
   Simon launched the attack on Quayle, saying that if Republicans
in the U.S. Senate were polled as to whether they preferred Bentsen
or Quayle, Bentsen would win handily. ``It would be a washaway,'' he
said.
   He told the crowd ``Don't believe the polls,'' a message Bentsen
has been delivering in the final push of his campaign as he insists
the Democrats are staging a comback that will put them over the top
on Election Day.
   Tad Devine, a top aide to Dukakis who coordinates Bentsen's
campaign with that of the Massachusetts governor, said there was
evidence in Democratic polling that Quayle was increasing as an
issue, and he said that could be critical in close states such as
Ohio and Illinois.
   Devine said the campaign was seeking maximum television exposure
for Bentsen in the last few days of the campaign to highlight the
differences between him and Quayle.
   ``George Bush said, judge me by how I pick my vice presidential
candidate,'' Bentsen said Wednesday.
   Also Wednesday, a Federal Aviation Administration inspector was
flying in Bentsen's campaign jet. The agency received a letter,
illegibly signed, alleging lax safety procedures on the plane.

   Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York
Philharmonic since 1978, said Wednesday he will leave his post to
pursue ``other artistic endeavors'' when his contract expires in
three seasons.
   Mehta, music director of the Montreal and Los Angeles orchestras
before moving here, said he was turning down a contract extension in
order to free himself of the administrative responsibilities of the
position.
   He announced his decision to the 106-member orchestra Wednesday
morning, after pondering his contract renewal for several months.
   ``The search for a successor will begin shortly,'' said Stephen
Stamas, president of the orchestra corporation. Stamas said in a
statement that he regretted Mehta's decision not to renew.
   As music director, Mehta is responsible for the artistic
administration of the orchestra _ auditioning and hiring players,
selecting works, planning tours and broadcasts and conducting
rehearsals and performances.
   Mehta, 52, said in a statement: ``Having held the position of
music director with various North American orchestras since 1961, I
must at this juncture pursue other artistic endeavors which have to
do with less administrative activity than that with which a music
director is usually involved.''
   Mehta is also music director for life of the Israel Philharmonic.

British-ruled Northern Ireland.
   A review after three years was part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement
when it was signed Nov. 15, 1985, by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain and Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald of Ireland.
   The accord was intended to give Northern Ireland's Roman Catholic
minority more confidence in the administration of the
Protestant-majority province. Catholics say the courts and
employment in the province still are biased against them.
   The review was announced jointly in Belfast Wednesday by Tom
King, Britain's top official in Northern Ireland, and Irish Foreign
Affairs Minister Brian Lenihan.
   A joint communique said the review would be aimed at developing a
positive program for the future of Northern Ireland.
   Progress on combating the outlawed Irish Republican Army's
violent struggle against British rule was discussed at a separate
meeting between law ministers and police chiefs. No details were
disclosed but officials indicated cooperation on both sides of the
border was better than it had been for several years.
   Northern Ireland's Protestant politicians, who bitterly oppose
the 1985 pact, rejected an invitation from King to join talks on the
review. Officials said senior Protestant churchmen and leading
businessmen would likely be invited to meet King.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Hitler Suffered From Parkinson's Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German researcher has
concluded that Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler suffered from Parkinson's
disease during the last years of his life, a leading newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said that Ellen
Gibbels, a neurology and psychiatry professor at the University
Psychiatric Clinic in Cologne, had examined Hitler's medical records
and had studied newsreels of the Nazi leader from the years
1940-1945.
   Hitler's health deteriorated greatly toward the end of his life,
and there has been previous speculation that he suffered from
Parkinson's disease.
   Parkinson's disease is a degenerative illness suffered in later
life. It is often characterized by tremors, muscular rigidity or
loss of balance.
   ``Adolf Hitler suffered in his last years from a definite
Parkinson's syndrome,'' the newspaper said in summarizing her
research.
   Ms. Gibbels based her conclusions on indicators such as
impairment of Hitler's arm movements, a shortening of his strides,
changes in his facial appearance and a trembling of his left hand,
the newspaper reported.
   Hitler committed suicide at the age of 56 on April 30, 1945, in
his bunker in Berlin. In addition to suffering from tremblings and
limb impairments, he also had become increasingly irritable and
suspicious of those around him.
   ``The researcher now wants to examine which effects the
Parkinson's disease may have had on the dictator's mental functions
and therefore also in the political and military decisions,'' the
newspaper said.

<HEAD>Burt Reynolds Shows To Bring Money To Palm Beach County</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUPITER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometimes when a local boy makes good, he
wants his hometown to make out like a bandit, and happily for Palm
Beach County, actor Burt Reynolds is one of those successes.
   Reynolds plans to return to prime-time television in ``B.L.
Stryker,'' a series of six two-hour episodes set in the county. With
each of the episodes budgeted at $4 million, the local economy could
get a hefty infusion.
   Reynolds, a native of the county, plays a Vietnam veteran and
retired New Orleans vice cop who returns to his home in West Palm
Beach. He and Tom Selleck, late of ``Magnum, p.i.,'' are the
executive producers.
   Each of the episodes will be shot on location around the county
in the next six months, Reynolds said Tuesday.
   ``We hope to leave a lot of that (the series' budget) here,'' he
said. ``There are an enormous amount of vehicles that we have to
lease, there's always greenery you have to get, there's furniture
you have to rent. ... The list goes on and on.
   ``Anything that we can get in Palm Beach County, we'll ask here
first before we look somewhere else,'' he said.
   ``This is a very big deal here in Jupiter,'' Mayor Mary Hinton
said. ``We know what a tremendous economic impact it will be. This
show could very easily be one of the largest employers we have in
the town of Jupiter.''
   Not everyone is thrilled at the return of a favorite son.
   The tony resort town of Palm Beach didn't want its police station
used as a primary set, so the Boca Raton station will be used
instead, according to co-producer Alan Barnette of Blue Period
Productions.
   Reynolds' previous efforts to work in the county were rebuffed;
when he sought to film ``The Longest Yard'' at Union Correctional
Institution at Raiford, he was turned down because the film
contained four-letter words, he said. The film about a Florida
convict was shot in Georgia.

<HEAD>Government Won't Join Suit Alleging Northrop Fraud on B-2 Bomber</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department announced Wednesday that
it will stay out of a private suit by four Northrop Corp. employees
alleging the company defrauded the government in the production of
the B-2 Stealth bomber.
   Assistant Attorney General John Bolton, head of the Justice
Department's civil division, said in a statement that after a review
and investigation of the allegations, ``the Department has decided
that there is not a sufficient basis for it to enter the case at
this time.''
   The lawsuit says Northrop's Advance Systems Division falsely
represented to the government that its cost schedule control system
met contractual requirements and that Northrop submitted falsified
reports on cost performance and other matters.
   The suit, which was filed last February in U.S. District Court in
Los Angeles by a current Northrop employee, Terrence Schielke, and
three former Northrop workers, also alleges labor mischarging and
mischarging on sales orders and said the company charged the
government for idle time of its employees.
   Northrop has denied the accusations.
   The Baltimore Sun in a story last week quoted congressional
sources as saying the Justice Department won't take over the lawsuit
because some Air Force personnel overlooked irregularities to keep
development of the classified project moving ahead.
   A Justice Department spokeswoman, Amy Brown, declined to provide
any details on why the government isn't joining the private suit.
   The Justice Department could enter the private suit later on a
showing of good cause.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles is
conducting a criminal investigation of Northrop's work on the
bomber, which is due to be unveiled on Nov. 22.
   The B-2 is to be operational in the early 1990s and Congress has
authorized the purchase of 132 of the bombers, which are built with
materials designed to make the aircraft less visible to enemy radar.
The total estimated cost for the planes is $36.6 billion.

Elsewhere</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heavy snow Wednesday blanketed parts of northeastern New York and
northern Vermont, and showers dampened the northern parts of both
coasts, but it was a pleasant Indian summer day across the nation's
midsection.
   Cold air pulled by a low pressure system brought snow to upstate
New York, with 11 inches recorded at Malone, about 15 miles south of
the Quebec border. In Schoharie County, west of Albany, 5 inches of
snow fell at Broome Center. In Vermont, 8 inches was measured at
Brandon Gap, Jay Peak and near Hancock.
   Rain was scattered over parts of the southern New England and
mid-Atlantic coast as well as over eastern Ohio and western
Pennsylvania.
   A cold front spread rain, accompanied by strong winds, across the
northern Pacific coast. Winds gusted to 60 mph at Astoria, Ore., and
high wind wanings were posted for the southern Washington and
northern Oregon coast, where gusts could reach 70 mph, the National
Weather Service said. Farther inland, rainshowers developed over
parts of Wyoming.
   The center of the nation enjoyed mostly sunny skies with some
high clouds drifting across the Mississippi Valley and western
Texas. Temperatures were in the 70s from Texas and the lower
Mississippi Valley into the central High Plains.
   Afternoon temperatures reached the 60s or 70s across much of the
nation, but it was chillier across the northern tier, with the
mercury in the 30s and 40s from the upper Mississippi Valley through
the Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley into New England. Temperatures
were in the 50s from the Pacific Northwest across the northern
Rockies and from eastern Dakotas into parts of the lower Ohio Valley
and the mid-Atlantic states. Southern Florida, parts of the Rio
Grande Valley and southwestern Arizona basked in 80-degree warmth.
   The low in the nation early Wednesday was 10 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 32
degrees at Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 84 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
   For Thursday, the forecast called for widespread showers across
the northern Pacific coast eastward to the Rockies, and snowshowers
scattered across northern Maine. Highs were predicted in the 60s or
70s across much of the nation, but in the 50s in the Northwest and
from the northern Plains across the Great Lakes and upper Ohio
Valley to southern New England. Central New England was expected to
have temperatures in the 40s, with the mercury only reaching the 30s
in the northern part of the region. Southern Florida, the western
Gulf Coast, much of the southern Plains and southern Plateau and
desert Southwest were expected to have highs in the 80s, and
temperatures in the low 90s were forecast for the Rio Grande Valley
and southwest Arizona.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan derided Michael Dukakis'
``I'm on your side'' appeal to Midwestern voters on Wednesday,
saying Democrats ``are on your side when they want to get their
hands on your wallets.''
   Reagan pushed Vice President George Bush's cause _ and campaigned
on behalf of two GOP Senate candidates _ with fund-raising
appearances in the Cleveland suburb of Berea and in Milwaukee on the
last leg of a week-long, cross-country campaign swing.
   Aides said he will be out again in four more battleground states
in the waning days of the presidential campaign. Reagan will travel
to Chicago and to southern New Jersey on Friday, and make a rare
Saturday trip with stops in Michigan and Dallas.
   The president, obviously buoyed by his vice president's lead in
national polls, told audiences, ``Come next week, the American
public will say no to liberals.''
   ``Come next week, the American public will say no to the
Massachusetts liberal who preaches higher taxes, big spending and a
weak defense,'' Reagan said.
   Speaking to a GOP rally at Baldwin-Wallace College, Reagan
pursued with gusto his bashing of Bush's Democratic opponent,
portraying him as out of touch with mainstream American voters.
   ``You know, the liberals are going around saying they're on your
side. You know better than that,'' Reagan said. ``Our side believes
people who want to protect their home and family from an armed
intruder have a constitutional right to own a gun. The liberals are
against it.''
   ``The truth is, they only come around on your side when they want
to get their hands on your wallets,'' Reagan said. ``I remember the
last time the American people heard that kind of talk, in 1980, the
American people let them know they weren't on your side, they were
on your back.''
   Reagan scoffed at Dukakis' claims to being a Democrat in the
Harry Truman mold, saying, ``I'll tell you one thing, if he's Harry
Truman I'm Roger Rabbit.''
   Without naming him, Reagan took aim at 71-year-old Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who is being challenged by Cleveland Mayor
George Voinovich, a 52-year-old Republican who has won three
landslide mayoral victories in his strongly Democratic city.
   As he had in a previous campaign stop in the state last month,
Reagan said of Metzenbaum, ``He's liberal, liberal, liberal.'' He
said Voinovich had ``saved the city of Cleveland'' from financial
straits.
   Recent polling has shown Metzenbaum well ahead.
   With a morning stop in Milwaukee, Reagan followed in the
footsteps of both Bush and Dukakis, who'd campaigned there Tuesday.
   He told voters to reject ``far-out liberalism'' when they cast
their ballots for president and Congress.
   Speaking at a $150-per-person brunch for Republican senatorial
candidate Susan Engeleiter, the president noted that Dukakis has
recently said he is a liberal in the tradition of presidents
Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy.
   ``My friends, we are making some progress. After all of these
months, and all of this time, George's opponent has finally come out
of the closet. He has finally embraced the L-word,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan said Mrs. Engeleiter ``stands with George Bush, and her
opponent stands with a certain liberal tank driver.'' Dukakis rode
in a tank during a stop in Sterling Heights, Mich., a photo that has
been used against him in Bush commercials.
   Mrs. Engeleiter is running against Democrat Herbert Kohl for the
seat of Sen. William Proxmire, who is retiring after 31 years in the
Senate.
   ``I believe the Senate could use a mother's perspective, as
well,'' Reagan said.
   After delivering his speech in Ohio, the president drove to a
nearby training field for the Cleveland Browns football team where
he reminisced with the players about his days as a right guard on
his college team and as a radio sports announcer.
   Reagan spoke of missing a block as a player but later,
auditioning for a radio station, recreating it so that he
``delivered a block that was earth shattering.''
   The president hurled the pigskin at tight end Ozzie Newsome and
also threw a pass to Ricky Bolden, an offensive tackle.
   Reagan, queried as to whether his week-long campaign swing for
Bush had done the presidential candidate any good, said, ``I've
tried _ only time will tell.''

<HEAD>Thalidomide Doctor Found Guilty of Scientific Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australian gynecologist William McBride,
who alerted the world to the dangers of the drug thalidomide on
human fetuses in the 1960s, was found guilty of scientific fraud
Wednesday.
   An independent inquiry headed by former High Court Chief Justice
Sir Harry Gibbs found that McBride deliberately falsified the
results of a 1980 experiment on rabbits involving birth defects.
   McBride, 61, immediately resigned as head of research at the
Sydney-based Foundation 41, which he started in 1971 to research
birth defects. The institution was financed by the proceeds of
international awards for his work on thalidomide.
   About 8,000 babies were born around the world with severe
deformities attributed to thalidomide, a sedative administered to
pregnant women, until McBride's findings led to its banning.
   McBride issued a statement through lawyers protesting his
innocence, saying: ``I reject absolutely the finding that scientific
fraud occurred in connection with the experiment.''
   It said he resigned ``because I don't wish that there be any
doubt cast over the work that I and the Foundation have done over
the past 16 years''.
   The foundation's board called the inquiry after pressure from the
scientific community about fraud allegations by two former research
assistants, broadcast on an Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio
program last December.
   Researchers Phil Vardy and Jill French said that McBride reported
in a 1982 edition of the Australian Journal of Biological Sciences
that two of eight rabbits given the drug Scopolamine Hydrobromide
produced deformed fetuses.
   Vardy and French claimed that in fact only one of six rabbits
produced deformed offspring, that a dosage table was altered and
that the article falsely reported that fetuses were sectioned and
control rabbits were kept.
   Gibbs and two medical researchers began hearing evidence in
secret in July.
   In a 25-page report released late Wednesday, they supported the
allegations and found that McBride ``deliberately falsified'' the
contents of the article.
   ``The experiment mentioned in that paper was not conducted in
accordance with proper scientific method and was not honestly
reported,'' they found.
   ``The above experiment and its published results does suggest
that in relation to the publication of those results Dr. McBride was
lacking in scientific integrity.''
   The report said McBride claimed in evidence that a drug company
was out to destroy his credibility as a witness in legal action by
users of a morning sickness drug. But it said no evidence of bias
was found among the witnesses against him.
   Foundation 41's board said in a statement it accepted McBride's
resignation as honorary medical director of the foundation ``with
regret'' and appreciated his offer to continue to serve while a
replacement was found.

   A premature baby who was kidnapped from
a hospital by a woman posing as a nurse could die without proper
treatment, authorities said Wednesday.
   Christopher Michael Jones, who was six weeks premature when born
Saturday at Doctors Hospital, was taken from his mother Tuesday
night.
   On Wednesday, at a news conference, Annette Jones-Thomas pleaded
for her baby's return.
   ``Please, if you have my child, please return him,'' Mrs.
Jones-Thomas said. ``He needs medical attention and if you have him
for the reason of taking him as your child and raising him and
loving him, do what a good mother would do. Bring him to the
hospital and let him get help.''
   The baby weighed only four pounds and must be fed every three
hours because he is small, Dr. Whit Hall said. The doctor said the
infant also must be kept warm.
   ``The baby's blood sugar can get very low and we were watching it
carefully in the hospital. If it gets too low it can cause seizures
or even death within a relatively short period of time,'' Hall said.
   The child was taken from Mrs. Jones-Thomas in her fourth-floor
room just after 10 p.m. Tuesday by a woman who was dressed in a
white pleated skirt and a white sweater, police and hospital
officials reported.
   Mrs. Jones-Thomas, 32, who appeared at the news conference with
her husband, Willie Jones, 39, said she did not know the kidnapper.
She described the woman as black, about 20 years old, 5-foot-4, 135
pounds, with black shoulder-length hair.
   The woman said she needed to weigh the baby, Mrs. Jones-Thomas
said.
   The ruse was discovered about 30 minutes later, when a nurse came
into the room to take the baby to the nursery, officials said.
   Police were contacted shortly after 11 p.m. and searched the area
with dogs but found nothing.
   Mrs. Jones-Thomas said the baby has black straight hair and a
reddish tint to his face. He also has a growth on his right ear.
   Doctors Hospital offered a $10,000 reward for the return of the
baby, the Little Rock Childrens Clinic offered $1,000 and Protecting
Arkansas Children Together added another $1,000.
   Geri Frances Vaughters, a hospital technician, said she saw a
woman fitting the description of the kidnapper before the incident.
Ms. Vaughters said she thought the woman was a visitor.
   Security at the hospital remains the same, but spokeswoman
Jessica Szenher said patients have been warned to ask for
identification from anyone entering their rooms.
   The kidnapper was not wearing a nurses' identification tag, Ms.
Szenher said. Police Sgt. Larry Dunnington said authorities didn't
know how the woman entered or left the hospital.
   There are 20 entrances to the hospital and all but four were
locked at 9:15 p.m., according to security records.
   Dunnington said he believes the kidnapper is still in the state,
but declined to elaborate. He said the Little Rock police department
has nearly 20 detectives working on the case.
   Dr. Terry Jefferson, one of the Jones' pediatricians, said of the
kidnapping, ``You don't think of it happening in Little Rock ...
more in New York or California.''

   A jet plane that apparently lost power
crashed in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains on Wednesday,
killing all three Federal Aviation Administration employees aboard,
officials said.
   FAA spokesmen said the three were making a routine check of a
Pennsylvania airport's instrument landing system.
   The pilot told the FAA's Cleveland Flight Center about a ``power
problem'' just before the crash, said FAA spokesman Pete Nelson.
   The pilot's precise words, which were recorded, were not
immediately available, Nelson said.
   The crash occurred in a wooded area about 45 miles east of
Pittsburgh.
   FAA officials said the victims were pilot James E. Burger, 64, of
Linwood, N.J.; co-pilot Richard M. Wadsworth, 46, of Ocean City,
N.J.; and technician Theodore L. Burdick, 56, of Egg Harbor
Township, N.J.
   Burger had 17,000 hours of flight time, said FAA spokeswoman
Holly Baker.
   The National Transportation Safety Board began an investigation
into the accident.
   The twin-engine plane took off from Allegheny County Airport on
Wednesday morning to test the electronic signal emitted from an
instrument landing system, an FAA official said.

   The state's police training director
resigned Wednesday and his replacement immediately abolished a
program that led to hospitalization of 16 cadets at a training
academy in Agawam.
   ``We can never allow what happened at Agawam to happen again,''
said Peter W. Agnes Jr., who was appointed interim director as the
Criminal Justice Training Council accepted the resignation of
executive director Gary F. Egan. The council operates the state's
police training centers, including the one for state police at
Agawam.
   State Attorney General James Shannon found after an investigation
the Agawam training program was a ``massive failure.''
   He blamed it for kidney ailments suffered by 26 of 50 cadets in
one class, and the critical condition of Timothy M. Shepard, 25, of
Pittsfield, who has lapsed back into a coma after a liver transplant.
   Shepard collapsed on Sept. 19, the first day of training at
Agawam. Cadets in the class reported they were pushed to the limits
of their endurance with hours of running, pushups and other
exercises that day on just a few small cups of water, according to
Shannon.
   Shannon said he would not prosecute, but said the chief of the
agency responsible for the training should resign or be dismissed.
   Egan's letter of resignation, read by council Chairman John P.
McHugh, offered no reasons for his departure. He had been on paid
leave.
   Agnes, an assistant to state Secretary of Public Safety Charles
V. Barry, said he expects to make personnel changes, although he
would not be specific. He also rescinded the council's program known
as ``modified stress training,'' which combines constant exercise
for cadets and unexpected situations during training.
   Barry said he favors legislation making his office, and
ultimately the governor, responsible for hiring and firing executive
directors. He said he does not have a candidate in mind for the
permanent director position, but one should be appointed before the
next class begins Dec. 16.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain
told the Polish premier Wednesday she sees similarities between
changes she has made in Britain and the difficult choices facing
Poland, a British official said.
   He said Mrs. Thatcher, who turned Britain away from socialism,
told Premier Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski of this troubled communist
nation: ``The problem is that the difficulties always come first,
before the successes.''
   Rakowski has pledged to revitalize Poland's economy and
restructure its industry.
   Both Rakowski's government and the opposition, led by the
outlawed Solidarity free trade union, hope to use Mrs. Thatcher's
three-day visit to advance their arguments on the proper pace and
direction of political and economic reform in Poland.
   It appeared, however, that Mrs. Thatcher would tread a wary line.
The British official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mrs.
Thatcher told the premier she had no desire to interfere in internal
Polish affairs.
   She arrived in a Royal Air Force jet and received a low-key
welcome from Rakowski at Warsaw's military airport.
   ``Hail, soldiers!'' Mrs. Thatcher said in Polish to a military
honor guard turned out to greet her.
   ``Hail, citizen premier,'' the honor guard replied, in unison,
also in Polish.
   Neither Mrs. Thatcher nor Rakowski, the Communist Party
propaganda chief who became premier Sept. 27, made public remarks at
the airport. They left immediately for a government guest house.
   State media have been calling attention to parallels between
Rakowski's goals and the success of Thatcherism in Britain _
including her tackling of trade unions and paring back of outdated,
state-subsidized industry.
   According to the British official, Rakowski said he was
determined to revive the economy although it was ``hard to have a
Marxist closing down Lenin.'' His reference was to Monday's
government order to shut the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, birthplace of
the outlawed union Solidarity, for economic reasons Dec. 1.
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa says the move is political, aimed
at punishing the yard for its support of Solidarity and depriving
the union of one of its most important bases.
   Walesa plans to greet Mrs. Thatcher on Friday when she becomes
the first Western head of government to travel to Gdansk to meet
him. Walesa made clear Wednesday his admiration of the Conservative
Party leader's hard-line approach to communism, but was less
enthusiastic about her domestic policies.
   ``I, Lech Walesa, and the whole of Polish society respect Mrs.
Margaret Thatcher, even love her,'' he told reporters in Gdansk.
``But the Mrs. Thatcher of foreign policy, not for the domestic
affairs of Britain.''
   On Wednesday evening, Mrs. Thatcher began her private schedule
with a one-hour call at the residence of Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the
Roman Catholic primate, followed by a meeting with six prominent
intellectuals that lasted more than an hour.
   The British official said she was warmly received by Glemp,
spiritual leader of the vast majority of Poland's 38 million people
who consider themselves Catholic.
   She told Glemp she wished ``to encourage those wanting to move
down the road to freedom,'' the official said, but noted again she
did not mean to interfere in Polish affairs.
   Aleksander Paszynski, one of intellectuals and a proponent of
private enterprise, said they stressed the ``unbreakable link
between economic and political reforms and the (government's) need
of gaining social support'' for any reform plan.
   ``It was a wonderful discussion, marvelous,'' Mrs. Thatcher told
reporters afterward.
   Her schedule Thursday includes meetings with Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, and a banquet at which she is
expected to make the major speech of her visit.
   She also is to visit the grave of a pro-Solidarity priest, the
Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, slain in 1984 by security officers who were
later tried and imprisoned.
   On Friday, Mrs. Thatcher flies with Jaruzelski to Gdansk where
together they visit the Westerplatte penisula where German naval
forces opened fire on Sept. 1, 1939, in the opening shots of World
War II.
   Jaruzelski then returns to Warsaw while Mrs. Thatcher meets with
Walesa and other Solidarity leaders and visits the monument to slain
shipyard workers erected just outside the Lenin shipyard.
   Another meeting with Jaruzelski and a news conference closes out
the first visit by a British prime minister to Poland.
   Polish officials have been very eager for the visit and Warsaw
was festooned with Polish flags flying alongside the Union Jack in
greeting. Most newspapers carried her photo and a brief biography on
front pages.
   Officials want to convince Mrs. Thatcher of their seriousness in
reforming the economy, hoping that she will use her influence to
open up Western credits that were virtually closed off when martial
law was imposed in December in 1981.
   In addition to outdated industries, Poland has the East bloc's
largest foreign debt, approaching $40 billion, and would like new
financing to ease the debt burden.

   An investigating committee decided Wednesday to call
the finance minister's former top aide and two other witnesses to
testify about an insider-trading stock scandal involving senior
politicians.
   The special parliamentary committee said it would call Tsuneo
Hattori, former secretary to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and
business associates Yasufumi Kawai and Shigeo Sugawara.
   They will be asked about their roles in buying stock of the real
estate firm Recruit-Cosmos Co., in Miyazawa's name, before it was
put on public sale. No date for their appearance was set.
   Opposition parties accuse Hiromasa Ezoe, founder of the parent
Recruit Inc., of making advance shares of Recruit-Cosmos available
to politicians, business leaders and journalists in return for
privileges or favors.
   When Recruit-Cosmos was listed on the over-the-counter market in
October 1986, the stock's value soared and those who had bought it
in advance made huge profits.
   A 13th politician became associated with the scandal Wednesday
when Katsuya Ikeda admitted that his brother bought advance shares
of Recruit-Cosmos. Ikeda, deputy secretary-general of the opposition
Komeito (Clean Government) Party, said in a televised news
conference he had no knowledge of the purchase.
   Finance Minister Miyazawa told the investigating committee last
week the sale of 10,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares in 1986 yielded a
profit of 22.7 million yen (then about $140,000), but said he did
not know the transaction was made in his name.
   He said Kawai, a business acquaintance of his former secretary
Hattori, asked the aide to let Miyazawa's name be used in the
purchase of Recruit-Cosmos shares from Sugawara, chairman of Do Best
Inc.
   Japanese media have said Do Best, a cosmetics importer, was the
middleman in the advance sale. The newspaper Asahi reported
Wednesday that Sugawara and Ezoe of Recruit Inc. were university
classmates in the early 1960s and Ezoe helped Sugawara set up his
company in 1974.
   The government has said the transactions were not illegal, but
the case raises ethical questions about the intimate links between
business and politics in Japan. Parliament tightened insider-trading
laws after the scandal broke last summer.

Security</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin, NATO
commander in Europe, said Wednesday that an ``atmosphere of
delusion'' that the Soviets are no longer a military threat could
seriously weaken Western security.
   ``Intentions can change overnight,'' Galvin cautioned. ``I do not
want to find military capablilites lowered in the West, and then see
for one reason or another a change in the atmosphere in the East.''
   Galvin, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, was guest speaker
of the Bonn-based Konrad Adenauer Foundation think tank.
   He said that in the West there is a ``wishful thinking and
willingness to believe that some grand change has already taken
place in terms of the danger to the West from the size of the
military in the East.
   ``This willingness is causing the West to get deeper into a
situation in which support for deterrence and defense may be
seriously weakened.
   ``There is an atmosphere of delusion and a willingness to accept
that delusion.''
   Galvin said political changes in the Soviet Union, and their
effects on other East bloc nations, should not be allowed to result
in weakened Western defenses.
   ``The Soviet Union is certainly undergoing enormous internal
changes, and these have their effects externally,'' he said.
   ``As we look at what those effects will be, there is a great
element of unpredictability and possibly instability in this
transition which appears to be beginning to take place in the East.''
   The commander also said the Soviet military continues to pose a
serious threat to the West.
   ``The Soviet Union has indicated it is really no longer as
offensive as it was before, and is in fact defensive, and is much
less a threat _ that is rhetoric,'' he said.
   ``The Soviet Union today is producing about the same amount of
military armaments as it was producing when (Soviet President
Mikhail) Gorbachev took office'' in 1985.
   He said that according to the latest NATO estimates, the Warsaw
Pact has 30,900 tanks while the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
has about 20,000.
   Galvin reiterated his support for modernizing NATO short-range
nuclear weapons based in Western Europe as a means of offsetting
superior Warsaw Pact conventional forces.
   He said he opposes easing Western restrictions on exporting
high-technology goods to the East bloc.

   Sen. Dan Quayle, an ardent opponent of
abortion, said Wednesday he has no quarrel with a medical procedure
that he said is aimed at preventing conception after rape.
   The Republican vice presidential nominee said he would not
``construe that as being an abortion.''
   Quayle refused to acknowledge that the post-rape medical
procedure known as dilation and curettage, or D-and-C _ would amount
to abortion in the event that conception had occurred.
   ``Well, my position is that I understand from a medical situation
that, immediately after rape, that is reported, that a woman
normally, in fact, can go to the hospital and have a D-and-C at that
time, that is before the actual forming of a life,'' he said when
faced with the theoretical question of whether rape victims should
be allowed to have abortions.
   Quayle has repeatedly said in the past that he would accept
abortion only if it were necessary to save the life of the mother _
and he reiterated that position during a news conference here.
   But when asked pointedly whether he would expect a rape victim to
have the rapist's baby, he said, ``Hopefully they would seek medical
attention immediately, and under normal medical procedure, life and
conception would not even begin.''
   Quayle said that while his personal preference is that there
should be no abortion except to save a mother's life, a woman may
legally have the pregnancy terminated.
   Leonard Dinger, a spokesman for the National Right-to-Life
Committee in Washington, said, ``Our position is that there are
certain medical procedures that can prevent conception within 24
hours of that (rape) taking place.''
   ``If conception had already taken place, we would oppose it,'' he
said.
   Dr. Robert Shesser, a specialist in emergency care medicine at
George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, said in a
telephone interview that D-and-C is not the medical treatment most
immediately used for rape victims.
   Once it has been determined that conception has taken place, he
said in an interview, the victim is offered a so-called ``morning
after'' pill aimed at changing her body chemistry in a way to make
the uterus unreceptive to the growth of a fertilized egg.
   ``D-and-C is not an immediate post-rape procedure,'' Shesser
said, adding that emergency room physicians seldom resort to that
procedure, which is a scraping of the uterine lining.
   Quayle said Tuesday he favors having the Supreme Court overturn
the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion, and said it
should be revert to a ``state's rights'' issue.
   On Wednesday, he was asked, theoretically whether a woman
impregnated through rape should be expected to bring the fetus to
full term.
   ``No, I understand that the medical procedure, a normal D-and-C,
right after rape, that you would not even get into a conception and
life would not even be formed,'' he said. ``That's my understanding
from a medical point of view, and therefore you wouldn't even get
into life being ... .''
   When asked how he would view a D-and-C if conception had taken
place, Quayle said, ``Doing it under this particular type of
situation, it's a normal medical procedure and I do not construe
that as being an abortion.''
   Pressed to explain his position further, he said, ``I think that
reporting of the rape, going into the hospital and, right after
that, having a D-and-C, I think is a perfectly normal response and
one that I would not put in the category of abortion.''
   As he headed toward his plane on leaving Memphis, Quayle was
asked again about his statements and told inquiring reporters, ``I
think it really is nit-picking (to question his abortion stand)
because of the votes that we have had'' against abortion.
   ``You're getting all sorts of very difficult medical
terminologies,'' he said. ``And you know what my position on
abortion is.''
   ``You're getting into all sorts of difficult sensitive areas that
I don't have all the answers to,'' the senator said.
   Quayle also said that ``I don't perceive'' that having the E and
C procedure right after a rape ``as being tantamount to abortion.''
   Quayle began his campaign day by fielding questions from local
reporters, at which time the abortion issue surfaced, and making
appearances at a high school rally and senior citizen's center. He
was traveling to Owensboro, Ky. later in the day.
   Questions about abortion have hounded Quayle in recent days,
particularly following his suggestion to a 12-year-old girl that she
should go ahead and give birth in a theoretical situation in which
she was raped by her father and became pregnant.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, campaigning in
California earlier this week, jumped on Quayle's statement, given
during an interview with a ``Children's Express'' reporter.
   Dukakis said such statements proved that the Republican Party has
``been on the wrong side of every issue of importance to women.''

<HEAD>Group Buys 1930s Shotgun Shanties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A charity group has bought 19 shotgun shacks
for $1 or $2 each and plans to turn the shanties into emergency
shelters for the rural poor.
   Madison Countians Allied Against Poverty won on bids submitted
Tuesday to the Board of Alderman on 19 of 20 homes. The buildings
made up a shantytown on the edge of Canton, which is 20 miles north
of Jackson.
   Sister Mary McGuire, executive director of the group, said the
renovated houses will be used to help people like one Madison County
family currently living in a house ``where you almost fall through
the floor when you walk in.''
   ``We're interested in helping a couple of burned-out families and
we're interested in using them for several families out in the
country that live in housing that is in a dilapidated condition,''
she said.
   She also said the shacks could be used ``as a room added on to an
existing house.''
   The shanties were built in the 1930s to house lumberyard workers.
The one- and two-room, tin roof buildings lack electricity and
indoor plumbing.
   City officials bought the property in September and wanted to
tear down the dilapidated structures and offer the site for
development.
   But the state Department of Archives and History, saying the
structures had historical architectural significance, asked city
officials to take bids on the houses instead.
   MadCAAP won the first 19 bids, but Moses Wright of Canton bid
$500 on the 20th shack and assumed ownership of the building. He did
not indicate how he intended to use it.
   The charity group is making plans to move the rundown shacks, and
estimates it will cost about $800 to $1,000 each. Sister McGuire
said volunteers will help with the renovations.
   The organization's bids were welcomed by Mayor Sidney Runnels,
who had expressed hope the group would get some of the houses.
   ``I think it's a good cause,'' Runnels said. ``We're very
supportive of what they are doing.''
   The homes can't be used as residences within the city because
they don't meet the city code.
   Only three families still live in the shantytown, and they are
expected to be relocated by the end of this month. The city, using
money from a block grant, has been relocating residents of the
shantytown since August.

   Palestinians said the strong showing of
right-wing parties in Israel's elections would feed the 11-month-old
rebellion in the occupied lands, where soldiers killed one Arab on
Wednesday and wounded at least 29.
   Said Kenaan, a businessman in Nablus, said the Israeli electorate
had rejected peace efforts and was determined to keep all the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 war.
   ``It's obvious Israelis don't want peace, but we will hit back,''
he declared. ``The moderate voice in the Palestinian camp is
finished.''
   Kenaan supports the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr, said giving
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc and its right-wing allies
the chance of forming a government meant voting for ``more tension
and confrontation.''
   ``The Palestinians will now only intensify their efforts to end
the occupation and achieve national rights,'' he said.
   Wednesday's death brought to at least 306 the number of
Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. Ten Israelis
also have been slain.
   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza closed their shops and
halted transportation Wednesday, the anniversary of the Balfour
declaration of Nov. 2, 1917, in which Britain recognized the Zionist
movement's goal of a Jewish state in Palestine. They also held a
general strike Tuesday, election day.
   Several violent incidents were reported in the occupied
territories.
   Army spokesmen said soldiers shot and killed a 20-year-old
Palestinian who confronted them when they chased masked Palestinian
youths into his home at Qalqiliya, a West Bank town.
   Arab witnesses identified the victim as Jalal Fayoumi and said
his 45-year-old mother, Mahdieh, suffered a gunshot wound. The army
spokesman's office confirmed the wounding.
   Officials at Arab hospitals said an 18-year-old youth was wounded
in the stomach during the confrontation at Qalqiliya.
   Eighteen Palestinians were wounded in other incidents, two of
them seriously in the chest and stomach, hospital officials said.
The army said it was checking the casualty reports.
   The army command said a soldier was hit and injured by a building
block in Nablus and that troops shot and wounded nine Palestinians
in disturbances in the Gaza Strip.
   In the Arab quarter of Jabl Mukabar in Arab east Jerusalem,
border police fired after a Palestinian tried to seize a policeman's
gun, police spokesman Rafi Levy said. He said police later arrested
eight Palestinians.
   Among hard-line parties winning places in the Knesset, the
120-member Israeli parliament, was one that advocates expelling the
1.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza to Arab
countries. Its name, Moledet, means Homeland in Hebrew.
   Shamir has vowed never to return any of the land Israel captured
in 1967, but Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and his rival Labor Party
favor trading some of it for peace. Labor and Likud have been in a
tenuous ``national unity'' coalition since the indecisive 1984
election.
   Siniora said most Palestinians greeted the election result with
gloom, but felt a right-wing government at least would ``finally
make decision-making possible. The decision will either be for peace
or for carrying out the right-wing platform of non-withdrawal, which
will lead to confrontation with the Palestinians and the Arab
countries.''
   Asaad Saftawi, 55, a PLO supporter from the Gaza Strip, said, ``A
Likud-led government will destroy a golden opportunity for peace.''

   Leaders of the right-wing Likud bloc expressed
confidence they could form a government and began coalition talks
Wednesday with four ultra-Orthodox religious parties that will
decide who will govern the nation.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud and its allies won 46 of
the 120 seats in Tuesday's election. Labor and sympathetic left-wing
parties won 49, so either major party could form a government with
support from the religious factions, which won a total of 18 seats.
   Two parties on the extreme left won the other seven seats.
   Although Likud generally is more sympathetic to the Orthodox
view, one of the main religious parties said a coalition remained
possible with Labor, by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   Demands by the religious parties include strict rules on
observing the sabbath and changes in the policy that extends
automatic citizenship to all Jews, including converts.
   The toll rose in the 11-month-old rebellion in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which was a major issue in the election.
   Soldiers shot a Palestinian to death in the West Bank town of
Qalqiliya, bringing to at least 306 the number killed since the
uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Ten Israelis also have been slain.
   Likud won 39 seats on its own in the Knesset, as Israel calls its
parliament, and Labor got 38, according to the nearly final count of
Tuesday's vote.
   Shamir said early Wednesday the outcome ``commanded'' Likud to
form a government and expressed willingness to negotiate on any
demands of the regigious parties. Likud and Labor have been in a
fragile coalition since the indecisive election of July 1984.
   Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for Shamir, said religious leaders told
the prime minister ``Likud has natural sympathy to religious demands
and all would prefer a coalition with Likud over Labor.''
   After meeting with Peres, however, spokesman Moshe Peretz of the
Torah Guardians Party said: ``We feel that all options are open. We
don't rule out talks with any party. The conditions are that they
come to terms with our requirements.''
   His party, known by its Hebrew initials SHAS, won 6 Knesset seats.
   Most religious legislators are closer to Shamir's viewpoint on
the Palestinian issue. He vows to keep all the occupied territories,
which some Orthodox consider part of biblical Israel, but Peres has
expressed willingness to exchange some territory for peace.
   Other demands by the Orthodox, whose political clout is greater
than their numbers, make both major parties uneasy.
   Most controversial is a change in the law under which converts
would be considered Jewish in Israel, and eligible for automatic
citizenship, only if they were converted by Orthodox rabbis.
   ``Without a real promise on this `Who-is-a-Jew' question we will
not go into any coalition,'' said Avraham Verdiger of the Agudat
Israel faction, which won five seats.
   Such an amendment could alienate American Jews, most of whom
belong to the Conservative and Reform movements of Judaism. Labor
has opposed such changes in the law.
   Other demands mentioned by leaders of the religious parties
include prohibiting soccer games and closing theaters and
restaurants on the sabbath and increasing military exemptions for
seminary students.
   Yitzhak Peretz, leader of the Torah Guardian party, said Likud
appeared more likely to meet at least some religious demands, then
added: ``I wouldn't say only the Likud can do it, but that Likud
appears the more reasonable prospects.''
   Spokesmen for both Likud and Labor said they would have no
comment on the demands because negotiations were in the early stages.
   Observers attributed some of the success of the ultra-Orthodox
parties to the highly organized efforts of the Habad Hassidim. Its
head, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of the Brooklyn, N.Y.,-based
Lubavitcher group, offered personal blessings as a reward to
volunteers who canvassed towns.
   The daily Haaretz said more than 1,000 ultra-Orthodox voters flew
in from Europe and the United States to cast their ballots. Israeli
law prevents absentee voting.
   The high political price set by religious parties has forced
Likud to consider inviting Labor into another coalition, this time
as junior partner rather than an equal.
   Ahimeir quoted Shamir as saying he would consider it, and Labor
Party officials reported behind-the-scenes contacts with the Likud.
   By law, Israel's president decides which party will be asked to
form a government.
   President Chaim Herzog told Shamir on Wednesday he will not begin
consultations until the official election results are published late
next week.
   Israeli officials estimated coalition bargaining could take two
months, with the current coalition serving as caretaker.

<HEAD>Court Sentences Palestinian Hijacker To 25 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court sentenced a Palestinian to the
maximum 25 years in prison Wednesday after he admitted killing two
women passengers during a 1985 hijacking penalty.
   Judge Wallace Gunia pronounced sentence on Omar Mohammed Ali
Rezaq, 25, after a two-day trial. Rezak pleaded guilty Tuesday to
seven charges.
   The Lebanese-born Rezaq was the lone survivor of three
Palestinian gunmen who seized an Egyptair Boeing 737 flying from
Athens to Cairo on Nov. 23, 1985.
   He stood motionless and made no comment when the judge pronounced
sentence.
   Rezak pleaded guilty to killing Scarlet Maria Rogenkamp, of
Oceanside, Calif., and Nitzan Mendelson, an Israeli woman, after
denying the charges in pre-trial testimony.
   The two women were forced to go to the doorway of the plane after
Jewish and American passengers were singled out. The two were shot
and thrown from the plane to the tarmac.
   Rezaq had told the court he belonged to the Egyptian
Revolutionary Organization. He said it was made up of people from
Lebanon, Tunisia and Egypt, but gave no details.
   Rezaq also admitted to the attempted killing of four other
people: two Americans, Patrick Scott Baker of White Salmon, Wash.,
and Jackie Pflug of Pasadena, Texas; and two Israelis.
   he said the hijacking was a protest against Egypt's political
system, which he claimed was ``destroying the future of the
Palestinians.''
   Sixty people died in the hijacking and the storming of the plane
by Egyptian soldiers.

<TEXT>
   A judge declared a mistrial Wednesday in a probate
court dispute in which the former head of the American Psychiatric
Association is accused of exploiting a wealthy patient.
   Cook County Judge Frank Petrone ordered the jury excused in the
midst of the opening statements by an attorney for Dr. George
Pollock, an executor of the estate of Anne P. Lederer, who died in
1984 at age 78.
   The legal battle is between Pollock, one of Chicago's leading
psychoanalysts, and Francis L. Lederer II, the only child of Mrs.
Lederer.
   Mrs. Lederer left most of her estimated $5 million estate to a
non-profit institute she established four years earlier to promote
psychiatric research and music. None of the money has been paid,
however, while her son has contested the case in court.
   Mrs. Lederer's will leaves $200,000 to her son and several
thousand dollars to two grandchildren.
   In 1976, Mrs. Lederer set up a fund that has paid Pollock $50,000
a year and will continue paying him through 1993. She established a
second trust that has paid Pollock's family $30,000 a year since
1978. Court records are not clear when the second trust expires.
   In his opening statement Wednesday, Pollock's attorney, Robert
Tepper, said Mrs. Lederer had previously set up a $2 million
irrevocable trust for her son. The trust was not part of the will.
   ``She later decided it was a mistake to make the trust
irrevocable and told people the only thing her son wanted from her
was her money,'' Tepper told the jury.
   Lederer's attorney Philip Doran objected to the comment, and
after confering with the lawyers, Petrone told the panel that he was
declaring a mistrial because the remark was prejudicial. He
discharged the jury.
   Pollock, who was present in the courtroom, and Tepper made no
comment.
   Lederer says Pollock improperly used his influence over Mrs.
Lederer to urge her to establish the institute, which promotes
psychiatric research and music.
   Pollock conducted up to five sessions a week with Mrs. Lederer
from 1969 to 1980, when he transferred her case to two other
psychiatrists, saying he needed more time for other professional
duties, court documents show.
   Pollock continued prescribing medication for her until 1983, and
records show he told the succeeding psychiatrists in a letter:
``Incidentally, I do hope that you are charging her a full fee for
your housecalls and visits. She can well afford it.''
   In an affidavit Dec. 4, 1986, Pollock denied the allegations
against him.
   In his opening statement, Richard Phelan, the lawyer for the
research institute, said establishing the organization ``is clearly
what she (Mrs. Lederer) wanted to do.''
   ``She wanted to create a foundation and a trust that would bear
her name so that people would remember her as a woman who gave her
monies to charity,'' he said.
   Tepper was the third and last lawyer making an opening statement
to the jury, which took four days to be selected.
   No date for selecting a new jury in the probate dispute was set.
Lawyers were scheduled to meet with Petrone on Thursday.

<HEAD>Spanish Officials Say Prison Where US Man Held Receives Notice of
Release</HEAD>

   Spanish Embassy officials say a formal notice
of release was delivered Wednesday to the Spanish prison where a
photographer from Virginia is scheduled to be released to the U.S.
government.
   Conan Owen, 24, of Annandale, Va., has been imprisoned since
March 1987 on cocaine trafficking charges. U.S. officials say Owen
was set up by drug smugglers, and Spanish officials announced Friday
that Owen would be transferred to the United States to complete his
six-year sentence.
   ``A formal notice of agreement of the Spanish government was
given a few hours ago to the jail in Barcelona by the Spanish
Ministry of Justice,'' Spanish Embassy spokeswoman Helga Soto said
Wednesday evening.
   She said she did not know the exact date of Owen's release.
   ``I think it is a fast process, but I don't know when it will
take place,'' Soto said.
   U.S. officials have the authority to parole Owen as soon as he
arrives.
   ``You pray that it was yesterday, hope it will be tomorrow and
expect the end of the month,'' said Ernest Owen, Conan's father,
after learning of the transfer of papers.
   ``This is probably the first of a number of administrative
steps,'' Ernest Owen said. ``The hurdle was the agreement by the
Spanish government to release him, and that's been cleared.''
   He said he had not been notified by the embassy of any official
action.
   The Owen family has waged an unflagging campaign to convince U.S.
authorities that their son had been duped into acting as a drug
courier.
   Their efforts eventually led to a U.S. prosecutor in Alexandria,
Va., a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Madrid, DEA
Administrator John C. Lawn and ultimately then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III to conclude that Owen was innocent of the
trafficking charges.
   An Alexandria, Va., resident, George Barahona, admitted in
February that he and others _ without Owen's knowledge _ hid four
pounds of cocaine in a false bottom of a suitcase that they then
asked Owen to take to Barcelona.
   Owen had been hired to do freelance photography work for Barahona
in Spain.
   At the time, a Justice Department spokesman said Meese was
confident that the court papers, including a polygraph test passed
by Owen, would convince Spanish authorities to drop the charges.
   In April 1987, however, a court in Barcelona found Owen guilty of
drug trafficking, sentencing him to six years and a day in prison
and imposing an $18,000 fine. In a written opinion, the judges said
they rejected Barahona's confession because it was obtained as part
of a plea bargain, which is illegal in Spain.
   Owen became eligible to return to the United States under an
international treaty governing exchanges of sentenced prisoners. To
become eligible for return under the treaty, Owen had to drop his
appeal of his conviction in Spanish courts.

   Four religious parties _ potential king-makers
after Israel's inconclusive elections _ are demanding a high price
for their support: no soccer or movies on the Sabbath and control
over conversions to Judaism.
   Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox parties scored a stunning surprise by
amassing 18 seats Tuesday in the 120-member parliament, an increase
of four seats from 1984.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres' left-leaning Labor Party finished in virtual
deadlock. They want to end their joint rule but neither can form a
government without at least some religious support.
   Religious parties sought Cabinet posts such as the ministries of
religion, education and housing. They also demanded public
entertainment be outlawed on the biblically mandated day of rest.
   Avraham Shapira of the Agudat Israel party, which won five seats,
said that on the Sabbath, theaters should be shut and soccer games
rescheduled.
   ``I am sure, the Lord willing, that on the Sabbath movie houses
will be closed,'' he said. ``Non-religious Jews have televisions at
home. They can watch TV.''
   Secular leaders warned the rise of Jewish fundamentalism could
foreshadow a new era of bans on freedom of action similar to those
imposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution in Iran.
   ``If we all get religious, who will sit in the ships and the
tanks when the right-wing messianic composition that we witness
brings war upon us,'' Shulamit Aloni, leader of the liberal,
anti-religious Citizens Rights Movement, said on Israel radio.
   Religious party leaders have said their major goal is stopping
what they see as a moral decline but refraining from coercion.
   ``I want to tell the general public that we have no intentions to
impose,'' said Avner Shaki, leader of the National Religious Party,
which won five seats.
   ``We only want to give the Jewish public a clearly Jewish
character, which is required by ... the fact that Israel is a Jewish
state,'' he said.
   Heading the Orthodox agenda is a demand to revise Israel's Law of
Return, which grants automatic citizenship to all Jews. Religious
parties want the state to recognize as Jewish only those born to a
Jewish mother or converted by an Orthodox rabbi.
   Changing the law would alienate American Jews. Interfaith
marriages are on the rise in the United States where the majority of
the 5 million Jews belong to Reform or Conservative movements.
   Religious parties seek to toughen laws against abortion,
Christian missionary activites, the performing of autopsies and
archaeological digs near cemeteries.
   Chaim Bergman, news editor of Agudat Israel's daily newspaper
Hamoudia, said ultra-Orthodox Jews were divided on the lengths to
which Israel could go in trading territory for peace with the Arabs
as proposed by Labor.
   ``We are more or less with the line of Likud on the need for
autonomy for Palestinans,'' said Bergman. ``You can say we are
opposed to giving back territory, but not at any price.''
   Only the National Religious Party has given a high priority to
the issue, arguing that Israel must keep the West Bank and Gaza
Strip seized in the 1967 war.
   Labor is most ardently courting Shas, which won six seats and is
committed to preserving the traditions of Sephardic Jews from
Islamic countries. Allied with Shas is the Torah Flag party which
won two seats and is a breakway from Agudat Israel.
   Shas spokesman Moshe Peretz said ``we have a stronger affinity to
the right, although we don't reject categorically that we will find
a way with Labor.''
   Shmuel Sandler, a social scientist from the religious Bar Ilan
University near Tel Aviv, said religious groups which had remained
aloof from politics in the past launched a well-organized campaign.
   ``It came as a complete surprise. Nobody expected it,'' he said,
adding the religious parties apparently foresaw Israel was deeply
split and they could control the balance of power.
   One reason for the surprise was that public opinion pollsters do
not venture into tightly knit, ultra-Orthodox communities where
residents often refuse to cooperate. Pre-election polls indicated
the religious would only get 10 to 12 seats.
   Observers attributed some of ultra-Orthodox success to the entry
of the highly organized Habad Hassidim headed by the Brooklyn,
N.Y.,-based Lubavitcher Rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson.
   Bergman noted the popular rabbi offered personal blessings as an
inducement to volunteers who canvassed towns in vans, handing out
literature and putting up posters.
   The daily Haaretz said more than 1,000 ultra-Orthodox voters flew
in election day from Europe and the United States to cast their
ballots. Israeli law prevents absentee voting.

   A federal grand jury returned a fraud
indictment Wednesday against a defense contractor and two men who
were awarded a $7 million contract to a build a weather radar system
for the Air Force.
   The 27-count indictment names Enterprise Electronics Corp., the
company's president C. Neil Braswell, 54, and a former employee,
Michael Trawick, 32, both of New Brockton.
   U.S. Attorney James Wilson said the company and the two men are
charged with trying to defraud the government, making false
statements, and filing false claims in connection with a $7 million
contract the company received to build a weather radar system for 20
military bases.
   According to the indictment, the defendants inflated the cost of
towers, protective devices known as radomes, and color monitor
displays. Also, the charges allege, the two men understated the
profit the company expected to make on the contract, both during
contract negotiations and during an audit.
   None of defendants was immediately available for comment. A woman
who answered the telephone at Enterprise Electronics said Braswell
had left for the day and there would be no comment on the charges
before Thursday.
   Braswell and Trawick did not immediately return messages left at
their homes.
   If convicted, the company could be fined up to $23.5 million.
Braswell could face 130 years in prison and $21.5 million in fines,
and Trawick, who was indicted on an extra count of making false
statements, could be sentenced to 135 years in prison and fined
$21.75 million.
   Wilson said it was the second major indictment in Alabama against
a defense contractor within three weeks, reflecting a re-emphasis on
such cases by Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.
   In the earlier case, Sperry Corp. and Unisys Corp. were accused
of falsely billing the government for more than $5 million in
charges, and retired Air Force Col. Robert L. Hedges, 51, of
Montgomery was accused of negotiating a consulting job with Sperry
while he was overseeing the contract.

<TEXT>
   Student riots spread across Venezuela
Wednesday over the killing of 14 fishermen by Venezuelan troops,
injuring at least 25 students and several police, said student
groups and journalists on the scene.
   Pitched battles took place between students and police and
National Guard units, they said. Clashes were reported at Caracas,
Merida, Maracaibo and Valencia.
   The riots followed violent protests Tuesday in which 12 students
from Caracas' Central University were injured.
   Government officials have called the shooting of the fishermen
last Saturday at the Venezuelan-Colombian border a ``lamentable
confusion.'' Two survivors swore in military court Tuesday they were
simple Venezuelan fishermen and not Colombian leftist guerrillas as
the military originally claimed.
   In the Andes mountains capital of Merida, about 300 miles
southwest of Caracas, students rioted down the main avenue, burning
four cars, sacking stores and breaking the front windows of seven
banks, according to Ramon Diaz Suarez, a reporter for Frontera
newspaper.
   He said 10 students were wounded by shotgun blasts in daylong
battles with police and National Guard units.
   Merida is the site of several universities and home to thousands
of students from across the country.
   Merida state Gov. Orlando Guttierez held emergency meetings with
military authorities to ``determine the necessary steps,'' said Diaz
Suarez.
   Three students in Caracas were wounded in street battles with
police, said a student representative contacted on the campus of
Central University.
   Bernardo Ansidey, president of the student group, said the
students were hit by shotgun blasts Wednesday before they could
retreat to university grounds.
   By law, police are barred from entering the campus and can fire
on the students only if they come out onto the avenues surrounding
the university.
   Ansidey said demonstrations would continue to protest the
shooting of the fishermen near El Amparo, about 365 miles southwest
of Caracas.
   He said students also were demanding the release of Jose Tomas
Pinto, an education student jailed by authorities for ``military
rebellion'' and now on a hunger strike in a Caracas jail.
   Students in universities at Maracaibo, the oil city about 350
miles west of Caracas, and Valencia, about 60 miles west of Caracas,
also burned vehicles and fought with police, reporters said.
   Police in Valencia were ordered to hold their fire and instead
fired tear gas, while students took soda bottles off a delivery
truck and lobbed them at the police, said Maria Luisa Gotto,
reporter for El Carabobeno.
   She said fighting went on nine hours without showing signs of of
letting up, adding that several police were taken to a hospital with
wounds from rocks and bottles.
   Police had no immediate comment on the riots.

   The Roman Catholic Church and
opposition political, labor and business leaders set up a private
relief group Wednesday to solicit international aid for Nicaraguans
left homeless by Hurricane Joan.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, archbishop of Managua, was
elected coordinator of the Complementary Commission, so named
because it is designed to complement government relief efforts.
   About 200,000 Nicaraguans lost their homes when the hurrican
swept across Nicaragua Oct. 22, downing bridges and destroying crops
with torrential rains and winds. The Atlantic coast and the
south-central regions were hardest hit.
   President Daniel Ortega said Friday the storm killed 116 people
and left 110 missing.
   The leftist Sandinista government urgently appealed to the
international community for aid. Reynaldo Antonio Tefel, president
of the government's National Emergency Committee, said Tuesday the
amount of aid received so far _ 2,236 tons of supplies _ would cover
the needs of the homeless for about a month.
   Other representatives to the newly formed relief group include:
Mauricio Diaz, a leader of the Popular Social Christian Party;
Virgilio Godoy of the Liberal Independent Party; Gilberto Cuadra of
the Superior Private Enterprise Council; Gustavo Tablada of the
Nicaraguan Socialist Party; and Pablo Antonio Cuadra, director of
the opposition newspaper La Prensa.
   The group said in a statement it was ``provisional'' and that
other non-governmental organizations could participate.
   On Wednesday, the international relief organization World Vision
flew about $67,000 worth of supplies from Newark, N.J. to hurricane
victims here in what organizers said was the first such effort from
the East Coast.
   The supplies included 14,000 blankets, said Mike Schwager, a
group spokesman. He said World Vision sent other supplies, including
water-purifying tablets and tents, in an airlift from Los Angeles
last week.

   After refusing to speak to reporters since his
criminal indictment nearly two weeks ago, deposed Philippine
president Ferdinand Marcos lashed out at the news media Wednesday.
   The media ``has declared President Ferdinand Marcos guilty of
several charges filed against him,'' Marcos said in a statement
issued through aide Arturo Aruiza. ``Whatever happened to the
time-honored legal maxim that anyone is presumed innocent unless
proven otherwise?''
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted Oct. 21 in New York on
criminal racketeering charges accusing them of plundering their
homeland of more than $100 million and using it to buy artwork and
Manhattan real estate.
   Mrs. Marcos, 59, pleaded innocent Monday to the charges, but
Marcos, 71, remained in Honolulu. Defense lawyers claimed Marcos was
too frail to make the trip.
   An aide said Marcos was upset by the media's treatment of Mrs.
Marcos.
   In protesting his innocence, Marcos presented the results of old
investigations, which he said cleared him of allegations of
wrongdoing.
   ``We reiterate that these matters are of record and have been the
subject of numerous discussions years ago and have been included in
various pleadings in the United States and in the Philippines,'' he
said.
   ``We honestly believe that this should be given special
consideration by political observers, analysts and investigative
reporters who now specialize in depriving President Marcos of his
right to be presumed innocent unless proven otherwise,'' Marcos said.
   ``Where is the sense of justice and fairness when the present
media have already convicted President Marcos of these charges in
utter and flagrant disregard of previous findings proving the
contrary?'' he said.
   Marcos said the U.S. General Accounting Office in 1986 cleared
him of allegations that he plundered his country or that he
illegally used U.S. military or humanitarian aid for his own
benefit. Before he was ousted, the Philippine parliment cleared him
of the same charges, he said.
   His successor, Corazon Aquino, said the parliment's investigation
was a whitewash controlled by Marcos.
   Marcos said the Federal Elections Commission twice ruled there
was no evidence he illegally contributed money to American political
candidates, allegations a U.S. congressional subcommittee is
reportedly investigating.

   A judge on Wednesday ordered individual
trials for 14 black legislators charged with trespassing during an
attempt to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state Capitol.
   Montgomery County District Judge Craig Miller made the decision
in response to a request by the prosecution.
   Prosecutors presented 2{ hours of testimony against the first
defendant, State Rep. Thomas Reed, and Miller rejected a defense
request to throw out the case.
   Then he indefinitely recessed the non-jury case, citing his
crowded docket and scheduling conflicts affecting witnesses and the
prominent civil rights lawyers who have traveled to Montgomery
without pay to represent Reed.
   Ernestine Sapp of Tuskegee, a defense attorney, predicted Reed's
trial might resume ``after the first of the year.'' She said the
indefinite delay ``gives time to settle the case'' by dismissing the
charges.
   Assistant District Attorney David Glanzer said he remained ready
to proceed at any time.
   The legislators were charged with criminal trespassing for
grabbing a fence around the Capitol, which is closed for renovation,
on Feb. 2 during a demonstration decrying the Confederate flag as a
symbol of racism. The charge carries a penalty of up to three months
in jail and a $500 fine.
   During opening arguments, Glanzer said police repeatedly warned
the legislators they would be arrested if they touched the fence,
and that putting one's fingers through a fence constitutes
trespassing under Alabama law.
   The defense argued that no crime occurred because the legislators
never entered the Capitol grounds.
   ``Now we go to the ridiculous _ whether someone's fingers went
through the fence. That's ridiculous even for Alabama,'' defense
attorney J.L. Chestnut of Selma said.
   Reed, 60, the senior black in the Alabama Legislature, went on
trial first because ``Tom was nominally in charge'' of the protest
and was arrested first, Chestnut said.
   Reed was convicted Sept. 30 on federal extortion charges, and a
court has ordered his removal from office upon his sentencing. He
claims the extortion case was built against him because of his
threat to physically pull down the Confederate flag from atop the
Capitol if the Republican governor failed to do it before the
opening day of the 1988 legislative session.
   Gov. Guy Hunt says he views the flag as a historic emblem and
refuses to remove it unless the Legislature votes to do so. A
resolution to remove the flag failed to win passage in the House on
Feb. 2.
   State Capitol Police Chief Cecil Humphrey testified that two or
three days before the demonstration, Hunt's legal adviser, Mark
Montiel, made the decision to charge Reed and other black
legislators with trespassing if they tried to enter the fenced
Capitol grounds.

   An unseasonal snow storm caused central
Sweden's worst power blackout in 20 years Wednesday, the national
news agency TT said.
   At least three persons were killed in accidents on icy roads.
   The power outage affected more than 50,000 households in a wide
area north and west of Stockholm, TT said. Some homes were without
power 20 hours later.
   Trains from north Sweden were delayed up to 10 hours after the
storm's winds of up to 90 mph knocked trees across power lines and
railroad tracks, Swedish television reported.
   An Italian truck driver lost control of his vehicle and caused a
pileup of four passenger cars and three longhaul trucks on a major
highway in Ostergotland province, newspaper reports said Wednesday.
The driver suffered a slight injury but no one else was reported
hurt.

   A woman accused of helping to lure a
businessman from his home and burying him alive in a botched ransom
attempt was found guilty Wednesday on murder and kidnapping charges.
   Nancy Rish, 26, was convicted in the death of businessman Stephen
Small after a Winnebago County jury deliberated for an hour and 40
minutes.
   ``This jury's verdict was swift and just,'' said prosecutor
Michael Ficaro. Small, 40, member of a prominent media family and
great-grandson of the late Illinois Gov. Len Small, was lured from
his home by kidnapers who placed him in a homemade box and buried it
in sandy soil on Sept. 2, 1987.
   Telephone calls were made to Small's wife, Nancy, seeking a
ransom, but she was unable to decipher instructions for a drop-off
and no ransom was ever offered. Small suffocated when a makeshift
air supply system failed.
   Ms. Rish's live-in boyfriend Daniel Edwards was convicted of
Small's murder and kidnapping in May and sentenced to death.
Prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty for Ms. Rish.
   Kankakee County Circuit Judge John Michela set her sentencing for
Dec. 6.
   The jury, which was sequestered, was selected in Rockford because
of extensive publicity in the Kankakee area.
   Ficaro had argued that Ms. Rish and Edwards believed the
abduction would lead to a $1 million ransom and ``that ticket to
easy street ... life in the fast lane.''
   He called Ms. Rish a ``gold digger'' who lured Small from his
home so Edwards could bury him alive as part of a plot to collect
the ransom.
   Ms. Rish's attorneys maintained that she was the victim of
mistaken identity and that Edwards had been with another blond
person when the crimes were committed.
   Ms. Rish took the stand on her own behalf near the end of the
trial, acknowledging she took Edwards to various sites significant
to the crimes but saying she did not know what Edwards was doing.

chief, and attorney James Dunbar of Columbia, S.C., with one count
of conspiracy and 22 counts of making false representations to the
INS to obtain benefits for aliens.
   Richard and Dunbar pleaded innocent at an arraignment Wednesday
in Atlanta federal court. Richard was released on a $10,000 bond and
Dunbar on a $20,000 bond, said U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr Jr.
   A person answering the telephone at Richard's Doraville home said
Richard would not comment. Repeated calls were made to Dunbar's home
Wednesday night, but his telephone was busy.
   ``The offenses basically relate to efforts by aliens to be
admitted to the country or to remain here in the country, under
certain exceptions in INS regulations,'' Barr said. ``Were it not
for the false representations brought by Dunbar, they would not
remain in the United States.''
   Barr said the indictment charges that Dunbar would bring the
false information to Richard, who would in turn approve the benefits
for the aliens even though he knew the information wasn't true.
   Richard was transferred from Atlanta to Washington during the
investigation and retired four months ago, Barr said.
   The prosecutor said both Dunbar and Richard each face up to 115
years in prison and $3.65 million in fines if convicted on all
charges.

   Two teen-agers were sentenced to at least 50
years in prison Wednesday for murdering two Roman Catholic priests
in their rectories.
   The trial judge, state Supreme Court Justice Frederick Marshall,
sentenced the pair to the maximum term, and said he wished he could
have imposed the death penalty, which was abolished in New York in
1965.
   Marshall told defendents Theodore Simmons, 19, and Milton Jones,
18, the sentence was meant to ``voice the outrage and disgust of the
community.''
   The two were convicted in separate trials of robbing, torturing
and murdering the Rev. A. Joseph Bissonette, 55, in St.
Bartholomew's Church on Feb. 24, 1987 and Monsignor David Herlihy,
74, in St. Matthew's church on March, 7, 1987.
   The crimes sent shock waves through the city, and terrorized
churchmen.
   A clergyman from the poor neigborhood where the slayings occurred
testified that he slept with a ceremonial sword at his bedside
because he feared the tough youths who came to his rectory late at
night looking for handouts.
   The defense for both Simmons and Jones claimed that the youths'
underprivileged upbringing contributed to the crimes.
   The judge rejected the argument and said the pair ``stripped them
(the priests) of all human dignity.''
   In his final statement, Simmons, who tried to blame Jones for the
killings, said, ``I did not kill anyone ... everything exploded in
my face and I did not know what to do.''
   Jones said through his attorney he was sorry for the crimes.
   ``Something happened that he got caught up in and just did not
known how to extricate himself,'' Jones' attorney Jeffrey Sellers
told the judge.
   Relatives of the two slain priests said they were struck by a
lack of emotion from the defendants.
   Nan Gallivan, Monsignor Herlihy's niece, said the defendants did
not appear remorseful at any time during the trial.
   Raymond Bissonette, brother of the Rev. Bissonette, said the
prison terms were ``something that had to be done.''
   Marshall sentenced Simmons and Jones to two consecutive 25
years-to-life terms, which means the pair will not be eligible for
parole until they have served 48{ years, counting the time they
already have been held.

   Navy Secretary William L. Ball III, reversing
the decision of several predecessors, has authorized an attempt to
recover the remains of nine aviators who died in a plane crash 40
years ago in a remote part of Canada.
   Cmdr. Jeff Zakem, a spokesman, said Wednesday that Ball ``had
reviewed the complete file and granted approval for a recovery
mission, to be attempted sometime next summer'' in a mountainous
section of Vancouver Island, Canada.
   Zakem said he had no further explanation for Ball's decision to
authorize the expedition.
   But Raymond H. Swentek, who has led a one-man campaign for 20
years to recover the remains of his brother and the other eight
fliers, credited personal appeals to various senators and to the
office of Vice President George Bush for convincing Ball to review
the matter.
   Two years ago, in October 1986, then Navy Secretary John F.
Lehman rejected a recovery operation as unjustified even though the
Naval Medical Command had sided with Swentek and recommended
approval.
   ``I'm floating on the clouds right now,'' Swentek said late
Wednesday. ``I can't believe it's finally going to happen.''
   Swentek, a Washington resident and freelance consultant, has been
jousting with the Navy to recover the remains of nine men who died
on Nov. 4, 1948, when their P2V Neptune, a World War II-era bomber,
crashed on Vancouver Island.
   Among the nine was Lt.j.g. Edward T. Swentek, and Raymond Swentek
has long argued the Navy at least owes the victims' families a
proper military burial for their loved ones.
   ``They were out there to provide for our security and we should
honor them properly,'' he says. ``And we want to bring our grief to
an end.''
   Until 1986, the Navy's response to Swentek's campaign had been
unequivocal, namely _ the site was so inaccessible and the terrain
so rugged that any recovery attempt would run the risk of injury to
the men sent in.
   The plane crashed into the side of a dead volcano in the Canadian
wilds in an area that is covered by snow virtually year-round. The
wreckage was not even discovered until 1961, and then only by
accident.
   The Navy also maintained it honored the victims properly when a
search party in 1962 made it to the area, recovered a small number
of bones and buried them at the site under concrete after erecting a
plaque.
   None of those arguments satisfied Swentek, who traveled to the
site himself in 1985 to explore the area, in the process recovering
some small skeletal remains himself. That was enough to convince the
Naval Medical Command to back Swentek.
   But when Lehman studied the matter, he vetoed an expedition,
saying at the time he didn't believe ``recovery of any significant
remains is likely.''
   After that setback, Swentek set up a tax-exempt trust to solicit
donations for a private expedition, but was never able to raise
enough money.
   In a 1986 interview with The Associated Press, however, he also
vowed to keep fighting the Navy.
   ``I'm sure the Navy wants to do the right thing,'' said Swentek,
himself a former naval aviator. ``It's just a matter of getting them
off dead center. I'm not giving up on this.''

   Police commandos stormed a
prison where inmates had held three hostages for 45 hours, and an
official said three prisoners and a hostage were killed in the raid
Wednesday.
   The assault ended a standoff that began Monday night, when three
inmates jumped two guards and took their rifles at the prison in
Quezaltepeque, 15 miles north of San Salvador.
   The inmates, along with three others, demanded political asylum
in Mexico in exchange for releasing the hostages, a nurse and two
prison guards.
   The Mexican Embassy denied the asylum request on grounds the
prisoners had been jailed for common crimes, Justice Minister Julio
Alfredo Samayoa said.
   One of the inmates, identified as former National Guard officer
Edgardo Leiva Lainez, threatened to amputate the hostages' arms and
legs if the asylum demands were not met.
   Communications Minister Roberto Viera told reporters Wednesday
that about 100 prisoners not involved in the hostage-taking tried to
flee the prison, which was surrounded by army troops.
   The attempted escape provoked the six hostage-takers, who threw a
grenade and began shooting at the troops and fleeing prisoners,
Viera said.
   ``When the rioters began firing, the special forces intervened,''
Viera said.
   He said officials sent in 30 Treasury Police commandos after
deciding that ``dialogue was impossible because of the intransigent
attitude of the rioters.''
   Reporters at the site saw the commandos blow open the doors of
prison cells with charges and toss tear gas grenades inside to force
the prisoners out.
   Viera said Leiva, two other prisoners and one of the prison
guards held hostage were killed. The guard already had been wounded
in Monday night's takeover, he said.
   The nurse and the other guard were freed unharmed, while a
prisoner not involved in the hostage-taking was slightly wounded,
Viera said.
   Col. Miguel Vasconcelos, commander of the army brigade that
surrounded the prison, said another guard and a policeman were
seriously wounded when they tried to approach the inmates Monday
night.
   Victor Amaya Fuentes, assistant director of prisons, said the six
inmates involved in the takeover had been jailed on homicide and
assault charges.
   The nurse, Candida Francisca Figueroa, told reporters after her
release that ``I told them it wasn't correct what they were doing,
but they said they would leave (the prison) either alive or dead.''

<TEXT>
   About 100 Brown University students, some
hugging friends who sobbed, gathered Wednesday to protest two recent
rapes near campus and tell their own horror stories of sexual
violence.
   Police said both rape victims were attacked near the Ivy League
campus within two weeks of each other last month. The assaults
spurred appeals to female students to take the campus shuttle or
walk in groups.
   Providence police and Brown security officials say they believe
the same man may have been invovled in both rapes, since both women
were attacked at knifepoint as they were walking alone at night.
   They have declined to elaborate on the similarities and will only
say their investigation is continuing.
   Police have passed around flyers warning women of the attacks and
giving them tips on how to protect themselves.
   About 25 people spoke at the demonstration, including some who
talked about being raped by family members, brothers of friends,
friends of the family and others.
   Most speakers criticized what they described as a society of men
who think when a woman smiles at them, she wants sex, and family
members who blame women for incest and date rapes.
   They said they were also tired of not being able to walk where
they want and wear what they want.
   ``I'm not going to say I can't ... because that's like having
something stripped away from me,'' said Beth Bird, a senior, who
said she wants women students to form a ``counter-terrorist'' group
to fight back against men who try to assault them.
   Kathy Hathaway, a Brown senior and organizer of the speak-out,
said she and some classmates taking the campus shuttle at night are
angry their freedom is restricted.
   ``I resent the fact of feeling powerless,'' she said. ``When I
walk out of the library at night, there's a dilemma. It's not an
automatic decision to take the shuttle.''
   Hathaway said the speak-out was held to allow people to air their
feelings.
   ``On campus and in the Providence community as a whole, there's
been so much emotion ... but no forum to release the emotion,''
Hathaway said. ``We wanted to provide that arena.''
   The speak-out was to be followed by a 30-minute ``Take Back the
Night'' all-women march near the scene of the two rapes and a
candlelight vigil on the campus green. Men would be allowed to
participate in the vigil, she said.

   More Britons condemn homosexuality and favor
stricter morals, possibly in reaction to the spread of AIDS, an
independent research group said Thursday.
   The findings were part of a survey of 2,847 Britons conducted in
1987 by the independent Social and Community Planning Research
group, which has published reports on social attitudes annually
since 1983.
   ``Although we cannot be absolutely sure, it seems certain that
there is a link between stricter morals and concern over the spread
of AIDS,'' said Sharon Witherspoon, a senior researcher and joint
editor of the report.
   ``Our analysis shows that the type of person who tends to be less
sympathetic and more censorious toward AIDS sufferers is exactly the
same person who will be less liberal in their views on general
matters of sexual morality.''.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is most often spread through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. AIDS
is fatal, with no known cure.
   The British survey found 74 percent of those polled thought
homosexual relations were always or generally wrong, 12 percent more
than in 1983.
   The number of those surveyed who thought sex before marriage was
wrong rose from 23 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 1987. Those who
disapproved of extramarital affairs rose from 83 percent in 1983 to
88 percent last year.
   Reseachers found ambivalent attitudes on AIDS. Although 57
percent of respondents felt that ``most people with AIDS have only
themselves to blame,'' about 60 percent believed that ``people who
have AIDS get much less sympathy from society than they ought to
get.''
   One-third of the respondents agreed more money should be spent on
research into a cure for AIDS, but less than 10 percent thought more
should be spent on care for AIDS victims.
   That finding indicated ``a somewhat chilling lack of strong
concern for increasing the resources available for helping
sufferers,'' said Lindsay Brook, a senior researcher and co-editor
of the book.
   The survey found that 60 percent of those polled believed
teen-agers under 16 should not be given contraceptives, 10 percent
more than in 1983.
   The authors said the survey was carried out on a random sample of
people living in all areas of Britain except Northern Ireland.
Interviews were conducted at respondents' homes.

<HEAD>Hispanic FBI Agents Claim Retaliation for Successful Discrimination
Suit</HEAD>

   A lawyer said Wednesday the FBI has been
retaliating against Hispanic agents who successfully sued the bureau
in a racial discrimination case.
   About 25 of the 311 agents who joined the suit report being
harassed and retaliated against since U.S. District Judge Lucius
Bunton ruled Sept. 30 that the FBI had discriminated against
Hispanic agents, said Orlando Quintana, an Albuquerque lawyer
affiliated with the plaintiffs' legal team.
   Quintana on Wednesday was putting together a 50-page affidavit to
be filed Thursday in Bunton's court, detailing the stories of five
Hispanic agents who contend they have been retaliated against for
participating in the lawsuit or commenting about it.
   Spokesmen in the four FBI offices named in the affidavit did not
immediately return phone calls Wednesday to The Associated Press.
   After the two-week non-jury trial ended Aug. 26, Bunton
admonished the FBI not to punish any agents for joining in the suit
or testifying on the plaintiffs' behalf.
   The judge noted that several agents had testified they feared
retaliation because, they said, the FBI's ``First Commandment'' is
to never embarrass the bureau.
   In his 95-page ruling, Bunton said the FBI had discriminated
against Hispanic agents by promoting them too slowly, assigning them
less-desirable jobs and giving them less recognition for their
successes. Damages will be decided later.
   The suit was filed by Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez, the No. 2 man in
the El Paso FBI office, in January 1987.
   In the affidavit to be filed Thursday, Perez complains of being
put under administrative inquiry for speaking with reporters after
Bunton's verdict was announced, Quintana said.
   Fernando Mata, an agent in the Miami field office, testifies in
the affidavit that he has been put under administrative inquiry,
ostensibly for breaching national security during his testimony,
Quintana said.
   Mata testified Aug. 16 that he had done some undercover work
involving an unidentified foreign country. He also testified he was
given the FBI's highest reward in 1983 for his foreign work.
   Albuquerque agent James Garay testifies in the affidavit that his
bureau car and weapon were taken away as retaliation for testifying,
Quintana said.
   The FBI ``said he was under medication and as a result he
couldn't perform properly,'' said Quintana, who added that Garay
denies any medication he receives interferes with his job
performance.
   Two Los Angeles agents, Paul Magallenez and Rudy Valadez, testify
in the affidavit that they have been put under administrative
inquiry for talking to a reporter for California magazine, Quintana
said. The agents are quoted in the article as saying the Los Angeles
FBI office is mismanaged.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis slammed Republicans
George Bush and Dan Quayle as sorry candidates to lead a war against
drugs, and warned drug-producing countries that ``if you're against
us, don't expect a dime of American foreign aid.''
   Unleashing some of his harshest campaign rhetoric yet, Dukakis
criticized the vice president for saying Tuesday he would not
necessarily halt aid to nations that refuse to cooperate with U.S.
anti-drug efforts.
   ``Mike Dukakis will, you can depend on that,'' the Democratic
presidential nominee told about 10,000 people at a rally in
Chicago's Daley Plaza.
   ``That's an important difference in this election and will make a
very important difference in the lives of our children and
grandchildren,'' he said.
   Dukakis drew thunderous applause when he declared:
   ``I'll work with other countries but I'll be damned if I will
allow those countries to send their poison into the United States of
America. Maybe (Bush) thinks there are other things more important
than the future of our children. ... I say you have to draw the line
somewhere.''
   Chicago was the second stop on a three-state campaign tour
Wednesday that began in Minneapolis, where Dukakis' wife, Kitty, is
hospitalized.
   Dukakis repeated the anti-drug message in Pittsburgh, where he
addressed a rally of several thousand people. He mocked Bush for
wanting to be a ``tough guy'' but failing to back up his words with
actions.
   ``You have to draw the line somewhere, and I draw that line at
the lives of our children,'' Dukakis said, again criticizing Bush's
statement Tuesday.
   Showing signs of fatigue, Dukakis mistakenly referred to former
Interior Secretary James Watt as a former secretary of state.
   Dukakis capped the day in Philadelphia, where he attended a
get-out-the-vote rally with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson introduced Dukakis and made frequent references to Bush's
line of ``Read my lips,'' saying that Bush was part of the Reagan
administrations repeated failures in civil rights.
   Jackson brought the crowd to its feet.
   ``When we watch your lips, you watch our hips while we march and
vote,'' he said.
   Dukakis drew his best response from the crowd when asked about
apartheid.
   ``Nelson Mandela is still in jail and Manuel Noriega is still
running Panama,'' he said. ``It's time that changed.''
   During the primary campaign, Dukakis said he would refuse to give
foreign aid to any country involved in producing or trafficking in
illict drugs unless they cooperated fully with the U.S. campaign to
stamp out the drug trade.
   The same policy is reflected in federal law, but Dukakis and
congressional Democrats have criticized President Reagan for
certifying Panama and other suspect countries as eligible for
foreign aid.
   Dukakis said he would offer money, protection and even U.S.
military assistance to countries that request help in the drug war.
   ``If you're against us, don't expect a dime of American foreign
aid,'' he said. ``If you think you can do to Mike Dukakis what
(Panamanian leader Manuel) Noriega did to George Bush, if you think
we're going to risk our children's lives by putting someone like Dan
Quayle in charge of the war against drugs, then you're in for a big
surprise on Jan. 20, 1989.''
   Mark Goodin, a Bush spokesman, accused Dukakis of distorting
Bush's views.
   ``The vice president would never hesitate to use aid as a lever
on the war on drugs,'' Goodin said. ``However, he rejects the
approach that is simplistic and dangerous of unilaterally cutting
off foreign aid as a remedy of first resort and in doing so
completely removing any leverage and control the United States has
with these countries.''
   Dukakis' sharp attack came as he struggled to narrow Bush's
double-digit lead in national polls in the final days of the
campaign. His campaign aides dispute the poll figures, saying their
internal data show a Bush lead of about seven percentage points.
   Advisers to the Massachusetts governor also say the race is
tightening in several large, pivotal states, including Illinois.
Dukakis suggested at the Chicago rally that next Tuesday's election
is still up for grabs because of a large bloc of undecided voters.
   Dukakis took issue with Bush's recent claim that Dukakis and
running mate Lloyd Bentsen were waging a divisive campaign.
   ``This is the same fellow who commended Ferdinand Marcos for his
commitment to democracy, the guy who called James Watt an excellent
secretary of the interior, the fellow who said Robert Bork was an
outstanding appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States,
the fellow who picked Dan Quayle to be vice president of the United
States,'' Dukakis said.
   His aides defended Dukakis in commenting on reports that
Massachusetts had overdrawn one of its bank accounts by as much as
$190 million because of lagging revenue collections, and that the
state pension fund had invested money in a pool involved in a
hostile takeover attempt against RJR Nabisco.
   Dukakis adviser Thomas Herman said the state's pension money,
which is routinely invested, had never been used in a hostile
takeover.
   He said the state ordered the pool administrators not to use
Massachusetts funds in the RJR Nabisco deal because Nabisco has ties
to South Africa and Massachusetts has a law prohibiting such
investments.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter on
Wednesday ridiculed a U.S. Southern Command report that Marine
sentries exchanged gunfire with unidentified intruders at a fuel
storage depot near an American air base.
   ``It's absolutely beyond reality that there was an armed
confrontation,'' Ritter said on national television.
   ``It seems unlikely that after two hours of shooting they weren't
able to find a trace of a person, or a man wounded, or a death, or a
trace of munitions in the area.''
   According to the command, sentries at Arraijan Tank Farm near
Howard Air Base traded shots with intruders on-and-off for almost
two hours Monday night. No one was hurt, the command said.
   The gunfire began when ``11 Marines in listening posts heard
movement, voices and visually confirmed the presence of armed
intruders in the jungle,'' the Southern Command said. It said the
incident was under investigation.
   Panama's Defense Forces are commanded by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, the country's de facto leader. Noriega is under criminal
indictment in the United States on drug trafficking charges. He
denies the charges.
   The Reagan administation unsuccessfully has sought Noreiga's
ouster through economic sanctions and negotiations.
   Sentries have reported several intrusions at U.S. military
facilities in Panama this year.
   On April 11, a Marine sentry was accidentally shot and killed by
fellow guards at the 807-acre tank farm as they investigated the
first reported intrusion.
   The fuel storage depot is in a hilly, jungle area about five
miles west of Panama City.
   The Southern Command, responsible for all U.S. military
operations in Latin America, reported four intrusions in April at
U.S. military installations in Panama by what one spokesman called
``highly trained professionals.''
   In July, American soldiers exchanged gunfire with unidentified
intruders on two occasions at Arraijan, the command said.
   Panama's military has said its troops were not involved in those
incidents and suggested that nervous U.S. sentries imagined
intruders.
   Ritter claimed the latest report ``is part of that campaign of
(U.S.) intimidation'' aimed at justifying an increased U.S. military
presence here.
   ``It would appear that the United States not only periodically
has elections but also dispenses absurdities with the same
regularity,'' he said.
   Referring to the U.S. presidential election, Ritter said: ``I
don't believe that one way or the other the situation with the
United States is going to improve.''

   Millions of Mexicans spent Wednesday at
cemeteries observing the Day of the Dead, listening to music and
taking gifts of flowers and food to deceased relatives who are said
to drop by for a visit.
   The small cemetery of Mixquic in southeastern Mexico City was
crowded with people cleaning and adorning family graves with the
traditional Cempasuchil flowers, a type of marigold.
   Anita Ramirez, 15, put flowers on the grave of brother Horacio,
who died 14 years ago.
   ``I came here to remember him even though I didn't know him
really when he was alive,'' she said. ``He was my brother.''
   She said her parents were among hundreds of vendors selling
everything from candy skulls to cardboard skeletons that dance when
you pull a string.
   The Day of the Dead, which follows All Souls' Day, dates to Aztec
times. It is a mix of beliefs that include the concepts that the
dead are never far away and that the line between life and death is
blurred.
   In the weeks leading up to the Day of the Dead, bakery shelves
carry bread in the shape of bones and sugar skulls with the names of
the dead and the living. Friends exchange poems that jokingly refer
to each other's funerals.
   Families make altars in their homes and adorn them with flowers
and the favorite foods of their dead relatives. The same is done at
cemeteries, where families wait to eat until they believe the dead
have had their fill.
   In recent years, however, many upper-class Mexicans adopted
Halloween garb and practices instead, including plastic masks and
pumpkins.
   Miguel Angel Munez, 24, was putting flowers on the grave of his
father, who died 14 years ago.
   ``We come here on this day to be with the people we love. They
say they come back this day and we can be with them,'' Munez said.
   The cemetery church, San Andres, had a Day of the Dead altar with
a picture of Jesus as centerpiece and offerings of fruit, bread,
candles _ even sugar skulls _ crowded on the altar.
   More residents of the pueblo of Mixquic, bearing candles, visited
the cemetery Tuesday night.
   Mariachis and musicians playing drums and clarinets strolled
through the cemetery Wednesday evening.
   Children played with balloons and wore painted cone hats in a
festive atmosphere as adults sat on the graves and quietly talked
among themselves.

   George Bush said Wednesday the next president should reflect the
hopes and dreams of voters and proudly proclaimed, ``I am that
man.'' Michael Dukakis urged supporters to ``keep pouring it on'' in
a drive for an Election Day upset.
   The Democratic underdog also ripped into Bush's record on the
drug war and said ``I'll be damned'' before giving foreign aid to
countries not helping the cause.
   Bush, the leader in all the polls, said there was a ``great
divide'' separating himself from Dukakis on many issues. He
proclaimed that his own election would mean a ``mainstream mandate''
for the next four years.
   GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, a foe of abortion,
said he had no quarrel with a medical procedure he described as
aimed at preventing conception after rape. Asked pointedly whether
he would expect a rape victim to bear a child that resulted from
such an attack, he said, ``Hopefully they would seek medical
attention immediately, and under normal medical procedure, life and
conception would not even begin.''
   The national candidates made their rounds six days before the
voting while all around them the pace of campaigning quickened.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole was going to three states
during the day in a bid to help endangered GOP candidates for
Congress. Sen. Edward Kennedy countered for the Democrats by
campaigning in Minnesota, where Hubert H. Humphrey III is a Senate
race underdog.
   Officials in both parties agree Democrats are likely to retain
control of both houses of Congress after next week's balloting,
although Republicans harbor hopes of winning enough close Senate
seats to reduce the current 54-46 Democratic advantage.
   Dukakis and his running mate Lloyd Bentsen both criticized
Quayle. Bentsen said Bush had shown ``real disdain, disregard for
our country'' by tapping the Indiana senator to join his ticket.
   Dukakis said putting Quayle in charge of the drug war would be
risky for America's kids.
   Bush defended his 41-year-old political partner, saying he had
``been through the fire and his head is up and his chin is up.''
   President Reagan campaigned in Wisconsin and Ohio, scoffing at
Dukakis' claims to being a Democrat in the Harry Truman mold. ``I'll
tell you one thing, if he's Harry Truman I'm Roger Rabbit,'' said
the Republican campaign surrogate-in-chief.
   John Howard in Owensboro, Ky., set up a sort of drive-through
poll at his Crickets Classy Car Wash, and said the results were
about even. Customers could drive into a bay named for the
presidential candidate of their choosing. ``It's very scientific,''
he said. ``The margin of error is 100 percent.''
   As usual, Dukakis' aides said their private polls were
encouraging. As usual, the public polls seemed to be pointing to a
Republican victory next Tuesday. ABC said its latest Illinois survey
was a dead heat, but Bush led in other surveys from Ohio, Arkansas
and Connecticut.
   Bush campaigned through Illinois and Michigan, two key Midwestern
battlegrounds.
   At his first stop, at Adlai Stevenson High School outside
Chicago, he instructed an audience made up largely of students how
to make an Election Day choice.
   ``You're not going to make your decision on some television
(advertisement) or some sound bite, and what I want you to do is
look beyond the charges, get past the shouting and choose as
president the person who represents your values, your dreams, your
hopes for the United States, and I am that man.''
   He returned to the theme later in Grand Rapids, Mich. ``I
represent the mainstream, the mainstream views and the mainstream
values. If I win, it will be a mainstream mandate. That's what this
election is all about,'' he said.
   Bush also said Dukakis was conducting a ``media blitz,''
appearing ``on every television show except `Wheel of Fortune.' He
was afraid that Vanna might turn over the L-word.''
   Dukakis began his day in Minnesota by visiting his wife Kitty,
who is hospitalized for an upper respiratory infection.
   At a downtown rally, the Massachusetts governor urged supporters
to ``keep pouring it on and pouring it on'' as he summoned up
memories of Harry Truman's upset victory of 1948, John Kennedy's
closely won contest of 1960 and Hubert Humphrey's narrow defeat in
1968.
   Later, in Chicago, he employed some of the harshest rhetoric of
the campaign against his rival. ``Maybe Bush thinks there are other
things more important than the future of our children,'' he said.
``I say you have to draw the line somewhere.'' He said to other
nations, ``Don't expect a dime'' in foreign aid without help on the
drug war.
   And at a get-out-the-vote rally in Philadelphia with Jesse
Jackson, Dukakis drew his best applause when answering a question
about apartheid: ``Nelson Mandela is still in jail and Manuel
Noriega is still running Panama. It's time that changed.''
   Despite Dukakis' campaign aggressiveness, aides spent part of the
day defending the governor from reports that Massachusetts has
overdrawn one of its bank accounts by as much as $190 million
because of lagging revenue collections and that its pension fund had
money invested in a pool that had been involved in a hostile attempt
to take over RJR Nabisco.
   Dukakis also aired new television commercials nationally that
originally were tailored for California. One says the Democrat wants
an ``America that exports its products, not its jobs.'' In another,
he says he wants ``clean air and clean water and clean coasts and a
clean government in Washington, D.C.''
   Quayle was asked the question about abortion while campaigning in
Memphis, Tenn. He said if a rape victim underwent a procedure known
as dilation and curettage immediately after being raped, he would
``not construe that as being an abortion.''
   Dr. Robert Shesser, an emergency care specialist at George
Washington University Medical Center in Washington, said the
procedure described by Quayle is not the standard post-rape medical
treatment. He said that once doctors determine that conception has
taken place, a woman is offered a ``morning after'' pill aimed at
ending pregnancy.

detail</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan exercised pocket vetoes
Wednesday on a bill designating 1.43 million acres of Forest Service
land in Montana as wilderness as well as on a measure establishing a
corporation to provide development capital to Indian businesses, the
White House announced.
   By exercising the pocket vetoes after Congress adjourned for the
year, there is no chance of overrides.
   In a statement concerning the Montana wilderness bill, Reagan
said, ``Enactment of the bill would injure the economy of Montana.
It could cost jobs and eliminate vast mineral development
opportunities. It also would reduce the flexibility the federal
government needs in managing the nation's natural heritage.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who co-sponsored the measure with
fellow Montana Democratic Sen. John Melcher, accused Reagan and Vice
President George Bush's presidential campaign of playing politics
with the bill.
   ``This is an affront to the people of Montana,'' Baucus said
Wednesday night in a statement read by press secretary Scott
Williams. ``This bill was vetoed for petty politics, and that's all.
... Clearly, the Bush campaign had a hand in this. The vice
president is still a member of the environmental wrecking crew.''
   The wilderness bill, passed by voice vote in both chambers of
Congress _ the Senate on Oct. 18 and the House on Oct. 20 _ would
have affected more than 6 million acres of Montana and was the
result of a compromise worked out among competing interests,
including conservationists and the timber and lumber industries.
   The measure designated about 1.43 million acres of Forest Service
land as wilderness; 360,400 acres as special management areas,
meaning recreation; and 320,700 acres as federal study areas. It
also released for non-wilderness uses _ such as timber harvesting
and mineral exploration _ another 4 million acres in Montana's 10
national forests.
   Reagan's veto was lauded by a northwest Montana logger, Bruce
Vincent, who called it ``a real victory for the citizens of Montana
and the families and communities who had a lot at stake.''
   Also supporting the veto was Conrad Burns, the Republican running
against Melcher for a Senate seat. Burns said the bill was vetoed
not for political reasons, but because it would cost jobs in Montana.
   ``If there were any politics involved in this, it was John
Melcher holding this bill up all year long and introducing it in the
11th hour, without holding hearings on it,'' Burns said in Montana.
   Melcher criticized Burns as the one playing politics, saying,
``We don't really need to make this political. We've had a hard
enough time passing a bill with all the competing interests in
Montana. To add another dimension with the White House ... well,
it's pretty tough.''
   Reagan said the administration's National Forest System Land and
Resource Management Plans for Montana already strike the appropriate
balance among competing economic, environmental and cultural
interests. The legislation, he said, ``would have severely disrupted
that balance.''
   In addition, the president said, the measure would have limited
the government's ability ``to obtain strategic and critical minerals
... necessary to supply military, industrial and essential civilian
needs during national defense emergencies....''
   Reagan argued that the federal government would have given up
revenue-producing land in favor of non-revenue-producing land, thus
increasing the federal deficit.
   The president said he was withholding his approval of the bill
creating the Indian Development Finance Corp. because it ``would
have created an expensive and unnecessary new bureaucracy and
duplicated currently existing programs.''
   The measure to provide development capital to Indian businesses
would not have addressed the underlying problems of economic
development for Indians, Reagan said, while placing ``the government
at risk of substantial financial loss.'' The bill ``does not provide
sufficient authority for government oversight of the financial
activities that could result in such loss.''
   Instead of creating a new institution, Reagan said, better use
should be made of existing sources of capital such as the Indian
Financing Act. He noted that he recently signed a bill which
increased the ceiling on loans and loan guarantees under that act.
   The section of the bill that transferred federal land in Southern
California to several bands of Southern California mission Indians
was unaffected by the pocket veto, Reagan said, because that also
was included in the omnibus Indian affairs bill that he approved
earlier.

   British citizen Bernard John Green was
convicted Wednesday on charges involving the sale of sensitive
technology to the Soviet Union that helped the Soviet navy muffle
its submarines.
   A Kongsberg city court told Green, however, it would refrain from
sentencing him for a trial period of two years, in effect putting
him on probation for that time.
   Green, a resident of Norway since 1975, was convicted for his
role in arranging the sale of the equipment in conjuction with
Toshiba Machines Co., a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics giant
Toshiba Corp.
   Green was a sales manager for the state-owned Kongsberg
Vaapenfabrikk arms factory when it negotiated with Toshiba and the
Soviets to sell machine tools for cutting submarine propellers.
Green was charged with falsifying information on an export license
application to hide the capability of the equipment, which was sold
to the Soviets from 1982 to 1985.
   Western trade regulations ban selling such machinery to Soviet
bloc nations as a rule.
   With the sophisticated machine tools, the Soviets developed a
propeller blade that was quieter and harder for Western sub hunters
to detect.
   The incident strained U.S.-Norwegian relations and Prime Minister
Gro Harlem Brundtland apologized publicly to President Reagan.

<HEAD>Jack Anderson TV Special Concludes JFK Victim Of Mob Conspiracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   John F. Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy involving an
alliance of American mobsters and the Cuban government, according to
a prime-time TV special Wednesday night hosted by investigative
columnist Jack Anderson.
   ``There was a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy and for the
last 25 years there has been a conspiracy to cover it up,'' Anderson
said on the live two-hour program that featured old film footage,
live interviews and ``dramatic re-enactments.''
   The syndicated program, ``American Expose: Who Murdered JFK,''
was based largely on previously disclosed theories and reports
linking the Nov. 22, 1963, slaying with the American mob and Cuban
government.
   In the 25 years since the assassination, scores of books,
articles and TV programs have produced a wide range of conspiracy
theories that point the finger alternately at organized crime, the
CIA and Cuba.
   The Warren Commission, appointed by Lyndon Johnson after the
assassination, concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the
slaying. The House Select Committee on Assassinations later
concluded that Kennedy probably was the victim of a conspiracy and
that there was a second gunman who fired at Kennedy.
   Anderson's theory is based on interviews he conducted with Johnny
Roselli, a Las Vegas crime boss and top lieutenant to the late
Chicago mob chieftain Sam Giancana.
   Roselli, who was cooperating with a Senate investigators when he
was killed in 1976, told Anderson and others that he learned of the
alleged conspiracy through mob sources.
   Anderson believes Cuban leader Fidel Castro wanted to kill
Kennedy after learning of alleged CIA plots to kill Castro. And La
Cosa Nostra leaders in the United States wanted the president dead
because of his administration's crusade against the mob led by his
brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.
   Anderson said reputed Miami mob chief Santos Trafficante, alleged
New Orleans mob boss Carlos Marcello and Teamsters chief Jimmy Hoffa
all had ``motive and means to kill the president.''
   And he reiterated reports linking both Oswald and his assassin,
Jack Ruby, to organized crime. Oswald, a pro-Castro activist, was
recruited by Cuba to kill JFK and Ruby was recruited by mobsters to
kill Oswald, according to Anderson. The columnist also asserted that
Ruby and Oswald met in the weeks prior to the assassination.
   The program also presented a private company's computer
enhancement of photographs of Kennedy, concluding that the shot that
killed him was fired from the front. Oswald was positioned behind
the presidential motorcade in a sixth floor room of the nearby Texas
School Book Depository.
   In a bizarre allegation, Anderson said the same photo analysts
also concluded that a picture of three hobos near the shooting scene
taken shortly after the killing appear to show Watergate conspirator
E. Howard Hunt and James Earl Ray, the killer of Martin Luther King
Jr. Hunt denied that charge on the show. Anderson gave no
explanation of their alleged connection.
   The program also featured live interviews with Marina Oswald
Porter, Oswald's who testified before the Warren Commission. She
said she felt manipulated by the commission ``to make Lee a guilty
party. ... I was very young and immature and naive.''
   Anderson also charged that Johnson covered up the conspircy,
fearing public disclosure of the alleged CIA plots to kill Castro
would provoke a world war with the Soviet Union. He provided no
evidence to back up that claim.

   The arrival of at least two new Soviet missiles
in Kabul has raised U.S. concern about Pakistan's security and
whether there will be a delay in the second stage of the Red Army's
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The SS-1 Scud rockets were displayed in the Afghan capital after
Undersecretary of State Michael H. Armacost complained to Soviet
Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin on Monday about sending long-range TU26
Backfire bombers into combat there for the first time.
   The Soviets are backing the Afghan government against U.S.-armed
rebels in a war that has raged for nearly nine years. On Aug. 15,
the Soviets completed the pullout of more than half the 100,000
troops that had fought alongside the pro-Moscow government.
   The remaining troops must depart by Feb. 15 under an agreement
signed in Geneva last spring. The Soviets hinted recently that the
second stage would begin Nov. 15. But a U.S. official, who spoke
Tuesday on condition of anonymity, said that might be delayed.

   Political pollsters have plied their trade in
stormy weather in the presidential election's final weeks, buffeted
by complaints that their work is distorting the campaign and
alienating voters.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis has led the criticism _ not
surprisingly, for he's trailed George Bush in the polls. But
Republicans also have questioned the effect on the race of the
emphasis on poll results.
   ``The question is whether these polls are giving the impression
to the American people that their vote doesn't matter,'' Frank J.
Fahrenkopf Jr., the Republican Party chairman, said Tuesday. ``There
is that danger.''
   The public, as well, is down on the polls. In recent Gallup
surveys, 45 percent said reporting who's ahead in polls is bad for
the country. As many said polls do not improve press coverage of the
election. And even more said polls should not be reported in the
final weeks of a presidential campaign.

might make some Dukakis boosters happy the torch hasn't yet been
passed to a new generation.
   High school students nationwide Tuesday chose Vice President Bush
for president by a 2-1 margin, prompting observations that the tally
is a clear signal the Old Guard has overtaken the New Frontier among
the nation's youth.
   ``One person put it rather succinctly: The young people have
grown up under the Reagan administration and they are rather
complacent,'' said Kim Robert Nilsen, a spokesman for the Northfield
Mount Hermon School.
   ``Issues do not tend to surface and be debated in any great
fashion,'' Nilsen said. ``With no burning issues, there's probably
no real reason to contemplate going in another direction.''

   The Chinese government is applying the brakes to

   Inflation is 20 percent, even by conservative official estimates.
Money supply is up an astonishing 40 percent. Local governments,
ignoring austerity orders from Beijing, are throwing money at new
projects and contributing to an unsustainable industrial growth rate
of 20 percent.
   Corruption is rife, particularly among local officials taking
advantage of a two-tiered pricing system to obtain hard-to-get

   Vitamin E can ease a serious side effect of
schizophrenia medication and team up with vitamin C to help slow the
course of Parkinson's disease, which afflicts at least 350,000
Americans, two studies suggest.
   In both cases, it appeared to work by helping protect the brain
against damage from chemical entities called free radicals, which
are produced by the body, said the researchers, who described their
studies Tuesday at a conference on vitamin E, sponsored by the New
York Academy of Sciences.
   Jean Lud Cadet of the Columbia University College of Physicians
and Surgeons in New York said vitamin E appeared to reduce symptoms
of tardive dyskinesia, which appears in 20 percent to 30 percent of
people taking antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia or some
other illnesses.
   The condition produces jerky movements of the facial muscles and
slow writhing movements of the limbs and sometimes the trunk.

<HEAD>Turner Network Series Looks at Hollywood and Movies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Western put Hollywood into the movie
business and kept it there, consistently pulling audiences into
theaters over the decades.
   It's therefore fitting that ``The Story of Hollywood,'' a new
series starting Saturday on Turner Network Television, opens with
homage to Western and gangster films.
   Future episodes will look at war movies, B movies, blockbusters,
the coming of sound, Hollywood and sex, the communist scare of the
1950s, ``the dream factory'' and Hollywood today.
   In 1903, only two years after the real event, ``The Great Train
Robbery'' celebrated Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in a
12-minute movie, the longest motion picture ever. In 1969, ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' starring Paul Newman and Robert
Redford, enhanced the legend and won four Oscars.
   It was another Western, ``The Squaw Man'' in 1914, that settled
the movie industry in Hollywood. The Cecil B. de Mille feature not
only brought other filmmakers west but for the first time also gave
the Western a seriousness beyond the Saturday morning shoot 'em ups.
   Burt Reynolds is host of the Hollywood history series, which was
produced by the British Broadcasting Co. in association with TNT.
   TNT is the new cable network started by entrepreneur Ted Turner
to showcase the huge library of MGM movies he owns, plus original
movies and specials made for the network.
   If some of the movie titles seem unfamiliar, it's because BBC has
used the English titles. ``Ride the High Country,'' for instance, is
called ``Guns in the Afternoon.''
   The series will unfold over five consecutive Saturdays, with each
episode divided into two one-hour parts. This Saturday, the story of
the Western is followed by one on gangster films.
   It's an affectionate, largely uncritical survey. It offers more
old footage than insight, but whether you're a movie buff or just a
casual viewer, it's worth a look. It includes a lot of historical
film, plus generous clips from movies and interviews with
moviemakers.
   Director Richard Brooks, for instance, explains how gangster
films evolved from melodramas to dramas. ``The difference,'' he
explains, ``is that if you point a gun at someone and it misfires,
that's melodrama. If you point a gun at somebody then can't pull the
trigger, that's drama.''
   The first all-talking picture was ``Lights of New York'' in 1928,
in which a chorus girl became involved with gangsters. The reviews
called it ``primitive'' and ``crude,'' but it has historical
relevance.
   Gangster films, which cast such stars as Edward G. Robinson,
James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart as anti-heroes, were a reflection
of ``the cynicism and desperation'' of the Depression era of the
1930s, the series says. Later, with the repeal of Prohibition, the
G-man became the new hero.
   Movies like ``The Naked City'' in 1948 brought realism to crime
films, while ``Bonnie and Clyde'' was the first anti-establishment
crime movie and ``The Godfather'' used the world of crime as a
metaphor for American life.
   Hollywood, fearing the loss of its European market, held off
supporting the Allies in World War II until Pearl Harbor.
Thereafter, the film industry threw itself wholeheartedly into
support of the Allied cause. Movies backed the war effort at the
front, at sea, in the air, behind enemy lines, and at the home front.
   The series also looks at the rise of the director as the dominant
figure in filmmaking, the crumbling of the big studios, the
communist scare of the 1950s, the new generation of school-trained
moviemakers and the soaring costs of making feature films.
   From the beginning, Hollywood battled the censors. Sex attracted
audiences, but it also attracted moralists determined to keep sex
out of the movies. A 1903 epic called ``Dolorita's Passion Dance''
was the first movie to come under attack by the censors.
   Mae West's ribald comedies are credited with saving Paramount
from bankruptcy, but they also inspired formation of the Roman
Catholic Church's League of Decency. The studios were forced to set
up their own system of self-censorship through the Production Code.
The industry adopted more lenient movie ratings with a new age of
permissiveness in the late 1960s.

<HEAD>With a Little Luck, Big Takeovers Can Boost Small Portfolios</HEAD>

   A tiny investment club in the Midwest _
appropriately named ``ESP'' _ expects to see its stock portfolio
expand by about 13 percent as a result of Philip Morris Cos.'
mammoth $13 billion takeover of Kraft Inc.
   The group, which consists mostly of retired couples from
Columbus, Ohio, bought a block of Kraft stock three years ago for
around $36 a share, when the company was still known as Dart &
Kraft, explained member LaVonne Raney.
   But contrary to what its name might imply, none of ESP's members
could have sensed Philip Morris would be snapping up those shares
now for $106 apiece in cash, giving the club about $7,000 in
``winnings,'' as Mrs. Raney puts it.
   ``It's a little bit like the lottery ... if you want to be
cynical about the whole thing. A few lucky people are winning, the
rest aren't,'' said Larry Biehl, co-founder and director of Bailard
Biehl & Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., investment advisory firm.
   Biehl and many others in his field say that while their clients
are envious of the potential windfall awaitikcPqt

   and other recent giant takeover targets, such as RJR Nabisco Inc. or
Pillsbury Inc., there's no big rush to play Wall Street's takeover
game.
   They term most individual investors in America as long-term
planners, who might be saving for retirement or their childrens'
college education. That's opposed to those who might dash off to
their discount brokers minutes after reading of a takeover battle or
getting a ``tip.''
   ``The planning client is an entirely different animal than the
transaction-oriented client,'' explained Hank Madden, a financial
planner in IDS Financial Services Inc.'s Jacksonville, Fla., office.
   ``The planning client strategically moves. They do not get caught
up in the turmoil of the daily tactical moves of the market.
Transactionary (clients) will deal with a reactionary perspective.''
   Tim Lucum, a retired Seattle pharmacist who belongs to an
investment club similar to ESP, puts himself mainly in the first
category. He says his group, which calls itself the Deadenders,
won't be trying to guess where the next big takeover will take
place, but rather looks for what it considers to be undervalued or
recession-proof stock.
   ``We have a stock selection guide,'' Lucum explained. ``We are
looking at what the company has done in the past 10 years. If we
think a stock will double in about five years, we'll buy it.''
   Lucum said his club made a special exception in buying Gillette
Co. stock, when the personal care giant was involved in a battle
over control of its board of directors. The proxy fight pressured
the stock higher, but even so, Lucum thought the shares were a good,
long-term value.
   Jay Goldinger, who runs the Beverly Hills, Calif., investment
firm Capital Insight Inc., says the latest takeover craze _ which
includes a $20 billion bid for RJR Nabisco from Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. and a $5.23 billion bid for Pillsbury from Grand
Metropolitan PLC _ may not be affecting individual investors so much
because many have bought into stock or bond mutual funds.
   ``The individual goes into a mutual fund these days and doesn't
tend to react. It's mostly institutional investors that are
involved,'' he said.
   Madden agreed, adding, ``I think the average investor is very
ill-informed. They look at what's happening with Kraft and say how
is that going to affect me. `I'm not going to get a discount on
cheese.'''
   On the other hand, institutional investors, which include many
large pension funds and insurance companies, are far more
sophisticated and tend to buy and sell large blocks of stock.
   Still, Biehl says the takeover frenzy is reviving excitement in
the stock market after several months in the doldrums.
   ``It puts the market back on the front page,'' he said. ``People
were looking at the market after the Oct. 19 (1987) crash as being
something like boxing. They suspect it's fixed.
   ``What we're seeing lately is some heavyweight matches.''

   Here is a brief look at some of the hottest Senate and House
races on the Nov. 8 ballot:
   
   SENATE
   
   CONNECTICUT _ Sen. Lowell Weicker, the Senate's most liberal
Republican, had his hands full trying to maintain his perennial
political balancing act against a challenge from Democratic state
Attorney General Joseph Lieberman. Polls show the two in a dead
heat. Lieberman was scoring well with appeals to environmental and
``family'' issues, and charges that Weicker ignores the state to
fight Quixotic civil liberties battles.
   FLORIDA _ Late polls showed Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay held a
narrow edge over his GOP opponent, Rep. Connie Mack, in their battle
over the seat of retiring Democrat Lawton Chiles. MacKay, a folksy
campaigner, has traveled the state with a populist message and harsh
criticism for his rival for votes against federal environmental,
child nutrition and elderly care programs. Mack has sought to
portray MacKay as a liberal outside the state's mainstream.
   MINNESOTA _ In a race dominated by negative advertising, GOP Sen.
David Durenberger, once viewed as vulnerable, maintained a lead in
the polls going into the final week against Democratic challenger
Hubert H. Humphrey III, the state attorney general. Durenberger
seemed to live down problems that included marital difficulties and
disclosure of national security secrets to a Jewish group. Humphrey,
a lackluster campaigner, suffered by comparison to his father, the
late vice president.
   MISSISSIPPI _ One of the GOP's best hopes for picking off a
Democratic Senate seat and recouping on 1986 losses in the South
lies in Rep. Trent Lott, the party's No. 2 leadership official in
the House. His well-organized and amply-funded campaign had pulled
to an eight-point lead over three-term Democratic Rep. Wayne Dowdy
by mid October, but was bothered by news reports about benefits for
the state for which Lott claimed credit, but was shown to have
previously opposed. Dowdy hoped to combine overwhelming black
support with votes from rural whites for a come-from-behind win.
   NEBRASKA _ Former Democratic Gov. Robert Kerrey is the clear
favorite to knock off incumbent Republican Sen. David Karnes, who
was appointed to his Senate seat to fill a vacancy in 1987. Karnes
rebounded from large poll deficits after winning a bruising GOP
primary, but lost momentum after commenting ``we need fewer
farmers'' during a debate.
   NEVADA _ This up-and-down race promises a close finish. Incumbent
Republican Sen. Chic Hecht, whose fumbling style made him the most
vulnerable incumbent, has fought back hard and closed the gap with
Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan. Hecht has been hurt by his failure to
head off using Nevada as the site for a nuclear waste repository;
Bryan ran into criticism over purchase of an expensive executive jet
for the state.
   NEW JERSEY _ The most slashing negative attacks in any major race
this year have accompanied the battle between incumbent Democrat
Frank Lautenberg and GOP challenger Pete Dawkins. Dawkins, a Rhodes
scholar, former football star and Army general, has called his
opponent a scheming profiteer; Lautenberg, a self-made millionaire
businessman, has tagged Dawkins a carpetbagger and a liar.
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Mike Lowry, an unabashed liberal Democrat, is
battling conservative former Sen. Slade Gorton, for the seat of
retiring GOP Sen. Daniel Evans. The race hinged largely on images _
Lowry trying to tone down his scruffy, arm-waving persona and Gorton
apologizing for the aloofness that contributed to his 1986
re-election defeat.
   WISCONSIN _ A late spurt by state Senate Republican leader Susan
Engeleiter appeared to be falling short of catching Democratic
millionaire businessman Herbert Kohl, a political novice who bought
his way into public prominence with millions of dollars in TV
advertising. They are seeking the seat of retiring Democrat William
Proxmire.
   
   HOUSE
   
   CALIFORNIA 19TH: Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, a seven-term
Republican, faces a spirited challenge from Democratic state Sen.
Gary K. Hart in what seems to be the most expensive House race in
the country, with both candidates expected to spend about $1.2
million. Lagomarsino is a strong supporter of the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels and Star Wars, both of which Hart opposes. It's the district
Ronald Reagan will go home to in January, and the Democrats want
Hart to represent him in the House when he does.
   SOUTH CAROLINA 4TH: Freshman Rep. Liz Patterson is one of the
most endangered Democrats in the House, and Republican attorney Knox
White is trying hard to recapture a district that usually votes
strongly for the GOP.
   NEBRASKA 2ND: This open seat was vacated when GOP Rep. Hal Daub
made an unsuccessful run for the Senate nomination. It's developed
into a costly fight between former Democratic state Sen. Peter
Hoagland and Republican Jerry Schenken, a pathologist.
   NEW JERSEY 3RD: State Sen. Frank Pallone hopes to keep this
Jersey Shore district for the Democrats, who held it for 24 years
under Rep. James Howard until his death last spring. Pallone faces
supermarket chain owner Joseph Azzolina, a former state legislator
who was enlisted for the race prior to Howard's death.
   RHODE ISLAND 1ST: House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St
Germainm, seeking a 15th term, was dubbed the most vulnerable
Democratic incumbent by the National Republican Congressional
Committee and faced renewed reports of an investigation of alleged
ethical misconduct. Late polls showed him running even with GOP
challenger Ronald K. Machtley.

   Here is a brief look at key gubernatorial races that voters will
decide on Nov. 8:
   INDIANA _ Democrat Evan Bayh, 32-year-old secretary of state and
son of former U.S. Sen. Birch E. Bayh, leads Republican Lt. Gov.
John M. Mutz in a bid to break the GOP's 20-year hold on the office.
The contest is being watched for the coattail effect of the
Bush-Quayle ticket in Sen. Dan Quayle's home state. Republican Gov.
Robert Orr is barred by law from a third term.
   NORTH CAROLINA _ Republican Gov. Jim Martin leads Democratic Lt.
Gov. Bob Jordan in a race that has used television with creative
malice. Jordan has lampooned Martin's budget-writing process with a
commercial starring chimpanzees in business suits. Martin has run an
ad with footage of Jordan telling black newspaper editors he agrees
with them on some issues but won't discuss them publicly for fear of
alienating ``rednecks.''
   RHODE ISLAND _ Republican Edward D. DiPrete is in a tight race
for re-election against Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun, a communications
executive who lost to DiPrete by a landslide in 1986. Sundlun has
made an issue of news stories about DiPrete family land deals, an
unfinished bridge, the hiring of a reputed mobster's ex-wife for a
state job and state contracts awarded to DiPrete campaign
contributors.
   WEST VIRGINA _ Republican Arch Moore's bid for an unprecedented
fourth term appears headed for defeat against Democrat Gaston
Caperton, an insurance executive and political novice who spent a
record $2.1 million on the primary alone. Unemployment is high and
the government had to borrow $80 million to keep operating this year.
   UTAH _ Republican Norm Bangerter, seeking a second term, trails
Democrat Ted Wilson, former mayor of Salt Lake City. Independent
Merrill Cook has robbed Bangerter of support among conservatives who
blame him for the biggest tax increase in Utah history. Bangerter's
campaign is looking for a coattail effect from Bush and from GOP
Sen. Orrin Hatch.
   VERMONT _ Democrat Madeleine Kunin, Vermont's first woman
governor, was favored to win a third two-year term against state
House GOP leader Michael Bernhardt. She has a robust economy,
including the nation's lowest unemployment rate, in her favor.
Bernhardt has sought to capitalize on opposition to Vermont's
``growth bill,'' a measure to control development. The law brought
out the independent, anti-government streak in hunters, trappers,
farmers and others.

   Here is a brief look at major statewide and local ballot issues,
organized by topic, that voters will decide on Nov. 8:
   _ Auto Insurance: CALIFORNIANS will choose among five conflicting
measures each aimed at reducing car insurance premiums and reforming
the rate-setting process.
   _ Abortion: Pro- and anti-abortion groups have focused their
fight on MICHIGAN where voters could outlaw tax-financed abortions
for the poor. In ARKANSAS, a proposed amendment would likewise rule
out tax-financed abortions and protect life from conception to
birth. COLORADANS will decide whether to repeal a constitutional
amendment similar to Arkansas'.
   _ Gun control: MARYLAND voters will decide whether to keep a law
passed this spring designed to ban cheap handguns known as Saturday
Night Specials.
   _ ``Official English'': FLORIDA, COLORADO and ARIZONA voters may
declare English their states' official language.
   _ Smoking: OREGONIANS are considering the toughest statewide
smoking ban in the nation, placing most public places off limits.
CALIFORNIANS may raise the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack, the
biggest ever, using proceeds to promote health.
   _ Gambling: IDAHO, KENTUCKY and MINNESOTA voters will consider
legalizing a state lottery. INDIANANS may clear the way for a
lottery and parimutuel betting. SOUTH DAKOTANS will decide whether
to permit a return of legal gambling in Deadwood, the town where
Wild Bill Hickok was shot 112 years ago playing poker.
   _ Taxes: Tax-limiting proposals are on ballots in COLORADO, UTAH
and SOUTH DAKOTA. In ARKANSAS, a ``Fair Tax Amendment'' would make
it easier for the Legislature to hike income taxes. NEVADA gambling
interests are backing a proposed constitutional ban on personal
income taxes.
   _ AIDS: In CALIFORNIA, Paul Gann, who a decade ago helped
engineer the state's Proposition 13 tax revolt, is now crusading for
Proposition 102 imposing tough anti-AIDS measures opposed by the
medical establishment and others as ineffective and unfair.
   _ Homosexual Rights: OREGONIANS will decide whether to revoke
Gov. Neil Goldschmidt's order banning discrimination against state
employees on the basis of sexual orientation. Voters in FORT
COLLINS, COLO., consider a proposal prohibiting discrimination in
jobs, housing or public accommodations.
   _ Wages and Benefits: A MASSACHUSETTS referendum could repeal the
state's 74-year old ``prevailing wage'' law requiring communities to
pay union wages and benefits on public projects. In CALIFORNIA,
Proposition 97 would require the restoration of funds for the
California Occupational Safety and Health Agency, which was
dismantled by Gov. George Deukmejian last year.
   _ Seat Belts: MONTANANS will vote on whether to repeal the
state's year-old law requiring motorists and their passengers to
wear seat belts.
   _ Road Repair: NEW YORKERS will decide whether to borrow a record
$3 billion to repair that state's aging roads and bridges.
   _ Family farming: SOUTH DAKOTANS may ban all but family farms
from owning or operating hog confinement facilities.
   _ Nuclear Power: In MASSACHUSETTS, two nuclear power plants could
be forced to shut down if voters approve a binding referendum
prohibiting any plant which produces nuclear waste from operating in
that state. NEBRASKANS will decide whether to become the first state
to pull out of an interstate nuclear waste compact, raising fears of
similar defections nationwide.
   _ Bottle Bill: MONTANANS may establish system of refundable
deposits on all glass, metal and plastic beverage containers sold in
the state.
   _ ``Mandela'': Predominantly black sections of BOSTON could
become a separate new city named after South African black
nationalist Nelson Mandela.
   _ Hazardous Waste: In WASHINGTON state, environmental groups
support Initiative 97 giving the state Department of Ecology
unilateral authority to order hazardous waste sites cleaned up,
impose stiff fines and pursue criminal sanctions against polluters
who balk. Rival Initiative 97B backed by the business community and
most state legislators would allow polluters time to negotiate.
   _ Tort Reform: A proposed constitutional amendment in FLORIDA
would limit damages for bodily injury claims to $100,000 for
non-economic losses such as pain and suffering or mental anguish.
   _ Strip-mining: SOUTH DAKOTANS are considering requiring strip
miners to restore land to its original contours where possible.
   _ Palestinian Rights: The college towns of BERKELEY, CALIF., and
CAMBRIDGE, MASS., are considering referendums supporting Palestinian
rights and calling for an to Israel's occupation of Gaza and the
West Bank.
   _ Growth Limits: After years of promoting tourism and growth,
residents of Massachusetts' CAPE COD face three ballot measures
aimed at reigning in development.

<HEAD>Chinese Millionaire Befuddles Communist Party _ He Wants to Join</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHENYANG, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liu Xigui is a gritty peasant who struck
it rich by parlaying a beat-up truck into a flourishing transport
company.
   Now he wants to join the Communist Party and has clearly
befuddled authorities who now must decide whether a millionaire
entrepreneur, by Chinese standards, should join the vanguard of the
proletarian masses.
   ``It's a question the party never had to address since its
founding in 1921,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said in a recent
report on Liu.
   But the question seems inevitable in the China of leader Deng
Xiaoping, where private enterprise has been encouraged for the past
decade to help develop the country.
   Liu, 34, first applied for party membership in 1986 but a final
decision has been delayed as his test case is debated by officials
throughout the country. Local Communist officials believe a ruling
may come by the end of the year.
   If any millionaire can gain entrance to the party, Liu appears an
ideal candidate.
   A farmer in the rural outskirts of Shenyang, a gray industrial
center of Liaoning province in northeastern China, Liu scrapped
together 7,000 yuan ($1,882) in 1979 to buy a used truck and go into
the transport business. The investment included money earned by
selling his blood 37 times.
   Liu's enterprise prospered and grew to its current size of almost
50 trucks and 260 employees. He has about 5.2 million yuan ($1.4
million) in assets and claimed this year's net profit will be
roughly 2 million yuan ($538,000).
   But Liu draws a monthly salary of only 500 yuan ($134) and lives
with his wife and son in a simple home, where the floor tiles are
broken and loose and the only sign of consumer extravagance is a
Japanese-made double-cassette tape player and television.
   Although his income far exceeds the national annual average of
about 1,000 yuan ($270) per person in urban areas, most of Liu's
profits don't reach his pockets.
   Instead, the money goes to the government in taxes, is reinvested
in the company or is donated, Liu explained in a recent interview at
his office.
   The donations, which this year have reached about 140,000 yuan
($37,600), are handed out for schools, road repairs, local welfare
programs and sporting teams, he said.
   Liu, dressed in a blue blazer and working on his daily pack of
Old Porcelain cigarettes, explained why he would be a good addition
to the party.
   ``One reason is to add some blood to the Communist Party,'' he
said. Another would be to show the world that the emerging class of
``private entrepreneurs'' has secured a place in China's ruling
party.
   A lean man with thin moustache who untiringly works to make his
company successful, Liu added that joining the Communist Party would
help him develop his business. But he claimed a higher purpose for
applying for membership.
   ``The purpose of entering the party is to make a contribution to
the country. ... I'm not afraid of the restrictions of party
discipline. I only want to contribute to socialism.'' He said he
would willingly surrender his property to the government if so
ordered.
   Local party officials, who grew up with Liu, seem to view him as
a folk hero and support his application, although they said the
final decision must be made by the Shenyang city party committee.
   Xinhua reported some party members believe ``that most of the
property of the millionaires was acquired by squeezing the surplus
value of workers they employed. That's exploitation, they said.''
   ``They contend it is ridiculous to think that an exploiter with
large amounts of surplus value could become a Communist and devote
his life to the elimination of the exploitiation system.''
   Such sentiment certainly reflects the Communists' traditional
attitude toward the wealthy. When the party came to power in the
1940s, confiscation of property from landlords was a key to winning
support in the countryside. As recently as the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, people were persecuted just for being rich.
   But Li Junku, the party chairman in Taoxian village where Liu
lives, argued that the critical factor is not how much money one
makes but ``how the profits are allotted.''
   Hundreds of party members have written to the Liaoning provincial
party committee in support of Liu, Xinhua said, including many who
believe private businessmen should not be rejected just because they
have accumulated more personal property than others.
   ``I believe I'm a socialist; a rich socialist,'' said Liu, who
stressed he has prospered by following the policies of China's
market-oriented reforms.
   ``From my own point of view, I don't want personal gain (by
joining the party),'' Liu said. But he believes successful
businessmen now have a role to play in plotting China's future
development.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Facing Deportation Takes Sanctuary in English Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nearly two years, Viraj Mendis has
not stepped outside an Anglican church in Manchester. To do so, he
says, means he will be deported to his native Sri Lanka and certain
death.
   He sleeps in the minister's tiny robing room and dreams of
walking in a park, but he stays in the church because he believes
the British government won't send police in to arrest him _ even
though they can legally pick him up at any time.
   The 32-year-old political activist chose the ancient right of
sanctuary as a last resort in his fight to keep from being sent back
to Sri Lanka, the island nation formerly called Ceylon off India's
southern tip.
   His case has become a test for the revival of the sanctuary
movement in Britain.
   ``If I'm allowed to win, it would be seen as a big victory for
sanctuary in this country and that will open up the doors,'' Mendis
said.
   Mendis predicted hundreds of illegal immigrants will take refuge
in churches and mosques if he succeeds, especially since appeals
against deportation have been severely restricted in a new
immigration law.
   Mendis has lost two immigration appeals, a High Court judicial
review and a Court of Appeal ruling. He is waiting to see whether
Parliament's House of Lords, Britain's highest court, will hear his
case.
   Mendis took refuge in the Church of the Ascension in Manchester's
rundown, mainly black, Hulme district Dec. 20, 1986, two days after
Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who is in charge of immigration, signed
a deportation order against him for ``overstaying'' in Britain.
   The tall, bearded and bespectacled Mendis, son of a Sri Lankan
tea plantation manager, came to Britain in 1973 on a student visa to
study electrical engineering at the University of Manchester.
   He finished two years and had a visa until 1975. He said he got
into financial difficulties, dropped out of school and went to work.
He added that he became so disenchanted with the treatment of blacks
that he joined a communist splinter group.
   A member of Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority, Mendis said he was
appalled by what he considered racism in his own country against the
minority Tamils and after severe rioting in his homeland in 1983, he
participated in several pro-Tamil demonstrations in England.
   ``At that stage I knew if I go back to Sri Lanka now, I've had it
because Sinhalese people who support the Tamils are considered
traitors,'' he said.
   But the Home Office and the courts have ruled that his fear of
persecution is not well-founded, a contention supported by the Sri
Lankan High Commission, which said he ``is free to go to Sri Lanka
without impediment.''
   However, the human rights organization Amnesty International as
well as church and refugee groups and a recent independent public
inquiry have supported Mendis, saying he could face persecution,
especially from Sinhalese extremists.
   ``There is clear evidence that people who have been deported from
Britain to Sri Lanka during the past year have suffered torture,''
said David Haslam of he British Council of Churches race relations
unit.
   The Rev. John Methuen, rector of the Hulme district, said his
Church of the Ascension decided to offer Mendis sanctuary because
``we believe we are trying to save a man's life.'' He said the
congregation wasn't concerned that Mendis is an atheist.
   Mendis and his supporters, who maintain a 24-hour guard at the
church, have been targets of hate mail and threatening phone calls.
The church had a bomb scare. One supporter was stabbed in the back
of the neck. Another was followed home and had a swastika carved on
the top of her hand with a razor blade.
   Mendis said the real reason the British government wants to
deport him is that ``they don't want any more black people in this
country. ... That's really at the heart of it, and to make it worse,
I'm not only a black person, I'm a communist as well.''
   The Home Office refused to comment on the case saying Secretary
Hurd ``is content to abide by the decision of the court in this
matter and we would hope that Mr. Mendis would do the same.''
   But Mendis said he won't leave the church unless the deportation
order is lifted. He sleeps on a sofa bed in the robing room and eats
meals provided by members of the community.
   The right of sanctuary was an accepted part of British common law
until 1623 when it was abolished by Parliament, but the tradition of
sanctuary in a church has held.
   Methuen said he doesn't believe Hurd ``wants to go down in
history'' as the first home secretary to send police into a church.
The clergyman maintained Hurd has other options, such as lifting the
deportation order to allow further investigation.
   Mendis believes that his support in the local community and fears
that his arrest could spark riots have so far kept police away. But
he said the Home Office may move against him soon because ``they
want to destroy the sanctuary movement.''

<HEAD>An Actor Idealist</HEAD>

   Danny Glover does not hesitate to call himself an
idealist: The actor hopes he can make the real world a better place
through the world of make-believe.
   ``I deal with fantasy,'' he said. ``I deal with the process that
in my mind things are going to change. I give that as a given. It
takes a concerted effort on all our parts to bring about that
change.''
   Glover has tried to do just that in different ways. He was a
student activist in the late 1960s when he attended San Francisco
State College, and his involvement with the anti-war movement
inspired him to pursue acting.
   ``I thought drama was a way of touching people, of providing them
with information, getting them to react.''
   In his latest film, ``Bat 21,'' Glover plays Birddog, a Vietnam
War spotter pilot who must rescue a middle-aged officer (Gene
Hackman), who is stranded in enemy territory. The movie centers on
their relationship, which develops without their ever setting eyes
on one another.
   The experience of not being able to see Hackman reminded Glover
of an exercise from his theatrical training.
   ``You're blindfolded and someone leads you around and talks to
you. They can be just having a converation with you and you can't
see where you're going, You're just listening to them and hearing
them. It heightens your other senses in doing this, establishing a
relationship wuith just trust in listening and hearing.
   ``The key to acting is just listening.''
   Glover brought this approach to ``Bat 21.''
   ``I would sometimes read some of the lines to Gene and put myself
in the position where I couldn't see what he was doing,'' Glover
said. ``I used the intonations with his voice, used whatever he
brought to the situation to try to ascertain what was happening.''
   The rock star Stevie Wonder once made a group of critics listen
to his new record blindfolded so they could hear the music the way
he did: without the benefit of sight.
   ``A perfect example if you use Stevie,'' Glover said. ``He's able
to interpret who you are, what you're about, just by listening to
you. He'll say, `I saw Aretha Franklin.' His interpration of seeing
is hearing the words and being affected by the words.''
   Glover, the son of postal employees, grew up in San Francisco.
Through an actor's workshop in the mid-70s, he met South African
playwright Athol Fugard and appeared in four of his plays, notably
``Master Harold ... and the Boys.''
   His first major film role came in 1984 when he appeared as Sally
Field's farmhand, Moze, in ``Places of the Heart.'' He played a
heavy in ``Witness,'' and starred as a cop in ``Lethal Weapon.'' He
received an Academy Award nomination for his role of Mr. in ``The
Color Purple,'' the film version of Alice Walker's best-selling
novel.
   Although, ``Mr.,'' Whoopi Goldberg's abusive husband, was widely
regarded as evil and drew criticism for its negative portrayal of a
black male, Glover felt sympathy for the character.
   ``I try to instill in every character I'm involved with a sense
of completion, a sense of many facets. I don't think that `Mr.'
defined himself as being a bad person,'' he said.
   Glover sought to understand the origins of his character's anger.
   ``I said to myself that he wanted to feel good about himself,''
he said. ``He wanted to feel loved, he wanted to feel close to
someone. He was capable of loving and feeling close to his wife and
anything short of that made him feel different.
   ``If you think of something hard enough and in the process of
thinking about it, something diverts your attention, it makes you
upset.''
   In ``Bat 21'' as well, Glover worked hard to make his character a
complete person.
   ``I tried to focus on every part of him. I was dealing with a man
who had a passion for flying ever since he was a kid. He certainly
felt that he had the short end of things. He had the knowledge and
ability of white pilots but was looked over.
   ``He had a strong sense of himself as a pilot and that maintained
him and allowed him to go on.''
   Glover's sense of himself comes from believing in the possibility
of change. In college, that belief came from the civil rights
movement.
   ``Watching people attacked, that had a profound impact on me.
When I came to college, I was open to the possibility of growing
politically. I came at a very unique time in history. All of us were
throwing away those shackles and confinement.''
   And after politics, Glover brought his idealism to the stage.
   ``It allowed me more contact with people,'' he said. ``I wasn't
distancing myself in a lot of economic theories. I did stuff that I
thought affected people. They laugh, they cry, they're moved by it.
Nothing does that more than art.''

   Twenty-five years ago, AP correspondent Mike
Cochran covered the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas and
reported on the slaying and burial of Lee Harvey Oswald and the
murder trial of Jack Ruby. In this article, he explores the
significance of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death and how the
events and mysteries of November 1963 still affect us all.

   As Air Force One began its descent into Carswell
Air Force Base, President John F. Kennedy glanced down through the
darkness. Amber lights silhouetted the Fort Worth skyline and gave
the city a friendly, festive glow.
   ``Spectacular,'' Kennedy told Congressman Jim Wright.
   The date was Nov. 21, 1963, and the presidential party had flown
to Fort Worth for the third stop on a whirlwind tour designed to end
the left-right squabbling among bitterly factionalized Texas
Democrats and secure the state for the presidential election the
following year.
   A crowd estimated at 6,000 greeted Kennedy and his wife,
Jacqueline, at Carswell, and thousands more lined the motorcade
route to the old Hotel Texas, where the president would spend his
final night.
   A 26-year-old AP reporter caught his first glimpse of an American
president that evening and, in that era of innocence, was every bit
as excited as a small-town West Texan should have been.
   Hours later, that AP reporter joined other numbed and dismayed
colleagues in covering the death of his president and the wounding
of Gov. John B. Connally. Just days later, he covered the slaying of
Lee Harvey Oswald and, drafted for the task, helped carry his body
to its grave.
   Then came the 1964 murder trial of Jack Ruby, the Ides of March
conviction, a death sentence and an appellate court ruling that set
the verdict aside. Ruby died of cancer before he could be retried.
   Through the years, there were interludes with Oswald's widow,
Marina, and turbulent, intriguing bouts with his mother, Marguerite,
whose favorite pastime was haranguing Fort Worth reporters.
   And always the conspiracy buffs, the researchers dedicated to
proving the Warren Commission's basic conclusion a lie, and not a
very convincing one at that.
   They insisted Oswald was not the killer or, at the very least,
was not the sole triggerman.
   In 1981, the conspiracies peaked with a trip to Rose Hill
Cemetery to dig up the body buried 18 years before in Oswald's
grave. A British author had claimed we had buried an impostor, a
Russian spy in fact. He was wrong. Forensic tests at Baylor
University Medical Center proved it was indeed Oswald.
   Although the echoes of gunfire in Dealey Plaza grow fainter with
each passing autumn, the events of November 1963 continue to touch
us all in mystifying ways and to different degrees.
   This month, there will be network and cable documentaries, new
books, an all-night Capitol vigil and memorials by former Peace
Corps volunteers and PT boat veterans. Millions of words will be
written.
   Still, Kennedy family members would prefer that remembrances of
the slain president be changed.
   ``They have tried to get away from commemorating the day of his
death and try to celebrate the day of his birth,'' says Melody
Miller, an aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   What is the significance of this 25th anniversary and the
anniversaries that preceded it? Do we know the legacy of Dallas? Or
the lessons of 1963?
   Historians may one day pinpoint all this and more.
   But don't bet on it.

   Anyone old enough to read or watch television 25 years ago can
recite from memory the events of November 22.
   Kennedy spoke twice in Fort Worth that morning, first to a crowd
of 5,000 who had gathered in the rain in the hotel parking lot. Vice
President Lyndon Johnson and Connally joined him, but Jackie did not.
   ``It takes a little longer to put herself together, that's why
she's prettier than we are,'' the president joked with the cheering
crowd.
   Inside, Kennedy addressed a sold-out Chamber of Commerce
breakfast in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. That group totaled 2,050,
with 50 extra tickets allotted at the last minute to the black
community.
   No blacks, no breakfast speech, the White House said when told
the president would be addressing an all-white audience.
   It was Kennedy's final speech, but Jackie stole the show, looking
lovely and self-assured in a two-piece pink suit with matching
pillbox hat.
   Kennedy and his entourage then returned to Carswell for the short
flight to Dallas, where the president was to address a luncheon at
the Trade Mart.
   In Dallas, 200,000 people, many on lunch breaks, jammed the
streets to see the 46-year-old president and his 34-year-old wife.
Smiling and waving, Jackie sat at her husband's side as the
motorcade rolled through the canyons of downtown Dallas.
   Delighted and relieved by the big, friendly reception, Nellie
Connally, the governor's wife, turned from her seat in front of
Kennedy and said:
   ``No one can say Dallas doesn't love and respect you, Mr.
President.''
   ``You sure can't,'' he replied.
   Seconds later, the motorcade passed in front of the Texas School
Book Depository and into a sniper's cross hairs.

   The first year after the assassination was difficult for most
Americans. It was a nightmare for Texans, particularly those living
in Dallas.
   A number of publications found much to dislike about Texas and
most were mightily concerned with the so-called ``mood of Dallas''
and the accommodation granted its far-right fanatics in the
conservative mainstream.
   In an editorial headlined ``A Year Later,'' the Dallas Morning
News touched on the ``scathing and unjust criticism'' of Dallas and
observed how the city stood alone ``in the spotlight of unfavorable
conspicuousness.''
   The editorial did not mention the small but noisy element of
right-wingers whose agitation had prompted Kennedy's visit 12 months
before.
   Perhaps it was unimportant. What seemed to matter to the
newspaper was that hysteria and shock had subsided and the city
could move ahead with new resolve and high purpose.
   November 22 that year fell on a Sunday, and a still sorrowful
nation remembered Kennedy in prayers and memorial services across
the country.
   It had been a year of memorials.
   The U.S. Space Flight Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., was renamed
Cape Kennedy, but later was changed back. New York changed the name
of its international airport from Idlewild to John F. Kennedy.
   Congress authorized construction of a cultural center in
Washington to be named in Kennedy's honor, and Harvard University
announced plans for a Kennedy Memorial Library.
   By the end of the year, it seemed certain that more American
streets, avenues and boulevards would be named Kennedy than Main.

<TEXT>
   The Dallas ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the
assassination was so brief and simple it almost slipped past
unnoticed.
   Fifty people gathered for the prayer service near the spot where
Kennedy was slain. A city official laid a wreath of red and white
carnations beside the bronze marker that tells the assassination
story.
   The news was dominated by the Vietnam war and the 1968 election.
Pain still lingered from the slayings earlier that year of Martin
Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.

   By the 10th anniversary in 1973, reporters were getting lathered
up over Watergate. In Dallas, 500 people gathered near the
assassination site, but the top news story of the day was an
18-minute gap in a Nixon White House tape recording.
   The JFK focus in 1973 was shifting to conspiracy theories, fed by
books and a movie called ``Executive Action'' that laid blame for
the Kennedy killing on a group of greedy Texas oilmen.
   ``There's nothing new. My view is the same _ Oswald did all the
shooting,'' retired district attorney Henry Wade said in an
interview last month. ``I haven't seen anything to change my mind. I
feel like somebody might have planted the seed or thought that
somebody ought to kill him (Kennedy) while in town. But there is
absolutely no proof of anything like that.''
   Fifteen years ago, Wade, who would have prosecuted Oswald had he
lived, was less certain.
   ``I find it hard to believe that Oswald didn't have help,'' he
told the AP in 1973. ``Call it a gut feeling on my part. I don't
have any evidence to back it up. But I believe there was a
conspiracy. You just don't go downtown one morning and kill the
president.''
   The widow of J.D. Tippit, the police officer Oswald shot after
fleeing the school book warehouse, had remarried by the 10th
anniversary. A lawyer said the $600,000 she received from a
sympathetic public after Tippit's death went into a trust for their
three children.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the spartan fifth anniversary, the landmark 20th touched
all bases.
   Movies, television specials, documentaries, books, magazine
articles and news stories explored the assassination anew.
   In 1963, Marina Oswald, at age 22, was a stranger in a foreign
land, a frightened young woman with few friends, no money, no job,
no future, two infant daughters and a dead husband accused of
killing the president of the United States.
   ``It was horrible,'' she told the AP 20 years later.
   ``For a while I thought it would all blow over, just go away. But
now I accept the fact that I must live with this for the rest of my
life.''
   Less than two years after the assassination, Marina married
Kenneth Porter, a carpenter, and they moved to a country house north
of Dallas.
   She was then and remains today uncertain of Oswald's guilt and
whether he acted alone. She initially agreed with the Warren
Commission that Oswald was the lone assassin, but doubts crept in
and she later changed her mind.
   But, she told the AP, ``I don't have any desire to waste the rest
of my life trying to prove something that cannot be proven.''
   There are those, however, who are obsessed with doing precisely
that.
   In 1983, an AP story first pulled together theories about the
Black Dog Man, the Umbrella Man, the Mafia Con Man, the Tall Tramp
and a man called Frenchy. The article also looked at publications
called ``The Continuing Inquiry,'' ``Coverups!'' and ``Echoes of
Conspiracy.''
   Those are names and newsletters well-known to the self-described
``theorists'' or ``critics'' who claim there is a sinister and still
secret story behind the assassination.
   They raise provocative questions but provide few answers.
   That brings us to the 25th anniversary and the latest theories.
   A British television documentary entitled ``The Men Who Killed
Kennedy,'' broadcast Oct. 25, claimed three gangsters from
Marseilles, France, assassinated Kennedy on orders from U.S.
organized crime.
   The two-hour documentary on Central Television identified the
purported assassins by name and said one was shot to death in Mexico
in 1972, a second was working in Colombia's drug trade and the third
was living in Marseilles after his recent release from prison.
   But the day after the program aired, a Marseilles newspaper
assembled records indicating that two of them could not have been in
Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963; one was serving on a minesweeper from Oct.
16, 1962, to April 16, 1964, according to French navy headquarters,
and another was in a Marseilles jail cell that day, according to the
Justice Ministry.
   In addition, the newspaper account quoted the navy veteran as
saying that the third man singled out was also in jail on the day of
the assassination.
   The program was based on a four-year inquiry by American writer
and researcher Steve Rivele and the program's British director,
Nigel Turner.
   In this country, a syndicated television report is reviving the
theory that Kennedy's assassination was an act of revenge by
Lousiana mob boss Carlos Marcello, who was deported in 1961 by
then-U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The program, presented by
reporter Jonathan Kwitny, was broadcast in New York Nov. 1 and will
air elsewhere this month.
   The report said evidence indicated that Oswald and Ruby had
connections to Marcello: Oswald through his uncle, who purportedly
worked for the Marcello organization, and Ruby through drug
trafficking, which would have been controlled by Marcello.
   In a two-hour television special Nov. 2, columnist Jack Anderson
argued another theory involving the Mafia, that Kennedy was a victim
of underworld figures first hired by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro.
Anderson's special says Santo Trafficante, mob boss in Havana before
Castro took power in 1959, double-crossed the CIA and informed
Castro.
   Castro then made a deal with Trafficante to kill Kennedy,
Anderson theorized. Trafficante allegedly enlisted the suppport of
two other bosses, Marcello and Sam Giancana, and Oswald was set up
as the fall guy. Anderson's special also linked Ruby to the Mafia
plot.

   Back when the echoes of gunfire were still ringing in Dealey
Plaza, the media struggled to define the mood of Dallas and how the
city's right-wing tolerance might have figured in the assassination.
   They apparently failed.
   D Magazine, a slick Dallas monthly, unveiled its November 1988
issue with this cover: ``25 Years Later: Did Dallas Kill Kennedy?''
   Inside, there is a story entitled ``Was Dallas a City of Hate?''
   The debate goes on.
   Robert H. Johnson Jr., the AP's Texas bureau chief who directed
the news agency's assassination coverage, wrote the AP's first
startling words:
   ``BULLETIN
   ``DALLAS (AP) _ President Kennedy was shot today just as his
motorcade left downtown Dallas. Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and grabbed
Mr. Kennedy. She cried, `Oh, no!' The motorcade sped on.''
   Johnson, recently retired and living in New Mexico, remained in
Texas for six years after the shootings. Never once, he said, did he
drive past the book depository without getting a ``prickly feeling''
on the back of his neck.
   ``I still feel it,'' he said after a visit to Dallas this year.
``The event has got some kind of hold on Americans ... and many
foreigners as well. It's hard to explain.''
   Barbara Womble cannot explain it either. But she vividly
remembers the look on her fifth-grade teacher's face when he
dismissed his pupils in Chicopee Falls, Mass., that November
afternoon.
   ``Just by his expression, we knew something really big had
happened,'' she says now.
   Ms. Womble, 35, now director of marketing at upscale Highland
Park Village shopping complex in Dallas, said the whole issue is
muddled because the case has never been solved.
   ``But to me, the way to work out our emotions of guilt and regret
is to discuss them openly and repeatedly,'' she said. ``They just
don't vanish.''

<HEAD>Australia Raises Its Own Call for Ending Global Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australia, for its own reasons, has allied
itself with the United States in seeking an end to global farm
subsidies, although the two countries still are a long way from
waltzing in perfect step.
   Meanwhile, the Reagan administration says the United States is
still committed to scrapping all trade-distorting agricultural
subsidies by the year 2000 but may consider accepting scaled-down
goals for 1989 and 1990.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said last month that
such interim proposals could be adopted at a meeting of the
96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Montreal, which
begins Dec. 5.
   But Yeutter said U.S. negotiators would not go along with the
interim subsidy reductions unless there is a strong GATT committment
to pursue the total elimination of farm subsidies as part of the
current Uruguay Round of trade talks.
   The European Economic Community, a longtime thorn for U.S. policy
makers because of its highly subsidized production and exports, has
consistently attacked as unrealistic the administration's bid to
eliminate all farm subsidies and barriers to world trade.
   Another voice in the debate is the so-called Cairns Group, a bloc
that includes a Australia and a dozen other countries working for
the elimination of constraints on agricultural trade.
   The Cairns Group _ named after the Australian city _ is much
closer to the goals of the United States than to the EEC's policy of
generally favoring more government assistance to agriculture and
constraints on farm trade, says an Agriculture Department report.
   ``Australian government officials say their number one objective
in the GATT negotiations is to phase out farm export subsidies,''
the report said. ``Australian farmers contend that their export
revenues have been reduced because of EEC subsidized grain, dairy,
sugar and beef exports, and U.S. grain export programs.''
   The report is in this month's issue of Farmline magazine, which
is published by the department's Economic Research Service.
   Australia, it said, is reducing government assistance to farmers,
even though it already has ``one of the lowest levels of
agricultural protection'' among the developed countries of the world.
   By the USDA agency's reckoning and the use of ``producer subsidy
equivalents,'' or PSEs, to measure how big a role government plays
in the agriculture of various nations, Australia's farmers get only
11 percent of their gross income from government assistance.
   The gross income of Japanese farmers, on the other hand, included
72 percent government assistance; the EEC, 35 percent; Canada, 31
percent; and the United States and New Zealand, each 25 percent.
   Australia's manufacturing industry is ``well protected by the
government,'' says agency economist David Skully. Agriculture, on
the other hand, is ``taxed'' rather than subsidized. That is, he
said, Australian farmers lose, not gain, in net payments to and from
their government and the protected industrial sector.
   ``The indirect costs of business tariffs to the farmers are more
than the amount of government farm payments,'' Skully said.
   Earlier this year, the Australian government announced policy
reforms, including plans to abolish or significantly reduce
government payments and other assistance to farmers, he said. The
Australian economy, it was said, cannot afford to engage in domestic
or export subsidies.
   Skully said that under the proposed reforms, Australian
assistance to agriculture would decline by 1990 to about half its
1986 level. And ``these reductions are unilateral and
unconditional,'' he said. No bargaining with other countries is
involved.
   Australia has a long history of protection for industry as a way
of guaranteeing a fair wage to industrial workers. Skully said
farmers, who are dependent on the industrial sector for machinery
and other goods, have been hit hard by that protection.
   The effective rate of government assistance to Australia's
automobile industry, for example, is 250 percent, and for men's
clothing, 100 percent, he said. By contrast, flour milling and
cotton ginning not only receive no subsidies, they are taxed at
about 20 percent.
   Argentina and New Zealand in recent years are also where
``taxes'' on agriculture exceed government support, Skully said.
   ``In such countries, the cities live off the farms instead of the
farmers living off the cities as in many nations,'' he said.
``Farming is in reality a cash flow for countries that tax
agriculture.''
   The Australian agricultural sector is small compared with the
farm economies of some other industrialized countries, and this
limits Australia's bargaining power. The annual farm output of
Australia is valued at about $11 billion (in U.S. currency), and
about three-fourths is exported.
   In comparison, U.S. farm production is worth about $150 billion
annually, and exports account for about 20 percent.
   Australia is nearly as large as the contiguous United States but
has only 16 million people, about the population of Texas.
   Nina Swann, an economist colleague of Skully, said Australia's
agricultural policies ``reflect the countries comparative advantage
in extensive crop and livestock operations and its dependence on
exports.''
   Domestically, she said, the sales of major commodities are
regulated by law. In effect, those domestic pricing policies are a
subsidy paid by consumers to farmers. Even so, Australian food
prices are among the world's lowest.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Depict Selves As Friends Of The Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a summer when Americans baked in the heat
and watched beaches fouled by medical wastes, George Bush and
Michael Dukakis both fought hard to convince voters they were
friends of the environment.
   Bush was battling not only Dukakis, but a Reagan administration
record that environmental groups contend was often inimical to the
causes of clean air, land and water.
   But the vice president proclaimed himself an environmentalist and
took the battle to Boston Harbor, blaming the Massachusetts governor
for the squalid state of the harbor.
   Dukakis ridiculed Bush's ``election-year conversion'' and said
that Boston Harbor has ``been polluted for hundreds of years, and
I'm very proud to be the governor who's cleaning it up ... no thanks
to Vice President Bush and the administration he is part of.''
   Dukakis won the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters,
which gave him a grade of B versus a D-plus for Bush.
   Some environmentalists said Dukakis' record was not unspotted,
but it was a lot cleaner than that of the Reagan-Bush administration.
   ``Boston Harbor is not Michael Dukakis' shining moment,'' said
Jeff Webb, a Friends of the Earth lobbyist. ``But that's one issue
in one state. What about eight years of neglect?''
   Arlene O'Donnell of the Massachusetts Audobon Society said
Dukakis has exhibited a growing sensitivity to environmental issues,
although ``he still tends, on bulldozer-vs.-trees kind of things, to
take the business side.''
   Bush, citing the drought, forest fires and medical wastes that
washed up on beaches, called 1988 ``the year Earth spoke back.'' He
called for an international conference next year to discuss global
warming and ozone depletion.
   Bush said, ``In the past few years, we have not done enough to
protect the environment. I will do more.''
   Bush claimed he was always an environmentalist, and said there
has been a long tradition of support for the environment within the
GOP ``from Abraham Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt to Richard Nixon.''
   But it was the record of another Republican president, Ronald
Reagan, that gave environmentalists pause.
   Dukakis charged Bush was ``a charter member of the environmental
wrecking crew'' of former Interior Secretary James Watt and other
controversial Reagan administration appointees.
   Environmentalists faulted Reagan for his handling of the
Superfund to clean up toxic waste, for not acting to curb acid rain
and for vetoing a $20 billion authorization to clean up U.S.
waterways.
   Environmentalists say it was Bush's de-regulation task force that
enabled the Office of Management and Budget to secure veto power
over environmental and other regulations. Dukakis has promised to
revoke the Reagan executive order that allows that.
   Bush has backed a goal of ``no net loss of wetlands.'' He
supported a ban on ocean dumping of sludge, which Congress now has
ordered.
   Dukakis has called for protecting existing wetlands and restoring
``part of the vast endowment of wetlands that America has lost.''
But his administration approved filling a swamp for a shopping
center near Attleboro, a development that the Reagan Environmental
Protection Agency went to court to block.
   As governor, Dukakis fought to block licensing of the stillborn
Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire and to bar oil drilling in
the Georges Bank off the New England coast. As president, he
promises to block drilling off the Northern California coast and the
Florida Keys.
   Bush, a pioneer of the offshore drilling industry, last spring
endorsed a moratorium on drilling in ``many'' sensitive areas off
the California coast.
   On nuclear power, Dukakis opposes construction of new commercial
reactors until a new, safer design is developed and ways are found
to treat and dispose of nuclear waste.
   Bush says, ``I believe nuclear power must be a part of our energy
mix,'' and says he will ``insist on the highest safety standards.''
   On acid rain, Bush promises to ask Congress to cut millions of
tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and to reduce
nitrogen oxide emissions.
   Dukakis has said he will use authority under existing law to
force industrial states ``that are major contributors to the acid
rain problem to find solutions within three years.''
   Both favor ``clean coal'' research to tap the nation's abundant
supply of fossil fuel.
   Both support a global ban on chlorofluorocarbons, which are
destroying the ozone layer.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Take Opposite Stands on Abortion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The presidential candidates staked out opposite
sides in an often bitter debate over abortion, with Republican
George Bush wanting to outlaw nearly all abortions and Democrat
Michael Dukakis saying the government must not interfere with a
woman's choice.
   Bush favors a human life amendment to the Constitution and would
outlaw all abortions except in cases of rape, incest or to save the
life of the mother. He opposes Medicaid funding of abortions for
poor women except to save the woman's life.
   Prior to becoming Ronald Reagan's running mate in 1980, Bush
opposed a constitutional amendment to overturn legalized abortion.
He once supported federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or
incest, as well as to save the mother's life.
   Asked in 1984 why he changed his position, Bush replied: ``There
has been _ I have to make a confession _ an evolution in my
position. There's been 15 million abortions since 1973, and I don't
take that lightly.''
   Dukakis, who says he does not regard abortion as ``a good
thing,'' nonetheless is staunchly pro-choice. As governor of
Massachusetts he vetoed several bills that sought to restrict
Medicaid abortions for poor women.
   As the campaign neared its end, the Democrat frequently singled
out the abortion issue as a major difference between himself and
Bush.
   ``Mr. Bush wants the government to make what is one of the most
personal choices a woman can make,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I believe that a choice that personal must be made by the woman
in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs. And
that's one of the reasons why we don't want George Bush and Dan
Quayle appointing new justices to the Supreme Court,'' Dukakis told
a California crowd.
   Bush created a stir in the candidates' first debate Sept. 25 when
hew was asked if he favored jailing women who undergo abortions and
doctors who perform them.
   ``I haven't sorted out the penalties,'' Bush replied, but he
added, ``once that illegality is established ... there's got to be
some penalties to enforce the law.''
   His campaign manager, James Baker III, said the next morning Bush
had decided only the abortionist should be punished, not the woman.
   Dukakis was labeled ``a pro-abortion zealot'' by Dr. J.C. Willke,
president of the National Right to Life Committee. The group's
legislative director, Douglas Johnson, said, ``Dukakis says he's
personally opposed, but he wants to subsidize it on demand.''
   Johnson pointed out that as a state legislator in 1970, Dukakis
sponsored a bill to legalize abortion in Massachusetts.
   Anti-abortion activists often turned out to protest at rallies
held by Dukakis and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, was staunchly
anti-abortion. On the campaign trail, Quayle said he would urge his
wife, but not coerce her, to bear the child if she became pregnant
by rape.
   Quayle also told a 12-year-old Children's Express reporter that
she should not have an abortion even if she became pregnant by
incest.
   Bush, in his acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans on Aug. 18, said, ``Is it right to believe
in the sanctity of life and protect the lives of innocent children?
My opponent says no _ but I say yes. ... We've got to change from
abortion to adoption.''
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said, ``There is a stark, stark difference
between the two candidates'' and between the two parties' platforms
on abortion.
   The Democrats' terse platform, without mentioning the word
abortion, says, ``the right of reproductive choice should be
guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.''
   The GOP platform contains anti-abortion language in several
sections, including a plank that declares: ``the unborn child has a
fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.'' It
endorses both a human life amendment and legislation to extend the
14th Amendment's protections to the unborn.
   Bentsen has said he, too, personally opposes abortion and does
not favor federal funding except in cases of rape, incest or to save
the mother's life. But the National Right to Life Committee and the
National Abortion Rights Action League both agree that Bentsen has
usually voted against restrictions on abortion funding. Quayle
opposes abortion except to save the mother's life.
   Activists on both sides agree the next president is likely to
make several appointments to the Supreme Court that could sway the
tribunal's ruling on abortion.
   The current court has four justices who support the 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision, four who have been critical of it and one _ the
newest member, Anthony Kennedy _ whose views are not yet clear.
   ``My biggest concern is the next president's role in appointing
at least three Supreme Court justices, if not more,'' said Michelman.
   Johnson said, ``On Inauguration Day next January, there'll be
three pro-abortion justices over 80 years of age.''
   A human life amendment is ``a long ways down the road,'' he said,
but if the Democrats capture the White House, ``Dukakis could
appoint a pro-abortion majority for years to come.''
   Some 1.5 million abortions are performed in the United States
annually, compared with 586,760 in 1972, when abortion was legal in
only a few states.
   Johnson estimates that before abortions were legalized in New
York and elsewhere in the 1960s, some 200,000 were performed
illegally each year.

   In the battle for the White House, the fiercest
fight of all was waged over the defense budget, with George Bush
pounding Michael Dukakis for opposing new nuclear missiles and the
Democrat firing back that the Republicans have neglected ``our
troops in the field'' while pursuing a fantasy defense-shield in
space.
   Dukakis' opposition to the mobile MX and Midgetman missiles left
him on the defensive, while Bush was claiming the INF treaty with
the Soviets, the ceasefire in the Persian Gulf and the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan as evidence that the Reagan military
build-up was yielding dividends.
   When Dukakis donned a helmet and went for a ride in an M-1 tank,
the Republican used the film footage for ads ridiculing the Democrat
and charging he ``opposed virtually every defense system we
developed.''
   Dukakis took to reciting a litany of the new weapons he supports,
from the Stealth bomber to the Trident II missile for submarines to
advanced cruise missiles, as well as anti-tank and other
conventional weaponry.
   While Bush was quick to pounce on Dukakis' opposition to the MX
and Midgetman, he was slower to admit that he could not afford both,
if elected.
   ``My secretary of defense is going to have a very difficult
decision in which system to go forward with,'' the Republican said.
   There will be plenty of difficult decisions at the Pentagon for
the next president. Military and congressional analysts agree the
Pentagon budget would have to be raised by at least $250 billion
over the next five years to pay for all the new weapons in the
Pentagon pipeline.
   Both Dukakis and Bush have essentially ruled out such big
increases. Bush has said the military would be subject to his
``flexible freeze'' on all spending except Social Security. Dukakis
favors ``stable'' defense budgets.
   ``It's been a dirty little secret of the Reagan administration
that for the whole second term the defense budget has undergone real
declines,'' said Kenneth Adelman, Reagan's former director of the
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   After doubling in his first four years, the Pentagon budget has
fallen 10 percent in real dollars since 1985. It is still 53 percent
higher than before the Carter-Reagan build-up.
   Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan assistant secretary of defense,
said: ``Right now in defense you have a $400 billion program and a
$300 billion budget. Whoever gets in there is going to have to get
that program down. ... Something will have to go.''
   As he came under fire from Bush, Dukakis tempered his criticism
of the Midgetman, a single-warhead weapon favored by such Democrats
as Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia. Dukakis said current Midgetman
proposals are too expensive, but he would work with Congress ``to
find a sensible, affordable way'' to modernize land-based U.S.
missiles.
   Bush charged his opponent was ``viscerally uncomfortable with
anything related to the nuclear arsenal.'' He cited Dukakis' refusal
to allow construction in Massachusetts of a bakup radio network to
allow military communications during a nuclear war.
   Dukakis also favors scrapping two planned supercarrier task
forces that cost $18 billion each.
   On the Strategic Defense Initiative, Dukakis called for scaling
back the research budget from $4 billion to $1 billion and said:
``We'll continue research on strategic defenses, but we're not going
to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on a system our best
scientists say won't work, at a time when we're shortchanging our
troops in the field and mortgaging our future.''
   But Bush promised to develop and deploy SDI ``as fast as
possible'' so that the United States would not be defenseless
against ballistic missiles. Bush questioned why Dukakis would spend
``a dime'' on SDI if he considered it a fraud.
   Dukakis contended that what the American military really needs is
a ``conventional defense initiative'' to beef up front-line forces
in Europe.
   Bush said, ``I believe that the administration's approach in
rebuilding America's defenses is fundamentally correct.''
   But the big military build-up, which actually started in the
final years of the Carter administration, already is over.
   Building up conventional strength, as Dukakis promises, isn't
cheap.
   Adelman, now vice president of the Institute for Contemporary
Studies, said: ``Dukakis cannot save any money like he talks about
by cutting down the strategic forces and pouring those funds into
conventional forces. There's not going to be that much to pour in.
Strategic forces account for at the most 12 percent of the U.S.
defense budget. Eighty-eight percent is conventional.''
   Military analyst Joshua M. Epstein said it is Bush's figures that
don't add up.
   ``Bush is talking about trying to drive eight lanes of traffic
through a three-lane tunnel as far as the Pentagon budget is
concerned. He has just not realistically faced up to the budget
constraints that will be imposed by Congress,'' said Epstein, a
Brookings senior fellow.
   ``If you're not prepared to cut some of these glamor programs
then things like readiness and training and personnel and
maintenance and conventional forces are going to take a beating,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Social Security, in sickness and in health, has
been one of the Democratic Party's most potent political weapons of
the 1980s.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis hoped to galvanize elderly voters once
again with a broad-brush charge that Republican George Bush would
``raid the Social Security trust fund'' if elected.
   Bush sought to blunt the charge not only by vowing to keep his
hands off Social Security, but by accusing Dukakis of dipping into a
Massachusetts pension fund for $27 million to help balance his state
budget this year.
   Some lobbyists for the elderly are worried that regardless of
sworn statements and good intentions, Social Security will be a
tempting target next year and into the 1990s for politicians trying
to balance the federal budget.
   Robert Strauss, co-chairman of the National Economic Commission
which is supposed to recommend ways next spring to balance the
budget, touched off a firestorm in September by saying the only way
to cure the deficit is ``to go to Social Security, Medicare and
entitlements generally and ... defense.''
   Both the Dukakis and Bush campaigns disavowed the statement by
Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman.
   Thirty-eight million retirees, disabled workers and their
families count on that check in the mail on the third day of each
month from Social Security. They will get a 4 percent increase this
January.
   The $210 billion retirement and disability program, on the verge
of bankruptcy five short years ago, now is piling up huge surpluses.
Its trust funds which grew to $69 billion last year, will add $40
billion more in 1988 and are expected to swell to $646 billion by
the end of 1995.
   Dukakis has claimed Bush will be forced to ``raid'' those trust
funds if he is serious about cutting the capital gains tax, spending
more on the Pentagon and balancing the budget.
   Bush has said repeatedly he will not touch Social Security.
   ``If elected your president, I pledge that no one will take your
Social Security away from you,'' Bush says in a political flyer
aimed at the elderly.
   Although Social Security's trust funds technically are listed
apart from the rest of the federal budget, they are lumped together
when the deficit is tallied.
   Federal law prohibits spending Social Security's reserves on
other programs, but every dollar added to the trust funds reduces
the overall deficit.
   And since the trust funds must be invested in interest-bearing
U.S. securities, they reduce the amount the government must borrow
in private markets. The government uses the funds generated by
selling bonds to Social Security to cover the operating deficit in
other programs.
   Social Security didn't save Jimmy Carter in 1980 or Walter
Mondale in 1984, but Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., said it was the issue
that cost Republicans control of the Senate in 1986.
   Bush says he deserves credit with President Reagan for the 1983
legislation that restored Social Security's fiscal health.
   But Dukakis and others say Bush shares the blame for the deep
cuts Reagan sought in Social Security after taking office in 1981.
   As president of the Senate, Bush cast a tie-breaking vote on May
9, 1985, for a budget freeze that would have blocked Social
Security's 1986 cost-of-living adjustment.
   That freeze never materialized. Reagan, after initially
supporting it, abandoned the package and it died. Afterwards, he
adopted the hands-off policy toward Social Security Bush promises to
emulate.
   Bush points out that Dukakis voted that same year at a National
Governors Association meeting in favor of a federal budget freeze.
Dukakis did that, but only after waging a losing effort to exempt
Social Security.
   Dukakis did divert a $27 million surplus from a state pension
fund this year, but he says it was only after fully paying this
year's obligation, and he takes credit for a 1987 reform law that
marks the first time the state has ever set money aside for future
pension obligations.
   Bush's two top economic advisers, Martin Feldstein and Michael
Boskin, have been prominent academic critics of Social Security.
   Feldstein has argued that Social Security depresses private
savings. He also has proposed restricting cost-of-living increases
to the Consumer Price Index minus 2 percentage points.
   Boskin, in a 1986 book, ``Too Many Promises: The Uncertain Future
of Social Security,'' proposed to revamp Social Security to separate
its insurance and welfare aspects.
   But some Democratic economists, looking for ways to reduce the
deficit, are talking quietly of making more retirees pay income tax
on Social Security benefits. Only one retiree in 10 now is taxed on
Social Security.

<HEAD>Bush Plans `Flexible Freeze'; Dukakis Would Target Tax Cheats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Ronald Reagan entered the White House in
1981, the national debt was under $1 trillion. Today it has soared
to $2.6 trillion. Just paying the interest on that mountain of debt
now costs American taxpayers more than $150 billion a year.
   So what do Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis propose to do about the deficit?
   Despite the Republican's talk of a ``flexible freeze'' on most
government spending and the Democrat's hopes of reaping tens of
billions of dollars through tougher tax enforcement, economists say
neither presidential candidate has put forward a credible plan for
mopping up the tidal wave of red ink.
   The deficit has not emerged as a major campaign issue, despite
gloomy prognostications from some economists.
   The Treasury says it will pay $220 billion in gross interest on
the public debt in 1989. But the government also earns interest on
Social Security's trust funds and other reserves. The ``net''
interest cost to taxpayers is estimated at $151.8 billion for 1989.
   But there has been little pressure on Bush or Dukakis to fill in
the blanks of their deficit-reduction promises.
   Bush, who in 1980 derided as ``voodoo economics'' Reagan's
promise to balance the budget while cutting taxes and raising
military spending, now is following in Reagan's footsteps by
promising more tax cuts and hands off Social Security. He vows, ``I
will not raise your taxes, period.''
   His so-called ``flexible freeze'' applies to all government
spending other than Social Security and payment of interest on the
national debt.
   Bush would limit the overall growth of other government spending
to the rate of inflation, with increases in some areas offset by
unspecified cuts elsewhere.
   ``It's a commitment to slow the growth of government spending to
make even better progress in reducing the budget deficit than we
have been doing and are projected to do,'' said Michael J. Boskin, a
Stanford University economics professor and senior Bush adviser.
``Exactly when it would lead to a balanced budget depends on how
well the economy does.''
   Boskin said the annual deficit, which in 1983 was the equivalent
of 6.3 percent of the gross national product, is already down to 3.2
percent of GNP and is headed to 1.8 percent of GNP in 1993 even
without the flexible freeze according to a Congressional Budget
Office forecast.
   To critics who question how Bush will achieve his goal while
exempting Social Security, Boskin said, ``It leaves most of the
budget.'' He said Bush is committed to negotiating spending
restraints with Congress, but ``he doesn't think it's appropriate
that he lay out a detailed fiscal year 1990 budget during the
presidential campaign.''
   Like Reagan, Bush epouses a balanced budget amendment and
line-item veto authority _ Dukakis opposes both _ and says, ``The
most important action we need to take on the budget deficit is to
hold the line on taxing and spending.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic challenger, says, ``No serious candidate
can rule out the possibility of new taxes,'' but says that would
only be as ``a last resort.'' His first resort is tougher tax
enforcement.
   Dukakis, who watched Walter Mondale meet his Waterloo with a 1984
campaign declaration that higher taxes were inevitable, talks of
raising tens of billions of dollars through a one-time tax amnesty
and tougher enforcement. ``This is not a pie-in-the-sky formula,''
says Dukakis, who estimates $110 billion in taxes go uncollected
each year.
   Thomas Herman, a senior deputy issues director for the Dukakis
campaign, said Dukakis hopes to net $10 billion the first year and
$30 billion annually by 1993 from tax cheats.
   ``There are only four ways to reduce the federal budget deficit:
cut spending, increase revenue, lower interest rates and improve
economic performance. We must do all four,'' says Dukakis.
   Dukakis has outlined spending cuts on the Strategic Defense
Initiative and some weapons programs, and promised to make ``tough
choices'' elsewhere in the budget, including unspecified savings on
agriculture, welfare and health care, as well as cutting back
development of a supersonic space plane and paring support for
nuclear fission and fusion research. He rules out Social Security
cuts.
   Alice Rivlin, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and
former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said, ``Both
candidates have been quite vague about what they would do about the
deficit. Neither has put out any kind of a solid plan to bring the
deficit down.''
   ``The reason for that is there really isn't a good plan which can
avoid an increase in taxes. Nobody wants to dramatize that fact,''
she added.
   Lawrence Chimerine, chairman and chief economist of the WEFA
Group, said Bush would aggravate the deficit with a series of tax
cuts or credits he has promised, from lower taxes on capital gains
to a $1,000 ``toddler tax credit'' for poor families.
   Dukakis might find some savings in military and domestic spending
and bring in more revenues by beefing up the Internal Revenue
Service, ``but we're talking very small numbers,'' said Chimerine.
   Both candidates are counting on lower interest rates to help
reduce the deficit, but that is not necessarily within the
president's powers to deliver.
   ``It's Catch-22,'' said Chimerine. ``You can't get the drop in
interest rates until you put forth a credible program, but
fundamentally the drop in interest rates is essentially what their
program is.''
   David Keating, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers
Union, said, ``Bush's flexible freeze could work if he could get
Congress to follow it. But every time the vice president is in a
debate or public forum, he seems to come up with another spending
program.''
   Economist Michael Evans said both candidates are ``up a tree'' in
their quest for lower interest rates.
   ``Interest rates are likely to rise if the deficit rises. The Fed
(Federal Reserve Board) is going to have to defend the dollar next
year, and that's going to push the deficit higher,'' he predicted.
The Fed often raises interest rates to defend the dollar, but this
would also drive up the government's own borrowing costs and
increase the deficit.
   Evans said no one should take comfort from the fact that the
annual deficits have not yet derailed the 70-month-old economic
recovery.
   ``It's like that old line: `This is the way the world will end,
not with a bang but a wimper.' The deficit reduces our growth and
productivity. It diverts our assets to foreign investors,'' said
Evans. ``Just gradually the standard of living erodes.''
   Stephen Moore, an economic policy analyst at the conservative
Heritage Foundation, said the deficit already has come down from a
high of $220 billion two years ago.
   Economic growth is pushing up tax revenues by $60 billion a year,
and ``if you can hold the rate of spending increases to 4 percent a
year, the budget would be balanced in 1993,'' he said. ``I don't
think there's any reason to raise taxes whatsoever.''
   Rivlin said the deficit is even worse than it looks on paper,
because it is masked in part by the growth of Social Security's
trust funds. Those funds now are rising by $40 billion a year and by
the early 1990s will be piling up $100 billion annual surpluses.
   ``We ought to be aiming for a budget surplus by the end of the
1990s because we need more national savings,'' said Rivlin.
   Rivlin said the flexible freeze idea ``sounds good, but when you
look at it, it means Medicare and Medicaid would have to be cut
substantially or you'd have to cut a lot of other spending.'' The
big health care programs have been growing at twice the rate of
inflation in recent years, she said.
   While Bush has said cutting the capital gains tax rate from its
current maximum of 28 to 33 percent down to a flat 15 percent will
actually raise revenues, not lower them, the Congressional Budget
Office has estimated it will cost $3.9 billion a year in revenues.
Some estimates are even higher.
   Bush's tax credits for child care would cost nearly $2 billion,
his tax-deferred savings accounts for the middle-class cost $70
million to start and reach $550 million by 1993; his college savings
bonds cost up to $200 million, and a variety of other tax credits
for rural development and the energy industry could cost up to $1
billion more, acording to Democrats on Capitol Hill.
   Both Bush and Dukakis favor extending the research and
development tax credit, at a cost of more than $1 billion a year.
   Boskin said that putting aside the capital gains tax cut, Bush's
other tax breaks would cost only $4 billion a year, or ``less than
one-third of 1 percent of outlays'' in 1993.
   Rivlin said that ``putting back in little special exceptions for
this and that'' could eventually force lawmakers to raise the low
tax rates achieved in the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
   Bush and Dukakis have another excuse for staying mum on deficit
reduction: a bipartisan National Economic Commission already exists
to do some of the dirty work early next year on how to reduce the
deficit.
   Both candidates disavowed a recent statement by the commission's
co-chairman, Robert Strauss, who said the only way to solve the
deficit is to go after Social Security and other entitlements.
   The National Economic Commission could help the country end its
deficit-spending binge of the 1980s, but ``only if the new president
wants it to,'' said Rivlin. ``If the president wants it, he'll have
lots of help.''

   Both George Bush and Michael Dukakis talk about
wanting to be ``the education president,'' but educators say they
have offered little to show how they would earn that title.
   Many expected education issues to loom large in this race, and
there was even a candidates' debate last fall devoted solely to the
topic.
   But the only education issue that really caught on in this
campaign was one that the next president will have no say over:
whether public school teachers should be compelled to lead the
Pledge of Allegiance at the start of each school day.
   Bush made political hay over Dukakis' 1977 veto of a mandatory
pledge bill that the Mernor thought was
unconstitutional.
   Educators remain confident that regardless of who winsassachusetts
gov, the next
president will not propose the massive cuts in school aid and
support for college students that Ronald Reagan sought.
   But they say neither Bush nor Dukakis has done enough to
dramatize the problems facing American schools or spelled out a
convincing plan to improve performance.
   Bush, the Republican, tells voters wherever he goes that better
schools are the key to a better future for America.
   Dukakis, the Democrat backed by both teachers' unions, 
valued and honored profession again.''
   Education ``faded as a central issue,'' said Ernest L. Boyer,
president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
   ``We hear strong inspirational statements ... but the direction
the `education president' would take is still not clear,'' he said.
   Richard Berendzen, president of The American University in
Washington, said both candidates deserve ``a D-plus'' on education.
   Berendzen said 25 percent of American youths drop out of high
school and 20 percent grow up in poverty, and the United States
often pulls up the rear on international scholastic tests.
   ``If you take a sober look at the matter, you could say that the
preparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year
2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing America,'' said
Berendzen.
   Despite the generalities, said College Board President Donald M.
Stewart, ``It is obvious both candidates are making the link between
economic productivity and international competitiveness and the
underserved, undereducated poor.''
   Dennis Doyle, a Hudson Institute scholar, said it is inevitable
that education will slip to the back of the president's agenda.
   ``Education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president will
actually keep, as apart from a campaign list,'' said Doyle. ``The
deficit, defense, international relations, economic problems, even
health care, Social Security, transportation and housing all are
higher on their priority list.''
   While American business leaders ``have themselves in an absolute
lather about education'' and there is ``an enormous reservoir of
public interest'' in the schools, Doyle said, ``it's hard to imagine
what kind of federal role you would craft given all the other
demands on the president's time and on the budget.''
   Both have outlined ways to help families cope with the soaring
costs of college _ Bush with a tax-free savings bond plan, and
Dukakis with a new loan program that students would repay through
payroll deductions.
   Bush, whose administration tried to cut $5 billion from the
Education Department last year, actually has proposed bigger
spending increases than his rival.
   Here are their major education proposals:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ $500 million for a ``Merit Schools'' program that would reward
schools that raise the academic scores of disadvantaged students.
Schools would get up to $100,000 each to spend as they saw fit.
   _ $50 million for matching grants to create more ``magnet''
schools that emphasize various academic subjects.
   _ Expanding from $12 million to $50 million a proposed Fund for
Innovation and Reform of Schools and Teaching to give each state $1
million for an experimental district trying such concepts as
parental choice, merit pay or year-round schools.
   _ Funds for Head Start, the $1.2 billion pre-school program for
disadvantaged children, would be increased by $250 million and up to
$1 billion over four years. Bush said he is commited to building
Head Start ``to a level where all eligible 4-year-olds can attend
classes.'' The Children's Defense Fund says the 453,000 children now
in Head Start are only 16 percent of those eligible. Bush wants to
add places for 350,000 4-year-olds.
   Bush has also promised to spend more on Chapter 1, a $4.6 billion
remedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligible poor
students.
   Congress recently passed legislation that makes good on another
Bush campaign promise: tax-free interest on U.S. Savings Bonds for
college tuition, starting in 1990. The tax break would be phased out
for couples with adjusted gross incomes between $60,000 and $90,000,
and for single parents between $40,000 and $55,000.
   Bush also would spend $100 million to support youth service and
volunteer activities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ $250 million for a National Teaching Excellence Fund to provide
college scholarships and forgive loans for those who become
teachers, launch a new National Teacher Corps, create state teacher
retraining centers, recruit retirees to teach, and a fivefold
expansion of a $1.9 million Christa McAuliffe Fellowship program for
talented teachers.
   _ $25 million for a ``Citizens Literacy Corps'' to support
volunteer efforts to teach illiterates to read.
   _ A ``Student Tuition and Repayment System'' (STARS) that would
allow students to pay back college loans through payroll deductions
in their working years. It would supplement, not replace, existing
federal grant and loan programs, at least at the start.
   Students would obtain the STARS loans from banks, but the
government would collect the payroll taxes to replenish the loan
funds. Dukakis officials have suggested a payback rate of one-eighth
to one-quarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per $1,000
borrowed, meaning a tax of 2.5 percent to 5 percent for a $20,000
borrower.
   The rate stays the same for low- and high-income earners. The tax
would be applied on income up to the level taxed by Social Security
(currently $45,000). The Dukakis plan would allow borrowers to buy
out their loan commitment at any time.

<HEAD>Dukakis Backs Universal Health Insurance, Bush Would Expand
Medicaid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis has made a promise of universal
health insurance a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, and
George Bush wants to expand Medicaid coverage for the poor.
   But both candidates have shied away from detailed prescriptions
for a host of other intractable medical problems that will confront
the next president, from the AIDS crisis to long-term care to the
soaring costs of Medicare.
   ``Health care is an issue that most Americans are very concerned
about, and the candidates have not spent a lot of time on it,'' said
John Rother, legislative director for the American Association of
Retired Persons.
   Although neither Bush nor Dukakis has owned up to it, the $87
billion Medicare program _ which provides health insurance for 28
million elderly and 3 million disabled workers _ is almost certain
to be a prime target of deficit-reduction efforts in the next
Congress.
   Physicians' fees under Medicare have risen at a 15 percent annual
clip, and Congress is already studying ways to move away from the
traditional method of reimbursing doctors for whatever their
customary charges are.
   ``They've been rather quiet about what they would do with
Medicare. Our concern on Medicare is that you can't keep ratcheting
that program down and expect access for the elderly to continue,''
said Jack Owen, executive vice president of the American Hospital
Association.
   But health analyst Jack Meyer said, ``The next administration, if
they're serious about budget control, has to put health care on the
table.''
   Americans spent $497 billion on health care in 1987, or 11.2
percent of the gross national product, a far larger share of GNP
than spent by any other industrialized country.
   Still, 37 million Americans have no health insurance. Most of
them are in the workforce or depending on someone who holds a job
but has no insurance. They are not old enough for Medicare nor, in
most cases, poor enough for Medicaid.
   The ranks of the uninsured have soared over the past decade as
insurance premiums surged in step with medical charges and as jobs
with extensive fringe benefits disappeared in industries such as
manufacturing.
   Hospitals and physicians once shifted the cost of caring for the
uninsured onto those who could pay. But in recent years, both the
government and third-party insurers such as Blue Cross have balked
at shouldering that burden.
   ``The paying patients are driving much harder bargains,'' said
Meyer, president of a research firm called New Directions for
Policy. ``It's much harder to bury these costs in somebody else's
bill.''
   Here is a look at the candidates' positions on uninsured people,
long-term care and AIDS.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE UNINSURED</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis, calling it a disgrace that the United States is the only
industrialized country other than South Africa without universal
health insurance, proposes to help 22 million of the uninsured by
backing legislation to order all but the smallest employers to
arrange health insurance.
   Dukakis has also called for a $100 million program to provide
medical and nutritional care to 200,000 pregnant women who lack
insurance or Medicaid coverage.
   ``I want to make sure that quality, affordable health care is the
birthright of every family and citizen in this land,'' says the
Massachusetts governor, whose state last April began requiring
health insurance with most jobs.
   While Dukakis has said this requirement would not cost the
federal Treasury anything, Bush has labeled it a $35 billion tax on
business that could force thousands out of work.
   The vice president says he wants to allow poor people to buy into
the $32 billion Medicaid program, which now covers 24 million of the
needy.
   He has not offered specifics, but Bush promises to press for
mandatory Medicaid coverage for all children living in poverty,
starting with infants. However, Bush's ``Invest in Our Children''
package apparently includes only $200 million to $300 million more
for Medicaid.
   The Republican would phase in ``affordable coverage for pregnant
women and infants up to 185 percent'' of the poverty line, and
eventually cover older children as well, according to a position
paper.
   Medicaid now covers less than half of all poor children, leaving
11 million unprotected. A law already on the books requires states
to cover poor infants up to age 1 by July 1990.
   Medicaid coverage is not cheap.
   Meyer estimated it would cost $8 billion to $9 billion to cover
all uninsured poor people.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LONG TERM CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With 1.5 million people in nursing homes costing $20,000 or more
a year, long-term care is one of the biggest worries for older
Americans and their families.
   Bush has proposed tax incentives to encourage people to buy their
own long-term-care group insurance and allowing people to convert
their IRAs, savings accounts and life insurance to pay nursing home
bills.
   For those who cannot afford insurance, Bush favors easing
Medicaid requirements so they don't have to spend their life savings
before becoming eligible.
   Dukakis has endorsed Rep. Claude Pepper's $7 billion-a-year plan
to provide first-dollar coverage of long-term care at home.
   Pepper, the Florida Democrat, would pay for this coverage by
levying the 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare on all wages
instead of ending it at $45,000, effectively raising the payroll tax
for 8 million workers.
   Dukakis has suggested guaranteeing Medicaid coverage for those
who first exhaust private long-term insurance benefits.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush says ``we may have to spend even more'' than the current $1
billion budget for the fight against the deadly virus, but ``money
alone won't stop AIDS.'' He says education is crucial, including
giving students the facts ``in a thoughtful, sensitive manner.'' He
favors allowing those with the AIDS virus to stay in school or on
the job.
   Bush supports legislation ``that would make it a crime to
discriminate against AIDS patients and those infected with the
virus.'' He said AIDS test results must be kept ``appropriately
confidential.''
   Dukakis supports a $1 billion-plus AIDS research and education
budget, as well as anti-discrimination legislation.
   ``As president, I will educate the public about both the facts
and the myths of this terrible disease,'' he said. Children should
be taught about the disease as part of ``a comprehensive health
education program beginnning in the early grades.''

<HEAD>Bush Paints Improving Rural Picture; Dukakis Sees Economy Still
Ailing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many American farmers have endured tough times
during the Reagan era, capped by a withering drought that played
havoc with crops in this election year.
   But that same drought has driven up prices and mopped up
surpluses, and that could strengthen Republican George Bush's appeal
for farm votes that many politicians thought once were locked up for
Michael Dukakis and the Democrats.
   In agriculture, Bush sees a rural America on the mend and headed
for greater prosperity built around a free-market philosophy.
   Dukakis sees a rural economy still seriously ailing and in need
of government help to support the family farmer and guarantee
reasonable prices for crops.
   ``The difference between the two is Bush is happy. We think
there's a crisis still out there,'' said Ted Mondale, Midwest
political director for Dukakis.
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a Bush agricultural adviser, called
the Dukakis program ``a big mystery that is causing anxiety in farm
country.''
   ``They seem to be in favor of massive cutbacks in production,''
Cochran charged.
   The Democratic nominee has not endorsed the stringent production
controls that two farm state Democrats, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, have sought. Their bill died in
the 100th Congress.
   Mondale said Dukakis supports the concept, but not the
particulars, of the Harkin-Gephardt legislation.
   Dukakis, in his position paper on agriculture, said U.S. farm
policy ``must include a combination of supply management and
reasonable price supports in a way that makes it possible for family
farmers to earn a decent living from the land.''
   While Bush often refers derisively to Dukakis' ``supply
management'' ideas, the 1985 Farm Bill that Bush lavishly praises
also gave the government supply management powers, and Mondale said
the Reagan administration's price supports and set-asides were all
supply management tools.
   Bush has said the bipartisan 1985 farm law is just beginning to
pay off for farmers. It has led to lower commodity prices which,
coupled with the drop in the dollar's value, helped boost farm
exports 18 percent last year, he says. And he boasts that net cash
farm income last year was a record $57 billion.
   ``Rural America has been strongly tested in recent years.
However, I believe we have seen the bottom and are headed back up,''
says Bush.
   The vice president says he would press ahead with efforts ``to
phase out over a reasonable period those subsidies that distort
agricultural trade if, and only if, other countries do the same.''
But he promises to ``preserve a true safety net to ensure the
viability of the family farm and rural America.''
   Dukakis says farmers and ranchers are ``being squeezed at both
ends,'' facing lower commodity prices and a shrinking share of each
food dollar (down from 32 percent in 1976 to 25 percent now).
   ``Still lower prices are not the answer,'' the Democrat argues.
``Our present policy seems to be guided by a desire to drive
commodity prices lower and lower in the hope of some future recovery
of lost markets.''
   Dukakis promises to target farm program benefits to family
farmers ``who need them most.''
   Dukakis hopes to narrow the federal deficit by reducing farm
subsidies. In his last debate with Bush, the Massachusetts governor
said he was sure a Dukakis administration could ``give our farm
families a decent income without spending $20-to-$25 billion a year
in farm subsidies.''
   Farm subsidies shot up from $5 billion in 1980 under the Carter
administration to $25 billion in 1986 under Reagan. This year the
administration and Congress came up with nearly $4 billion in
emergency drought aid.
   But the drought-fed higher crop prices also reduce the need for
government price supports.
   Mondale, son of the former vice president, said ruefully that
Bush was claiming credit for higher prices and exports that really
belong ``to the weather and the Democrats.'' Farm state legislators,
most of them Democrats, had to ``shove the export enhancement
program down the Reagan administration's throat,'' he said.
   Bush constantly reminds rural audiences of the Carter
administration's 1979 grain embargo against the Soviet Union and
implies that Dukakis is liable to try another. Bush promises he
won't ``use farmers and ranchers and their families as foreign
policy pawns.''
   But Dukakis says, ``In no instance would I impose an embargo.''
   Dukakis says the productivity of U.S. farmers ``should be viewed
as a blessing, not a curse. Surplus farm commodities should be
better used to feed hungry people both at home and abroad.'' He
favors barter with countries ``that want our farm goods but don't
have the needed currency.''
   Bush has promised to devote an economic summit meeting with the
major U.S. allies to the subject of agriculture.
   Both candidates support wider use of ethanol, the alternative
fuel made from gasoline and alcohol.
   Dukakis has also promised help for ailing rural hospitals and
other steps to revitalize rural communities.
   Bush suggests rural enterprise zones to help distressed
communities.
   Whether rural America perceives its own glass as half-full or
half-empty may decide which candidate wins the farm state vote.
   ``There's a lot of optimism in agriculture today compared with
several years ago when huge surpluses were hanging over the
market,'' said Cochran. With inflation under control and interest
rates at least stable, ``farmers are feeling they may be able to
work their way clear of some indebtedness.''
   Mondale said, ``The key to this election is whether we can get
Mike Dukakis' ag program out so that people on Main Street
understand it and see that it's a reasonable one.''

<HEAD>Emotional Issues Rule the Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a down and dirty presidential
campaign, from gleeful Democratic denunciations of George Bush in
Atlanta as a wimp to the Republicans' skewering of Michael Dukakis
over crime, the ACLU and his veto of a mandatory Pledge of
Allegiance bill.
   While the dismal tenor of this year's campaign discourse has
elicited groans from past presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter,
political analysts credit Bush with tapping some of the same
emotional issues that helped Nixon capture the White House in 1968
and 1972 and laid the groundwork for Ronald Reagan's twin landslides
of the 1980s.
   And some experts say it is a serious mistake for the Democrats,
who lost four of the past five presidential elections, to
underestimate the seriousness with which the electorate responds to
emotional appeals to its patriotism or fear of crime.
   The gut issues, symbolic or not, are real issues for many voters.
   ``Politics is a matter of gut responses, otherwise known as
emotions,'' said Roger D. Masters, a Dartmouth University professor
of government.
   ``It's not just media manipulation,'' said Michael Robinson, a
Georgetown University associate professor of government and expert
on media and politics. ``If the Democrats continue to believe that
symbolic issues don't matter, they're going to foul up time and time
again.''
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said
the symbolic issues loom larger in this election because ``American
politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum. The candidates seemed quite
deliberately to choose not to face up to the pragmatic issues.''
   Robinson said the race unfolded in a time of economic prosperity
when there were really few differences between the Democrats and
Republicans on dealing with the Soviet Union.
   ``When you subtract the issues of peace and prosperity, you leave
very little, so we are left to fight on those gut issues,'' he said.
   Analyst Kevin Phillips, publisher of the American Political
Report, said, ``The Republicans have replayed the key cultural and
patriotic issues with the swing voters that got the Republican
presidential majority started in 1968 and 1972 and 1980.''
   By flogging the crime spree of Willie Horton, the Massachusetts
lifer who escaped while on a weekend furlough from prison, and
pummeling Dukakis for being a self-proclaimed card-carrying member
of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Bush campaign succeeded
in rekindling in the minds of wavering Reagan Democrats the emotions
that ``pulled them to vote for Republican presidents in earlier
years,'' said Phillips.
   In their final debate Oct. 13, both candidates sounded apologetic
about the low-road campaigning. Bush, recalling the almost non-stop
attacks the Democrats unleashed on him at their July convention in
Atlanta, said, ``I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard
(but) he started it.''
   ``It was both ways,'' said Ben Wattenberg, an American Enterprise
Institute senior fellow. ``Two months ago, the best issue that
Dukakis had on Bush was `wimp' and the best issue Bush had on
Dukakis was `L-word' (liberal).''
   The Republicans ``went after Dukakis on all the L-word stuff,
which they had some nice symbols for _ prison furloughs and Pledge
of Allegiance and ACLU and stuff like that. But it wasn't about
those issues,'' said Wattenberg. ``The reason they played was
because they resonated in terms of 20 years of Democratic party
history as too liberal.''
   ``It's not a small issue. It is haunting this party,'' said
Wattenberg, a Democrat. ``It is which direction the plurality party
in America wants to take the country.''
   On the other hand, the Democrats' wimp charge quickly lost its
punch as Bush emerged from the GOP convention in New Orleans as
``Captain Marvel,'' said Wattenberg.
   Phillips said, ``By going hard-line on the cultural and patriotic
issues, Bush drove down the wimp factor. ... Bush put on a bit of a
John Wayne outfit.''
   He added that the Democrats failed to develop rival issues to
appeal to the same swing voters. Bush's highest negative rating in
polls remains the perception that he is too close to the rich and
too far from the middle class.
   But Dukakis has been unable to ``come on hard and tough and use
economic populism and nationalism to get the guys in the bar in the
ethnic sections of Cleveland or your dirt farmer in rural Alabama
angry at the Republicans,'' said Phillips.
   Robinson said, ``In a time of real prosperity, questions of
economic justice and hostility toward big business do not cut it
with the American public.''
   ``You can't pretend that something that is an issue is not an
issue. It hurts the Democrats when they try to dismiss this in some
way as bigotry or tasteless or unAmerican,'' said Robinson.
   ``It is an issue to Americans whether you wear your flag on your
sleeve or whether you wear it on the seat of your pants. Republicans
are not only willing to wear their flag on their sleeves, they're
willing to wear it on their foreheads. The Democrats are willing to
move it off their keister, but they still want to keep it half
covered, and Americans don't like that,'' said the Georgetown
professor.
   Hess invoked a memory of a childhood pastime to explain why
emotional issues have been so prominent in this race.
   ``You could compare the whole of American campaigns to the
children's game of rock, paper and scissors,'' he said. ```Rocks are
always the politics-ain't-beanbag issues, the tough gut, hard
campaign. That's always there in American politics.
   ``But it's covered when there are particularly attractive
candidates. Candidates that catch the imagination are
paper-covering-rock. When you have overarching issues _ war or
peace, prosperity or recession _ that's scissors. That cuts paper,''
he explained.
   ``Here we've got a campaign in which there are no overarching
issues, so take away scissors. There are no attractive candidates,
so take away paper.
   ``What are you left with? Rock.''

<HEAD>Good Jobs At Good Wages Are In The Eye Of The Beholder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to all-important pocketbook
issues, George Bush and Michael Dukakis seem to be describing
different countries.
   Bush's America is one whose citizens enjoy unprecedented
prosperity, with 17.8 million new jobs created over the past six
years.
   ``Good jobs at good wages,'' the Republican says, swiping
Dukakis' own tag line.
   Dukakis, however, describes a far different America, where wages
are stagnating and ``the rich have gotten richer, the poor have
gotten poorer and those in the middle _ and that means most of us _
are getting squeezed.''
   The basic argument is over whether high-paying factory jobs are
being replaced by low-paying jobs in the service sector. Reagan
critics contend that too many of those 17.8 million new jobs involve
flipping hamburgers or other low-paid work.
   In a 1986 study done for Congress, liberal economists Barry
Bluestone and Bennett Harrison argued that ``America may be on the
verge of losing its middle class.''
   The two professors reached the startling conclusion that nearly
three-fifths of the jobs created during the Reagan years paid less
than $7,000. By contrast, such low-wage jobs represented just
one-fifth of new jobs during the pre-Reagan 1963-79 period, the
authors said.
   ``New, lower-paid service jobs just won't support a family. For
every new job in Silicon Valley or Wall Street, with high pay and
perks, there are many more jobs in the (shopping) mall that don't
pay much more than minimum wage,'' Bluestone and Bennett write in a
new book, ``The Great U-Turn.''
   A study in September by the Democratic-controlled Senate Budget
Committee reached a similar conclusion.
   ``The dominant trend in American job creation during the 1980s
has been for low-paying jobs to replace those which provided a
middle-class standard of living.'' the report said. ``Only 38
percent of the increase in employment (since 1979) was in
middle-wage jobs.''
   Republicans counter that the Democrats' studies slant their
results by counting not only full-time jobs but also part-time
employment, lowering average pay.
   When part-time jobs are excluded, the statistics show the bulk of
job growth has been in the middle, say the Republicans.
   They point to a recent study by two Bureau of Labor Statistics
economists who concluded the ``middle,'' defined as earnings between
$20,000 and $60,000, is indeed shrinking but that virtually all of
the families leaving it have moved up, not down.
   The Republicans brag that by almost all measures the Reagan
record looks better than the Jimmy Carter years, when rapid
inflation eroded earnings. The Bush campaign says median family
incomes, after adjusting for inflation, have risen 10 percent during
the Reagan years after falling 7 percent from 1977 to 1981.
   But Dukakis calls it ``a two-paycheck prosperity.'' Income is up
only because of a dramatic increase in the number of wives forced to
work as cash-strapped families struggle to maintain their standard
of living, he argues.
   ``All across America, we see two parents working harder and
harder to buy what one income could buy before,'' the Massachusetts
governor says.
   And even with more family members working, the median family
income last year of $30,853 merely got Americans back to where they
were in 1973.
   Economists cite several factors for this development.
   First, the country absorbed large numbers of new workers entering
the labor force in the 1970s as the baby boom generation reached
maturity. Young, inexperienced workers were a drag on productivity
and competed with each other for jobs, holding down wages.
   From 1949 to 1973, non-farm productivity rose 2.5 percent a year.
Since rising productivity provides the room for wages to grow
without fueling inflation, median family incomes roughly doubled.
   By contrast, productivity growth from 1974 through 1980 averaged
a mediocre 0.4 percent a year.
   In addition, salaries in the late 1970s were jolted by
double-digit inflation caused by oil-price increases. Then in the
mid-1980s, workers in American industries lost ground to stiff
foreign competition as the soaring value of the dollar opened the
country to a flood of imports and priced American products out of
overseas markets.
   Many economists see signs that these unfavorable trends are being
reversed. They predict better wage gains in the 1990s, regardless of
who wins the White House.
   Productivity in the 1980s has been rising 1.4 percent a year and
the Labor Department estimates the labor force will grow in the
1990s at less than half the pace of the peak years of the 1970s when
baby boomers flooded the job market.
   This will mean a return to the labor scarcity that helped boost
wages in the 1950s.
   The drop in oil prices has helped hold inflation down and a
weaker dollar has helped revive U.S. manufacturers.
   But rosy predictions for the future haven't tempered the debate
over the past eight years.
   The Democrats note that, despite the longest peacetime economic
recovery on record, 13.5 percent of Americans were living in poverty
last year, compared with 11.7 percent in the Carter year of 1979.
   They point to Census Bureau statistics showing that the share of
total income going to the richest fifth of American families
increased to 43.7 percent in 1987, compared to 41.6 percent in 1980.
The share of income going to the poorest fifth fell to 4.6 percent
in 1987, compared to 5.1 percent in 1980.
   But with the economy growing since 1984 and unemployment hovering
near 14-year lows, Republicans say the pocketbook issues voters care
about, jobs and low inflation, are going to help the GOP.
   ``The answer is very clear that the average worker is indeed
better off,'' said Marvin Kosters, an economist with the
conservative American Enterprise Institute.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Differ on Reasons For Soviet Shifts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush is running for president
on his extensive foreign policy credentials and on the strength of
the Reagan administration's triumph in signing a nuclear arms treaty
with the Soviet Union.
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, who cannot match his rival's
experience, instead attacks Bush's judgment and challenges the
administration's right to claim any credit for the Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan or the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Dukakis supports the negotiated ban on medium-range nuclear
missiles and endorses the goal of a 50 percent reduction in
long-range missiles in U.S.-Soviet talks at Geneva. But he
attributes the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's recognition of his country's economic
failures, not to President Reagan's military buildup and get-tough
stance toward the Soviets.
   Both presidential candidates would be certain to press ahead with
arms control talks and try to build on the momentum achieved in the
four Reagan-Gorbachev summits.
   Although Dukakis has accused the Reagan administration of
mishandling Middle East policy and waiting until the twilight of its
term to seek a breakthrough there, neither Dukakis nor Bush has
spelled out any major initiatives to bring the Arabs and Israelis
together.
   Both have assured Israel of continued U.S. support. Dukakis has
endorsed shifting the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a
move that administration officials fear could undermine progress
toward an Arab-Israeli settlement.
   But in such troublespots as Nicaragua and South Africa, Dukakis
is committed to changing the policies adopted by Reagan and
championed by Bush.
   Bush supports renewed aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
Dukakis calls Reagan's Central American policies ``a fiasco'' and
vehemently opposes Contra aid, favoring instead the diplomatic peace
plan of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   On South Africa, Dukakis promises to press for tougher
international sanctions against the apartheid regime. Bush says
further sanctions would only hurt black workers. Dukakis also
opposes U.S. aid for the South African-backed rebels in Angola,
while Bush supports it.
   The Democratic nominee says the United States should work with
its allies and through international organizations rather than go it
alone. He has said the NATO allies and Japan must bear a larger
share of the common defense.
   Bush, a former ambassador to the United Nations, says, ``You've
got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand
for freedom and democracy around the world, and we can't turn it
over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.''
   Bush cites the INF treaty, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan
and the tentative end of the Iran-Iraq war as vindication of the
administration's ``peace through strength'' philosophy.
   For the vice president, that means pressing ahead with
development and eventual deployment of Star Wars, or the Strategic
Defense Initiative, which Dukakis once ridiculed as a fantasy.
   It also means pounding Dukakis for opposing both the mobile MX
and Midgetman missiles. ``The Soviets are modernizing. They continue
to modernize. And we can't simply say, `We've got enough nuclear
weapons. Let's freeze,''' Bush said.
   Dukakis favored a nuclear freeze in the early 1980s when the
Reagan administration persuaded nervous allies in Western Europe to
accept Pershing II and cruise missiles to counter the Soviet's own
medium-range weapons.
   The governor has said the 13,000 nuclear weapons in the U.S.
arsenal and the 9,000 stockpiled by the Soviets are enough to blow
each country up ``40 times over.''
   But Dukakis supports the Stealth or B-2 bomber, which rolls off
the assembly line in late November, and backs the new generation of
nuclear missiles for the Trident submarine.
   Bush has said his approach toward the Soviet Union ``would avoid
swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated pessimism.''
Dukakis speaks of trying to ``drive the agenda with the Soviet
Union'' instead of following Gorbachev's lead.
   Bush has visited 74 foreign countries as vice president. He was
envoy to China and director of central intelligence as well as
ambassador to the United Nations.
   ``I don't think we should risk turning over the leadership and
security of this free world of ours to a man with literally no
experience in foreign affairs,'' Bush recently told voters in South
River, N.J.
   ``It's not the length of your resume,'' counters Dukakis. ``It's
your strength, it's your values, the quality of the people you pick.
It's your understanding of the forces of change in a sweeping new
world.''
   Dukakis has questioned Bush's judgment in not trying to block the
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran. He says Bush must share the blame
for dealing with Panamana's military leader, Manuel Noriega, now
under indictment for alleged involvement in drug trafficking. He
criticized Bush for once toasting then-Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos for ``your adherence to democratic principles.''
   Dukakis supports a mutual ban on testing and deployment of
anti-satellite weapons and a prohibition of all underground nuclear
tests.
   Bush supports the administration's controversial, broad
interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile or ABM treaty, a move
intended to leave room for testing Star Wars. Dukakis favors the
original, narrow interpretation.
   Bush says he wants the world to adopt and enforce a total ban on
chemical and biological weapons. Dukakis scoffs at that, saying that
Bush cast tie-breaking Senate votes in favor of resuming production
of chemical weapons.
   Bush has accused Dukakis of opposing the U.S. invasion of Grenada
in 1983 and the 1986 strike against Libya. The Democrat denies the
charge.
   Dukakis hedged his support on both occasions. He said the Grenada
invasion was justified if the lives of American students were at
stake, and the Libyan raid was proper if its aim was to hit
terrorist bases and not to assassinate Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

<HEAD>Next Administration Must Cope With Huge Trade Imbalance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the federal budget deficit seems invisible
to most Americans, the gaping trade deficit is all too apparent.
They see its evidence every day in the cars they drive, the
televisions they watch, the shoes they wear.
   Now it will fall to either George Bush or Michael Dukakis to try
to remedy this other U.S. deficit, the trade imbalances that hit a
staggering $170 billion last year and are running at a $138 billion
pace for 1988.
   The American appetite for imported goods became voracious in the
1980s as a strong dollar produced a flood of bargains for U.S.
consumers. Even when the dollar took a nosedive after intervention
by the United States and its allies in 1985, Americans retained
their taste for imports.
   Japanese automakers who established a beachhead in the U.S.
market with cheap, fuel-efficient subcompacts earned a larger and
more expensive niche on the strength of their autos' quality and
reliability.
   The trade law signed by President Reagan in August gives the next
president new tools to protect American markets and retaliate
against countries with unfair trading practices.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, was the
leading congressional champion of the tougher trade law.
   ``I want to be a president who stands up and fights for American
companies, American products and American workers,'' Dukakis said at
a metal factory in Dayton, Ohio, last month.
   Bush says American exports are booming, the trade deficit is
already coming down, and free trade, not protectionism, is the way
to restore America's competitiveness. The Republican dismisses
Dukakis' warnings about foreign ownership as ``protectionist
demagoguery.''
   ``We need to increase our exports, not shut our borders,'' says
Bush. But, he adds, ``our commitment to free trade must be linked to
a reciprocal commitment to fair trade by our trading partners.''
   Dukakis, while trying to make a gut-level appeal to American
workers alarmed about their livelihood, has tried to avoid being
cast as a protectionist.
   Dukakis stayed conspicuously silent when Congress passed a
protectionist textile bill in September that Reagan vetoed.
   But even Reagan is not the doctrinaire free-trader he once was.
   His administration, confronted with gaping trade deficits, backed
off from what had been an undeviating faith in free markets in 1985
and worked in concert with allies to bring the value of the dollar
down. That effort was orchestrated by James Baker III, then-Treasury
secretary and now Bush campaign chairman.
   ``There's been very vigorous enforcement of trade laws under the
Reagan-Bush administration in the past three years,'' said Bruce
Smart, a Bush trade adviser and former undersecretary of commerce.
   Dukakis says the Reagan-Bush policies in those first four years
``turned two generations of trade surpluses into the world's largest
trade deficit, and cost our workers 5 million jobs.''
   But Smart notes both Bush and Dukakis support the U.S.-Canada
free trade agreement and favor strengthening the 96-nation General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which sets global trading
rules and investigates alleged violations.
   Dukakis has endorsed extending voluntary restraint agreements
with 29 steel-exporting countries after those agreements expire next
Sept. 30. Bush has withheld judgment, waiting ``to see if there is a
better way'' to help U.S. steel companies at a disadvantage from
subsidized imports, Smart said.
   Both Bush and Dukakis supported the unfair trade complaint that
American rice growers lodged against Japan.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter rejected that
complaint last Friday, prompting the Dukakis campaign to accuse the
administration of failing to ``stand up for America.''
   Economist David Wyss said, ``It's quite clear Bush would continue
current policies, sticking as much as possible with multilateral
accords and keeping an open economy. ... Dukakis feels that
interference with trade is justifiable to protect American
industry.''
   ``There is no easy way out,'' said Robert Strauss, who was trade
negotiator for the Carter administration.
   ``It's going to take strong direction from the president leading
the way (with) the bully pulpit,'' said Strauss. ``You must do a lot
of things, including strike some global bargains with the Europeans
and Japanese.''
   William Beeman, a vice president of the Committee for Economic
Development, a business group, said, ``The most important thing you
can do for the trade deficit is reduce the budget deficit.''
   Foreign investors lured by high interest rates bought up much of
the Treasury debt that financed the Reagan budget deficits. That in
turn helped drive up the dollar's value and made it harder for U.S.
manufacturers to compete abroad.
   Bush looks to farm exports to help restore the trade balance, and
promises to make agriculture a prime topic at the next economic
summit with U.S. allies.
   Dukakis has pledged to wipe out the trade deficit in four years,
without fully spelling out how. The most important step is to reduce
the federal deficit, he says.
   Both candidates agree better education is a key to improving U.S.
productivity and competitiveness.
   Dukakis says he would insist on reciprocity from such U.S.
trading partners as Japan, South Korea, West Germany and Brazil that
restrict American imports while they ``flood'' the U.S. with
products.
   But in an earlier position paper, the Democrat also cautioned
against erecting trade barriers, saying, ``If every barrier to
American goods abroad disappeared tomorrow, we would still have a
trade deficit of $125 billion.''
   Wyss, chief economist of Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.,
said the new trade law is ``a potential disaster in the wrong
hands.''
   ``It's really a protectionist measure, but it gives the president
a great deal of leeway to shortcircuit that,'' Wyss said.
   The first sign of the next administration's intentions may come
next April when the law requires the U.S. trade representative to
produce a list of targeted countries along with a plan for
negotiations to remove trade barriers.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Both Likely To Boost Help For Poor Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush says he is ``almost haunted'' by
the plight of inner-city children. Michael Dukakis speaks of the
torment of parents who cannot afford health insurance for their
children.
   Both candidates agree that far too many children are growing up
poor, and both promise to do something about it.
   Skeptics say that for all their visits to day care centers,
Republican Bush and Democrat Dukakis have never spelled out how they
would attack the child care problem.
   But others are heartened that the candidates are talking about
child care, infant mortality and high school dropouts, and are
confident that the next president and a new Congress will give
higher priority to easing the plight of millions of American
children.
   Nearly 13 million children _ 1 in every 5 _ are growing up in
poverty, according to the Census Bureau.
   After dramatic progress in the 1960s, the child poverty rate
soared from 13.8 percent in 1969 to 22.2 percent in the recession
year of 1983. It has leveled off at slightly more than 20 percent in
recent years.
   Medicaid, the federal-state insurance plan for the poor, covers
only half of these children.
   Forty thousand American infants die before their first birthday,
and progress has slowed in reducing the infant mortality rate. The
United States, which had the sixth lowest rate in the world in 1955,
now ranks 19th.
   ``The only reason we haven't seen action on these issues is that
children don't vote. For too long in the political process, children
have been seen but not heard,'' says Robert Sweeney, president of
the National Association of Children's Hospitals.
   Education statistics are equally bleak.
   Head Start, the $1.2 billion preschool program for the
disadvantaged, reaches fewer than 20 percent of its target group.
Chapter One, the $4.6 billion remedial effort to help youngsters
falling behind in school work, reaches barely half.
   More than 26 percent of teen-agers leave high school without a
diploma. Drugs, gangs, crime and homelessness all make the poverty
trap even deeper.
   ``I find myself almost haunted by the lives being lived by the
children of our inner cities,'' Bush said recently.
   His response is a $3.7 billion ``Invest in Our Children''
initiative which includes a $1,000-per-child tax credit to
low-income working families with children under age 4, as well as
expanded Head Start and Medicaid coverage.
   Dukakis makes an even bigger promise: making basic health care a
birthright for all Americans, primarily by requiring employers to
provide basic health insurance coverage for workers and their
families.
   Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund,
said, ``I welcome the fact that they oth recognize that you'vegot to
deal with enormous gaps in preventive health services for mothers
and babies. The question now is translating that into money and
actual programs.''
   Edelman was disappointed at Congress' failure this year to pass
the $2.5 billion ``A Better Child'' child care bill that Dukakis and
many Democrats favored. The ABC bill would have set minimum
standards and funneled grants to states to help low- and
middle-income families with child care.
   Dukakis backed the ABC concept, but committed himself only to
start-up funds, not the full $2.5 billion.
   Bush proposed a $2.2 billion alternative, hinged on the $1,000
``toddler tax credit'' for low-income working families who would get
the credit whether or not they actually paid for child care.
   Bush accused Dukakis and the Democrats of wanting to ``license
grandmothers'' and impose burdensome federal regulations on child
care.
   Thomas D. Herman, deputy national issues director for the Dukakis
campaign, said, ``Bush's proposal does nothing to create new child
care slots. ... It doesn't even go halfway toward paying for the
child care that's needed.''
   Dukakis says his plan to require employer-paid basic health
insurance for workers would cover almost two-thirds of the 37
million American children and adults who lack insurance.
   For those still uncovered, Dukakis proposes a $100 million
prenatal and nutritional program for 200,000 pregnant women in
families up to 200 percent of the poverty line.
   Bush oposes mandatory health insurance on the job, but he
supports requiring all states to provide Medicaid coverage for all
children in families with incomes below the poverty line.
   Bush supports phasing in ``affordable coverage'' for pregnant
women and infants up to 185 percent of the poverty level. He has
suggested sliding-scale premiums and allowing people to ``buy into
Medicaid,'' a concept he has not explained fully.
   Most states already cover poor infants and, under existing law,
all must cover pregnant women and infants up to 100 percent o the
poverty level starting July 1, 1990.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said, ``Bush's numbers don't add up.
It's not enough to talk about being a kinder and gentler nation. You
also have to pay for it.''
   But Deborah Steelman, Bush's domestic issues adviser, said the
vice president has not promised more than he can deliver.
   With Head Start, a program that serves 454,000 pre-kindergarten
children ages 3 to 5, the vice president promises to expand it so it
is big enough to reach all eligible 4-year-olds but not all the
other preschoolers.
   Steelman said age 4 is ``the critical year when they are most
likely to absorb true, developmental skills.''
   ``We are targeted to get results. These are not just blanket,
cover-everybody proposals,'' Steelman said. She estimates that
Bush's plan would add $1 billion and 350,000 children to the Head
Start budget over four years.

<HEAD>KNOXVILLE: White said.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``When I looked at the average amount that utilities were
spending from 1978 to 1984 and then I looked at what TVA was
spending, we were underspending everyone else,'' he said.
   ``That meant we were either a lot more efficient _ and I didn't
see any signs of that _ or we were underfunded. I think we were
underfunded.''
   As White prepares to leave TVA, saying he wants to devote more
time to his family in Virginia, Sequoyah Unit 2 is back on line,
Unit 1 is on the verge of returning to operation and Browns Ferry
Unit 2 is scheduled to be producing power again next spring.
   But none of this was accomplished without controversy. First,
there was his $355,200 annual salary, paid under a personal services
contract that allowed TVA to bypass the federal employee salary cap,
then $72,300 a year. It costs money to get good nuclear talent,
White has said, commenting on his pay and that of contractors he's
hired.
   Still unresolved is his statement to the NRC in March 1986 that
TVA's unlicensed Watts Bar Nuclear Plant near Spring City, Tenn.,
had no major safety problems.
   That was not the case, and the NRC recently concluded that White
lied, although the agency decided against any fine. TVA has said it
still believes White did not mean to mislead the NRC.
   White, insisting he did nothing wrong, contends the charges were
part of an orchestrated effort by TVA opponents to discredit its
nuclear power program.
   The other major figure in TVA's comeback effort has been Runyon,
the former president of Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. USA who was
appointed TVA chairman in January after 44 years in the auto
business.
   He took one look at the utility's rising rates and promptly
launched a huge reorganization designed to keep them steady for at
least three years.
   Included was the much-criticized layoff of 7,400 of TVA's 34,000
employees, but Runyon said the cheaper electricity would ultimately
lure more jobs to the Tennessee Valley.
   ``Our mission is still to improve the quality of life in the
valley,'' said Runyon. ``But to do that today what we have to do is
supply power at a competitive rate.''
   TVA's layers of management, which had ballooned to 12 in some
departments, were slashed to six, creating more streamlined
communication between employees and bosses.
   Runyon also launched a program of bonuses for managers like
White's successor, Oliver D. Kingsley Jr., in an effort to hire and
keep nuclear experts who otherwise might go to better-paying private
utilities.
   Can TVA turn itself around? Observers aren't sure.
   ``Runyon has a very difficult job,'' said Mark Siegel, director
of an often critical watchdog group, the Tennessee Valley Coalition.
``He has done some things that are praiseworthy, in trying to cut
back on duplication and waste.''
   But there's still no clear idea how TVA will pay off its huge
debt, much of it in plant writeoffs that have not yet been passed
along to the rate-payers.
   There are also concerns that Runyon's interest in stable electric
rates may come at the expense of conservation and anti-pollution
efforts, Siegel said.
   White, meanwhile, says TVA should be careful not to repeat the
pinch-penny mistakes that he blames for the nuclear problems.
   ``You can't just talk money and income without talking about
safety and reliability,'' White said.
   Runyon insists the federal agency can adopt efficient operating
methods from private utilities as it seeks to recover its prestige
and financial health.
   ``Business is a good word,'' he said. ``I think too often, well,
(people say) `It's going to run like a business,' and they put that
down like it's not nice. But business is what made the United States
what it is today.''

<HEAD>Discrimination to Produce Integration: The Lesser of Evils</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the Starrett City housing complex in Brooklyn,
skin color determines how long you must wait to move in, and where
you live once you do. If you're white, you wait months; if you're
black, you wait years.
   So why has Jesse Jackson called it the embodiment of ``We Are the
World?'' Why are its policies endorsed by the state NAACP? Why does
Kenneth Clark, whose research helped discredit the doctrine of
``separate but equal,'' say it would be tragic if Starrett City were
forced to change its ways?
   It is because the complex _ one parkway exit from the white
enclave of Howard Beach and a few hundred feet from the black and
Hispanic projects of East New York _ has used racial discrimination
to achieve racial integration.
   It does it with quotas. Starrett City's population is about 55
percent white, a quarter black, 10 percent Hispanic and 5 percent
Asian, a mix that is roughly duplicated on each floor of each
building.
   The result is an urban rarity _ a thoroughly integrated
community, from its two schools and community center down to kids'
Saturday afternoon football games. The bakery even sells wedding
cakes topped with mixed-race bride and groom statuettes.
   But Starrett City's days as a racial paradise appear numbered.
Federal courts have ruled that, whatever their intent, its racial
quotas violate the Fair Housing Act's ban on racial discrimination;
Starrett's appeal is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The case is being watched closely, because the government has
filed similar suits in Chicago and Charlottesville, Va., and is
conducting investigations in other communities.
   Quotas are common in public and private housing complexes around
the nation, according to Robert Rosenberg, Starrett's general
manager and a former city housing official. ``Mostly it's done
surreptitiously. No one talks about it. The only difference is, we
didn't sneak around _ we admitted we were doing it, because we
believe it's not illegal.''
   With 46 apartment towers and more than 20,000 residents, Starrett
City is the largest federally subsidized housing development in
America. But when the middle-income complex was ready for occupancy
12 years ago, black and Hispanic applicants far outnumbered whites.
It was apparent to Rosenberg that he would soon have a segregated
community.
   So Rosenberg, a Jew who was brought up to hate quotas, adopted
them as what he calls ``the lesser of two evils.'' Today, whites
still account for only about 20 percent of Starrett City's
applicants; accordingly, blacks wait several years for an apartment,
whites for a few months.
   If the quotas were replaced by a system of first-come,
first-served, the percentage of white residents would eventually
drop to 20 percent, at the very least. In reality, Rosenberg argues,
virtually all whites would flee around the time they cease to
comprise a majority _ the phenomenon known as ``tipping.''
   To prove its point in court, the complex has presented studies by
Clark, a black sociologist who also was cited by the Supreme Court
in its 1954 school desegregation decision in Brown vs. the Board of
Education.
   ``In a racist society, there is no other way to bring about
stable integration but to recognize that fact of racism and to deal
with it,'' argues Rosenberg.
   But William Bradford Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's
civil rights division, says the end does not justify the means:
``What you're doing is excluding people and including them by reason
of skin color.''
   Reynolds has been accused of using the Starrett case to try to
justify his opposition to affirmative action quotas designed to help
minorities. In a dissent to the order upholding the original federal
court decision, federal appellate Judge Jon Newman wrote that the
suit raises ``substantial questions as to the government's
commitment to integrated housing.''
   Starrett City's residents take a less academic view. They like
what they've got, and they want to keep it.
   ``This is integration, and everyone knows it,'' says Joyce
Peeples, an Hispanic whose husband is black. ``I don't feel like a
minority. I feel like I'm part of this community.''
   ``We don't like to use the word `quota,''' says Rabbi Avner
German. ``But for the next 100 years or whatever, if you're going to
have integration, you have to have quotas.''
   Starrett City's stability makes it particularly attractive in a
city whose recent history has been marked by rapid, sometimes
violent changes in the racial composition of many neighborhoods.
   Jimmy O'Pharrow, who is black, moved to Starrett after the public
housing project where he was living began to deteriorate. It was an
old story: as more blacks moved in, whites began moving out,
followed by more affluent blacks. Services seemed to suffer. He
worries the same could happen again.
   Ruth Horowitz moved to Starrett City from neighboring East New
York, which in the 1960s was the scene of ``block-busting'' by
unscrupulous real estate agents; she recalls receiving dozens of
post cards warning that the neighborhood was changing and urging her
to sell her home while she could.
   Now, she lives on a floor with ``an Israeli family, a black
family, a white couple, a black couple with children, an old Jewish
man, two Italian sisters and a family of immigrants from Eastern
Europe.''
   Although surveys indicate that black residents are about equally
divided on quotas, a black community group opposes the government's
suit, as do many black elected officials.
   Reynolds admits the Starrett issue is ``a tough call,'' but
points out that the quota system creates victims _ minority group
members stuck on a waiting list in a city with a critical housing
shortage.
   Blacks' relegation to the back of the waiting line has evoked
comparisons to their place on the bus years ago.
   Karene Freeman, a housing rights attorney, recalls a black woman
crying in her office because her family was languishing on the
waiting list while whites who had applied after she did got in.
   ``If the only way to achieve integration is to discriminate
against blacks, there's something wrong,'' says Phyllis Spiro of the
Open Housing Center.
   But many Starrett residents claim the very process of admitting
more minority applicants will destroy the community they hope to
join.
   ``If there is tipping, the very people who want to get in
wouldn't want to live here,'' says Ms. Horowitz. ``What we've got is
what we're looking for.''
   Rosenberg says management will try to keep up the complex
regardless of who moves in. But he says without quotas something
will be lost: a model of integrated government-subsidized housing
that disproves the notion, voiced mostly recently in nearby Yonkers,
that ``assisted housing must inevitably become segregated housing.''
   Meanwhile, Starrett residents wait anxiously. The impending
change ``is a topic of conversation,'' says Ms. Horowitz. ``Some of
the older people are frightened.'
   But a Jewish community center is under construction. ``We're
betting on Starrett City remaining integrated,'' says Rabbi German.
   What if Starrett City does become segregated?
   ``We have single-race neighborhoods,'' Reynolds has said.
``Nothing wrong with that so long as it doesn't come about by
discriminatory means. If Puerto Ricans want to live with Puerto
Ricans, that's their right ...''
   Rosenberg is more cynical: ``In three years we'll be segregated,
and then they'll be suing us for that.''

   A drop 0.1 percent drop in the government's chief economic
forecasting gauge indicates continued slow growth in the economy,
but economists say they do not expect a recession anytime soon.
   The Commerce Department's report Tuesday on its Leading Economic
Indicators helped pressure the dollar lower, but seemed to have
little effect on the stock market.
   The dollar weakened Tuesday despite concerted dollar purchases by
the central banks of the United States and Japan, and that helped
push bonds down slightly.
   Stocks were little changed Tuesday. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 2.31 points to 2,150.96, while declining issues
outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In other reports Tuesday, the Commerce Department said
construction spending rose 0.6 percent in September to an annual
rate of $403.4 billion as strength in housing and government
construction offset a decline in office building.
   Construction spending for the first nine months of the year is
0.7 percent higher than a year ago, a sluggish performance that
analysts expect will continue because of widespread overbuilding of
offices and other commercial space.
   The drop in the leading indicators was the third in the past five
months.
   ``There is absolutely no question that the economy is slowing
down,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist of the Wefa Group,
an economic consulting firm. ``The only question is whether this
slowdown will lead into a recession.''
   Chimerine said he believed a recession can be avoided over the
next 12 months to 18 months, although he said this forecast could
prove too optimistic if consumer spending slows more than expected
or if the dollar comes under further pressure from foreigners
worried about the ability of the next administration to deal with
budget and trade deficits.
   The recovery from the 1981-82 recession completes a peacetime
record of six years this month and the Reagan administration is
hoping this performance will persuade voters to keep the White House
in Republican hands.

   Energy futures prices have turned mixed, with
home heating oil rising on seasonal demands and other crude oil
products losing ground.
   The December contract for wholesale heating oil was up 0.42 cent
a gallon to settle at 43.17 cents Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, after falling 0.71 cent on Monday. Other contract months
also rose.
   Among other petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday,
unleaded gasoline, which slipped 1.52 cents on Monday, fell another
0.71 cent to 43.62 cents a gallon.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, settled at $13.44 a barrel, down 14 cents. The contract
was off 27 cents in the previous session.
   John O'Connell, a senior energy analyst for Refco Inc., said
increased seasonal demand and technical factors largely were
responsible for Tuesday's rise in home heating oil prices. But he
said continued worries about overproduction among OPEC members,
particularly giant producer Saudi Arabia, kept other prices down.
   O'Connell said trading was thin as most dealers were reluctant to
take any major positions until the cartel held its scheduled meeting
later this month.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plans to meet
in Vienna on Nov. 17 to discuss tightening production to boost

<HEAD>Savings Bonds to Carry 7.35 Percent Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. savings bonds will earn interest at a rate
of 7.35 percent over the next six months, the highest return since
early 1986, according to the Treasury Department.
   The department said Tuesday that the the new rate, which took
effect immediately, was up from a rate of 6.90 percent earned in the
last six months. It is the highest rate since savings bonds earned
8.36 percent from November 1985 through May 1986.
   Interest on savings bonds is adjusted on May 1 and Nov. 1, to
reflect open market interest rates. The rate is based on 85 percent
of the yield on five-year Treasury securities, which have averaged
8.65 percent over the past six months.
   Since the government switched to market rates for savings bonds
in November 1982, the rate of return has averaged 8.32 percent.
Investors who hold their bonds for at least five years earn the
average of the half-year rates.
   In addition, investors are guaranteed a minimum interest rate,
regardless of what the market rates do. That minimum, guaranteed
rate is currently 6 percent. But for bonds purchased before Nov. 1,
1986, the minimum is 7.5 percent.

   Chinese officials are taking pains to assure
foreign businesses that their contracts will be honored despite
plans to slash domestic spending and shut down hundreds of domestic
companies.
   China's handling of its latest austerity drive, the third since
it opened to foreign trade and investment in 1978, shows a new
awareness of the need to temper the effect of policy swings and
avoid frightening away foreign investors considered key to
development.
   Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, Trade Minister Zheng
Tuobin and the Bank of China all have promised in recent weeks that
China's 9,700 foreign joint ventures will be exempt from austerity
measures intended to stem a 20-percent inflation.
   ``All signed contracts for ordering goods and joint ventures will
be implemented,'' Li told about 200 visiting chief executive
officers of American companies on Oct. 17. He repeated the same
message later in the week to a Japanese banking delegation.
   The Bank of China, the chief Chinese lender to joint ventures,
said it will continue doing so.
   One of China's leading investment and trade companies, the Kang
Hua Development Corp., which has been stripped of trade rights and
ordered to divest many subsidiaries as punishment for illegal
operations, promised it will carry out all contracts already signed
with foreign companies.
   Kang Hua has signed about 4,000 import and export contracts worth
a total of $670 million since being founded 17 months ago.
   The assurances seem to be having their desired effect. Foreign
businessmen and diplomats in Beijing said they expect a drop in
Chinese import orders but not a significant reduction in joint
venture activity. Most seemed confident the impact would be minimal.
   One predicted delays in signing new contracts, however, as the
central government scrutinizes local projects more closely to weed
out any not deemed essential.
   Chinese officials say consumption and industrial growth must be
slowed and Beijing must reassert central control over the economy to
restore order to a market in which excessive demand has generated
inflation, hoarding and black marketeering.
   Foreign companies that sell factory equipment, raw materials and
luxuries to China, from cars to air conditioners, can expect a drop
in orders. Import taxes on a wide range of goods have been increased
and calls have been issued for import substitution where possible.
   However, Premier Li told the chief executive officers that China
remains interested in joint projects in energy, transportation,
communications, raw material production and high-technology.
   Foreign companies that want to manufacture consumer appliances in
China, such as televisions and refrigerators, are welcome only if
their products are for export, Li said.
   The government also has said the construction of hotels,
auditoriums and other public buildings will be sharply curtailed.
Companies found guilty of illegal transactions, such as buying and
selling scarce goods on the black market, will be closed and
companies set up by government offices will be shut down or spun off.
   Specifics, such as which projects will be halted and which
Chinese companies reorganized or closed, have been slow to emerge,
and foreign businessmen said it was too early to predict the
eventual impact. There have been no reports of casualties in the
form of canceled contract talks.
   The government also ordered slowdowns in economic growth in 1980
and 1985 when it ran short of foreign currency reserves needed for
imports. Some joint ventures were halted in midstream or canceled,
as were many import orders.
   ``At that time (the Chinese) had no cash,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``Now it's different, they have the cash. They're trying
to pause and think.''

   A bold effort to start a U.S. company
aimed at denting Japan's manufacturing dominance in computer memory
devices has failed because American chip users would not help
finance the venture, according to the venture capitalist who
originated the idea.
   ``I've given up,'' Pierre Lamond, a general partner at Sequoia
Capital and co-founder of National Semiconductor Corp., said Tuesday.
   ``I've been working on it since May. We gave ourselves a
timetable and a limit, and we could not get any sizable industrial
partner to sign on the dotted line,'' Lamond said..
   ``We had lot of promises, a lot of interest, but it was all talk,
no action.''
   Lamond's plan for a partnership to finance a memory chip
start-up, using $15 million cash from investors and $425 million in
lease guarantees from U.S. chip users, was an attempt to wrest from
Japan some of the $5.7 billion worldwide market for DRAMs _ dynamic
random access memory chips.
   Those chips, in short supply for about a year, are critical
components in desktop computers, printers and dozens of other
electronic goods.
   Some American computer companies have been forced to curtail
production or raise prices because of the DRAM shortage and have
complained that Japanese chip users get preferential treatment from
Japanese chipmakers.
   Most U.S. chipmakers have dropped out of the memory chip
business, largely because Japanese companies in the late 1970s and
early 1980s sold chips at below-market prices to grab market share.
   Only two U.S. companies, Texas Instruments Inc. in Dallas and
Micron Technology Inc. in Boise, Idaho, continue to make and sell
DRAMs in the United States.
   ``Although users of DRAMs complain about the treatment they're
getting from the Japanese, they're not willing to put their money
where their mouth is,'' said Lamond. ``...I guess they're satisfied
with the Japanese as suppliers.''
   Lamond had approached four computer makers affected by the DRAM
shortage: Apple Computer Inc. of Cupertino, Sun Microsystems Inc. of
Mountain View, Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston and Digital
Equipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass.
   ``If I could not convince four major forward-looking companies, I
don't think I could convince other smaller companies,'' Lamond said.
   Apple and Sun spokesmen said they had no immediate comment.
Digital and Compaq were closed late Tuesday when contacted for
comment.
   The worldwide DRAM market is expected to grow from $5.7 billion
this year to $10.5 billion by 1992, according to Dataquest Inc., a
San Jose, Calif., market research firm.
   ``The Japanese have 90 percent of the worldwide market for one
megabit DRAMs,'' Lamond said, referring to the tiny chips that can
hold 1 million bits of information. ``They're now assembling the
next generation, four megabit chips, and are expected to go into
production in 1990, and they'll probably grab 95 percent of that
market.
   ``It's scary to be at the mercy of a single supplier,'' he said.
``They will be able to throttle, help or injure any one of the
users. If they don't like a particular company, they won't ship to
it. Or more likely, they'll say, `If you want DRAMs, you have to buy
everything else from us.'''
   The proposed company, dubbed Megaram by Lamond, would have
employed about 1,000 workers, he said, and attempted to reach $100
million in sales by its third year.
   Lamond sought $15 million in venture capital for Megaram's
initial working capital. He wanted chip users to provide lease
guarantees for $125 million in chipmaking plant and equipment during
Megaram's first phase and $300 million over five years.
   The chip users would have been liable for the leases only if
Megaram defaulted on its payment.
   Lamond said the lease guarantee arrangement was one way to avoid
the high cost of capital, which has been a problem for U.S.
technology companies competing with Japanese firms.
   In return for the lease guarantees, the U.S. companies would have
a ``priority call'' on the memory chips, which would be sold at
market prices.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. is selling its Louisiana Intrastate
Gas Corp. pipeline business, which it purchased three years ago for
more than $500 million.
   Tuesday's announced sale, expected to be completed by next
spring, is part of a restructuring move prompted by last month's
$7.3 billion sale of the company's Tenneco Oil Co. subsidiary.
   Tenneco officials did not disclose the anticipated sale price for
the business.
   LIG, an affiliate of Tenneco Gas Pipeline Group, operates
approximately 1,900 miles of intrastate gas pipelines for deliveries
into Louisiana's industrial heartland.
   The Louisiana affiliate contributed about $10.3 million in
pre-tax revenue to Tenneco in 1987, said spokeswoman Suzanne Thomas.
   James L. Ketelsen, chairman of the board and chief executive
officer, said Tenneco acquired LIG in 1985 primarily to secure
access to makets for gas production from Tenneco Oil.
   ``With the sale of Tenneco Oil Company, ownership of these
properties is no longer strategically important,'' he said.
   LIG has an average daily pipeline flow of 650 million cubic feet
and serves more than 75 customers, including agricultural and
industrial plants, electric utilities, local distribution companies
and paper mills, Ms. Thomas said.
   The sale will not affect Tenneco's other interstate or intrastate
natural gas pipeline businesses, company officials said. The company
operates approximately 20,000 miles of pipeline in a 26-state market
area, Ms. Thomas said.
   The company said it expects to identify a buyer by the end of
1988 and close the deal no later than March 31, 1989.
   Tenneco is a diversified industrial corporation with major
business interests in natural gas pipelines, farm and construction
equipment, automotive parts, shipbuilding, packaging, chemicals and
minerals.

<TEXT>
   Directors of Utah Power & Light Co. and
PacifiCorp have signaled their acceptance of federal conditions
imposed on a proposed $2 billion merger of the utility holding
companies, although they do not necessarily like them, a spokesman
says.
   Directors unanimously reaffirmed their support for a proposed
merger on Tuesday, and extended until Dec. 15 the previous Oct. 31
deadline for either company to terminate the merger if not closed by
the deadline.
   The stock swap merger was approved in August 1987 by both
companies and state regulators in seven states later concurred.
   However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week gave
its approval on condition that the merged company's transmission
lines were opened to competing utilities to ensure the merger would
not be anticompetitive.
   ``From this you can infer that the companies will accept the
conditions the FERC said it will impose, although we think that some
of the conditions are unnecessary and harsh...specifically,
transmission access,'' Utah Power spokesman Dave Mead said.
   Officials of Portland-based PacifiCorp said that while not all
the FERC conditions were believed to be justified, they will not
have a significant effect on the vast majority of merger benefits.
Those include savings from administrative combinations, work force
reductions and meeting peak demand requirements more efficiently.
   Power supply benefits relating to more efficient use of
generating resources between the two companies also remain intact
under the conditions.
   Mead said the merger still was expected to gain Utah customers a
5 percent to 10 percent rate reduction over a four-year period.
   ``Our best estimate is that the FERC transmission conditions will
reduce wholesale power benefits by approximately $1 million annually
for the first five years following the merger,'' said Dave Bolender,
president of PacifiCorp's Pacific Power & Light division.
   ``The primary purpose of the merger is to strengthen our ability
to offer an attractive, competitively priced array of energy
services to our retail customers in an increasingly competitive
marketplace,'' he said. ``The FERC order will not detract from our
ability to compete in that changed marketplace.''
   Utah's Public Service Commission issued an order suspending its
approval of the merger and scheduled a Nov. 8 hearing on the effect
of the FERC's order. Mead said UP&L would present its analysis of
the conditions affecting the merger at that time and were optimistic
about regaining the PSC's approval.
   The merged utility would become one of the largest utilities in
the West, serving more than 1 million customers in a seven-state
service area that also includes Oregon, California, Washington,
Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
   The FERC expressed concern the merger would stifle competition in
the Western states wholesale power market with a single utility
owning strategic transmission stretching from the Northwest to the
Southwest.
   From the onset, both utilities said that integrating their
transmission systems would provide huge benefits and profits as they
used the merged system to sell excess capacity to lucrative markets
in the Southwest and ``wheel'' power between divisions to stabilize
seasonal periods of low and high demand.
   But FERC's approval requires the merged company to open its
transmission to competing utilities and meet ``all bona fide
requests for service either by using its existing capacity or by
building new facilities.''

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade with soybeans taking the lead
amid indications the Soviet Union was negotiating new purchases of
South American soybean meal.
   Analysts say any indication of new grain or soybean purchases by
the Soviets is generally regarded as bullish for the U.S. markets.
   Analysts said soybean meal values on overseas cash markets were
slightly higher this morning, which added to the stronger tone in
Chicago.
   Soybean oil futures also opened higher but Dale Gustafson, grain
market analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago, said,
``I think it's the interest in the meal providing the underlying
strength for beans.''
   Wheat futures opened mixed and corn was marginally higher. Both
of those markets were awaiting confirmation of rumored new export
business, Gustafson said.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.18 a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1 cent higher with December at $2.85{ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.32{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 7} cents higher with November at $7.84{ a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .07 cent higher with December
at 73.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .25 cent
higher with November at 81.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent
lower to .38 cent higher with December at 41.80 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .25 cent to .53 cent higher with February
at 47.10 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Tuesday while pork futures were
mostly higher.

<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only one utility defendant remains in the
securities fraud trial stemming from the Washington Public Power
Supply System's record $2.25 billion municipal bond default.
   District Judge William Browning signed an order Tuesday dropping
14 Washington state utilities from the trial.
   As the trial reconvened today, Browning told the jurors that 14
utilities had settled but instructed them not to infer anything from
the settlement.
   ``You should not consider it,'' the judge instructed. ``You
should not draw any inference of any party.''
   Browning's order came hours after the U.S. Department of Justice
in Washington, D.C., approved the federal government's share of a
$226 million settlement between the utilities and purchasers of
municipal bonds used to build two WPPSS nuclear power plants that
were abandoned before completion.
   Browning still must approve the settlement. A hearing on that
matter is to be scheduled.
   The settlement leaves Snohomish County Public Utility District as
the sole utility defendant in the trial.
   Snohomish has until Nov. 10 to join in the settlement by
approving a $48.6 million offer, said Mel Weiss, an attorney for the
plaintiff bond purchasers.
   The trial will now take on a new complexion with the other
utilities gone, he said.
   The plaintiffs will have to focus on the three other remaining
defendants: Ebasco Services Inc. and United Engineers & Contractors
Inc., two engineering companies that built the unfinished plants,
and Blyth Eastman Paine Webber Inc., a WPPSS financial adviser.
   ``The professional parties haven't been our main focus up to
now,'' Weiss said. ``There will be a greater concentration of effort
to pinpoint the professionals' involvement.''
   Harlan ``Hank'' Kosmata, a WPPSS liaison with the 88 utilities
that contracted with WPPSS to build the plants, has spent 15 days
testifying about events that led to the default. He was to continue
his testimony today.
   The 17-member jury has heard hours of taped meetings of utility
representatives discussing the plants' funding and construction
problems.
   The three professional defendants are being sued by a class of
more than 24,000 past and present bondholders.
   Chemical Bank of New York, a trustee for bondholders, sued only
the utilities. It will remain in the case as long as Snohomish
remains a defendant.
   The plaintiffs claim that the defendants lied and hid information
that might have discouraged potential investors in the WPPSS
municipal bonds. The defendants deny the charges.
   WPPSS defaulted on the bonds in 1983 after scrapping the plants a
year earlier.
   On Tuesday, the Justice Department approved a $35 million
settlement contribution by Bonneville Power Administration, the
power broker in the Pacific Northwest.
   Boards and commissions for the 14 utilities approved settlement
proposals Monday, bringing their share to $181 million.
   Washington state will add $10 million to the settlement package,
contingent on legislative approval.
   There were more than 100 defendants in the fraud suit, but
settlements left only 18 when the trial began Sept. 7. The trial,
moved to Arizona because of pretrial publicity, was expected to last
up to a year.
   A total of $591 million in settlements plus $96 million in
disputed insurance have been reached.

<TEXT>
   When a wave of hot-stock thinking overruns the
stock market, as it does from time to time and is doing now, it is
easy to forget what sensible investing is all about.
   The truth of the observation was illustrated recently when an
investment guru grew enthusiastic about a ``contrarian'' mutual
fund, basing his support for it on the belief you should do the
opposite of what the crowd is doing.
   Contrarian thinking has many supporters, but it is only in
hot-stock times like these that the fund mentioned could be
considered contrarian.
   The fund's recipe for winning includes:
   1. Finding companies offering products or services that people
want.
   2. Determining if better management of a company could turn it
around.
   3. Finding companies with undervalued assets that might be sold
to pay down debt and enable the company to focus on profitable areas.
   4. Determining a company's earnings potential and time needed to
realize that potential.
   Contrarian? All four would be criteria on any basic investor's
list. That is, at times other than now, when investment analysts
have forsaken many of the fundamentals while searching for the next
takeover candidate.
   Signs of the times can always be found in hot investment markets,
since it is here that people's frustrations, dreams, ambitions,
greed and follies become focused. Add fear to that list; it's been
there since the market crash.
   Reflecting the insecurity of today's investment markets,
newsletter writers are promoting almost any conceivable scenario.
Millions of people can attest to it, since they are recipients of
the promotional literature.
   Here's one with a message so urgent it begins on the outside of
the envelope:
   ``Imagine: The prime rate will reach 35 percent. Gold will
surpass $1,800 an ounce. Real estate will fall to 1 cent on the
dollar. Oil at 25 cents a barrel.''
   The message continues inside. An overnight real estate crash, it
states, might make your $175,000 home worth just $1,750. In one day!
``Don't scoff,'' says the writer, ``it's happened before and will
happen again.''
   You'd better hurry if you want to get this inside information.
Sign up now and pay only $39 a year, ``a saving of $110.''
   What, you say, no way! Well, perhaps you'll reconsider when you
find that this same seer foresees a Dow Jones industrial average,
now more than 2,000 points, falling to 41 (forty-one).
   Wherever money is being saved, spent or invested you can find the
signs and portents. Did you know that there is a direct correlation
between new-home lot sizes and interest rates? It's being touted as
almost infallible.
   U.S. Housing Markets, a publication of Lomas Mortgage USA, traced
the relationship for the past 11 calendar years and found it happens
every time: When interest rates fall, lot sizes go up. When they
rise, lot sizes fall.
   In 1982, for example, conventional mortgages averaged 15.14
percent, and lot size was only 8,265 square feet, the lowest between
1977 and 1987. Last year, the mortgage rate fell to 9.31 percent,
and lot size rose to 9,295 feet.
   Taxes, of course, emit signs of the times, and right now the
signs seem to be pointing to confusion. There is good reason for
this, since in 1986 there was enacted a tax simplification act that,
of all things, complicated matters.
   Following the Tax Reform Act of 1986 there came the Revenue Act
of 1987 and the Technical Corrections Bill, now before Congress. The
result, according to the ``Arthur Andersen Tax Guide and Planner''
for 1989 is that ``some taxpayers seem to be giving up hope of ever
developing effective tax strategies.''
   Tax reform was supposed to free people from the quirks of
lawmakers and the Internal Revenue Service. Instead, say the
Andersen folks, people ``feel they are at the mercy of the lawmakers
and the IRS.''
   They are confused, and confusion is perhaps the most significant
sign of the times.

<HEAD>Buyer May Sell Retail, Credit Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prospective buyers of Wickes Cos. say they
are considering breaking up the company and selling retail and
credit operations, including Wickes Furniture and Builders Emporium,
if their bid succeeds.
   The Blackstone Group and Wasserstein, Perella & Co., New York
investor groups which launched a $538.9 million buyout Tuesday,
disclosed their intent to sell parts of the company in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The takeover, negotiated with management, will be accomplished
through an $11.25 per share tender offer to stockholders.
   ``The purchaser expects to sell a significant amount of the
company's assets,'' according to a registration statement for the
tender offer. ``Based on information currently available to it, the
purchaser expects to sell most or all of the company's retail and
credit operations.''
   The statement says the tentative decision to sell various
operations may be reversed or altered.
   The retailers, Wickes Furniture, Builders Emporium home
improvement stores, and Orchard Supply Hardware stores, accounted
for about 31 percent of the company's sales last year. The credit
operations offer financing for the retail stores.
   Wickes other operations include automotive products, wallpaper,
fabrics and the Kayser-Roth hosiery and apparel units.
   Blackstone and Wasserstein, Perella executives will replace
Sanford Sigoloff, the Wickes chairman who saved the company from
bankruptcy and sought to take it private in a leveraged buyout that
led to the investor groups' successful takeover bid.

   National Convenience Stores Inc. said Wednesday it
has agreed to buy at least 79 San Antonio-area Southland Corp.
stores for an undisclosed amount of cash.
   The sale, which is still subject to a definitive agreement, is
expected to close in January 1989, officials said.
   ``While our stores in San Antonio are good stores in a good
market, we made this decision after long and careful consideration
of what will help us best achieve our longterm strategic
objectives,'' said Jere W. Thompson, president and chief executive
officer of Dallas-based Southland.
   ``Along these lines, we are pleased that our stores are being
purchased as an ongoing business, which is very important to us for
the future of our employees,'' Thompson said.
   Houston-based NCS, which operates Stop N Go stores, operates
approximately 1,080 specialty retail stores in five Sunbelt states.
   Southland is the world's largest convenience retailer, with more
than 7,000 7-Eleven and other convenience stores that are supported
by Southland's distribution and food centers.

   A quick glance at the Range Rover might not excite you.
   But open the door and let the smell of leather waft your way.
Climb up and lounge inside the roomy interior.
   Take the Range Rover out on a tortuous dirt road and revel in the
oh-so-smooth ride. Head out for the paved highway and marvel at the
lack of road noise.
   This is what a luxury, four-wheel-drive, sport utility vehicle is
all about. The British have known this since 1970, when the Range
Rover _ a descendant of the hearty Land Rover _ was introduced.
   Since the Range Rover's U.S. debut in March 1987, it has been
winning hearts here, too. Range Rover passed its own target of 3,000
sales in its first 12 months in this country, posting sales of 3,350
by March 1988.
   A recent survey of Range Rover buyers showed a startling 95
percent would buy the vehicle again and 98 percent would recommend
one to a friend. Don't think Range Rover buyers aren't selective.
   We're talking actors Tom Cruise and Don Johnson, comedian Tracey
Ullman and band leader Doc Severinsen among the thousands of buyers.
British royalty also are Range Rover fans.
   Average household income of buyers is $200,000-plus and average
age is 43.5 years. Range Rover says a majority pay cash for the
vehicle, which starts at approximately $35,000.
   The company says purchasers also have active lifestyles, meaning
trips to beach houses, fishing, hunting, skiing excursions, etc.
   Twenty-five percent of the primary drivers are female. Nearly
everything you'd expect in a luxury sedan is standard on the Range
Rover: air conditioning, premium AM-FM radio with cassette player
and anti-theft device, cruise control and power seats and windows,
for example.
   The only options are leather upholstery ($1,125), sunroof
($1,375) and Beluga black exterior with burled walnut interior trim
($1,500). Yet the vehicle has all the necessities of a sport utility
vehicle _ and more.
   Besides the always-engaged four-wheel-drive, there are
long-travel coil springs at each of the four wheels to give that
smooth ride, even on bumpy dirt roads.
   Besides the high riding perch and high center of gravity, there
are four Michelin tires that were specially designed to bite into
tough terrain and alternatively travel pavement without the whirring
sound often heard in sport utilities.
   Besides a big, aluminum block, General Motors Corp.-designed V-8,
there are four-wheel disc brakes. There's also a toll-free telephone
number to call for help, even if you run out of gas.
   And Range Rover says the three-year, 36,000-mile warranty, which
covers the complete vehicle except tires, is the best in the
industry for a vehicle of this type.
   The test vehicle, a Range Rover in Beluga black with burled
walnut trim on the doors, was one of only 150 limited editions. At
first glance, it looked utilitarian outside, boxy and rather
un-modern.
   Climbing aboard _ you really have to swing up _ it almost felt
like a tank, with a thick steering wheel and the engine rumbling
under the hood. But the image changed once the Range Rover got
moving.
   It was fairly easy to maneuver, didn't seem to need a real wide
turning arc and was capable of taking on almost anything in its path.
   It went up a steep hill of gravel, and down the same hill, with
less effort and stress than I did at the wheel. It went through sand
nearly effortlessly. It traversed gulches with ease.
   It made a believer out of me. On highways and neighborhood
streets, the Range Rover offered a good view in all directions
because of the high riding position.
   Braking was superb for a vehicle of this type. The suspension
offered decent handling, even considering the high center of gravity
which tends to make all sport utility vehicles less stable than
autos.
   The Range Rover has aluminum body panels welded to a steel frame,
so rust problems are kept to a minimum.
   The vehicle can tow up to 7,700 pounds, though 5,000 pounds is
the optimum.
   But even the Range Rover isn't perfect. The driver side doorway
has no handle at the ceiling or window pillar to help the driver
climb aboard. It would have helped, especially on the days I wore a
skirt.
   The engine, while a mighty V-8 that does admirably off-road,
didn't have much pickup. The vehicle kind of lumbered into traffic.
It also slurped fuel. The government rating is 14 miles per gallon,
combined city and highway driving.
   Consumer Reports does not list the Range Rover in its survey of
owner problems.
   Range Rover says it is the first in this ultra-luxury sport
utility market in the United States. About the closest competitors
are a leather-appointed Jeep Cherokee Limited for about $25,000 and
the Jeep Grand Wagoneer for more than $25,000. But that's destined
to change when a $38,850 Laforza sport utility vehicle goes on sale
in the United States.
   It has a body and interior by Italian coachmaker Pininfarin and a
Ford V-8 engine.
   Range Rover, which is not expected to change substantially its
vehicle for the 1989 model year beginning this month, is not
worried. As spokesman Bill Baker said: ``We have an 18-year heritage
of proven performance.''

   Share prices finished lower Wednesday on
profit-taking on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished the
day off 14.6 points, or 0.8 percent, at 1,843.2.
   A relatively light 427.9 million shares were traded, compared
with the 473.6 million shares Tuesday.
   ``There's a sense of frustration around,'' said a market maker
for a large brokerage firm, saying that players were disappointed
with the absence of any new trading impetus.
   In addition, the execution of two large computer-generated sell
programs also cast a negative pall over the market, some market
watchers said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 12.1 points to 1,495.6.
The Financial Times 500-share index fell 7.44 points to 1,050.69 at

   The stock market was mixed in uneventful trading
this afternoon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.07 points at
2,152.03 at 2 p.m. EST.
   The broader market was lower, however. Declining issues outpaced
advancing ones by around 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with
764 issues down, 617 up and 540 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 112.24 million shares.
   Activity continues to be dampened by the market's anticipation of
upcoming events: notably Friday's release of U.S. unemployment data
for October and the presidential election next Tuesday.

   The U.S. dollar fell Wednesday against nearly all
major currencies in choppy European trading despite reported efforts
by the U.S. and Japanese central banks to support the currency. Gold
bullion prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said bearish sentiment on the dollar
remained strong despite repeated intervention in the market by the
U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. They said the pressure
by the central bank's dollar-buying kept the dollar's slide in
check, however.
   The Bank of Japan has intervened in support of the dollar for
three consecutive days, the dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.62 Japanese yen to a closing 124.68
yen. Later in London, the dollar edged back up to 124.82 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7740 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7668 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with Tuesday's late rates,
included: 1.7840 West German marks, down from 1.7865; 1.4975 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5025; 6.0885 French francs, down from 6.0965;
2.0193 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0155; 1,322.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,331.50; and 1.2275 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2278.
   Gold prices surged amid buying interest from the Middle East and
a sharp rise in platinum prices, dealers said.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $417.20 a troy ounce from
$411.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $417 an ounce from
$411 late Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $413.90 an ounce, up from
$413.89 at Tuesday's close.
   Silver bullion jumped in London to a late bid of $6.45 a troy
ounce, up from $6.28 late Tuesday.

   Travelers Corp. on Wednesday reported its
third-quarter earnings rose 8 percent as the insurance company's
revenue increased 2 percent.
   Travelers said it earned $91 million, or 89 cents per share, in
the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $84 million, or 79 cents per
share, in the same period a year ago.
   Total third-quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, compared to $4.3
billion in the same period of 1987.
   ``Third-quarter results benefitted from continued strong earnings
from our property-casualty commercial line operations,'' Edward H.
Budd, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
   ``While health-insurance claim costs continue to increase
rapidly, substantial price increases are taking effect and results
improved for the quarter,'' Budd said. ``The company is continuing
to implement major cost-saving programs across all operations.''
   For the first nine months of the year, the company reported a
loss of $175 million, compared to net income of $332 million, or
$3.19 per share, for the first nine months of 1987.
   The loss reflected the impact of the $415 million addition to
reserves for real estate operations in the second quarter.
   For the first nine months, total revenue was $14.9 billion,
compared to $13.9 billion for the first nine months of 1987.

<HEAD>Soybeans Close Up Sharply On Soviet-Buying Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in response to rumors that
the Soviet Union had made a large purchase of U.S. soybeans or
soybean meal and was planning to buy more.
   Rumors about Soviet buying also fueled moderate gains in the corn
market, analysts said. Wheat closed mostly higher in quiet trading.
   Analysts said there were indications the Soviets also may have
purchased soybeans from Brazil or Argentina.
   The rumors did not indicate how the Soviet purchases broke down
by country of origin. But of the overall amount, ``the talk is about
500,000 (metric) tons with more bids being put out overnight,'' said
Mario Balletto, soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc. in New York.
   Soybeans for delivery in November traded during the session to $8
a bushel for the first time since Oct. 20 but ended slightly below
that level.
   The Soviets also were said to have purchased 1.5 million to 2
million metric tons of U.S. corn, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 2\ cents higher with December

<HEAD>Auctioneer Proposes Public Auction for Sears Tower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Who wants to buy the Sears Tower?
   Not me, says Donald Trump.
   Not us, say the Japanese.
   But local real-estate auctioneer Joel Zegart believes these big
spenders will be among the bidders if Sears, Roebuck and Co. buys
his proposal to hold a public auction for the world's tallest
building.
   ``I think it's a smokescreen,'' Zegart, president of JBS &
Associates Inc., said Wednesday of the many denials among those seen
as the most likely bidders for the 110-story headquarters of the
nation's largest retailer.
   ``I think a lot of people are interested and they just aren't
showing their cards yet,'' he said.
   Sears announced Monday it would sell its famed skyscraper as part
of a corporate restructuring designed to boost profits.
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather said the company received a
number of inquiries following its announcement, but he would not
reveal the identities of the interested parties.
   Fairweather also would not comment on the idea of a public
auction.
   He said the sale, which is being handled by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
in conjunction with Sears' own Coldwell Banker real-estate and Dean
Witter Reynolds financial units, would be negotiated privately with
selected prospective buyers who would be invited to submit bids.
   But Zegart, whose firm specializes in auctions of large
investment properties, said a public auction open to all would
generate tremendous interest and result in a sale at the highest
price Sears could hope to receive.
   He said he would start the bidding at $800 million. Analysts say
the building could fetch as much as $1.8 billion.
   Zegart, comparing the one-of-a-kind Sears Tower to a work of art,
said an auction of the building could be as lucrative as the 1987
auction of Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was to the seller in that case.
   Japan's Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. paid $40 million for
the painting by the Dutch Impressionist.
   ``The Sears Tower is a building that you'll never see reproduced
again,'' Zegart said.
   ``You're buying a piece of Chicago when you buy the Sears Tower.
It's the gem of the downtown. It's history, it's a landmark, it's
known around the world.''
   Several Japanese firms say those are precisely the qualities that
make them wary.
   ``This is like buying a piece of America's heart,'' Tokyo-based
investment analyst Masahiko Muranaka told the Chicago Tribune.
   ``That building is a symbol of America and no Japanese company
would be courageous enough to try and buy it,'' Naoya Nishimura,
manager of overseas real estate for Mitsubishi Trust & Banking Co.,
told the Tribune. ``It would be like trying to buy the Empire State
Building.''
   The Trump Organization, which was also seen as a likely bidder
for the tower, is not interested in the Sears building, spokeswoman
Norma Foerderer said.
   Donald Trump, who made his name and fortune in New York real
estate, owns Manhattan's Plaza Hotel and Trump Tower, as well as
other properties there and in Atlantic City, N.J. He recently agreed
to buy Eastern Airlines' northeastern shuttle service.
   Sears, struggling to improve its earnings after three consecutive
quarters of declining profits, announced the planned sale of the
tower as part of a restructuring that also included the proposed
sale of its Coldwell Bankers commercial real estate subsidiary.
Sears also said it would buy back 10 percent of its 380 million
outstanding shares and take $425 million in fourth-quarter charges.
   The company said it would concentrate on consumer-oriented
businesses _ retailing, insurance, residential real estate and
financial services. It announced a revamping of its retailing
strategy, saying it would adopt the everyday low pricing policy that
has worked for its discount store competitors.

   The market took a sudden downturn in the early afternoon, which
analysts attributed to the dollar's persistent decline against major
currencies and a spike in prices of gold and other key commodities.
The commodity price rise rekindled anxiety about inflationary
pressures, analysts said.
   ``All of a sudden, the long-dormant terror about inflation (was)

<HEAD>German Firm Says U.S.-Based ICN Company Targeting Its Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schering AG has been informed that
U.S.-based ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. intends to amass up to 25
percent of the West German company, a Schering spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The spokesman said ICN has told Schering it intends to acquire
and hold $15 million worth of the common stock in the
pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, which would amount to about 1
percent of its outstanding shares, and may later increase the
holding up to 25 percent.
   Ralph Harenberg, Schering's spokesman, said the company considers
ICN's bid for its shares as a hostile offer.
   ``Schering AG has notified ICN Pharmaceuticals that Schering
regards any sizable purchase of its stock as unwelcome,'' the German
company said in a statement.
   There was no answer at the Costa Mesa, Calif. office of an ICN
spokesman when a reporter called for comment.
   Harenberg said Schering's largest shareholder, the insurance
giant Allianz AG, holds 6 percent of its shares. The rest of the
shares are held by about 42,000 individual investors.
   He said ICN's bid will be blocked by his company's voting rights
limitation that restricts the execution of voting rights to a 4.2
percent stake.
   ``We don't believe a takeover is possible,'' Harenberg said.
   The voting rights limitation ``clearly demonstrates the desire of
Schering's stockholders to assure a wide distribution of Schering's
stock,'' the company statement said.
   ICN, which had $121 million in sales last year, approached
Schering in late September with an offer to purchase an unspecified
stake in the German company, but the offer was rejected, Harenberg
said.
   He said the company initially learned of ICN's actions from a
request by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which asked Schering
for the stock data after ICN had registered with the FTC its intent
to seek a stake in the German company valued at 15 million dollars.

   A battle over America's industrial future
is being fought in this Chicago suburb, where the nation's last
major manufacturer of televisions is under siege from Wall Street.
   The struggle for Zenith Electronics Corp. is being watched
closely by Washington, Silicon Valley and foreign capitals because
of what it could mean for the future of the United States in high
technology.
   Two New Yorkers who ordinarily specialize in stock market
speculation are asking Zenith shareholders to decide by Dec. 4
whether to dump the company's chief executive from the board of
directors and install them.
   The Wall Street arbitragers say they want to get rid of Zenith's
money-losing television business. If they win, they will seek a
buyer for the TV business or if necessary sell the whole company,
which includes a successful personal computer division.
   The challenge by Brookhurst Partners comes, ironically, at the
very time many experts are saying the United States needs to have a
home-based TV manufacturing industry as a matter of national
competitiveness _ if not national pride.
   An emerging theory says the sharp, bright televisions of the
1990s will be so crammed with advanced electronics that the United
States must keep its hand in the business or fall to second-rate
status in entire fields of electronics.
   High-definition television, so called for the striking clarity of
its picture, will have 1,000 to 1,250 horizontal lines on a screen,
twice the current number, permitting vivid color and sharp detail.
Worldwide sales could hit $40 billion a year in the coming decade.
   Right now, Japan is far ahead.
   ``High-definition TV has become a symbol of a much larger issue,
which is whether the U.S. is going to lose control of the driving
forces of economic growth for the first time since Henry Ford
invented the modern assembly line,'' argues Fred Branfman, director
of Rebuild America, a group that favors government-industry
partnerships.
   It is hard at first to swallow the argument that televisions _
the boxes that bring us ``Wheel of Fortune'' _ are vital to national
security. But Americans have begun to learn what the Japanese always
knew, that success in exotic technology depends on having a solid
base in household items.
   Consumer electronics give Japanese companies invaluable
experience in making things small, reliable, easy to use and
inexpensive, lessons they apply to invading such American
strongholds as mainframe computers.
   Although consumer electronics is not a high-profit business, it
is so large that Japan, with half the U.S. population, has surpassed
the United States in consumption of computer chips.
   In the electronics business, size is strength. The South Koreans
and Taiwanese, among others, are following Japan's bigger-is-better
strategy as they pile up trade surpluses with the United States.
   Zenith by itself is not all that important. In spite of its
illustrious history, it is only the world's 13th largest color TV
maker, tied with a Finnish company called Nokia Corp.
   But if Zenith cannot make it in televisions, it is not clear what
American company can. Zenith, after all, has a famous brand name,
strong relations with retailers, and the advantage of already being
in the business.
   For an outsider, jumping into the TV business would be like
trying to hop onto a speeding train. That explains why giants such
as International Business Machines Corp. have not started making TVs
in spite of their public statements about the importance of a U.S.
presence in the industry.
   Should a big U.S. company other than Zenith gear up a factory to
make the next generation of televisions?
   ``For the good of the country, yes. For the good of their
shareholders, no. The stock would go straight down,'' said Stephen
Balog, an electronics analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Standing up for Zenith is Jerry K. Pearlman, 49, the chairman,
president and chief executive, a 17-year veteran of the 70-year-old
company who is looking for ways to return its TV business to
profitability in spite of cutthroat foreign competition.
   With deliberate vagueness, Pearlman says possibilities under
discussion include types of cooperation such as sharing factory
space with other companies, selling other companies' products under
Zenith labels, and selling Zenith products under other labels.
   Opposing Pearlman are the partners of Brookhurst, Herbert B.
Abelow, 54, and Nicholas L. Ihasz, 44, who fled Hungary with his
family after Soviet troops quashed an uprising in 1956.
   Abelow and Ihasz are being cast as villains by the Zenith forces,
but they say they are simply asking the shareholders _ the company's
true owners _ what they think should be done with the company.
   ``I come from a communist country. I think owning shares is like
having the right to vote,'' Ihasz said. ``This is the most
democratic process I can think of.''
   Life was simpler in 1918, when two wireless radio enthusiasts
named R.H.G. Mathews and Karl Hassel began making sets on a kitchen
table in Chicago for what would become Zenith.
   Among those who used Zenith's early radios were King Alexander I
of Yugoslavia and Donald B. MacMillan, the Arctic explorer. Zenith
began making televisions in 1948 and became famous for its slogan:
``The quality goes in before the name goes on.''
   By the early '60s the Asian invasion of consumer electronics was
well under way. There were 27 U.S.-based TV makers in 1960, 18 in
1968, nine in 1974, five in 1984 and two in 1987, according to a
countdown by IEEE Spectrum, a magazine for electrical engineers.

   The latest U.S. company to drop out was mighty General Electric
Co., which decided in 1987 that the GE and RCA television lines were
not ``core'' businesses and sold them to France's Thomson SA.
   It was widely assumed that if GE got out of televisions, Zenith,
at a tenth the size, could not be far behind. Some Wall Street
analysts became exasperated when Pearlman hung onto the money-losing
business after all.
   Zenith gets half its more than $2 billion in annual sales from
personal computers and related equipment. Surprisingly, it sold more
AT-compatible personal computers last year than anyone, including
IBM.
   Thanks to computers, Zenith expects to make a small pre-tax
profit this year for the first time since 1984. But its consumer
electronics business, mainly TVs, has been running in the red.
   Zenith says foreign companies are dumping TVs here at illegally
low prices and accuses the Commerce Department of failing to enforce
penalties against the alleged dumpers.
   Whatever the reason, Zenith is short on money for investment and
most likely will never manufacture complete high-definition
televisions. Its more modest goal is to get its proposed HDTV
transmission system established as a U.S. standard, which could win
it big royalties from the companies that actually make the TVs.
   Zenith also has a highly praised and patented technology for
sharp, bright computer screens, which it hopes to supply to HDTV
makers. Zenith is asking the federal government for $60 million so
it can make the screens big enough to be used in the new televisions
as well as in military equipment and air traffic control towers.
   Unfortunately for Zenith and other U.S. companies, the Japanese
have built up a nearly insurmountable lead in many aspects of the
technology.
   ``HDTV is not just one technology. It's thousands of
technologies. And the Japanese have ended up by dominating every
single one of those markets,'' said Richard J. Elkus Jr., chairman
and chief executive of Prometrix Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif., and
co-chairman of an American Electronics Association task force on
HDTV.
   Some analysts are skeptical of groups such as Rebuild America
that urge U.S. companies to take the plunge into HDTV on patriotic
grounds. Even if an American company did get into the business, it
would probably have to buy many or most of the components from the
Japanese, they say.
   ``Open up your typical PC from IBM. Do you see products that are
made in Japan? You bet,'' said Balog, the Shearson analyst.
   As for Zenith, although it says its television business is not up
for sale, it negotiated earlier this year with potential European
and Asian buyers.
   The talks reportedly broke down mainly because the governments of
the foreign parties ruled out a purchase, fearing it would stir up
anger among American voters and hurt trade relations.
   Zenith's appeal as the last U.S.-based company in the TV business
is itself rather fuzzy. Most companies in the TV business today are
transnational. Zenith has major operations in Taiwan and Mexico,
while Sony Corp. and others have thousands of U.S. workers.
   Although it is Dutch, for example, NV Philips says it has more
than 12,000 U.S. employees in television-related businesses,
including 350 doing research and development.
   Citing the threat to the U.S. electronics industry, Rebuild
America says the federal government should support a U.S.-based
company or companies in manufacturing high-definition televisions.
   The support could take the form of loans, shared research,
guaranteed purchases or some combination of those, Rebuild's
Branfman said.
   The threat to U.S. electronics is unquestionable. Some of it,
however, stems from such fundamental problems as the inadequate U.S.
educational system, the short-term perspective of investors and
managers and the high cost of money, none of which is addressed by
government support.
   ``Where American companies have been successful, they've had
great technology and great marketing. We shouldn't use trade
barriers or subsidies as a substitute for those,'' said Doug van
Dorsten, a Shearson analyst in San Francisco.
   Elkus, who helped invent the videocassette recorder while at
Ampax Corp., concedes the difficulties but says a U.S.-based
consumer electronics industry is indispensable.
   In this scenario, Zenith is an indicator of which way things are
headed, more so than a major force in its own right.
   ``To really get our feet back in this (HDTV) market we're going
to be talking about something well in excess of a billion dollars,
well in excess,'' he said.
   ``Zenith will not save the world. This is a problem that's so
much bigger than Pearlman and Zenith that you can't imagine.''

   The New Yorkers who are out to sell Zenith
Electronics Corp.'s television-making business admit their public
image leaves much to be desired.
   In Glenview, Ill., Herbert B. Abelow and Nicholas L. Ihasz are
seen as get-rich-quick artists. In New York, where getting rich
quickly is an honorable pursuit, they are seen as inexperienced.
   In a recent interview in their 41st-floor offices near the New
York Stock Exchange, the men said they are simply exercising their
rights as part-owners of the company.
   ``In the late 1800s, management worked for shareholders. But
management just started to think of the companies as their own
places,'' Abelow said.
   In billion-dollar companies such as Zenith, Abelow said,
ownership is spread so thin that individual shareholders feel they
have no power.
   Meanwhile, he said, directors and managers don't care about
shareholders because they themselves have only tiny stakes in the
company.
   Driving the point home, Brookhurst Partners says its 6.1 percent
stake in Zenith is bigger than the stake of all 27 Zenith directors
and officers combined.
   ``The bottom line is we're investors and shareholders like any
other shareholders,'' Abelow said. ``We're not trying to scrub this
company or junk it or give it away to a foreigner.''
   ``All we're really trying to do is ask the shareholders what
their preferences are,'' Ihasz agreed.
   Abelow and Ihasz say Zenith management has shown no ability or
even serious commitment to make its television business profitable.
   Their goal is to boost the price of Zenith's stock by finding a
buyer for the consumer electronics business or, if no one wants just
that part, to find someone who will buy the whole company.
   That, naturally, is not the way Zenith sees it.
   ``What we have here in part are a couple of guys who say this
appears to be easy,'' said Jerry K. Pearlman, Zenith's chairman and
chief executive. ``Somebody comes along and bails you out and you
have a quick, bing-bing turnover and you've made your reputation.''
   Wall Street analysts would be happy to see someone come along and
boost the value of Zenith's stock. But some say Abelow and Ihasz may
not be the right men for such a job because all their experience
lies in the unrelated field of risk arbitrage _ picking stocks of
potential takeover targets.
   ``There's nothing in the Brookhurst reports which indicates they
understand the details of the business,'' said James Magid, a senior
adviser at Needham & Co. ``That's not who I would hire for the job.
That's a blank check.''
   ``I think that people are now coming to the conclusion that these
people are not the right ones to do it,'' said Robert Johnson, an
analyst for Rotan-Mosle Inc. in Houston.
   Ihasz worked from 1976 to 1980 for Ivan Boesky, the speculator
who is now serving three years in prison, a point that Zenith
delights in pointing out to shareholders.
   Ihasz, prepared for questions about the black spot on his resume,
says he was simply a functionary who had nothing to do with Boesky's
illegal trades.
   ``I was physically distanced from him at all times. ... I left in
1980. I've talked to him maybe twice in the last eight years.''
   Pearlman says he needs more time to carry out his plan for
improving Zenith's profitability, accusing Brookhurst of having its
eye only on short-term profits. That does not sit well with
Brookhurst.
   ``In one of the greatest economic expansions in history, how can
you not be profitable for almost four years?'' Ihasz responded.
``What is long-term? How long do you need?''
   ``We believe in capital formation, all the good things. We're not
against motherhood,'' Abelow said.
   ``I think it would be good probably to have an American producer
(of televisions) ... but I don't consider televisions to be
necessarily a national security item,'' Abelow said.
   Pearlman's bottom line: ``They picked the wrong company.''

<HEAD>Negotiators Agree on Labor Contract; Union Members Vote Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Walt Disney World
and six unions representing 9,200 workers have reached tentative
agreement on a new labor contract, union officials said Wednesday.
   ``Considering the alternatives, we feel that this is a contract
we can recommend'' to union members, said Harvey Totzke, president
of the unions' Service Trades Council.
   But neither side would disclose details of the pact.
   Union members will vote by ballot on the proposed contract later
this week.
   The council had sought across-the-board wage increases while
Disney was offering a combination of wage hikes and bonuses. Union
members had earlier defeated a Disney offer for a 4 percent wage
increase in the contract's first year, with a 2 percent pay raise
combined with a 2 percent bonus in each of the pact's final two
years.
   ``There are no bonuses'' in the newest agreement, Totzke said.
   Wages now range from $4.85 to $9.70 an hour for union members,
who include food servers, custodians, stagehands, bus drivers, meat
cutters, housekeepers and those who portray the Disney characters.

   The stock market finished lower today in mostly
quiet trading, pressured by the dollar's persistent slide against
other major currencies.
   After seesawing gently up and down through most of the session,
stocks took a sudden downturn in the early afternoon. Analysts
attributed the move mainly to the dollar, which fell despite a third
straight day of dollar purchases in the open market by the Federal
Reserve.
   Stock investors are nervous that the dollar's decline could move
the Fed to bolster the currency by nudging interest rates higher.
Many market watchers had been anticipating stable interest rates
recently, as the economy showed signs of slowing down.
   The U.S. currency's fall is ``making people very, very nervous,''
said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp. in
Albany, N.Y. ``It obviously puts enormous pressure on the Federal
Reserve.''
   Stocks also were hit by an upward spike in prices of gold and
other key commodities, analysts said. The commodity price rise
rekindled anxiety about inflationary pressures.
   ``All of a sudden, the long-dormant terror about inflation (was)
revived here,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co.
   Through most of the trading day, activity continued to be
dampened by the market's anticipation of upcoming events: notably
Friday's release of U.S. unemployment data for October and the
presidential election next Tuesday.
   ``People are on the sidelines looking towards Friday,'' said
Philip Puccio, a senior vice president of Dillon, Read & Co.
   Wall Street shrugged off today's report that U.S. productivity
rose by an annual rate of 1.3 percent from July through September,
reversing a second-quarter decline.
   The government also reported that factory orders fell 1.9 percent
and sales of new homes declined 7.8 percent in September, signs of a
decelerating economy.

<TEXT>
   Venezuela said Wednesday that it will
obtain a $1 billion loan secured by oil sales of two U.S. oil
refining companies it partly owns.
   The loan through Bank of America and Salomon Brothers Inc. is the
first in Venezuela to link oil revenues directly to repayment, said
Finance Minister Hector Hurtado Navarro.
   ``This operation will not affect the income of our oil company,
it will not affect oil prices and it will not generate additional
fiscal income. It is so we don't keep eating up our international
reserves,'' Hurtado told a news conference.
   The operation was approved in Wednesday's regular cabinet
meeting, he said.
   According to Hurtado, a New York trust fund will be established
for the Central Bank of Venezuela, which will receive payments from
Champlin Oil Refining Co. and Citgo Petroleum Co. under seven-year
crude oil contracts the refiners have with the state oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).
   PDVSA owns half of both refining firms, and recently announced it
will exercise an option to buy the other half of Champlin for around
$70 million.
   Combined the companies purchase around 200,000 barrels per day of
crude oil from PDVSA, or around 6 million barrels a month, Hurtado
said. The monthly payments on the oil currently amount to around $78
million, based on oil prices of around $13 per barrel, he said.

<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. directors tried to flush out
more offers for the giant consumer products company Wednesday by
issuing a statement saying they are interested in reviewing
acquisition proposals.
   The announcement came more than a week after Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. launched an unprecedented $20.3 billion tender offer
for Nabisco. The aggressive New York buyout firm is offering to pay
$90 a share for the company under the condition that Nabisco
management approve the deal.
   A statement issued by a special committee of Nabisco's board said
it is interested in hearing from ``credible parties wishing to
present (acquisition) proposals.''
   Charles Hugel, who chairs the committee of outside directors that
was appointed to review takeover proposals, said the group believes
``this will serve the best interest of all shareholders.''
   A spokesman for Nabisco characterized the committee's statement
as ``very responsible. They want to make sure the world knows if
anyone wants to make an offer.''
   But market observers have said it was unlikely that a higher
offer would emerge. Some even have acknowledged the possibility that
Kohlberg Kravis, which has begun to receive a stream of financial
data from Nabisco, might even lower its bid after reviewing the
material.
   Nabisco executives and their primary financial partner, Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., were believed to be working on a
counter-proposal to Kohlberg Kravis's bid, which would be the
largest corporate acquisition in U.S. history.
   But there was no indication that the group would be able to match
the Kohlberg Kravis offer.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nabisco rose $1.75 to
close at $86.75 a share on Wednesday.
   Two weeks ago, Nabisco Chief Executive F. Ross Johnson and
Shearson Lehman said they were considering a $75-a-share, $17
billion deal to take the company private. Since then, the company
has also signed up Salomon Brothers Inc. as adviser and financial
partner.
   Rumors on Wall Street circulated that Kohlberg Kravis might be
under pressure to withdraw from the bidding process. Several
institutional investors in the firm's leveraged buyout fund, which
would provide a small part of the financing for the takeover, are
balking on the grounds that the firm's approach is hostile.
   Typically, Kohlberg Kravis works with management members, who are
instrumental in running a target company after it is acquired.

   The dollar tumbled again Wednesday despite
reported efforts by the U.S. and Japanese central banks to support
the currency.
   Gold prices shot upward. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold bullion was bid at $420.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up
sharply from $411.30 an ounce late Tuesday.
   The dollar's fall brought it to a six-month low against the
Japanese yen and five-month lows against other major currencies.
   Traders said dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and the
Federal Reserve were only partially successful because market
participants felt the central banks were trying to slow the U.S.
currency's fall, not arrest it.
   ``The markets are interpreting this as a smoothing operation,''
said Randy Kaplan, a dealer for National Australia Bank Ltd. in New
York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.62 Japanese yen to 124.68 yen. Later
in London, the dollar edged back up to 124.82 yen. At the end of the
trading day in New York, the dollar fell to 124.40 yen from 125.07
yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7740 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7668 late Tuesday.
In New York, the pound rose to $1.7805 from $1.7698.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7750 West German marks, down from 1.7840; 1.4898
Swiss francs, down from 1.4982; 1.2261 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2274; 6.0470 French francs, down from 6.0895; and 1,319.88 Italian
lire, down from 1,325.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's late
rates, included: 1.7840 West German marks, down from 1.7865; 1.4975
Swiss francs, down from 1.5025; 6.0885 French francs, down from
6.0965; 2.0193 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0155; 1,322.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,331.50; and 1.2275 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2278.
   Gold and silver prices were led upward by a continuing
speculative surge in the price of platinum as well as the dollar's
weakness, said Brian Donohue, a gold trader in New York for Midland
Montagu Metals.
   ``Gold was overdue for a breakout. They've been talking the
metals down so long that a lot of people were caught short,''
Donohue said.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $413.90 a troy ounce, up from
$413.89 at Tuesday's close.
   Later in Zurich, gold rose to $417 an ounce from $411 late
Tuesday. In London, gold rose to a late bid of $417.20 a troy ounce
from $411.25 late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $421.80 a troy ounce from $411.60 Tuesday.
   Silver bullion jumped in London to a late bid of $6.45 a troy
ounce, up from $6.28 late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $6.488 a troy ounce from $6.293.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest medical association on
Wednesday sought to halt distribution of a ``smokeless cigarette,''
saying it should be removed from shelves until it is judged ``safe
for human consumption.''
   The American Medical Association filed legal petitions with state
health authorities in Arizona and Missouri _ where the product is
being test marketed _ contending that the smokeless cigarette is a
``new, hazardous'' drug that needs further testing.
   The product, dubbed ``Premier'' by manufacturer R.J. Reynolds
Co., contains nicotine, an ``addictive drug ... which has been
implicated in cardiovascular disease,'' high blood pressure and
other medical problems, the AMA said.
   ``The scientific evidence is crystal clear about the adverse
health effects of nicotine and carbon monoxide,'' Dr. Roy Schwarz of
the AMA said at a news conference.
   R.J. Reynolds responded with a news release condending that
``Premier is a cigarette ... not a drug-delivery system, as the AMA
has alleged.''
   ``Premier smoke substantially reduces many of the chemical
compounds that the critics of smoking have been complaining about
...,'' the release said. ``Reynolds finds it difficult to understand
how the AMA can in good faith suggest that Premier be banned.''
   The petitions, filed Wednesday with the Arizona Board of Pharmacy
and the Missouri Department of Health, maintain that Premier ``is a
new drug that is being sold ... without prior (federal) regulatory
approval.''
   Neither state responded to the petitions immediately, but each
state's laws require it to answer eventually, said AMA attorney
Michael Zarski. If officials in either state decided to pull the
product, they would be required to obtain a court injunction, he
said.
   ``The American public has the right to expect that the products
they consume have been judged safe for human consumption before
being placed on the shelves for sale,'' said Dr. James Sammons, AMA
executive vice president.
   Company spokeswoman Maura Payne in Winston-Salem, N.C., said the
company is making no medical claims for the product and therefore
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration needn't approve it in advance.
   The main difference between Premier and other cigarettes ``is
that the tobacco is warmed, not burned,'' Ms. Payne said.
   ``We're not claiming that `Premier' is safe or safer than any
other cigarettes on the market,'' she said.
   She said the cigarettes contain a nicotine level of 0.4
milligrams and carbon monoxide ``at about the same level as a
`lights' brand.''
   In April, the AMA asked the FDA in a petition to regulate the new
product as a drug, although cigarettes are not ordinarily regulated.
The petition is still pending.
   ``There's nothing in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which
mentions tobacco,'' said FDA spokesman William Grigg. ``We have
never regulated tobacco products unless they made a medical or
drug-type claim.''
   The AMA maintains in its FDA petition that Premier makes ``an
inherent health claim'' and should be regulated, Grigg said.
   Zarski said the key to FDA jurisdiction of Premier is that it is
``intended to satisfy nicotine addiction and therefore should be
treated as a drug.''
   R.J. Reynolds Co., a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco, said it has
treated Premier no differently from any other cigarette.
   ``What the company has said is that there is no health claim and
that it is putting on this cigarette all the same warnings that are
on regular cigarettes,'' Grigg said.
   The FDA has six months from receiving the petition to respond,
though final action could take much longer, Grigg said.
   The company began selling Premier in Tucson, Phoenix and St.
Louis around Oct. 1, but no date had been set for national
distribution. Ms. Payne said the cost would run about 25 percent
higher than other cigarettes.
   In Arizona, the AMA petition had been forwarded to the state
attorney general's office for review, said Joe Rowan, deputy
director of the state's Board of Pharmacy. ``They will advise the
board as to what action they can take or should take, if any,'' he
said.
   Dr. Robert Harmon, director of the Missouri Department of Health,
did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment.

<HEAD>Platinum, Other Precious Metals Soar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of precious metals futures soared Wednesday as heavy
buying of platinum by the Japanese pushed the metal's price to a
4{-month high and triggered strong rallies in the gold and silver
markets.
   On other markets, copper futures leaped to record highs; soybean
prices surged while grain futures finished mostly higher; livestock
and meat prices were mixed; energy futures were higher and
stock-index futures advanced.
   Platinum for delivery in January settled at $578.60 a troy ounce
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, $15.40 above Tuesday's final
price. The January contract's price reached $582.50 during the
session, the highest price for a nearby platinum contract since June
21, when July platinum traded at $592 a troy ounce.
   Platinum has been rising steadily since early October, when the
British platinum refiner Johnson Matthey PLC predicted supply
shortfalls this year and for the next four years.
   Analysts attributed Wednesday's unusually strong rally to the
dollar's steep drop against the Japanese yen, which further lowered
the price of platinum in yen terms and sparked heavy Japanese buying
of the physical metal.
   ``They just had a window of opportunity for buying platinum,''
said Sharon Ziemian, a precious metals market analyst with Citibank
in New York.
   The sudden rise widened the gap between platinum's price and that
of lower-priced gold to $160, just $5 short of the all-time high,
said James Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
   The increase in the platinum-to-gold premium was a strong buy
signal for chart-watching ``technical'' traders, Steel said.
   ``Because platinum was racing away like this, everybody said gold
and silver were now undervalued compared to platinum,'' Steel said.
``That helped lift gold, which in turn helped lift silver.''
   Gold and silver futures settled at their highest levels since
mid-September on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $10.20 to $12 higher with December at $424.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 19.5 cents to 20.3 cents higher with December at
$6.53 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures rocketed higher on the Comex in response to new
developments in the 2-week-old copper miners' strike in Peru, the
world's seventh-largest copper producer.
   On Wednesday, the Southern Peru Copper Corp., which controls
two-thirds of Peru's copper production, said it was considering
declaring a ``force majeure'' on shipments. Such a declaration would
mean the company was unable to fulfill its delivery obligations. The
company also announced a delay in scheduled shipments to its
European customers.
   Copper settled 1.40 cents to 5.10 cents higher with the spot
November contract at $1.535 a pound and the more active December
contract at $1.463 a pound.
   Soybean futures prices finished sharply higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade in response to rumors that the Soviet Union had made
a large purchase of U.S. soybeans or soybean meal and was planning
to buy more.
   Talk of Soviet buying also fueled moderate gains in the corn
market, analysts said. Wheat closed mostly higher in quiet trading.
   Analysts said there were indications the Soviets also may have
purchased soybeans from Brazil or Argentina.
   The rumors did not indicate how the Soviet purchases broke down
by country of origin. But of the overall amount, ``the talk is about
500,000 (metric) tons with more bids being put out overnight,'' said
Mario Balletto, soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
in New York.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department said the Soviets had
purchased 250,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans and that another
250,000 metric tons had been sold to unknown destinations.
   Wheat settled \ cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $4.18} a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1} cents higher with December at $2.86{ a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with December at $2.30{
a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents to 18{ cents higher with November
at $7.95\ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .05 cent
lower to .32 cent higher with December at 73.62 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .08 cent higher with November
at 81.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .52 cent higher
with December at 41.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .38
cent to .80 cent higher with February at 47.35 cents a pound.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 23 cents to 31 cents higher with December at
$13.75 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to .24 cent higher with
December at 43.35 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .08 cent to
.30 cent higher with December at 43.79 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures rose slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled .85 point higher at 281.

<HEAD>Court Stays Order Enjoining Interco Poison Pill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware court on Wednesday temporarily halted
the Rales brothers from proceeding with their hostile $2.7 billion
bid for Interco Inc., giving the furniture and apparel company a
chance to appeal a ruling knocking down its poison pill.
   The Delaware Chancery Court granted a stay of its decision
Tuesday to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the company's
poison pill on grounds that it had been improperly used.
   St. Louis-based Interco has said it would appeal. Unless the
ruling is reversed, the brothers are almost certain to win their
4-month-old battle for Interco.
   The Washington, D.C.-based Rales brothers, through Cardinal
Acquisition Corp., have a $74-a-share tender offer outstanding that
is due to expire at midnight Wednesday. It is certain to be
extended, since they are prevented from purchasing any shares while
the stay is in effect.
   But on Wednesday, Cardinal announced that more than 29 million
Interco shares had been tendered. Those shares, coupled with the
Rales's previous holdings, represent 91 percent of the company's
outstanding stock.
   A source close to the Raleses called the stay ``a temporary
setback'' for the brothers. ``The court simply agreed to give more
time to Interco.''
   The Raleses own 8.7 percent of Interco's stock. Their offer is
subject to 75 percent participation among Interco's 36.2 million
shares outstanding as well as the withdrawal of the poison-pill
shareholder rights plan.
   Cardinal, which opened the bidding for Interco at $64 a share
last July, increased its hostile offer from $70 a share to $74 two
weeks ago.
   Several attorneys have remarked on the significance of the
court's original action in blocking the pill. Robert Kohl, a partner
in the New York office of Gaston & Snow, noted that the case
``involves the limits on the strategic use of the pill in the whole
takeover process.''
   The message is that a company cannot use the poison pill as a
defense to preserve its own restructuring while a similar offer is
on the table from an unwanted suitor.
   Interco adopted a poison pill in 1985 but revised it in July
after noticing unusual trading activity in its stock. Days later,
Interco Chairman Harvey Saligman announced he would recommend a
major restructuring.
   In September, Interco countered the Rales's buyout overtures with
a multibillion-dollar defensive restructuring plan valued at $76 a
share, including a special $25-a-share cash dividend to shareholders.
   Kohl noted, however, that the Interco restructuring ``had a lot
of funny money in it _ besides cash, there are three kinds of debt,
one kind of preferred stock and one stub stock. It's very hard for a
board to say that $74 in cash is wholly inadequate and $76 in funny
money is adequate.''
   Kohl speculated that if the Interco restructuring had been valued
$20 higher than the Rales's offer, Chancellor William T. Allen might
have decided differently.
   In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Interco fell 75
cents to close at $71 a share.
   Interco manufactures men's and women's apparel, footwear,
furniture and home furnishings. Among the company's main brands are
London Fog rainwear, Ethan Allen furniture and Florsheim shoes.
   Company sales for the first half of the current fiscal year were
$1.27 billion, up 3 percent from 1987.

   The stock market finished mixed in seesaw trading
Wednesday, pressured by the dollar's persistent slide against other
major currencies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.87 points to
2,156.83. The blue-chip indicator had been down more than 10 points
at 2:30 p.m. EST.
   The broader market ended lower. Declining issues edged out
advances by around 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 842
issues down, 598 up and 543 unchanged.
   After bobbing up and down through most of the session, stocks
took a sudden brisk downturn in the early afternoon. Analysts
attributed the move mainly to the dollar, which fell despite a third
straight day of dollar purchases in the open market by the Federal
Reserve.
   Stock investors are nervous that the dollar's decline could move
the Fed to bolster the currency by nudging interest rates higher.
Many market watchers had been anticipating stable interest rates
recently, as the economy showed signs of slowing down.
   The U.S. currency's fall is ``making people very, very nervous,''
said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp. in
Albany, N.Y. ``It obviously puts enormous pressure on the Federal
Reserve.''
   The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at around 124.40
Japanese yen, down from 125.07 yen late Tuesday.
   Stocks also were hit by an upward spike in prices of gold and
other key commodities, analysts said. The commodity price rise
rekindled anxiety about inflationary pressures.
   ``All of a sudden, the long-dormant terror about inflation (was)
revived here,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co.
   Through most of the trading day, activity continued to be
dampened by the market's anticipation of upcoming events: notably
Friday's release of U.S. unemployment data for October and the
presidential election next Tuesday.
   ``People are on the sidelines looking towards Friday,'' said
Philip Puccio, a senior vice president of Dillon, Read & Co.
   Wall Street shrugged off the report that U.S. productivity rose
by an annual rate of 1.3 percent from July through September,
reversing a second-quarter decline.
   The government also reported that factory orders fell 1.9 percent
and sales of new homes declined 7.8 percent in September, signs of a
decelerating economy.
   Once again, there were unsubstantiated rumors in the market of
possible publication of reports that could damage Republican
presidential prospects. This time the rumors centered on vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle. But they were not as widespread
as two weeks ago and had little or no effect on the market. The
rumor two weeks ago involved Vice President George Bush and was
quickly denied.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 161.30 million shares, up
from 151.25 million in Tuesday's session. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional
exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 190.64 million
shares.
   The NYSE's composite index edged up 0.02 to 157.00.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Reebok jumped 1[ to
14[, RJR Nabisco advanced 1} to 86}, Kraft rose | to 103{, General
Motors was up ~ at 84~ and Sears Roebuck gained 1\ at 43.
   American Express was unchanged at 27] and Ford Motor slipped [ to
51].
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.11 to 321.35, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was unchanged at 279.06.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up
0.27 at 299.83. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 381.78, down 0.57.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, was down $3.072 billion.

<HEAD>FAA Awards Contract to Raytheon For Wind Shear Radar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on
Wednesday awarded a $180 million contract to Raytheon Co. for
installation of special radar equipment to detect wind shears at
major airports beginning in the early l990s.
   Powerful wind shears called microbursts have been the cause of at
least five airline accidents that claimed more than 500 lives in the
last 15 years, including the l985 crash of a Delta Air Lines jet
that killed 137 people near Dallas.
   The contract calls for installation of so-called Doppler radar,
which can detect such shears, at 47 major airports at a cost of $180
million over a number of years.
   The agency also said it has an option for 55 additional radars at
other airports, costing another $100 million, although no final
decision has yet been made to expand the program beyond the original
group of 47 airports.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the agency could provide no list
of the airports because the location of the radars has yet to be
determined. Agency officials previously have said airports with
heavy traffic loads and susceptibility to wind shears would be given
the greatest priority.
   ``The terminal Doppler system has a greater potential for
realizing safety gains than perhaps any other individual item of
equipment (in the FAA's air traffic modernization program),'' said
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley in a statement.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the introduction of the
radar along the approach and departure paths of major airports is
``a major step'' in providing controllers and pilots with better and
quicker adverse weather warnings.
   A wind shear is a sudden change of wind direction that causes a
powerful downburst of air much like water gushing from a faucet. The
downward gust of air is strong enough to literally drive a jetliner
into the ground when it is at a low altitude such as when landing or
departing.
   Under the multiyear contract, Raytheon's Equipment Division at
Wayland, Mass., will provide the first terminal Doppler radar to the
FAA's Technical Center in Atlantic City, N.J., in the fall of l991
with the first radar for airport delivery in late l992, the FAA said.
   The FAA has had mechanical wind monitoring equipment at many
major airports for a number of years, but experts have said the
equipment cannot cover along the entire approach and takoff paths
used by jetliners and, therefore, is of minimal benefit.
   The wind monitors were in use at the Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport when a Delta Air Lines Lockheed L-1011
encountered a powerful microburst during an approach Aug. 2, 1985
causing it to crash and kill 137 people.
   The mechanical monitors also were at the New Orleans airport on
July 9, l982 when a Pan American World Airways jet encountered a
wind shear as it took off. The Boeing 727 crashed, killing 153
people.

<HEAD>Coors Reports 7.5 Percent Profit Increase; Record Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors Co. said Wednesday its
third-quarter profit rose 7.5 percent, helped by the company's
recent geographic expansion and healthy growth of Coors Light beer.
   For the three-month period ended Oct. 2, Coors said its after-tax
profit totaled $21.6 million, or 59 cents a share, up from $20.1
million, or 55 cents a share, in the 1987 third quarter.
   The Golden, Colo.-based company said it had record revenue of
$497.95 million for the quarter, up 15 percent from $432.76 million
in the year-ago period.
   Coors said the company's geographical expansion, a 10 percent
increase in Coors Light sales and the addition of new products
accounted for the quarter's gains. Sales in New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware exceeded expectations, the company said.
   However, Coors profit has risen only a fraction since January due
to high advertising and marketing expenditures, Coors said.
   ``The costs of maintaining a high-visibility advertising and
marketing program, along with costs associated with the 1988 market
expansion and product rollouts, continued to impact earnings,'' said
Coors Chairman William K. Coors.
   For the first nine months of the year, Coors net income totaled
$44.64 million, or $1.22 a share, compared with $44.49 million, or
$1.22 per share, for the same period in 1987. Revenue totaled $1.2
billion, up 9 percent from $1.1 billion in the same 1987 period.
   The company also said it declared a quarterly dividend of 12{
cents a share payable Nov. 15 to shareholders of record on Oct. 31,
1988.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Complies With FTC Request On Kraft Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said Wednesday it would
comply with a federal government request for additional corporate
information on its proposed $13.1 billion takeover of Kraft Inc.
   The Federal Trade Commission, which along with the Justice
Department reviews mergers for possible antitrust problems, already
had been reviewing the proposal to merge the two giant food and
consumer products companies.
   Philip Morris indicated it had submitted corporate information to
the FTC after announcing its $106-a-share tender offer for Kraft and
was asked late Wednesday for further information.
   In a statement, Murray Bring, Philip Morris senior vice president
and general counsel, said the company did not consider the request
out of the ordinary, especially considering the size of the deal.
   He also reiterated the company's position that it did not believe
the acquisition would violate antitrust laws aimed at upholding
competition.
   The proposed buyout of Kraft, which is based in Glenview, Ill.,
would create the world's largest consumer products company and
second largest food company. Philip Morris already is the parent of
General Foods, the nation's biggest food processer.
   A combined company would have $40 billion a year in revenue and
some of America's best-known consumer products, including Miller
beer, Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O, Maxwell House coffee, Velveeta
cheese, Parkay margarine, Philadelphia cream cheese, Miracle Whip
salad dressing and Sealtest ice cream.
   There have been some questions over whether the combined company
would affect competition in the sale of prepared foods, notably by
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights.
   Philip Morris officials have said the two companies do not sell
competing lines of products, and Bring contended Wednesday that the
combined company would account for no more than 5 percent to 6
percent of total sales of all supermarket products.

<HEAD>FCC Approves RKO Sale of Two Stations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday granted RKO General Inc.'s settlement agreement for
WRKO-AM and WROR-FM in Boston, ending a protracted dispute with the
agency over alleged misconduct.
   Under the agreement, Atlantic Ventures of Boston would pay $27.7
million for the stations, of which $17.5 million would go to RKO and
the rest would go to other applicants that competed for the licenses.
   ``The public interest is better served in this case by ending
this uniquely protracted litigation _ which threatens to continue
for many years to come _ so that RKO can withdraw as a licensee and
an unquestionably qualified licensee ... can take over the ownership
of the stations and operate them without a cloud of uncertainty
hanging over its head,'' the FCC said.
   RKO, a unit of Akron, Ohio-based GenCorp Inc., has been embroiled
in a legal battle with the FCC that dates back to 1965 concerning
the company's fitness to operate broadcast stations.
   The FCC in 1980 refused to renew RKO's license for WNAC-TV in
Boston, saying the company was unqualified to run the station. RKO's
radio and TV stations in other cities are under challenge.
   The commission said the settlement, which gives RKO only 63
percent of the proceeds of the sale, would serve as a deterrent for
other stations that may engage in misconduct.
   An FCC administrative law judge last year ruled that the 14 radio
and TV licenses RKO held should be revoked because of allegations of
fraudulent billing and other improprieties by the company.
   The FCC has indicated it would rule on the question by the end of
this year unless the company reached settlements for all the
stations. If RKO lost the licenses for the broadcast properties,
their value would drop considerably.

<HEAD>Company Stock Plunges On Lower Earnings Expectations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc.'s stock price
plunged by nearly half Wednesday after the company said it was
dramatically boosting its provision for asbestos damage claim
liability and as a result would post a big net loss for this year.
   The diversified manufacturing company, which also said it was
suspending its common stock dividend, said the plan would result in
a negative net worth.
   The company's stock tumbled $13.50 to close at $15 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange, a 47 percent drop.
   Eagle-Picher said it would boost its $59 million provision for
current and future asbestos liability by $554 million. The company
also plans to sell three divisions for an estimated $85 million.
   Eagle-Picher said the plan would reduce its earnings per share _
$3.70 in 1987 _ by about $46.70 a share in 1988, and reduce
shareholders equity by $499 million.
   Eagle-Picher posted third quarter net income of $30.7 million, or
$2.87 per share, on revenue of $567.2 million.
   While accounting will indicate a negative net worth on its Nov.
30, 1988 balance sheet, management believes the assets of
Eagle-Picher have a fair value in excess of their book value and
that Eagle-Picher will remain solvent on a fair value basis, the
company said.
   The company, which also said it was suspending its 28 cents a
share quarterly common stock dividend, also plans to keep operating
while it deals with the claims.
   In 1985, there were 8,900 asbestos claims against Eagle-Picher,
11,900 in 1986 and 20,800 in 1987. The company projects that claims
are continuing at about the same rate this year as in 1987.
   The claims stemmed from an asbestos pipe compound Eagle-Picher
produced for the ship building industry, at the request of the
government, beginning in World War II.
   Asbestos has been linked to lung diseases which show up years
after exposure.
   Eagle-Picher said it planned to sell its Bearings, Chi-Vit and
A.D. Weiss Lithograph Co. divisions. Those divisions annually
account for a total $9.6 million in pre-tax earnings and $109
million in revenue.
   Thomas E. Petry, Eagle-Picher president, said the company has had
to re-evaluate its asbestos liability which was established in 1985.
   ``The company is vigorously pursuing both legislative and legal
initiatives to resolve this issue,'' Petry said.

   Wendy's International Inc. said Wednesday its
third-quarter profit climbed 74 percent from a year earlier on a
slight rise in revenue.
   The fast-food restaurant company's net income for the quarter was
$8.7 million, or 9 cents per share, compared with $5 million, or 5
cents per share for the same quarter a year ago, the company
reported. Revenue was $273.7 million, up from $272.2 million.
   Systemwide sales _ the total sales from company and franchise
restaurants _ were $769 million for the quarter, an increase from
$742 million during the same quarter a year ago, the company said.
   Robert L. Barney, Wendy's chairman and chief executive, said the
company had effective purchasing agreements and better cost controls
at the restaurant level.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, net income was
$21.7 million, or 23 cents per share, versus $130,000 for the same
period last year. Revenue was $802.3 million, compared with $799.3
million a year earlier.
   Systemwide sales for the nine months totalled $2.2 billion,
compared with $2.1 billion the previous year.
   ``Our efforts to improve customer satisfaction and control
operating costs are producing the desired results,'' Barney said.
``I'm confident this will continue to be a strong turnaround years
for Wendy's.''
   The company made $4.5 million in profits in 1987 and lost $4.9
million the previous year.
   Wendy's said there were 3,760 Wendy's restaurants worldwide at
the end of the third quarter. There are 3,600 restaurants in the
United States.

<HEAD>Blue Cross To Market Credit Card for Medical Expenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BRANDLON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A credit card devoted exclusively to medical and
dental expenses that insurance companies won't cover was unveiled
Wednesday by a subsidiary of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland.
   Instead of paying by cash or check, patients can use the card to
pay for a school physical examination, a bottleof medicine or the
deductible on a health insurance policy, said Jack Rapport,
president of Health Line Inc., a subsidiary of the insurance company.
   The card, which is called Medcash, can also be used for
preventive health care, such as routine doctor visits, weight-loss
clinics and home blood-pressure kits.
   ``Consumers are paying for these expenses largely out of pocket.
... There's an awful lot of health care that can be purchased that
is not covered by insurance,'' Rapport said.
   Health Line plans to market the card throughout Maryland during
the next year and eventually offer it nationwide through other state
Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans.
   More than 300 health care professionals and hospitals agreed to
accept the card during its test-marketing in Baltimore.
   Most major medical institutions are ``hesitant to accept
commercial or retail credit cards for professional services ...
because of the commercialism that could be associated with that,''
Rapport said. ``(But) Blue Cross-Blue Shield already has an
extensive relationship with virtually all major providers,'' and 85
percent of the providers asked to accept the Medcash card agreed to
do so.
   The company started by offering the card to its employees, and
about 1,000 of them signed up, Rapport said.
   The card, Rapport said, allows patients to separate health care
expenditures from retail purchases and provides a form of insurance
against unforeseen medical expenses. Card holders also can request a
year-end summary of health care spending for their tax records.
   The card offers initial credit of $1,000 to $5,000, with the
possibility of obtaining additional coverage in an emergency by way
of a toll-free telephone number.
   A $24 annual charge will be waived the first year, the company
said.
   No interest will be charged if the balance is paid within 25
days. The company charges 7 percent more than the prime lending rate
on unpaid balances and offers a three-year repayment plan, the
company said. The prime rate is around 10 percent.
   Rapport said the card offers an advantage to health care
providers by cutting the time and money they spend on bill
collection.

<HEAD>FCC Board Revokes Licenses for Two Georgia Radio Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Communications Commission review
board on Wednesday revoked the licenses for two Georgia radio
stations charging that their owner abused the agency's policy on
distress sales to minorities.
   The FCC review board accused Silver Star Communications-Albany
Inc., of ``callous abuse'' of the process that allows a licensee
facing revocation to sell their station to qualified minorities at a
discounted price.
   The board, in an Oct. 18 ruling released Wednesday, reversed a
decision by an administrative law judge and revoked the licenses for
WMJM-AM and WFAV-FM in Cordele, Ga.
   Silver Star can appeal the ruling to the commission within 30
days. John Robert E. Lee, the principal of Silver Star, could not be
reached for comment Wednesday evening.
   The FCC rarely revokes radio and TV station licenses. It has done
so a total of 40 times since 1939, commission spokeswoman Maureen
Peratino said.
   Silver Star bought the stations and two others _ WTJH-AM, East
Point, Ga., and WJIZ-FM, Albany, Ga. _ from James S. Rivers and
members of the Rivers family in 1984. The stations had been
designated for a license renewal hearing because of allegations that
Rivers had misrepresented issues before the FCC.
   In light of the pending hearing, Rivers' sought a discounted
distress sale of the stations and settled upon Lee as a minority
buyer.
   The FCC said the record in the case showed that Lee was primarily
interested in buying WJIZ and that he intended to sell the three
other stations as soon as possible after acquisition.
   The commission also said the record showed that Rivers suggested
that Lee sell the Cordele stations to River's son, Ronald Rivers, a
minority shareholder in the Cordele stations, and Sara Howell, a
Rivers employee.
   The review board said Silver Star abused the distress sale policy
by acquiring at least two stations it did not wish to own or operate
and defying an FCC policy requiring it to maintain those stations
for at least a year before transferring control.
   Additionally, the board noted that Silver Star transferred
control ``to an individual Silver Star knew to have questionable FCC
credentials,'' since Rivers had an interest in the Cordele stations
when they were under investigation by the FCC.
   The FCC review board found that Silver Star ``willfully subverted
the underlying intended purpose of that process. It said the
company's ``willful violation (of the policy) is compounded by
conduct fully as egregious as misrepresentation or lack of candor,
and equally as telling as to its trustworthiness.''

<HEAD>Allegheny International Approves Reorganization Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>

   Allegheny International, Inc.'s said Wednesday
its board of directors had approved a plan to emerge from bankruptcy
court protection by selling a substantial interest in the company to
a New York brokerage firm.
   Chairman Oliver S. Travers said Allegheny International would be
merged with a new company to be formed by Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp., with the brokerage contributing $75
million to refinance Allegheny's operations and getting an
unspecified stake in the company in return.
   ``This proposal...brings improved values to the company's
shareholders and creditors,'' Travers said. ``It should hasten our
emerging from Chapter 11...''
   Under the plan _ which must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court and other parties in the reorganization _ Allegheny's current
shareholders would get 25 percent of the new company's stock and the
right to buy another 15 percent at the same price paid by Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette.
   The firm also would have the right to add 20-25 percent to the
unspecified interest it would get for its $75 million. The firm
described its initial holding only as substantial.
   Allegheny said it anticipated the plan would provide $698.2
million, consisting of about $537.6 million in cash and $160.6
million in securities, to be distributed to its creditors.
   The company, best known for its Oster and Sunbeam appliances,
filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code on
Feb. 20, 1988, claiming debts of $845 million.
   The proposal provides for negotiations to settle various claims
against the company.
   The plan would be financed through a combination of cash at
Allegheny, bank financing, securities and the brokerage firm's $75
million investment.
   Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette is an independently operated, wholly
owned subsidiary of The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
United States.

<HEAD>Boeing, Polish Airline Schedule Announcement; May Be Aircraft Order</HEAD>

   Boeing Co. and LOT Polish Airlines have
scheduled what they term a major announcement Friday in New York,
amid indications LOT may be ordering Boeing airliners, opening a new
Eastern European market.
   Boeing officials declined to comment Wednesday on any prospective
LOT aircraft order, and representatives for LOT could not be reached
by telephone.
   But spokesmen for Boeing's commercial aircraft division said
earlier this year that they hoped to sell widebody 767 aircraft to
LOT and to other communist-bloc nations.
   While neither confirming nor denying a deal was in the works,
Boeing spokesman John Wheeler said Wednesday that a LOT order would
be the first purchase by a Warsaw Pact nation of new-technology
commercial aircraft.
   Sources indicated any order might be for two or three of the
aircraft, which sell for $50 million to $70 million each, depending
on model.
   This summer, Boeing and three other major Western airplane
manufacturers _ McDonnell Douglas, British Aerospace and Airbus
Industrie _ were granted permission by the Coordinating Committee
for Multilateral Export Control to sell new-generation commercial
jets to Eastern Bloc countries. The Paris-based organization
regulates strategic exports to communist-bloc countries by Western
industrialized nations.
   At the time, Boeing spokesman Bill Clark said Boeing hoped to
sell three widebody 767s to LOT and two 767s to Tarom airline of
Romania. He said there also had been discussions with Malev of
Hungary and Interflug of East Germany.
   Wheeler said Boeing still was discussing a possible 767 sale to
Tarom. And he said Malev has leased Boeing 737s, a smaller twinjet,
through a third party.
   Any sales to Eastern Bloc nations must be approved by the U.S.
departments of State, Commerce and Defense, to ensure that
technology with critical military applications is not transferred to
communist countries.
   Yugoslavia's JAT airline long has been a customer of Boeing's, as
has the Chinese government. Tarom also bought two 707s from Boeing
in 1973.
   Richard Albrecht, Boeing Commercial Airplanes executive vice
president for sales and marketing, in an interview Wednesday would
not discuss any specific negotiations with possible customers, other
to say, ``We're hopeful of receiving some orders from Eastern
European companies.''
   Boeing also would like to sell jets to the Soviet Union, Albrecht
said.
   He said Boeing had talked to the Soviets in the mid-1970s about
selling some airplanes, but nothing ever came of it. However, he
said Boeing officials again talked with Soviet aircraft industry
representatives last year at a San Diego air show.
   ``The largest airline in the world is Aeroflot (the Soviet
national carrier) and I would think that we have some products that
could provide some value to them,'' Albrecht said. ``Whether or not
they would buy them or we could come up with acceptable terms to
satisfy our government with respect to technology transfer is a
question that is up, to a certain degree, to the Soviet Union and
the U.S. government.
   Albrecht said he ``can't imagine the Soviet Union would under any
circumstances permit Aeroflot to rely primarily on aircraft from
outside the Soviet bloc, at least not in today's world.''
   But because Aeroflot is so huge, with thousands of aircraft
ranging from helicopters to transcontinental jets, even if Boeing
supplied only a fraction of its needs, ``it would be very
significant,'' Albrecht said.
