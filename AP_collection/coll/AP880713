   A magistrate on Wednesday ordered the Coast Guard
to turn over tapes of its seizure of a marijuana-laden cargo ship
to attorneys defending the vessel's 18 crewmen.
   Defense attorneys had requested to see and hear hours of video
and audio tapes to prove their claim that the Coast Guard boarded
the ship and arrested the 18-man crew without probable cause.
   The attorneys began reviewing the tapes Wednesday afternoon
after the order from U.S. Magistrate John Weinberg.
   The Coast Guard seized the cargo ship Encounter Bay on June 30
about 500 miles off the Washington coast. It was carrying an
estimated 72 tons of marijuana with a street value of about $280
million, making it the largest maritime drug bust on the West Coast.
   Defense attorneys had asked to review all communications
regarding the vessel's seizure, but Weinberg declined the request
after Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Diskin said much of the
material was classified.
   Among material not released was the first of two messages to the
Boutwell indicating that the Panamanian Embassy in Washington,
D.C., gave the Coast Guard permission to board the Encounter Bay,
which was registered in Panama.
   Raul San Malo, Panamanian Embassy minister, told The Associated
Press that permission to disable with gunfire, board and search the
vessel had been granted by Ambassador Juan Sosa.
   Sosa is recognized as ambassador by the U.S. government, but not
by Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian military leader who has been
indicted on drug-related charges in Florida.
   If probable cause is found, crew members would face charges of
possession with intent to distribute marijuana, which carries a
penalty of 10 years to life in prison, Diskin said.
   Diskin also began presenting arguments to continue to detain the
crewmen, who include three Americans, one Englishman, one New
Zealander and 13 from Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore.
   Jeffrey Bernard Press, 41, a British citizen who lives in
Singapore, and Anthony Gilbert Sayers, 53, of Auckland, New
Zealand, have a long association with the Encounter Bay as master
and chief officer, respectively, Diskin said.
   Samuel J. Colflesh, 31, of Springfield, Pa., ``... admitted
being the master at least on this voyage,'' Diskin said.
   As for Terrance Albert Nolan, 36, who gave an address in New
Orleans, and Gary Robinson, 34, of Missouri, ``the reasons for
their presence aboard the vessel is connected only with the
contraband aboard because there's no evidence of them being part of
the crew,'' Diskin said.
   Five of the Southeast Asian crewmen aboard the Encounter Bay
appeared to have worked on the ship for years, Diskin said. The
backgrounds of the other Southeast Asian crewmen was not known, he
said.
   On Tuesday, Lt. Thomas Rogers testified the Coast Guard had
information indicating that the high-grade Thai marijuana was
loaded off Danang, Vietnam, during the first 10 days of June, and
that the Vietnamese army was involved in the operation.
   No questions about Vietnam's alleged involvement were raised in
court Wednesday, but in a telephone interview Tuesday night with
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Be An, second secretary to the
Vietnamese consul general in Mexico City, denied the Coast Guard
account.
   ``The problem is this: Some people don't tell the truth,'' he
said. ``They've been caught. They could say any old thing.
   ``Our government doesn't permit drug trafficking. We've never
had an interest dealing with these drug (operations).''

   A helicopter carrying oil workers from
an offshore platform ditched in the North Sea in rough weather
Wednesday after an engine caught fire, but all 21 aboard were
rescued, the coast guard said.
   No injuries were reported among the two crewmembers and 19
passengers who were on their way to Sumburgh in the remote Shetland
Islands, 150 miles north of the Scottish mainland, the coast guard
said.
   After taking off from Shell Oil's Safe Felicia accomodation
platform near the North Cormorant oil rig, 75 miles northeast of
Sumburgh, the pilot of the S61 Sikorsky helicopter discovered one
engine afire, officials said.
   The pilot radioed for help and made a controlled descent onto
the ocean surface 17 miles east of Lerwick in the Shetlands,
despite rain, rough water, and heavy winds.
   The helicopter stayed afloat long enough for the passengers to
don survival suits and get into life rafts. Within 30 minutes they
were picked up by rescue helicopters and a lifeboat, said Bob
McQueen, general manager of British International Helicopters in
Aberdeen.
   Among the rescuers were men who took part in the rescue mission
after last week's Piper Alpha explosion and fire in the North Sea _
the world's worst oil rig disaster, in which 166 men were killed.
Sixty-four were saved.

   A former City Council member who helped bring
the Dodgers to Los Angeles is crying foul over what she says is a
law firm's refusal to play fair with eight baseball season tickets.
   Rosalind Wyman is suing the firm of Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel and
Silbert, where her husband worked until he died in 1973.
   Mrs. Wyman appeared Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court
and said the firm gave her use of the tickets in the 1960s and that
she signed an agreement when her husband died that gave her right
of first refusal of the tickets and the right to buy them if the
firm didn't.
   Mrs. Wyman contends the firm gave away two of the tickets and
failed to give her access to the rest.
   Law firm spokesman Charles Stern said he had not seen a copy of
the complaint, but added: ``I was dismayed she felt she had to sue
since I had been negotiating with her and her attorneys for many
weeks and we were very close to an arrangement that would have made
everybody happy.''
   ``There's principle involved,'' said Mrs. Wyman, who served on
the City Council from 1953 to 1965 and was instrumental in the
Dodgers' move from Brooklyn in 1958. At 22 she was the youngest
person ever elected to the council.
   ``One of my biggest and longest and most involved fights was to
bring a major league baseball team to this city as an elected
official. I really feel I made a contribution to my community.''
   The Dodgers are in first place in the National League West, 2{
games ahead of San Francisco.

<TEXT>
   Volkswagen opened its only U.S. assembly
plant amid much hoopla, but the West German automaker laid on only
a simple farewell as it prepared to close the plant today, when the
last car moved down the line.
   ``People are saying goodbye to each other, people who have
worked together for 10 years,'' said VW spokesman Chet Bahn. ``It's
... a very personal day.''
   Volkswagen cited slumping sales and increased small-car
competition when it announced last fall it would close its U.S.
manufacturing venture, once one of the economic bright spots in
this rust-belt region of western Pennsylvania.
   The plant had been operating below capacity for the past five
years.
   Layoffs of 2,500 blue- and white-collar workers began in March,
when production of the Jetta model, now imported from West Germany,
ended. The last Golf model was scheduled to roll off the 1.5-mile
assembly line today. The Golf now will come from a plant in Mexico.
   About 700 to 800 employees will remain to help mothball the
plant, Bahn said. By mid-September, about 150 employees will be
left, he said.
   The plant was dedicated in 1976 amid rolling dairy farmland
about 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, bringing the promise of
prosperity and lifetime employment to an area already hit hard by
declining manufacturing.
   ``There was so much room for growth,'' said John Burish, 35, of
Penn Hills, who worked in the body shop for 10 years. ``When you
came into this place you knew this is where you were going to
retire.''
   The first car, a white Rabbit, was finished April 10, 1978, but
plans to produce 500,000 cars a year using workers on three shifts
a day never materialized.
   The plant has been making cars for sale in the 1989 model year.
Thousands of Golf and Jetta models are being stockpiled in the
plant's parking lot.
   The modern plant will be the largest single vacant manufacturing
facility in Pennsylvania, with more than 2.8 million square feet
under roof. Most of its production equipment will remain in place.
   Gov. Robert Casey has said finding a new occupant for the plant
is a top priority, but no one has expressed interest so far.
   ``I think most people are hoping somebody else will take it
over,'' said Joel Suter, chairman of the East Huntingdon Township
supervisors. ``I really think that will happen.''
   Meanwhile, many laid-off workers are finding it's hard to match
the $14 to $16 per hour they made on average at the plant.
   Volkswagen has been the largest employer in Westmoreland County,
where the unemployment rate in May was 6.2 percent, compared to 5.6
percent for the nation.
   ``There are a lot of people on the streets looking for a couple
good jobs,'' said Edward Prevenslik, 46, of Ruffsdale, a
maintenance worker at the plant. ``They can go through 50 or 75
before they hire one.''

<HEAD>Study Adds Evidence That Birds Add Brain Cells To Help Learn Songs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As birds learn to sing, their bodies create new
brain cells that indirectly link up to nerves controlling vocal
muscles, scientists reported today.
   ``A major portion of the vocal motor (nerve) pathway is actually
created during song learning,'' researchers wrote in the British
journal Nature.
   Previous studies have found that adult canaries create cells in
a portion of the brain involved in controlling songs. The new work
strengthens the case that such growth in birds plays a role in song
learning, said an editorial accompanying the new report.
   In the study, Kathy and Ernest Nordeen of the University of
Rochester in New York studied brains of male zebra finches. The
birds memorize song between 20 and 65 days after hatching, and
start practicing at about 30 days of age.
   The researchers identified brain cells that arose between ages
of 20 days and 64 days in a part of the brain critical for song
production. More than half the new cells reached into a second area
of the brain that in turn projects to nerve cells that control
vocal muscles, they report.
   Males beyond the learning period and young females, which do not
sing, create far fewer extra brain cells in the critical part of
the brain, researchers said.

<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case
on Wednesday scheduled two closed hearings next month about
classified information that fired White House aide Oliver L. North
wants to use in his defense.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell set arguments on Aug. 8
and Aug. 22 on North's proposed use of classified documents
gathered by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   Gesell also denied a defense motion to reconsider his June 16
ruling that the prosecution's investigation was not tainted by the
improper use of the congressional testimony North and two
co-defendants gave under limited grants of immunity from
prosecution.
   North is charged with conspiring with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to illegally divert
profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Gesell has ordered separate trials for all four defendants and
has scheduled North's to begin Sept. 20.
   North last weekend criticized Gesell's scheduling of his trial
as being politically motivated, according to a published report.
   ``We will go to trial before the election in what is a truly
blatant effort to politicize this activity and create dissension
right at the time of a national election,'' North told a group of
supporters at a fund-raiser in Dallasaccording to excerpts of his
speech provided to the Washington Post.
   Reporters and photographers were barred from the event except
for a photo opportunity with the former national security aide
according to the account in Thursday's edition of the newspaper.
   In the order about classified documents, Gesell said that during
the Aug. 8 hearing he wanted to consider the prosecution's proposal
to substitute portions of classified documents with statements of
facts the material would prove if they were shown directly to the
jury.
   Such a procedure is provided by the Classified Information
Procedures Act, which contains rules for disclosing government
secrets in court.
   The judge said he is ``particularly interested in hearing the
government's explanation of a need to substitute where substitution
is challenged, and will expect defendant to show why the
substitutions proposed will conceal facts required by the defense.''
   Both hearings will be closed to the press and public to protect
the secret documents to be discussed.
   In a related development, former CIA officer Joseph Fernandez,
charged last month with conspiring to illegally set up a secret
arms network to the Contras, challenged the constitutionality of
the classified documents statute as it applied to his case.
   Fernandez, who was scheduled to appear before U.S. District
Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. on Thursday, contends that the law's
requirement that he notify the government of his intention to
disclose government secrets tramples on his right to a fair trial.
   Such disclosure in advance of trial would tip prosecutors to the
defense strategy, Fernandez's lawyers said in court papers.
   The defense noted that Walsh has indicated there are 60,000
classified documents that pertain to the case and there may be
``thousands of additional documents'' that are relevant.
   ``Testimony of virtually every government witness (and the vast
majority of likely defense witnesses) will inevitably contain a
great deal of classified information,'' the defense said.
   ``Even the identity of many of the witnesses in the case _
witnesses for both the government and the defense _ will be
classified,'' Fernandez's lawyers said.

   Heavy rains in the nation's central
and southern sections triggered landslides and floods that have
killed at least six people this week, the National Counter-Disaster
Center reported today.
   Officials said four people died Wednesday when several homes in
valleys in Chunchon were buried under tons of mud and rocks.
Another reportedly was killed in the city, but details were not
available.
   The area east of Seoul was hit by 6.1 inches of rain during a
10-hour period Wednesday.
   Several other people reportedly were injured and about 100 homes
flooded in Chunchon, forcing residents to flee temporarily,
officials said.
   One person died earlier this week in the south.
   Flood and rain damage to homes, crops, highways and bridges has
caused losses the counter-disaster center estimated at $12 million.
   The Central Meteorological Observatory today issued a new
warning of torrential rains in central South Korea as a front moved
through the region toward the southern coast, dumping heavy rains.
   The summer rainy season is expected to last through the end of
next week.

<HEAD>House Chairman Calls for Drought Relief Approval Before August
Break</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers unveiled a wide-ranging drought
relief package for the nation's farmers and quickly began work on
it as a House chairman called for final action by mid-August.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, promised fast action as his panel began reviewing the bill
on Tuesday. He said Congress should send ``a signal that we care''
about the drought ravaging the nation's cropland.
   To speed the bill to passage, de la Garza said, lawmakers should
dispense with the usual parade of witnesses from farm organizations
and other groups.
   Across Capitol Hill, the Senate Agriculture Committee raised the
curtain on a similar bill to provide disaster payments of up to
$100,000 each to farmers whose crops have been wiped out by the
drought.
   The lawmakers acted as the Agriculture Department released a
fresh report forecasting severe damage to the harvest from the
drought.
   It estimated, for example, that U.S. corn output this year would
shrivel to 5.2 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion last year.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told lawmakers it is ``the
largest drought that our nation has ever experienced.''
   ``I think history will show that it's truly more mammoth than
any of us has ever experienced,'' Lyng said. He said a recurrence
next year would ``suggest that we've done something wrong and the
gods are against us.''
   For their part, Agriculture Committee members resolved not to
allow the drought to force a rash of bankruptcies in the
countryside, just as the farm economy is shaking off the stagnation
of the early 1980s.
   ``We're not going to allow their lives as farmers and ranchers
to end because of a freak of nature,'' Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said in remarks on the Senate
floor.
   The legislation unveiled Tuesday is going to be expensive by all
estimates, but there will not any sure way to gauge costs until
August at the earliest. Sponsors express confidence that government
savings resulting from the drought will be enough to offset the
disaster payments.
   The measure would cap disaster payments at $100,000 for each
individual farmer. Payments would represent 65 percent of
pre-drought expected earnings, whether from target prices,
price-support loans or market prices, but they would apply only to
losses in excess of 35 percent of the crop.
   A 50-cent per hundredweight reduction in dairy price supports
scheduled for next year would be canceled under the legislation.
Dairymen say rising feed costs resulting from the drought warrant
such action.
   Feed in government storage that is already being provided on an
emergency basis would be made available to a broader range of
livestock producers up to a maximum benefit of $50,000 for each
individual.
   The drought has burned up a considerable amount of hay and
grazing land and thus feed is now at a premium.
   Under the legislation, wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice
producers would not be required to refund to the government any
deficiency payment they have received in advance.
   Deficiency payments are income supports provided by the
government. They represent the difference between the market value
of a crop and its value at higher target prices set by Congress and
adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture.
   As the drought has spread across rural America, market prices
have climbed steadily, reducing the size of deficiency payments at
the very time that many farmers find themselves without crops to
take to market.
   To complicate matters, many farmers already have received 40
percent of their deficiency payments from the Agriculture
Department and will have to refund a portion of them unless rescued
by relief legislation.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Asked to Pledge Full Meese Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General-designate Richard Thornburgh
should pledge to complete an ethics investigation of Edwin Meese
III, according to members of the Senate panel who will pass
judgment on Thornburgh's nomination.
   Thornburgh ``almost has to guarantee it will be completed,''
said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt. and a member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee. ``I don't think anyone could ask less.''
   Thornburgh, chosen by President Reagan to head the troubled
Justice Department, pledged after his nomination Tuesday to
``follow the evidence wherever it may lead'' on Meese.
   The nominee will likely be asked about the internal probe at his
confirmation hearing.
   Although no date has been set, a staff source at the Judiciary
Committee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``It's
reasonable to assume'' a hearing will be held in early August, with
a full Senate vote by Aug. 12 _ the last scheduled session before
Labor Day.
   Meese will depart as attorney general in a few weeks, already
having pronounced himself ``vindicated'' by an 830-page independent
counsel's report that has not been released by a three-judge court.
   The report has recommended no criminal charges against Meese,
according to sources, but could question his ethics and candor.
   Independent Counsel James McKay's report has been turned over to
Solicitor General Charles Fried, the first step toward a Justice
Department ethics review by Michael E. Shaheen Jr., counsel for the
Office of Professional Responsibility. The internal investigation
would center not on possible criminal acts, but on whether Meese
violated federal conflict-of-interest rules.
   ``The pending investigation ought to go forward,'' said Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``There are ethical questions that go to the
conduct of the office. I think that investigation ought to be
completed.''
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., agreed, ``If the report of the
independent counsel warrants an investigation, I think there should
be one.''
   Other senators were more cautious.
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``Until I'm able to know more
about McKay's report, it would be too early to recommend that the
Office of Professional Responsibility continue or not.''
   The Judiciary panel's ranking Republican, Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina, said: ``A special counsel has investigated this
matter, but we don't know what information he has obtained. I'm
sure Gov. Thornburgh will take that information into consideration
when it is released publicly.''
   Meanwhile, Thornburgh got rave reviews from liberals and
conservatives alike, a consensus the conservative Meese was never
able to build.
   The nominee was praised for his qualifications: two terms as
Pennsylvania governor, a U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, a former
chief of the Justice Department criminal division and, currently,
head of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government.
   Humphrey, a staunch conservative, was the only Judiciary
Committee member to announce opposition, saying Thornburgh did not
support the strong anti-abortion stance of the Republican Party.
   Leahy, a liberal, said, ``I urged competency ahead of ideology''
in selecting a Meese replacement. ``At first blush, it appears that
is what they have done. Had they sent an ideological symbol, it
would have been a battle royal ... for the rest of the year.''
   Now, Leahy said, chances of a ``partisan or ideological battle
are almost nil.''
   Thurmond expressed hope that hearings would ``begin right away''
and added that they can ``if the Democrats don't delay the matter.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the No. 2 Democrat on
the committee, said there won't be a delay.
   ``I have the greatest respect for Dick Thornburgh,'' Kennedy
said. ``The state of justice in America would be very different
today if Dick Thornburgh had been attorney general for the past 3{
years instead of Ed Meese.''
   Meese was investigated by McKay on a number of matters,
including his assistance to Wedtech, a Bronx, N.Y., defense
contractor under investigation for payoffs to win government
contracts; Meese's actions in connection with a proposed $1 billion
Iraqi oil pipeline project; and whether he took actions favorable
to regional Bell telephone companies at a time he held $14,000 in
telephone stock.
   When asked whether he planned to look into the Meese matter,
Thornburgh said, ``I really can't answer any substantive questions
at this time.''
   ``My intention, and this is in any area, is to follow the
evidence wherever it may lead,'' he said. ``And not knowing what
that evidence is, I can't give you a prediction.''

<HEAD>Despite Drought, US Farms Still Outproduce Soviet Union</HEAD>

   Despite one of the worst batterings on record
by drought and heat, U.S. farmers still are going to outproduce the
Soviet Union, which is having one of its best harvest years in
history.
   Overall, total U.S. grain production is now estimated at 212
million metric tons, down 24 percent from 1987.
   The Agriculture Department issued that downward revision
Tuesday. But in a related report, it released figures on total
Soviet grain production that show the United States is still far
ahead.
   USDA said total Soviet grain production this year is forecast at
a bumper yield of 215 million tons. But that figure includes peas,
beans, buckwheat, rice and other miscellaneous commodities in
addition to wheat, barley, sorghum, corn and rye.
   Many of the secondary crops are not included in the U.S. grain
total. Thus, if only soybeans are added _ projected at 44.9 million
metric tons this year _ the drought-shriveled U.S. harvest still
towers over the bumper Soviet yield.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans, or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   The special U.S. crop report showed that the 1988 corn harvest
may produce 5.2 billion bushels this year, 29 percent less than
expected a few months ago and 26 percent below last year's bumper
harvest.
   Until drought and extreme heat tightened their grip in May and
June, USDA had projected this year's corn harvest _ based on yield
trends and an assumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion
bushels, up from last year's output of 7.06 billion.
   Corn is the largest and most important U.S. grain crop and is a
key peg in the nation's agriculture. As a livestock feed it is the
major building block for beef, pork, poultry and dairy products.
Along with wheat, soybeans and other commodities, corn also is
vital as an export, desired by many countries wanting to upgrade
their livestock programs.
   Soybean prospects were shown at 1.65 billion bushels, down from
about 1.9 billion in 1987. Until the drought, the 1988 harvest had
been expected to be around 1.88 billion bushels.
   Projected 1988 output of all wheat was reported at 1.84 billion
bushels, down from 2.1 billion bushels produced last year. In May
and June, before the drought made its impact, USDA had projected a
slightly larger crop than last year.
   The wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall, which
stayed barely ahead of the drought. Later plantings of durum and
other spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness.
   Winter wheat output _ an actual in-field estimate as of July 1,
not a statistical projection _ was estimated at 1.57 billion
bushels, up slightly from 1.56 billion last year and matching the
June estimate.
   Consumer food prices, overall, are going up as a result of the
drought, averaging 3 percent to 5 percent higher this year than
they did in 1987, USDA said. Before the heat and dry weather became
pervasive, USDA estimated the 1988 food price hike at 2 percent to
4 percent.
   Department officials have said 1989 food prices could rise an
additional 2 percent to 3 percent because of this year's crop
losses. That would be on top of an expected rise in 1989 living
costs generally, perhaps around 4 percent.
   Currently, the USDA considers more than 1,900 counties in 37
states as feed-scarce drought areas where emergency assistance is
available.
   Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the USDA's chief economist,
said total U.S. grain production this year is estimated at 212
million metric tons, down 24 percent from 1987.
   ``Total supplies of grain, which take into account existing
stocks (from prior harvests) are estimated at 388 million metric
tons, down 20 percent from a year ago,'' Wilson said.
   Wilson said spring-planted crops are ``entering a critical stage
of development'' and that final levels of 1988 production will
depend on further weather developments.
   Some other crop projections:
   _Cotton, 13.7 million bales this year, compared with 14 million
bales projected in June and 14.76 million bales harvested in 1987.
   _Rice, 159 million hundredweight, up from 157 million projected
in June and the harvest last year of 127.7 million hundredweight.
   _Barley, 291 million bushels, down from 500 million projected in
June and 527 million produced last year.
   _Sorghum, 560 million bushels, down from 650 million indicated
in June and 741 million harvested in 1987.
   The projections released Tuesday were based on an assumption of
normal weather from here on, Wilson said. The estimates will be
updated as the growing season progresses.
   On Aug. 11, the department will issue a full-scale production
report, including the first on-site estimates for corn, soybeans,
spring wheat and other crops.
   Looking at the reduced corn crop, Wilson said that when the
projected 5.2 billion bushels are added to 4.4 billion bushels left
over from previous crops when the new marketing year begins Sept.
1, the total supply for 1988-89 will be 9.6 billion bushels.
   ``This is more than enough to meet the needs of domestic
livestock producers, the food industry and our export customers in
the coming year and leave a four-month supply'' of nearly 2.36
billion bushels on hand on Sept. 1, 1989, he said.
   Large supplies of wheat also will serve as a buffer against
shortages, Wilson said.
   But some other grains, including barley and oats, will be in
much shorter supply. Wilson said oats production could drop to 255
million bushels, well below the pre-drought forecast of 450 million.

<HEAD>Court Throws Out Injunction Blocking Woman's Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge cannot block a woman from having an
abortion her estranged husband wanted to stop, the Indiana Court of
Appeals ruled Tuesday.
   In a 3-0 decision, the court threw out a Shelby Circuit Court
preliminary injunction that prevented Jennifer Ann Conn, 19, of
Morristown from ending her pregnancy.
   Erin Andrew Conn, 23, of Elkhart, had argued that a father's
rights should be weighed against the mother's wishes when
determining if the woman can go ahead with an abortion. Mrs. Conn,
who is approximately eight weeks pregnant, filed for a divorce on
June 17.
   An attorney for the father immediately asked the state Supreme
Court to take an appeal of Tuesday's ruling and to issue a stay of
the Court of Appeals action.
   The state's highest court will likely consider those requests on
Wednesday, court administrator Karl Mulvaney said.
   The appellate panel said acting Judge Robert T. Thopy of the
Shelby County court ignored case law from the U.S. Supreme Court
when he issued an injunction June 27 to prevent the abortion.
   ``We hold that Erin has no right to veto Jennifer's decision to
obtain an abortion as such decision concerns only her,'' Judge
Robert W. Neal wrote for the court.
   The appellate court also ordered the Shelby County court to
dismiss all other proceedings concerning Mrs. Conn's planned
abortion. Thopy had planned to hold another hearing to determine if
Mrs. Conn should be permanently barred from having an abortion.
   The appellate opinion quoted extensively from two U.S. Supreme
Court decisions _ the 1973 Roe vs. Wade case in which state
statutes barring abortions in the first trimester were declared
unconstitutional and the 1976 Planned Parenthood of Central
Missouri vs. Danforth case.
   In the Danforth decision, the high court struck down a law that
required a woman to have spousal approval before getting an
abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
   The appeals judges said Conn's arguments were philosophical and
moral in nature but weren't grounded in case law developed since
the high court rulings.
   Neal was joined in the opinion by Chief Judge Wesley W. Ratliff
Jr. and Judge Jonathan J. Robertson.
   James Bopp Jr., an attorney for Conn and a counsel for the
national Right to Life organization, said the decision is ``ripe
for appeal.'' Bopp, who filed an appeal motion Tuesday afternoon,
said the appellate judges had ignored a father's constitutional
rights.
   ``I'm very disappointed the Indiana Court of Appeals failed to
recognize a father's rights to have his interests weighed,'' Bopp
said.
   Richard A. Waples, an Indiana Civil Liberties Union attorney who
represented Mrs. Conn, said he was ``satisfied that the court
correctly applied the law and said that lower courts can't keep
issuing orders stopping abortions.''

<HEAD>Huey Newton Returns To Prison For Parole Violation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Black Panther Huey Newton
returned to prison Tuesday in connection with a parole violation,
authorities said.
   Lt. Cal White at San Quentin State Prison said Newton was
transferred there from a county jail, but had no details.
   Parole Officer Mike Smith said Monday that Newton had been taken
into custody June 23 at his Oakland home for allegedly violating a
condition of his parole, but he declined to elaborate.
   He said the state Board of Prison Terms offered Newton a deal to
dispose of the parole violation charge, but Newton hadn't indicated
his feelings about the offer.
   A hearing should follow, in which the board would decide the
punishment for the violation, Smith said.
   Newton was acquitted of assault charges filed when he was
arrested for allegedly pistol-whipping a tailor in 1974. The tailor
refused to testify in the case, but Newton was convicted of gun
charges.
   Meanwhile, Newton faces charges in Alameda County Superior Court
for allegedly embezzling state funds from the Oakland Community
School, which was operated by the Panthers.
   He is also scheduled to appear in Alameda Municipal Court in
Oakland July 19 on charges of drunken driving and being a felon
with a firearm.
   Newton served nine months of a 16-month state prison term for
posssessing firearms as an ex-felon and was released on a one-year
parole Dec. 8.

<HEAD>Caribbean Fuels Fight Flares Up as Trade Bill Lands in House Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fight over duty-free ethanol imports from
Caribbean refineries is one of the fights flaring up as the House
readies for yet another round in the battle over trade legislation.
   ``It's a sweetheart arrangement for a few select companies,''
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., declared Tuesday as
he opened fire on the ethanol provision in the 1,000-page trade
bill.
   The bill is set to come to the House floor for a vote today.
   President Reagan vetoed a slightly different version of the bill
on May 24. He cited provisions that would limit Alaska oil exports
and require companies to provide employees with 60-day notice of
plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   Within hours of Reagan's veto, the House voted to pass the
legislation and make it law in spite of his objections. But the
Senate fell short of the two-thirds required for a veto override in
a June 8 vote.
   The Alaska oil and plant-closings provisions have been dropped
from the version of the bill now coming to the floor. Sponsors say
Reagan might be more willing to accept the measure in its modified
form.
   ``I strongly believe Congress owes it to the American people to
do all we can to enact a trade policy,'' House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said.
   Reagan, however, also was critical of the ethanol provision in
his veto message. The plan was conceived as a way to expand
benefits under Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative, but critics say
it goes too far.
   Ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, is used for fuel and can be refined
from a variety of farm products. U.S. corn growers have been irate
over the trade bill's provision to open the door to duty-free
imports.
   Michel said it would not only hurt corn growers but take away
refining jobs in the United States and abuse the Caribbean Basin
Initiative. He said the initiative was designed to boost industries
native to the Caribbean but that five companies currently are using
island refineries to convert European products into ethanol.
   For example, Michel said, Spanish wine has been shipped to the
Caribbean and refined into the alcohol fuel.
   Meanwhile, the plant-closings provision is moving through
Congress as a separate piece of legislation _ or almost separate.
   The House is acting under a format requiring a vote first on the
plant-closings bill, followed quickly by action on the trade
measure. Labor officials were uneasy over splitting off the
plant-closings issue in the first place. They went along with the
idea after Democratic leaders agreed to place it first in line
ahead of trade.
   The plant-closings bill, already passed by the Senate, will go
to the president's desk if as expected it wins House approval.
   Exactly what lies in store for the trade bill remains unclear.
House approval would send it to the Senate, which already has
another version of the measure on its calendar and where numerous
amendments await it.
   Little time remains to sort out the amendments, many highly
controversial, before lawmakers leave Washington for the campaign
trail.
   And there is a question about how much appetite the Senate will
have for the painful nitty-gritty of committee action on trade with
the bill's sponsor, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, increasingly torn
away by his responsibilities as Gov. Michael Dukakis' running mate.
   The central provisions of the bill would overhaul the system
under which the United States imposes import curbs to protect
American industries and retaliates against international trade
violations by other countries.
   The measure also contains a wide array of other provisions
ranging from repeal of the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil
companies to more than $2 billion in agricultural subsidies.

<HEAD>House Passes Plan To Close Military Installations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is likely to propose closing 20
to 25 major military installations if Congress finally approves a
plan to permit the elimination of unneeded bases, a key congressman
says.
   ``That seems to be about the number that have been recommended
in the past,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said as the House voted overwhelming approval
of the complicated plan.
   The 374-39 vote by the House late Tuesday afternoon sends the
plan to a House-Senate conference committee to be reconciled with a
Senate measure approved two months ago.
   While the congressional negotiators are working out the legal
details, a bipartisan nine-member commission appointed by Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is already at work trying to come up
with a list of unneeded bases.
   The commission is headed by former Sen. Abe Ribicoff, D-Conn.,
and former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.
   Carlucci has estimated that between $2 billion and $5 billion a
year could be saved if unneeded bases were closed.
   But Congress, worried about the loss of jobs, has blocked the
Pentagon from closing any major bases since 1977. The commission
plan was developed as a way to take Congress off the hook, and it
is strongly supported by the Reagan administration.
   The commission is supposed to make its recommendations by Dec.
31. President Reagan would then have until Jan. 16, four days
before he leaves office, to accept or reject the entire list. He
could not approve a partial list.
   If Reagan approved the list, the action could be blocked only by
a majority vote of both the House and Senate. The closings would
begin after Jan. 1, 1990.
   The Pentagon has about 3,800 installations in the United States,
but only 355 are major bases that employ more than 300 civilians,
Aspin said. He said the 20 to 25 bases to be closed would come from
among that list of 355.
   Aspin said his figure is ``based on the historical record.'' He
noted that the Pentagon in 1985 had proposed shutting 22 bases.
   After World War II, the Pentagon generally was permitted to do
what it wanted with bases, with the exception of a handful
protected by key members of Congress. The Pentagon closed 3,600
installations between 1961 and 1977.
   But things changed after 1975, when the Air Force proposed
shutting down Loring Air Force Base in northern Maine. That state's
legislators blocked the move by requiring lengthy _ and costly _
environmental impact studies for the Loring closing and all future
closings.
   The chief author of the base-closing plan, Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, said the vote ``will go a long way toward cutting fat
instead of muscle from our national defense.''
   Armey's plan was rejected in 1987 by a 199-192 vote, but he
offered the proposal again because he argued that a lame-duck
administration might be willing to approve the unpopular cuts.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, told his colleagues: ``For too many
years, obsolete military bases have been treated as sacred cows and
the country cannot afford this anymore. ... The time has come for
Congress to stiffen its backbone.''
   House approval came after the chamber, on a voice vote, rejected
a proposed amendment that would have required closing overseas
bases before U.S. bases were shut down. There are about 1,900 U.S.
installations in other nations and the commission will study them,
but will not have authority to recommend that any of them be closed.

<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of Gov. Michael Dukakis'
announcement Tuesday of his choice of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
as his running mate.
   I think Massachusetts likes Lloyd Bentsen. And Massachusetts
likes B.A. (Beryl Ann) Bentsen. And we love you, and doesn't my
bride look fantastic without that collar on.
   It is, as all of you know because you've been here a while,
exceedingly warm. So we're going to keep this brief. Let me begin
by thanking the chairman of our national committee, another son of
Massachusetts that you and I are very, very proud of, for what he
has done over the course of the past four years to create the kind
of winning spirit that will carry Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen to
the White House in January of 1989.
   And I don't have to tell you how I feel, this son of
Massachusetts in this historic place with this city's mayor, with
my colleagues the constitutional officers of this state, with some
great Democratic Party chairs from all over the country. Welcome to
Massachusetts all of you. Welcome to Massachusetts.
   I don't know why, Bonnie Campbell, but I look at you and I think
about Iowa and I think of how far we've come and it's great to have
all of you with us. Paul talked about what happened 28 years ago.
And many of you have heard me say so many times that the parallels
between 1960 and 1988 are very close indeed. Then we had had eight
rather amiable but sleepy years of Republicans in the White House.
We had a country that was ready for change, a son of Massachusetts
_ born in our hometown just a mile from where Kitty and I live _
winning that nomination, reaching out to the state of Texas, asking
a great senator from the state of Texas to join him on the
Democratic ticket. Well, the Republicans in 1960 did what they're
about to do in 1988. They nominated an incumbent Republican vice
president. Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson beat that incumbent
Republican vice president in 1960, and Mike Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen are going to beat them in 1988.
   Selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential act,
if I can use those words, that I will do. And I don't have to tell
you how seriously I took this responsibility. I am very greatful to
some very special people who worked with me, one in particular,
Paul Brountas, who managed this process and who did a superb job.
Little could the Greek troika in the class of 1960 at Harvard Law
School possibly imagine that Dukakis would be the Democratic
nominee for president, Sarbanes would be a Democrat from Maryland
in the United States Senate, and our counselor and adviser and
friend would not only be the chairman of our campaign committee but
the person who managed this wonderful process which has brought us
Lloyd Bentsen. And I'm grateful to all of you and to all who worked
with you.
   Lloyd Bentsen brings to this ticket and will bring to this
nation years of experience, a deep commitment to civil rights and
equality of opportunity that goes way back to the 1940s, and if
there is one commitment that defines him, it is the commitment that
we share together and that is good jobs and economic opportunity
for every single citizen in this country, no matter who they are or
where they come from or what the color of their skin. And this
year, as one of the most respected Democrats and members of the
United States Senate, he has hit a grand slam homerun because as
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee he has personally and
successfully led the fight for welfare reform, for catastrophic
health insurance, for a thoughtful and responsible trade bill and
for a plant closing law that will give American workers at least 60
days notice before they're thrown out on the street. And my
friends, if Edwin Meese can give himself 30 days notice, the least
we can do is give honest hardworking American workers 60 days
notice before we lay them off.
   May I present to you, with respect, with affection, and with
great pride, the next vice president of the United States, Lloyd
Bentsen.

   Here is a transcript of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's
statement Tuesday following Michael Dukakis' selection of Bentsen
as his running mate.
   Well, Mike, I can tell this campaign is already beginning to
heat up.
   Joining this campaign as the vice presidential candidate is not
just an honor, but I think it's a great opportunity to make a
difference for America. The Massachusetts and the Texas axis was
good for the country and good for the Democratic Party in 1960 and
it's going to be a real winner in November of '88.
   Michael Dukakis, the son of immigrant parents, a man whose going
to grow up to be president of the most powerful and prosperous
nation in the world, a man whose living out his parents' dreams,
but once that dream of reality for all Americans, a reality of
jobs, education, health care, these are the things Michael Dukakis
is for. And what I'm impressed with is how he reaches out to the
rest of the country.
   You got a situation in the economy today where it's like a piece
of Swiss cheese with holes in it. Other parts of this economy not
doing as well as the two coasts. But choosing a representative from
that part of the country, once that kind of imput, an inclusive
campaign that reaches out across America, that's what Michael
Dukakis has done and it's going to be a winner.
   Michael Dukakis is a man who didn't turn Massachusetts around
with taxes and spending, but he turned it around with some virtues
that we understand through the Southwest and the South. The virtues
of hard work, the entrepreneurial spirit, integrity and he brought
effective management of the taxpayers' dollar to a new high, and
I'm impressed with that kind of record and so is the country.
   The fact that he's taken a senator from Texas, a senator from
the South, shows that we're going to fight for every state in the
union and we're going all out to win.
   I'm delighted to be back in a state where my great-great-uncle
was a senator from Massachusetts and became vice president of the
United States of America and we're out to duplicate that record
today. Thank you Mike.

<TEXT>
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's moderate record
over 24 years in Congress makes him a relatively tough target for
critics as he sets out to carry the Democratic vice-presidential
standard.
   But on some issues _ including the high-profile matter of U.S.
policy toward Nicaragua _ he is at odds with the man who chose him,
Michael Dukakis.
   Himself a millionaire businessman, Bentsen has consistently
backed favorable tax treatment for businesses _ particularly his
home-state oil industry _ and believes in minimizing government's
regulatory hand on industry.
   He has been hawkish when it comes to supporting weapons
programs, backing the modernization of U.S. nuclear capability by
voting for systems such as the MX missile and B-1 bomber.
   Those conservative stances have been balanced by a strong civil
rights record and by positions in favor of pension reform,
permitting housewives to establish individual retirement accounts
and providing prenatal care for poor pregnant women. He also has
supported the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
   Bentsen also has been behind some of the Democrats' most potent
political issues this year: the trade bill, including a provision
requiring worker notification of impending plant closings, and
protection against costs of catastrophic health care.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen is a centrist Democrat,'' said oil-state
colleague Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La. ``All Democrats supported
his trade bill and supported his tax policies. He builds a
coalition. He's not out on the fringe.''
   He is out of step with his campaign partner, however, on one
matter that leaped into the headlines this week: U.S. relations
with Nicaragua.
   Bentsen, like many other Southern Democrats, has supported the
administration's policy of giving weapons to the Contra rebels to
put military pressure on the leftist Managua government. Dukakis is
a staunch opponent of the policy, calling instead for non-military
solutions to the country's political schism.
   Senate leaders rescheduled a defense money bill which had been
expected to come to the floor this week until after the Democratic
convention, in part because an anticipated Contra military aid
amendment would have highlighted the disagreement between the two
men at a time when the United States and Nicaragua have expelled
each other's top diplomats and plunged relations even further into
the deep freeze.
   Also, Bentsen has favored allowing prayer in public schools,
imposing fees on imported oil and passing a constitutional
amendment to balance the federal budget, and he voted for Reagan's
1981 tax cuts. And he supports the death penalty. Dukakis is on the
opposite side of each of those issues.
   Politically, the mix has helped Bentsen thrive in a state where
Ronald Reagan won big victories in 1980 and 1984 and where
Democratic influence has waned in recent years. His strength has
helped him build a respected statewide organization in Texas and
become Congress' most successful fund-raiser.
   The Federal Election Commission says Bentsen, in the 15 months
ending March 31, raised more than $5 million toward his Senate
re-election bid. Of that amount, $1.46 million was in
special-interest money, more than any other congressional candidate.
   That the Bentsen record and organization lend strength to the
Democratic ticket seemed to be indirectly supported by the comments
of conservative Republicans, who preferred Tuesday to ignore the
Texan and instead aim their barbs at the likely presidential
nominee.
   ``I don't think Republicans are going to be running against
Lloyd Bentsen,'' said GOP Sen. Phil Gramm, another Texan.
``Republicans are going to be running against Michael Dukakis. The
distinctions are just so clear that Bentsen is not an issue.''
   Bentsen has for the most part avoided personal controversy
during his six-year House stint beginning in 1949 and during his
three Senate terms. The most notable recent exception was his
establishment of a $10,000-per-person breakfast club for lobbyists
last year after he took over as chairman of the tax-writing Senate
Finance Committee. He disbanded the effort as soon as it became
public, acknowledging ``a doozy'' of a mistake.
   Despite Dukakis' rejection of presidential runner-up Jesse
Jackson for the No. 2 spot on the ticket, civil rights advocates
were generally positive on Bentsen's record.
   One of his first votes after being elected to the House in 1948
was to oppose the poll tax, considered a courageous move for a
first-term southerner. And Bentsen tells of making a hotel he owned
in Houston the first integrated hotel in the city, said Ralph Neas,
executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   Bentsen is a sponsor of fair housing legislation and voted for
the civil rights restoration bill, an extension of the Voting
Rights Act and for the bill making Martin Luther King's birthday a
holiday, Neas noted.
   It might almost be said that Bentsen takes moderation to an
extreme. In 1986, he was given perfect middle-of-the road voting
ratings of 50 percent by both the liberal AFL-CIO and the American
Conservative Union.
   Last year, according to a voting analysis by Congressional
Quarterly, Bentsen supported President Reagan on 47 percent of
issues on which the White House announced a position, and opposed
the president 50 percent of the time.
   On matters where party unity was a key to the outcome, Bentsen
sided with fellow Democrats 78 percent of the time, a figure
roughly midway between the party's high of 95 percent and the low
of 50 percent.

   Democrat Michael S. Dukakis, who frequently
invokes the legacy of Massachusetts' John F. Kennedy, has again
wrapped himself in the Kennedy mantle by picking a Texas senator as
his running mate.
   ``Many of you have heard me say, so many times, that the
parallels between 1960 and 1988 are very close indeed,'' Dukakis
said on Tuesday while formally announcing his selection of Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen.
   Like Kennedy, Dukakis was born in Brookline, Mass., and he has
spent a lifetime in Democratic politics. And like Kennedy, Dukakis
is competing for the presidency at the end of a two-term Republican
administration.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis added another similarity to the list: like
Kennedy, who picked Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson as his
running mate, Dukakis turned his eyes to Texas when it was time to
fill out the ticket.
   Bentsen, for his part, shares some political roots with Johnson.
Both were proteges of the late House Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas,
products of the moderate wing of the Texas Democratic Party, and
rose to powerful Senate posts.
   In 1960, the Republicans nominated their sitting vice president,
Richard Nixon, and lost a close election. Dukakis said Tuesday that
he hoped history would repeat itself.
   ``Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson beat that incumbent Republican
vice president in 1960, and Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen and
going to beat them in 1988,'' he said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, JFK's only surviving brother, gave his
blessing to Dukakis' choice.
   ``The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving
again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,''
said Kennedy, whose own early decision not to run this year cleared
the way for Dukakis to enter the presidential race.
   Texas Rep. Martin Frost, a 10-year veteran of the House who
knows Bentsen, said even before Bentsen was picked, ``I've thought
there were parallels with 1960.''
   Unlike Bentsen, however, Johnson was actively seeking the
presidency for himself up until Kennedy was nominated. And by some
accounts, Kennedy offered Johnson the No. 2 spot in the belief he
would turn it down.
   Observers with ties to both Massachusetts and Texas were tickled
by Tuesday's turn of events.
   Texas transplant James ``Jim'' Howell, a vice president and
economist at the Bank of Boston, called it ``a great day for the
Republic of Texas.''
   ``I'm absolutely delighted that Gov. Dukakis shows such
remarkable timing and judgment,'' Howell said. He said Bentsen
could help Dukakis in Texas, where Dukakis is not all that well
known.
   ``My relatives have been calling repeatedly and asking who he
is,'' the banker said.
   But there's only so much Bentsen can do for the nominee, Howell
said.
   ``The Baptists will air-condition hell before Lloyd Bentsen can
teach Dukakis to talk Texan,'' he said.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is urging
defense contractors to rein in their private consultants, but says
his job is not to ``punish companies'' in the Pentagon bribery
probe.
   Carlucci appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee on
Tuesday to explain his decision to rescind contract payment
suspensions he had imposed July 1 on nine defense contractors.
   Carlucci said a Navy review showed the contracts hadn't been
tainted, as he had feared when he acted on the basis of FBI
affidavits outlining alleged trading in inside Pentagon contracting
information.
   ``My job is not to punish companies, my job is to protect the
national security,'' Carlucci said, noting that it's up to the
Justice Department to prosecute alleged legal violations.
   But he added, ``if other official information becomes available
during the course of the investigation which warrants new concern
regarding these or other contracts, the department will evaluate it
and take any appropriate action.''
   Carlucci characterized the suspensions as ``a warning'' and said
he is writing the heads of the nation's top 200 defense contractors
to urge them ``to ensure stringent management controls on the use
of consultants to avoid improper business practices.''
   The investigation focuses on allegations that defense
contractors and their consultants bribed Pentagon officials for
inside information that could have been vital in bidding for
contracts worth billions of dollars. No charges have yet been filed.
   Carlucci has appointed a task force to look at the complicated
weapons procurement process and recommend any needed changes. He
urged Congress to let that panel do its job. ``Hasty or piecemeal
reforms ... could do more harm than good,'' he said.
   In addition, ``some of the wrongdoing being uncovered may simply
be violations of the law, not system deficiencies,'' he said.
   But, he admitted, there are problems that need to be fixed.
``There are defects in how America equips its forces.''
   One of those, he noted, is ``what I would term `intervention
points' _ opportunities for friendships or political clout to carry
more weight than contractor performance or product quality and
cost.''
   ``We can reduce these opportunities for intervention through
such techniques as long-term contracts, simplifying specifications,
freezing weapons designs, contracting to performance, and
multi-year approvals of programs,'' he said.
   While Carlucci was promising more reviews of contracts, the
Justice Department is weighing a request from some defense lawyers
to investigate the source of leaks to the press.
   John Russell, a department spokesman, said officials are looking
at the letter sent July 8 to Michael E. Shaheen Jr., head of the
Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
   The letter, signed by 16 attorneys for people and companies in
the defense probe, said, ``We are writing to you to request that
you commence an investigation and take appropriate remedial action
to deal with the virtual flood of leaks by Department of Justice
employees involved in or privy to the details of the
investigation.''
   Russell said it was ``too early to determine that we will
undertake an investigation.'' Shaheen, who has responsibility for
investigating ethics cases involving Justice employees, refused to
comment.
   Investigations into leaks are not unusual, Russell said. ``At
one time, we have anywhere from 10 to 15 leak investigations going
on,'' he said. Some of those include improper revelations of
classified material.
   The letter claims the ``frequency and substance'' of these news
leaks have been unprecedented and are unfair to the people whose
names have surfaced in the investigation.
   The letter outlined seven statutes, regulations or rules that
bar Justice employees from revealing unauthorized material. One law
carries a fine of up to $1,000 and imprisonment of a year for
divulging certain material. Other penalties can include a letter of
censure or dismissal.
   Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., who is
coordinating the massive probe, has also expressed concern about
leaks in the case, which was brought to public attention June 14.
FBI agents conducted surprise searches on more than three dozen
homes and offices in 12 states that day.

   U.S. military helicopters drove off Iranian
gunboats attacking a Panamanian-flagged tanker in the Persian Gulf
in the first such exchange of fire since the downing of Iran Air
flight 655, the Pentagon said.
   The Iranian gunboats were firing at the 81,282-ton Universal
Monarch, which signaled at about 11:30 a.m. EDT Tuesday that it
``was being attacked and was on fire,'' said Defense Department
spokesman Dan Howard.
   A Lamps Mk III surveillance helicopter from the guided-missile
frigate USS Nicholas plus two attack helicopters responded to the
Mayday call, said Lt. Col. David Titus, a spokesman for U.S.
Central Command in Tampa, headquarters for American forces in the
gulf.
   ``As the armed helicopters approached the Universal Monarch, two
small boats were seen departing the area,'' said Titus. ``The boats
fired at the helicopters at approximately 12 noon EDT and the
helicopters returned their fire with rockets and machine gun fire.
   ``It is believed one of the boats was damaged. There was no
damage to the helicopters and no U.S. casualties. The Universal
Monarch suffered some hull, engine and and fire damage. No
casualties were reported and the ship required no further
assistance, acording to its master.''
   Pentagon spokesmen declined to identify the attack helicopters,
but it was believed they were Army AH-6's, flown by Special
Operations Forces attached to the U.S. fleet in the gulf and
operated from specially outfitted barges.
   The incident happened in the northern Persian Gulf, 23 nautical
miles west northwest of Farsi Island, which has been used by Iran's
Revolutionary Guards to launch attacks by small boats against
neutral shipping in the gulf.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said the
Universal Monarch is owned by a Hong Kong company and managed by
the Japanese company Tokudo Shasen K.K., of Tokyo.
   The vessel, flying a Panamanian flag, was sailing empty to pick
up cargo from the Khafji fields, owned jointly by Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, according to shipping executives in the gulf who spoke on
condition they not be identified by name.
   Howard said that, ``to my knowledge, this is the first such
exchange since the incident of (July) the third,'' when the USS
Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iran Air jetliner, killing all
290 people aboard.
   Since the Vincennes incident, Iran has attacked two commercial
vessels _ the Norwegian-owned tanker Berge Strand and the
Romanian-owned freighter Plataresti.
   In the ``tanker war'' that is an offshoot of the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war, Iran attacks neutral shipping in the gulf in
retaliation for Iraqi raids on its oil tankers.
   Last Thursday, Iraqi warplanes raided two supertankers in the
vicinity of Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal at the northeastern
end of the gulf. The Greek-owned 264,108-ton Fellowship L and the
Cypriot 215,780-ton Star Ray were set afire, but no casualties were
reported.
   The Iranian ship attacks have continued despite a broadened role
for U.S. Navy warships in the gulf, enabling them to protect
commercial vessels even if they do not fly the Stars and Stripes.
   In another development, the Pentagon announced the completion of
the 46th U.S. convoy through the gulf, as the USS Robert G. Bradley
finished escorting the reflagged Kuwaiti tanker Townsend to
international waters off Kuwait at about 7:40 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
   The Bradley and the Nicholas are Oliver Hazard Perry-class
guided missile frigates.

   State and local government leaders recommended
tax increases and reforms in entitlement programs to a national
commission studying ways to reduce the federal budget deficit, but
few of the witnesses had specific proposals.
   The witnesses offered their recommendations Tuesday to the
National Economic Commission, which will present its findings to
the new president and Congress in late December.
   New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu, chairman of the National
Governors' Association, called for the ``reform (of) major
non-means tested entitlements'' _ Social Security, Medicare,
veteran's benefits, farm subsidies and federal pensions.
   ``That is obviously the hard political decision,'' he told the
12-member bipartisan panel, which was holding its third public
hearing.
   Democratic Washington attorney Robert Strauss, co-chairman of
the bipartisan commission along with former Reagan administration
Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, unsuccessfully pressed Sununu
for details, saying, ``We're trying to craft a political solution
that's salable.''
   Sununu replied: ``It is one of the luxuries that I have now of
being on this side of the table, with you on that side of the table
charged by Congress to address those tough decisions, that I say,
`We're proud you're there and we hope you make the right choice.'''
   Sununu, a close adviser to Vice President George Bush, did not
talk specifically about tax hikes, but he said ``revenue options''
should be considered only after a spending restriction and other
reforms are enacted.
   He said spending on domestic programs should be allowed to rise
at about half of the rate of inflation, while military spending
should increase at 1 percent to 3 percent above the rate of
inflation.
   In contrast, John H. Stroger Jr., a Cook County, Ill.,
commissioner, called for tax hikes for the richest 10 percent of
individuals and corporations.
   Stroger, who was representing the National Association of
Counties, said various tax cuts passed during the Reagan
administration have had the net effect of reducing tax revenue by
$158 billion next year, probably enough to wipe out the projected
1989 budget deficit.
   ``Those who benefited from tax cuts should now pay their share
towards deficit reduction,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, some
policy-makers want to avoid the hard decision to increase revenues
by looking only at the expenditure side of the budget equation.''
   ``Any comprehensive solution to the deficit problem ... must
look at that terrible `T' word. Call it revenue enhancement, or
whatever, we simply must pay for our needs,'' agreed Trenton, N.J.,
Mayor Arthur J. Holland, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   Calls for more taxes were greeted by skepticism from members of
the commission.
   ``It's going to be extremely difficult for us to accommodate the
needs of various groups like yours when our fundamental job is to
cut spending,'' Lewis, now head of Union Pacific Corp., told
Stroger.
   The witnesses were unanimous in urging the commission to avoid
recommending new federal taxes in areas traditionally reserved for
the states, such as sales taxes.
   ``I urge you to reject proposals for a national sales or
value-added tax,'' said Colorado state Sen. Ted Strickland,
president of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
``States rely heavily upon sales taxes. ... The impact (of a
national sales tax) on state fiscal systems would be severe.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate and House negotiators must square the
differences between the fiscal 1989 transportation appropriations
bills that both chambers have now passed, but their work is already
shadowed by a threatened veto over appropriations for mass transit
and Amtrak.
   The Senate passed its version of the legislation Tuesday, a
$10.6 billion measure that ignores President Reagan's efforts to
rein in federal spending for local mass transit systems and for
Amtrak, the passenger railroad. The vote was 91-6.
   Reagan administration officials, complaining that the bill would
spend $2.3 billion more than the president believes is justified,
say they will urge him to veto the measure.
   The next step is for House and Senate bargainers to reach a
compromise on the measure, which covers the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1. The House passed a $10.8 billion version of the bill on
June 29.
   The Senate bill would allow expenditures of an additional $14.3
billion from taxes that are collected on fuels and other items and
are set aside for aviation, highway and mass transit programs.
   Mass transit programs would receive nearly $3.2 billion under
the legislation, double what Reagan wants. The legislation also
would provide $581 million to Amtrak, the federally subsidized
passenger railroad.
   The bill would bring spending for the Coast Guard to $3 billion,
provide $6.5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, and
set aside $11.6 billion for highway programs.
   As usual, the legislation contains pet projects for the home
states of members of the Appropriations Committee. Among them are
$35 million for work on Route 1 in New Jersey, home state of
Democratic Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg; $16 million for a road project
in Buckhannon and Upshur counties in West Virginia, home of Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd; and $4 million for a bridge in Nashua,
N.H., home of Republican Sen. Warren Rudman.
   The bill would make it harder for a developer to build a
shopping mall and other buildings on a parcel of land in Manassas,
Va., that was part of the battlefield of the Second Battle of Bull
Run, an 1862 Confederate victory. It would forbid the federal
government to approve the construction of highway interchanges in
the area.
   The legislation also would prohibit Boston's Logan airport from
receiving federal assistance unless its system of higher landing
fees for small planes receives a green light from the Department of
Transportation. The case is considered a harbinger for how other
major, congested airports around the nation will handle private
aviation in future years.
   Logan officials raised landing fees for private and commuter
aircraft on July 1, trying to encourage the smaller planes to use
suburban airfields and ease congestion for airline passengers.
   The amendment would require the Transportation Department to
decide by Dec. 5 whether the new charges discriminate against small
aircraft users. If the agency decides against the new fees, federal
aid to Logan will be withheld unless airport officials change their
plan.
   An amendment was included to suspend for one year the penalties
leveled against states whose motorists consistently ignore the 55
mph speed limit.
   If authorities find that more than half the drivers monitored
are driving above 55 mph, a state can lose up to 10 percent of its
federal highway aid. That requirement, however, was not extended to
states that raised their maximum driving speeds to 65 mph under a
federal law passed last year, an omission that has sparked
complaints of unfairness by lawmakers from 55 mph states.
   The amendment, sponsored by Sens. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., was approved on a voice vote. New York
is one of three states _ the others are California and North Dakota
_ whose drivers have been found to have been driving too fast, and
which risk losing some of their federal road assistance.
   Moynihan said the one-year suspension would give Congress a
chance to make the law more consistent.

<HEAD>SEC Challenges Bill On Arbitration of Investors' Disputes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House subcommittee is
accusing the Securities and Exchange Commission of yielding to
pressure from the brokerage industry over a proposal to widen the
choices investors have in disputes with brokers.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, told SEC Chairman
David S. Ruder on Tuesday that his agency ``apparently suffered a
failure of nerve after receiving a firestorm of criticism from
industry lobbyists.''
   Last month, the SEC considered proposing a bill that would have
allowed the agency to ban contracts that bind investors to
arbitration instead of going to court.
   Clauses that require binding arbitration are standard in many
brokerage contracts. They have been under scrutiny since the
October stock market crash, which generated thousands of complaints
by investors claiming they had been treated poorly by brokers.
   The commission decided against submitting such legislation.
Instead, at its July 7 meeting, the SEC voted to ask the exchanges
to study the issue and report by Oct. 15.
   Markey complained to Ruder, who was appearing before the
telecommunications panel, that the brokerage industry has had
numerous contacts with the SEC in recent weeks to complain about
efforts to rein in arbitration.
   ``I'm sure these visitors spoke with one voice, in a chorus of
opposition to any interference with their `right' to impose''
arbitration clauses on investors, Markey said.
   A bill was introduced last week by Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va.,
that would forbid brokers from requiring that their customers agree
to binding arbitration. It also would require that brokers make
investors aware of arbitration clauses in contracts, and alter some
arbitration procedures, such as requiring written decisions.
   Ruder, however, said such legislation seems unnecessary. He said
many brokerage companies have told the SEC in recent weeks that
they have abandoned plans to include the arbitration clauses in
their contracts.
   ``I think where the industry is going has changed,'' Ruder said.
   Ruder told the lawmakers that Congress should hold off action
until Oct. 15, when the nation's stock exchanges have been asked to
offer suggestions on the matter.
   Markey and others pointed out that Congress is scheduled to
adjourn for the year in early October. That would mean if lawmakers
were to withhold legislation until the industry offers its
suggestions, Congress could not act until next year.
   The brokerage industry has argued that arbitration is a quick,
relatively inexpensive way of resolving disputes between investors
and brokers. Critics, however, have argued that investors often
don't realize they are agreeing to limit themselves to arbitration,
and should not be denied an opportunity to go to court.

   A power outage affecting thousands of Staten
Island customers Tuesday caused a treatment plant to spew 2 million
gallons of sewage an hour into New York Harbor and gave the city a
new reason to close beaches.
   The outage began Monday and continued until 4:30 p.m. Tuesday,
except for a two-hour respite Tuesday morning, authorities said.
   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern Tuesday announced the closing of
Coney Island, Brighton and Manhattan beaches in Brooklyn, and
South, Wolfe's Pond Park and Midland beaches on Staten Island.
   Midland Beach already was closed because of the discovery of
blood samples and other medical-type debris beginning last
Wednesday there and on Long Island beaches, where beaches had
reopened by Tuesday.
   ``Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water,
misfortune strikes again,'' said Stern.
   ``Once power is restored, it will be very quick to open on
Control Plant between Staten Island and Bayonne, N.J., said Tina
Casey, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection.
   In another beach pollution development, state Health
Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod said Tuesday in Albany that a vial
that washed ashore last week on Long Island contained blood from a
person exposed to the AIDS virus.
   Tests showed that the seal on the vial, and on two other glass
vials containing human blood that were found on Long Island beaches
last week, hadn't leaked and allowed tainted blood to escape,
Axelrod said.
   While the results ``confirm some of our fears'' about the
dangers of the medical debris that washed up on the shoreline last
week and temporarily closed some beaches, Axelrod said ``we do not
feel the presence of these materials represents a significant
public health hazard.''
   ``While there is always the remote possibility of transmission
of the virus by someone's stepping on a tube of blood, breaking the
containers, sustaining a cut and in effect, injecting himself with
the blood containing a sufficient dose of the live virus, we do not
believe that this is a significant likelihood,'' Axelrod said.

   Sen. John Kerry used the Heimlich maneuver for
the first time ever when he saved a colleague from choking, an aide
to Kerry said.
   ``He just seemed to act very instinctively,'' Kerry aide Larry
Carpman said Tuesday, describing how the Massachusetts Democrat
came to the aid of Sen. Chic Hecht, a conservative Republican from
Nevada.
   Kerry was getting off a second floor elevator in the Capitol
around lunchtime when he saw Hecht buckled over in the corridor,
said Carpman, who was there.
   ``The first thing he did was ask Hecht, `Are you okay?''' the
aide said. But when there was no answer, Kerry realized Hecht was
choking and couldn't breathe, Carpman said.
   ``He knew that it was not an ordinary kind of clearing of one's
throat. Senator Hecht was motioning that he couldn't breathe,''
Carpman said.
   Kerry then began administering the Heimlich maneuver, which
dislodged food from Hecht's windpipe.
   Hecht, who was leaving the Senate Republicans' weekly luncheon
meeting when the incident happened, later sent Kerry a personal
note of thanks, Carpman said.

   The attack aboard a Greek cruise ship was
one of the bloodiest terrorist actions involving Greece in the past
three years. Following are some of the major acts of terrorism
since 1985.
   _June 28, 1988: Capt. William E. Nordeen, a U.S. defense
attache, killed in a car-bomb blast in an Athens suburb. A
left-wing terrorist group, calling itself November 17, claimed
responsibility. November 17 terrorists have been blamed for 12
political assassinations in 13 years, including the deaths of three
Americans. None of its members has been arrested.
   _Aug. 10, 1987: A car bomb exploded next to a busload of
American servicemen in a seaside suburb of Athens, wounding 11
people. November 17 said it was responsible.
   _April 24, 1987: A bomb exploded in front of a van carrying U.S.
servicemen in Athens and 18 were wounded. November 17 said its
members made the attack.
   _April 2, 1986: An explosion ripped a hole in the fuselage of a
Trans World Airlines jetliner flying over southern Greece. Four
Americans, including a mother, her daughter and infant
grandaughter, perished in the blast.
   _Nov. 24, 1985: A Cairo-bound Egyptair passenger jet was
hijacked shortly after leaving Athens. It was diverted to Malta,
where 60 people were killed when Egyptian commandos assaulted the
plane.
   _June 14, 1985: A TWA jet flying from Athens to Rome is hijacked
soon after takeoff. One American, a U.S. Navy diver, was killed and
38 people were held hostage 17 days before being released in
Beirut, Lebanon.

<HEAD>US Hoping for Information from Iran to Fill in Blanks on Airliner
Puzzle</HEAD>

   Iran's attempts this week to elicit
international condemnation of the downing of Iran Air flight 655
could also give U.S. officials a chance to demand answers to
several puzzles that only Iran can provide.
   Iran is taking the U.S. downing of its airliner onto the
international stage beginning today, in hopes of bringing worldwide
pressure to bear on the United States to withdraw its naval forces
from the Persian Gulf.
   But in going before the International Civil Aviation
Organization today and the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, Iran
may also give the United States a chance to demand answers from
Tehran on several key questions.
   Chief among them are whether the airliner was indeed
broadcasting some of its identification signals on a military
channel, and if so, why.
   Meanwhile, in the Persian Gulf, Rear Adm. William Fogarty is
heading the U.S. investigation to determine why the sophisticated
radar and tracking system aboard the Vincennes mistook the A300
Airbus for an F-14 fighter, and to determine how the ship's
skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers III, reached his decision to fire.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, testifying before the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday the investigation
will take ``at least another two weeks'' to complete. Fogarty
originally was given 15 days after the July 3 incident to finish
his report, with an option to extend.
   Here are some of the questions the U.S. investigators will
address, and the answers _ in many cases only partial _ that have
been suggested so far:
   Q: Why did Vincennes believe the Airbus was an F-14?
   A: Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard has said the most compelling
reason was that the Airbus was broadcasting two identification
signals, one using a frequency and a code used by both civilian and
military aircraft, the other using a frequency used only by
military aircraft and a code associated with Iranian F-14's.
Investigators are looking for further confirmation of the two
signals. If the signals were sent, Iran has not explained why.
   Q: Did the Vincennes' officers realize a commercial aircraft was
due in the area?
   A: Officers in the wardroom of the Vincennes thumbed frantically
through a commercial schedule, but did not see flight 655, from
Bandar Abbas to Dubai. Howard said that the plane was 27 minutes
off schedule and four-and-a-half miles off the center of a
commercial air corridor. Iran says it recognizes an air corridor 20
miles wide, and that in any case, the plane was within the
nine-mile-wide corridor recognized by other nations.
   Q: Do F-14's pose a special threat?
   A: U.S. commanders in the gulf were on heightened alert over
that weekend, in part because they had received intelligence
reports from ``multiple sources'' that ``you can expect a Fourth of
July surprise,'' according to an official familiar with the
incident.
   Additionally, Iran recently moved several of its estimated 15
F-14 fighters to Bandar Abbas. The F-14, the most sophisticated
Iranian plane, has been used sparingly in combat, although one did
shoot down an Iraqi F-1 last February. For the most part, Iran uses
the sophisticated radar system aboard the F-14 to spot possible
Iraqi air attacks against tankers carrying Iranian oil through the
gulf, according to Pentagon and congressional sources.
   Q: Iranian officials say that flight 655 had been in radio
contact with air traffic control, although it is not clear whether
this was before or after it took off. Did American forces overhear
such communications?
   A: The investigation will reveal whether U.S. listening posts
monitored such radio broadcasts, say Pentagon spokesmen. But the
Vincennes did not hear the broadcasts, Howard said. Such broadcasts
are made on VHF wavelengths which are best received within sight of
the transmitter, said one Pentagon expert. If a U.S. surveillance
aircraft had been aloft, it might have overheard transmissions from
the Iran flight while it was on the ground.

Candidate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After one last late-night meeting, the decision
was made. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee-apparent, would ask Lloyd Bentsen to be his running mate.
   The call was put through. And the call went unanswered.
   Bentsen, the Texas senator, had gotten tired of fielding
midnight calls from reporters about the vice presidential selection
process. So he unplugged his phone and went to sleep.
   He got word of Dukakis' offer the next day at 6:30 a.m. He was
shaving. He said yes.
   It marked the end of a five-week search that began the day after
a long, grueling primary season.
   Dukakis, anxious to avoid appearing arrogant, refused to talk
about the topic of running mates while the race for the nomination
was still on.
   On the night of June 7, in the final four primaries, Dukakis
clinched the delegates he needed. On the morning of June 8, at
breakfast, campaign chairman Paul Brountas presented Dukakis with a
long memo, outlining qualifications for the No. 2 spot.
   Then Brountas, a college classmate and longtime confidant of
Dukakis, began painstakingly gathering information on prospective
running mates.
   He said he gained the confidence of the 200 or so people he
consulted by describing himself as ``a committee of one'' who would
pass information only to Dukakis.
   The Boston lawyer assembled a team of lawyers and tax
accountants to investigate the finalists. None of them, he said,
were eliminated from consideration as a result of the background
checks. But he refused to say why Bentsen won out.
   In a recent interview, Bentsen had insisted he wasn't
interested, saying fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson _ Kennedy's pick in
1960 _ had repeatedly complained about the job.
   Brountas knew otherwise.
   He had met with Bentsen in mid-June, and the Senate Finance
Committee chairman ``indicated to me he would accept if asked,''
Brountas recalled Tuesday.
   The process, of course, was meant to be secret. Dukakis' team,
sequestered on the fifth floor of his campaign headquarters,
jokingly called their task the ``Manhattan Project.''
   But the search took place, to a large extent, in the public eye.
   Reporters tracked Brountas as he made his rounds. They trailed
Dukakis when he came to Capitol Hill to talk with prospective
running mates. They staked out the Statehouse when potential
candidates came to Boston.
   In due course, the names emerged.
   Ohio Sen. John Glenn, the astronaut and hero, was the early
favorite. His chances were hurt as the Brountas team reviewed his
unorganized 1984 presidential campaign. Nevertheless, he remained
the leading choice among many Democrats as they began to prepare
for next week's convention.
   Another leading choice was Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, whose foreign
policy and defense expertise, conservative views and Southern base
were seen as three attributes certain to help a Dukakis-led ticket.
First there were reports Nunn would also want to serve as defense
secretary; ultimately he told Dukakis he wasn't interested.
   There were two candidates who had developed quick rapports with
Dukakis: New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and Indiana Rep. Lee
Hamilton. Bradley bowed out and Hamilton, a virtual unknown from a
predominantly Republican state, would have been a risky choice.
   Florida Sen. Bob Graham offered the Democrats a chance in
Florida but the former governor, in his first Senate term, lacked
the Washington experience Dukakis was looking for.
   Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri both had strengths, but had criticized Dukakis when they
were still in the presidential race. They also placed behind Jesse
Jackson, and picking one of them could have offended Jackson's
supporters.
   Every major poll showed Jackson would hurt the ticket. Despite
Dukakis' statement that the civil rights leader was getting ``very
serious consideration'' right up to the decision was made,
Jackson's flamboyance and lack of government experience all but
ruled him out from the outset.
   So it came down to Bentsen, in that final meeting Monday night
in Dukakis' Brookline home.
   While he waited for Brountas to arrive, Dukakis mowed the lawn.
After the meeting ended, he took out the trash.
   With the kitchen clock approaching midnight, Dukakis looked
around the table. With him were his wife Kitty; Brountas, campaign
manager Susan Estrich and deputy Jack Corrigan.
   Bentsen was the choice of all four. Dukakis made it unanimous.
   ``That's my choice,'' he said.
   Like his close friend Dukakis, Brountas is serious, determined,
disciplined, little inclined to show his feelings.
   But as he drove away from Dukakis' home that night, his weighty
task completed, Brountas was smiling broadly.

   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who has
lived in seclusion for five years, made a rare public appearance to
greet U.S. oil magnate Armand Hammer.
   A smiling Begin, wearing a white short-sleeved shirt, faced
television cameras and embraced Hammer, the chairman of Occidental
Petroleum who is being feted by Israeli leaders in honor of his
90th birthday.
   ``He looks great, is in good spirits,'' Hammer said of the
74-year-old Begin after a half-hour meeting on Tuesday.
   Israel television quoted Hammer as saying he would donate $1
million toward a hospital wing in the name of Begin's late wife,
Aliza.
   Begin, who was elected prime minister in 1977, resigned suddenly
and without explanation in 1983 and went into seclusion, refusing
at one point to greet Jimmy Carter during a visit to Israel by the
former president.
   Since then, only his family and a few close friends have seen
him. Begin has appeared in public only to attend annual memorial
services at his wife's grave.

   Sonny Bono, the entertainer and mayor of Palm
Springs, Calif., told Edward Koch that he'd like to be as much of a
``hip-shooter'' as the fast-quipping New York City mayor.
   ``My platform was to go to an entrepreneurial type of government
as opposed to a real bureaucratic set up, sort of a hip-shooter,
like you,'' Bono said Tuesday during a courtesy call on Koch at
City Hall. ``I hear you're a big hip-shooter.''
   The flamboyant Koch responded tongue-in-cheek, ``How can they
say that?''
   Bono, who was elected in April, was in town with his wife, Mary,
and 2-month-old son Chesare.
   ``I wanted to meet the biggest hip-shooter in the country,''
Bono said.
   Koch asked, ``Don't you find that you're happier ... when you're
telling people exactly what you think?''
   Koch also asked the songwriter whether he had consulted with
another entertainer-turned-politician, Clint Eastwood, mayor of
Carmel by the Sea in California.
   ``I called him,'' Bono said, ``and he said have a lot of coffees
and meet people.''

of the Prudential Insurance Co., according to the insurance firm.
   Volcker, 60, joins the company's 24-member board for a four-year
term, said Prudential spokesman Joe Vecchione on Tuesday.
   Volcker was appointed chairman of the Fed's Board of Governors
by President Carter in August 1979 and was named to a second
four-year term by President Reagan in August 1983.
   He stepped down in August 1987 to become chairman of James D.
Wolfensohn, Inc., an investment banking firm in New York City.
   Volcker, who teaches international economic policy at Princeton
University, also serves on the boards of Nestle SA of Switzerland,
Imperial Chemical Industries of London, and Municipal Investors

   There's keen interest in the long-awaited
solo debut of Beach Boy Brian Wilson, and industry watchers say his
new album may become one of the summer's biggest hits.
   The album shows that Wilson's creative genius has survived the
torment of an often bizarre private life that sent him into
seclusion 20 years ago, reviewers say.
   ``There's heavy-duty interest,'' said Howard Krumholz, buyer for
Tower Records' Sunset Boulevard store. ``I expect it to be real
strong. It's our No. 1 requested new release. All the reviews are
good.''
   The 46-year-old composer-singer's Sire-Reprise Records album,
``Brian Wilson,'' went on sale Tuesday.
   Led by Wilson, the Beach Boys emerged in the early 1960s with a
string of hits glamorizing Southern California sun, surf, teen-love
and hot rods, including ``California Girls,'' ``Surfin' Safari''
and ``Good Vibrations.''

   Here is a thumbnail sketch of Dick Thornburgh,
nominated by President Reagan to succeed Edwin Meese III as
attorney general:
   AGE: 55
   FAMILY: The son of an engineer and grandson of a university
professor, Thornburgh is married to the former Virginia Judson, a
schoolteacher. His first wife, also named Virginia, was killed in
an automobile accident in 1960 that left the youngest of his three
sons brain damaged. Thornburgh now has a fourth son by his second
wife, whom he married in 1963.
   EDUCATION: He earned a civil engineering degree from Yale
University in 1954. He returned to his native Pittsburgh and earned
a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh Law School in 1957.
   JOB HISTORY: He was appointed U.S. attorney for western
Pennsylvania in 1969. As a prosecutor, his targets included a U.S.
customs agent, a county sheriff and a former GOP congressman, J.
Irving Whalley, who was convicted in a kickback case. In 1975, he
was appointed by President Ford to be assistant attorney general in
charge of the Justice Department's criminal division.
   In 1978, the Republican Thornburgh defeated former Pittsburgh
Mayor Pete Flaherty for governor. He ran on a platform of cleaning
up corruption in the Democratic administration of then-Gov. Milton
Shapp, a Democrat. He was re-elected in 1982, narrowly defeating
former congressman Allen Ertel during a recession that made it
difficult for incumbent GOP candidates.
   Barred by law from seeking a third term, Thornburgh left
Pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the Institute of Politics
at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
   POSITIONS AS GOVERNOR: Thornburgh's budget proposals held
spending increases to less than the rate of inflation for eight
straight years. He championed a controversial welfare reform law
that limited cash benefits to three months a year for an estimated
68,000 people considered ``able-bodied.''
   A sampling of his positions:
   _On abortion, Thornburgh has a mixed record. In December 1981,
he vetoed an Abortion Control Act, saying he objected to sections
that said life started at conception, that mandated a 24-hour
waiting period, and that would have established criminal penalties
for doctors who broke the law.
   On June 11, 1982, however, Thornburgh signed a watered-down
version of the abortion bill, which required doctors to notify
women about the risks of abortion and the availability of medical
assistance for prenatal care and childbirth. Portions of the law
were later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   _On capital punishment, Thornburgh said during both terms in
office that he favored the death penalty for certain murders and
for persons convicted of killing police officers and prison guards.
During his first term, the death penalty was reinstated in
Pennsylvania. During his second term, Thornburgh signed warrants
setting execution dates for several convicted murderers. Appeals
courts granted stays in each case.
   _On gun control, Thornburgh said while campaigning for his first
term that he opposed further government regulation of the sale or
purchase of firearms. Subsequent public statements on this issue
could not be found. While governor, Thornburgh signed a bill
setting a mandatory five-year sentence for any person convicted of
using a gun during a crime.
   _On drugs, Thornburgh expanded funding and staffing for the
state police and created special units to investigate drug
trafficking and organized crime. He also supported efforts to
provide tougher prison sentences for some drug-related crimes.

   Iran denied involvement in the terrorist
attack on a Greek cruise ship and said the CIA may have carried it
out to ``whitewash'' the U.S. attack on an Iranian airliner last
week.
   The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday in a statement
broadcast by Tehran Radio that the United States ``is confronted
with a major difficulty in the face of world public opinion and
political and international circles'' after its Navy shot down the
Iran Air A300 Airbus on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard.
   ``In view of the nature of imperialism and its inhuman attitude,
it can be predicted that the American espionage network, the CIA,
and its agents may commit such unpleasant incidents in various
parts of the world in order to whitewash the disaster of the attack
on the Iranian passenger airliner,'' the statement said.
   Up to 11 people were killed and 98 wounded when terrorists
opened fire with automatic weapons and hurled grenades aboard the
Greek cruise ship City of Poros on Monday.
   Greek authorities speculated Tuesday that pro-Iranian Arab
terrorists may be responsible.
   Iran's ambassador to Greece, Habibullah Biazar, said the
speculation was ``a pack of lies.'' He spoke in an interview in
Athens with Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted him as saying: ``We
categorically condemn such acts of terrorism against innocent
people which damage the interests of a friendly and peace-loving
country like Greece.''
   He denied police reports that an Iranian magazine was found
around the wreckage of a car that exploded Monday six hours before
the ship attack. Two people were killed in the blast near the City
of Poros' dock.
   Biazar said the magazine was Arabic. Iranians speak Farsi.

   Communist guerrillas used rockets,
grenades and automatic weapons in a surprise attack on an army base
that killed 17 soldiers and wounded eight, the army said.
   It said fighters from the National Liberation Army, a pro-Castro
group, and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a pro-Soviet
group, attacked the base in Puerto Lopex, 210 miles north of
Bogota, early Tuesday.
   Military sources said they presume the guerrilla suffered some
casualties, but no figure was available.
   Army helicopters helped the soldiers pursue the rebels.
   It was the largest guerrilla attack on the Colombian army since
June 16, 1987, when a Revolutionary Armed Forces group killed 25
soldiers in Caqueta province in the Amazonian jungle south of the
capital.

   They have been called unsung heroes, the legions
of nurses who have devoted their working lives to the AIDS
epidemic. On Thursday, the federal government honors 14, a way to
celebrate the dedication and compassion of them all. Associated

them in side-by-side stories: Terry Miles, who helped change the

   Terry Miles entered the eye of the epidemic
three years ago to find an AIDS ward where he could nurse patients
his way, with healthy doses of compassion, care and dignity.
   ``I found there was no such thing in New York,'' Miles said,
recalling those days of disillusionment. ``And most of the time, I
was treated curtly, and I was a registered nurse looking for a job!
   ``So if I was being treated that way, then how were the people
needing the care being treated?''
   He already knew the answer. He had seen it in the Florida
hospital where he'd worked: food trays left outside rooms by nurses
and orderlies too frightened to venture in; health care workers
donning mask, gown and gloves just to peek at an AIDS patient
through a half-opened door. Four years into the epidemic, people
were still being abandoned, starved for human contact because of
fear and ignorance.
   ``It was an agonizing ache within me to do something about
that,'' the 32-year-old Miles said. He was preparing to leave New
York when a call came from Kathleen McGuirk, a former colleague who
had become nursing director at St. Clare's, a small, aging Roman
Catholic hospital tucked into Manhattan's tough Hell's Kitchen
neighborhood.
   She was planning to open an AIDS ward there, the city's first.
   ``I came to New York willing and assuming I would be a small
participant,'' Miles said. ``I didn't come here with any notion to
be a person to create the health-care system for people with HIV
infections.''
   He did it anyway. Less than six months after he arrived, Miles
was running St. Clare's new Spellman Services Center, a model for
other hospitals.
   On Thursday, he and 13 other nurses who care for AIDS patients
will receive awards in Washington from the federal government. Dr.
Robert E. Windom, assistant health and human services secretary,
called nurses the ``unsung heroes'' of the AIDS epidemic.
   ``Looking back on it, I don't think any of us really knew what
we were doing, in the sense of how much work it was going to be,
how involved we were going to become, how almost three years later,
we're still growing and changing and looking like we're never going
to finish,'' said Miles, now the hospital's assistant nursing
director. ``But this little hospital that could, did _ by doing,
not by talking the issue to death.''
   What Miles began as one 15-bed unit has grown to five units with
60 beds, with 25 more by the end of July. The out-patient program
sees 250 people a week for a variety of services, including
treatment, education and counseling.
   Spellman runs a secured unit for state prisoners with AIDS, and
a new neuro-psychiatric unit is in the works for people too sick to
be out-patients but too well to be in acute care.
   Getting this far has been a struggle. From the beginning, many
inside St. Clare's were hostile and resistant. Miles, McGuirk and a
few other nurses did it alone.
   ``There were times, literally for days, when (we didn't) walk
out of this hospital,'' said Miles, whose robust blond, blue-eyed
good looks bespeak indefatigable energy. ``We would take turns
sleeping on the table in the staff education room. Because we had
to be here.''
   Ellen Altmann, a nurse who came to Spellman three weeks after it
opened in 1985 and now is its clinical coordinator, said Miles held
the project together.
   ``When there were problems on the Spellman unit _ and we had
many, many problems of people being frightened _ the only thing
that calmed the staff down was being able to talk to Terry,'' she
said. ``He never got annoyed or distraught. And he really did take
a lot of abuse in the beginning. We all did. He remained like a
rock.''
   The boy who grew up in small-town Kentucky, the youngest of six
children, came to nursing 13 years ago looking for security.
English majors were waiting tables; nursing students were getting
jobs.
   He discovered that nursing fulfilled his need to be needed and
nurtured his special gift, an ability to educate people, to break
down barriers. The AIDS epidemic has brought Miles into his own: he
spends 70 percent of his time teaching, dispelling ignorance about
the virus around the country with almost evangelical zeal.
   One of the best lessons he has taught his staff, Altmann said,
is the importance of touch _ the gesture, the hug that can heal as
powerfully as any medicine.
   ``Working with people with AIDS, more than anything else, makes
you realize you're working with individuals, not with diseases, not
with illnesses, but with individuals,'' Miles said. ``We're here to
care about people. And wherever that caring takes us is where we
willingly go.''

   Morphine snaked slowly, silently down the tube
and into the boy's vein. His dark eyes were round and open wide,
too big for his wasting body. The light was low. Fear filled the
room.
   ``I hurt all the time now, Dottie,'' he said.
   The nurse tightened her grip on the boy's hand, almost
imperceptibly. She didn't speak for a while.
   ``Do you get scared?''
   She asked it serenely, quietly, matter-of-factly.
   The boy nodded slightly, a little ashamed.
   ``A lot of kids get scared,'' she said. ``It's a really scary
time.''
   There was more silence. She kneaded his hand for a long time.
   ``I'm gonna go now,'' she said, finally.
   ``Why?''
   ``I have to see some other kids.''
   ``No.''
   ``I'll come back.''
   ``When?''
   ``After lunch. Is that OK?''
   ``No.''
   She didn't go just yet, waiting until he was more ready.
   ``Don't you want to see my ear?'' he asked, stalling. ``The scab
fell off.''
   The nurse lifted the gauze.
   ``Oh, that's great. It's looking much better.''
   The boy looked pleased. He was ready now. As ready as he could
be. She left.

   In the hallway outside, Dorothy Ward-Wimmer explained that the
6-year-old boy ``won't get to leave the hospital unless he gets to
go to an extended care facility.''
   What she means is that he will die. Perhaps not soon, but too
soon. He will not go home again.
   The medical team making the rounds of AIDS patients on this day
at Children's Hospital had conferred for 10 minutes outside the
boy's room about how to help the youngster cope with pain. That's
all they were left with.
   There was talk of finding another place for him, a hospice.
   Maria Simmons, the boy's primary care nurse in the floor's
intensive care unit, is having difficulty with the prospect. Her
eyes moisten. There is discomfort in the air.
   ``I'm sorry we have to take your patients away after they become
your friends,'' Dr. Shelby Joseph tells the young woman.
   The boy's mother, sick with AIDS herself and pregnant again,
lies sleeping on a cot in her son's room. She does not wake when
the doctors and nurses come in.
   Later, Ward-Wimmer is asked whether the young boy is afraid of
dying.
   ``No, he's afraid of being left alone in the room,'' she said.

   Ward-Wimmer, a nurse since 1962, has been in charge of AIDS care
at Children's Hospital for two years. On Thursday, she will be
among 14 nurses from around the country honored here by the
Department of Health and Human Services for their selfless service
to AIDS victims.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   When she is with one of her young patients, Ward-Wimmer is very
still. Otherwise, she's usually in motion and something of a
spectacle. A New York Giants football doll dangles from a chain
clipped to her smock. There's a fat blue heart the size of a dime
on one lapel and a button that says ``I care for children and
families.'' Underneath she wears a blue T-shirt, one of six from
her hug motif collection. On this day the message is ``I Give Great
Hugs.'' Her short gray hair touches a yellow bandanna around her
neck.
   Everyone in the hospital seems to know her and she seems to know
everyone in the hospital. They all call her Dottie.
   Over her desk in a cramped and cluttered office she shares with
Joseph are rows of photos of children she has cared for, including
her own three, now grown.
   And there's this sign, a gift from a friend: ``One Day I Shall
Burst My Bud Of Calm And Blossom Into Hysteria.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Later, there's a little time for a second cup of coffee.
   She's asked about the sleeping mother upstairs in the dying
boy's room. She admits feeling anger when the woman became pregnant.
   ``I thought, `How could she do this to me?' I hate taking care
of these babies. I don't want to take care of these babies anymore.
I want to take care of babies, but not AIDS babies. I want it to go
away. I want AIDS to go away.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Before coming to Washington, Ward-Wimmer ran a hospice in
Neptune, N.J. She recalls the 4-year-old cancer victim there who
taught her about dealing with dying children.
   ``I told him, `It'll be all right.' `No, it won't, Dottie,' he
said.
   ``That is how you learn. From children.''
   But experience and learning don't make it any easier to accept a
child's death, she said.
   ``We cry,'' she said. ``The doctors and the nurses and the moms.
We cry real tears. It hurts.''

<TEXT>
   Upstairs, Ward-Wimmer has taped the dying boy's kindergarten
report card to the door to his room, along with some of his art
work _ brightly colored cards to his mother and to the woman he
calls Dottie.
   ``Although many skills and activities have been difficult for
Michael, he has attempted everything with enthusiasm,'' the boy's
teacher has written.
   The next entry is ``Days absent, 132. Days present, 49.''
   And finally: ``Your child has been assigned to grade 1 for the
coming year.''

   Linda Ronstadt's ``Canciones de mi Padre'' has
brought songs of her father, Gilbert Ronstadt, and his father, who
lived in Sonora, Mexico, to Broadway's Minskoff Theater.
   It's an impressive evening, with changes of scenery, lighting
and costumes and usually a dozen musicians on stage, the Mariachi
Vargas de Tecalitlan, for 18 performances, from Tuesday, opening
night, through July 30.
   She sings with the moon, by a fountain and enters once on the
cowcatcher of a giant locomotive. She wears braids, red poppies in
her hair, embroidered bolero suits and, in a section of
revolutionary songs, crossed bandoleers.
   There are three dance couples, choreographed by Michael Smuin,
whose Broadway credits include the much different ``Duke
Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies.''
   Miss Ronstadt is no dilettante with these Mexican songs. She
makes her voice break as she seems to pour forth her entire
emotional arsenal through the words and music.
   But she remains musical, conveying urgency without being quite
strident. Her vocal tone even remains pretty through the near-growl
of anguish. In the soft songs, the sweetness of her voice is heard.
   Mexican songs, happy, sad or dancehall fast, are generally very
emotional. Miss Ronstadt has the style admirably and the audience
gets both strong delivery and an entirely musical experience.
   She sings duets and at times the mariachi band sings backup. The
dancers are spotlighted from time to time through the evening,
wearing costumes of different regions. The women go from fluffy
white to full, bordered skirts that look like ribbon candy when
swirled high.
   Ira Koslow produced. Smuin directed. Tony Walton designed sets
and Jules Fisher did lighting.
   Miss Ronstadt became famous as a fine rock singer, went on the
legitimate stage in New York, recorded standards from the 1930s and
'40s. Her latest effort lives up to its billing as a ``Romantic
Evening in Old Mexico.''

<HEAD>Bush Would Like to Forget Last Race Against Bentsen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For George Bush, the selection of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas _ the man who beat him in a 1970 Senate race _ for
the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket must bring back haunting
memories.
   But the choice, which caught Bush supporters by surprise, could
give the vice president new latitude in selecting his own running
mate.
   It was against Bentsen that Bush lost his last solo general
election race.
   But if Democrats think that naming Bentsen, with his proven
record of beating Bush on ``home'' turf, will bedevil the certain
Republican nominee and hand over Texas and the South, they may have
miscalculated, according to Bush backers.
   ``People in Texas want a president, not a vice president,'' said
Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater.
   Atwater claims Bentsen's selection may give Dukakis an immediate
surge in the polls in Texas, ``but that will settle down and after
all is said and done, George Bush is going to win Texas.'
   Still, the name of the game is electoral votes, and Texas has 29
of them _ a bonanza that could help put the Democrats over the top
if their strategy succeeds.
   The fight for Texas could bolster arguments for the GOP to add a
Westerner to its ticket in a stepped-up effort to capture
California's 47 electoral votes _ Republican California Gov. George
Deukmejian, for instance. Recent polls suggest Dukakis has a
comfortable lead in California at this time.
   At the same time, the naming of Bentsen does nothing to detract
from arguments that Bush should choose a Midwesterner and shore up
support in an area also rich in electoral votes where Republicans
might otherwise have a difficult time this fall.
   That keeps alive prospects that Bush might name Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kans., a ticket popular with many Republicans, or another
Midwesterner _ possibly Illinois Gov. James Thompson or Sen. Nancy
Kassebuam.
   Bush campaign officials and GOP consultants say the Bentsen
selection leaves the choice of Bush's running mate wide open. Thus,
Bush supporters welcomed the naming of Bentsen, even if some did so
a bit warily.
   Bush himself had little to say about the selection, telling
reporters on Air Force II on his way to Cincinnati for the All-Star
baseball game, ``That's interesting, that's what I think.''
   GOP consultant Eddie Mahe said ``Bush is in tall cotton today.
He's now free to choose anyone he wishes to choose.''
   Mahe denied that Bentsen would carry the South for the
Democrats, saying, ``No one thinks Lloyd Bentsen is a Southerner.
And he's surely not a Westerner. He's never been in a room with a
pair of boots.''
   However, Mahe and some other GOP advisers suggest that Bush
might do well to consider a conservative for the ticket. Mahe's own
choice? Either Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor or Rep.
Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   For one thing, Bush is likely to step up his own selection of a
running mate now that the Democratic ticket is a known quantity.
   ``He will take a look at the process quickly,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Sheila Tate. She said Bush would meet this week with
campaign adviser Robert Teeter, who is overseeing Bush's vice
presidential selection effort.
   However, Ms. Tate said Bush still plans to withhold announcing
his choice until the Republican National Convention _ if that is
possible.
   Bush backers reject the comparison that Democrats are making to
the 1960 ticket of Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Senate
Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson of Texas.
   ``I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseaum. There's a
slight difference, of course. He (Bentsen) was not selected by his
peers to be in leadership; nor is Dukakis John Kennedy,'' said Rep.
Lynn Martin, R-Ill., co-chairwoman of Bush's campaign.

<HEAD>Uterine Monitoring Can Help Prevent Premature Births, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Simple, inexpensive monitoring of uterine
contractions during pregnancy can help predict and prevent the
birth of premature infants, whose medical care costs the nation $2
billion annually, a new study shows.
   The monitoring, done once a week beginning in the seventh month
of pregnancy, identified 70 percent of women who later gave birth
to premature infants, said the study's author, Dr. Michael Katz of
the Children's Hospital of San Francisco.
   ``We can use this data to make prematurity a preventable
event,'' Katz said Tuesday. ``Not always _ but most of it,'' he
said.
   About 350,000 babies are born prematurely in the United States
each year, said Richard Leavitt, a spokesman for the March of Dimes
in White Plains, N.Y. Ten percent of them have serious health
problems, and the bill for intensive care for premature infants
totals $2 billion each year, Leavitt said.
   Until now, doctors have had few ways to identify women likely to
give birth prematurely, Katz said in New York at a reporters'
seminar sponsored by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital of
Memphis, Tenn.
   He noted that prevention of premature births could cut medical
costs drastically by reducing reliance on extremely expensive
intensive care units for newborns.
   The techniques he has devised to prevent premature births might
add $100 or $200 to the cost of a pregnant woman's health care, he
said. In comparison, it costs about $2,000 per day to treat a
premature infant in a newborn intensive care unit, he said.
   Dr. Russell Chesney, professor of pediatrics at the University
of Tennessee and past president of the Society for Pediatric
Research, said after hearing Katz's presentation, ``I was struck by
his results. ... If we could identify those people who would
benefit, it would be very exciting.''
   Chesney added, however, that many low-income women might not be
helped by Katz's methods because they don't consult an obstetrician
during their pregnancy. ``You don't see them _ they show up two
weeks before delivery,'' he said.
   Low-income women often cannot afford prenatal care, and lack of
prenatal care is statistically linked to a much higher probability
of premature birth.
   Katz said his research has focused on the early identification
and treatment of women likely to have premature births _ not on the
social problem of getting care to women who can't afford it.
   The key to early identification is a device called a
tocodynamometer, a small instrument worn around the waist that
measures contractions of the uterus.
   In a study of 150 black, inner-city women in Philadelphia, Katz
and Dr. Denise Main of Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco measured
the women's uterine contractions with a tocodynamometer in a
doctor's office for one hour, once a week, from the 28th to the
32nd weeks of pregnancy, Katz said.
   Women who had more than six contractions during an hour's
monitoring were considered at risk of premature birth, Katz said.
(The contractions are mostly too mild for pregnant women to feel,
he said.)
   That simple method picked out 70 percent of the women who later
went on to have premature infants, he said.
   In subsequent studies, Katz has shown that judicious use of
so-called tocolytic drugs to control contractions can reduce
substantially the incidence of premature births.
   He emphasized that the women studied did not have any of the
traditional risk factors for prematurity, such as carrying more
than one fetus or having a history of preterm labor.

   An opposition leader says the
Sandinista government's crackdown on domestic critics is meant to
improve its negotiating position in future peace talks with Contra
rebels.
   Adan Fletes, a director of the Social Christian Party, also said
Tuesday that the leftist government's expulsion of eight U.S.
diplomats, including Ambassador Richard Melton, reflected an
``extreme radicalization'' in policy after President Daniel
Ortega's June 27-30 visit to Cuba.
   The government on Monday accused the Americans of inciting
unrest and gave them 72 hours to leave the country. Melton left
Nicaragua Tuesday. The U.S. Embassy said the seven others will
leave Thursday.
   In Washington, President Reagan retaliated by ordering
Nicaragua's ambassador and seven other Sandinista diplomats out of
the United States.
   Also Monday, the government closed the Roman Catholic Church's
radio station, Radio Catolica, and shut down the only opposition
newspaper, La Prensa, for 15 days.
   The actions mark a sharp setback in democratic reforms made in
recent months to comply with a regional peace plan that aims, in
part, to end Nicaragua's nearly 7-year-old civil war.
   Fletes told The Associated Press the Sandinistas are seeking to
use the crackdown on dissent as a bargaining chip in future peace
talks with the U.S.-supported Contras, who suffered a major blow in
February when Congress refused Reagan's request to continued
supplying them with military aid.
   Fletes said the government could offer an easing of press
restrictions and more political freedom in exchange for rebel
concessions.
   He did not say what advantages the government could seek.
   The Sandinistas said part of an alleged U.S. plan to destabilize
their government was put into effect Sunday in Nandaime, a town 40
miles south of the capital, where fighting broke out between
security forces and some of the estimated 10,000 demonstrators at
an anti-government rally.
   The Sandinistas called the alleged plan between the embassy and
the domestic opposition ``Plan Melton.''
   Some U.S. Embassy personnel attended the rally, but the embassy
said it is normal for its diplomats to maintain contact with
Nicaraguans.
   Ortega said the decision to expel the diplomats was made so the
United States would ``learn to respect this country and its
people.'' He said Nicaragua is ``prepared to confront any type of
American escalation'' as a result.
   State-run television reported Tuesday night that the government
had determined the eight U.S. diplomats were CIA agents. It did not
elaborate.
   An Interior Ministry statement charged La Prensa with violating
internal security and national defense. It said the paper incited
violence and subverted public order.
   The Sandinistas claim La Prensa is the ``voice of the CIA.'' The
paper receives U.S. funding through the National Endowment for
Democracy.
   On Sunday, Radio Catolica's programming included Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo's homily in which he defended ``the right of the
people to civic protest.''
   Cristina Chamorro, assistant director of La Prensa, said the
closings of the opposition daily and Radio Catolica ``flagrantly
violate the commitments signed by the Sandinista government'' under
the regional peace plan and a March 23 preliminary peace accord
with the rebels.
   ``The government of President Daniel Ortega, demonstrating its
incapacity to fulfill its obligations to initiate a democratic
process in Nicaragua, has decided to silence the Nicaraguan
people,'' she said in a statement Tuesday.
   In compliance with the regional peace plan signed last August,
the Sandinistas allowed Radio Catolica and La Prensa to reopen in
October after keeping them shut for more than a year.
   The government also began authorizing opposition demonstrations,
including Sunday's rally.
   The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, an umbrella organization
of opposition groups that organized Sunday's demonstration, charged
Tuesday that hundreds of its members were being rounded up by
police.
   There was no confirmation from the government.
   A Coordinate delegation will meet with President Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica in San Jose on Thursday, said Alberto Saborio of the
Conservative Party.
   Arias won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the
regional peace plan.

<HEAD>Job Corps Recruit Sues Over AIDS Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Job Corps says testing
candidates for AIDS without their knowledge ``is totally against
our policy'' even though a recruit claims he was tested unwittingly
and expelled after showing exposure to the deadly disease.
   But Job Corps director Peter Rell said he was not aware of the
specific case of James Dorsey, 19, who has filed suit against the
agency.
   Dorsey says he suffered ``severe emotional distress, trauma,
fear and humiliation'' when informed of the results of the test
that he had not been previously told was performed on his blood.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court on Tuesday, seeks an
injunction to bar the Job Corps from expelling recruits based on
test results showing the presence of antibodies against the disease.
   Rell said corps policy ``calls for informing the young people
when they come in that they are going to have their initial
physical examination, including the fact they are going to be
tested for AIDS.''
   The policy, which applies to 36,000 recruits who live at 105 Job
Corps residential training centers, provides counseling and help
enrolling in a non-residential program if possible for those
testing positive, Rell said.
   The Job Corps is required under the policy to refer the recruit
to a doctor and ``to attempt to follow up for 90 days,'' Rell said.
   The lawsuit said, however, that the policy ``ignores the
overwhelming consensus among medical and public health authorities
that mandatory ... testing does not inhibit or prevent the spread
of AIDS,'' the lawsuit said.
   Such testing ``helps create a climate of fear, suspicion and
discrimination,'' the lawsuit said.
   Expelling recruits who test positive violates the Rehabilitation
Act's ban on discriminating against anyone with a physical
handicap, the lawsuit said.
   The Job Corps is just one of a few federal agencies that test
for AIDS. Military recruits and foreign service employees of the
State Department and the Agency for International Development are
also tested.
   A court challenge by foreign service officers was rejected last
year by a federal judge here.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled in that case that
the State Department was justified in testing for AIDS to ensure
that no foreign service officer with AIDS was sent to a country
where there were inadequate facilities to treat the disease.

   Vietnamese soldiers helped load 72 tons of
marijuana onto a ship off Danang, Vietnam, a Coast Guard officer
said in a hearing for 18 men arrested in what officials call the
largest West Coast maritime drug bust.
   The Coast Guard cutter Boutwell seized the Panamanian-registered
Encounter Bay on June 30 when it was 500 miles off the Washington
coast. Coast Guard officials last week said the vessel was boarded
because it looked suspicious.
   The hearing, which continues today, was to determine whether
there was enough evidence to prosecute the 18 crew members, who
could face potential prison terms of several years to life.
   Lt. Thomas Rogers testified Tuesday the Coast Guard had prior
information that about 72 tons of high-grade Thai marijuana was
loaded off Danang.
   Rogers, the law enforcement officer aboard the Boutwell, said he
didn't know whether the cargo was already aboard when the crew got
on the ship.
   Asked by defense lawyer Peter Mair what he knew about who loaded
the ship, Rogers said, ``The only additional information I can
recall is that the Vietnamese army was involved.'' He did not
elaborate.
   ``I am shocked'' at the revelation, Mair said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Diskin refused to comment after
the hearing.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Bangkok,
Thailand, say there have been reports of merchant vessels taking on
drugs in Danang for shipment to international markets. In addition,
there have been unconfirmed reports that impoverished Vietnam has
been growing opium to pay foreign debts.
   Defense lawyers for the crewmen arrested on felony charges of
intent to distribute marijuana have tried to prove the seizure,
which the Coast Guard has called the largest maritime drug bust off
the West Coast, was illegal and the crew's constitutional rights
were violated.
   Rogers testified he didn't know whether documentation was found
on board that would clarify when and where various crew members
boarded.
   Defense lawyers argued that the U.S. government can't prove that
the crew knew what was aboard the Encounter Bay and that there
wasn't probable cause to stop the ship.
   Rogers testified he believed the crew members were told their
rights but didn't know whether the rights, probably read in
English, were understood by the crewmen from Southeast Asia.
   The Encounter Bay crew members are three Americans, one from
England, one from New Zealand and 13 from Indonesia, Thailand and
Singapore.
   Howard Weitzman of Los Angeles, representing crew member Samuel
J. Colflesh, 31, of Philadelphia, and other defense lawyers have
questioned whether the Coast Guard had the authority to fire upon,
board, search and seize the 180-foot converted oil rig supply ship
in international waters.
   U.S. Magistrate John Weinberg would not allow questions about
the Encounter Bay's destination, saying it was irrelevant to the
proceeding.
   Attorney John Muenster, representing Terrance Albert Nolan, 36,
of the United States, said the ship's destination was relevant,
since part of the charges against the crew require that the
government prove the ship had either left or was approaching a U.S.
port, or was in ``U.S. Customs territory,'' a term that neither he
nor Rogers could define.
   Weinberg denied a request by defense lawyers for copies of all
Coast Guard communications leading to the Encounter Bay's seizure,
saying the question of jurisdiction on the high seas should be
addressed at later hearings.

   A financial officer who worked 24 years for
the Agency for International Development faces arraignment today on
charges he stole $1.2 million from the government by issuing checks
to a fictitious person.
   William J. Burns, 48, of Burtonsville, Md., was taken into
custody at his office Tuesday after being charged in a complaint
with stealing AID money, making false claims against the government
and racketeering, an AID statement said. Burns allegedly embezzled
the money over a six-year period, the statement said.
   Herbert Beckington, AID's inspector general, said Burns'
``unexplained affluence'' first caught the attention of security
investigators performing a routine security evaluation last year.
   Burns earned $35,108 annually, but he lived in a neighborhood of
$500,000 estates, and he was able to enjoy ``expensive cars,
travel, exquisite home furnishings and other embellishments
normally beyond the reach of'' civil servants of his rank, the
statement said.
   An investigation by AID, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and
the Internal Revenue Service determined that Burns allegedly ran a
scheme that involved the issuing of fictitious U.S. government
checks to a fictitious person named ``Victor Kauffman,'' whose only
known address was a Post Office box.
   The money deposited in the Kauffman account was later
transferred to Burns' account at another bank, the AID statement
said.
   Gene Richardson, the assistant inspector general for
investigations at AID, said ``weak internal controls allowed these
taxpayers' dollars to be diverted in a sophisticated yet simple
manner that avoided detection year after year.''

<HEAD>Senator's Relative Was Mass. Senator and Vice President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In accepting Democrat Michael S. Dukakis' offer to
run for vice president, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen referred to a
distant relative who took the same route from the Senate to the
second-highest post in the land.
   But he left out one detail: his great-great-uncle Henry Wilson
was a Republican.
   ``I'm delighted to be back in the state where my
great-great-uncle was a senator from Massachusetts and became vice
president of the United States and we're out to duplicate that
record today,'' Bentsen said Tuesday as he accepted Dukakis' offer.
   Henry Wilson, vice president from 1873-75 under Ulysses S.
Grant, was a staunch abolitionist crediting with helping found the
Republican Party in the 1850s.
   Bill Maddox, a spokesman for Bentsen, confirmed that the senator
and Wilson are related but did not know the lineage.
   Wilson was senator from Massachusetts from 1855 until 1873, when
he became vice president. Before that, he served in both houses of
the Massachusetts legislature and was state Senate president but
was defeated when he ran for governor in 1853.
   Wilson's portrait hangs in the Massachusetts Senate Reading
Room. After addressing the state Senate on Tuesday, Dukakis,
Bentsen and Bentsen's wife, Beryl, made a brief detour into the
Reading Room to view the portrait.
   In remarks to the Massachusetts House, Bentsen noted that his
great-great-uncle had served 18 years in the U.S. Senate _ just
like Bentsen _ then went on to become vice president. He said that
``sounds like a good idea to me.''
   According to the U.S. House of Representatives history office,
Wilson was a delegate to the Whig party national convention in 1848
but withdrew from the party because it rejected an anti-slavery
resolution.
   Wilson died in office in the Capitol building on Nov. 22, 1875,
at the age of 63.

   Stock prices dropped slightly on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today, and the dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 113.85-point
winner Tuesday, shed 79.74 points, or 0.28 percent, to close the
day's trading at 28,020.10 points.
   The dollar finished at 132.47 yen, down 0.23 yen from Tuesday's
132.70 yen close. It opened at 132.33 yen and traded mainly between
132.27 yen and 132.58 yen during the day.
   Traders said the stock market opened in a bullish mood but
started falling in midmorning trading.
   ``I don't see an outstanding factor which caused the decline,''
said a trader at a major securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Investors are sidelined until the release of the trade
figures in the United States at the end of the week.''
   The U.S. Commerce Department is due to release a trade report
for the month of May on Friday.
   Another trader, who also spoke privately, said the fall of share
prices for no particular reason indicates that the market may have
hit its ceiling.

<HEAD>Deaver Sentencing Set For Sept. 23</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Michael K. Deaver is
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 23 for lying to a grand jury and a
House subcommittee about his lobbying business.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on Tuesday also
scheduled a Sept. 15 hearing to take testimony about Deaver's
problems with alcohol, which the defense contended impaired
Deaver's memory when he gave sworn testimony two years ago.
   Testimony about Deaver's alcoholism would be offered by the
defense to show there were mitigating circumstances to warrant a
short sentence or probation.
   A recovering alcoholic, Deaver was convicted Dec. 16, 1987 on
three counts of lying to a grand jury and a House subcommittee
about the lobbying business he formed in 1985 after resigning as
President Reagan's deputy chief of staff.
   He could be sentenced up to five years in prison for each of the
perjury convictions.

   Civil rights groups are organizing a 25th
Anniversary March on Washington Aug. 27. to focus on the need ``to
reorder the national agenda.''
   ``It's not only a commemorative service,'' the Rev. Joseph
Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
said after a planning meeting Tuesday.
   ``We have to realize that after seven long, hard, difficult
years of opposing this administration's efforts to dismantle
affirmative action, reverse civil rights laws there is a need now
... to go on the offensive.''
   Lowery and Coretta Scott King are leading plans for the march,
which will mark the 25th anniversary of the 1963 rally at the
Lincoln Memorial that gave momentum to the civil rights movement.
   Major issues that will be highlighted under the march's ``Jobs,
Peace and Justice'' banner include employment, wages, education,
homelessness, and aid to struggling families and the working poor.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Director Joshua Logan, who enthralled post-World
War II theatergoers with his deft staging of ``South Pacific,''
``Annie Get Your Gun'' and other Broadway hits, has died at the age
of 79.
   Although he was known primarily as a stage director, Logan also
directed several successful films, including ``Paint Your Wagon,''
``Camelot'' and the memorable 1956 screen adaption of ``Bus Stop,''
starring Marilyn Monroe.
   The 1949 musical ``South Pacific,'' which he co-wrote,
co-produced and directed, won the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for drama.
   Logan died Tuesday at his Manhattan home of a rare, progressive
neurological disease called supranuclear palsy, said his widow,
actress Nedda Harrigan.
   ``No matter how sick he was and how awful it was for him he
never complained,'' said Logan's son, Thomas. ``He went out with a
lot of courage.''
   As a director, Logan was known for his fluid staging,
particularly in supervising the story-heavy musicals that were
popular after World War II.
   Although his Broadway career began in 1932 and continued for
more than 40 years, Logan's biggest stage successes were in the
late 1940s and early '50s. They included such hits as ``Happy
Birthday,'' ``John Loves Mary,'' ``Wish You Were Here,''
``Picnic,'' ``Kind Sir'' and ``Fanny.''
   That golden period began after Logan got out of the Army in 1945
and Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein asked him to direct a new
musical they were producing but not writing. The composer was
Irving Berlin, and the star was Ethel Merman. The show, ``Annie Get
Your Gun,'' told the story of Annie Oakley. It opened on May 16,
1946, and ran for 1,147 performances.
   In 1948, Logan directed and helped write the stage version of
``Mister Roberts,'' Thomas Heggen's best seller about the officers
and crew aboard a Navy cargo ship in the Pacific during World War
II. The play, with Henry Fonda originating the title role, ran for
nearly three years.
   ``South Pacific,'' which opened the next year and starred Mary
Martin and Ezio Pinza, was the biggest hit of Logan's stage career.
It ran for 1,925 performances.
   Logan co-produced and co-wrote the show with Hammerstein, but
the Pulitzer committee mistakenly awarded the 1950 drama prize to
Rodgers and Hammerstein.
   The error was corrected, but as Logan wrote in ``Josh,'' his
autobiography: ``My name had been so minimized that I lived through
years of having people praise `South Pacific' in my presence
without knowing I had had anything to do with it.''
   Among Logan's movies, mostly film versions of Broadway
successes, were ``Picnic'' (1955); ``Sayonara,'' (1957); ``South
Pacific'' (1958); ``Tall Story'' (1960); ``Fanny,'' (1961);
``Camelot'' (1967) and ``Paint Your Wagon'' (1969).
   Born in Texarkana, Texas, on Oct. 5, 1908, Logan attended
Princeton University and also studied at the Moscow Art Theater
under Constantin Stanislavsky. After founding a small theater
company in the early 1930s, he made his New York stage debut in
1932 in ``Carrie Nation.'' Three years later, Logan directed on
Broadway for the first time in the comedy ``To See Ourselves,'' but
didn't attract attention until 1938, when he staged ``On Borrowed
Time.''
   Logan's later efforts on Broadway were unsuccessful. In 1962, he
directed two big flop musicals _ ``All American,'' which starred
Ray Bolger, and ``Mr. President,'' Irving Berlin's last musical.
``Miss Moffat,'' a 1974 musical version of ``The Corn Is Green''
starring Bette Davis, died out of town.
   Logan was a manic-depressive, and he often participated in
medical seminars on the mental illness and appeared on television
to discuss it, saying he felt its manic phase contributed to his
creativity.
   He wrote about the illness in ``Movie Stars, Real People, and
Me,'' a collection of anecdotes about his life. Without the
illness, he said, ``I would have missed the sharpest, the rarest
and, yes, the sweetest moments of my existence.''
   Logan began taking lithium carbonate in 1969 to control the
ailment.
   Miss Harrigan said no funeral arrangements would be announced.
``We're going to have it very, very private, just the family.
That's what he requested,'' she said.
   Logan is survived by his wife; a daughter, Harrigan Logan of Los
Angeles; Thomas, a musician, composer and writer who lives in New
York City; and a 9-year-old granddaughter.

<HEAD>Salinas Thanks Supporters, Opponents Vow Fraud Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party's Carlos Salinas de
Gortari celebrated a presidential victory while his two main
opponents called for street demonstrations to protest alleged vote
fraud in last week's election.
   The Federal Electoral Commission, which is dominated by the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, said it would not
release final official results until tonight at the earliest.
   But partial returns show Salinas winning with just over half of
the vote, the lowest margin of victory for a presidential candidate
in the party's 59-year history.
   The party, known by its Spanish initials PRI, has never lost a
presidential race and usually wins with 70 percent of the vote.
   Leaders of Mexico's largest peasant, labor and popular
organizations _ the three traditional pillars of support for the
governing party _ toasted Salinas at party headquarters on Tuesday.
   ``We believe that today we are stronger than before these
elections,'' said Fidel Velazquez, veteran leader of the powerful
Mexican Labor Confederation, who referred to the candidate as
``president-elect.''
   The confederation claims more than 5 million members.
   Salinas thanked Velazquez for the confederation's support and
promised to achieve ``necessary progress in (workers') living
standards.''
   He declared victory on Thursday, one day after the voting.
   Opposition presidential candidate Manuel Clouthier and about 150
supporters scuffled with presidential guards on Tuesday, then vowed
to lead sit-ins wherever President Miguel de la Madrid and Salinas
make public appearances.
   He called for a national civil disobedience campaign.
   Unofficial returns show Clouthier, of the conservative National
Action Party, running third behind Salinas and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
of the leftist National Democratic Front.
   Clouthier and Cardenas charge the PRI is taking advantage of the
slow vote count to doctor the final results in favor of Salinas.
   As de la Madrid arrived at the Fine Arts Palace in downtown
Mexico City to make a speech to about 2,500 lawyers, Clouthier
stood up, carrying a sign that read, ``Mr. President, keep your
word.''
   He and supporters pushed past a line of about 50 plainclothes
guards who tried to stop them.
   After a scuffle, the group sat down at the entrance to the
building.
   Inside, de la Madrid pledged to ensure ``that the remaining
stages of the electoral process occur with strict attachment to
legality.''
   Clouthier also filed criminal charges with the federal Attorney
General against Jose Newman Valenzuela, director of the National
Electoral Registry. He charged Newman with overseeing the tampering
of voter registration rolls to benefit candidates of the governing
party.
   During a rally attended by about 1,500 supporters in the city's
downtown Solidarity Park, Cardenas announced a protest march
against fraud for Saturday.
   ``Our country already is mobilized. Our companions in all of the
Republic ... are deciding not only to defend the personal vote of
each person. We are deciding to defend the democracy of the
country,'' he said.
   The crowd frequently interrupted Cardenas' speech with chants of
``Death to the PRI!'' and ``The people voted and Cardenas won!''
   A week after the elections, the Federal Electoral Commission
still has not finished releasing official results for the Chamber
of Deputies, the lower house of Congress.
   The PRI on Tuesday released data it attributed to the commission
that shows Salinas had 53.59 percent of the votes counted. Cardenas
was second with 26.08 percent and Clouthier had 16.04 percent.
   It did not say how many votes had been counted, but said that
voter turnout had been 51.7 percent and that the results accounted
for 235 of 300 elecotral districts. Mexico has 38 million
registered voters.
   Partial commission results gave 241 of the 500 seats in the
chamber to the governing party, 32 to the National Action Party and
10 to parties that support Cardenas.

   When Sen. Lloyd Bentsen was being suggested as
a possible candidate for vice president in 1984, he mentioned to a
friend that the No. 2 job had been pure misery for fellow Texan
Lyndon B. Johnson.
   ``LBJ had been one of the most powerful members of government
when he was in the Senate and was second banana at the White House,
taking orders from Kennedy's aides,'' the friend remembered Bentsen
complaining.
   Four years later, political realities and Bentsen's horizons
have changed. He eagerly announced Tuesday he was accepting an
invitation from Michael S. Dukakis to be his running mate.
   ``We're going to fight for every state in the union and we're
going all out to win,'' he vowed in Boston, with Dukakis at his
side.
   Bentsen, 67, is tall, thin and well-dressed, a millionaire, a
highly decorated World War II bomber pilot, lawyer, Presbyterian
and native Texan who has close ties with business, a strong record
on civil rights and a history of supporting two of his home state's
biggest industries: oil and the military. Like Dukakis, he speaks
fluent Spanish.
   He is a forceful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee who is
seldom heard to raise his voice, a congressional insider who in
1976 made a short-lived run for the presidency. Bentsen is credited
with having the strongest political organization seen in Texas in
modern times; it was he who denied George Bush a seat in the Senate.
   Bentsen's marked success at fund-raising produced the only thing
approaching a personal scandal during his time in Washington.
   Immediately after ascending to the chairmanship of the Finance
Committee in January 1987, Bentsen sent word to lobbyists and other
potential contributors that he would be glad to have breakfast with
them once a month _ for a $10,000 contribution. Once the story
broke and critics raised the specter of a powerful lawmaker
offering himself for sale, it took Bentsen only a couple days to
back down.
   ``I'm not known to make many mistakes, but when I do it's a
doozy,'' he said in a statement, ``and in forming that breakfast
club I really blew it.... The last thing I want is anything that
would reflect on my integrity.''
   Until taking over the Finance Committee, Bentsen was little
known outside the Washington establishment, despite six years in
the House and 16 years in the Senate.
   He had had a stint in the late 1970s as chairman of the Joint
Economic Committee, a panel that does not write legislation, and
used the post to advocate tax cuts to spur investment and savings _
long before President Reagan came to power with promises of such a
program.
   By the time Sen. Russell B. Long, D-La., retired as chairman of
the Finance Committee in 1986, giving Bentsen a chance to push his
own ideas, Reagan's plan had been written into law.
   Bentsen often is described as a centrist. In 1986, a
conservative rating group gave him a 50 for his Senate votes; a
liberal group rated him at 45. He supported Democratic party-line
votes 46 percent of the time and opposed them 50 percent of the
time.
   As chairman of the Finance Committee, Bentsen is well-placed to
put his mark on legislation dealing with taxes, trade, welfare,
health insurance and Social Security. As chairman, he seems to push
for the middle ground as often as he was pulled toward a consensus
in earlier days on the committee.
   Thus, in an effort to get a trade bill that President Reagan
would sign, Bentsen accepted several House provisions, especially
those aimed at protecting U.S. workers and at retaliating against
unfair trade practices, that were less than he wanted.
   Republicans controlled the Finance Committee when the massive
1986 tax overhaul was enacted, and Bentsen faced the prospect of
voting to repeal major provisions _ including the investment credit
and capital-gains preferences _ that he had supported. In the end,
he voted for repeal in order to pay for a significant rate
reduction for most individuals and corporations, but he was never
enthusiastic about the package.
   The Texan has fought feverishly to retain special tax treatment
for the oil industry, especially the independent companies not
affiliated with the giant major firms.
   But his biggest battle over the 1986 bill was waged for the
benefit of real-estate developers, not the oil industry. And
ironically, it was Bentsen himself who had spurred the committee to
eliminate some tax incentives for investment in commercial real
estate; he pointed to a 35 percent vacancy rate in Houston offices
buildings to support his case.
   Under Bentsen's leadership, the Finance Committee this year has
cranked out landmark bills overhauling the welfare system and
expanding Medicare to cover some costs of catastrophic illness.
   Bentsen, who served briefly as a county judge, used his family's
considerable wealth to win election to the House for the first time
in 1948. At age 33, he retired after three terms to run his own
lucrative insurance business.
   He won election to the Senate in 1970 by unseating liberal Sen.
Ralph Yarborough in the Democratic primary. He defeated Bush in
November with 54 percent of the votes and was re-elected in 1976
with 57 percent and in 1982 with 59 percent.
   Bentsen has been married for 44 years to Beryl Ann Bentsen _
known as B.A. _ a former fashion model. They have three grown
children.

   Reinhold's rented 1988 Ford Mustang had to be towed from the

   Silsby was ticketed for failing to use due care. Reinhold, a Los

injuries but refused treatment, police said.
   The actor was taken to police headquarters to arrange a ride to

   A ferry boat for gamblers and casino
workers collided with a cruise boat and capsized on the fast-moving
Colorado River Tuesday night, injuring more than a dozen people
tossed in the water, authorities said.
   Two people initially had been feared dead, but all passengers
were accounted for by midnight, said Janet Smith, a spokeswoman for
Mercy Ambulance. Four people were hospitalized for observation
overnight.
   The collision at 9:30 p.m. overturned the pontoon-equipped ferry
and spilled from 20 to 30 people into the water, authorities said.
   The boat belonged to the Colorado Belle, a hotel-casino in this
tiny gaming resort in the southern tip of the state, according to
Las Vegas Metro Police spokesman Robert Nixon.
   Nixon said the boat capsized on Arizona side of the river at the
town of Bullhead City.
   Bullhead City Assistant Fire Chief Bill Wagner said divers from
his department and the Laughlin fire department began searching the
river immediately, and a state Department of Public Safety
helicopter was called to participate in the search.
   Rescuers pulled 18 people from the water and took them to
Bullhead City Community Hospital for treatment, Ms. Smith said.
   At least a dozen people suffered injuries, including head
injuries and hypothermia, said fire Capt. Joe Anderson, of Bullhead
City.

   The world's biggest aquarium, featuring
more than 5,000 fish in glass-bottomed tanks as large as
Olympic-sized swimming pools, opened today.
   The Guiness Book of World Records recognizes the $24 million
aquarium at Darling Harbor in downtown Sydney as the world's
largest, with 780,000 gallons of water.
   Aquarium director John Burgess told a news conference that 1
million visitors a year are expected to visit the complex.
   The aquarium has two large oceanariums, a crocodile pool with
three saltwater crocodiles and 50 tanks for fish, turtles and coral.
   Moving walkways along the base of the oceanariums, with the
water arching overhead, give visitors an ocean-floor view of sea
life. One houses sea life found in Sydney Harbor, the other has
marine life found in the open ocean, such as gray nurse sharks.
   Only a layer of glass lies between visitors and the overhead
water.

   A French woman claims her daughter is the young
woman being sought for possible involvement in the terrorist attack
on a Greek cruise ship, but says her daughter has no connection
with terrorists.
   The woman, identifying herself only as Mrs. Bismuth, called the
French news agency Agence France-Presse on Tuesday to say she was
certain a photo she saw on the evening news showing a woman playing
cards with a young man aboard the boat was her daughter. The
picture was distributed by Greek authorities.
   She said she had not heard from her daughter since the Monday
attack. Gunmen on the crowded ship tossed grenades and fired on
passengers, killing 11 and injuring about 100.
   Mrs. Bismuth said her daughter, Isabelle, 21, was a secretary
vacationing in Greece since Saturday and not a terrorist.
   ``I saw the photos of terrorists and I identified my daughter as
the young woman playing cards on the boat with a young man,'' Mrs.
Bismuth said. She added that she was ``sure without a doubt'' this
was her daughter ``and she has no ties with terrorists.''
   The woman said she received a call Tuesday from Isabelle's
traveling companion who told her that ``she lost all trace of my
daughter at the moment of the commando attack. Since then there is
no news of her.''

<HEAD>Scientists Propose $4.2 Million, High-Tech Quake-Monitoring System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers want to build a
high-fidelity ``telescope'' network to peer inside the Earth for
signs of big, small and ``silent'' earthquakes and to track the
drift of continental plates.
   The proposed $4.2 million Terrascope system of 10 earthquake
monitors would quickly provide detailed information about quakes,
letting scientists ``learn as much as possible as fast as possible
so we can keep the public informed about what is happening,''
seismologist Don Anderson said Tuesday.
   Terrascope would be the world's largest continuously operating
scientific instrument, said Robert Finn, spokesman for the
California Institute of Technology. Some arrays of dish-shaped
radio telescopes are spread over a larger area, but they don't scan
the heavens continuously, he said.
   The system is called a terrestrial telescope because it would
use seismic waves to make pictures of Earth's interior, just as
optical telescopes use light waves to make pictures of objects in
space, said Anderson, director of the Caltech's seismological
laboratory.
   The contrast between the proposed network of seismic monitors in
Southern California and existing quake-monitoring networks ``is
like comparing a compact disc recording with the original
phonographs,'' Anderson said.
   ``This new array will be able to detect the very smallest
earthquakes as well as the very largest earthquakes with equal
fidelity,'' which existing seismic networks can't do, said Anderson.
   ``Small earthquakes tend to have very high frequencies like a
violin,'' Anderson said. ``Large quakes tend to be more booming,
like the bass section of an orchestra.''
   Terrascope should let scientists ``provide detailed information
on the characteristics of an earthquake within minutes after its
occurrence, maybe even while it is still happening,'' said Caltech
geophysicist Hiroo Kanamori.
   Even with the existing seismometers, which record quake waves as
they happen, Caltech scientists need 20 minutes or more to analyze
a quake's location and magnitude.
   Anderson said the seismometers also would measure ``silent''
quakes, which can have large magnitudes and generate giant sea
waves, but break the ground too slowly to be detected by the
existing Caltech-U.S. Geological Survey array of 250 conventional
seismometers.
   Each Terrascope station also will be equipped to transmit
signals to satellites in the government's Navstar Global
Positioning System. Such signals allow scientists to pinpoint the
location of each ground station so they can measure continental
drift, the slow movement of the plates that make up Earth's crust.
   Unlike conventional seismometers, Terrascope also would detect
very long-period waves generated as ``the Earth rings likes a bell
for months after a giant earthquake,'' Anderson said.
   By studying those waves, Terrascope ``will allow us to get a
better look at the structure of the Earth's interior'' using
seismic tomography, a method similar to the CAT scans that use
X-rays to make pictures of the inside of a human body, he added.
   Scientists from Caltech, Harvard University, the University of
Southern California and USGS installed the first of Terrascope's 10
seismometers about six months ago in Caltech's Kresge Lab, near the
Rose Bowl, at a cost of about $100,000.
   Researchers are talking to the governor's staff, state lawmakers
and private donors to raise the remainder of Terrascope's $4.2
million cost, Anderson said.
   The terrestrial telescope system would be part of a global
network of high-fidelity seismometers operated by the
Virginia-based Incorporated Research Institutions of Seismology,
which already has 10 of the devices operating around the world on a
non-continuous basis, Anderson said.
   When information from Terrascope and the Virginia-run network is
combined, ``we will be able to build up a three-dimensional picture
of Earth's interior with unprecedented clarity,'' Caltech
geophysicist Robert Clayton said.

<HEAD>Bentsen Draws Mixed Reviews From Women's Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's groups say Sen. Lloyd Bentsen offers a
mixed record on women's issues, but his stance on Contra aid and
defense spending could turn some female voters away from the
Democratic ticket in November.
   ``Basically, he's more a plus than he is a minus,'' Molly Yard,
president of the National Organization for Women, said after the
Texas senator was announced as Michael Dukakis running mate choice
Tuesday.
   ``I think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he is
very much a hawk. He was pro-Contra aid, and for all the money
spent on defense. He is really business as usual and that's why the
voters want change,'' she said.
   Irene Natividad, chairman of the National Women's Political
Caucus, said women's groups had not expected this year that
Democrats would name a woman vice president candidate because ``the
sense was that the Democratic Party felt they had already done a
women on the ticket.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who was Walter Mondale's running mate on the
losing Democratic ticket in 1984, said she was ``delighted'' by the
choice of Bentsen.

   Aides to Jesse Jackson say they are still
negotiating over minority planks in the Democratic Party platform,
but expect to bring some issues to the floor of next week's
Democratic National Convention.
   The Democratic Platform Committee released a 4,700-word proposed
platform Tuesday without the minority planks the Jackson campaign
has been pushing.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jesse Jackson's chief platform
negotiator, said, ``Our minority reports are not in there because
we're still negotiating.''
   Jackson has said he may press floor fights in Atlanta next
Tuesday on a dozen or more issues, including his call for higher
taxes on the wealthy, a Pentagon freeze, more spending on education
and Head Start, no-first-use of nuclear weapons and Palestinian
self-determination.
   With 1,135 delegates, Jackson can force debates on any issue,
but Dukakis's majority of 2,426 is large enough to leave no doubt
as to who will win the fights.
   The proposed platform avoids any mention of tax increases and
does not say how Dukakis and the Democrats would deal with the huge
federal deficits.

   The mayor of New Orleans says a work stoppage
of the sort staged this week by city police won't disrupt security
for next month's Republican National Convention.
   ``We have an alternative plan to deal with any problem,'' Mayor
Sidney Barthelemy said Tuesday at a news conference called in
response to Monday's 24-hour sick-out by almost one-fourth of the
1,350-member police force.
   The Police Association of New Orleans disclaimed any connection
with the sick-out, although PANO president Ron Cannatella said
Barthelemy's refusal to negotiate with the union and raise salaries
distressed many officers.
   Cannatella refused to rule out a job action during the
convention.
   Barthelemy refused to say how the city would deal with a police
job action during the convention Aug. 15-18, although about 60
Louisiana State Police troopers were brought in to work alongside
city police who worked Monday.
   State police are already planning to send about 130 troopers and
investigators to New Orleans for the convention.

   Stock prices fell sharply this morning on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange but regained ground in the afternoon to close
slightly lower, and the dollar inched down against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei stock average of 225 selected shares, the exchange's
main index, dropped 79.74 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at
28,020.10 points.
   The index, which moved above the 28,000 mark Tuesday first time
in three weeks, fell 187.69 points due to profit-taking to end the
morning session at 27,912.15.
   Investors, however, took advantage of the lower prices and
heavily bought such issues as steel and ship-building shares in the
afternoon, brokers said.
   The volume traded on the exchange's first section was estimated
at 2 billion shares.
   Stock brokers said there was no particular reason why share
prices fluctuated.
   ``Today's activities reflected mixed feelings in the market,''
said a broker at a major securities firm who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Some investors are completely sidelined until the
release of the U.S. trade figures at the end of the week, while
others want to sell shares after the 18-point overnight fall in New
York.''
   The U.S. Commerce Department is scheduled to release its May
trade report Friday in Washington.
   In the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 132.47 yen,
down 0.23 yen from Tuesday's close.
   After opening at 132.33 yen, the U.S. currency traded in a range
of 132.27-132.58 yen.
   Exchange dealers also said activities were slow because traders
were awaiting the release of the U.S. trade figures.
   ``The market had no direction all day today,'' said a dealer at
a U.S. investment bank in Tokyo, who also spoke anonymously.
``Scattered pieces of information and speculation moved the rate
briefly, but it came right back to the lower- and mid-132.00's.''

<HEAD>Periodic Crashes Likely for NASA Shuttles, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A space shuttle is likely to crash every
five years under NASA's current schedule because key power units
will fail, predicts a NASA-funded study that was disputed by a
space agency official.
   The study said there was a 1-in-70 chance on any flight that the
shuttle's three auxiliary power units, which control flaps needed
to land, will all fail and cause the shuttle to crash, the San Jose
Mercury News reported Tuesday.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to
launch about 14 shuttle missions a year once it resumes its full
schedule in the early 1990s, said agency spokesman Steve Nesbitt.
That would mean 70 missions every five years.
   The $2 million study conducted by a consultant was among those
commissioned in the wake of the Challenger disaster on Jan. 28,
1986, to examine risk assessment by NASA.
   ``I know they're quoting 1 in 70, (but) in my opinion, the unit
is much more reliable than that'' based on results of NASA testing,
said Chester Vaughan, chief of the shuttle's power and propulsion
division at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``I think we have
a hell of a good unit.''
   The study's finding quantifies the potential dangers of just one
of the shuttle's two dozen critical systems, the Mercury News
reported.
   According to NASA tests, the power units are far more reliable
than the study indicates, and the agency has not changed plans to
resume launches this fall, NASA officials said. The space agency
said there is a plan to double the shuttles' lifespan from 20
missions to 40.
   However, independent experts and scientists close to NASA told
the Mercury News they were startled by the report.
   ``That's high (risk),'' said George Apostolakis, an expert in
risk assessment and a professor at the University of California,
Los Angeles.
   John Garrick, president of the Newport Beach consulting firm of
Pickard, Lowe and Garrick Inc., which conducted the study for
McDonnell Douglas Corp., stood by the findings.
   ``We have pretty high confidence in our results,'' said Garrick.
``In trying to tell the truth, the answers aren't exactly as
favorable as (NASA) would like.''
   The report recommended that NASA carry out similar studies on
other shuttle systems. The space agency plans studies on the main
engines and the 30,000 heat-resistant tiles on the shuttle's belly,
but nothing new on the auxiliary power units.
   NASA decided in 1987 to spend about $2 million on the McDonnell
Douglas probability study and a second study of the pressurizer
system for the main fuel tanks.
   The second study, conducted by Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.
in Palo Alto, found that a malfunction of that system would likely
cause a crash in about one of every 400 missions.

<HEAD>Well-Known Transplant Doctor Draws Criticism With Fast-Food
Restaurant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationally known transplant physician has
surprised some nutritionists by opening a fast-food restaurant
featuring fried foods that have been linked to heart disease.
   Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits, the new fast-food
restaurant that Dr. John Najarian opened Tuesday in Minneapolis,
offers fried chicken, onion rings, french fries and buttermilk
biscuits, among other fare.
   ``I think it's an embarrassment. ... The problem is his name
brings credibility to the food. (People will say,) `If the chief of
surgery is promoting this food, then it must be good for (you),'''
said Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-oriented group based in
Washington, D.C.
   ``I'm expecting it's going to be a real lean chicken, I mean,
(coming) from a surgeon,'' said Mark Anderson, editor of the
Whittier Globe, the neighborhood newspaper.
   Najarian, chief of surgery at the University of Minnesota
Hospital and personal physician to the late Hubert Humphrey,
defended his investment.
   ``It wouldn't be like backing a cigarette company or something
like that,'' said the 60-year-old kidney- and liver-transplant
physician. ``Today, the important thing is to get away from beef
and red meat. So what we stress, as physicians, is chicken and
fish. ... It's a heck of a lot better than Burger King or Wendy's.''
   Among his friends, Najarian's fast-food business is seen as in
keeping with his personality. ``He's country. ... He likes to go
down to the State Fair and munch on doughnuts,'' said Jim Johnson,
a long-time friend.
   Najarian, as president of Cajian Inc., holds the franchise
rights along with his family for Popeyes in the Twin Cities.
   A study of fast foods released by the Center for Science in the
Public Interest in 1986 said that Popeyes' french fries had the
second-highest percentage _ 55 percent _ of saturated beef fat,
surpassing both McDonald's and Wendy's. Saturated fat, according to
medical experts, tends to raise cholesterol levels in blood and
increases the risk of heart disease.
   Najarian's son, David, said the Cajun-style chicken at the
family's restaurant would be fried in vegetable oil, which is
considered less harmful to the health. But a Popeyes regional
official in Chicago said Tuesday that Najarian had misspoken.
   ``It's not vegetable oil,'' said Richard Karlsen, regional
operations manager for Popeyes' 153 Midwest locations, including
Minneapolis. He said all Popeyes use the same ingredients and
cooking methods, but he declined to say what shortening is used.
   Popeyes comprises more than 700 restaurants in 40 states and was
started in New Orleans in 1972.

<HEAD>New Hampshire, South Dakota Lead States in Manufacturing Study</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Embargoed for release at 11 a.m. EDT Wednesday, time set by
source. A version also moved on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New Hampshire and South Dakota lead the lower 48 states when it
comes to offering a favorable business environment, as wages
continue to top the list of concerns among manufacturers, according
to a private study released today.
   Based on 21 factors that include wages, energy costs, state
business incentives and education, New Hampshire offers ``many of
the economic and social qualities conducive to successful
manufacturing,'' said the accounting firm Grant Thornton.
   The factors were based on surveys of governors, state economic
development officials and statewide associations representing more
than 100,000 manufacturers, the New York-based firm stated.
   Wages were the single most important factor to the associations
when assessing business climates, the survey indicated. Available
workforce, unionization and workers' compensation insurance levels
were the next most important factors, respectively.
   For the first time in the nine consecutive years Grant Thornton
has conducted the study, the firm differentiated states by their
``manufacturing intensity'' to make state-to-state comparisons more
valid.
   States where total employment in manufacturing exceeded the
national average of 17 percent or where manufacturing shipments
exceeded the national average in dollar terms were considered
``intensive.''
   Ranked right behind New Hampshire on a list of 27 states deemed
as manufacturing intensive were Missouri, North Carolina, Delaware
and Florida.
   Heading the list of 21 states with a lighter concentration of
manufacturing was South Dakota, followed by North Dakota, Nebraska,
Nevada and Kansas.
   According to the study, South Dakota is the least unionized
state in the nation: only 3.1 percent of its workers are union
members, compared with a national average of almost 20 percent. The
state ranked as the most favorable among the 48 states in terms of
overall labor costs.
   Ironically, New Hampshire's overall labor costs put it at No. 35
when ranked among the 48 states. However, the Granite State's
government fiscal policies ranked first overall.
   North Carolina ranked first in terms of state-regulated
employment costs.
   Kansas ranked first in terms of availability and productivity of
resources, while North Dakota ranked first in terms of quality of
life, although the associations ranked factors such as cost of
living, health care and transportation as their least concerns.
   Other groups have made similar assessments of business climates
around the nation. The Corporation for Enterprise Development, a
Washington-based, non-profit economic development research and
consulting group, has used a broad range range of factors to make
its assessment.
   But Selwyn Price, a Grant Thornton partner, has said while his
firm's index also considers a range of factors, it weights them in
accordance with what manufacturers identified in a survey as
important.
   Alaska and Hawaii were not included in the survey because it
would be difficult to compare them with other states due to their
``substantially different economies,'' Grant Thornton stated.

   A domestic airliner carrying 173 people wound up
in a rice paddy when it ran short of fuel and made an emergency
landing, an official report said today.
   None of the 162 passengers, including 100 foreigners, or the 11
crew members were injured in the landing Monday evening, the
Guangming Daily said.
   The pilot landed the plane at the Jiujiang airport in eastern
China's Jiangxi province, but could not stop the plane in time and
ran off the runway into an adjoining paddy, the paper said.
   Japanese television on Tuesday night showed film shot by a
Japanese passenger of people climbing off the wings into the rice
paddy.
   The Guangming Daily said the runway was too short for landing
planes as large as the Soviet-designed Tupolev TU-154, a
three-engine plane that can accommodate up to 180 passengers.
   The plane was flying from Canton to Shanghai when it ran into
bad weather.
   The pilot increased altitude, but his navigation equipment and
radio failed, the paper said. After flying for an hour, he ran
short of fuel and decided to make an emergency landing in Jiujiang.
   Japanese sources said the plane began flying to Shanghai from
Urumqi in northwestern China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,
but diverted to Canton, hundreds of miles out of its way, to pick
up parts after developing an unspecified mechanical problem.
   Canton is 740 miles southwest of Shanghai and well off a direct
Urumqi-Shanghai flight path. It was not clear why the pilot needed
to go to Canton for the parts.
   The paper said the plane was stuck in the paddy, but did not say
what efforts were being made to pull it out.

   A ranking member of the Senate
Labor Committee eulogized Teamsters President Jackie Presser as a
courageous leader who laughed off ``bitter taunts that would have
hurt lesser men.''
   ``He could walk in all circles of our society and never lose
touch with himself. I hope Jackie Presser will be remembered for
what he accomplished,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch said Tuesday.
   Presser, a flamboyant, 350-pound figure who molded a large
Teamsters local in Cleveland and rose to the top job in the 1.6
million-member union in 1983, died at age 61 Saturday after a
battle with cancer.
   At his death, the president of the nation's biggest union was
under indictment on charges of taking part in a $700,000
payroll-padding scheme at his local. The trial had been delayed
indefinitely because of his health.
   Last month the government filed suit to oust the union
leadership and rid the Teamsters of alleged Mafia control.
   About 800 people jammed a funeral home for the memorial service
Tuesday.
   Hatch commended Presser for bringing the Teamsters back into the
AFL-CIO fold 30 years after they were expelled over corruption
allegations and for being the first Teamsters president to appear
before a Senate committee.
   ``He wanted people to know that there were people in the
Teamsters willing to stand up and face the public,'' the Utah
Republican said. ``He believed in the labor movement and he wasn't
afraid to stand up and say so, and I know what he went through. He
was courageous.''
   He said Presser ``was a tough guy but one with a heart. He
laughed infectiously at bitter taunts that would hurt lesser men.''
   Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, a Republican candidate for
Senate, said Presser was a major civic force for Cleveland who
helped the city out of default. Presser was vice president of a
state-appointed commission that oversaw Cleveland finances until a
year ago.
   ``I will remember Jackie Presser as a man who cared about his
city. I will miss him and pray for him,'' Voinovich said.
   Presser was buried next to his father, William ``Big Bill''
Presser, a president of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters who was
close to former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa. William Presser died in
1981.
   The entire executive committee of the Teamsters, including
acting president Weldon L. Mathis, attended the Jewish memorial
service and funeral. Presser had taken a medical leave of absence
May 4.

   Michael Dukakis' selection of Lloyd Bentsen as
his vice presidential choice likely will hasten George Bush's own
decision on a running mate, a spokeswoman for Bush says.
   Spokeswoman Sheila Tate said Tuesday that Bush, the certain
Republican presidential nominee, would meet with campaign
strategist and pollster Robert Teeter over the next few days to
discuss options. Teeter is overseeing the selection process.
   But Ms. Tate said Bush still does not intend to announce his
choice until the Republican National Convention in mid-August in
New Orleans.
   Meanwhile, Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater told reporters,
``The Democrats have thrown away the vice presidential selection as
far as I'm concerned.''
   Bentsen, who defeated Bush in a 1970 Senate race, will not carry
Texas for the Democrats, Atwater declared. ``George Bush is going
to win Texas,'' he said.
   Bush's only comment to reporters on Dukakis' selection of the
Texas senator was, ``That's interesting; that's what I think about
it.''
   Bush made the brief comment aboard Air Force Two on the ground
before flying to Cincinnati for the All-Star baseball game.
   When pressed for further comment, Bush suddenly noticed that a
guest _ the crown prince of Kuwait _ had just boarded the plane.
``Gotta go,'' Bush said.
   In Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, Bush _ first baseman and
captain of the 1948 Yale baseball team _ strode to the mound,
removed his blue warm-up jacket with a flourish, and threw the ball
over the head of National League catcher Gary Carter.
   Carter, of the New York Mets, leaped high and gloved Bush's
pitch.
   On Air Force Two, Bush waited until the plane was taxiing before
coming back to chat with reporters.
   ``What kind of reviews did I get on that throw?'' he asked. When
told it was kind of ``up there,'' Bush said, ``Way up there.''
   Then, before any further questions could be asked, the plane
began taking off _ and Bush rushed forward to take his seat in the
front, not to be seen again.
   Bush was to address a meeting of the Farm Bureau Federation here
later today and also was to meet privately with President Reagan.
   On Thursday, he will attend a fundraising breakfast in Baltimore.
   Aides said that Bush will spend Friday through Sunday fishing in
Wyoming with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, who is expected
to become his campaign chairman later this summer.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All commuter trains in South
Africa have been desegregated, and integration of long-haul
intercity trains is being considered, railroad officials said today.
   ``From now on segregation will be based only on economic
principles. South African Transport Services is a business
enterprise,'' said Transvaal province railroad manager J.C. van Der
Merwe.
   ``Whites Only'' signs on first-class commuter trains, which cost
about twice as much to ride as third-class, began coming down
Tuesday all over the country, railroad officials said. There is no
second-class service on commuter trains.
   Beginning in 1985, the Transport Services began integrating
restrooms, waiting areas, railroad cafeterias and other amenities
at train stations. Most carriages continued to be segregated,
although in 1985 a few first-class trains were declared open to all
races.
   Leon Els, a spokesman for Transport Minister Eli Louw, said
today in reference to the continued segregation on the country's
120 intercity trains: ``Nothing can change overnight. We still have
partial segregation on the intercity trains but it is being looked
at. We haven't put a time schedule to that. We have to see what is
practical.''
   Els said the considerations that have so far prevented
integration of intercity trains are the long travel distances
involved and the fact that ``the intercity trains are overnight
trains and people sleep in the compartments. People would be
sleeping in a compartment together.''
   One intercity train, the luxury Blue Train between Johannesburg
and Cape Town, is designated as an international service and always
has been desegregated.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Striking Writers File Antitrust Suit Against Leading Hollywood
Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The striking Writers Guild of
America has filed an antitrust suit claiming leading Hollywood
producers interfered with union efforts to sign contracts with
independent production companies.
   Among the 19 defendants named by in suit were the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers, the three TV networks and
several Hollywood studios, including Disney, Universal and Colombia.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court on Tuesday, seeks a
declaration that the defendants violated the law and an order that
they halt such activity.
   The 9,000 film and TV scriptwriters went on strike March 7 over
creative control and residuals. The union has signed interim
contracts with several independent production companies, allowing
some writers to go back to work.
   Guild attorneys said they had evidence that the defendants had
``refused to deal'' with some of the 151 companies that have signed
interim contracts.
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said the allegations ``have no
merit.''
   Representatives of independent film companies have telephoned
the guild complaining of pressure to reject interim agreements,
union officials said.
   All three networks have vowed to refuse programming produced by
the independents during the strike, now in its 19th week.
   The producers' behavior ``is sad and lacks compassion,'' guild
president George Kirgo said.
   However, Steinberg said, ``The action only diverts attention
from the real issue, which is resolving the strike.''
   The suit was filed as a leading Hollywood figure lamented the
effects of the strike in Tuesday's Hollywood Reporter, an
entertainment industry newspaper.
   ``People are getting hurt,'' Bill Welsh, president of the
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said in an open letter to the WGA
and the alliance.
   Welsh, noting that the strike has forced many companies to shut
down, said: ``We ask you to reconvene your bargaining sessions. We
ask you to go that `extra mile' that will mean a settlement. We ask
you to end a calamity that is becoming a disaster.''
   The producers alliance has said that its last contract offer,
which the WGA rejected by a 3-1 margin June 22, is final.
   The strike has resulted in widespread layoffs.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 40-ton Indian rocket carrying a
research satellite plunged into the sea 4 minutes and 10 seconds
after it was launched today from an island off the eastern coast,
United News of India reported.
   The news agency said the failure apparently was caused by
malfunction of the rocket's first-stage motor.
   Press Trust of India reported an abnormality shortly after the
rocket, the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle, blasted off at 2:28
p.m. from Sriharikota Island, about 1,100 miles southeast of New
Delhi.
   The United News of India said the control center for the launch
first lost contact with the five-stage vehicle about 3 minutes
after lift-off. The report said a signal from the satellite
scheduled for 12 minutes after takeoff was not received.
   M.C. Kapila, an official with Indian Space Research Organization
in New Delhi, said scientists have not yet located the rocket,
believed to have crashed into the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean.
   The chairman of the research organization, U.R. Rao, was quoted
as saying the exact cause of the launch failure had not been
determined.
   The rocket carried a 330-pound satellite designed to photograph
Earth and conduct experiments. The satellite was to enter an orbit
about 240 miles above Earth, scientists said.
   Today's was the second launch failure for India in 15 months.
Another rocket from the same series plunged into the Bay of Bengal
in March 1987, when its first-stage motor also failed to ignite
minutes after launching.
   India last successfully launched a satellite on April 17, 1983.
   Since 1980, it has launched two other satellites, while three
other attempts failed. Six Indian-made satellites have been sent
into orbit by space agencies in the Soviet Union, United States and
Europe.
   On Tuesday, the Soviet Union successfully launched the second of
a pair of space probes on an 111 million-mile odyssey to explore
Mars and help prepare for a manned flight to the red planet.

<TEXT>
   Coney Island's Cyclone roller coaster, 3,000
feet of exhilarating terror for 61 years, has become the city's
newest landmark.
   The Cyclone received landmark status Tuesday by a unanimous vote
of the city Landmarks Preservation Commission. The designation
ensures that future developers would need commission approval
before altering or demolishing the ride.
   The ride is one of only 85 wood-track roller coasters left of
the 1,500 built nationwide.
   The Cyclone, with nine drops and six turns, includes an initial
91-foot plunge. The roller coaster takes more than 100,000 people a
year over 3,000 feet of track at speeds up to 68 mph.
   The timber-and-steel Cyclone was conceived by Harry C. Baker, a
leading operator of amusement park rides, and designed by engineer
Vernon Keenan. The ride cost 25 cents when it opened in 1927; the
cost of one minute and 50 seconds of exhilirating terror is now $3.
   The city's Department of Parks and Recreation leases the ride as
a concession to the Astroland amusement park.
   Henry Stern, parks commissioner, said his 10-year-old son,
Jared, loves the ride. As for himself, Stern readily acknowledged
that ``raw terror'' keeps him from sharing his son's enthusiasm.
   Asked if he had ever been on the Cyclone, the commissioner
responded: ``Not while it was in motion.''

<HEAD>PTL Trustee Says Bakkers Must Limit Visits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL's trustee says he has asked that Jim
and Tammy Bakker curtail their increasingly frequent visits to
Heritage USA.
   ``They're not creating a big disturbance, but it's sort of an
irritant,'' M.C. Benton said Tuesday.
   The trustee said he was told that Tammy Bakker and a member of
the band of the ``PTL Today'' show recently got into an argument in
front of the studio audience minutes after the program ended.
   ``I got a report that she had been particularly abusive,''
Benton said. ``So I just said, `That's enough. I've got enough
other problems without having to worry about them.'''
   Benton said PTL lawyers asked the Bakkers, through the couple's
attorneys, to restrict themselves voluntarily to residential areas
at Heritage USA, the Christian theme park run by the evangelical
empire built by Bakker.
   ``Mr. Bakker's father and mother live there and I didn't want to
shut him out of visiting them,'' said Benton, who was appointed by
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in May to oversee the sale of Heritage USA
property to pay PTL creditors.
   Bakker attorney Jim Toms said Benton had not communicated those
wishes either to him or to Bakker's other lawyer, Ryan Hovis.
   ``I'm astonished to hear such a thing,'' Toms said. ``There
certainly has been no breach of the peace, and when he's the
founder of the ministry and has a substantial constituency there,
I'm astonished that Mr. Benton would prohibit him from going on the
property.
   The Bakkers moved to the Lake Wylie area in June after nearly a
year in exile in Tennessee and California. Bakker resigned from PTL
in 1987 in a sex and money scandal but has been trying ever since
to return.
   In the past month, the Bakkers announced their intentions to buy
Heritage USA and return as its leaders.
   Benton is considering several offers to buy PTL, including one
from Bakker, and is to report his recommendation to Bankruptcy
Judge Rufus Reynolds in August.

<HEAD>Former Hospital Executives Plead Guilty to Income Tax Evasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former executives of a for-profit
hospital have pleaded guilty to taking part in an income tax
evasion scheme in which secret raises and bonuses were disguised as
business expenses.
   G. Francis Craven, 54, and Joel Davids, 44, of the James C.
Giuffre Medical Center falsified records to make more than $40,000
in salary increases look like auto or travel expenses, prosecutors
charged.
   No sentencing date was set because the two are cooperating with
officials as part of their plea agreement. A third former
executive, Frank Haney, 47, also was charged in the scheme.
   Craven was administrator of the financially beleaguered
hospital, Davids was associate administrator and Haney head
controller.
   Craven and Davids pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the
government and to filing false tax returns for the year 1984.
Prosecutors said Craven didn't report nearly $18,500, Davids
$19,800 and Haney $4,000.
   The 228-bed hospital, which provides millions of dollars in
charity care each year to indigent, uninsured patients, has been
under state and federal investigation in recent months because of
its financial and medical practices.
   A state investigation announced in May uncovered 124
deficiencies including 12 questionable patient deaths and 29 cases
of unnecessary surgery.
   In May, the state closed the emergency room for 15 days, banned
admissions for eight days and ordered the naming of a new board of
directors.
   Dr. James C. Giuffre, the hospital's 75-year-old medical
director and namesake, resigned in January after anonymous letters
alleging malpractice and mismanagement were sent to state
authorities and reporters. The letter-writers claimed to be staff
members at the hospital.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today urged Polish
workers to support his social and economic reforms in a speech at a
Baltic port shipyard that was a center of unrest during the birth
of Solidarity.
   Speaking in a huge hall at the Warski shipyard to rows of
stony-faced workers in hard hats and dungarees, the Kremlin leader
emphasized the theme of cooperation between Poland and the Soviet
Union.
   ``It the Soviet and Polish leadership did not feel the support
of the working class, it would not be able to undertake the act of
perestroika (restructuring) and renewal,'' he said.
   ``And one more thing: Without the support of the working class,
these policies would not be worth anything.''
   Overhead, shipyard officials hung a banner reading, ``We are in
solidarity with the Soviet leader.''
   The stop was Gorbachev's main opportunity to address Polish
workers during his six-day Polish visit, which began Monday.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski spoke earlier to the
Warski workers and referred to the ``stormy days'' when Solidarity,
the Soviet bloc's first and only independent labor movement, was
born.
   ``Everything creative and valuable brought along by that period
will be developed,'' he promised. But he said the period ``set
working people at variance. ... It has already become history.''
   In southeastern Poland, 1,600 workers struck two departments of
a steel and defense plant that employs 18,000, opposition activists
said. The government denied any strike was in progress.
   Two months ago, workers at various enterprises throughout the
country went on strike to demand free trade unions and higher
wages, but Warski employees did not join them.
   Solidarity was chartered by Communist authorities in 1980 during
nationwide strikes. The Lenin shipyard in Gdansk is considered the
birthplace of Solidarity, but workers at the Warski complex also
were militant backers of the free trade union federation.
   After months of tension, Solidarity was suspended by the
government in a December 1981 military crackdown and subsequently
outlawed.
   At the Stalowa Wola steel mill 120 miles southeast of Warsaw, a
research department, a tools department and a smithy went on strike
this morning, said Ewa Kaberna, a Solidarity activist in the city.
   Solidarity advisor Jacek Kuron later said the tool department
had returned to work, but the other two departments were still out.
   Workers at the plant had been threatening to strike during
Gorbachev's visit unless seven Solidarity leaders fired after a
strike there April 29-30 are reinstated. Police and plant workers
had a tense standoff at a church in Stalowa Wola on Monday and
Tuesday.
   Government press aide Ryszard Straus denied there was a strike:
``I have just checked. There is no strike at Stalowa Wola.''
   In Krakow on Tuesday, Gorbachev broke precedent for a Soviet
leader by visiting a functioning church.
   His 20-minute tour of the 14th century St. Mary's Roman Catholic
Church on Krakow's Market Square was believed to be the first time
that the head of the officially atheist Soviet Communist Party made
such a visit.
   Six hours before Gorbachev arrived, the square was closed to
anyone who did not have a special pass from their factory or office.
   In April, Gorbachev received at the Kremlin the head of the
Russian Orthodox Church, the first such meeting in at least 40
years.
   Gorbachev, who has introduced programs of restructuring and
reform in certain areas of Soviet society, has promised a new law
on relations between the church and state. In connection with
recent celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of Christianity in
Russia, some churches were allowed to reopen with their confiscated
property returned.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said after
the Krakow tour that it was Gorbachev's first visit to a
functioning church since he became general secretary of the party
in 1985.
   ``I believe Mikhail Gorbachev has visited various churches''
previously, Gerasimov told reporters. ``I believe that he finds in
them a precious piece of art.''
   The Catholic church claims 95 percent of Poland's 37 million
people as members and churches in Poland, including the one visited
by Gorbachev, have traditionally been rallying points for
anti-government demonstrators.
   After the visit, Gorbachev went to a rally attended by about
3,000 invited Polish and Soviet young people and urged them to
return to the teachings of Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the
Soviet Union.
   Speaking in a courtyard at Wawel Castle, the residence of Polish
monarchs until the late 1500s, Gorbachev said Lenin's example could
serve as a model in ``the era of the second world revolution since
the birth of socialism.''
   He urged the people to join the drive for rebuilding communism
and said, ``Do not miss the perestroika (restructuring) train.''
   Also on Tuesday, Gorbachev visited a house in mountains south of
Krakow where Lenin spent several years before World War I.

<HEAD>Campaign Abroad: British Comment on Bentsen</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This is one of a series of periodic reports
compiled by Associated Press bureaus on how the U.S. presidential
election campaign is viewed abroad.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is what two leading British newspapers had to say in
editorials today on Gov. Michael Dukakis' selection of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen as his Democratic running mate in the presidential election:
   _Financial Times (independent): ``Only once in the last 30
years, in 1960, have the Democrats been able to field a `dream
ticket,' one which combined a charismatic northeastern liberal,
John Kennedy, with a wily, experienced Washington insider, the
Texan Lyndon Johnson. That election was in many respects like the
one now under way. A popular ageing Republican president was
retiring, the mood of the country and the balance of power inside
it was shifting, and neither party could command an automatic lien
on public support.
   ``This historical comparison must have weighed on the mind of
Michael Dukakis ... as he contemplated chosing a running mate. . ..
   ``Mr. Bentsen brings indisputable qualifications, if no fire, to
the ticket. Eighteen years a senator, and, never forget, the man
who defeated George Bush to make it to the upper chamber, he has
the Washington experience Mr. Dukakis lacks. ...
   ``The real reason why the lot has fallen on Mr. Bentsen is
because of where he is from. Texas may be a law unto itself but it
is the third largest state of the union, the Democrats must carry
it and the formidable Bensen machine is likely to be more effective
with him on the ticket. ... His mere presence alongside Mr. Dukakis
is explicitly designed to tie Vice President George Bush, a
neo-Texan, down to a part of the country he thought he had in his
pocket and to a state which once rejected him, at the hands of a
man called Bentsen.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of London (independent): ``Mr. Dukakis has reverted
to the tried and tested values of a balanced ticket. ... Mr.
Dukakis may be tainted with Massachusetts liberalism, but Mr.
Bentsen gives the appearance of comfortable Southern conservatism.
   ``Mr. Dukakis is accused of haste and brashness; Mr. Bentsen, at
67, has the solid values of age. While Mr. Dukakis has no
experience of national political office, Mr. Bentsen is a skilled
manipulator of the levers of Washington power. Mr. Dukakis is
`ethnic'; Mr. Bentsen is patrician. ...
   ``It is clear that Mr. Dukakis intends to rely on his running
mate for delivering those Southern Democrats who voted for Mr.
Reagan. To that end his reassuring pro-defense and pro-business
attitudes will help. The fact that he is a self-made millionaire
(from insurance) will not hurt. He has always been a stout defender
of oil interests, and that will stand him in good stead in Oklahoma
and Louisiana, where the oil industry has been badly winded by the
price decline.''

<HEAD>Gun Shop Agrees To Pay $500,000 Settlement In Stockbroker Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A store that sold a .357-caliber pistol less than
an hour before a distraught investor used it to kill a stockbroker
and paralyze another has agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a
negligence suit, a lawyer said.
   Arthur H. Katz, a former Kansas City, Mo., lawyer who lived in
Miami as a protected government witness under the name Arthur Kane,
used the weapon to kill himself after the Oct. 26 shooting at a
Merrill Lynch office here.
   In selling the weapon, the Tamiami Gun Shop violated a Florida
law requiring a cooling-off period between the purchase and pickup
of a gun, the suit contended. Katz bought the weapon 45 minutes
before the shootings.
   The settlement will be divided between the estate of the late
Jose Argilagos, 51, manager at the Merrill Lynch office, and Lloyd
Kolokoff, 39, who was paralyzed from the waist down in the attack.
   ``We're not satisfied, but that's the best we could do,'' George
Vogelsang, a lawyer for Kolokoff, said Tuesday. A separate lawsuit
is pending against Katz's estate and his widow, Vogelsang said.
   Edward Carhart, representing the gun shop, said the store denied
it was negligent or responsible for Katz's actions but decided to
settle instead of risking a larger verdict at trial.
   Katz, 53, became an informant during a 1976 investigation of
insurance fraud in Kansas City.
   The government contended his life was threatened, and he was
placed in the witness protection program in 1977. Katz pleaded
guilty to fraud in 1978 and served six months in a halfway house.
   After being relocated to Miami under a new name, Katz amassed a
huge stock portfolio but lost $10 million to $15 million in the
October crash. He was a clerk with the Social Security
Administration, a job the government had arranged.

<TEXT>
   Rough weather today again kept
disaster specialists from searching for bodies and capping the
burning wells of the Piper Alpha platform, one week after the
world's worst oil rig disaster.
   Police said two more bodies were found Tuesday, bringing to 22
the total recovered.
   Assistants to Red Adair, the 73-year-old Texas oil
troubleshooter, Tuesday night visited the oil and gas platform
where 166 of the 230 men on board died when explosions ripped apart
the structure, according to a spokeswoman for Occidental Petroleum
Corp., the platform's operator.
   But the spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Adair's men were forced to return because of high winds and rough
seas in the area of the platform, 120 miles off Scotland's east
coast.
   Bad weather since Sunday has frustrated Adair's plans to clear
debris from the twisted, tilting platform and to seal three
wellheads still burning.
   Adair's team is based aboard a semi-submersible rig, the Tharos,
stationed alongside the platform, which is approached from a basket
suspended from a crane.
   Occidental said a miniature submarine which has circled the
platform Tuesday sighted what was believed to be the housing module
in which most of the men are thought to have died. But Occidental
officials said that divers cannot begin searching for bodies until
the wells are capped and the structure is strengthened.
   Occidental executives have said they believe a gas leak caused
the disaster.

   Opponents of a planned state prison in the tiny
town of New Braintree have filed suit seeking to force Gov. Michael
Dukakis to divulge documents detailing the prison siting process.
   The suit seeks to force disclosure of 198 documents relating to
the state's decision to locate a new medium-security prison on the
site of a former boarding school in the farming community of New
Braintree.
   ``There isn't anything about the process that has gone
straight,'' New Braintree Selectman Dorothea Vitrac charged at a
news conference after the suit was filed Tuesday in Worcester
Superior Court.
   Prison opponents have raised questions about the propriety of
the siting decision, suggesting that the administration engineered
a deal that could mean millions of dollars in profit for the site's
current landowners, one of whom has contributed to Dukakis
campaigns.
   The FBI is conducting a preliminary inquiry into the matter but
says it is not investigating Dukakis personally.
   The investigation has been a political embarrassment to Dukakis,
the likely Democratic presidential nominee. He has defended the
siting decision, maintaining the targeted documents are covered by
``executive privilege'' and are not public records, as the suit by
prison opponents argues.
   A Norwood, Mass., development firm owned by Daniel Striar and
Gary Jacobson purchased the land from the Seventh-day Adventist
Church in December 1985 for $3 million. The purchase occurred one
month after the state listed the land as a possible prison site.
   Questions surrounding the prison arose when the owners offered
to sell the land to the state for $9.5 million. A state-funded
appraisal of the property in 1986 valued the land at $8.7 million.
   But last week, based on fresh appraisals, the state Division of
Captial Planning and Operations offered to pay $5 million. Striar
and Jacobson immediately rejected the offer, and Dukakis has said
the state will take the land by eminent domain if necessary.
   Dukakis has said that he did not know who owned the land when
the site was picked and that he met Striar only once. Jacobson grew
up in the same neighborhood as Dukakis and has donated to his
campaigns, but both men said they are only casual acquaintenances.

   A state Board of Education committee is
recommending pop-out window exits be required in all new school
buses, a measure prompted by a fiery bus-truck accident near
Carrollton May 14 that killed 27 people.
   The board's finance committee made the recommendation Monday.
   The accident on Interstate 71 occurred when a pickup collided
head-on with a converted school bus.
   The bus burst into flames, and the victims died of smoke
inhalation when they couldn't escape through a rear door _ one of
only two exits on the bus.
   Since then, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson has called for mandatory
inspections of such buses, and questions have arisen about the
safety of buses designed with the fuel tank under the front door _
the other exit on the buses.
   The National Transportation Safety Board will examine the
accident during a three-day hearing next month. NTSB Chairman Jim
Burnett will preside at the hearing set for Aug. 2 in suburban
Louisville, the agency said Tuesday.
   Parties to the hearing are the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration; Ford Motor Co., which manufactured the bus chassis;
Sheller-Globe Corp., which made the bus body, and the state of
Kentucky.

<TEXT>
   Texans took for granted their state's
importance as a 1988 election battleground long before Michael
Dukakis picked Texan Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate.
   But Dukakis' choice on Tuesday of a political partner who can
challenge Republican George Bush on his adopted home turf
guarantees a fight as hot as Texas-style chili.
   Democrats said picking Bentsen was the best kind of Southern
strategy.
   ``Democratic prospects in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana will be
boosted immediately,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a former
Democratic presidential contender.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen helps win Texas,'' echoed New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
   Texas Republicans, naturally, declared that the Democrats won't
carry the state, even with Bentsen on the ticket.
   Bentsen beat Bush in a Senate race 18 years ago. But the
Republicans were quick to dismiss that matchup.
   ``It's important to look again at 1970. Texas has changed,''
said former congressman Tom Loeffler, co-chairman of Bush's Texas
campaign. ``Texas is now a Republican-leaning state.''
   ``I believe Mike Dukakis made a critical mistake in thinking
Texas will bail him out,'' Loeffler said. ``It's a riverboat
gamble, and Michael Dukakis will lose that gamble in a very big
way.''
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements concurred. Now Texans will have a
choice between one of their own for the top job or for No. 2, and
they're likely to go for the big prize, he said.
   ``Given the choice of a Texan president or a Texan vice
president, the people of our state will certainly choose a Texan
president,'' Clements said.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, co-chairman of the Bush campaign in
his state, said flatly that Bentsen ``will not carry Texas for
Dukakis.''
   Some national pollsters said Bentsen gives Dukakis a shot to win
Texas and its 29 electoral votes. But they, too, called it a gamble.
   ``It's a high-risk technique. You've got to beat George Bush in
his home state,'' said Claibourne Darden, an Atlanta-based
pollster. ``If Dukakis can do that, George Bush will be whupped.''
   A statewide poll in Texas in mid-June had Dukakis trailing Bush
by 23 points. But when Bentsen was proposed as Dukakis' running
mate, the Democrats closed to just 5 points.
   Picking Bentsen ``makes Texas a competitive state,'' said Brad
Coker of Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, which did that poll. ``If
there's a drawback, it's that Bentsen doesn't guarantee Texas. That
makes it risky for Dukakis.''
   Jim Oberwetter, who helped run Bush's primary campaign in Texas,
said Bentsen's name on the Democratic ticket wouldn't be a rerun of
the 1960 success of the last ``Boston-Austin'' ticket _ John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
   Oberwetter noted that in 1960, Kennedy and Johnson carried the
state by just over 40,000 votes. ``And that was a Texan who was a
powerhouse,'' he said.
   Still, the Democrats said Dukakis' choice amounted to the best
Southern strategy.

   A ferry boat hit another vessel and
capsized, spilling 26 gamblers and casino workers into the Colorado
River, authorities said.
   At least two dozen people were injured, none seriously, in the
accident Tuesday night, said Janet Smith, a spokeswoman for Mercy
Ambulance.
   The pontoon ferry boat lost power while docking in Bullhead
City, Ariz., and struck an unoccupied pleasure craft, said Las
Vegas Metro Police spokesman Robert Nixon.
   The 25-foot ferry boat operated by Edgewater Casino carries
gamblers and casino workers between Bullhead City on the river's
eastern shore and this gambling resort on the other side, 90 miles
southeast of Las Vegas. The river is about 100 yards wide.
   Eighteen divers and officers from the Nevada Fish and Game
Department helped rescue the passengers, Nixon said.
   Twenty-two were taken to Bullhead Community Hospital and treated
for hypothermia, head and back injuries and shock, said
administrator Joe Harrington. Most were released after treatment.
   Mojave Valley Medical Center also received some passengers but
refused to give details.

   Some of the highest praise of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen's selection as running mate for Democrat Michael S. Dukakis
came from a Republican colleague, but a fellow Texan disputed
Bentsen's impact on the race.
   Dukakis ``couldn't have picked a better man,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, who ran unsuccessfully for his party's
nomination this year. ``It's an excellent choice and I think that
will come from both sides of the aisle.''
   Fellow Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, a Republican, said Bentsen still
will not carry Texas for the Democrats.
   ``I don't think Republicans are going to run against Lloyd
Bentsen,'' Gramm said Tuesday. ``Republicans are going to run
against Michael Dukakis. The distinctions between George Bush and
Michael Dukakis are so clear that Bentsen is not an issue.''
   Gramm, like many other Republicans, passed up opportunities to
criticize Bentsen's record, a record that includes expertise on
taxes, trade, health and welfare.
   Vice President George Bush also claims Texas as home base, and
Gramm said that given a choice between electing a Texan to one of
the nation's two top positions, Texans will choose the presidency
every time.
   Democrats in Congress and elsewhere hailed Bentsen as a moderate
coalition builder who will give the ticket a strong chance in the
South and across the nation.
   Bentsen has the added advantage, they said, of having entered
the Senate in 1970 by beating Bush, then a Texas Republican
congressman.
   ``He knows how to beat George Bush,'' said Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md. ``He did just that in 1970.''
   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, the 1984 Democratic
presidential nominee, said Dukakis made a ``superb choice.''
   ``Senator Bentsen is regarded as one of the nation's top experts
in financial and economic affairs and is one of the most thoughtful
minds in international security and defense matters,'' Mondale said
Tuesday.
   ``More than that, he has been a source of good sense, moderation
and decency throughout his years of public life,'' he said. ``He
will make an excellent vice president and Governor Dukakis deserves
a straight A on his first choice.''
   Said Paul Simon, D-Ill, a former Democratic presidential
candidate: ``Democratic prospects in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana
will be boosted immediately, and when the American people get to
know Lloyd Bentsen, it will strengthen the ticket everywhere.
   ``More important than anything else, if there should be a
tragedy, Lloyd Bentsen would make a superb president.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who had been on Dukakis' short list of
prospective running mates, said he heard of the choice with ``some
regrets at not being selected.''
   ``Disappointed would be overstating it,'' said Glenn.
   Responding to questions, Glenn said Jesse Jackson has made a
valuable contribution to American politics, assuring that no black
person will ever again be ruled out of presidential politics merely
because of his race.
   But some of Jackson's supporters described the choice as a
``slap in the face.''
   ``It's safe to say there are many, many people in this country
who are enthusiastic supporters of Jesse Jackson who will look with
disfavor and pain at this nomination,'' said Rep. Ronald Dellums,
D-Calif.
   Dellums said choosing Bentsen creates the impression that
Dukakis either walked away from Jackson and his backers or chose to
ignore ``the issue of race.''
   But other Democrats disagreed.
   ``I think on the issues of the big constituencies Lloyd Bentsen
has been right: right on civil rights, right on womens' issues ...
He is acceptable to blacks and business and that's the key,'' said
Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.. ``You've got to build a coalition
broad enough to get elected and Lloyd Bentsen will help to do
that.''
   Union activists also praised Bentsen, saying he has recently
shored up a relatively poor labor record with his deft handling of
legislation on trade and mandatory notice of plant closings and
massive layoffs.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the choice gives the
nation the same ``Massachusetts-Texas combination'' that carried
President John F. Kennedy to victory in 1960 after his selection of
Texan Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate.

   A 9-year-old trapped for 20 hours in the
rubble of a collapsed department store is in critical condition
with kidney problems, doctors said.
   Physicians at the University of Texas Medical Branch said that
toxins from dead muscle tissue apparently destroyed Jorge Mena's
ability to cleanse his blood and that the boy from Merida, Mexico,
may lose use of his kideys.
   The Amigo Store in Brownsville collapsed during heavy rain
Friday, killing 14 people and injuring at least 47. Investigators
have not determined the cause.
   ``He complains the whole time he is in the (hyperbaric)
chamber,'' said Dr. John Mader, who is overseeing the boy's
high-pressure oxygen treatments. ``But that's good because he's a
fighter, and that is what it takes.''
   Jorge's mother remained hospitalized in Brownsville, and a
15-year-old sister died in the accident, authorities said.

   Ousted Panamanian President Arturo Delvalle has
flown here for a routine heart checkup but is expected to go back
in a few days to ``return Panama to democracy,'' said the nation's
ambassador to the United States.
   Delvalle had heart bypass surgery about 10 years ago and is
supposed to have a checkup every six months, Ambassador Juan Sosa
said in Washington on Tuesday.
   He said the president is not hospitalized and was being tested
by his private physician at an undisclosed location.
   The U.S. government recognizes Delvalle as his nation's chief of
state despite his February removal by Panama's military ruler, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Delvalle has been in hiding in Panama with the help of the
United States since Noriega replaced him with Manuel Solis Palma.
   Delvalle arrived secretly on Sunday, according to Panama's Miami
Consul Roberto Dominguez. For security reasons, officials would not
say how or when Delvalle was leaving.
   In Panama, the pro-government La Republica newspaper said
Delvalle suffered a minor heart attack Monday and flew abroad for
treatment.

   Police today foiled an attempt to
steal about $75,000 worth of goods from a U.S. military truck en
route to the U.S-run Clark Air Base, the Philippine News Agency
said.
   The state-run agency quoted police as saying three U.S.
Commissary trucks have been robbed since January.
   Maj. Efren Alamares, who led the police raid, said officers
received an intelligence report about the plan and set up a
surveillance team on a highway leading to Angeles City, about 50
miles north of Manila, where Clark is located.
   The truck drove from Subic Bay Naval Base, about 35 miles
southwest of Angeles.
   But about 12 miles before reaching Angeles, the truck left the
highway and entered a private compound where the goods were
supposed to be transferred to a waiting truck, police said.
   Officers moved in and arrested the truck driver. The rest of the
would-be thieves escaped, they said.
   The truck carried American cigarettes, canned goods and other
groceries.

   A group of Israeli reserve soldiers who refuse
to serve in the occupied territories today accused the government
of harassing them with security checks and urged the attorney
general to drop an inquiry into their activities.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, whose office
oversees the Shin Bet security service, said he could not respond
to the charges of unusual security checks and mail tampering. But
he said the conscientious objectors were engaged in clearly illegal
activity.
   ``There are democratic ways in Israel to express one's opinion,
and engage in political struggle,'' said the spokesman, Avi Pazner.
``The problem with these people is they think they can be their own
judges and do whatever they like.''
   About 600 soldiers who refuse to serve in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip belong to a group calling itself Yesh Gvul, Hebrew
for ``There is a Limit.'' Twenty-nine have been jailed on charges
of disobeying orders.
   The latest to be sentenced was Capt. Nissim Kedem, 33, a member
of a tank division who today was ordered to serve a 21-day term,
Yesh Gvul spokesman Ronen Shamir said.
   Attorney General Yosef Harish has ordered a police inquiry into
whether Yesh Gvul members are guilty of incitement for encouraging
reserve soldiers to refuse orders to serve in the territories.
   Yesh Gvul spokesman Shamir said tactics used against his group
included a rigorous security check of a group member returning to
Israel from abroad and a case where 20 letters the group mailed to
other countries were returned with the envelopes opened.
   ``This indicates there is a storehouse of data on members of the
group that marks them as posing a danger to the country,'' Shamir
said.
   Also today, Israeli troops dynamited the homes of two
Palestinians suspected of hurling firebombs at military patrols in
the occupied West Bank. The sound of the explosions was broadcast
on Israel army radio.
   The predawn demolitions were in the villages of Ras Karkar and
Janyeh near Ramallah, north of Jerusalem. An army spokesman said
the homes belonged to suspects in a June 9 firebombing in which two
army officers were badly burned.
   The home of a fourth suspect in the firebombing was sealed, the
army said.
   Three other homes in Atil, near the northern West Bank city of
Tulkarem, also were sealed shut, the army said, adding that the
homes belonged to Palestinians suspected of burning and stoning
buses in April.
   The army recently has issued troops with new fireproof suits
because of the frequency of firebomb attacks in the occupied
territories, army radio said.

   The leadership of Azerbaijan annulled
Nagorno-Karabakh's decision to secede from the republic and accused
officials in the disputed region of breaking the law and defying
higher authorities, Tass said today.
   The official news agency said the Presidium, or executive
committee, of Azerbaijan's parliament met Tuesday night, a few
hours after the secession declaration by Nagorno-Karabakh's
legislature.
   The legislature ``failed to secure strict compliance with
principles of legality'' and ``openly encroached on the
national-state composition of the republic,'' Tass quoted the
Azerbaijan Presidium as saying in a resolution.
   Tass said the Presidium proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh's
declaration of secession ``null and void and revoked it.''
   Armenians have been pressing for five months for
Nagorno-Karabakh to be annexed to the republic of Armenia.
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region of 160,000 people, is mainly
Armenian.
   The campaign has brought Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenians into
direct confrontation with central authorities in Moscow and with
Azerbaijani authorities, who oppose any change in the territorial
status of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In February, the ethnic tension led to riots in the Azerbaijan
city of Sumgait. At least 32 people were killed.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's declaration of secession was the first such
action in the 70 years of Soviet history. It immediately raised
constitutional and legal questions. Dissident historian Roy
Medvedev told The Associated Press the action was clearly
unconstitutional and illegal.
   The Soviet Constitution gives citizens the right to
self-determination, but it requires a republic's consent for any
proposed changes in its boundaries. Nagorno-Karabakh has been an
autonomous region of mostly Moslem Azerbaijan since 1923, even
though more than three-quarters of its residents are ethnic
Armenians, who are predominantly Christian. Armenians consider
Nagorno-Karabakh to be part of their ancestral homeland.
   On Feb. 20, Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature asked the Azerbaijani
and Armenian governments to approve transfer to Armenia. Armenia's
legislature agreed June 15, but Azerbaijan's said no two days later.
   The Nagorno-Karabakh legislature announced Tuesday the area was
being renamed the Artsakh Autonomous Region of Armenia.
   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia have been striking and
holding street rallies sporadically since February. Today, Tass
said the Nagorno-Karabakh legislature had asked residents to return
to work, but that in the region's main city, Stepanakert, ``all
industrial enterprises in the city remained idle on July 13, public
and city transport did not function, all shops selling manufactured
goods were closed, so were consumer service outlets.''
   A worker at the Stepanakert radio station said the city was
suffering as a result of the strike.
   ``The food situation has become very critical,'' said the worker
in a telephone interview. He refused to be identified. ``We are
producing our own bread and milk, but other foodstuffs are lacking.
Nothing is coming to us from Azerbaijan.''
   He said troops were deployed on city streets and in other parts
of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, a reporter for the republic's
official news agency said the dispute was being resolved according
to the new policies of Soviet Communist Party general secretary
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It's being decided in a democratic way. Some people say one
thing; others say something else,'' the reporter said in a
telephone interview. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gorbachev has said more attention should be paid to the concerns
of the Soviet Union's more than 100 national groups but that some
are abusing the new openness of society.

   Legislation expanding the discretion of
judges in cases involving elderly and minor guardianships awaits
action by Gov. Henry Bellmon.
   The Legislature passed the bill Tuesday as it wrapped up the
1988 session.
   The measure would give judges more discretion in determining
which wards need full-time guardians. It also brings into one
statute all laws on guardianship.
   Rep. Don McCorkell said judges, lawyers and advocates for the
elderly had worked to develop a compromise that was fair to
guardians and protected the rights of wards. Opponents in the House
argued the bill was too complex and cumbersome.
   Oklahoma's guardianship laws have not been substantially changed
since the 1950s.
   An Associated Press series examined guardianship laws nationwide
in 1987 and found a network of overburdened courts that routinely
fail to monitor wards under their jurisdiction.

   Jerry Costello won a special Democratic
primary and will face Republican Robert Gaffner in August for the
right to serve out the remaining months of the late Melvin Price's
term in Congress.
   Costello, chairman of the St. Clair County Board, on Tuesday
overwhelmed East St. Louis Alderman Clarence Ellis Sr., 18,259
votes to 2,062 in unofficial returns. Gaffner, who faced no
opposition in the primary, got 5,155 votes.
   Price, a Democrat, died of cancer April 22. He was 83 and had
already announced he would not seek re-election after 44 years in
Congress.
   In March, Costello and Gaffner won their respective regular
primaries in the race to succeed Price; they will face each other
in the general election in November. Price's term ends in January.

<HEAD>Farmer Blasts Into Lake To Irrigate Bean Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAPEER, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A farmer who dynamited his way into a
private lake to get water for his bean crop said today he has
stopped pumping from the lake.
   Gary Bulzan said he turned off the pump Tuesday, shortly before
a judge barred him from taking water from Lake Pleasant. The
pumping angered many of the 200 families who own homes around the
lake, 50 miles north of Detroit.
   Bulzan blasted a hole last week near the 130-acre lake, allowed
the crater to fill and began pumping water to a sprinkler that
sprayed his adjacent 75-acre field.
   Sgt. Tim Burke of the Department of Natural Resources said
Bulzan failed to apply for a permit to pump the water but probably
would have received one if he had.
   Dorothy Nadrowski, whose home overlooks the lake, said the pump
ran constantly for three days. One neighbor said the lake dropped
more than an inch since the pumping began.
   Bulzan's attorney, Emory Clark, said the farmer was just trying
to save his crop from the drought.
   ``If the water is up to your bellybutton now and it goes down an
inch, I can't see where that matters more than a farmer who is
paying $100 an acre to farm the land and stands to lose his whole
crop,'' Clark said.

<TEXT>
   Zubin Mehta, the conductor of the New
York and Israeli philharmonic orchestras, said today he has
appealed to Soviet officials to release a woman denied permission
to immigrate to Israel for 14 years.
   Mehta told reporters he met the woman, Elena Keiss-Kuna of
Leningrad, during a recent tour of the Soviet Union with the New
York Philharmonic.
   He said he also asked Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
oil magnate Armand Hammer to intervene on Mrs. Keiss-Kuna's behalf.
``If anyone can gain her release, those two people can,'' Mehta
said at a news conference.
   Mrs. Keiss-Kuna's sister, Anna Rosnovsky, immigrated to Israel
14 years ago and is a violinist in the Israeli Philharmonic
Orchestra. Soviet authorities denied Mrs. Keiss-Kuna an exit visa
at the time, contending her job as a chemical engineer gave her
access to state secrets.
   ``When I spoke to Soviet officials, I told them the only state
secrets this woman knows is the recipe for borscht,'' Mehta said.

<TEXT>
   Jane's Defense Weekly today published a clearly
detailed satellite photograph which it said shows the headquarters
of the Soviet Northern Fleet at Severomorsk, in the northwestern
Soviet Union near northern Finland.
   The photograph in the respected military affairs weekly shows
the main docking area for Kiev class aircraft carriers and battle
cruisers as well as the naval aviation airfield at Severomorsk,
which lies on the Kola peninsula near Murmansk.
   Jane's said Severomorsk is the largest of nine main Northern
Fleet surface vessel bases, but is only ``a small fraction of the
massive Soviet military presence on the Kola,'' making the
peninsula ``home for the densest gathering of military
installations in the world.''
   It said the photo was taken by the French SPOT satellite and
enhanced by computer techniques. It did not say how it obtained the
photograph, or on what date it was taken.
   The photo clearly shows an aircraft carrier-sized vessel docked
in the bay, and smaller warships berthed perpendicular to the
coastline.
   Inland, a 4,000-yard landing strip is visible, surrounded by
what Jane's described as a ``characteristic configuration of
hardened aircraft shelters around the base.''

   Chippendales nightclub, with its all-male
dance revue for women, has been packing 'em in. So much so that the
Fire Department has ordered it closed next month for repeated
instances of overcrowding.
   The department notified Chippendales Tuesday that it has revoked
the establishment's fire permit and given it until Aug. 4 to close
because of ``repeated and flagrant disregard of the fire code,''
said Battalion Chief Dean Cathey.
   ``We're not talking about five to 10 people,'' Cathey said. The
club has a capacity of 299, but as many as 576 people have been
jammed inside, he said.
   Over the past five years, Chippendales has been cited 14 times
for overcrowding and has received fines totaling $14,300 and
probation adding up of 36 months, Cathey said.
   Manager Steve Banerjee said his club is being targeted because
of the nature of its entertainment, which features gyrating,
scantily-clad men. He said he has hired attorney Melvin Belli to
sue the Fire Department.
   ``I'm sure if we provided entertainment for men, we wouldn't be
having this trouble,'' he said.
   Cathey denied any bias. ``If they're not breaking the law, they
won't be cited,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors today unsealed an indictment
charging seven people, including the brother of Contra leader
Adolfo Calero, with illegally supplying mercenaries and weapons to
the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The long-awaited indictment did not mention any Reagan
administration officials or Calero himself.
   Mario Calero was accused of recruiting and paying for
mercenaries with the help of a Texas millionaire, Maco Stewart, and
anti-Communist Cuban activists from the Miami area. Adolfo Calero's
brother is based in New Orleans.
   Also among those indicted were Thomas Posey, head of
Alabama-based Civilian Materiel Assistance, and Jack Terrell, a
former mercenary who later blew the whistle on the alleged illegal
operation.
   All seven are accused of violating the U.S. Neutrality Act,
which bars hostile actions against foreign governments from U.S.
soil.
   ``According to the indictment, defendants recruited soldiers in
the United States to participate in military expeditions and
enterprises against the government of Nicaragua,'' a statement from
the U.S. Attorney's office said.
   The indictment mentions two groups totaling 19 soldiers
recruited in early 1985, with money provided from Stewart to Mario
Calero. It gave no details on who the soldiers were.
   In one case cited from 1985, Terrell is accused of ordering his
soldiers to help Contra rebels destroy a bridge at Sinsin,
Nicaragua.
   The indictment refers to ``others known and unknown to the grand
jury'' but does not list the conspirators.
   Interim U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen withdrew from the case
because he had represented retired Maj. Gen. John Singlaub while in
private practice.
   Lehtinen emphasized that his former client, a leader in private
efforts to raise aid for Contras, wasn't directly involved in the
case.
   The prosecutor today refused to answer questions about any
possible involvement by administration officials in the alleged
scheme.
   Terrell and Joe Adams, a former bodyguard of Adolfo Calero,
could face up to 33 years in prison on Neutrality Act violations
and charges they transported firearms without a license.
   Jose Coutin, an anti-Communist Cuban activist and gun store
owner, faces 13 years on Neutrality Act violations and allowing
someone to use his passport.
   Posey, Calero and Stewart face up to eight years each in prison,
according to the U.S. Attorney's office. Alex Martinez, an
anti-Castro Miami Cuban and account executive, was also charged
with violating the Neutrality Act.
   Posey and Calero were the first to turn themselves in this
morning before a U.S. magistrate in Fort Lauderdale. The other
defendants also made arrangements to surrender today, except for
Joe Adams, who will surrender later, the U.S. attorney's office
said.
   ``I have not broken any laws,'' Mario Calero said Tuesday night
at his brother's house. ``This is ironic and astonishing. It must
be a misunderstanding and I know it will be cleared up.''
   Terrell, who now opposes the anti-Sandinista rebels, said
earlier he will turn his arms-smuggling trial into a forum on the
Reagan adminstration's policy in Nicaragua. He and others say they
were encouraged by the Reagan administration in their efforts.
   ``I will subpoena government officials at the highest level,''
said Terrell. ``I will put the Contra policy on trial.''
   Terrell said it is unfair that he and other low-level smugglers
were being indicted while those who ordered the weapons are free.
   ``I have some news for this administration,'' he said. ``I won't
take the fall for Rob Owen, Ollie North or Ronald Reagan.'' Owen
was North's aide and liaison to the Contra operations.
   Terrell was investigated by the FBI on North's orders when
Terrell began talking about Contra supply operations.
   Terrell said the indictments were returned only because Congress
got wind that Miami's then-U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner was trying to
stop the investigation at the behest of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   Congress investigated charges that the probe was sidetracked but
did not reach any conclusion. Kellner, who resigned last month, has
strongly denied slowing the investigation.
   Terrell, who most recently worked for a liberal policy group in
Washington, became a vocal opponent of U.S. policy in Central
America.
   Until he changed his mind on Contra aid, Terrell helped Civilian
Materiel Assistance in its efforts to aid the rebels. He reported
participating in meetings with Owen and Contra leader Adolfo
Calero, among others, to plan supply and other operations.
   The arms shipment that sparked the investigation was flown out
of Fort Lauderdale in March 1985 after Contra supporters gathered
20mm cannons, M-60 machine guns, mortar shells, automatic rifles
and ammunition at various points around Miami.
   Steven Carr, a CMA member who later died of an apparent drug
overdose in California, told The Associated Press that the plane
landed at Ilopango Air Force Base in El Salvador. The arms were
stored there for several weeks, he said, then sent to Contra troops
in northern Costa Rica.

   Two bombs blasted through a
British army barracks early today, tearing off part of the roof and
injuring nine soldiers. The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility.
   Police said the bombs were placed side by side near an outside
wall of the soldiers' living quarters and tore a 3-by-6-foot hole
in it.
   Police originally said the blast was caused by only one bomb,
but later announced two bombs had gone off.
   At about the time of the explosion, shots were fired from a
passing automobile at a police car in the same area, but no one was
injured, police said. They said the passing automobile had Dutch
license plates.
   In Dublin, the IRA said in a statement circulated to the media
that it carried out ``the bomb attack in West Germany against crown
forces.'' It did not elaborate.
   The IRA, which is waging a guerrilla campaign to drive the
British out of Northern Ireland, recently has stepped up attacks on
British targets on the European continent.
   A police statement said the bombs went off at about 3 a.m. at
the Glamorgan Barracks in Duisburg, about 30 miles north of Cologne.
   The building, which British army officials say houses about 100
soldiers, is in a residential section of Duisburg.
   ``Innocent sleeping soldiers were the targets. This avoids the
risk of confronting people who are awake,'' said a spokesman for
the British army in West Germany who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Maj. John Wilkinson, another British army spokesman, said,
``Nine were hurt, but none were hospitalized and all were treated
at the scene.''
   After the blast, a hole was found in a security fence protecting
the barracks, said Duisburg police spokesman Reinhard Pape.
   ``We suspect they cut a hole in the fence to get to the
barracks,'' Pape said, adding that police did not know whether
there was a connection between the bomb blast and the shooting.
   Assailants fired a machine pistol or an automatic weapon at the
police car but no one was injured, he said.
   He said police were searching for a yellow BMW with Dutch
license plates in connection with the shooting.
   The soldiers targeted in the bomb attack belong to the 35th
Squadron of the Royal Corps Transport, a part of the 3rd Armored
Division Transport Regiment, said Maj. John Wilkinson, another
spokesman for the British army at Moenchengladbach.
   ``This is a small barracks, and not a major facility,''
Wilkinson said.
   About 56,000 British soldiers are stationed in West Germany.
   The mainly Catholic IRA seeks to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the Irish Republic.
   On March 6 in Gibraltar, British commandos killed three unarmed
IRA guerrillas.
   IRA terrorists on May 1 killed three British airmen in the
Netherlands in two separate attacks.
   Two days later, a car bomb was found at a British military base
in the central West German city of Bielefeld. The car bomb was
disposed of before it could explode.
   A March 1987 bombing of the British Army of the Rhine
headquarters in the West German city of Rheindahlen was the first
IRA attack in continental Europe in about a decade. That blast
injured 31 people.
   Tuesday was the anniversary of the 1690 Battle of Boyne, in
which Protestant King William III defeated Catholic King James II.
   Throughout the British province on Tuesday, thousands of
Protestant loyalists marched to celebrate the victory.

   Echoes of the turbulence of the 1960s followed
Tom Hayden when he returned to his home state to promote a new book.
   Hayden, 48, who was born in the suburb of Royal Oak and attended
the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, faced familiar hostility
Tuesday while discussing his book, ``Reunion.''
   Callers to a Detroit radio talk show criticized Hayden and his
wife, Jane Fonda, for their anti-Vietnam War activities. More of
the same came from about a dozen veterans who protested outside a
hall in Warren where Hayden appeared.
   Hayden said his home state figured prominently in his book. He
and other activists founded Students for a Democratic Society in
1962 in Port Huron, Mich.
   The book also describes the end of 14 years of estrangement from
his father, Jack Hayden, who died the night Hayden was elected to
the California Assembly in 1982, Hayden said. Hayden's mother died
in 1986.
   ``As best I can sort it out, I wrote the book first out of
compulsion to find out something about myself and my parents,''
Hayden said.

   A helicopter with 21 people aboard
ditched into the North Sea today, and two helicopters and a
lifeboat rescued all the occupants, the coast guard said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   The coast guard in Aberdeen said the Sikorsky helicopter made a
controlled landing onto the ocean surface 17 miles east of Lerwick
in the Shetland Islands.
   Most helicopter traffic in the area serves the oil rigs of the
North Sea, but it was not immediately known whether this one was
ferrying oil workers.
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, said the helicopter
landed upright and stayed afloat with the occupants remaining
inside, but it said weather conditions were rough.
   The coast guard said it sent a helicopter from Sumburgh in the
Shetlands to mount a rescue operation, along with a Shell Oil Co.
helicopter and a lifeboat from Lerwick.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   
   July 8
   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on the shooting down of
an Iranian airliner:
   The investigation into (the) destruction of an Iranian airliner
seems headed toward two conclusions. One is that there was no
deliberate provocation on the part of the Iranian government. Iran
Air Flight 655 was within a recognized commercial flight corridor
when it was shot down by the USS Vincennes. ...
   The second conclusion is that Capt. William C. Rogers apparently
acted responsibly when he loosed two anti-aircraft missiles against
the approaching jet. Like other U.S. commanders in the Persian
Gulf, Rogers was under orders not to risk the kind of air attack
that killed 37 sailors aboard the USS Stark last year. ...
   The two conclusions lead inescapably to a third. If neither the
pilot nor the skipper was at fault in the tragedy, then the fault
must lie with the decisions in Washington, D.C., that placed both
the Vincennes and the airliner at such extreme and unavoidable risk.
   This disaster exposes the flaws of America's Persian Gulf
policy. In theory, the U.S. Navy is acting as a neutral protector
of international shipping threatened by the war between Iran and
Iraq. ...
   Constantly under threat, these warships are confined to a narrow
body of water that provides little advance warning of approaching
jets. They have weapons that can destroy a plane long before it can
be positively identified. Their nervous crews must instantly
distinguish the occasional hit-and-run attack from the constant
traffic of civilian ships and aircraft. ...
   It's time to rethink the whole policy, before this risky naval
posture becomes institutionalized.

   Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal on the suggestion to divert water
from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi:
   A proposal by a group of Southern senators to increase the
discharge from the Great Lakes to assist navigation on the
Mississippi River is reasonable. A 100-day increase in water
release would lower the level of lakes Huron and Michigan by about
an inch and increase the river level by about a foot at St. Louis
and six inches at Memphis.
   The increased flow would greatly ease the barge traffic on the
Mississippi, save thousands of hours of work in dredging channels
in the river and lower the cost of transporting the nation's grain
crops to ports on the Gulf of Mexico.

   Central Maine Morning Sentinel, Waterville, Maine, on closing
unneeded military bases:
   If you believe there's waste in the Defense budget, don't blame
it all on the generals and the admirals or even the defense
contract influence peddlers.
   As Walt Kelly's Pogo might have put it, the villain may be us.
   The Pentagon could save millions by closing down obsolete bases,
but every time it tries it is blocked by Congress which fears the
anger of voters in districts where bases are located. ...
   That's why the closings can be accomplished only by the adoption
of a politically neutral plan such as that proposed by Rep. Dick
Armey, a Texas Republican. It would protect members from angry
constituents by setting up a bipartisan commission to recommend
which bases should be closed. The Secretary of Defense would be
authorized to close all or none. He couldn't pick and choose. That
way there would be no room for political favoritism. The whole plan
would have to play out between election day in November and
inauguration day in January, thus taking the issue as far as
possible out of politics. ...

   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on the closing military bases:
   Congress has once again avoided one of the more sensitive issues
it has had to face _ closing military bases the Pentagon says are
obsolete.
   Late last week, the House tossed around the issue during a
four-hour debate. All the members could agree on was to postpone
any final decision.
   Difficult or not, it's impossible to talk about cutting defense
spending without talking about cutting back somewhere.
   The United States faces the largest debt in its history. It just
seems to make sense to cut back in areas like the bases that have
outlived their usefulness.
   In the long run, closing installations that no longer serve any
purpose may be a positive step toward cutting defense spending at a
point where it will do the least harm to our national security.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on the state district judge
protesting what he called prejudice in the judicial system:
   Alberto Miera presents a truly troubling stain on Minnesota's
landscape.
   Miera is the suspended Ramsey County District Court judge who
last week called an end to a hunger strike he said was intended to
raise public awareness of unequal treatment accorded by the state's
judiciary to ``socially vulnerable'' minorities such as himself.
   Miera is a 37-year-old Hispanic-American and self-professed
bisexual. He had been convicted of sexual harassment for forcibly
kissing a male court clerk. The state Supreme Court voted to
suspend Miera for one year without pay rather than remove him from
the bench.
   We are, we admit, suspicious of Miera. After all, his plaints of
racial bias were not raised until after he had been found guilty on
the harassment charge. And he has offered no specific incidents of
alleged bias agaist anyone other than himself. It seems he has
sought to shift the focus of his protest from his deeds to some
vague societal misdeeds.
   Yet, repeated claims of racial and sexual bias are serious and
disturbing. They are particularly so here in Minnesota, where we
pride ourselves and our state on our liberal attitudes and
equitable legal standards for all our citizens. ...

   The Miami Herald on the impeachment proceedings against U.S.
District Court Judge Alcee Hastings:
   Alcee Hastings worked long and hard to serve his community and,
especially, the cause of black equality in that community. If he
wants to serve his community further rather than divide it, and
advance equality rather than retard it, U.S. District Judge
Hastings should resign. His only remaining defense is that a black
judge need not meet the same high standard as other federal judges.
That defense makes a mockery of Judge Hastings' long and
distinguished civil-rights career. ...
   Judge Hastings can expect a trial in the Senate that could
remove him. At best, that trial would leave him on the bench, but
utterly bereft of the trust of prosecutors, defense attorneys and
fellow jurists and fellow attorneys _ trust a judge must have to
operate effectively.
   Alcee Hastings has too much intelligence, wit, and charisma to
waste it in such a hollow role. The community has other, more
constructive, work for a man of his abilities.

General Edwin Meese:
   Claiming vindication is Meese's clumsy way to save face as he,
at the same time, gives in to pressure from fellow conservatives
and from Vice President George Bush that he resign.
   Like-minded right-wingers lost patience with Meese back when it
became clear that his legal problems were making it impossible for
him to be an effective leader on issues dear to the right's heart,
such as taking away women's right to abortion or getting ideologues
onto the Supreme Court. ...

   The Journal, Providence, R.I., on the shortage of tuba players:
   We possess no statistics to bolster our impression, but the word
is out that America will soon be suffering from a serious shortage
of tuba players. ...
   The present situation is said to be influenced by a perceived
decline in musical training among the young, as well as the cost of
the instrument _ which is measured in the thousands of dollars.
   ....Another obvious factor is sound. The tuba sounds very much
as it looks, which is not especially elegant.... What the tuba does
do well, however, is furnish a full-bodied sound to a band or
orchestra _ a sound without which many major works are rendered
simply shadows of themselves.
   If tuba lovers want to demonstrate the importance of the
survival of their instrument, they need only play a Sousa march _
first without, then with, the endangered tuba. The difference is
astounding.

   The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on the resignation of Attorney
General Meese:
   The last crony is leaving. Months, even years after propriety
demanded it, Ed Meese says he'll resign _ sometime.
   Whatever conservative legacy he left the Justice Department and
the courts is overshadowed by his cheapening of the office of
attorney general and the chaos now paralyzing Justice. ...
   Meese has managed to slip through the net in four
investigations, because the evidence against him always was
circumstantial. It just happened that cronies who did favors for
Meese soon ended up with lucrative government contracts, or federal
jobs or other special favors.
   The best Meese's investigators could find was impropriety, not
illegality. Yet the attorney general took the lack of charges as a
ringing endorsement of his innocence. ...
   Meese is a deal-maker, a hustler. He never understood that the
attorney general can't use his office to create a personal pork
barrel. ...
   Does Meese leave any legacy except sleaze? ...
   He tried to weaken the Miranda Rule and abortion rights before a
Supreme Court that was prepared to do neither. He embarked on an
anti-pornography crusade, an odd priority for someone whose mission
also includes fighting organized crime. He botched the early stages
of the Iran-Contra probe, perhaps deliberately.
   Yet, Meese has shown one thing. An attorney general's politics
are not as important as his credibility, his honesty and his
ability to lead. After three years with a laughingstock for a
leader, Justice needs an attorney general of high personal
reputation. But the department must wait for the next
administration to provide one.

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on the resignation of Attorney
General Meese III:
   The remarks by outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese III prove
once again that he and others in the Reagan administration have
completely missed the point.
   Meese announced his resigtation ..., not in Washington but at a
news conference on the West Coast. That followed the filing of an
830-page report from Indpendent Counsel James McKay which will
apparently not bring any indictments against the 56-year-old Meese.
   That, says the nation's highest law enforcement officer, is a
vindication that will allow him to leave office with allegations of
wrongdoing behind him.
   Baloney. This is the same idiotic assertion we've heard all
along, that it somehow would be morally wrong to quit the office
until justice had run its course. ...
   By staying as long as he did, Meese placed himself above the
interests of the agency he managed and above the interests of
national law enforcement.
   His departure is great news for the nation, which at least now
has the chance to get a fully functional Justice Department. That
wasn't going to happen with Ed Meese aboard.

   John Zaccaro Jr., the son of former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferrarro, was surprised when he was sentenced to four
months for selling cocaine.
   However, and obviously to the surprise of no one, Zaccaro gained
approval to serve his sentence under house arrest. And, hardly a

   It's obvious that who you know or who you are remain deciding

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on the federal proposal
for notice of plant closings:
   Polls show that most Americans favor laws requiring companies to
give advance notice before they close plants _ such as the bill
passed by Congress but vetoed by President Reagan.
   Those Americans should consider what one executive calls ``the
industry with the most elaborate federally imposed
advance-notification requirements:'' the railroads.
   Under the Interstate Commerce Act, a railroad has to inform
union officials months before it closes a line, get their consent
to an ``implementing agreement'' and guarantee generous severance
payments to any employees laid off.
   But from 1947 to the present, railroad employment has dropped
from 1.3 million to 230,000. During that same period, total U.S.
employment has soared.
   One can hardly ask for a clearer demonstration: It is not
government regulation that keeps workers on the job, but vigorous
competition in the private sector.

   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on congressional pay raises:
   How much is your congressman or senator worth? Opinions vary,
but each year Congress has a battle over whether to raise its
salary.
   Recently the House voted a 4 percent increase for federal
employees but exempted members of Congress and other top officials.
   Now Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., has come up with a plan that
seems daffy but could be valuable. Members of Congress would be
able to choose a salary between the current $89,500 and the
$135,000 last recommended by the federal pay commission, but could
not keep any honoraria for speeches to trade associations and other
groups.
   Voters would decide in the next election whether the congressman
is worth it. Rep. Rostenkowski thinks the plan would eliminate much
of the hypocrisy that accompanies the annual debate over salaries,
especially when votes are called on pay increases.
   Some congressmen are underpaid and others are overpaid. The
Rostenkowski plan would let members judge the value of their
service and then, a few months thereafter, allow constituents to
cast the judgment that really counts. Makes sense to us.

   Colored People when the Massachusetts governor and the Texas
senator entered the crowded ballroom.
   It was in marked contrast to the rousing scene Tuesday night
when Jackson addressed the same group.
   In fact, the first burst of enthusiasm from the audience came as
NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks, who introduced Dukakis,
turned to the governor and said, ``You know, knowing Jesse has been
good for you.''
   The audience applauded, and Dukakis smiled.
   In his speech, Dukakis promised that as president his ``door is
going to be open.''
   Then he went on, ``I've learned a lot from Jesse and I've
learned a lot from you.''
   Bentsen followed Dukakis to the podium and said, ``There can be
no question where a Dukakis-Bentsen administration would stand on
the important civil rights issues of the day.''
   ``Mike Dukakis and I are committed to making a difference for
America,'' Bentsen said.
   But, once again, the loudest applause came during Hooks'
introduction of the senator when he referred to Jackson. Hooks
looked at Bentsen and said he had ``a tough act to follow. ... Many
of our delegates, as you know, wanted to see Jesse in this
position.''
   At that point delegates stood and cheered and applauded.
   ``I sympathize with you,'' said Hooks.
   Before Dukakis entered the room, Hooks told delegates to tear up
hand-lettered signs many were carrying that read, ``Jesse is
qualified'' and ``What's wrong with Jesse?''
   ``Those of you who brought those signs, tear them up and act
your age,'' said Hooks.
   The signs reflected disappointment that Dukakis had passed over
Jackson in his search for a running mate. Several delegates
expressed disgruntlement less over the fact Jackson wasn't chosen
as over the fact Dukakis did not notify him in advance of the
selection of Bentsen.
   Jackson first learned of the selection of Bentsen from reporters
when he flew in to Washington's National Airport.
   While the response at the NAACP convention was tepid, Dukakis
and Bentsen got a rousing reception on Capitol Hill earlier today
at a 45-minute private meeting with House Democrats.
   ``He sent one single message,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``He
wants to work with us and reach out to us. That's what the Congress
wants to hear.''
   Among those greeting the two men as they arrived was Rep. Bill
Gray, D-Pa., the Budget Committee chairman and a senior leader
among black House members. Gray said he had been disappointed that
Jackson was not the choice for No. 2.
   ``But it's been made, and I plan to support the ticket,'' Gray
said.
   Gray said the two men will have to begin talking about issues of
concern to blacks if they want to unite minority voters behind the
campaign. ``We are going to be concerned about long-term policy _
civil rights ... human investment,'' he said.
   Another member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which was to
meet with Dukakis and Bentsen later in the day, said he believed
the ticket has its work cut out to try to repair damage.
   ``I frankly think he's made life a lot more difficult for
himself and will have to work a lot harder,'' Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., said of Dukakis.
   At a news conference in Boston on Tuesday, Dukakis said his
selection of Bentsen would harken back to the 1960 election when
Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy turned to Texan Lyndon B.
Johnson.
   But Jackson, who had said a day earlier that he would accept
second spot on the ticket if it were offered, sounded unmoved by
such comparisons.
   Asked at a news conference if he were angry at being passed
over, Jackson replied: ``No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm
too mature to be angry. I'm focused on what we must do to keep hope
alive...''
   Jackson, who spoke to the NAACP Tuesday night, brought the crowd
to its feet when he called his campaign a great success despite
being passed over for the No. 2 spot.
   ``I may not be on the ticket, but I'm qualified! That's what I
know! Qualified!'' he shouted, to cheers.
   ``I will never surrender,'' Jackson said. ``I will not stop,
because the end has not yet come. I will run on and on.''
   The choice of Bentsen, less than a week before the start of the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, was hailed by most
Democrats and even a few Republicans.
   And both men got a standing ovation today at the end of their
meeting with House Democrats, where Dukakis promised to forge a
cooperative relationship with Capitol Hill if elected.
   ``I think the party's together like I haven't seen it in my
political career,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, a conservative Txas
Democrat. He said the Bentsen choice ``brings the experience and
moderate-conservative balance to the ticket that a lot of us were
looking for.''
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Dukakis invited all
Democratic officeholders from coast to coast to become involved in
the campaign.
   ``It was pointed out that some of us don't live between Boston
and Austin. This was an invitation to Congress to become completely
involved in the campaign effort,'' Miller said. ``It was a unity
fest.''

   Carolyn Benally, a Navajo employment
officer, got some action when she complained to a local paper about
favoritism in tribal civil service hiring. She was fired.
   Her lawyer, John Chapela, offers little encouragement for
redress. He is only in private practice because he was dismissed as
head of the Navajo Housing Authority for being, he said, in the
wrong party.
   Civil rights attorneys say the Navajos have perhaps the best of
any tribal court system, but they point to a recent scandal and
allegations of civil rights abuses as evidence that individual
Navajos face discrimination by tribal leaders.
   Chairman Peter MacDonald, who spoke in an interview with charm
and persuasion of his plans to restore Navajo prosperity, denied
any wrongdoing. He has never been indicted, much less convicted.
   But even close associates acknowledge that recent developments
provide cause for raised eyebrows.
   A major scandal is ``Bogate,'' the tribe's purchase of the Big
Boquillas Ranch near Tuba City, Ariz., a year ago.
   Middlemen paid Tenneco West $26.2 million for it. Five minutes
later, the Navajos bought the ranch for $33.4 million.
   MacDonald, in an interview, said the Navajos paid a fair price
and did not know what the intermediary purchasers had paid. A
commission to the middlemen was normal, he said, adding: ``That's
partly how business is done in America.''
   But a principal middleman was an old associate who had raised
money for MacDonald's campaigns. The ranch had been on the market
20 years.
   Shortly after the Tribal Council approved the purchase, Coconino
County records show, MacDonald paid off the loan on his retirement
home.
   The circumstances prompted separate investigations by the
Inspector-General of the Interior Department, the Internal Revenue
Service and the FBI. All are still under way.
   More recently, MacDonald sought to assert tribal control over
the Navajo Education and Scholarship Foundation, regarded as a
sinecure for his arch rival Peterson Zah, the former chairman.
   Zah, locked out of his office, got a court order barring anyone
from evicting him. The tribe found another judge. After a judicial
tug-of-war, police shut down the whole building, leaving 80 other
employees in the street.
   ``The integrity of the Navajo Nation law has been reduced to
this game of musical doorknobs,'' observed Duane Beyal, Zah's
spokesman.
   Shortly after a group of workers marched to MacDonald's office
to ask for alternate quarters, two participants were fired,
although the tribe gave other reasons for their dismissal.
   Dissent has been rare since MacDonald shut down the
independent-minded Navajo Times daily in 1986, expelling editors
before they could produce the next morning's edition. MacDonald
said the tribe-owned paper was losing money.
   Nevertheless, the tribe spends $2 million a year on public
relations firms and Washington lobbyists, MacDonald acknowledged.
   Chapela, who is collecting signatures for a recall that can take
place only with approval from MacDonald's hand-picked council,
said, ``His goal is to bankrupt the Navajo Nation to finance his
gold-plated retirement.''
   Other sources speak to visitors in whispered asides, or through
notes passed at the Navajo Nation Motor Inn, the focal point of
this windswept capital city in northern Arizona.
   But, warned a non-Indian lawyer with long experience on the
reservation, allegations are not proof. ``If MacDonald is a
crook,'' he said, ``he is a smart one.'' To protect himself, the
lawyer insisted on anonymity.

   The state Board of Education today voted
to take control of the finances of the debt-ridden Pike County
school system, citing widespread nepotism in Kentucky's
third-largest district.
   The action means that the 15,250-student school system cannot
make purchases or hire anyone without written approval from state
school Superintendent John Brock.
   The board acted after receiving a consultants' report detailing
dozens of management problems within the state's easternmost
county, a coal-mining area with 87,000 residents.
   ``Beyond what we see in writing, there are unique political
problems in Pike County at the present time,'' Brock said.
   The requirement that Brock approve all personnel actions will
relieve the five-member local board of political pressure to hire
friends and relatives of influential county residents, the state
superintendent said.
   Increased layoffs in the coal industry, the consultants said,
had resulted in greater pressure on local board members to hire
more people in the schools.
   In some schools, two-thirds to three-quarters of employees are
related by blood or marriage.
   The consultants' report said the district would begin a third
straight school year with a deficit budget. The district's debt,
which was about $2,000,000, is now about $500,000.
   The report said the district needs to control spending, close
several schools, reduce non-teaching staff and make an effort to
collect delinquent taxes.
   In May, the New Jersey education commissioner announced the
state intends to take over Jersey City's 32,000-student district,
under fire for a high dropout rate, political hiring and firing and
questionable finances.
   Besides Kentucky and New Jersey, South Carolina, Texas and New
Mexico have laws allowing state takeovers of failing school
districts.
   Laws in Illinois and Arkansas let the state eliminate deficient
districts. An Ohio law allows the state to revoke a troubled
district's charter. Georgia officials may impose heavy financial
penalties on such districts.

   Michael Dukakis told black leaders today that running mate Lloyd
Bentsen has been a civil rights advocate since ``way back when in
the 1940s,'' while a disappointed Jesse Jackson was described as
flabbergasted at the way he has been treated by the Democratic
nominee-to-be.
   Jackson convention manager Ron Brown said negotiations with the
Dukakis campaign have been halted.
   ``It is now up to Michael Dukakis to make it a unity
convention,'' Brown said in an interview in Atlanta.
   Brown said Jackson and his aides could not understand what they
felt was a deliberate Dukakis snub of Jackson, who learned from
reporters that Bentsen was the vice presidential choice.
   ``Basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled,''
Brown said.
   At the annual meeting of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People in Washington, Dukakis sought black
support in a speech that was mostly a straight campaign talk.
   NAACP President Benjamin Hooks told Dukakis, ``You know, knowing
Jesse has been good for you.''
   And Dukakis replied, ``Yes, Ben, I learned a lot from Jesse and
I've learned a lot from you....And I'm still learning.''
   As Dukakis and Bentsen wrestled with how to unify the party in
advance of nest week's convention in Atlanta, most Democrats sang a
chorus of praise for the 67-year-old Texas senator after his formal
introduction as Dukakis' running mate at Boston's Faneuil Hall.
Hopeful refrains citing the parallels with the 1960 Kennedy-Johnson
ticket were heard again and again.
   ``He's a terrific guy. He's very tough, very smart,'' Oregon
Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said of Bentsen.
   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, the 1984 Democratic
presidential nominee, said Bentsen ``has been a source of good
sense, moderation and decency throughout his years of public life.''
   ``He knows how to beat George Bush,'' said Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md. ``He did just that in 1970'' _ when Bentsen
defeated Bush for the first of three terms in the Senate.
   Bush, the Republican nominee-to-be, called Dukakis' choice of
the Senate Finance Committee chairman ``interesting'' but refused
to say more.
   Bush's supporters were quick to argue that Democrats still won't
carry the state Bush calls home _ and its 29 electoral votes _ in
the November balloting.
   ``He is desperate. He knows he can't win without carrying
Texas,'' Texas Gov. Bill Clements said of Dukakis. ``It ain't going
to work.''
   But the Jackson problem loomed as the major stumbling block
between Dukakis and seamlessly positive four days in Atlanta.
   At the NAACP, Dukakis referred to Bentsen's long committment to
civil rights.
   ``He was committed to civil rights and equal opportunities way
back then, way back then in the 1940s,'' Dukakis said.
   Bentsen then addressed the meeting, with an admonition from
Hooks.
   ``You may as well know you've got a hard act today, so do your
best,'' Hooks said. ``Many of our delegates wanted to see Jesse in
this position.''
   Former party chief and Jackson adviser John White echoed those
sentiments about his fellow Texan: ``He's got one of the best civil
rights records in the Senate. He voted against the poll tax when he
was in the Congress back in the '50s.''
   It was clear that the Democratic ticket needed to calm some
angry Jackson backers.
   ``I did think he was very rude not to let Jesse know
beforehand,'' said Beulah C. Wright of Main Line, Pa., a NAACP
delegate.
   ``I frankly think he's made life a lot more difficult for
himself and will have to work a lot harder,'' said Rep. Ron
Dellums, a Jackson supporter from California.
   Jackson spoke to NAACP Tuesday night, delivering an emotional
speech that drew cheers from the overflow crowd.
   ``I may not be on the ticket, but I'm qualified! That's what I
know! Qualified!'' Jackson shouted. ``I will never surrender.''
   The civil rights leader promised that he would press his stands
on the issues at the convention that opens Monday.
   ``We go to Atlanta not to smile and style and profile, but to
deliberate and debate our nation's priorities,'' Jackson said.
   Ann Lewis, a top Jackson adviser, said today that the
presidential hopeful will strike a positive tone at the convention.
   ``You're going to see a Jesse Jackson who is forward looking,
who's talking about the fall, who's talking about the issues,'' she
said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Earlier Tuesday, at a news conference, Jackson insisted he was
not angry at the Dukakis decision.
   ``No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be
angry. I'm focused on what we must do to keep hope alive,'' he said.
   Earlier, Jackson had clearly been upset that he learned of
Dukakis' choice from reporters rather than from the Massachusetts
governor directly.
   Bush spoke to the NAACP ahead of all the Democrats, addressing
them early on Tuesday. He didn't mention Bentsen, but he did praise
Jackson.
   ``I salute him for running the race, for being heard, and he
deserves a salute from us,'' the vice president said.
   Late Tuesday, on the way to baseball's All-Star game in
Cincinnati, Bush had only a brief remark on the choice of Bentsen:
``That's interesting. That's what I think about it.''
   Dukakis often compares himself to the last president from
Massachusetts _ John F. Kennedy _ and invited more comparisons of
his decision for Bentsen with Kennedy's selection of Texas Sen.
Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960.
   Bentsen put it this way: ``The Massachusetts and the Texas axis
was good for the country and good for the Democratic Party in 1960
and it's going to be a real winner in November of '88.''
   ``There's something lucky about a Massachusetts-Texas
connection,'' said North Carolina Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan.
   ``The Boston-Austin axis is reborn,'' applauded Rep. Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri, a former contender for the Democratic
nomination.
   ``He will help the ticket in the south and all over the
country,'' added Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, another former
hopeful for both the presidential and vice presidential nominations.
   Another former hopeful, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, said,
``When the American people get to know Lloyd Bentsen, it will
strengthen the ticket everywhere.''
   The preparations for Monday's opening session in Atlanta
intensified as construction work in the convention hall was wrapped
up. The trickle of delegates, party pros and news people arriving
in the city turned to a steady flow.
   Polls in Texas said Bentsen would help Dukakis there, but
nationally the polls said the voters knew little of the Texan.
   ``It's like dropping a rock in a pond and having no ripples. ...
They're both unknowns'' to Californians, said Golden State pollster
Mervin Field.

   Nanking residents set off firecrackers to welcome
a rainstorm that broke a 10-day heat wave in which 83 people died,
an official report said Wednesday.
   Torrential rains fell for 45 minutes Tuesday night in the
eastern city, causing the temperature to fall from 102 to 95, the
Xinhua News Agency said.
   People rushed into the streets and let off firecrackers in
celebration, the report said. It said forecasters predicted more
rain.
   Xinhua said Monday that 83 people had died and 1,500 were
hospitalized because of the heat, most of them elderly.
   Temperatures had hovered from 100 to 102 since July 2 in what
Xinhua called the third-worst heat wave since 1905.
   It did not say when the worst heat wave occurred. Nanking
typically has hot summers, earning it the nickname ``furnace.''

<TEXT>
   A convicted Mafia boss was ambushed and
shot to death near this Sicilian capital in what police described
as a settlement of accounts between rival gangs.
   Pietro Messicati Vitale, 41, was hit by at least five shots of a
lupara _ the sawed-off shotgun traditionally used by the Mafia _ as
he rode a motorcycle Tuesday to his vacation villa looking out on
Capo Zafferano Bay.
   Messicati Vitale was arrested in 1985 and later sentenced to
eight years in prison after being convicted on charges of criminal
association. The prosecution described him as the boss of a drug
trafficking ring.
   He was released a month ago because of a procedural error in his
trial and was awaiting a second trial.

   Bret Starr, the 24-year-old son of NFL Hall
of Famer Bart Starr, died of cocaine use, authorities ruled today.
   ``The official ruling from the medical examiner is cardiac
arrhythmia due to acute cocaine indulgence,'' said Hillsborough
Sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa. ``It's not necessarily an
overdose.''
   Starr died July 4 or 5 in his suburban home, authorities said.
His body, unrecognizable because of decomposition, was found July 7
when his father, unable to contact him, went to the house.
   The elder Starr, the quarterback who led the Green Bay Packers
during the glory years of the 1960s and later returned as coach,
said at a news conference in Green Bay, Wis., today: ``Drugs do
kill. He only had traces and yet the traces killed him.''
   The football star talked about his son's battle with cocaine in
his recent book, ``My Life in Football: Starr.''
   ``Unbeknownst to us, by the time Bret graduated from high school
he was well on his way to a cocaine addiction,'' the father wrote,
explaining the family's repeated efforts to get him help.

<HEAD>Donated Collection of Ezra Pound's Poems Worth $25,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare collection of Ezra Pound's poems
valued at $25,000 has been found in a carton of old books donated
to the University of North Carolina.
   The book was discovered by librarian Charles McNamara, the
school said Tuesday.
   ``I was kind of stunned,'' said McNamara. ``I was saying to
myself, `This can't be true.'''
   The book, ``A Lume Spento,'' was published in Italy in 1908, and
most of the 100 copies were given by the American poet to his
friends, McNamara said.
   The book found last year is inscribed by Pound to Dr. Margaret
E. Hennessey, a great-aunt of Elizabeth Brainard of Chapel Hill,
who donated the books with her husband, Harry, an alumnus of the
school.
   Pound was born in Idaho in 1885 and died in Italy in 1972.
   McNamara said he contacted the Brainards to tell them about the
value of the book, but the Brainards didn't want it back.
   ``We just thought it belonged in a university library,'' said
Brainard, a professor emeritus at Michigan State University.

<HEAD>Blood Pressure Drug Tested To Prevent Heart Enlargement</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A widely used blood pressure medicine appears to
reduce progressive enlargement of the heart, a common and hazardous
complication of heart attacks, according to a preliminary study.
   Heart enlargement can lead to congestive heart failure, a
condition that leaves victims exhausted and short of breath.
   In their study, doctors tested the effects of captopril, one of
a group of drugs known as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
that are used to lower high blood pressure.
   The study was not large enough to determine whether the
treatment helps people live longer or should be widely used after
heart attacks.
   ``Although our study suggests that there may be a long-term
benefit to treating some patients before they develop symptoms,
captopril must be further evaluated before we can recommend its
general use for post-heart attack patients at risk for cardiac
enlargement,'' said Dr. Marc A. Pfeffer.
   Pfeffer's study, conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The study was performed on 59 heart attack victims who were at
high risk of heart enlargement. During a year of follow-up, further
enlargement stopped in those who got captopril but not in a
comparison group.
   Pfeffer and other researchers have begun a major study to see if
the therapy saves lives and prevents heart failure. The treatment
will be studied in about 2,200 patients at 41 hospitals over five
years.

<HEAD>Bentsen: Texas Millionaire Is Quintessential Washington Insider</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen retired from the House of
Representatives in 1954 at the age of 33, declaring he wanted to
make some real money. Announcing for the Senate 16 years later, the
new millionaire explained, ``I want to be ... remembered for
something other than my financial statement.
   ``I think people are a little bit like ivy,'' the Texas Democrat
added, ``They ought to be repotted once in a while.''
   At 67, Bentsen is looking to be repotted once again _ as vice
president. Likely Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
named Bentsen as his running mate Tuesday.
   Bentsen brings to the ticket more than a Southwestern flavor and
a chance for Democrats to carry his big home state. After 17{ years
in the Senate, 1{ years as chairman of the Finance Committee and a
stint as chief fund-raiser for Democratic senators, he is as much a
Washington insider as Dukakis is not _ a situation reminiscent of
the Carter-Mondale ticket in 1976.
   Bentsen is tall, slim and dapper, a millionaire with a patrician
air. He is also a highly decorated World War II bomber pilot,
lawyer, Presbyterian and native Texan who has close ties with
business, a strong record on civil rights and a history of
supporting two of his home state's biggest industries: oil and the
military. Like Dukakis, he speaks fluent Spanish.
   He is a forceful committee chairman who is seldom heard to raise
his voice and who rarely seeks out the television cameras. Like
Dukakis, he speaks fluent Spanish. Although he flopped at his own
try for the presidency in 1976, Bentsen is credited with having the
strongest Texas political organization in in modern times; it was
he who denied George Bush a seat in the Senate in 1970.
   Publicly, at least, Bentsen has done little in Washington to
ruffle feathers. He admitted fault so quickly in his only hint at
personal scandal that he almost turned it into a plus.
   That came in January 1987, immediately after he took over as
Finance Committee chairman, when he solicited lobbyists to have
breakfast with him once a month for a $10,000 campaign
contribution. Once the story broke and critics raised the specter
of a powerful lawmaker offering himself for sale, it took Bentsen
only a couple days to back down.
   ``I'm not known to make many mistakes, but when I do it's a
doozy,'' he said in a statement, ``and in forming that breakfast
club I really blew it. ... The last thing I want is anything that
would reflect on my integrity.''
   Until taking over the Finance Committee, Bentsen was little
known outside Washington.
   He had had a stint in the late 1970s as chairman of the Joint
Economic Committee, a panel that does not write legislation, and
used the post to advocate tax cuts to spur investment and savings _
long before President Reagan came to power with promises of such a
program.
   By the time Sen. Russell B. Long, D-La., retired as chairman of
the Finance Committee in 1986, giving Bentsen a chance to push his
own ideas, Reagan's plan had been written into law.
   Bentsen often is described as a centrist. In 1986, a
conservative rating group gave him a 50 for his Senate votes; a
liberal group rated him at 45. He supported Democratic party-line
votes 46 percent of the time and opposed them 50 percent of the
time.
   As chairman of the Finance Committee, Bentsen is well-placed to
put his mark on legislation dealing with taxes, trade, welfare,
health insurance and Social Security. As chairman, he seems to push
for the middle ground as often as he was pulled toward a consensus
in earlier days on the committee.
   Thus, in an effort to get a trade bill that President Reagan
would sign, Bentsen accepted several House provisions, especially
those aimed at protecting U.S. workers and at retaliating against
unfair trade practices, that were less than he wanted.
   Republicans controlled the Finance Committee when the massive
1986 tax overhaul was enacted, and Bentsen faced the prospect of
voting to repeal major provisions _ including the investment credit
and capital-gains preferences _ that he had supported. In the end,
he voted for repeal in order to pay for a significant rate
reduction for most individuals and corporations, but he was never
enthusiastic about the package.
   The Texan has fought feverishly to retain special tax treatment
for the oil industry, especially the independent companies not
affiliated with the giant major firms. His biggest battle over the
1986 bill was a losing effort to soften the bite on real estate
developers, although he had called for some change on grounds the
old law was far too generous.
   Under Bentsen's leadership, the Finance Committee this year has
cranked out landmark bills overhauling the welfare system and
expanding Medicare to cover some costs of catastrophic illness.
   Bentsen, who served briefly as a county judge, used his family's
considerable wealth to win election to the House for the first time
in 1948. He retired after three terms to run his own lucrative
insurance and financial services business.
   He won election to the Senate in 1970 by unseating liberal Sen.
Ralph Yarborough in the Democratic primary. He defeated Bush in
November with 54 percent of the votes and was re-elected in 1976
with 57 percent and in 1982 with 59 percent.
   Bentsen has been married for 44 years to Beryl Ann Bentsen _
known as B.A. _ a former fashion model. They have three grown
children.

   Jesse Jackson has halted all pre-convention
negotiations with the campaign of Michael Dukakis after the
handling of the vice presidential announcement left the Jackson
forces ``flabbergasted,'' his convention manager said today.
   Ron Brown, one of Jackson's closest advisers, said Jackson was
incredulous that Dukakis did not call him, as Jackson had been told
would happen, before the vice presidential decision was announced.
Jackson said he learned of the Lloyd Bentsen selection from
reporters about an hour before receiving a call from Dukakis.
   ``Basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled,''
Brown said.
   Looking ahead to next week's party convention here, the Jackson
forces are on hold regarding the ongoing platform and issues
discussions they were holding with Dukakis' people, he said.
   He said the ball is in Dukakis' court to undo the damage by
reaching out to Jackson, and he said the Jackson campaign's
demeanor at the convention depends on that.
   The campaign is keeping its options open for convention floor
fights, he said, declining to elaborate.
   ``It is now up to Michael Dukakis to make it a unity
convention,'' Brown said.
   As to the delay in telling Jackson about the Bentsen selection,
Brown said it seems unlikely it was an oversight.
   ``It seems like too big a mistake that politically astute people
would make,'' Brown said.
   When Dukakis finally called him Tuesday morning to inform him
rather than consult with him, Jackson kept the conversation short.
``There was no explanation ... there was nothing else to say,''
said Brown.

<HEAD>U.S. Asks OAS To Approve Expulsion Of Nicaraguan Ambassador</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department formally asked the
Organization of American States today to approve the expulsion of
Nicaragua's ambassador to the United States who also serves as OAS
ambassador.
   Richard McCormack, the U.S. ambassador to the international
body, delivered a note to Ambassador Eladio Knipping of the
Dominican Republic, who is also president of the OAS permament
council.
   ``If you (are) in violation of your diplomatic status in the
United States, Article 3 of the OAS Privileges and Immunity
Agreement does not exempt you from expulsion,'' said Russell
Wapensky, a State Department official.
   Meanwhile, Richard Melton, the U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua who
was expelled by the Sandinista government along with seven
colleagues, said today he believes Nicaragua took the action in
order to intimidate the opposition.
   Melton told a White House news conference that the Sandinistas
wanted to demonstrate to the opposition that ``they are alone and
isolated with nowhere to turn.''
   He noted that one of the functions of those expelled was to deal
with opposition leaders. He flatly denied that the embassy was
involved in organizing and financing the opposition.
   On Capitol Hill, senators angered by Melton's expulsion and the
shutting down of the newspaper La Prensa and the Catholic radio
station prepared to introduce legislation condemning the Sandinista
government and providing further economic and perhaps military
assistance to the Contras.
   ``We are moving now because the Sandinista goons have been in
the streets of Managua again ... because the light of freedom has
been nearly snuffed out again,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said a bipartisan group of
lawmakers is drafting a House resolution that ``will call upon the
Nicaraguan government to re-open the organs of free expression and
repeal the law that permits the response they made.''
   Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee attempted to hold a
public hearing to question Melton on the reasons behind his
expulsion but were blocked by an objection lodged by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., an opponent of Contra aid.
   Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., told reporters that he and other
committee members had questioned Melton privately and found no
indication that either he or any of his fellow diplomats were
engaged in espionage or other acts that might have justified their
expulsion.
   Earlier, Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann said he would
consult with his government on whether to challenge the legality of
the U.S. decision to order him out of the country.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said today on NBC-TV's
``Today'' that the United States has no plans to cut diplomatic
ties with Managua despite the tit-for-tat ambassadorial expulsions.
   ``It's important for us to maintain contact in some kind of
relations even with government that we have very little respect
for,'' Whitehead said.
   He said Managua's actions, including the closing down of an
opposition newspaper and radio station, show that ``the last
vestiges of freedom in Nicaragua seem to be disappearing.''
   The State Department, after formally notifying Tunnermann of the
expulsion order, said Tuesday night that the envoy and military
attache Major Pedro Sampson Mendoza had engaged in ``abuses'' which
warrant their expulsion. Six other Nicaraguan diplomats were also
ordered expelled.
   At issue in whether Tunnermann can be expelled is his dual role
as both ambassador to the United States and to the OAS, an
international body whose diplomats are protected from retaliation
under its charter.
   ``We need to prove that each state of the Organization of
American States has the right to appoint its ambassador to the OAS.
That is the problem which is now under question,'' Tunnermann told
reporters after he met with Under Secretary of State Michael
Armacost.
   Hours earlier, President Reagan said he was ordering Tunnermann
and seven of his diplomatic colleagues out of the country in
retaliation for Nicaragua's expulsion of eight American diplomats,
including Ambassador Richard Melton.
   ``We're going to do to him (President Daniel Ortega) what he did
to us,'' Reagan said.
   But by leaving the clear impression that the expulsion order was
purely retaliatory, he left an opening for a challenge to the
legality of the move because of Tunnermann's role as OAS
ambassador. Hence, the State Department's statement later that he
was being expelled for unspecified ``abuses.''
   The OAS is a 32-member regional body which attempts to solve
diplomatic disputes and to promote hemispheric cooperation.
   Tunnermann said he had discussed by telephone with government
officials in Managua the possibility of defying the U.S. expulsion
order but that no decision had been reached. He said the current
case was the first of its kind in the history of the OAS, whose
origins date back 99 years.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
Tunnermann and his colleagues were given until Friday to leave the
United States. The 72-hour period is the same that was given to
U.S. diplomats in Managua to depart.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said Monday that
Melton and seven U.S. Embassy aides were ordered to leave the
country because they were engaged in ``activities complementary to
the state terrorism the administration of U.S. President Ronald
Reagan is carrying out against Nicaragua.''
   Mrs. Oakley called the charges false and said they are not
worthy of further comment. She added that the Sandinista action
follows a ``virulent propaganda campaign directed at subduing and
intimidating the people of Nicaragua and suppressing any dissent.''
   Responding to questions from reporters, Mrs. Oakley said the
Nicaraguan envoys were being expelled not only as retaliation but,
in the cases of Tunnermann and Sampson, for ``abuse of their
privileges of residence in the United States.'' She did not
elaborate.
   She said that other measures against Nicaragua are being
considered but she gave no details. Reagan raised the possibility
of a break in relations but other officials said that step was
unlikely.
   Tunnermann spoke with indignation to reporters in describing his
session with Armacost. He denied ever having violated the rules
governing his stay here.
   Tunnermann said when he demanded that Armacost present proof,
Armacost replied, ``Well, some day.''
   The expulsion of the U.S. diplomats drew an angry reaction from
the House Democratic leadership, which has been unalterably opposed
to U.S. aid to the Contra rebels.
   Wright said he had spoken Tuesday with Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias about the developments. ``He and I both agree that it
is a thoroughly deplorable and retrogressive development,'' Wright
said.

   Guerrillas attacked revelers at a

   AIM said in a dispatch Tuesday that it was the first large-scale
attack by the Mozambique National Resistance on residents of Beira,
a port on the Indian Ocean coast.
   AIM said about 50 guerrillas attacked Beira's suburb of
Inhamizua late Saturday night while residents were dancing and

   The guerrillas have been waging a hit-and-run insurgency since
1977 that has left hundreds of thousands of people homeless and in
need of food aid.

   If Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen head out on
the campaign trail singing ``Vaya Con Dios'' to one another, it
will be understandable _ the language at least, if not the singing
part.
   While neither of the reserved politicians is known for bursting
into song, both are known to speak fluent Spanish.
   Thus, the Democrats have a twosome that should be able to
communicate well with voters in the Southwest and other
heavily-Hispanic regions.
   Bentsen grew up in south Texas just a few miles from the Mexican
border, a bicultural region where Spanish is widely spoken.
   Dukakis honed his Spanish many years ago while studying in Peru.
He made effective use in California and Texas primaries of a
Spanish-language ad in which he spoke directly to voters, rather
than using Spanish voiceover as is commonly done.

<HEAD>Report: Minority Kids Fall Behind Early in Math</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A two-year study found that minority
children often fall behind in math skills as early as the third
grade.
   The $125,000 study, described as one of the nation's most
extensive examination of math education, looked at 28,000 students
from kindergarten through the 12th grade in Montgomery County
outside Washington.
   It consisted of anaylses of various tests and interviews with
students, parents, principals and counselors.
   According to the study, funded by the National Science
Foundation, about 8 percent of the Asians and whites in the third
grade performed below grade level, compared to 15 percent for
Hispanics and 20 percent for blacks.
   When the students reached sixth grade, the percentage of
students working below grade level climbed to 16 percent for
Asians, 22 percent for whites, 39 percent for Hispanics and 51
percent for blacks, the study found.
   The study also uncovered subtle differences in the math
accomplishments of boys and girls.
   Until the last years of high school, girls take as many math
courses as boys and do as well or better. However, by the junior
and senior years, boys take more sophisticated math courses, such
as advanced algebra and calculus.
   Boys also tend to do better that girls on the math portion of
college entrance exams, the study found.
   Educators speculated that the reasons for the disparities could
include lower expectations of black and Hispanic students, less
preparation among minorities before they begin school, and
different views among female and minority students of their own
abilities and future careers.
   ``The demographic data is quite clear,'' Bassam Shakhasheri,
assistant director for science and engineering education at the
foundation, said at a news conference Tuesday.
   ``Before very long, around the year 2000, 85 percent of those
entering the work force will be minorities and women. The nation
requires both a good cadre of scientists and engineers and a
citizenry that understands the benefits of science and the
potential risks ... of technological advances.''
   ``That is a fairly typical finding all the way through,'' said
Elizabeth Fennema, professor of curriculum and instruction at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison.
   She noted that the racial disparities were similar to those
detected in the recent National Assessment of Educational Progress
and that several studies have found that girls do less well than
boys in ``high-order'' math skills.

<HEAD>Engineers: Many Records Missing In Texas Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An engineer investigating the collapse
of a Texas department store that killed 14 people said today that
important building records are missing.
   Gary G. Nichols and Glenn J. Winslow, civil engineers with
Birmingham-based Southern Building Code Congress International
Inc., are the primary investigators of the collapse last week of
the Amigo Store in Brownsville.
   ``We've been told that the building department has moved two or
three times over the period of time when the building was built and
some of the records may have been involved in a flood,'' Nichols
said Wednesday.
   He said the city is still going through its records, which were
stored in several different places, in search of construction plans
for the building.
   The engineers said their investigation has been hampered by
sketchy information from witnesses and the absence of records,
including specifications.
   The two were in Brownsville Saturday through Monday searching
for clues to the July 7 collapse of the three-story building during
a heavy rainstorm.
   ``Right now we don't know why it happened,'' Winslow said
Tuesday. ``We may not ever know what caused it.''
   A preliminary report on the collapse should be complete late
this week, he said, adding that a complete report will take months
to complete.
   Nichols said he and Winslow are looking into the possibility
that the rain may have caused the collapse. If the building's drain
pipes were clogged, water could have backed up and its weight
triggered the fall, he said.
   Nichols and Winslow work for a non-profit agency that writes
building codes for governments.
   Its engineers examine building materials and write
recommendations on how they should be used in construction and
examine structures that have fallen.
   Nearly 2,000 city, county and state building departments are
served by the organization.

   An FBI official testified Wednesday that
criticism of the bureau's Library Awareness Program has been
``overblown,'' and that agents making official visits to libraries
are interested solely in the activities of Soviet spies.
   James H. Geer, assistant director-intelligence division, told a
House panel that the program is narrowly focused, principally on
scientific and technical libraries in the New York City area.
   Geer said the FBI made 21 contacts with Greater New York
libraries between late 1985 and 1987. Most visits simply alerted
librarians to use of their facilities by Soviet agents engaged in
recruiting and information-gathering, he said.
   Visits to libraries outside New York were not part of any
program, but resulted from leads in specific counter-intelligence
cases, Geer told the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil rights.
   Organizations of librarians and civil liberties groups have
asserted there is a pattern of FBI interest in libraries across the
country, and have accused the bureau of intimidating library
employees.
   They said the bureau was trying to to enlist library personnel
as spies, to identify patrons who might be gathering information
for foreign powers. Librarians, they said, were given broad
requests to monitor patrons with Russian or Eastern-European
sounding names.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, said
some of the nation's most respected librarians are ``scared to
death'' of the program.
   Geer tried to assure Edwards that ``This isn't any kind of a
massive program. I don't expect any great return.'' Edwards replied
that there has been ``a massive public reaction'' against the
program.
   The FBI official testified, ``Our library contacts seek to
inform selected librarians that they and their libraries are, and
have historically been, significant SIS (Soviet Intelligence
Services) targets for intelligence activities and recruitment.''
   ``Suitable scenarios have been developed by the SIS to approach
students, librarians, scientists and engineers to secure their
cooperation. Payments or other inducements have been offered,'' he
said.
   Geer said lists of patrons with foreign-sounding names or
accents ``are not of interest or concern to the bureau.''
   He also denied that the FBI has used physical or electronic
surveillance in libraries contacted under the awareness program.
Nor has it asked employees to circumvent confidentiality rules or
laws, he said.

   Jury selection began today in the trial
of a free-lance journalist and a Lutheran minister accused of
smuggling two pregnant Salvadoran women into the United States in
1986.
   Demetria Martinez and the Rev. Glen Remer-Thamert, both of
Albuquerque, were indicted Dec. 10.
   The case has been embraced by the sanctuary movement of clergy
and lay people who have been aiding refugees from Central America
since the early 1980s.
   However, U.S. Attorney William Lutz has charged in court papers
that Remer-Thamert was selling Salvadoran babies for adoption, not
helping political refugees.
   U.S. District Judge John Conway today asked prospective jurors
if they were familiar with the sanctuary movement, which contends
religious beliefs outweigh the law when helping Central Americans
flee their wartorn countries.
   Remer-Thamert, 44, was charged with conspiracy, transporting and
harboring illegal aliens and mail fraud. Ms. Martinez, 28, was
charged with transporting and inducing illegal aliens.
   The indictment also accused the minister of submitting false
expense documents to an adoption agency and of receiving $2,900.
   Remer-Thamert has said he acted out of humanitarian concerns and
was charged because of his criticism of the Reagan administration's
Central American policies.
   Ms. Martinez contends she was along on the trip from El Paso,
Texas, to Albuquerque in her capacity as a journalist.

   The Democratic National Convention next week is
expected to cost the city of Atlanta about $15 million with the
Georgia legislature and a few local banks already taking care of
much of the fund-raising.
   In New Orleans, site of the Republican Convention on Aug. 15-18,
the city has struggled to come up with the funds to pay for
security measures, 5,000 upholstered chairs and the lighting and
sound systems for the Superdome.
   The two host cities, faced with expensive convention pricetags,
have taken different paths toward raising the money to pay the
bills.
   In Atlanta, the total cost for the four-day convention is $24
million with the Democratic Party picking up $9 million of the tab.
The remaining cost will be raised from a 2-cent hotel-motel tax in
effect in the city and Fulton County through July 1990.
   Last year, the state legislature passed a bill increasing the
tax and earmarking the money for the Atlanta '88 Committee Inc., a
non-profit corporation created by the city, county and state to
plan and stage the convention.
   ``We have a nice cushion built in, in what we need to borrow and
what our interest revenues are going to be,'' said Atlanta '88
president Bobby Kahn. ``There would have to be a virtual depression
in the convention industry for our revenue projections not to be
met.''
   Two Atlanta banks also agreed in late May to provide a loan of
up to $9 million to help cover the costs until Atlanta '88 receives
those revenues.
   In New Orleans, early fund-raising was slow and complaints by
the Greater New Orleans Convention Fund that big companies were
failing to contribute forced Mayor Sidney Barthelemy to appoint
another committee.
   The second committee, formed on May 12, immediately launched an
intensified campaign that came up with cash and commitments of more
than $250,000.
   Hotels have pledged 10 percent of the money they receive from
rooms in use during the convention _ an estimated $1.5 million.
   ``I think we're going to be on target,'' said Ron Jones, who is
heading the New Orleans fund-raising effort. ``This has always been
a town that gets its big hits late.''
   Jones, president of Louisiana Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and
chairman of the Business Council of New Orleans, said that in an
effort to raise money, special perks will be added for people who
give $1,000 or more, including tickets to the convention, admission
to parks and museums and invitations to receptions with the mayor
and governor.
   Atlanta '88, which was organized immediately after Atlanta was
awarded the Democratic Convention in February 1987, has not faced
the same financial problems although it must pay some high costs.
   Among the expenses are $1.3 million for rental of the Omni
Coliseum, which began May 28; $875,000 for rental of the Georgia
World Congress Center and parking, which began July 1, and $2
million for construction of among other things, lighting grids, a
sound system, seat removal and podium construction, said Ruth
Berry, press secretary for the Democratic National Convention
Committee.

<TEXT>
   Residents of this posh community that
once tried to ban men from jogging topless needn't be worried any
more about having their tranquil evenings disturbed by the
whooshing sound of tennis ball machines.
   Town Council gave final approval Tuesday to an ordinance
restricting the use of the electric servers. Town officials had
considered an outright ban.
   ``The council received several complaints from people who found
the noise obnoxious and a nuisance,'' town attorney John Randolph
said today.
   ``We don't anticipate that this is a great problem in the town
or that it will have to be used very often.''
   Palm Beach was lampooned by Garry Trudeau in ``Doonesbury'' for
a law requiring workers to carry ID cards. That law was declared
unconstitutional. The ordinance prohibiting men from topless
jogging also was struck down.
   The tennis ball machine ordinance limits their use to the same
weekday, daytime hours set aside for heavy construction.
   The regulation will be enforced only if there are complaints,
officials said. The maximum fine is $250.

<HEAD>Howard Baker To Hit Lecture Circuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House chief of staff Howard H.
Baker Jr., who said he never would write a ``kiss and tell'' book
about his experiences, is going on the lecture circuit instead.
   A spokeswoman for Baker announced Wednesday that he has signed
an exclusive contract with the Harry Walker agency, a New
York-based lecture management firm that also represents former
president Gerald Ford, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
and Baker's predecessor as chief of staff, Donald T. Regan.
   Baker's first speech will be at the Institutional Investors
Conference next Tuesday in Asheville, N.C., on the subject, ``What
the Next President of the United States Needs to Know,'' according
to a news release from Jennifer Hirschberg of the Washington public
relations firm of Ogilvy & Mather.
   Baker, a former Republican senator from Tennessee who served
four years as minority leader and four as majority leader of the
Senate, ran unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination in
1980. He was considering making the race again before he came to
the White House as chief of staff in 1987. He recently resigned
after 16 months in the job.
   Amid the furor that arose after publication of Regan's book,
``For the Record,'' which discussed first lady Nancy Reagan's
interest in astrology, among other things, Baker said he had no
plans to write a similar book after he left his post.
   In the Ogilvy & Mather release, Baker was quoted as saying, ``I
look forward to this next phase in my career. I welcome the
opportunity to take a step back as it were and review the landscape
of public life. I've seen many changes in Washington, some good and
some bad. ... I am most intrigued by shifts in the balance of power
between Congress and the White House and their effects on the inner
workings of government.''

   A proud and defiant Jesse Jackson is vowing to
keep fighting to Atlanta for the presidential nomination and the
causes he believes in. When the air clears, he says, ``I no doubt
will support the ticket that the convention elects next week.''
   Several supporters said today that despite his disappointment
with being passed over by Michael Dukakis for the vice presidential
spot, Jackson already is looking ahead to next week's convention.
   ``He's going to talk about why we need a Democratic victory in
November,'' a key adviser, Ann Lewis, told CBS this morning. She
said she had spoken at length with Jackson and that in Atlanta
``you're going to see a Jesse Jackson who is forward-looking, who's
talking about the fall, who's talking about the issues.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., reflecting the wariness of many
Jackson supporters, said of Jackson: ``It was disappointing to be
interviewed for the high office of vice president one evening and
then the next morning to be notified by newspaper reporters that a
decision has been made.''
   Ron Brown, one of Jackson's closest advisers, said Jackson was
incredulous that Dukakis did not call him before he learned of the
selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. ``Basically we were
flabbergasted by the way this was handled,'' Brown said.
   He said Jackson has halted all pre-convention negotiations on
platform and other issues with the Dukakis campaign. He said it is
up to Dukakis to undo the damage by reaching out to Jackson, and he
said the Jackson campaign's demeanor at the convention depends on
that.
   ``It is now up to Michael Dukakis to make it a unity
convention,'' Brown said.
   Jackson arrived back home in Chicago today after a day in the
capital that began with a public humiliation and ended with a
throng of 2,500 people at an NAACP convention on its feet cheering
in adulation as Jackson vowed:
   ``I may or may not be on the ticket, but I'm qualified! That's
what I know! Qualified! Hold on 'til morning comes! Qualified!''
   And he added pointedly: ``This year we've earned a spot on the
ticket.''
   Michael Dukakis was addressing the civil rights organization's
convention today. Vice President George Bush also spoke to the
NAACP Tuesday.
   Jackson told reporters earlier Tuesday ``I'm too controlled, I'm
too clear, I'm too mature to be angry'' at being passed over for
the ticket.
   But he was clearly stung by the fact that he learned of
Dukakis's selection of Bentsen from reporters Tuesday morning when
his campaign jet landed in Washington.
   Bentsen was in the same airport terminal preparing to board a
private jet to Boston, but he and Jackson did not come face to
face. Dukakis called Jackson an hour later, before the official
announcement _ but after word had already gotten out.
   Maxine Waters, a California co-chair of Jackson's campaign, was
indignant about the Dukakis camp's handling of the matter.
   ``Something was wrong with that,'' she said in an interview
Tuesday night. ``Not only people who are Jackson supporters, but
people who are Dukakis supporters... think it was an awful
treatment.''
   Jackson said it would be ``inappropriate for me to comment''
upon the selection of the Texas senator since he had had ``no
opportunity for in-depth discussion with Senator Bentsen and ... no
prior discussion with Governor Dukakis'' about Bentsen's selection.
   But his emotional address to the NAACP was a clear repudiation
of any notion emanating from the Dukakis camp that it is time for
Jackson to admit he has been vanquished.
   ``I will never surrender!'' he shouted. ``I will not stop
because the end has not yet come ... I'm running because this
struggle for justice is both ancient and endless.''
   Jackson turned his attention to next week's convention, saying
it is ``not time for show business.''
   Waters raised the idea that Jackson's name might be entered into
nomination for the vice presidency _ which goes beyond anything
Jackson himself has said.
   ``We haven't developed a strategy,'' she said. ``I haven't had a
chance to look at it closely...It's an idea that we will make a
determination about in the next few days.
   Jackson, however, was talking about the presidential nomination,
not the No. 2 spot.
   ``When my name goes in nomination, our struggle is being
vindicated,'' he said. ``We go to Atlanta not to smile and style
and profile, but to deliberate and debate our nation's priorities.
   ``They say, `Well, you shouldn't do that, you're taking up our
prime-time network time. We've got drums to roll and trombones to
blow and we've got paegantry, and you can't win. You are fighting
against the odds. Don't you know?'
   ``Well, don't they know? I was born against the odds. I survived
against the odds. ... I'm an odds-breaker and a dream-maker and I
will never surrender,'' said Jackson.
   Asked at his news conference earlier Tuesday if he would
encourage supporters to enthusiastically back the Dukakis-Bentsen
ticket, Jackson said, ``We can only address that after the
nomination is over on Wednesday night.''
   But, he added: ``I no doubt will support the ticket that the
convention elects next week.''

   Heavy rain deluged some drought-hit areas as Congress began
working on a package of relief for America's farmers, and farmers
in Kentucky today greeted the arrival of the first shipment of hay
airlifted free from Oregon.
   ``Everything looks so good with a bit of rain over the past 24
hours,'' farmer Herman Krone said Tuesday at his 2,800-acre farm in
southern Illinois, which President Reagan plans to visit Thursday
during a tour of the drought-stricken area.
   However, Krone said, almost one-third of his 1,200 acres of corn
already have been lost.
   Marth Wilkinson, wife of Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and
business manager of the family's farm, was at Louisville's
Standiford Field today for the arrival of the first hay shipment
from Portland, Ore. United Parcel Service plans to ship free of
charge 20 to 30 tons of hay from Portland to Louisville each day
for the next two weeks.
   The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, issued a report
predicting severe damage to the harvest from the drought. It
estimated, for example, that corn output this year would shrivel to
5.2 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion last year.
   The dry weather is ``the largest drought that our nation has
ever experienced,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told
legislators. ``I think history will show that it's truly more
mammoth than any of us has ever experienced.''
   Extremely heavy rain fell Tuesday in sections of Texas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   In Texas, more than 6{ inches fell in 75 minutes in Mesquite,
washing a pickup truck and several cars into a creek and leaving
some homes 8 inches deep in water. Water was up to the tops of cars
in Garland and street flooding was reported in Heath. Nearly 6
inches fell in DeQueen, Ark.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widespread over the Middle
Atlantic States, the Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast states.
   Thunderstorms boomed today over the Dakotas and Minnesota.
   In Washington, the House and Senate Agriculture committees began
working on wide-ranging legislation that would provide payments of
up to $100,000 each to farmers whose crops have been wiped out by
the dry spell.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, called for final action on the measure by mid-August.
   The drought has dried up pastures, forcing livestock farmers to
go far afield for hay.
   The hay that arrived in Kentuky today will be stored at a
fairgrounds, and distributed next week by lottery to farmers, who
will pay for the hay, officials said.
   ``It seems like everyone in the state wants this hay,'' state
Department of Agriculture spokesman Roger Nesbitt said Tuesday.
   The delay has angered some farmers, such as Bernetta Smith, who
expects to run out of hay for her 147 beef cows in one to two days.
``I don't see any sense in storing it because people need this hay.
I don't understand it,'' she said.
   At least 50 truckloads of hay gathered from the Carolinas and
Virginia are being shipped to Ohio on Thursday in a drive organized
by the Charlotte Motor Speedway and the National Association for
Stock Car Auto Racing.
   Despite the recent rain, communities with dried-up water
supplies continue to restrict water use.
   Until the drought ends, the 650 residents of Vintondale, Pa.,
about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, will have to do without running
water from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. every day, Mayor Michael Palovich said
Tuesday. Palovich said he was trying to arrange for an emergency
supply to be trucked in.
   The drought has had a silver lining for anglers in the Reno,
Nevada, area. The state Board of Wildlife Commissioners removed the
limit on catches at Rye Patch and Lahontan reservoirs because the
reservoirs are expected to be dry by the end of summer, leaving
fish high and dry.

<HEAD>Republicans Ask Fazio To Recuse Himself In Wright Ethics Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans called Wednesday for Rep.
Vic Fazio, D-Calif., to step aside from the ethics committee's
conflict-of-interest case against Speaker Jim Wright because he
enlisted Wright's help for a California political fund-raiser.
   The action came in a resolution unanimously approved in a
closed-door session of the House Republican Conference, the
organization of all GOP House members, said Johanna Schneider,
spokeswoman for Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   The resolution also included a call for the ethics panel,
formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct,
to appoint an independent counsel to aid in the Wright
investigation. That matter is still under consideration by the
panel, which opened its probe June 9.
   The resolution came just four days before the Democrats open
their national convention, with Wright as chairman, in Atlanta.
   Wright has been accused by Republicans of improperly intervening
with federal regulators on behalf of Texas businesses, and of
collecting unduly high royalties on a book he wrote which was
published by a Wright campaign contractor. Copies of the book were
sold to special-interest groups, and an aide on Wright's
congressional payroll helped prepare it.
   The speaker contends the charges are politically motivated.
   Fazio, a member of the ethics panel, helped arrange for Wright
to be the featured speaker at a $500-a-plate political luncheon in
Sacramento in June, less than two weeks after the committee opened
its Wright probe.
   Republicans maintain Fazio cannot appear to be a fair judge in
the Wright case if the speaker agrees to help him raise money for
party causes. Fazio said there was nothing wrong with the
arrangement, and that political fund raising by the House speaker
is a routine matter.
   Neither Fazio nor Wright directly benefited from the luncheon,
which was to raise money to help elect Democrats to the House and
for a program called Impact 2000, aimed at helping elect Democrats
to state legislative seats to help increase the party's influence
over redistricting.
   The resolution stated that to maintain the ethics panel's
integrity, any member faced with a situation that might appear to
be a conflict ``should voluntarily excuse him or herself from those
deliberations ...'' A temporary replacement could then be named to
maintain the 6-to-6 party balance on the committee, it said.
   The document, which has no binding force but is simply an
expression of opinion by the conference, did not mention Fazio by
name. Earlier versions had included his name, but the language was
toned down at the urging of GOP members of the ethics committee,
said Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the Republican Policy
Committee.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the resolution
was part of ``an obvious attempt to politicize this (Wright
investigation) and it's most unfortunate.'' He said Fazio's ability
to be an impartial member of the panel had not been affected by the
fund-raiser.

   The Smothers Brothers, whose brief revival
during the spring was not renewed, will return to CBS for six
episodes in the fall because of the writers strike.
   The announcement Tuesday by Kim LeMasters, president of CBS
Entertainment, did not mention the strike. But LeMasters said the
return of ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' sometime in
September was part of the network's effort to ``get fresh new
product'' for the fall.
   Tom and Dick Smothers, who had not been on CBS for nearly 20
years, made their latest debut last March 30. Their eight-week run
was considered ``writer-proof'' because it consisted entirely of
previously written special material, comedy acts and music.
   The Smothers Brothers show had been one of the most popular
programs of the 1960s, but they were fired in 1969 for their
controversial political satires, and in particular their opposition
to the Vietnam War.

   Bruce Springsteen was 24 when he wrote the rock
anthem ``Born To Run.'' Now, almost 15 years later, Springsteen
says his music deals less with escapism and more with facing what
life brings.
   ``I guess what I've tried to do with most of my music is have it
reflect as much of real life as possible,'' Springsteen, 38, says
in the August issue of Mademoiselle magazine.
   ``You have to experience the whole thing, the stuff that hurts
and the stuff that feels glorious. That's where the richness of
life and experience lies.''
   Springsteen's most recent album, ``Tunnel of Love,'' reflects
the singer's maturation, with title track lyrics like: ``You've got
to learn to live with what you can't rise above.''

   Ing-Brit Kack, a Swedish clerk on
holiday, was on the deck of the City of Poros admiring the sunset
when a handsome young man 10 feet away pulled a submachine gun from
his backpack and started shooting.
   It was 7 p.m. Monday, July 11. The ship was bound for its home
dock at the Trocadero marina with 417 foreign tourists and 22 crew
members after a day-cruise through the Greek islands.
   What the brochure called a ``once in a lifetime cruise''
suddenly became a hell of gunfire, grenade explosions and raging
flames. The attack took four minutes. When it was over, nine people
were dead and 98 wounded.
   Mrs. Kack spoke from her hospital bed Tuesday of the young man
who fired first:
   ``He was sitting about three meters away from me. I saw him go
over to a storage compartment, put his backpack on it, and I
remember the clicking sound he made as he fumbled around inside. It
reminded me of a roulette wheel. ... He was obviously loading his
weapon then.''
   At least two other terrorists opened fire and hurled grenades,
setting fire to the ship. The sun deck collapsed onto passengers in
the lounge below. Some terrified passengers jumped into the Saronic
Gulf to escape.
   The terrorists got away _ in a waiting speedboat or by jumping
off the ship with pasengers, according to conflicting reports.
Security officials said they believe the attackers intended to
hijack the ship and demand the release of a Palestinian jailed in
Athens, who is accused of bombing a Pan Am jet six years ago.
   It was a hot and sunny day, perfect for a cruise, as the City of
Poros left the Trocadero marina at 8:30 a.m., passed the Peace and
Friendship sports stadium and steamed for the rocky island of Hydra.
   The ship docked at Hydra at 11:30 a.m. Most passengers got off
for a stroll through the picturesque town built of sandstone.
   Then the liner was off for Poros, the island for which it is
named. It arrived at 2:15 p.m. A French passenger's description of
the scene contrasts with the horror that was less than five hours
away:
   ``Some had lunch on board; others got off and ate in Poros.
People chatted, laughed, played cards. ... It couldn't have been a
nicer day.''
   While the vacationers were bound for Poros, a rented car blew up
near the Trocadero marina and the two men in it were blown to bits.
   Police said the car was rented by a Lebanese man identified as
Hamoud Abdul Hamid, 36, and was packed with weapons and explosives.
They theorized that the car was part of a plot to hijack the City
of Poros.
   Officers examined the remnants of the car as the ship made its
way to the island of Aegina, the last call before heading in.
   Passengers had about two hours to shop or go swimming. Harbor
authorities said the terrorists apparently boarded the ship during
that carefree time, at 6:30 p.m.
   They struck 30 minutes later, as the ship was 16 miles from home
and hundreds of passengers enjoyed the last rays of sun on the deck
or a drink in the lounge below.
   Karen Vigle, a 17-year-old student from France, said she and
some school friends had been admiring the good looks of a young
man, not knowing he would try to kill them a few minutes later.
   And then:
   ``It was like a bad dream. I heard people screaming and the
rat-a-tat of machine gun fire. ... I just lay face downwards on the
deck and waited for it all to end. Many people panicked, grabbed
life jackets and jumped overboard.''
   She was shot in the leg and burned. In a hospital bed nearby, a
critically injured friend screamed in pain as nurses changed the
dressings on her wounds.
   During the attack, one of Mrs. Kack's travel companions, Ulf
Johanson, shouted: ``For God's sake, don't move!''
   ``Those words saved my life. ... They didn't save my
sister-in-law's though,'' said Mrs. Kack, who had shrapnel wounds
and burns.
   The sister-in-law _ Irene Kack, 55 _ was among hundreds of
panic-stricken passengers who ran when the gunfire started. A
bullet in the back killed her.
   Another Swedish tourist, 66-year-old Greta Nilsson, was chatting
with friends when ``there was this huge blast and I saw my husband
rolling down the stairway.''
   ``We were talking about getting our money back because our guide
hadn't shown up for the trip when there was this terrific flash. .
.. I really thought I was going to die,'' she said. Mrs. Nilsson
was hospitalized with shock and her husband, Karlevic, 66, suffered
head injuries.
   One of six guides for 40 French school children, who asked that
his name not be used, said he put life jackets on all of them and
prepared them to jump overboard, but a tugboat pulled alongside and
they slid down ropes to its deck.
   ``It was strange, but there was suddenly complete silence,'' he
said. ``The gunmen were nowhere to be seen, there was just lots of
thick black smoke and several boats coming to our rescue.''

   A U.S. diplomat said Wednesday the United
States may be trying to play down the latest U.S.-Iran skirmish in
the Persian Gulf out of sensitivity over the Navy's destruction of
an Iranian jetliner.
   There was virtually no new information released about a clash
Tuesday night between three U.S. helicopters and several Iranian
boats in the northern gulf.
   U.S. military officials said they had no further information
about whether an Iranian speedboat was damaged in the encounter.
They said they couldn't say if the Navy had conducted a search for
debris or survivors.
   Such searches have been routine after previous clashes involving
Iran's small armed boats and U.S. helicopters.
   One U.S. officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
search would depend in part on the risk involved.
   A U.S. diplomat, who is knowledgeable about official U.S. policy
in the gulf, said U.S. authorities were providing very little
information, possibly because of the downing of the jetliner.
   ``We just don't want to be killing any more Iranians,'' he said.
``On the other hand, we don't want our people to be killed either.''
   The diplomat was referring to the shooting down of an Iran Air
A300 Airbus by the U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes on July 3. All
290 aboard died when the warship destroyed the jetliner. Navy
officials said the Vincennes crew mistook the jet for an F-14
fighter.
   Officials said Tuesday's skirmish occurred about dusk after the
U.S. missile frigate Nicholas, off the Saudi Arabian coast, heard a
Mayday message from the Universal Monarch, a Panamanian-flag tanker.
   The tanker reported it was under attack by small armed boats 15
miles west of Farsi island, a military base long used by Iran's
Revolutionary Guards for attacks on shipping.
   The Pentagon said the Nicholas' SH-60B Seahawk helicopter and
two attack helicopters responded to the distress signal and drew
fire from the Iranian boats.
   The attack aircraft retaliated with rockets and rapid-firing
Gatling guns, possibly damaging one of the boats, according to the
pilots, U.S. officials said. They said the helicopters were not hit
and there were no U.S. casualties.
   Maj. Barry Willey, a spokesman at U.S. Central Command
headquarters in Tampa, Fla., said on Wednesday there was ``no
further assessment of damage'' to the Iranian boats beyond the
initial report.
   U.S. officials, who spoke on condtion of anonymity, said the
pilots identified the attackers as ``Boston Whaler-type'' boats,
flat-bottomed, glass fiber-hulled craft powered by outboard motors
and commonly used by the Revolutionary Guards, especially around
Farsi.
   The Universal Monarch, managed by a Hong Kong company, suffered
no casualties in the attack but briefly caught fire and its engine
room was flooded, according to gulf-based shipping executives, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, and Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence
Unit in London.
   The ship was towed to Bahrain overnight.

   In a region where concern about terrorism
is high and the profile of American military personnel low, U.S.
experts investigating the shooting down of an Iranian airliner are
silent and nearly invisible.
   Their daily travels between a Manama hotel and two U.S. warships
anchored off Bahrain are quick and discreet. They wear civilian
clothes while ashore, as do other U.S. military personnel in the
security-conscious Arab countries of the Persian Gulf.
   The six-man team arrived July 5 on a special U.S. military
aircraft, two days after the Iran Air Airbus A300 was shot down by
the missile cruiser USS Vincennes, which mistook it for an Iranian
F-14 fighter. All 290 people aboard were killed.
   A 15-day period allowed for completion of the report is more
than half gone but officials at U.S. Central Command headquarters
in Tampa, Fla., say it can be extended if Rear Adm. William M.
Fogarty, the team leader, decides more time is needed.
   The investigators received an analysis of the Vincennes computer
tapes Tuesday, but U.S. officials would not say what the analysis
revealed about the performance of the billion-dollar cruiser's
Aegis air-defense system.
   Britain said Wednesday its tapes of distress frequencies were
being provided. The Americans were understood to have requested
similar data from the Italians, who like the British had a warship
in the area, and from air traffic control in Dubai, the destination
of Iran Air flight 655.
   One U.S. official said the team is trying to collect ``anything
and everything'' that might help reconstruct the incident,
beginning with a skirmish between the Vincennes and Iranian
speedboats less than an hour earlier.
   Fogarty, 52, is a former battleship commander who now is
director of plans and policy at Central Command, the administrative
headquarters for U.S. military activities in the Middle East and
the gulf region.
   Navy spokesmen have refused to identify the others, citing
security considerations, except to say one is a lawyer and the rest
are technical experts. They are seen only rarely and ignore all
questions.
   One member of the team, Capt. John J. Kieley III, even refused
at first to acknowledge two journalists he knew months ago while
serving a tour in the gulf as skipper of the missile frigate Reuben
James.
   He exchanged brief pleasantries with the two a day later, but
said nothing about the investigation. He now is a Pentagon staff
officer.
   Navy spokesmen will say only that the investigation ``is
continuing.''
   The team's first action was to take depositions from Capt. Will
C. Rogers III, commander of the Vincennes, and other officers of
the three U.S. warships that were in the area when the Iranian
plane was shot down.
   One U.S. military official said the actions of ships' officers
at the scene might be easily explained and the mystery of the
destruction of Iran Air flight 655 probably lies mainly in the
technical data, including the ``black box'' fight recorder. Iran
says it has not been found.
   U.S. officials in Washington said the combat information center
on the Vincennes received a confusing mixture of identification
signals, on both military and civilian channels, indicating the
Airbus was an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   They say Rogers fired his missiles at virtually the last
possible moment, after failing repeatedly to establish radio
contact with the aircraft on both military and civilian frequencies.
   Most of the investigation has been conducted on the Navy's gulf
flagship, the Coronado, and on the Vincennes. The 9,600-ton missile
cruiser has been anchored off Bahrain for a week, barely visible
from shore in the haze.
   An American who visited the Vincennes last week said ``nobody
talks about'' the Airbus, at least when outsiders are aboard.
   The other two ships in the area at the time, the frigate Elmer
Montgomery and the missile frigate John H. Sides, were in port in
Manama for the first few days of the investigation but have
returned to duty.
   Both ships are said to have evidence indicating the jetliner was
at about 12,000 feet and possibly climbing, rather than descending
from 9,000 to 7,800 feet as the Vincennes believed.
   Officials refused to say Wednesday whether there had been
contact between the United States and Iran in connection with the
investigation. ``If that was deemed appropriate, it would be done
through appropriate channels,'' a Central Command spokesman said.

   A 40-ton rocket carrying a research
satellite plunged into the sea minutes after takeoff Wednesday,
scientists said. It was India's second launch failure in 15 months.
   The rocket's first-stage motor apparently malfuctioned shortly
after the rocket, the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV),
blasted off at 2:28 p.m. from Sriharikota Island, 1,100 miles
southeast of New Delhi, according to a scientist at the launch site.
   The scientist, who spoke on condition of anomymity, said contact
with the rocket was lost 1 minute and 15 seconds after takeoff. The
United News of India news agency said the rocket crashed into the
Indian Ocean 4 minutes and 10 seconds after the launch.
   The chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization in New
Delhi, U.R. Rao, was quoted as saying the exact cause of the launch
failure had not been determined.
   It was the second failed Indian space mission since another
rocket from the same ASLV series plunged into the Bay of Bengal in
March 1987, when its first-stage motor failed to ignite minutes
after launching.
   The scientist at the launch site said the first-stage motor in
Wednesday's launch ignited, but ``something went wrong after that.''
   The rocket carried a 330-pound satellite designed to take
three-dimensional photographs of Earth and conduct experiments on
the origins of gamma rays. The satellite was to enter an orbit 240
miles above Earth, scientists said.
   The failure of the mission comes amid reports that India could
develop the ASLV rocket as a launch vehicle for nuclear weapons.
   According to Anthony H. Cordesman, a U.S. military analyst, the
rocket, with the addition of a heat shield and a guidance system,
could deploy intermediate-range ballistic missiles or IRBM.
   ``The Indians themselves have estimated that they could have an
operational, nuclear-armed IRBM by 1989,'' Cordesman said in a
published report.
   India exploded an atomic device in 1974, but the government says
its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
   India last successfully launched a satellite on April 17, 1983.
   Since 1980, it has launched two other satellites, while three
other missions failed, including the first ASLV launch.
   Six Indian-made satellites have been sent into orbit by space
agencies in the Soviet Union, United States and Europe.
   On Tuesday, the Soviet Union successfully launched the second of
two space probes to explore Mars and help prepare for a manned
flight to the red planet.

<DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's is opening restaurants in
hospitals in what one doctor suggests is an invitation to a Big Mac
heart attack. But a hospital spokesman argues the food ``hasn't
killed anyone yet.''
   The fast food chain has opened eight such restaurants
nationwide. One more is under construction at Dayton Children's
Hospital in Ohio, and four are under contract, said Steven Roth,
McDonald's manager of hospital development.
   Dr. Michael Goldblatt, McDonald's staff nutritionist, said the
restaurants supplement hospitals' regular food services and are
aimed at staff and visitors, not patients.
   ``Yeah, the sodium is high in some of the food, but they also
have salads and salt-free french fries. It's not going to kill you.
It hasn't killed anyone yet,'' said John Head, spokesman at Denver
General Hospital, where a McDonald's opened last month.
   McDonald's spokesman John Onoda said the hospital restaurants
are no different than the chain's setups in museums, airports and
train stations. Burger King and Wendy's also have opened
restaurants in hospitals.
   ``McDonald's will open up where people go, where people are,''
he said Monday in an interview at the chain's headquarters in Oak
Brook, a Chicago suburb.
   ``The whole idea is ridiculous,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the
Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Washington-based consumer
advocacy group.
   ``What better way to create new patients than to sell food which
significantly increases the risk of coronary artery disease and
heart attacks?'' he wrote in a group newsletter in an article
headlined ``Big Mac (Heart) Attack.''
   ``It is not unlike, in my view, the idea of hospitals selling
cigarettes,'' Wolfe said Monday.
   The American Hospital Association and the American Medical
Association declined comment. A spokesman for American Heart
Association took issue with the practice.
   ``We feel hospitals should provide leadership in health care,''
said spokesman Howard Lewis. ``They're not giving the leadership
with this move to McDonald's, because of the image of McDonald's
and other fast food companies _ the image of food that is high in
cholesterol, high in fat and high in salt, which are three areas
we're very concerned about.''
   The heart association's guidelines urge people to limit intake
of fats, especially saturated fats, sodium and cholesterol.
   In announcing those guidelines in 1986, Dr. W. Virgil Brown, a
former chairman of the committee that drafted them, said,
``Hamburgers are far and away the No. 1 cholesterol problem in the
country.''
   ``As far as quality goes, McDonald's uses the finest-quality
ingredients,'' Goldblatt said. ``Our food is really no different
than the kind of food you consume at home.
   ``Our hamburgers contain no more than 22.5 percent fat. ... The
restaurants offer food from the four food groups, even with the
addition of salads,'' he said. ``It's possible to get a very light
nutritious meal as well.''
   Wendy's International Inc. opened a restaurant in 1985 at the
Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, said spokeswoman Sue Willis.
   Burger King Corp. last summer opened restaurants at Jewish
Hospital in Louisville, Ky., and Harris County Hospital in Fort
Worth, Texas, said a spokesman, Tim Hermeling.
   ``The field of non-traditional sites, like hospitals, is
something Burger King is very interested in,'' he said.
   For hospitals, sagging revenue from regular in-house restaurants
led some to turn to Big Macs. Other said they needed a food carrier
that could handle high volume quickly and efficiently.
   Onoda would not discuss revenues from the restaurants except to
say they are doing ``very well.'' Denver General said it expects
the restaurant to bring the hospital $150,000 a year in rent and a
percentage of the receipts.
   In Minneapolis, John Najarian, a nationally known transplant
physician, surprised some nutritionists by opening a fast-food
restaurant Tuesday featuring fried foods that have been linked to
heart disease.
   ``It wouldn't be like backing a cigarette company or something
like that,'' said Najarian. ``Today, the important thing is to get
away from beef and red meat. So what we stress, as physicians, is
chicken and fish. ... It's a heck of a lot better than Burger King
or Wendy's.''

   A previously unknown group linked with
Palestinians said Wednesday it was behind the terrorist raid on a
Greek cruise ship. At the same time, the PLO strongly condemned the
attack.
   A statement signed ``The Organization of the Martyrs of the
Popular Revolution in Palestine'' claimed responsibility for
Monday's attack on the City of Poros cruise ship. In a separate
statement, the group said it also blew up a car in port hours
before the ship attack.
   The statements, delivered to a Western news agency in west
Beirut, were type-written in Arabic on paper that carried no
letterhead, unlike the usual communiques from Palestinian groups.
There was no way to authenticate the claims.
   Meanwhile, in Baghdad, Iraq, Bassam Abu Sharif, spokesman for
PLO chief Yasser Arafat, declared:
   ``The Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian
people, being themselves victims of state-organized terrorism,
strongly condemn this criminal attack on the Greek ship and the car
bombing...
   ``Greece is a country known for its friendly attitudes toward
the Palestinian cause, and we cannot but condemn such attacks,'' he
added.
   One statement signed by The Organization of the Martyrs of the
Popular Revolution in Palestine said the attack on the ship, in
which nine people died, was carried out ``in retaliation for the
escalation in the operations of murder and extermination by the
murderous Zionist-American gangs in Palestine, Lebanon, the gulf
and all over the world.''

   The government today ordered an immediate
trial for a Palestinian wanted in the United States whose detention
may have provoked a cruise ship massacre.
   Mohammed Rashid, 34, was taken from Korydallos Prison to the
Athens Misdemeanors Court for trial on charges of entering Greece
on a forged passport. He is wanted in the United States for
allegedly planting a bomb on a Pan Am jetliner in 1982 that killed
one person and injured 15.
   Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas overruled a decision
for a two-week postponement of the hearing, but the court ordered
the hearing postponed until Thursday because the defense lawyer and
the interpreter were unavailable.
   Rashid told reporters he wasn't involved in the Pan Am bombing.
   ``The Americans can say what they like, I had nothing to do with
it. I'm a Palestinian fighter, but the Palestinians are only
fighting inside the occupied territories, not everywhere,'' he said
in court before the delay was announced.
   The Palestinian, surrounded by police officers armed with
automatic weapons, claimed the cruise ship attack was ``an American
operation...to distract attention from the shooting down of the
Iranian plane and the Palestinian uprising.''
   ``They also want to provide trouble for Greece,'' he said before
being returned to jail.
   Greek authorities say they believe the terrorists who attacked
the City of Poros cruise ship on Monday may have intended to hijack
the vessel and force Rashid's release.
   A coroner said today nine people died when terrorists opened
fire with automatic weapons and exploded hand grenades on the Greek
ship. Ninety-eight people were injured.
   Government spokesman Telemachos Hytiris said Greece ``intends to
go ahead immediately with the procedures for the (Rashid) trial,
regardless of the strike.'' The hearing was initially postponed
because of a strike by prison guards.
   Hytiris said Rashid would have to serve his Greek sentence
before he can be extradited to the United States. Rashid, 34, was
arrested June 1 at Athens Airport after a tip from the U.S. Embassy.
   Security sources said the ship attack may have been a bungled
attempt by pro-Iranian Arabs to hijack the City of Poros, which was
carrying 471 tourists on a one-day cruise through the Greek islands.
   Iran denied involvement in the attack, in which the terrorists
opened fire with automatic weapons and hurled grenades, starting a
fire that brought the ship's sun deck crashing down on passengers.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
This morning, Radio France-Inter in Paris reported an anonymous
caller said in a rambling conversation that the pro-Iranian group
Islamic Jihad carried out the attack to avenge the U.S. downing of
an Iranian passenger plane.
   Radio France-Inter said the man spoke French with a Lebanese
accent and said he was calling from Cairo. The claim could not be
authenticated, the radio said. Islamic Jihad, a Shiite Moslem group
that holds foreign hostages in Lebanon, previously has
authenticated its statements with a photograph of a hostage.
   Also today, a previously unknown group, The Organization of the
Martyrs of the Popular Revolution in Palestine, said it was behind
the ship attack. The claim, which could not be authenticated, was
made in a statement delivered to a news agency in Beirut. At the
same time, the Palestine Liberation Organization issued a statement
condemning the attack on the ship.
   Public Order Minister Anastasios Sehiotis on Tuesday released
photographs of three men and a woman he said were involved in the
attack. He linked the group with an explosion that killed two men
in a car near the liner's home dock about six hours before the ship
attack.
   Police speculated that automatic weapons, grenades and
explosives found in the car were intended for hijacking the cruise
ship.
   ``We think they (the terrorists) found out about the car
explosion and decided to shoot up the ship,'' said a harbor officer.
   Sehiotis said two Lebanese men were being sought by police in
connection with the car explosion. He identified them as Hamoud
Abdul Hamid, 36, the man who rented the car, and Mohammed Zozad,
21, recognized by survivors as one of the terrorists aboard the
ship.
   Coroner Manolis Nonas said nine people died in the attack on the
ship. Earlier reports said up to 11 people were killed. Nonas said
only three had been identified. They were Antonis Demaizis, the
ship's first mate, Klaus Johan Grabas, 33, a Danish tourist, and
Irene Kack, 55, a Swedish tourist.
   Greek state-run TV and radio said an American, identified
phonetically as either Carl Johns or Charles Dome, was killed, but
the U.S. Embassy said it was unaware of any such person.
   The Merchant Marine Ministry said 98 people were wounded.
   A Health Ministry official said 18 foreigners were still in
Athens hospitals. He said they were 12 French citizens, two Swedes,
two Danes, one described as Scandinavian and a 5-year-old Egyptian
girl.
   Several injured French tourists were flown to France for
treatment.
   Initial police reports based on fragmentary witness accounts
said the terrorists escaped in a waiting speedboat.
   But the harbor officer and several survivors said the terrorists
jumped off the burning ship into the sea and were picked up by
rescue boats that rushed to the scene.
   Some survivors said the commando team consisted of two men and
two women. Others said there were two men and one woman.
   The senior harbor officer said authorities believe there were
two women, one with a Moroccan passport and the other with a French
passport.

<HEAD>Paul Brountas: Dukakis' Friend and Adviser</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Brountas _ confidant and adviser to
Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis _ likes to tell a story
about his three brothers, all of them one-time mayors of Bangor,
Maine.
   The local newspaper once photographed the three Mayors Brountas
and ran this caption beneath: ``They also have a brother Paul.''
   Paul P. Brountas has gained a little stature of his own since
then.
   The prominent Boston lawyer led Dukakis' search for a vice
presidential running mate, and Dukakis thanked him publicly on
Tuesday and recalled their days in law school with Paul Sarbanes,
now a U.S. senator from Maryland.
   ``Little could the Greek troika in the class of 1960 at Harvard
Law School possibly imagine that Dukakis would be the Democratic
nominee for president, Sarbanes would be a Democrat from Maryland
in the U.S. Senate, and our counselor and adviser and friend would
not only be the chairman of our cmapaign committee but the person
who managed this wonderful process which has brought us Lloyd
Bentsen,'' Dukakis told a news conference in Boston.
   Brountas, 56, is confidant and gray eminence aboard Dukakis'
campaign plane _ and, many believe, the most likely candidate for
attorney general or White House counselor should Dukakis win in
November.
   ``I really haven't allowed myself to think about it,'' Brountas
says of that talk. ``There's a lot of attraction to it, but there's
also a lot of attraction to what I have been doing.
   ``I haven't even thought about it _ that's the most dangerous
thing you can do.''
   It was Brountas who conducted final interviews with Jesse
Jackson and other potential vice presidential candidates and
presented background findings to Dukakis. In a late-night meeting
Monday at Dukakis' home, Brountas recommended the selection of
Bentsen _ and Dukakis agreed.
   Brountas, 56, a partner in the large and successful law firm of
Hale and Dorr, is like Dukakis in many ways, not the least of which
is his careful, close-to-the-vest demeanor.
   Like the Massachusetts governor, Brountas is the son of Greek
immigrants. He grew up in Bangor, Maine, where his father ran a
small restaurant. He graduated from Bowdoin College and attended
Oxford as a Marshall Scholar before entering Harvard.
   ``I was kind of a hick from Maine,'' Brountas said. ``I hadn't
been out of the state much.''
   But Brountas has pursued politics in his own quiet and
successful way.
   Comfortable in his law practice, Brountas watched the chaotic
1968 Democratic National Convention that nominated Hubert Humphrey
for president and Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie as vice president. On a
whim, Brountas wrote a letter to Muskie volunteering his help.
   ``I did something fairly impulsive for me and said, if nobody
else is going to help, I would,'' Brountas recalled in a recent
interview. ``I never expected to hear from him.''
   But he did. Muskie invited him on a campaign trip, and soon he
was a senior adviser to the vice presidential nominee. Four years
later he was an adviser for Muskie's ill-fated presidential
campaign.
   Brountas has been involved in all of Dukakis' major campaigns,
usually as chairman, including the 1978 Democratic primary when
Dukakis lost to Ed King _ a setback that Brountas says helped
Dukakis in the long-run by teaching him to listen.
   The two became friends at Harvard. After graduating and taking
their bar exams, the two loaded up Brountas' Volkswagen Karmann
Ghia and headed to Los Angeles, where John F. Kennedy was nominated
for the presidency.
   ``We were fairly straight guys, but we would look for the
attractive young ladies to have drinks with,'' Brountas said.
   They stopped in Las Vegas, where they slept in a park, and
Dukakis reluctantly played the slot machines. He won a $30 jackpot
on his first try, then quit. They went to San Francisco and Mexico,
as well.
   ``We talked a lot about what we were going to do,'' Brountas
recalled. ``I was going to go to Maine and run for governor.''
   But Brountas' plans changed. He found he liked practicing law,
and it occurred to him that predominantly Republican Maine might
not elect him.
   ``I thought, I can get involved at a different level,'' he said.
   In Boston, Brountas developed a practice specializing in the
emerging high-technology and computer companies that have led the
region's economic boom. He provides business as well as legal
advice, sometimes representing companies and sometimes the venture
capitalists, and has guided them through rapid growth, mergers,
acquisitions and the sometimes hugely profitable initial public
stock offerings.
   ``It's very satisfying because you grow with the companies,''
Brountas said.
   He has also been an important link for Dukakis to business
leaders in the state.
   Brountas is fond of saying he has quit practicing law, now that
his time is fully occupied by Dukakis' presidential bid.
   It was Brountas who quided the selection of Susan Estrich as
campaign manager when Dukakis' trusted aide John Sasso was forced
to resign in controversy over the seeming sabatoge of rival Joseph
Biden's campaign.

<HEAD>U.S. To Scrutinize Hiring of Women in Construction, Aerospace Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal task force will study why such a low
percentage of women hold jobs in the construction and aerospace
industries, U.S. Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said Wednesday.
   ``The problems women may have in securing jobs traditionally
held by men is an issue of great interest to me,'' Ms. McLaughlin
said at a news conference.
   The task force is to begin its review by the end of the month
and complete it within a few months, she said. The panel will
determine female representation in the two industries and whether
there are overt or subtle pressures against hiring or promoting
women, Ms. McLaughlin said.
   Women filled about 1.2 percent of construction jobs in 1980,
according to census figures that year, when government and industry
set goals to increase the proportion to 6.9 percent over the next
few years, said Labor Department aide Jerry Blakemore. So far, he
said, women's representation in contruction jobs has improved only
to about 2 percent.
   The female proportion of aerospace workers has been higher _
about 19 percent to 26 percent, he said, but labor officials
consider it still too low.
   According to Ms. McLaughlin, ``If we find there are problems, we
will enforce the prohibition against sex discrimination by
government contractors and the requirements that they take
affirmative action.
   ``In addition, we will see whether we can improve the Labor
Department's compliance and review procedures. And we will develop
recommendations on how to increase opportunities for women in these
non-traditional jobs,'' she said.
   Ms. McLaughlin was in Chicago to attend a briefing with business
and government leaders concerned about affordable child care for
working mothers.
   Serving on the task force will be representatives of the
solicitor's office of the Labor Department, the Office of Federal
Contract Compliance, which administers federal anti-discrimination
guidelines for government contractors, and the federal Bureau of
Apprenticeship and Training, Ms. McLaughlin said.

   The Prime Minister of Kuwait said Wednesday
that Secretary of State George P. Shultz will make a fifth trip to
the Middle East this year to push his plan for Arab-Israeli
negotiations.
   Sheik Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah wished Shultz well and joined
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as the only Arab leaders to openly
endorse the plan.
   However, the prime minister called also for establishment of a
Palestinian state and for participation of the Palestine Liberation
Organization in the negotiations.
   Sheik Saad, who is also crown prince of the Persian Gulf
country, said the continued ``uprising'' of Palestinian Arabs on
the Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza was ``a strong exhibition of
the determination of the Palestinians to regain their freedom.''
   About 200 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in
clashes since last December.
   Shultz's plan does not call for a Palestinian state, nor for PLO
participation in the talks unless it recognizes Israel's right to
exist and disavows terrorism.
   He has made four trips to the Middle East this year to try to
promote negotiations between Israel and a mixed delegation of
Jordanians and Palestinians and run into resistance from Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, King Hussein of Jordan and the PLO.
   Shamir refused to participate in a peace conference held partly
under Soviet auspices, Hussein wanted a guarantee that Israel would
relinquish the West Bank and Gaza, and the PLO barred Palestinians
from meeting with Shultz.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said she knew of
``no plans'' for Shultz to return to the region. And yet, she
recalled ``the secretary has always said that he would be available
to return to the Middle East if it would be useful in pursuit of
the peace initiative.''
   Sheik Saad, on a week-long visit here, met on Tuesday with
President Reagan and on Monday with Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci and Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead.
   Shultz is o a trip to the Far East. He plans to go to Central
America and South America in early August, attend the Republican
national convention in mid-month and take a vacation before Labor
Day. He would then have until January to try to his hand at
``shuttle diplomacy'' again.
   Sheik Saad, in a speech and a press conference, renewed Kuwait's
request for U.S. air-to-ground Maverick missiles as part of a $1.8
billion arms purchase from the United States that would include 40
F-18 jet fighter planes.
   The Senate has voted to block the Mavericks, viewing them as a
potential threat to Israel's security. Sheik Saad said Kuwait was
``a peace-loving country'' and wanted the arms for self-defense.
   ``It doesn't mean we intend to invade any other country,'' the
Arab leader said.
   Over the weekend, Kuwait annouced an arms deal with the Soviet
Union. ``So,'' Sheik Saad said, ``don't be surprised when you read
tomorrow or next week or next month that Kuwait also has bought
military equipment from Moscow, or Britain or France.''
   He scheduled meetings with members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee to try to reverse the opposition to the
Mavericks.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives
are expected to retain Kensington, a district of both princes and
paupers, in a by-election Thursday that will give her radical new
economic plan its first electoral test.
   The vote in the 3-square-mile west London district coincides
with declining ratings for the opposition Labor Party and a new
crisis over its anti-nuclear policy, which should help the
conservatives hold their thin majority.
   Party leader Neil Kinnock, who campaigned personally in
Kensington before leaving on a trip to southern Africa, has renewed
warnings to Labor's left-wing dissidents that the party must
moderate its policies or risk its fourth successive defeat in the
next general election.
   ``It is the realism that says when you have been defeated three
times, then it is your duty to look at yourselves,'' Kinnock said
recently of the review he has orderd of party policy.
   Mrs. Thatcher has introduced laws to impose an unpopular new
property tax, shaken up the welfare system and ordered a review of
the cherished National Health Service in the next stage of her
right-wing revolution.
   Conservatives kept the seat in Kensington, which has 48,500
voters, with a majority of 4,500 in June 1987, when Mrs. Thatcher
won her third term. It is the first House of Commons constituency
to fall vacant.
   The district is among the most starkly divided in Britain. In
its southern part are rows of elegant period houses belonging to
some of the nation's wealthiest people.
   Kensington Palace is London home to Prince Charles and Princess
Diana. Other royals, including Charles's aunt, Princess Margaret,
and his cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, have apartments in the
palace.
   North Kensington, full of immigrants, is characterized by shabby
streets of state-subsidized housing.
   Labor has plunged in national polls from a narrow lead in April
to 10 points behind in the lastest survey by the Market and Opinion
Research Institute.
   Bookmakers rate Conservative Dudley Fishburn, a former
journalist for The Economist weekly magazine, a 5-1 favorite to win
Kensington. His Labor opponent is Ann Holmes.
   The by-election was made necessary by the death in November of
Sir Brandon Rhys Williams, a Conservative who represented the
constituency for 20 years.

   A ferry boat hit another vessel and
capsized in the dark, spilling 27 gamblers and casino workers into
the chilly, swift-flowing Colorado River, authorities said.
   The victims were pulled safely from the river by onlookers and
boaters while others combed the river's edge with flashlights. One
rescuer described Tuesday night's ordeal as ``a lot of screaming
and yelling.''
   The 27 victims were treated for minor injuries, shock and
hypothermia, said Joe Harrington, spokesman for Community Hospital
in Bullhead City, Ariz., across the river from this gaming resort.
Two people remained hospitalized Wednesday.
   The 25-foot pontoon ferry boat lost power while pulling away
from the Nevada side of the river about 9:30 p.m. It crashed into
an unoccupied 60-foot pleasure boat that was docked at the
Edgewater Hotel, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police.
   The ferry is one of many that carries gamblers and casino
workers between Bullhead City on the river's eastern shore and
Laughlin, 100 yards away on the western shore. Laughlin is 90 miles
southwest of Las Vegas.
   The 27 people were dumped into about 15 feet of 52-degree water.
Two men and two women were pulled from the river some distance away
by three people who had spent the evening fishing downstream.
   ``There was a lot of screaming and yelling and a lot of people
hanging off the boat,'' said Laughlin resident Frank Marini, who
had just finished a night of fishing with two friends. ``My stomach
was in knots. I didn't want to pull up any dead bodies.''
   Emergency helicopters from Las Vegas and Arizona and personnel
from the Metro search and rescue unit joined U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation and state Department of Wildlife and Fish and Game
personnel in searching for the passengers.
   Authorities initially reported that two people had died and 10
were missing. They later revised the figures, saying those reported
missing were determined to have walked away from the accident, and
that there were no deaths.
   The ferry is one of several owned by the Colorado Belle and
Edgewater hotel-casinos, according to Scott Menke, assistant
manager of the Edgewater. The boats make about 12 runs an hour.

   County Council members in a prime
tobacco-growing region have given initial approval to an ordinance
that would ban smoking in county-owned buildings.
   Under the plan proposed by Councilman Hughey Walker, who calls
it a Clean Indoor Air Ordinance, all cigarette, pipe and cigar
smoking would be banned in county-owned buildings, except in
designated smoking areas.
   County Council voted 6-1 Tuesday night to approve the ordinance
on first reading. The ordinance, which calls for violators to be
fined up to $200, must pass second and third readings before it
becomes law.
   Councilman H.E. Hemingway, a tobacco warehouse owner and the

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, promising to
defend ``the honor of the United States,'' will present the U.S.
case when the U.N. Security Council meets Thursday to debate the
American destruction of an Iranian airliner carrying 290 people.
   The White House said Wednesday that President Reagan's selection
of Bush ``reflects the importance of the issues at stake.''
   It also guarantees a high-profile platform for Bush, who is
certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, at a time when
the Democrats are preparing to install Michael Dukakis as their
presidential candidate.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater insisted that political
factors were not involved in the choice of Bush.
   Iran, which has boycotted the Security Council since the
Iran-Iraq war began in 1980, is coming back to the world
organization to seek a resolution that would condemn, or at least
deplore, the downing of the Iranian civilian airliner over the
Persian Gulf by the U.S. cruiser Vincennes.
   The vice president, at a political appearance before a farm
group, said, ``I can't wait to get up there to defend the policy of
the United States government.''
   Bush was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1971 to
1973, and this is believed to be his first U.N. speech since then.
U.N. officials said that no U.S. vice president had addressed the
council in recent memory.
   Previewing his remarks, Bush said, ``It's the free world's case.
And the efforts to second-guess the captain of that ship will be
rebuffed. And what I'm going to say is a matter that concerns all
Americans, whatever line of work you engage in.
   ``The honor of the United States,'' Bush continued. ``To see
this second-guessing going on, to suggest that the United States
was wrong, that this captain was wrong _ his ship under fire, seven
warnings and him trying to protect the lives of these American
kids.''
   The U.S. ship, under attack by Iranian speedboats at the time,,
claimed it mistook the airliner for an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Discussing Bush's role, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the vice president ``will demonstrate to the Security Council
and the world the U.S. concern on this matter, the seriousness with
which we take it and our dedication to steps to try to end the
Iran-Iraq war.
   ``That is our motivation.''
   Denying any political motivation in Bush's assignment, Fitzwater
said, ``Let's deal with the real question here. The issue is that
we believe that this is a matter of the highest importance to the
United States and to the world.''
   ``That is our motivation in the sense that the vice president
can make these points forcefully and dramatically,'' he said. ``The
vice president does not normally appear before the United Nations
Security Council and in this way we can again highlight our
previously stated position.''
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati will be the first
speaker before the Security Council, and Bush is expected to be the
second.
   Diplomatic observers at the U.N. said Bush's appearance would be
a major political gesture of goodwill and sincerity. They said his
presence and his statements also could signal to Iran that the
United States is receptive to a dialogue between the two
governments, which have no diplomatic ties.
   The council meeting, originally set for Tuesday, was postponed
until Thursday because Iran was unable to get a majority on the
15-member council to condemn the United States and demand its
withdrawal from the Persian Gulf.
   But diplomatic sources also said the U.S. announcement of
compensation and its expression of regret had pre-empted Iran,
which had sought to use the forum to denounce the United States.
   The United States was expected to veto any resolution condemning
the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Task Force Probing Green River Serial Murders Won't Be Reduced For
Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of officers investigating the case of
the Green River killer, who is blamed for the deaths of up to 48
women, will be reduced if no new developments arise within the next
year, an official said Wednesday.
   King County Executive Tim Hill said the 19 officers on the Green
River Task Force will remain at least until the current fiscal year
ends in June 1989.
   ``There is not going to be a reduction this year,'' Hill said.
   The serial killer is officially blamed for the deaths of as many
as 48 young women, many of them prostitutes, between the summer of
1982 and early 1984. Four victims were found in Oregon, but the
killer has operated primarily in the Puget Sound area.
   Forty are known dead and the task force had blamed the killer
for the disappearances of eight missing women.
   Sheriff James Montgomery said $13 million has been spent since
the task force was formed after the first bodies were found. The
budget for the current fiscal year for the officers and four staff
members is about $1 million.
   The force at one time numbered nearly 60.
   Montgomery also said police are investigating similarities
between the Green River deaths and a case in San Diego, Calif., in
which 32 young women have been killed. Those killings started
shortly after the Seattle-area slayings ended in early 1984.
   In a June 30 memo to Hill, Montgomery said the timing of the
killings in the two cases was ``very significant,'' and called the
slayings in the two states ``almost a mirror image'' of each other.
   He told reporters Wednesday there also were many differences.
   Hill and Montgomery said the King County task force would
cooperate fully with San Diego authorities.

   Damages from a fire that destroyed a
520,000-square-foot supermarket chain warehouse could reach $60
million, firefighters said.
   Workers at the Safeway warehouse told firefighters they believe
the building was worth about $30 million and the groceries it
contained were worth $30 million more, said David Howard, the
city's acting fire marshal.
   Company officials said they were still adding up the damage. The
company has not decided whether it will rebuild the warehouse in
the same place, spokesman Louie Gonzalez said.
   The fire could be seen in San Francisco, 15 miles to the
southwest, Monday night and early Tuesday.
   The warehouse was part of a million-square-foot distribution
complex that supplies more than 200 Safeway stores. About 400
people worked there.
   Firefighters said they believe the blaze started when a worker
driving a forklift accidentally ran into an overhanging halogen
light. The impact sent a a shower of sparks down onto a
15-foot-high stack of cardboard boxes filled with toilet paper,
Howard said.

   The 19-week scriptwriters' strike is severely
damaging the major networks, but producers must hold the line
against rising costs, the top ABC and NBC bosses said.
   ``The absence of new fall programs is extremely negative to us
at a time when cable is gaining,'' said NBC President Robert C.
Wright.

Cities@ABC Chairman Thomas S. Murphy, referring to the company's

   Wright and Murphy were responding to a Los Angeles Times request
for their views on the Writers Guild of America strike. CBS
President Laurence A. Tisch did not respond to the inquiry, the
Times reported Wednesday.
   ``The damage is both short-term and long-term,'' said Wright,
noting that his No. 1-rated network has the most to lose.
   He said the network had an unprecedented opportunity to use its
Olympics and World Series coverage to promote its fall lineup.
   The 9,000 film and TV writers went on strike March 7 over
creative control and residuals from reruns and overseas broadcasts.
   The executives are backing the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers position, even refusing to buy new programs
from independent production companies that sign interim contracts
with the union.
   ``It isn't just the increases in program costs that disturb me.
It's the fundamentally high cost of programming. This is very, very
expensive,'' Wright said.
   ``There's no more water in the mop,'' said Murphy.
   The strike cut last season short and suspended all work on this
fall's shows. The networks have announced plans to fill their
prime-time schedules using specials, foreign scripts, movies and
remakes of old series.
   ``For a number of shows that were important to us for the fall,
it's already too late. We already missed them,'' Wright said.

   The designated Democratic ticket of Michael
Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen got a cool reception today from the
NAACP, many of whose members had hoped the vice-presidential
nomination would go to Jesse Jackson.
   There was only scattered applause from delegates to the annual
convention of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People when the Massachusetts governor and the Texas
senator entered the crowded ballroom.
   It was in marked contrast to the rousing scene Tuesday night
when Jackson addressed the same group.
   In fact, the first burst of enthusiasm from the audience came as
NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks, who introduced Dukakis,
turned to the governor and said, ``You know, knowing Jesse has been
good for you.''
   The audience applauded, and Dukakis smiled.
   In his speech, Dukakis promised that as president his ``door is
going to be open.''
   Then he went on, ``I've learned a lot from Jesse and I've
learned a lot from you.''
   Bentsen followed Dukakis to the podium and said, ``There can be
no question where a Dukakis-Bentsen administration would stand on
the important civil rights issues of the day.''
   ``Mike Dukakis and I are committed to making a difference for
America,'' Bentsen said.
   Some delegates booed when Dukakis turned the microphone over to
Bentsen, and Hooks jumped in to ask the delegates for a warmer
welcome. Once again, the loudest applause came when Hooks referred
to Jackson. Hooks looked at Bentsen and said he had ``a tough act
to follow. ... Many of our delegates, a you know, wanted to see
Jesse in this position.''
   At that point delegates stood and cheered and applauded.
   ``I sympathize with you,'' said Hooks.
   Before Dukakis entered the room, Hooks told delegates to tear up
hand-lettered signs many were carrying that read, ``Jesse is
qualified'' and ``What's wrong with Jesse?''
   ``Those of you who brought those signs, tear them up and act
your age,'' said Hooks.
   The signs reflected disappointment that Dukakis had passed over
Jackson in his search for a running mate. Several delegates
expressed disgruntlement less over the fact Jackson wasn't chosen
as over the fact Dukakis did not notify him in advance of te
selection of Bentsen.
   Jackson first learned of the selection of Bentsen from reporters
when he flew in to Washington's National Airport.
   At a news conference this afternoon, Dukakis explained that he
had tried to reach Jackson by telephone to tell him of Bentsen's
selection, but couldn't reach him at first. When he did reach
Jackson, Dukakis said he told Jackson he was sorry to have missed
him on the first call.
   In any case, Dukakis said, ``I made my choice and I'm very happy
with that choice, and I think most Democrats across the country
are.''
   As for Jackson, Dukakis said, ``I want Jesse Jackson to be
deeply involved in this campaign as a party leader.''
   While the response at the NAACP convention was tepid, Dukakis
and Bentsen got a somewhat better welcome today before the
Congressional Black Caucus, and a rousing reception at a separate
session of House Democrats.
   ``He sent one single message,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``He
wants to work with us and reach out to us. That's what the Congress
wants to hear.''
   Among those greeting the two men as they arrived for a private
meeting with House Democrats was Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., the Budget
Commitee chairman and a senior leader among black House members.
Gray said he had been disappointed that Jackson was not the choice
for No. 2.
   ``But it's been made, and I plan to support the ticket,'' Gray
said.
   Gray said the two men will have to begin talking about issues of
concern to blacks if they want to unite minority voters behind the
campaign. ``We are going to be concerned about long-term policy _
civil rights ... human investment,'' he said.
   Dukakis and Bentsen also met for about 45 minutes with members
of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``It went well,'' Bentsen said
as he emerged, and the comments of black House members generally
reflected that assessment.
   ``Lots of fences have been mended,'' said caucus chairman Rep.
Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif. ``We had a very fruitful discussion about
the convention, the campaign and the presidency.''
   ``It's a strong ticket. It's a winning ticket,'' said Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., adding: ``It was very friendly in the room.''
   Members said they still planned to remain committed to Jackson
on the first ballot at next week's convention in Atlanta.
   Another member of the caucus said he believed the ticket has its
work cut out to try to repair damage.
   ``I frankly think he's made life a lot more difficult for
himself and will have to work a lot harder,'' Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., said of Dukakis.
   Asked at a news conference Tuesday if he were angry at being
passed over, Jackson replied: ``No, I'm too controlled, I'm too
clear, I'm too mature to be angry. I'm focused on what we must do
to keep hope alive...''
   Jackson, who spokeby availability of workforce, unionization,
workers' compensation insurance levels and productivity.
   Education, finishing in the No. 15 spot, was the highest-ranked
among the so-called ``quality-of-life'' factors. Cost of living,
health care and transportation occupied the bottom three places on
the manufacturers' lists.
   ``This is a cost-oriented study, make no mistake about it,''
said Selwyn Price, the Grant Thornton partner in charge of the
study. ``Obviously to compete in a global environment, costs have
to be contained.
   ``The competition is no longer between New Hampshire and South
Dakota, it's between New Hampshire and Taiwan and South Dakota and
Taiwan,'' he added.
   States where total employment in manufacturing exceeded the
national average of 17 percent or where manufacturing shipments
exceeded the national average in dollar terms were considered
``intensive.''
   Ranked behind New Hampshire among the 27 larger, or
manufacturing-intensive states, were Missouri, North Carolina,
Delaware and Florida.
   Heading the list of 21 states with a lighter concentration of
manufacturing was South Dakota, followed by North Dakota, Nebraska,
Nevada and Kansas.
   New Hampshire's strong showing was built on a blend of economic
and social qualities the manufacturers found attractive.
   Its state and local fiscal policies were top-ranked because New
Hampshire has no sales or state income tax, low unemployment
insurance and workers' compensation costs, and offers generous
incentive packages to manufacturers.
   But states like North Dakota and North Carolina, despite
consistently good rankings during much of the time Grant Thornton
has conducted the study, have not become manufacturing giants to
challenge traditional powers _ California (ranked 19th this year),
New York (17), Pennsylvania (21) and Michigan (26).
   ``If we look at the movement of manufacturing in this country,
we certainly see some leaving the high-cost states like Michigan
and heading somewhat for the southern, non-union states,'' said
Professor Gary Eppen of the University of Chicago's Graduate School
of Business.
   ``You don't see an explosion of manufacturing in the Dakotas,
for instance, because most of growth in the economy has not been in
manufacturing,'' he added.
   ``And even that growth which has occurred tends to be more
high-tech, in which unionization and wages don't play as big a
role. Plus, people obviously aren't giving the same weight in
making actual decisions than they are in answering
questionnaires,'' he continued.
   While welcoming the survey, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu
complained that his state would have finished even further in front
had the study's educational component been weighted to reflect
performance rather than spending.
   ``Sometimes it mystifies me what they give credit for,'' said
Sununu.
   South Dakota's No. 1 rating among less-intensive manufacturing
states followed from its ranking as lowest among the 48 states in
terms of overall labor costs.
   According to the study, South Dakota is the least unionized
state in the nation with only 3.1 percent of its workers belonging
to unions, compared with a national average of almost 20 percent.
   In other categories:
   _North Carolina ranked first in terms of state-regulated
employment costs.
   _Kansas ranked first in terms of availability and productivity
of resources.
   _North Dakota ranked first in terms of quality of life concerns.
   Alaska and Hawaii were not included in the survey because it
would be difficult to compare them with other states due to their
``substantially different economies,'' Grant Thornton stated.

<HEAD>Fed Ready to Push Interest Rates Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress Wednesday that the central bank stands ready to push
interest rates higher to stem inflation.
   And the risks of a new wage-price spiral are ``sufficiently
great'' that the Fed should err on the side of squeezing credit,
rather than stimulating the economy, he said.
   Greenspan, delivering his mid-year report on monetary policy,
noted that the Fed already has made a series of small
credit-tightening steps from late March through late June, allowing
short term interest rates to rise.
   Nevertheless, inflationary pressures _ including tight labor
markets, high factory operating rates and drought-caused increases
in grain prices _ remain and must be curbed now rather than later,
he said.
   ``As the experience of the last two decades has clearly shown,
accelerating wages and prices would have to be countered later by
quite restrictive policies, with unavoidably adverse implications
for production and employment,'' Greenspan told the Senate Banking
Committee. He referred to the double-digit inflation that led to
the 1981-82 recession.
   When Greenspan last reported to Congress in February, the
situation was quite different. Many analysts were still worried
that the shock of the October stock market crash would tumble the
country into a recession. In late January, the central bank had
pushed short-term interest rates down a notch to stimulate economic
activity.
   However, Greenspan said, ``the economy proved remarkable
resilient'' and now, ``the long-run costs of a return to higher
inflation and the risks of this occurring under current
circumstances are sufficiently great that Federal Reserve policy at
this juncture might be well advised to err more on the side of
restrictiveness rather than of stimulus.''
   He said a leveling in the unemployment rate, which hit a 14-year
low of 5.3 percent last month, and in factory operating rates,
which are at eight-year highs, is ``essential if more intense
inflationary pressures are to be avoided in the period ahead.''
   The committee briefly interrupted Greenspan's testimony to
recommend by unanimous voice vote that the full Senate confirm
Boston banker John P. LaWare's appointment to a vacant seat on the
seven-member Federal Reserve Board.
   On another subject, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve and other
central banks would continue to work for stable international
exchange rates. He said he saw no evidence the growth of U.S.
exports has been affected by the appreciation of the dollar from
three-year lows at the end of last year.
   Credit markets rallied briefly in response to the testimony,
with bond prices edging up and interest rates falling slightly.
   Greenspan's anti-inflation message, which analysts found a bit
tougher than expected, spurred Sens. James Sasser, D-Ten., and Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, to plead with the central bank chairman not to
overreact.
   ``I would come down on the side of avoiding a recession almost
at all costs,'' Sasser said. ``I do hope the Fed would not be
hypersensitive to signs, real or imagined, of inflation.''
   David Wyss, chief financial economist of Data Resources Inc., a
forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass., said, ``I think Greenspan's
attitude can best be expressed by saying, `I don't think we need a
recession, but we're not going to fight so hard against a recession
that we risk inflation.' In other words, `We'll take a little
recession in order to avoid inflation.' ''
   Despite Greenspan's relatively tough rhetoric, Wyss said the
Federal Reserve would ``keep its head low during the election
campaign'' and will avoid its strongest tightening move, an
increase in the discount rate it charges on the money it loans to
member banks.
   The central bank has nudged the federal funds rate _ the amount
banks charge each other for overnight loans _ up by about a
percentage point so far this year to 7.5 percent, but it has not
raised the discount rate since September, when it was set at 6
percent.
   Greenspan acknowledged that the spread between the two rates has
widened, but said it is the judgment of Fed policymakers to date
that ``current relationships are satisfactory.''
   In the mid-year report, Greenspan said the Fed was boosting
slightly its forecast for economic growth this year. He said it was
looking for the gross national product to expand at an annual rate
of between 2.75 percent to 3 percent. In February, the Fed had a
lower GNP growth forecast of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent.
   Greenspan also warned that it is essential that Congress make
more progress in reducing the huge federal budget deficits. He said
such a cut would be the single most important thing government
could do to reduce the country's huge foreign borrowing needs. He
urged Congress to aim ultimately for budget surpluses sometime in
the 1990s.

   For 5{ months, young people who want a
motorcycle license in Florida will be able to get one without
training, thanks to a glitch in a new law meant to toughen
instruction requirements.
   ``I guess if I were a young rider, I'd try to get my license
before January,'' said state Rep. Everett A. Kelly, who helped
draft the law.
   On Jan. 1, every motorcyclist 21 or younger will have to enroll
in at least six hours of on-cycle training and six hours of
classroom training to get a license.
   Since October, a four-hour training course had been required.
But when the new law took effect Friday, it repealed last year's
law without making any provision for the interim.
   ``We spent hours and hours drafting this legislation, and
apparently it got by our attorneys, our staff people and everyone
else,'' said Kelly. ``Sometimes these things get through.''
   Motorcyclists still must pass the written, driving and eye exams.

<HEAD>Blacks and Whites Ride Together On Commuter Trains</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks and whites on many
commuter trains rode together Wednesday for the first time, and a
Parliament member urged the government to extend integration to
buses and inter-city trains.
   The ``Whites Only'' signs on first-class train coaches started
coming down Tuesday in the Johannesburg and Durban metropolitan
areas, but many riders did not learn of the change until Wednesday.
   Commuter trains in the Cape Town area were desegregated last
month.
   ``From now on segregation will be based only on economic
principles,'' said J.C. van der Merwe, railroad manager in
Transvaal province for the state-run South African Transport
Services.
   Some blacks who rode the newly integrated first-class cars
Wednesday reported some unfriendly looks from white passengers, but
there were no reports of serious incidents.
   One white woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
black man sat beside her during her morning ride into Johannesburg
and asked if she would be back on the train the next day. When she
replied affirmatively, the man inquired: ``Are you going to learn
Xhosa?''
   Xhosa is one of the four main African languages in South Africa.
   The transport service began integrating restrooms, waiting
areas, railroad cafeterias and other amenities at train stations in
1985. Most coaches continued to be segregated according to race,
although a few first-class trains were declared open to all.
   First-class tickets cost about twice as much as third-class
tickets. There is no second-class service.
   Ebrahim Abramjee, a member of the Asian chamber of Parliament,
praised the integration of commuter trains but condemned
authorities for maintaining segregation on long-distance train
routes and on buses in several major cities.
   He said ``whites only'' benches at bus stops in Pretoria were
also an embarrassment.
   ``Nothing can change overnight. We still have partial
segregation on the inter-city trains but it is being looked at...
We have to see what is practical,'' said Leon Els, a spokesman for
Transport Minister Eli Louw, referring to continued segregation on
the 120 inter-city trains.
   Els said one of the factors that has prevented integration of
inter-city trains is the fact that they ``are overnight trains and
people sleep in the compartments. People would be sleeping in a
compartment together.''
   An exception is the luxury, long-distance Blue Train that
travels between Johannesburg and Cape Town, which is designated as
an international service and has always been desegregated.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Sun Activity Will Help Solve Space Junk Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increase in the sun's activity early in the
1990s will thin out the 7,000 pieces of manmade space junk orbiting
near Earth, a congressional subcommittee was told Wednesday.
   But there was a warning, too, that nations with space programs
had better clean up their act.
   Nicholas L. Johnson, an expert in space debris, said the
so-called solar maximum will present a unique opportunity ``to
affect noticeably the safety of future space travelers,'' because
it will substantially cleanse the environment below 400 miles
altitude.
   The solar maximum, a phenomenon that last occurred in 1980, is
expected to be above average in intensity when it peaks in 1990.
Its effect is to heat the atmosphere and cause it to expand,
causing a wider area of debris to plunge toward Earth and burn up.
   ``During the mid-1990s two great space stations _ one built by
NASA and its international partners and one constructed by the
Soviet Union _ will be deployed at altitudes near 300 miles,'' said
Johnson, an advisory scientist with Teledyne Brown Engineering in
Colorado.
   ``Actions taken by the U.S. space industry and government and by
other foreign space users can ensure that we do not unnecessarily
repopulate the region of near-Earth space below 500 miles.''
   Johnson and others testified before the House space science
subcommittee. The panel's chairman, Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said
``we have to figure out what to do about this problem before we
have a catastrophe.''
   On a table in the hearing room were samples of objects that had
been in space and were hit by man-made debris. One piece was a
section of a space shuttle window gouged by a paint flake from a
spent Delta rocket.
   Johnson said debris does not pose a serious hazard to space
operations now but might when space activities increase in the next
decade.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration already is
adding 12,000 pounds of protective shielding to the proposed space
station.
   ``Today more than 7,000 objects with a diameter of 10
centimeters (4 inches) or more are known to be in orbit about our
planet,'' said Johnson. ``At collision velocities of 8 to 10
kilometers per second, these satellites carry explosive-like
energy.''
   Donald Kessler, a debris expert at NASA's Johnson Space Center
in Houston, estimated that five times as many pieces of man-made
junk are in orbit near the Earth than can be tracked by radar.
   The experts said only 5 percent of the identified objects
spinning around Earth represent operational satellites. Fully half
come from satellites that exploded either deliberately or
accidentally.
   Since the first known satellite breakup in June 1961, Johnson
said, nearly 100 satellites have broken up in orbit, with debris
spreading out and encircling most of the globe.
   One-third of the debris is spent rocket bodies and dead
payloads, he said.
   The rest is operational debris _ objects intentionally discarded
during satellite delivery. They include such things as lens caps,
empty propellant tanks or objects thrown away or dropped outside a
spacecraft during manned activity.

   The brother of Contra leader Adolfo Calero was
among seven men who allegedly broke U.S. neutrality laws by sending
mercenaries into combat in Nicaragua, according to an indictment
unsealed Wednesday.
   One group of mercenaries tried unsuccessfully to blow up a
bridge in Sinsin, Nicaragua, in 1985, but was forced out of the
country, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Schnapp.
   The long-awaited federal indictment, which at one point was
investigated by Congress on charges that then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III tried to sidetrack the probe, did not mention any
Reagan administration officials.
   When reporters asked Interim U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen about
claims by some defendants that former National Security Council
aide Oliver North and Robert Owen, his liaison to Contra
operations, approved their operations, Lehtinen referred all
questions to the Iran-Contra independent counsel.
   The special prosecutor's office cannot comment on current
investigations, said Washington spokesman Jim Wiethart.
   Adolfo Calero's brother Mario Calero, of New Orleans, who has
been active in supplying the Contras, is accused of helping to
equip the mercenaries to battle the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
   ``I shall wear this as one more badge to show that I am proud to
be a Contra,'' Mario Calero said Wednesday when he appeared before
a U.S. magistrate in Fort Lauderdale.
   His brother, one of the Contras' five directors, did not answer
calls to his Miami home Wednesday.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said Mario Calero was in charge
of the largest rebel group's procurement in New Orleans during the
1984-85 period the indictment covers.
   ``We were very aware of the Neutrality Law,'' said Matamoros.
``I think all these questions will be clarified.'' As for the
others indicted, he said only that ``many people in the past
provided help.''
   Also appearing before the magistrate Wednesday was Thomas Posey,
head of the Alabama-based Civilian Materiel Assistance, which
allegedly hired many of the mercenaries.
   His attorney called the indictment a farce. ``It's phenomenal
that after three years this is all they could come up with.
Everybody knew what these people were doing _ Rob Owen, the
National Security Council,'' Doug Jones said.
   The others indicted were Maco Stewart, a wealthy former
assistant state attorney general and a 1960-1963 state
representative in Texas; Jack Terrell, a former mercenary who
turned against U.S. Contra policy and has cooperated with the FBI
and the Congress; Jose Coutin, a gun store owner currently at a
halfway house on unrelated charges and a former Civilian Materiel
Assistance liaison; Alex Martinez, a conservative Miami
stockbroker, and Joe Adams, a former bodyguard to Adolfo Calero.
   Stewart, who now lives in France, was ordered released on a $5
million personal bond and allowed to return to Europe. The rest
received $25,000 bonds except for Adams, who was to surrender
later. Of the six who appeared Wednesday, all pleaded innocent
except Martinez and Terrell, who lacked permanent counsel.
   The indictment accuses the seven of violating the U.S.
Neutrality Act, which prohibits mounting operations against foreign
governments from U.S. soil. Adams and Terrell are also accused of
buying a Manlicher bolt-action .308 caliber rifle to be used as a
sniper weapon in Nicaragua. They could face up to 33 years in
prison. Coutin faces 13 years because he allegedly gave his
passport to a mercenary, while the rest face a maxmimum of eight
years on the two Neutrality Act violations.
   Critics of the investigation ridiculed the indictment, saying it
caught only the small fishes.
   ``Where are the policy-makers that put together this network?''
said John Mattes, a federal public defender whose investigation of
a client's case led to accusations that the U.S. attorney's office
tried to sidetrack the probe.
   He said it was ``a joke'' that with all the illegal Contra aid
shipped to the Contras, the only weapon mentioned was a bolt-action
rifle.
   ``This is the reward you get for bucking administration
policy,'' a bitter Terrell said Wednesday. ``It doesn't pay to be a
whistleblower in the United States.''
   The two-year investigation was the subject of charges a year ago
that Meese attempted to delay the probe to keep the
administration's illegal Contra supply operations from being
exposed. Congress investigated but issued an inconclusive report.

<HEAD>Greece Issues Formal Shut-Down Notice For U.S. Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday issued a
formal shut-down notice for the four United States military bases
operating in Greece.
   The notice is a legal formality that is not expected to result
in any of the bases being closed.
   Greek and American officials currently are negotiating a new
agreement on the bases to replace the existing accord, which
expires Dec. 31. The next round of talks will take place in Athens
later this month.
   ``The foreign ministry verbally informed the United States
Embassy of the Greek government's decision to terminate the Defense
and Economic Cooperation Agreement,'' government spokesman Sotiris
Kostopoulos said in a statement.
   According to the Greek interpretation of the current five-year
accord _ signed in 1983 by the United States and the socialist
government of Premier Andreas Papandreou _ Greece is obliged to
issue a notice terminating the agreement five months before it runs
out.
   Papandreou has said he is willing to sign a new agreement, but
insists it must be approved in a referendum.
   Greek officials say negotiations that started in November 1987
have made little progress.
   The four U.S. bases in Greece _ two near Athens and two on the
southern island of Crete _ have been operating since the early
1950s.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
150,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 150,000 tons of
corn would be about 5.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.70 per bushel at the
farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around
$16 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 5.04
million tons of corn, plus more than 9 million tons of wheat;
830,700 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

   Michael Dukakis mended fences with black leaders on Wednesday
and said he and his newly minted running mate, Lloyd Bentsen,
``hope and expect'' that Jesse Jackson will support the Democratic
ticket this fall.
   An angry Jackson broke off negotiations on the platform and
other convention issues, and aides said he was ``flabbergasted''
over a perceived snub in Dukakis' handling of his vice presidential
selection. ``It is now up to Michael Dukakis to make it a unity
convention,'' said Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager.
   George Bush's search for a running mate was getting under way in
earnest. Campaign sources said the vice president likely will make
use of private polling to guage the vote-drawing appeal of various
potential ticket combinations, and a spokeswoman said Bush has no
intentions of ``parading people around'' for auditions.
   Meanwhile, the White House announced that Bush would travel to
the United Nations on Thursday to present the U.S. explanation on
destruction of an Iranian airliner. Bush said he ``can't wait'' to
argue ``the free world's case'' before the Security Council.
   With the Democratic convention just five days off, Dukakis and
Bentsen made their campaign rounds in Washington and at an
afternoon news conference Dukakis was peppered with questions about
``Jackson.''
   At first he tried to make light of the issue, saying, ``I
haven't talked to Michael Jackson in months.'' He went on to say,
``I want Jesse Jackson to be deeply involved in this campaign as a
party leader.''
   ``We want his support,'' the Massachusetts governor said. ``We
hope and expect he will be very much involved with us in the
campaign and afterwards.''
   Some black leaders urged reconciliation, including the chairman
of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``Lots of fences have been
mended,'' Rep. Mervyn Dymally of California said after a closed
door session with Dukakis and Bentsen.
   Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., a senior black House member, said he had
been disappointed that Jackson was not the choice for No. 2. ``But
it's been made, and I plan to support the ticket,'' Gray said.
   But not all of Jackson's backers were persuaded. Atlanta City
councilman Hosea Williams, a nationally known civil rights activist
but not always an ally of Jackson, announced plans for a protest
march to the convention next Monday. ``It's not that they turned
Jesse Jackson down, it's how they did it,'' he said.
   Two Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Jackson was told privately Monday afternoon that he would not be
picked. One source said Dukakis emissary Paul Brountas told Jackson
``he would bring the ticket down'' if nominated for vice president.
   Jackson didn't learn of Bentsen's selection until reporters
asked him for a comment Tuesday morning, and the perceived snub had
Jackson and his followers still seething on Wednesday.
   At his news conferencein Washington, Dukakis said he had tried
to notify Jackson by telephone of his selection of Bentsen, but
failed to reach him before word leaked out. When the two men
finally spoke, Dukakis said, ``I said I was sorry that I missed him
on the first call.''
   Bentsen said he had spoken with Jackson by phone earlier in the
day. ``Jesse Jackson is a friend of mine and he is a very able
gentleman,'' said the Texan.
   But not all of Jackson's supporters sounded ready for
reconciliation.
   ``I resented being talked to by the runt of the Democratic
political litter who did not have the courtesy to consult Jackson,
to let him know prior to the time the public knew,'' said Vera
Baugh, a delegate to the NAACP convention where Dukakis and Bentsen
spoke.
   ``To me that was a slap in my face and I am going to write in
Jesse's name. I will not vote for Dukakis,'' she said. Jackson, for
his part, had said he planned to support the ticket but would have
his name placed in nomination for president.
   Dukakis sought throughout the day to soothe any hurt feelings,
with only occasional success.
   He linked arms with members of the NAACP and sang ``We Shall
Overcome,'' and told the organization's convention in Washington
that the Democratic Party had ``opened up the door of opportunity
to a couple of guys named Dukakis and Jackson, the top two
candidates for the presidency.''
   When NAACP president Benjanim Hooks told the Democratic
nominee-in-waiting that ``knowing Jesse has been good for you,''
the Massachusetts governor replied, ``I've learned a lot from Jesse
and I've learned a lot from you.''
   Dukakis said Bentsen had been a civil rights advocate since
``way back in the 40s,'' but some in the audience booed when the
Texas senator took the microphone to speak.
   Hooks appealed for a warmer welcome, then turned the jeers to
laughter in saying, ``I empathize with you. ... I've been preaching
when they wanted somebody else to preach. One said, `We ain't going
to say Amen one time.' They didn't.''
   ``... Many of our delegates, as you know, wanted to see Jesse in
this position,'' he said. At that mention of Jackson's name, the
audience erupted in cheers and applause.
   The Democratic convention city was beginning to fill up with the
advance wave of party officials and journalists. Construction
continued inside the smallish Omni hall _ where some seats afforded
no view of the proceedings on the floor _ but party officials said
all would be ready by the time the opening gavel fell next Monday.
   Ready, perhaps, but not necessarily peaceful.
   Dukakis and Bentsen received a rousing reception from House
Democrats when they met early in the day. ``He sent one single
message,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``He wants to work with us
and reach out to us. That's what the Congress wants to hear.''
   Others were finding their disappointment harder to overcome.
   Jackson said nothing publicly during the day about Dukakis'
choice of the 67-year-old Bentsen to be his vice presidential
candidate.
   But campaign aide Brown spread the word that the runner-up in
the primary campaign was incredulous that Dukakis had not consulted
him over the choice of Bentsen, and had not informed him before the
word was made public.
   ``It seems like too big a mistake that politically astute people
would make,'' said Brown.
   He said negotiations over platform disagreements have been
suspended, at least temporarily.
   Privately, some were urging Jackson not to overreact to the
perceived snub. ``I don't think it's in Jesse's interest to get
into a fight about protocol, and have his constituents talking
about no respect, no respect,'' said one influential black
politician.
   ``What if Dukakis loses and people can point to this episode as
one of the reasons. Then Jesse has just kicked over his pail of
milk.''

<HEAD>Contract Fraud Probe at Main Army Missile Facility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal criminal investigators are looking
into allegations of contract fraud at the Army's main missile
headquarters, including alleged overcharges, favoritism and phony
bills, a congressional agency revealed Wednesday.
   In one instance, a 45-minute job was inflated to show 23 hours
of work, and on another occasion, two workers painted stripes in a
parking lot while eight others simply watched, the General
Accounting Office said.
   The Army's criminal investigative division (CID) is looking at
the allegations, which involve contracts at the Redstone Arsenal in
Huntsville, Ala., said David C. Williams of the GAO's office of
special investigations.
   Williams revealed the investigation by the CID and FBI, along
with other criminal investigations at the Redstone facility, in
testimony before the House Government Operations national security
subcommittee.
   The Redstone investigations are not related to the onging
Pentagon bribery investigation. That investigation is focused on
allegations that defense contractors and their consultants bribed
Pentagon officials for inside information that could have been
vital in bidding for contracts, most of them with the Navy, worth
billions of dollars. No charges have been filed.
   Williams said one of the GAO investigations involved a
five-year, $250 million contract between the Army Missile Command
and the Holmes and Narver Corp. of Orange, Calif., and the
Morrison-Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho. The contract was for base
support activities, including maintenance, food service and
equipment repair.
   The GAO investigation was coordinated with the Army CID,
Williams said, and it ``revealed evidence of a pattern of abuse by
the contractor and its subcontractors, including illegal
activities, currently being investigated by the Army CID.''
   Williams said:
   _In some cases time sheets were falsified to overstate hours,
including the inflated 23-hour job and the parking lot paint job.
Williams said idle workers often were told to hide from government
inspectors.
   _Building supplies were given away to workers and government
employees in an effort to cover for inflated and falsified labor
charges. Paint was thrown away and, in some cases, dumped into the
Tennessee River, Williams said.
   _A review of maintenance records for Army vehicles, focusing
only on oil changes and lube jobs, showed the Army was overcharged
by 262 percent.
   In another case, Williams said, the Gradwell Co. of Huntsville
charged the government for wages for employees who did not show up.
``These no-show employees not only did not work at Redstone
Arsenal, but (they) did not work anywhere in the state of
Alabama,'' Williams said. Gradwell also billed the government
$86,000 for non-existent repair parts, he said.
   Officials at Redstone or officials at Gradwell, Holmes and
Narver, and Morrison-Knudsen did not immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment.
   Williams also said the GAO looked at contract awards for small
businesses at Redstone and found ``criminal activity within the
system,'' which he said is being investigated by the Army CID.
   For example, he said, there appeared to be improprieties in the
awarding of time-and-material contracts.
   In 263 of the those contracts studied last year, 45 of them
showed that contractor bid proposals were ``within 1 percent of the
government's cost estimates, suggesting that there might have been
unauthorized releases of government estimates, or that contractors
themselves prepared the government's cost estimates,'' Williams
said.
   He cited three examples, including one $49,000 job in which a
contractor submitted a proposal only $3 off the government's
estimate, another $650,000 job where a bid came in that was only
$7.60 off the government estimate and a $1.3 million bid only $323
off the government's estimate.
   Williams detailed another case which said ``revealed apparent
favoritism in two contract awards'' by Army Lt. Gen. John Wall,
commander of the Army Strategic Defense Command, toward BDM
International Inc. of McLean, Va.
   In one case, the GAO said, Wall directed that BDM be made the
interim contractor for a major research initiative. In another
case, according to Williams, BDM lost out to Teledyne Brown
Engineering on a $500 million contract, but Wall ordered that
240,000 hours of support work be shifted from Teledyne to BDM.
   Since BDM charges $15 per hour more than Teledyne, Williams
said, ``this could result in an expected increase in cost of
approximately $3.6 million.''
   Wall was investigated by the Army CID, was reprimanded two
months ago and retired in June, Williams said.
   BDM officials did not immediately return telephone calls seeking
comment on Williams' statement. Attempts to locate Wall were not
immediately successful.

   Here is a transcript of Michael Dukakis'
speech Wednesday to the convention of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
   Thank you, Dr. Hooks. Ben, how would you like to start traveling
with me all over America? Thanks very, very much to all of you, and
a special thanks to Dr. Hooks, Dr. Gibson, and the good people who
met with me in Boston last week _ we had a good meeting, and I hope
it's the first of many, many meetings, not just in the campaign,
but in the transition and in the White House itself. That door's
going to be open and we're going to be working together, we're
going to be listening to each other. Yes, Ben, I've learned a lot
from Jesse, and I've learned a lot from you, and I continue to
learn and that's going to continue _ and grow stronger and stronger
as time goes on.
   May I make just a few very special introductions, if I can?
First, I'm very proud today to be with the woman who has been my
life's partner for over a quarter of a century. I want you all to
know that our dear son informed us just the other day that despite
our youth, we're going to be grandparents in January. The baby's
due to arrive between the 18th and the 31st of January, 1989. With
your help, it's going to be quite a January. Ladies and gentlemen,
the first lady of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts _ she's going
to be a great first lady of the United States of America _ Kitty
Dukakis. I'm going to save the second introduction for the end of
my speech.
   In 1954, a young man from Massachusetts who was then a senior at
Swarthmore College, a small co-educational school, as many of you
know, just outside of Philadelphia, came to this city as a student
in the Washington Semester Program at American University. Those
were difficult and troubled times. They were a time when this city
was a segregated city, and it was our capital city. It was the fall
of 1954 when a senator from Wisconsin named Joseph R. McCarthy was
being censured by the United States Senate. I'm not sure I could
have possibly believed that fall of 1954 in this capital city of
ours that I would be here today, in front of this great
organization that has given so much to this country and has so much
more to give now and in the future, speaking to you as a candidate
for the presidency of the United States.
   Dr. Hooks said something which I want to repeat. It would have
been inconceivable, as all of you and and all of us know, in 1954
or for that matter in 1984, that the two leading and final
candidates for the Democratic nomination for the presidency of the
United States would be this son of Greek immigrants from
Massachusetts and a black man who grew up poor in South Carolina.
Ladies and gentlemen, it happened, and it happened in the
Democratic Party. I'm proud of that. I'm proud of that _ I'm proud
of the fact that it was my party that has opened up the door of
opportunity to all of our citizens. And I'm proud of the fact that
I'm here today with Kitty, with senator and Mrs. Bentsen, and with
all of you.
   I'm not sure when we met a year ago in New York City that
evening, when so many of you were good enough to stick around when
I was late, and I had just arrived _ I'm not sure I could possibly
have imagined even then that I would be here today. And I'm sure I
don't have to tell any of you how seriously I take the
responsibilities of the presidency, the responsibilities of
leadership, the responsibility to be a president of all the people.
And that is what I want to talk to you about for just a few minutes
this morning.
   Twenty-nine years ago, right here in Washington, D.C., Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. concluded his remarks to a gathering of some
26,000 high school and college students with these words. He said,
``Make a career of humanity. Make a career of humanity. Commit
yourself to the noble struggle for equal rights, and you will make
a greater person of yourself, a greater nation of your country, and
a finer world in which to live. Make a career of humanity.'' That's
what Dr. Martin Luther King said that day.
   I don't know if any of you were there that day to hear him
speak, but I do know that I'm proud to be here this morning because
the NAACP has made a career of humanity _ has made a career of
humanity. From Roy Wilkins' courageous fight for anti-lynching laws
in the 1930s to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s, to
the battle we all wage today to bring down the barriers of
opportunity to citizens in this country, your leadership in
communities all over America has made this a better and a greater
nation, and I commend you for it, and I'm proud and honored to be
here today as your guest.

<HEAD>Nationalists End Congress With Younger Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Nationalist Party ended a
weeklong congress Wednesday after removing many older leaders from
the Chiang Kai-shek era and promising to expand contacts with China.
   Delegates to the 13th Nationalist congress elected President Lee
Teng-hui as party chairman, the first native Taiwanese to hold the
post.
   They also replaced three-fifths of the party's Central Committee
with new members, whose average age dropped from 70 to 59.
   The Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, has exercised one-party
rule in Taiwan since 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek and his followers
fled from mainland China after losing a civil war to the Communists.
   Premier Yu Kuo-hwa, a 74-year-old member of the Old Guard who
heads the Cabinet, was chosen 35th among 360 candidates for the
180-member Central Committee.
   Yu, viewed as the most powerful holdover from the Chiang
Kai-shek era, received fewer votes than many younger, Taiwan-born
candidates.
   For the first time in the party's 94-year history, many
delegates were not handpicked by Nationalist officials.
   But the extent of the changes in leadership will not be clear
until the new members of the Central Standing Committee, the
policy-making organ of the party, are named Thursday. A Cabinet
reshuffle also is expected soon.
   Taiwan's economic prosperity in recent years has increased the
pressure for democratization. Before he died in January, President
Chiang Ching-kuo, eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, lifted martial law
and the ban on opposition parties.
   The pace of further liberalization, however, will depend on the
personnel changes in the Cabinet and Central Standing Committee.
   ``The congress has demonstrated that our party delegates can
reflect public opinion and are full of vitality,'' said Lee
Sheng-fung, a reform-minded Nationalist legislator.
   ``But we are not certain of our new leadership yet,'' he said.
``I hope we can have a new leadership that can keep the social
trend in its grasp and make good use of this vitality.''
   Native Taiwanese representation in the newly-chosen Central
Committee increased from 17 percent to about 40 percent. About 85
percent of the island's nearly 20 million people are native
Taiwanese _ ethnic Chinese whose families lived in Taiwan before
the Nationalists arrived from the mainland.
   Lee closed the congress in suburban Taipei by reiterating his
party's traditional claim to have the sole right to govern China.
He also emphasized Taiwan's policy never to negotiate with the
communist government in Beijing.
   But the Nationalists' once-resolute policy of having no contacts
with China continued to crumble at the congress.
   Chiang Ching-kuo last October ended a ban on travel to the
mainland for family reunions, and more than 100,000 Taiwan
residents have since made the trip.
   The Nationalists also eased a ban on visits to Taiwan by
mainland China residents. Under the new policy, the Chinese can
come to the island if close relatives are ill or have died. Some
intellectuals and students also will be permitted to visit.
   In addition, the Nationalists say they want to extend Taiwan's
economic contacts with China, although all business activity must
be negotiated through third parties.

   Michael Dukakis, a week away from receiving
the Democratic presidential nomination, brushed aside Wednesday
complaints that he was tardy notifying Jesse Jackson of his vice
presidential selection and said he wanted Jackson to be ``deeply
involved in this campaign as a party leader.''
   With his designated running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,
at his side, Dukakis told a news conference on Capitol Hill that he
was unable to reach Jackson by telephone Tuesday morning to notify
him of his vice presidential decision.
   As a result, Jackson did not learn of the choice until asked
about it by reporters when he arrived at Washington's National
Airport.
   In Atlanta where Democrats were making final preparations for
the opening of the party's national convention on Monday, Jackson
convention manager Ron Brown said he was ``flabbergasted'' by the
failure to notify Jackson and said he had broken off negotiations
aimed at settling differences over platform issues.
   ``That's okay,'' said Dukakis when asked about the halt in
negotiations. ``If people want to debate certain issues, they have
a perfect right to.''
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis and Bentsen received a cool
reception from delegates to the annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``I thought it was terrific,'' said the Massachusetts governor.
``I understand many of the people in the room were actively
involved in the Jesse Jackson campaign and they were disappointed.''
   He said Jackson would have received a similar response had he
gone before a Greek-American group after defeating Dukakis in a
fight for the presidential nomination.
   ``I want Jesse Jackson to be actively involved in this campaign
as a party leader,'' said Dukakis. ``I hope and expect he will be.''
   Bentsen said he had talked to Jackson by telephone Wednesday
morning ``to establish communications.'' He gave no further details
of the conversation.
   There were scattered boos when Dukakis introduced Bentsen to the
NAACP convention. And many delegates sat silently when Dukakis
first entered the room and was introduced by NAACP executive
director Benjamin Hooks.
   A little more than 12 hours earlier, the same hotel ballroom was
packed with delegates who leapt to their feet repeatedly to cheer
and applaud Jackson.
   The Massachusetts governor flew to the capital with Bentsen for
a day of joint appearances before members of Congress as well as
the speech to the NAACP.
   The pair met for abou 45 minutes with members of the
Congressional Black Caucus. ``It went well,'' Bentsen said as he
emerged, and the comments of black House members generally
reflected that assessment.
   ``Lots of fences have been mended,'' said caucus chairman Rep.
Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif. ``We had a very fruitful discussion about
the convention, the campaign and the presidency.''
   ``It's a strong ticket. It's a winning ticket,'' said Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., adding: ``It was very friendly in the room.''
   Dymally said Dukakis offered an explanation for why Jackson was
not notified of his selection of Bentsen as vice presidential
running mate before it was made public on Tuesday, saying he sought
to call Jackson first but was unable to reach him because Jackson
had left his hotel.
   But for some members, it wasn't enough.
   ``I was disappointed,'' said Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., who said
he had hoped for some specific commitment to at least symbolically
show that Jackson would be a special third member of the ticket.
   The way Jackson learned of the No. 2 choice was ``a
demonstration of disrespect,'' Owens said, and Dukakis' account
``was a lame explanation.''
   After the designated Democratic ticket met with House Democrats,
Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said the session evoked ``real
enthusiasm.''
   ``I think Dukakis and Bentsen together can deliver Texas,'' said
Wright.
   The session was closed as were later meetings with Senate
Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus.
   Dukakis was returning to Boston Wednesday night where he still
was looking for about $100 million in spending cuts to bring his
state budget into balance.
   Current plans called for the Massachusetts governor to fly to
Houston, Texas, on Sunday for a rally with Bentsen after which the
two would fly together to Atlanta where the Democratic National
Convention will nominate them for president and vice president.
   The roll call for the presidential nomination, with Dukakis and
Jackson as the only names before the convention, will take place
Wednesday night. The following night the convention will be asked
to ratify Dukakis' choice of Bentsen as the vice presidential
nominee.
   Many delegates at the NAACP convention said they were angry over
the fact Dukakis did not notify Jackson of his decision on the vice
presidency before it was made public.
   Beulah C. Wright of Main Line, Pa., said Dukakis had been ``very
rude'' to Jackson. Asked if she would vote for the Dukakis-Bentsen
ticket, she replied, ``I'm going to have to think about that. When
you put him against Bush, I probably will.''
   ``To me that was a slap in the face,'' said Vera Baugh of
Pasadena, Calif. ``I am going to write in Jesse's name. I will not
vote for Dukakis.''
   In Atlanta, Jackson convention manager Ron Brown said, ``We were
flabbergasted by the way this was handled.'' He said, ``It is now
up to Michael Dukakis to make this a unity convention.''
   After Dukakis entered the room to subdued applause, the first
burst of enthusiasm came when Hooks turned to the governor and
said, ``You know, knowing Jesse has been good for you.''
   ``I've learned a lot from Jesse,'' said Dukakis. ``And I've
learned a lot from you.''

   Four weeks ago, I, too, had the privilege of addressing an
audience of mostly young people, although it was a much smaller one
than Dr. King spoke to in 1959. It included the members of the
first graduating class at the new campus of the Roxbury Community
College in the City of Boston. A sumbol to all of us in my state of
educational opportunity, of economic opportunity of the future for
young people in our city and in our state. And there, I felt not
only the sense of pride and accomplishment of those young
graduates, I felt the pride of an entire community, and I was very
proud to have been a part of building that campus and making that
opportunity available to those young people and to their community.
I felt the pride of mothers and fathers who had worked so hard for
years so that children would have a chance to wear a cap and gown.
I saw the pride of youngsters who would now have to look no further
than to their older brothers and sisters for the inspiration to
work hard and to stay in school. I could feel the pride of teachers
who had helped to unlock the door of opportunity for a generation
of their community's young. I could sense all around me pride of
the people of Roxbury about that beautiful new college campus it
could call its own. And I thought to myself that morning, this is
what it's all about. This is what public service is all about. This
is what leadership is all about. This is what all of us are all
about. Expanding the circle of opportunity, deepening the sense of
community, building pride, making a real difference in the lives of
real people. This is how you create a new world, and this is how
we're going to make the American dream come true for every single
citizen in this country, no matter who they are or where they come
from or what the color of their skin. And this, my friends, is what
the election of 1988 is all about.
   Over the past 16 months, I've campaigned from one end of this
country to another, campaigned with many of you. I've met you, I've
sat down with you. We've talked together. And I know, and you know
that some neighborhoods and some communities in this country of
ours are doing very, very well. But opportunity for some isn't the
goal we set for America. And maintaining the status quo, running in
place, standing still, isn't the kind of future we want for our
country. We want to grow, we want to keep growing, and we want to
grow together. We want to grow together as one nation, one
community, one family.
   This fall, the American people will be asked to choose between
two very different styles of leadership, between two very different
records of public achievement, between two very different ideas of
how to build the best America. My friends, some people say we need
Star Wars. I say we need star schools. That's what we need for the
youngsters of this country. Some people want to overthrow
governments in Central America. I want to create jobs in middle
America. That's what this election is all about.
   Some candidates are worried about where we went to college. I
care about whether our children will have the chance to go to
college and can afford the tuition. Some people say we can't create
opportunity for all Americans and build a strong national economy
at the same time. I say nonsense to that. Opportunity for all and a
healthy and growing economy go hand in hand.
   I've been my state's chief executive for 10 years. I've been in
public service for a quarter of a century, and let me say I'm proud
of it. I'm proud of the fact that my vocation is public service,
and I hope I can encourage thousands and thousands of young people
in this country to go into public service as president of the
United States.

   Farmers in counties not hit by drought may
harvest hay under various government acreage and conservation
programs if they donate it to those in drought-stricken areas,
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng announced Wednesday.
   Previously, hay could be taken only from idled program land in
counties approved for emergency haying or grazing due to drought.
There are nearly 2,000 of those designated counties in 37 states.
   A producer who wishes to donate hay should contact the local
office of the department's Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service for harvesting permission, Lyng said.
   The farmer than must donate the hay through a designated state
agency engaged in drought relief efforts.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., said Wednesday he
owes his life to a Democratic colleague _ working for his
re-election defeat _ who saved him from choking on an apple slice
that rendered him blue and unconscious.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., who stepped out of a Capitol
elevator and found Hecht in istress Tuesday, dislodged the food
after applying the Heimlich maneuver four times, witnesses said.
   ``I had the good fortune that John was there,'' Hecht said. ``My
wife and children are forever grateful, as am I. ... He saved my
life.'' The senator said his wife called Kerry on Wednesday to
thank him personally and his children and sister are writing Kerry.
   ``It was clear to me I couldn't breathe,'' said the 59-year-old
lawmaker. ``It's a sensation that I never had before. ... It's a
horrible sensation.''
   Hecht said he was seated at the Republican senators' weekly
luncheon Tuesday and had the first bite of a fruit salad when a
small apple slice caught in his throat.
   Hecht said he went out to the hall, gasping for air. He said
Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., slapped Hecht on the back, but
without effect.
   At that point, Kerry stepped out of an elevator with his press
secretary, Larry Carpman, saw Hecht was in trouble and applied the
Heimlich maneuver.
   ``He's a strong guy, and I'm not too tall, about 5-5. He picked
me right up and knew just what to do,'' said Hecht.
   Carpman and Hecht said it took four thrusts to dislodge the
apple enough to allow the senator to breathe again. But Hecht said
the food was not removed for another 30 to 45 minutes by Capitol
physicians.
   ``The realization is hitting me today how serious it was. I just
came back down from seeing the doctor. My throat is very, very
sore,'' Hecht said. He said he probably won't eat solid food for a
few days.
   Ironically, Kerry, as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, has targeted Hecht in his re-election bid.
   ``You know, that says something about America,'' said Hecht.
``That's the difference between America and another country. He's
targeted me as No. 1 (to defeat), yet he saved my life. That's the
story of America.''
   Hecht is regularly rated as one of the most conservative members
of the Senate, while Kerry is one of the most liberal.
   Kerry had never used the life-saving maneuver before, Carpman
said. He did not know where Kerry learned the procedure, adding,
``He just seemed to act very instinctively.''
   Kerry played down the incident and instructed his aides not to
publicize it.
   ``I think Dr. Heimlich deserves the credit,'' he said while
appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show to discuss presidential
politics.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Down to Business in Choosing a Running Mate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For George Bush, the search for a Republican
running mate began in earnest on Wednesday as he planned to meet
with key advisers to discuss the selection process. A spokeswoman
said Bush has no intention of ``parading people around.''
   Bush campaign sources said the vice president likely will use
private polling to gauge the vote-drawing appeal of various ticket
combinations as he moves toward a decision.
   Meanwhile, Bush decided to keep a low profile during most of the
Democratic convention next week. He extended a planned three-day
fishing trip with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III to five
days.
   He will spend Saturday through Wednesday at a remote location
near Cody, Wyo., aides said. Campaign sources said Bush would use
the time to discuss broad campaign strategy, as well as potential
running mates, with Baker.
   Baker, a long-time friend who managed Bush's failed 1980
presidential campaign and oversaw President Reagan's 1984
re-election campaign, is expected to resign his Treasury post later
this summer to become Bush's campaign chairman.
   Bush plans to actively campaign from late Wednesday through the
following weekend, aides said.
   Meanwhile, Bush goes to New York on Thursday to argue the U.S.
case before the United Nations Security Council, which is
considering a resolution condemning the United States for the
shooting down of an Iranian jetliner.
   ``Efforts to second guess the the captain of that ship will be
rebuffed,'' Bush said in a speech to the American Farm Bureau
Federation. ``I can't wait to get up there to defend the policy of
the United States government.''
   The completion of the Democratic ticket on Tuesday with Michael
Dukakis' selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as his running
mate started up Bush's own search for a running mate, campaign
aides said.
   ``He'll decide on his process and then very privately carry it
out. He's not parading people around at all. What you'll hear is a
lot of conjecture, but none of it will be from him,'' said Bush's
press secretary Shelia Tate.
   Ms. Tate said Bush expected to work on the selection process in
meetings in Washington before he leaves for his fishing trip.
   Bush still intends to disclose his choice at the Republican
National Convention in New Orleans in mid-August, she said. ``He
smiles and laughs and says he wants to see if he can hold it until
then,'' she said.
   The six key Bush advisers who are overseeing his campaign _
campaign chairman Lee Atwater, chief of staff Craig Fuller,
strategist Robert Teeter, media consultant Roger Ailes, New York
investment banker Nicholas Brady and Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher
_ met on Tuesday to discuss the Bentsen nomination, said campaign
sources.
   Campaign sources said Teeter would recommend targeted polling to
determine which potential GOP vice presidential choice might have
the best vote-drawing ability.
   Bush in the past has said geographical concerns are important in
balancing the ticket, but not the prime concern.
   Furthermore, the vice president has said he wants to make sure
he uses ``a different method'' than President Reagan did in naming
him to the No. 2 spot on the ticket in 1980. He was an 11th hour
compromise at the 1980 convention after a chaotic few days during
which Reagan toyed with the idea of sharing the ticket with former
President Gerald Ford.
   Political analysts continued to speculate on what the Bentsen
choice might mean for the makeup of the GOP ticket.
   ``There are two tracks going on,'' said Norman Ornstein, an
analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ``He
can now counter Bentsen with (Kansas Sen.) Bob Dole, pick the
Washington insider, the veteran who knows how to make things work
in the Senate. That would be the safe choice.''
   ``The other theory is that he will go for a young face _ someone
like (South Carolina Gov.) Carroll Campbell, (former Tennessee
Gov.) Lamar Alexander or (New Jersey Gov.) Thomas Kean.''
   Ornstein said he did not think Bush would pick a woman running
mate because ``that would be a gamble and George Bush is not a
gambler.''
   Eddie Mahe, a GOP consultant and a campaign adviser to Bush,
said he thinks Bush ``should reinforce the conservative side. It is
the activist-oriented conservative side where some reinforcement is
needed.''
   Mahe suggested Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor or Sen.
William Armstrong of Colorado but added, ``He'll probably end up''
with New York Rep.
   Jack Kemp because Kemp might help in his native California.

   And I know that if we're going to take on and beat our foreign
competition, if we're going to make the label ``Made in America''
once again the hallmark of quality and value and durability, if
we're going to be the No. 1 and stay No. 1, we're going to need all
of our people.
   That means that the children who enter school in this fall in
Philadelphia, in Birmingham and Detroit, and in towns and cities
all over America, must be the best prepared, the best skilled, and
the best educated in the world. It means that we've got to give
those citizens of ours who happen to be on public assistance real
training for real jobs and quality day care for their children, if
we're going to help them to lift themselves out of poverty and to
become independent and self-sufficient, and Senator Bentsen is one
of the leaders in the Congress that is right now attempting to do
that.
   It means we've got to do for the nation what I'm proud to say we
have already done in my state. Last April, I became the first
governor in the history of this country to sign legislation that
will guarantee basic health insurance to every single citizen in my
state. And if one state can do it, ladies and gentlement, we should
be able to do it for the entire United States of America. We have
40 million Americans, most of them members of working families who
don't have a dime of health insurance, 40 years after Harry Truman,
in this city, said that basic health insurance and basic heath
security should be the birthright of every American. And we're
going to work hard, beginning in January of 1989, with you and with
the Congress of the United States, to make good on that commitment
that President Truman made some 40 years ago.

<HEAD>House Panel Accuses Illinois Cooler Manufacturer of Stonewalling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a House panel examining health
hazards caused by lead in drinking-water coolers accused an
Illinois manufacturer on Wednesday of stonewalling their
investigation.
   Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., said
Halsey Taylor of Freeport, Ill., should quit denying in the face of
contradictory evidence that it made coolers containing lead and
recall any of its products which might be contaminated.
   The demands came at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on health and the environment, which Waxman chairs, on
Sikorski's bill to eradicate lead from school drinking-water
supplies.
   Lead is a poison that damages the brain, kidneys and other
organs. It is particularly hazardous to growing children.
   ``We have never intentionally manufactured any cooler with a
lead lining or lead materials inside the tank,'' Robin G. Munden,
the company's lawyer, told the subcommittee. ``We have carefully
examined manufacturing records going back to 1920, and there is not
a single mention of lead materials or lead lining on any of those
tanks.''
   However, Waxman said that in tests last year of 20 coolers used
by the Navy, the Environmental Protection Agency found eight of 12
Halsey Taylor units had tanks lined with lead-based solder.
   He said water from one Halsey Taylor cooler tested was
contaminated with lead at concentrations of 2,000 parts per
billion, 40 times the current federal drinking-water standard and
100 times the standard EPA is expected to adopt later this year.
   ``We haven't yet been able to confirm that the EPA tests were
accurate,'' Munden said. ``Assuming they were, we don't know what
the source of the lead in those tanks was. When we've had an
opportunity to confirm that, then we'll have an explanation.''
   He said Halsey Taylor, a subsidiary of Household International
Inc. and one of the nation's largest manufacturers of water
coolers, will act responsibly if independent tests showed the
company was at fault.
   ``How do you take responsibility if you deny responsibility in
the face of evidence?'' Waxman said during an exchange with Munden.
``How are you taking responsibility, simply by stonewalling a
committee of Congress, when the facts have been established by the
Environmental Protection Agency?''
   ``We have not deliberately or indirectly misled this
committee,'' the lawyer replied. ``We believe Halsey Taylor tanks
are safe.''
   Holding up half a tank from a Halsey Taylor cooler, Sikorski
said it had a uniform lead lining which could not have come from
what the company suggested might be a pinhole leak caused by
manufacturing error and demanded they ``come clean.''
   ``Letting your kid drink from one of these is like handing her a
glass of lead Kool-aid,'' he said. ``Until they clean up their act,
I won't drink a drop of water from a Halsey Taylor cooler.''
   Sikorski said his bill would require the immediate
identification and recall of all lead-contaminated coolers and
would hold the manufacturer responsible for all costs.

<HEAD>Cabinet Approves Bills to Tax Wealthy and Help Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist Premier Michel Rocard's government
approved two bills Wednesday that would tax the rich to guarantee
the poor a minimum income.
   The ``Solidarity Wealth Tax'' would take between 0.5 percent and
0.9 percent annually from someone's net worth if it exceeds four
million francs (about $645,000). The tax would finance a guaranteed
minimum income for citizens and foreign residents without means.
   ``This tax is explained by the need for the most favored people
... to perhaps participate more than others in this effort of
solidarity,'' said government spokesman Claude Evin, who also is
minister of solidarity, health and social protection.
   The bills approved by the Cabinet will go to the National
Assembly during its autumn session. They were among the top
priorities set by President Francois Mitterrand in his successful
campaign for election earlier this year.
   A controversial wealth tax imposed by a Socialist government in
1982 prompted some French citizens to move large portions of their
money out of the country. That tax, assessed on worth of three
million francs or more, was abolished in 1986 when the conservative
government of Premier Jacques Chirac came to power for two years.
   About 110,000 households would be affected by the new tax, the
same number as previously, but the tax rates are lower than in the
previous case. Exemptions are nearly identical, including
family-owned businesses, art works and forest land.
   The tax is expected to produce about $645 million a year to help
about 500,000 people, who would have to agree to take part in
job-searech programs. Individuals would get the equivalent of at
least $323 a month to live on, and couples would get $484.

<TEXT>
   A Lebanese man on trial for the
1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner to Beirut testified Wednesday that
he fought with a Moslem militia in Lebanon and smuggled explosives
into West Germany.
   In his first statement to a Frankfurt court, Mohammed Ali Hamadi
said he fought for two years with the Shiite Amal militia in Beirut.
   But he denied belonging to the radical pro-Iranian Moslem group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be the umbrella
group for kidnappers holding Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite, is charged with murder and air piracy
in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner on an Athens-to-Rome
flight.
   U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem of Waldorf, Md., was shot and
killed after the hijackers forced the plane to land in Beirut.
Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage during the 17-day ordeal.
   One of Hamadi's brothers, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is chief of
security for Hezbollah in Beirut. Another brother, Abbas Ali
Hamadi, was convicted in April of kidnapping two West Germans in
Lebanon in an attempt to win freedom for Mohammed Hamadi. He was
sentenced to 13 years in prison by a Duesseldort court.
   During Wednesday's session, Mohammed Hamadi refused to answer
questions relating to the hijacking or to his brother Abdul-Hadi.
   ``I am not a member of the Hezbollah,'' Hamadi said in Arabic.
His comments were translated into German by a court-appointed
interpreter.
   Hamadi told the court he had smuggled liquid explosives into
West Germany twice, contradicting a statement he made to police
after his January 1987 arrest at Frankfurt airport. At the time,
Hamadi told police he thought the bottles were filled with alcohol
and denied knowing they contained explosives.
   He insisted he was not told why the explosives were being
smuggled into West Germany. ``A certain person asked me to smuggle
them in and hide them,'' Hamadi said. ``I did it twice. The second
time I was arrested.''
   ``I don't know the reason why the explosives were brought in,''
he said. ``I was not told.''
   Hamadi said his statements to police after his arrest were made
under duress. He alleged that West German interrogators threatened
him with extradition to the United States if he did not cooperate.
   West Germany's refusal to extradite Hamadi later led to
temporarily strained relations between Bonn and Washington.
   Hamadi also contended he was one or two years younger than
official documents indicate.
   The court is trying to determine Hamadi's age at the time the
hijacking was being planned to determine whether he will be tried
as a juvenile, a young adult or an adult. Depending on the
classification, he could receive from 15 years to life in prison if
convicted.
   ``The passport which I had when I came to West Germany in 1982
listed the year of my birth as 1964,'' Hamadi told the court. ``But
that date is false. I am one or two years younger, but I can't give
an exact date.''
   He said he believed his father had altered his birth date to get
additional child support from the Lebanese goverment.
   Hamadi said he was an Amal militiaman between 1980 and 1982, but
left after becoming disillusioned with the group's leadership.
   Hamadi's testimony about his past with Amal would make him a
teen-age street fighter in war-torn Beirut. According to Hamadi, he
would have been 14 or 15 when he joined Amal. Official court
documents have him as 16.
   ``I was forced (by cirumstances) to carry weapons,'' Hamadi
said. ``I wanted to fight against Israel.'' He said he did not know
if he killed anyone.
   Hamadi is being tried under heavy security in a specially
constructed prison courtroom. Officials have scheduled court days
into December and say more could be added.
   One of the hostages Hamadi's brother was convicted of
kidnapping, engineer Alfred Schmidt, was released in September
1987. The second, Rudolf Cordes, a businessman, is still being held
in Beirut.
   The longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   A horse is a horse, of course, of
course. Unless it's a mule. And that's what Jezebel is even though
he's winning top honors in the Nebraska State 4-H Horse Show.
   The 3-year-old mule earned a red ribbon Wednesday in the pony
pleasure competition on Wednesday. A mule is the offspring of a
donkey and a horse.
   Jezebel, owned by Gene Daniel of Stanton, won blue ribbons in
pony pleasure and western horsemanship at district competition to
qualify for the state show.
   R.B. Warren, extension 4-H horse specialist at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln, said Jezebel is the first mule to show at
district shows or to qualify for the state show in its 25-year
history.
   Mules have a reputation for stubborness, but Daniel said Jezebel
isn't necessarily stubborn.
   ``Once you get something through to her, she remembers it a lot
longer (than a horse),'' Daniel said. ``But it takes twice as long.
Once it's done, they'll never forget.''
   Daniel, 19, said he gets some curious looks when he rides the
mule, and horses look at Jezebel funny when she starts to bray.
   Daniel said he grew up with horses but said mules have won him
over.
   ``I won't buy another horse for quite awhile,'' he said.

   'Tis the season to be hot and sweaty _
except at interstate rest stops where 'tis the season to celebrate
Christmas in July.
   ``It's been so hot,'' vacation guide Dawn Wisdom said Tuesday.
``We are just reminding them it will be cold again before they know
it.''
   The sign in her information booth at the Interstate 80 stop near
Kearney in central Nebraska says there are only 166 shopping days
until Christmas.
   There is a tiny Christmas tree with blinking lights, silver
garland and two bright red reindeer. Christmas stockings have been
hung by the railing with care and Wisdom is passing out peppermint
candy.
   ``It's the only Christmas-type candy I could find,'' said Ms.
Wisdom, who was decked out in a red blouse and hat for a lunch-hour
Christmas carol fest.
   Christmas in July is being celebrated at all 24 rest stops along
Nebraska's insterstate system, Wisdom said. But guides at each stop
can determine how they want to celebrate.

   Tennis buffs in this exclusive community
might find it hard to practice at night without a partner. That's
because the town has restricted the use of noisy tennis ball
serving machines.
   Town Council gave final approval Tuesday to an ordinance
limiting the use of the electric servers. Town officials had
considered an outright ban.
   ``The council received several complaints from people who found
the noise obnoxious and a nuisance,'' town attorney John Randolph
said Wednesday.
   ``We don't anticipate that this is a great problem in the town
or that it will have to be used very often.''
   Palm Beach was lampooned by Garry Trudeau in ``Doonesbury'' for
a law requiring workers to carry ID cards. That law was declared
unconstitutional. The ordinance prohibiting men from topless
jogging also was struck down.
   The tennis ball machine ordinance limits their use to the same
weekday, daytime hours set aside for heavy construction.
   The regulation will be enforced only if there are complaints,
officials said. The maximum fine is $250.

   Egypt has notified the United States it will
not return two military officers wanted for questioning in a
technology smuggling investigation.
   But the State Department said Wednesday it would await the
results of a promised Egyptian investigation before making any
judgment.
   Egypt promised to ``share the results'' with U.S. authorities,
Phyllis Oakley, the department spokeswoman, said.
   Federal officials last month alleged a conspiracy to export the
chemical carbon-carbon, which is used to make missile nose cones
and stealth aircraft less visible to radar.
   Lt. Col. Mohammed Abdella Mohammed, who was assigned to the
Egyptian Embassy in Washington, was arrested in Baltimore and then
released after claiming diplomatic immunity.
   He then went home to Cairo. Another Egyptian military
procurement official, Adm. Abdel Rahim Elgohary, also was called
home in the wake of the charges.
   Although Elgohary was not charged in the case, the Customs
Service mentioned him in an affidavit as having played a role.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann, who
is being expelled by the Reagan administration, has served here 3{
years, but he was not the Sandinista government's first choice for
the post.
   Initially, Nicaragua had intended to appoint Deputy Foreign
Minister Nora Astorga as ambassador, but the Reagan administration
refused to accept her because of her role in the 1978 slaying of a
high-ranking officer in the National Guard of deposed President
Anastasio Somoza.
   The Sandinistas then decided send Tunnermann, who was education
minister at the time, to the embassy in Washington. Two previous
Sandinista ambassadors to Washington had defected but Tunnermann,
54, has worked tirelessly in support of his leftist government.
Initially, he was plagued by his limited knowledge of English, but
he has largely overcome that problem.
   He also is Nicaragua's ambassador to the Organization of
American States here.
   Before becoming education minister, Tunnermann was rector of the
University of Nicaragua for two years and an official in Colombia
with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.
   He is married and the father of eight children. The family has
lived in a fashionable area of suburban Maryland.
   Short in stature with an amiable manner, Tunnermann pressed hard
for an improvement in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations. But the Reagan
administration insisted that a clear demonstration of Sandinista
interest in democracy must come first. As a result, Tunnermann
seldom has had an opportunity to deal on matters of substance with
administration officials.
   Last December, at a State Department Christmas party, Adolfo
Calero, a leader of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, extended his hand
in friendship to Tunnermann but the envoy rejected the gesture.
   He urged Calero to take up the Nicaraguan government's offer of
amnesty to the rebels, then walked away.
   Tunnermann has been ordered to leave the United States by Friday
as a result of State Department claims that he engaged in
``abuses'' during his stay here.
   The administration has refused to provide details. Tunnermann
has denied any wrongdoing.
   The decision to oust Tunnermann and seven colleagues came after
the Sandinistas expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven
of his aides from Nicaragua.

<HEAD>On the Road with Jackson: Where Does It End?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, his 1988 presidential campaign
winding down, takes to the road Thursday en route to the Democratic
National Convention _ while angry supporters search for a signal of
how he will end his remarkable effort.
   The possibilities range from unity to confrontation.
   Jackson's words and actions as he finally acknowledges Michael
Dukakis' victory _ and Lloyd Bentsen spot on the ticket _ will not
only shape the tone of the Democratic National Convention here
starting Monday. They will also mold the enthusiasm that his
supporters give to the Democratic ticket in the fall.
   Will Jackson push floor fights on the platform on Tuesday night
at the convention? Will he push on to the presidential nomination
roll-call on Wednesday? Or will he condone supporters' suggestions
that his name be on the vice presidential roll-call as well?
   ``I'm not suggesting that I will compete for a place on the
ticket but the floor is wide open on Thursday night when the (vice
presidential) recommendation is made,'' Jackson said in Chicago on
Wednesday.
   That's as much of a sign as Jackson has delivered in the 24
hours after Jackson was embarrassed by Dukakis' failure to reach
him before word circulated of the selection of Lloyd Bentsen as the
vice presidential nominee.
   Jackson learned of the Bentsen selection from a reporter Tuesday
morning. Publicly, his aides have said they were flabbergasted by
the ``major miscalculation,'' and on Wednesday they spread the word
to suspend all convention negotiations between the Dukakis and
Jackson campaigns.
   ``You can assume we have the wherewithal to make our presence
felt on everything that happens at the convention,'' said Jackson
convention manager Ron Brown.
   It is clear that it is not clear what Jackson will do.
   It is clear his supporters are upset.
   ``They still expect him to be a good old boy and get out the
vote. Well, respect that good old boy,'' said Melinease Hutchinson
of Norfolk, Va. ``Dukakis should have given Jesse the respect of
making certain he personally informed him.''
   ``It's not that they turned Jesse Jackson down, it's how they
did it,'' said Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams said,
accusing Dukakis of an ``un-American racial injustice ...
perpetrated upon millions of American voters'' who voted for
Jackson for president.
   Williams plans a march Monday outside the convention hall to
protest.
   Jackson himself has put up only veiled cues as to his plans.
   In an emotional speech to the annual meeting of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Washington on
Tuesday, Jackson reached a peak of intensity by declaring over and
over again his effort will culminate in the presidential roll call.
   ``When my name goes in nomination, our struggle is being
vindicated,'' he said. ``We go to Atlanta not to smile and style
and profile, but to deliberate and debate our nation's priorities.''
   But one Jackson aide warned against reading too much into any
general Jackson rhetoric.
   This aide said that Jackson himself is still deciding on
tactics, decisions he will work through on the three-day bus trip
starting Thursday in Chicago and ending Saturday in Atlanta.
   As Jackson pondered, Dukakis and Bentsen moved Wednesday to try
to minimize the squabble.
   Dukakis, the Democratic nominee-in-waiting, denied Wednesday
that any insult had been intended by the communications foul-up.
And he said he apologized when he did talk to Jackson.
   ``I told him how sorry I was I hadn't been able to get through
to him,'' Dukakis told a Capitol Hill news conference.
   One Jackson aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
there is an emotional reaction within the campaign that the slight
was intentional. But this aide said Jackson believes Dukakis
decided to lump him in with all the other also-rans for the vice
presidency, setting up the current furor.
   It is also true that some of the public anger is public
posturing on the part of shrewd politicians looking for advantage
in the endgame of the Democratic nomination process.
   ``He's probably allowing some of his people to beat up (on the
phone call issue) because he's still negotiating on some other
issues,'' said one Jackson adviser would not be quoted by name.
   The current furor _ however interesting for the political
insiders _ has to be put in the perspective of Jackson's entire
1988 campaign.
   He has run a professional, disciplined effort, aimed at building
his own coalition and the party at the same time. The divisive
rhetoric of his 1984 effort has not been heard in 1988.
   It is unlikely that Jackson would tear down the respect he has
earned from many inside the party with a final angry gesture that
could hurt the Democratic chances in the fall.
   ``We go down to a convention where Democrats get together to put
their ticket together. That's going to be a positive act and Jesse
Jackson's going to be a positive leader,'' said Jackson adviser Ann
Lewis on Wednesday. ``Again, you're going to see a Jesse Jackson
who is forward-looking, who's talking about the fall, who's talking
about the issues. That's what's important and that's what's at
stake.''

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Die Of Wounds, One Injured In Clashes</HEAD>

   Two Palestinian teen-agers died Wednesday of
bullet wounds suffered in earlier clashes with Israeli troops, and
a Palestinian was wounded by army gunfire in new battles in the
West Bank, hospital officials said.
   In south Lebanon, meanwhile, Israeli paratroopers on a
search-and-destroy mission clashed with Arab guerrillas, and the
army said three guerrillas and one Israeli were killed in the
firefight.
   In newly released figures, the chief military prosecutor said
2,800 Palestinians are being detained for up to six months without
charges, up about 300 from last month, Israel army radio reported.
In addition, about 3,000 Palestinians are being held on charges of
anti-Israeli violence.
   Also Wednesday, the army blew up two homes of Arabs suspected of
throwing firebombs and stones at Israeli targets, and it sealed
four other houses.
   In another development, the army said it has opened an
investigation into reports that soldiers brutally beat Arabs in the
Gaza Strip twice this month.
   In one incident, troops were suspected of throwing the victims
into cactus bushes after beating them, the daily Haaretz reported.
   In the second case, troops allegedly beat four Palestinians,
then took them to military headquarters, where they forced them to
lie on the ground and trampled on their fingers, the newspaper said.
   Troops opened fire Wednesday on Palestinians in the West Bank
city of Nablus to disperse protests started by news that two Arab
youths wounded Monday had died of their injuries, an Arab reporter
said.
   A Palestinian was seriously wounded by a bullet to the stomach
in the clash, said officials at Nablus' Ittihad Hospital.
   Samir Sayah, 16, who also was shot in the stomach in a clash
with troops Monday, died of his wounds Wednesday, the officials
said.
   Amjad Deed Nafea, 18, who was shot in the chest in Monday's
fighting in Nablus, died Wednesday at Jerusalem's Mukassad
Hospital, officials there said.
   The fatalities brought to 222 the number of Palestinians killed
in the 7-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Four Israelis have died since the violence began.
   In the West Bank villages of Ras Karkar and Janiyeh near
Ramallah, the army blew up two homes belonging to three Arabs
suspected of throwing a firebomb at an army patrol June 9. Two
officers were badly burned in the attack. The Ras Karkar home of a
fourth suspect in the attack was sealed, the army said.
   Troops also sealed three homes in the northern West Bank village
of Atil. The homes belonged to Palestinians suspected of stoning
and torching buses in April, the army said.
   In southern Lebanon, about 60 Israeli soldiers and allied
Lebanese Christian militiamen intercepted a group of pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslems belonging to Hezbollah, or Party of God, who were
planning a cross-border raid against Israel, police said.
   The brief battle occurred near the village of Qillaya, 10 miles
north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, the army and television
reports said.
   The trooper who died was the eighth Israeli soldier killed in
clashes near the Israeli-Lebanese border this year. About 30
Israeli soldiers have been wounded. According to Israeli reports,
more than 110 guerrillas and nine South Lebanon Army militiamen
have been killed this year.
   Israel established a six-to-10 mile security zone north of the
border after it withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon in 1985
following a three-year occupation. The strip has been the target of
frequent attacks by Palestinian and Shiite Moslem guerrillas.

Independence</HEAD>

   Angola, Cuba and South Africa agreed that
Cuban troops will withdraw from Angola and South Africa will end
its 73-year rule over Namibia, officials announced today.
   The parties did not agree on a timetable for the Cuban
withdrawal at this week's private meetings, Assistant Secretary of
State Chester A. Crocker said during a news conference at the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations.
   Earlier today, Angola's defense minister accused South Africa of
duplicity by participating in the peace talks even as it staged
attacks in southern Angola, according to a report by the official
Angolan news agency ANGOP.
   Officials from Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States
met in private today at a hotel near the United Nations.
   Private talks were held Monday and Tuesday under tight security
at the U.S. Coast Guard base on Governors Island in New York harbor.
   Cuba has an estimated 50,000 troops fighting alongside Angolan
government forces against U.S.-backed anti-communist rebels. South
Africa has demanded that the Cuban troops leave Angola before it
accepts a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for independence
for South-West Africa, or Namibia.
   The four parties first met in London in early May and then
reconvened late last month in Cairo, Egypt. South African and
Angolan officials held a separate meeting in May in Brazzaville,
Congo.
   The timetable for the withdrawal of the Cubans is probably the
most difficult unresolved issue, U.S. officials have said.
   The U.S. goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, the
same time span that the U.N. resolution sets for granting
independence to Namibia.
   Angola and Cuba have insisted that the Cuban withdrawal should
take place over four years, but the U.S. officials believe that is
an opening bargaining position that is subject to change as peace
talks proceed.
   Angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from
Namibia into Angola to support the rebel forces known as UNITA, or
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, in their
clashes with Cuban and Angolan forces.

<HEAD>White House Seeks Consultations on Marcos Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House has asked to be consulted
before any attempt by the Justice Department to obtain an
indictment of former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Marlin Fitzwater said he could not confirm a published report
that U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani recommended a grand jury
indictment of Marcos and his wife Imelda in connection with their
New York real estate holdings.
   Fitzwater did say, however, ``we have told the Justice
Department that before indictments are issued, the White House does
want to review the matter.''
   Fitzwater said there was nothing irregular or unusual about the
practice of giving the White House some consultation before seeking
an indictment which could have foreign policy overtones or
consequences.
   The spokesman acknowledged that the White House doesn't ``have
veto power'' over a Justice Department decision to seek an
indictment.
   ``However, this is a matter that has foreign policy
implications,'' the spokesman said. ``We want to review it for that
reason and we certainly would make our views known to the Justice
Department.''
   Fitzwater would not specify why the White House thought the
indictment of the deposed Philippines president would be sensitive.
   But he did say ``it is a matter that, as you know, the
circumstances in which he left the Philippines, that he has been
given certain assurances by the United States in regard to that
departure.''
   ``And he also still has influence and contacts in that part of
the world,'' Fitzwater added, ``so there are any number of foreign
policy issues that need to be considered.''
   Asked whether Marcos had been assured by U.S. officials that he
would not be indicted in this country when he fled the Philippines
in 1986, the spokesman replied, ``I don't know what assurances he
was given.''
   ``I think this is a routine request and not a specific one,''
Fitzwater said.
   He told a reporter that one reason the White House was seeking
consultations with the Justice Department is that President Reagan
and top officials were blind-sided by the indictments handed up by
federal grand juries in Tampa and Miami, Fla., against Panamanian
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``It's mostly an internal thing,'' the spokesman said. Fitzwater
said that staff members of the National Security Council had been
aware of the plan to indict Noriega, but had not made this known to
superiors.
   ``It was clear that we needed to strengthen the process to make
sure those kinds of things are brought to the full attention of the
NSC,'' which Reagan heads.
   The Village Voice said Wednesday Giuliani recommended that
Marcos and his wife be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in
connection with owning prime Manhattan real estate.
   The Justice Department is expected to ask the president to
approve the indictment this week, the weekly newspaper reported,
noting that a five-year statute of limitations on some charges is
due to expire on July 18.
   Giuliani's office declined to comment on the report.
   The Associated Press reported last month that federal
prosecutors were reviewing proposed charges that Marcos and his
wife Imelda conspired to loot the Philippines government over two
decades.
   The charges reportedly sought by Giuliani stem from Marcos'
once-secret ownership of the Crown building, the Herald Center
shopping mall and an office building at 40 Wall Street, among
others.
   Sources told the Voice that the case also will involve charges
that Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi assisted in a
fraudulent transaction designed to conceal the fact that Marcos
owned the property.
   If indicted, the Marcoses, now living in Hawaii, would face
criminal charges in U.S. courts for the first time. And if
convicted, they and other defendants could face substantial prison
sentences and large fines.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said Tuesday evening that Marcos
had not been told of the Village Voice report.
   ``This thing is purely legal and I would like to consult the
president before commenting on it,'' Trinidad said.
   The Marcoses previously have denied any wrongdoing in connection
with the New York properties.

   It means, my friends, that we've got to end the disgrace and the
shame of homelessness in the United States of America and we're
going to do that. We're going to do that. We know why we have
homeless people in this country today and we didn't have them 10
years ago, because we've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment
of affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And
nobody's going to tell me that a nation as wealthy as this, a
nation as affluent as this, a nation fundamentally as caring as
this cannot build decent and affordable housing for all of our
citizens.
   It means that we're going to need, beginning in January of 1989,
an attorney general of the United States who is determined to end
racism and sexism and discrimination in America, and I mean end it
once and for all _ an attorney general who believes in enforcing
the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Restoration Act and the
Fair Housing Act amendments of 1988 _ an attorney general that you
and I can be proud of.
   And it means that we've got to elect a president of the United
States who knows how to balance a budget and build a strong economy
and create those good jobs, and has done it; a president knows how
to create jobs and to save jobs, and has done it; a president who
will work with the Congress and the governors and mayors and
community leaders and all of you all across America to build a
future of good jobs and full employment for all of our citizens _
and I mean full employment _ a good job at decent wages for every
adult citizen who's ready and willing to work; a president with the
strength and the vision and the values to get this nation moving
again. And don't let anyone tell you that we can't do it. I've
balanced nine budgets in a row. I'm in the process of balancing a
tenth. My state has one of the hottest economies in the country.
And unemployment for minority citizens in my state has dropped by
50 percent in the past four years. And yes, while I'm proud of the
fact that my state has a minority unemployment rate of 5.5 percent,
my friends, I am not going to be satisfied until there is no
minority unemployment rate in my state and in the United States of
America, none whatsoever.
   Now, we've accomplished this, not only because we've worked hard
and invested, we've accomplished it because we've involved people.
And I'm proud of the way we've made that progress. By doubling
minority representation in state government, by being one of the
few states in the country that has a minority set-aside program
whose goals are not only being met, we're exceeding them, by
establishing a permanent commission on minority business
development; above all _ you may applaud if you would like. Above
all, we've made progress by working together, white and black and
brown, business and labor, educators and public officials, and
community leaders and just plain citizens, sharing responsibility,
sharing progress, building a sense of community and of teamwork and
confidence about the future.
   Isn't it about time we had that kind of partnership in the White
House? I think it is _ I think it is. Isn't it about time we
stopped waiting for opportunity to trickle down from a few
privileged neighborhoods into our urban centers and small towns of
rural America? Isn't it about time we told the sharp operators and
the inside traders and the dishonest contractors that their day in
the sun is over, and that a new day in this country is about to
begin? I think so, and so do you. And isn't it about time that we
restored in this country and in our government decency and
principle respect for the law of the highest offices of our land.
You know, my friends, respect for the law is the most basic, the
most conservative, and the most important principle of our
democratic society, and it must begin at the top in the White
House, in the Defense Department, and in the Justice Department of
the United States of America.

<HEAD>Horse-Washing Raises Some Nagging Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some people are complaining that Jennifer
Schaffer is allowed to clean her horses _ despite a water shortage
_ at the Main Street coin-operated car wash.
   But Mayor Charles Hardy says the horse-washing is legal,
provided that Ms. Schaffer pays for the privilege.
   ``In my thinking, as long as they pay to use the meter, they can
wash their dishes there,'' Hardy said. ``I just want them to pick
up any residue the horses may leave behind.''
   Last week, because of the drought, Hardy ordered residents to
stop watering lawns, washing their cars at home and filling pools.
But his mandate allowed the car wash to continue operating in this
southern Ohio village of 1,000, about 50 miles south of Columbus.
   Hardy said those who complained didn't realize that ``it's
perfectly legal for her (Ms. Shaffer) to do this.''
   Ms. Schaffer said she decided to wash the family's prize quarter
horses at the car wash because of convenience. It costs $1.50 to
$2.25 each time she washes a horse.
   ``It's easier. I don't have to drag out the equipment,'' she
said.
   The horse-washing has raised eyebrows among some area residents
in the face of the water use restrictions imposed last week.
   ``Looks like there's a loophole,'' said Neil McCalla, who lives
just outside the village limits. ``Nobody ever said anything about
washing horses.''
   Ginny Allison said the wash should be for cars only.
   ``There's a water shortage. Some people here don't have enough
water. It's a waste,'' she said.
   But Marcine Daughtery, who was washing her clothes at the
village coin-operated laundry, said the idea has its merits.
   ``I just might bring my 200 hogs. I'd herd them through and then
go through myself,'' she said.

<HEAD>Drought Pressuring Livestock Producers, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought and burning heat have already squeezed
livestock producers and could hurt them further if conditions
persist much longer, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   ``Rising costs brought on by drought are affecting livestock and
poultry producers' returns,'' the department's Economic Research
Service said. ``Also, poor pasture and range conditions are
reducing forage supplies for cattle and lamb producers.''
   The report added: ``If the drought continues, hog and cattle
slaughter may be boosted, adding to already-record red meat and
poultry supplies.''
   Market prices of cattle dropped in June, following record high
levels during the spring, and likely resulted, in part, from large
meat supplies, the report said.
   ``Feeder cattle prices weakened in response to lower fed cattle
prices and rising feed costs,'' it said. ``While lower feeder
cattle prices reduce returns to cow-calf producers, the more
immediate problem is poor pasture and water conditions.''
   Although hay cut from land idled under federal programs has
helped, there will be more pressure to reduce the cattle inventory
if pastures continue to deteriorate, the report said.
   Total production of red meat and poultry in 1988 is expected to
rise 3 percent to a record 59.9 billion pounds, but all of the gain
will be from pork, lamb and mutton and poultry.
   Beef production this year was forecast at 22.9 billion pounds,
down 2 percent from last year.

<HEAD>NIH Official Sees Little Chance That New AIDS Drugs Will Be
Overlooked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent staff additions at the National
Institutes of Health have reduced the chance that potentially
helpful new AIDS drugs could be overlooked, a top health official
told Congress Wednesday.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, coordinator of AIDS research for all of
the federal institutes, said ``We feel we will be able to mount a
good effort'' with the staff now available.
   Fauci, who also heads the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, had acknowledged under congressional
questioning in spring that reviews of some requests for approval of
drug studies was delayed by staff shortages.
   Vice President George Bush quoted Fauci last month as saying
money approved for AIDS research activities at the institutes is
about right.
   ``Which is right?'' demanded Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   Fauci replied that both were, that he received additional hiring
authority soon after the spring hiring that has allowed him to
recruit 20 additional reseachers for the remainder of the current
budget year and allow him to add 19 more during the fiscal year
that starts Oct. 1.
   But even with additional manpower to handle more research, Fauci
cautioned against raising expectations for substantial advances on
AIDS treatment drugs or vaccines.
   He agreed with Food and Drug Commissioner Frank Young, who
testified earlier, that the overwhelming majority of potential
drugs that someone might consider useful are ruled out in the
preliminary stages of actual testing.
   Young, for example, noted that the late actor Rock Hudson, who
died of AIDS, went to France to obtain an unapproved drug that many
people with the disease believed effective.
   ``That drug is not looked at now as a promising drug,'' Young
said, pointing out that preliminary tests in the United States
demonstrated that it was not really effective.
   Fauci said researchers walk a thin line between exploring every
avenue for an effective drug and giving proper time to those that
are most promising. He told Kennedy that NIH researchers give
consideration to approving studies if there is ``even a reasonable
chance'' the drug will prove safe and effective.
   But he said ``many get touted in newspapers'' that do not meet
that standard.
   ``The public might get misled when it reads in newspapers that a
drug is promising,'' said Fauci.
   The NIH is responsible for approving clinical testing of new
drugs where federal money is involved and works with the FDA in
developing testing protocals. The FDA has final authority on
whether to approve a new drug for marketing, or for widespread
distribution just short of full market approval.
   Although nearly 40 drugs or combinations of possible AIDS drugs
are in various stages of study, none has shown enough promise to
warrant their developers to apply to the FDA for market approval.

<HEAD>Kitty Dukakis and Beryl Ann Bentsen Campaign Together For First
Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They met for the first time just a day earlier
but Kitty Dukakis and Beryl Ann Bentsen could have passed for old
friends Wednesday as they appeared together at a luncheon held by
the National Democratic Women's Club.
   ``It has been quite a 24 hours,'' Mrs. Dukakis, wife of likely
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, told a throng of female
supporters. ``As you can imagine, 24 hours ago we didn't know each
other.''
   Only a day earlier, at 6:30 a.m., Dukakis phoned Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen to offer him the second spot on the Democratic
ticket. After Bentsen joined Dukakis in Boston for the
announcement, the two, along with their wives, flew to Washington
for a whirlwind of joint appearances.
   Mrs. Dukakis, freed of her neck brace a day earlier, appeared
well-rested and without pain at the reception held in the historic
Victorian mansion.
   She was lavish in her praise of the Texas senator.
   ``Yesterday, my husband described Senator Bentsen's record this
past legislative year as a legislative grand slam,'' she said. ``On
virtually every issue of importance to working families, Lloyd
Bentsen was there in the lead.''
   Taking a swipe at Vice President George Bush, the
all-but-certain Republican nominee, Mrs. Dukakis said her husband
``didn't want to choose someone who was going to be a silent
partner. I think we've had enough of that lately.''
   Mrs. Bentsen, making her debut on the presidential campaign
stump, praised Massachusetts' first couple.
   ``You can appreciate why Mike and Kitty Dukakis have won the
hearts of millions of Americans in the nomination of our party,''
she said. ``Their commitment to equality and opportunity for all
Americans could not be more apparent or more important.''
   Mrs. Bentsen predicted a Democratic victory in November on a
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket and added that she was ``pleased and
impressed'' that Dukakis chose to reach out to Texas in his choice
of a running mate.
   At a press conference following their remarks, the two women
said they planned to team up frequently this fall. They said they
would be focusing on family issues in their campaign appearances.

<HEAD>Sandinista Moves _ A Sign Of Frustration Or New Wave Of
Repression?</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps it was a case of just not
wanting to take it anymore that caused the Sandinista government to
take its most dramatic diplomatic move against the United States.
   Or maybe, as an opposition group suggests, it was simply the
return to a repressive rule that had eased following the signing of
a regional peace plan.
   Either explanation was possible for the Sandinistas' surprise
move Monday ordering the expulsion of Ambassador Richard Melton and
seven U.S. Embassy diplomats. The Reagan administration responded
in kind.
   The Sandinista order came a day after one of the most massive
anti-government demonstrations in Nicaragua since the Sandinistas
came to power. It ended with security forces beating civilians and
hurling canisters of tear gas. Police said they detained 43
opposition figures.
   The government accused the American diplomats of being behind
the demonstration and of inciting unrest.
   The expulsion order also came after a week of stepped-up rebel
attacks that violate an almost 4-month-old cease-fire.
   The Sandinistas expressed their outrage at the raids by the
U.S.-backed rebels, which killed at least eight civilians and
several dozen soldiers.
   In a clear reversal of recent democratic reforms, the
Sandinistas also shut down the Roman Catholic radio station on
Monday and suspended the only opposition newspaper, La Prensa, for
15 days.
   The Democratic Coordinate, an umbrella group of anti-government
organizations and political parties, claimed security agents were
rounding up dissidents in various Nicaraguan cities.
   The anti-Sandinista group charged the government was
``developing a wave of repression.''
   Relations between Nicaragua and the United States have been
strained at least since 1981, almost two years after the
Sandinistas came to power.
   The Reagan administration has financed the rebels, or Contras,
in the war to overthrow the Sandinistas. The CIA mined Nicaraguan
harbors. American planes fly reconnaisance and rebel resupply
flights in Nicaraguan territory. And the U.S. government ignored a
1986 World Court decision to reimburse Nicaragua for damages.
   The United States cut off aid to Nicaragua in 1981, blocked
loans and enacted a trade embargo in 1985. Bilateral talks to
resolve the problems were last held in 1984 despite repeated
requests for renewal by the Sandinistas.
   Washington claims the Marxist-led Sandinistas represent a threat
to U.S. national security interests by serving as a beachhead for
communism and aiding the Marxist rebels fighting the U.S.-backed
government in El Salvador.
   Nonetheless, the two nations maintain weak diplomatic relations.
The U.S. Embassy in Nicaragua frequently entertains opposition
figures and handles visa applications.
   Almost a year ago, in a move that took Washington off guard, the
nations in the region _ Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras
and Costa Rica _ signed a plan designed to end civil wars and
hostilities among the Central American nations.
   Nicaragua moved quickly to comply, but critics said it had the
furthest to go.
   The Sandinistas also had the most to gain _ a U.S. congressional
refusal to continue funding the Contras.
   The government in Nicaragua authorized the return of three
exiled priests, permitted several media outlets to reopen,
including Radio Catolica and La Prensa. In January the government
lifted the state of emergency that barred many basic freedoms.
   The Sandinista government also backed down on its position to
never hold talks with the Contras. Three days of face-to-face
meetings in March ended with a cease-fire agreement. A series of
talks held amid mutual mistrust broke off June 9, but each side
vowed to maintain the truce.
   The Sandinistas say they want the talks to continue. Almost
seven years of war have claimed more than 26,000 lives and
shattered the economy.
   Opposition groups began holding marches, all with prior
government approval as required, after the state of emergency was
lifted. Most of the demonstrations were against measures to repair
the battered economy.
   None of the earlier demonstrations was quashed with the violence
used Sunday.
   Opposition figures were refused permission to hold a ``Hunger
March'' on Saturday, two days before the Sandinistas mark their
ninth anniversary with a huge celebration in Juigalpa, 85 miles
east of the capital. The government said the opposition march could
take place July 24.
   But by closing the opposition newspaper for 15 days, the
government is preventing La Prensa from covering the July 19
anniversary or the anti-government demonstration.

<HEAD>Surgeons Perform First Double Liver Transplant in U.S., Hospital
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeons divided the liver of one child and
transplanted it into two infants in the first double liver
transplant performed in the United States, a hospital spokesman
said Wednesday.
   In the two transplants, spanning about 12 hours Tuesday, the
liver of a 1-year-old Illinois youngster who had died in an
accident was divided and transplanted into a 7 month-old girl and a
12-week-old boy, said University of Chicago Medical Center
spokesman John Easton.
   ``It worked out well. The two segments that came from the one
donated liver worked well for the two people who needed them,'' he
said.
   The infants were in critical and stable condition Wednesday.
   Double liver transplants have been performed previously in
Europe, involving adult donors, but no double liver transplants
have been done previously in the United States, he said.
   The 12-week-old boy, Joseph Kovach, of Geneva, Ill., weighs only
4.2 pounds and is the smallest infant ever to get a liver
transplant, Easton said.
   He was born with neonatal cirrhosis, a type of liver damage that
exists at birth from an unknown cause, Easton said.
   The girl, Jaclyn Manrose, of Crystal Lake, Ill., had a
hereditary defect called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, a
deficiency of an enzyme that can lead to hepatitis or cirrhosis,
Easton said.
   ``Kovach was the more urgent of the two,'' he said.
   His operation was performed by Dr. Christoff Broelsch, professor
of surgery and head of liver transplantation at the medical center,
Easton said. Dr. Jean Emond, assistant professor of surgery,
operated on Manrose.
   ``They (the doctors) got the liver about 10:45 Monday night,''
Easton said. ``Surgery bagan around 7:30 the next morning. Emond
did the transplant on Manrose. During the early stages of that,
Broelsch separated the liver. While Emond was completing his
operation, Broelsh did the transplant on Kovach.''
   At a news conference Wednesday, Kathleen and Bob Manrose said
they had no qualms about approving the experimental surgery for
their daughter, who has a 5-year-old brother and a twin sister, and
were just glad a donor organ was available.
   ``Megan wants her sister back,'' Mrs. Manrose said.
   The other set of parents, Patty and Donald Kovach, did not
attend the news conference because their son went back to surgery
Wednesday afternoon to correct a bleeding problem, Easton said.
   ``Kovach has some other medical complications,'' Easton said.
``He has already had open-heart surgery, in additon to needing a
liver.''
   Donor livers are in short supply in the United States, where an
estimated 475 people are awaiting liver transplants, many of them
children who will die without new organs.
   Broelsch has previously done transplants in which he pared down
an adult liver for a child, a procedure that other experts have
said could help offset the shortage for youngsters.

<HEAD>Strike At Largest Steel Mill; Government Warns Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZENICA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,500 workers went on strike
Wednesday at Yugoslavia's largest steel mill to protest drastic
wage cuts and other government austerity measures, the official
news agency Tanjug reported.
   Employees working at blast furnaces walked out in the early
morning hours in protest of low pay in July, Tanjug said. It gave
no details.
   Communist Party leaders, worried about increasing social
tensions, also warned protesters not to demand radical change in
the political system.
   The steel mill employs about 18,000 workers in this central
Yugoslav town. It was built after World War II and served as a
symbol of communist industrial development until it began losing
money in recent years.
   Many strikes have taken place since the government introduced an
economic program in may that combined substantial price hikes and
pay reductions. The austerity measures spurred a further decline in
living standards, which have fallen by at least one-third since
1980.
   Austerity plans worked out with the International Monetary Fund,
are intend to curb annual inflation of 175 percent and help
Yugoslavia repay its $21 billion foreign debt by making the economy
more market-oriented.
   The Communist Party Presidium said the country ``has no
alternative'' but to continue the austerity program despite
widespread protests. ``Workers' discontent does not have only a
social background, but also a very visible political component,''
said a statement carried Wednesday by official media.
   It also warned against increasingly open clashes between
leaderships of different Yugoslav republics and provinces and the
resulting public demonstrations. The Presidium said workers'
problems should be solved within their factories rather than in the
streets.
   Workers have held several protest marches to air airing their
grievances about the austerity measures and alleged corruption in
the leadership. They have chanted such slogans as ``Down with
Communism!'' and ``Down with the government!''
   They also have demanded free elections, independent trade unions
and the curbing of privileges accorded party officials.
   Thousands of workers from a large shoe factory stormed the
Parliament building in Belgrade last week.
   Yugoslavia had a record 1,600 strikes last year involving
300,000 workers.

<HEAD>Soviets Due Thursday for Second Round of INF Inspections</HEAD>

   Forty Soviets were to arrive Thursday for the
next round of inspections to assure compliance with the treaty on
destruction of superpower medium-range nuclear missiles, a U.S.
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Four Soviet teams of 10 people each were to arrive aboard a
special Ilyushin 62 jet shortly after 5 p.m. at Dulles
International Airport near Washington, said Cmdr. Kendall Pease,
spokesman for the On-Site Inpection Agency.
   That agency conducts inspections in the Soviet Union of sites
covered under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty
signed at the Washington summit last December.
   Between four and 48 hours after their arrival, the Soviets were
to notify U.S. authorities which of five locations they intended to
inspect: a Martin Marietta Corp. plant in Baltimore; Cape
Canaveral, Fla.; the Redstone rocket research center at Huntsville,
Ala; Fort Sill, Okla.; or the Longhorn Army Depot at Marshall,
Texas, said Pease.
   Five Soviet teams arrived on the West Coast at the beginning of
this month to inspect INF sites there. A 23-member Soviet team
arrived on July 2 in Magna, Utah, to prepare a permanent inspection
station at the Hercules Plant No. 1, where U.S. missiles were
produced.
   During the same period, 12 U.S. teams under the command of Army
Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie inspected 33 INF sites in the Soviet
Union, Pease said. The U.S. side is to visit 133 sites within a
60-day ``baseline inspection'' period to verify the exact number of
missiles and related components to be destroyed under the treaty.
   The Soviet side is to inspect 26 sites in the same period, the
spokesman said.

<HEAD>UTC Chief Denies Corporation Involvement In Alleged Bribes To
Paisley</HEAD>

   The head of United Technologies Corp. on
Wednesday said the defense contractor has ``absolutely no
knowledge'' of alleged bribes paid to consultant Melvyn R. Paisley,
a key figure in the Pentagon procurement investigation.
   Robert F. Daniell, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Hartford, Conn., defense giant, said in a letter sent to UTC
employees that the company remains ``reluctant to comment on
specific allegations until the investigations are completed and all
the facts are known.''
   But Daniell told employees that ``it is important to respond to
press reports on court documents suggesting'' that Paisley received
bribes from Pratt & Whittney officials while he was a high-ranking
Navy official.
   Court documents released late last week said government agents
believed unnamed Pratt & Whitney officials paid Paisley bribes
during his tenure as assistant Navy secretary. Pratt & Whitney, a
major builder of military and commercial jet engines, is an
operating unit of United Technologies.
   ``While our own internal investigation is still in progress, I
can tell you that we know of no improper payment by the corporation
or its employees, directly or indirectly, to any government
employee,'' Daniell wrote.
   ``UTC has absolutely no knowledge of payments of any kind by the
corporation or any of its employees to Mr. Paisley or his wife,
except under the terms of a written consulting agreement properly
entered into after he left government service,'' Daniell said.
   Paisley was hired by UTC and other defense contractors last year
after he retired from the Navy.
   Federal investigators are looking into allegations that
consultants and defense contractors bribed Defense Department
officials for contracting information to help win lucrative
military contracts.
   United Technologies has been tight-lipped about the
investigation. The only other public comment was a June 22 letter
to employees denying knowledge of any wrongdoing.
   The first letter followed publication of an FBI warrant used to
search Pratt & Whitney's corporate headquarters in Washington. The
document said that agents believed Pratt & Whitney possessed copies
of sensitive contract proposal information from General Electric
Co. on engine contracts for the F-18 fighter bomber and the V-22
tilt-rotor aircraft.
   A warrant used to search Paisley's McLean, Va., home, disclosed
last week, went further, saying agents believed Paisley received
bribes from Pratt & Whitney in connection with the V-22 engine
contract.
   UTC spokesman Larry Bingaman said corporate executives ``felt we
should speak out and set the record straight'' on the Paisley-bribe
allegations, but that their policy of not discussing the
investigation would remain in place.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns Remains Of 25 U.S. Servicemen</HEAD>

   U.S. officials in Hanoi accepted what
are believed to be the remains of 25 Americans killed in Vietnam
and the caskets were put on a military plane for the trip to the
United States, the U.S. Embassy said.
   It was one of the largest returns of remains. U.S. forces left
Vietnam in 1973 after losing 58,000 soldiers in combat, and the war
ended with a Communist victory in April 1975.
   In the North Vietnamese capital, American officials were to
begin talks Thursday on the possible resettlement in the United
States of thousands of Vietnamese political prisoners who helped
the United States during the war.
   Honor guards loaded the 25 caskets, each topped with a folded
American flag, onto a C-141 transport plane at Noi Bai Airport.
After a 25-minute ceremony the plane left for Honolulu, where Army
experts will try to confirm Vietnam's preliminary identifications,
the embassy said.
   U.S. officials said the Vietnamese provided a list of 25 names,
some of which are on the official list of 1,761 Americans still
listed as missing in action. Vietnam also gave other information
related to the servicemen, many of whom were shot down while
bombing missions.
   Vietnamese officials entrusted the remains to a 23-member team
from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central
Identification Laboratory, both based in Honolulu.
   Retired Gen. John W. Vessey, a special presidential envoy,
negotiated an agreement in August 1987 under which Vietnam pledged
to speed its accounting of the missing Americans.
   The Vietnamese hgave returned more than 150 containers of
remains since the war ended. The largest return was April 6 _ the
remains of what were believed to have been 27 Americans, and those
of three ethnic Asians who might have been missing Americans.
   In exchange for Vietnam's cooperation, Washington has encouraged
private humanitarian agencies to help the former enemy with medical
problems, including rehabilitation of veterans disabled in the war
with the United States.
   Washington has no diplomatic relations with Hanoi.
   Robert L. Funseth, a deputy assistant secretary of state for
refugee programs, went to Hanoi on Wednesday to persuade Vietnam to
allow the emigration of some of the 900,000 former U.S. government
employees or officials of the South Vietnam government who were
interned in ``re-education camps.'' Most of the political prisoners
were detained for their U.S. ties, State Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said in Washington.
   Vietnam freed hundreds of former South Vietnamese officials in
mass amnesties in September 1987 and last February. Phan Quang, the
vice minister of information, has said only 150 former officials
still are held and they may be freed soon.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said the former prisoners could
emigrate only with a guarantee that they would not engage in
anti-Vietnam activities. U.S. officials have said this was not
possible because the U.S. government cannot dictate individual
conduct.

   The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board has
upheld the firing of an FBI agent who was dismissed for refusing to
investigate a group opposed to the Reagan administration's foreign
and military policies.
   The merit board on Tuesday ruled without comment in favor of the
FBI in its case against John C. ``Jack'' Ryan.
   ``I guess I wasn't really surprised,'' Ryan said Wednesday. ``I
would have been shocked if the decision had gone the other way.''
   Ryan, 50, was appealing the Feb. 2 decision of Administrative
Judge T. Christopher Heavrin, who rejected his claim that the
firing was unfair and constituted religious discrimination.
   A 21-year FBI veteran, Ryan lost his $50,000-a-year job just 10
months before he was eligible for retirement with full pension
benefits.
   The FBI fired Ryan last September after he refused to
investigate a group suspected of vandalizing 11 military recruiting
offices in the Chicago area in October 1986 in an anti-war protest.
   Ryan, a devout Roman Catholic, says he became a pacifist for
religious reasons in 1985 and now would never carry a firearm or
kill _ even in self defense. He denounces the administration's
policies in Central America as ``immoral activities.''
   His refusal to carry a gun is a key reason the appeal was
rejected, Ryan said.
   The FBI offered to reinstate him in December on the condition he
never speak about the case. He signed an agreement and mailed it to
FBI headquarters but the deal later collapsed.
   FBI spokesman Gregory Jones said the bureau had no comment on
the merit board's decision.
   Ryan said he is considering taking the case to federal court but
legal costs might prevent the move.
   ``I'd like to pursue it because I think it's a winnable case,''
he said. ``It's certainly a major issue.''

   Last week, we lost an attorney general, but we gained a measure
of self-respect, didn't we? We gained a measure of self-respect.
And next year with your help, we're going to clean out the whole
crew. Next year, we're going to clean out the whole crew. Next
year, we're going to have a president that who will appoint Supreme
Court justices that we can be proud of, judges like Louise Brandeis
and Thurgood Marshall. We're going to have a Civil Rights
Commission that believes in civil rights.
   We're going to have a foreign policy that reflects the values of
the American people _ (applause). We're going to stop the shooting
war in Central America, and we're going to lead a war against
poverty and in justice and exploitation throughout this hemisphere.
And my friends on the Security Council of the United Nations, we're
not going to veto international sanctions against South Africa;
we're going to sponsor them. That's what we're going to do _ that's
what we're going to do.
   We're not going to sell arms to terrorists _ we're going to
crack down on terrorists, whether they live in Beirut or Tehran or
Johannesburg. And we're not going to cut deals with a
dope-peddling, gun-running Panamanian dictator and funnel aid to
the Contras through convicted drug dealers. We're going to say
``no'' to Noriega and we're going to wage a real war and not a
phony war against drugs and drug abuse in this country because
we're going to have a president in the White House who understands
that the greatest threat to our national security in this
hemisphere is not the Sandinistas _ it's this avalance of drugs
that's pouring into our communities and poisoning our kids.
   And you're going to have a president who's done more than just
talk about crime and drugs. You're going to have a president who's
been working for years with parents and students and educators and
law enforcement officials to cut the demand for drugs. And ladies
and gentlemen, we can do all the enforcing in the world and we must
do a tough enforcement job. And as any drug enforcement officers
will tell you, if we don't do something about the demand for drugs
in this country, we're going to lose this war. We have five percent
of the world's population in the United States of America; we're
consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine. Five percent of the
world's population and 50 percent of the world's cocaine.
   So yes, we going to be enforcing the law both here and abroad.
And we're going to be doing something about drug trafficking. But
we have to set as our goal in this country drug-free schools in the
1990s in every community in America, and I mean it. And I mean it.
In my own state, we've been working for the past four years brining
drug education and prevention into the early elementary grades in
every community in my state. And we have already made an enormous
impact on drug use and abuse among young people. But that drug
education has to begin in the first, second, and third grade, and I
mean it, in every elementary school in America, and I personally
want to lead that fight with your help and with your support.
   And when I say these things to you, I say these to you not as
somebody who just talks about these things. I'm proud to say to you
that I'm the governor of a state that has had the second biggest
drop in crime of any state in this country in the past five years,
and the lowest homicide rate of any industrial state in America.
We're not going to have more rhetoric or photo opportunities in the
war against drugs. Beginning in January of 1989, we're going to get
results. That's a commitment and I promise it to you.
   Many of you will recall that in June of 1966, just two years to
the day before his assassination, Robert Kennedy also stood in
front of an audience of eager young students, some 15,000 strong.
The site was a university, the city was Cape Town, South Africa,
and his message was the same as Dr. King's in this city some 29
years ago, and this is what he said: He said, ``Few of us will have
the opportunity to bend history itself, but each of us can work to
change a small portion of events. And the total of all those acts
will be written in the history of this generation. Each time a man
or woman stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of
others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny
ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different
centers of energy and of daring, those ripples build a current
which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and of
resistance.'' My friends, the future of America doesn't depend on
some nameless, outside force, and it certainly doesn't depend on
the alignment of the stars, the future depends on us. The future
depends on us.
   The future depends on us. That's what democracy is all about.
That's what this country is all about, that's what the NAACP is all
about, and that's what this presidential campaign is all about. A
lot has happened since I addressed this same convention last year.
I know that I've learned a great deal about myself, and about the
people of this country. I know that I've never been prouder of my
party, the party that has opened up the door of opportunity to a
couple of guys named Dukakis and Jackson, the top two candidates
for our nomination.

   And I know that I have never had more confidence in the future
of this country. Together we will move forward. Together we will
help the American dream to come true for every family and every
community and every region of this land. Together we will build a
future so that when our children look back in their time on what we
did in our time, they will say that we had the courage to carry on
the dreams of those who came before us, that we had the energy and
the daring to make our own dreams come true, and that we had the
wisdom and the foresight and the compassion to open up the door of
opportunity to our children and our grandchildren in generations
yet to come.
   I'm very proud this morning to be joined by two people who
themselves have given their lives to public service. Lloyd Bentsen,
at the age of 25, challenged a political machine in South Texas and
beat them and became a county judge. Two years later he challenged
that machine again and was elected to the Congress of the United
States, the youngest member at that time to be elected to the
Congress. He was committed to civil rights and equal opportunity
way back then, way back then in the '40s. And all of you know him
today as the distinguished and able, and very effective chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee.
   And my friends, this year this man has hit a legislative grand
slam. Under his leadership, with a narrow democratic majority in
the Senate and with an administration that doesn't support any of
these things, he has successfully gotten us a responsible trade
bill _ which I hope and expect the president is going to sign,
finally. He has just steered a plant closing law through the Senate
of the United States by an overwhelming majority _ and this time I
hope the president signs it _ 60 days notice to American workers
and their families before they're thrown out of work, from an
administration that was willing to give Noriega 120 days notice. I
must say, I find it ironic, and Senator Bentsen finds it ironic,
that last week the attorney general of the United States gave
himself 30 days notice, yet the president doesn't seem to want to
give honest, hard-working American workers 60 days notice before
they're thrown out in the street.
   He has successfully steered the passage, a sweeping welfare
reform act which will help hundreds of thousands of American
families to lift themselves out of poverty. And he was the person
who led the successful fight for a catastrophic health insurance
bill which will now make it possible for senior citizens in this
country to enjoy a measure of security without wondering whether or
not illness is going to bankrupt them. And he has done all of that
in one year _ he has done all of that in one year. Those of you
from Texas know him. You've elected him and reelected him. You
admire and respect him. He is here with his lovely wife, B. A.
Bentsen, and Kitty and I have had a wonderful time this past day or
day and a half, getting to know her, and we have heard about her
from so many people who admire and respect her here and in Texas.
   So may I introduce to you a distinguished United States senator
from the state of Texas, a man who I hope you will be working for,
for the vice presidency, and man I hope to serve with in a new
administration in January of 1989, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.

   Azerbaijan quashed a territory's attempt to secede
and join Armenia, Tass reported Wednesday, creating another
stalemate in an ethnic dispute that has caused months of turmoil in
the two southern republics.
   The official news agency said the Presidium, or executive
committee, of Azerbaijan's parliament met Tuesday night and
declared ``null and void'' the declaration of secession that the
Nagorno-Karabakh legislature passed Tuesday.
   Three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's 160,000 residents are
ethnic Armenians but the enclave was made part of Azerbaijan in
1923. The argument over it became public in February and the two
neighboring Caucasus republics have been disrupted by riots,
strikes and huge demonstrations.
   Tass quoted the Azerbaijan Presidium's resolution as saying the
territory's legislature ``failed to secure strict compliance with
principles of legality'' and ``openly encroached on the
national-state composition of the republic.''
   It said only 101 of the 150 legislators were present when
secession was voted. Reporters for the radio station in the
territorial capital, Stepanakert, said Tuesday the vote was
unanimous except for one abstention.
   Vladimir V. Vaselenko, prosecutor of Nagorno-Karabakh, said in
an interview broadcast by Soviet television Wednesday that the
legislature's action violated the constitutions and laws of
Azerbaijan and the entire nation. He said one deputy who spoke at
Tuesday's session admitted that, but then voted for secession.
   The Soviet evening television news program ``Vremya'' reported
Wednesday that militiamen in Nagorno-Karabakh had confiscated
grenades, pistols, revolvers, sawed-off shotguns and ammunition
from residents in the past month.
   The declaration of secession, challenging central authority all
the way up to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was the first
such action in the Soviet Union's 70 years.
   Armenians, most of whom are Christians, consider the mountain
enclave part of their ancestral homeland. Azerbaijan is
predominantly Moslem.
   Legislators of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is slightly smaller than
Delaware, said in their declaration Tuesday it was being renamed
the Artsakh Autonomous Region of Armenia.
   It also called for an end to strikes, but Tass said they
persisted Wednesday in Stepanakert.
   ``All industrial enterprises ... remained idle on July 13,
public and city transport did not function, all shops selling
manufactured goods were closed, so were consumer service outlets,''
the agency said.
   A worker at the Stepanakert radio station said in a telephone
interview: ``The food situation has become very critical. We are
producing our own bread and milk, but other foodstuffs are lacking.
Nothing is coming to us from Azerbaijan.''
   He said, speaking on condition of anonymity, that soldiers were
in the city streets and in other parts of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In Yerevan, capital of Armenia, 120,000 people rallied to demand
the central government in Moscow approve the transfer of
Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, a reporter for the republic's official
news agency said. He said a general strike continued and quoted
speakers at a rally as saying: ``We have no other means of protest
than strikes.''
   The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh has brought it into direct
confrontation with central authorities in Moscow as well as with
Azerbaijan.
   In February, the dispute led to riots in the Sumgait,
Azerbaijan, in which at least 32 people were reported killed, 26 of
them ethnic Armenians.
   The Soviet constitution gives citizens the right of
self-determination, but requires a republic's consent for any
changes in its boundaries.
   On Feb. 20, Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature asked the Azerbaijani
and Armenian governments to approve transfer of the region to
Armenia. The Armenian legislature agreed June 15 but Azerbaijan
said no two days later.
   In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a reporter for the
republic's official news agency said the dispute was being resolved
in accordance with Gorbachev's policies of ``glasnost,'' or
openness.
   ``It's being decided in a democratic way. Some people say one
thing; others say something else,'' the reporter said in a
telephone interview, on condition his name not be used.
   Gorbachev has said more attention should be paid to concerns of
the Soviet Union's more than 100 national groups, but that some are
abusing glasnost.

<TEXT>
   The chief of the Drug Enforcement
Administration said Wednesday the government will use paraquat and
other herbicides in a stepped-up campaign to eradicate domestically
grown marijuana.
   At a news conference, DEA director John Lawn said paraquat,
which was banned from use on national forests in 1983 because of
environmental concerns, would be one of three herbicides used in
the program, Operation Stop Crop 1988.
   A DEA spokesman, Cornelius Dougherty, subsequently said that
paraquat would be used in spraying for marijuana eradication on
private land, not on public property, in light of the court ruling.
   The other two herbicides cited by Lawn _ 2, 4 d and glyphosate _
are not involved in the 1983 federal court decision and could be
used in spraying on public lands, DEA spokesman said.
   ``The other two chemicals don't have the same restrictions, but
while that may be complying with the letter of the law, it is
violating the principles that protect national lands to ensure the
protection of wildlife habitats and recreation areas,'' said Jay
Feldman, coordinator of the National Coalition Against the Misuse
of Pesticides.
   Paraquat, which is used in agriculture to clear fields before
planting and after harvest, is highly toxic and can cause serious
harm when inhaled or absorbed by human beings or animals.
   Lawn said the government must prepare an environmental impact
statement when eradication is contemplated and that ``at that
point, the determination is made by environmentalists, by law
enforcement, which chemical will be most effective.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said ``the real environmental
damage is not from'' the herbicides, but rather from what is being
done by the illegal growers of marijuana. He said the traffickers
are ``cutting down trees ... damming streams and pouring pesticides
and fertilizer'' into streams, from which water is pumped for
irrigation of the marijuana crop.
   Meese said Operation Stop Crop is designed to rid the country of
marijuana-growing efforts by drug traffickers who have in many
cases dispersed their operations into national forests and other
remote areas to avoid detection.
   Rather than run the risk of losing their privately owned land
through asset forfeiture to authorities once they are caught,
marijuana growers have moved to land owned either by the federal or
state governments.
   ``Not only are they violating the law by producing illegal drugs
on publicly owned land, they often pose a serious threat to the
safety and even lives of innocent people hiking through parks or
forests, only to stumble into the deadly booby traps set up to
protect marijuana patches,'' said Meese.
   Large growing plots were once common but were easily spotted
from the ground and air. So the trend has been to have smaller
plots, according to a report by the National Drug Policy Board, a
Cabinet-level group chaired by Meese.
   Stop Crop 1988, the first year of a long-term plan, is a
cooperative effort of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the
departments of Justice, Agriculture, Interior and agencies
including the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   The National Guard, which has provided support for knocking out
marijuana growing operations since 1983, also will provide support.
   State and local governments also are cooperating.
   The National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee has
estimated that domestically cultivated marijuana constituted some
27.8 percent of the total U.S. supply in 1987, a four-fold increase
from the 7 percent share reported in 1980.
   Law enforcement officials say domestic growth has risen in the
face of increasingly effective eradication efforts overseas plus
improved interdiction efforts by U.S. authorities at the border.

   Stung by Michael Dukakis' failure to consult him
on the selection of his running mate, Jesse Jackson has halted
pre-convention platform negotiations between their campaigns, and
is looking to Dukakis to repair the damage to their relationship, a
top adviser said Wednesday.
   The Jackson forces ``were really incredulous'' at what they
consider the snub by Dukakis who did not consult Jackson before
naming Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, said Jackson's convention manager Ron
Brown.
   ``Basically we were flabbergasted by the way this was handled,''
Brown said. ``It seems totally contrary to the kinds of open lines
of communication we were developing.''
   Brown said later Wednesday that he had spoken on three occasions
with Dukakis' campaign manager, Susan Estrich, and that she
apologized for what she said was not a deliberate foulup.
   ``If she says it, I believe it,'' he said, but added ``There
needs to be some direct contact between Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson,'' to get things back on a positive footing.
   The turn of events has the Jackson camp weighing options for its
convention demeanor. Some supporters independently have raised the
possibility of fighting the Bentsen nomination by running Jackson
for vice president.
   Jackson himself may have fueled that talk on Wednesday when he
said in Chicago, ``I'm not suggesting that I will compete for a
place on the ticket, but the floor is wide open on Thursday night
when the recommendation is made,'' for the vice presidential spot.
   And there is ``no chance'' Jackson will embrace the ticket
before Wednesday's formal vote in which Jackson's name will be put
in nomination against Dukakis for the presidential nod, said Brown.
   Key Jackson backers are not expressing dissatisfaction with
Bentsen himself but rather with the way the choice was presented to
Jackson as a fait accompli.
   Brown said Dukakis official Paul Brountas had assured him early
on that Dukakis would run his selection by Jackson. But instead
Jackson learned of the choice from reporters when his plane landed
in Washington on Tuesday. He received a telephone call from Dukakis
informing him of the news about an hour later, Jackson said.
   Bert Lance, the former Carter Administration official who is
close to Jackson, said he would find it incredible if the slight
was intentional.
   ``If that was intentional, it was the biggest mistake they will
make,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Brown and the two advisers who attended Jackson's meeting Monday
with Brountas, former Democratic National Committee Chairman John
White and Howard University political scientist Ron Walters, said
Brountas clearly indicated Jackson was still being actively
considered for the second spot on the ticket.
   But two other sources said Brountas told Jackson that day that
he was not to be chosen, although the running mate had not yet been
decided.
   At a news conference in Washington Wednesday, Dukakis said he
apologized to Jackson on Tuesday for not reaching him with a
personal phone call about the vice presidential choice before a
reporter revealed the decision to Jackson.
   ``I told him how sorry I was I hadn't been able to get through
to him,'' Dukakis said. He said he failed to reach another
also-ran, Ohio Sen. John Glenn, before the news got out.
   Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., a member of the Black Congressional
Caucus that met with Dukakis and Bentsen on Wednesday, said the way
Jackson learned of the No. 2 choice was ``a demonstration of
disrespect.''
   But some of Jackson's congressional backers appeared eager for a
harmonious convention and made a point of describing Bentsen as a
good choice.
   ``Lots of fences have been mended,'' said Rep. Mervyn Dymally,
D-Calif., chairman of the caucus following the meeting with Dukakis
and Bentsen. ``We have a very fruitful discussion about the
convention, the campaign and the presidency.''
   Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., one of the highest ranking black in
Congress as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, urged
Jackson supporters to rally around the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   Gray said American blacks face ``four more years of civil rights
retrenchment'' if Vice President George Bush wins the presidency
and urged Jackson supporters to ``keep their eyes on the prize.''
   ``I believe most black Americans understand the choice is
between Dukakis and Bush, that they are far more sophisticated than
some people give them credit for,'' Gray said.
   And even Owens urged Dukakis to reach out to Jackson.
   ``We'd like to see a troika ... a demonstration, symbolically
for American television to understand that Jesse Jackson is the
third man on this team ... He's not willing to make Jesse Jackson a
special third person on that team. He made that clear.''
   Jackson's co-chairman in California, Assemblywoman Maxine
Waters, raised the possibility of entering Jackson's name for the
vice presidential slot, although Brown said ``that is not anything
we are encouraging.''
   He declined to say what Jackson would do if that happened.
   He said decisions are up in the air about Jackson's convention
strategy, and that a lot depends on whether Dukakis tries to make
amends.
   ``You can assume we have the wherewithal to make our presence
felt on everything that happens at the convention,'' he added.
   Jackson officials had been working out compromises on platform
issues in private negotiations, but those have been halted, Brown
said.
   ``It's now up to Michael Dukakis to make it a unity
convention,'' by reaching out to Jackson. Jackson on Tuesday
repeated his earlier vow to support the Democratic ticket but was
non-committal on how much he would press is supporters to work for
the ticket in November, saying he would wait to see how the
convention turned out.
   Later in the day, he emphasized:
   ``It just seems to us that it would have been an absolute
priority on a matter this important and this sensitive for there to
have been direct contact with Jesse Jackson and his campaign prior
to any information being disseminated.''

   Some 500 descendants of William Rittenhouse,
who came to the New World in 1688, are gathering this weekend to
celebrate being part of a family that boasts famous scientists,
doctors and businessmen.
   Harold Rittenhouse, a 10th generation direct descendant and
chairman of the Rittenhouse Tricentennial Reunion, said his
forefather _ the first Mennonite minister in America _ would be
taken aback by the celebration.
   ``Being a simple person, it would have been a little bit
overwhelming for him to come to a reunion like this,'' Rittenhouse
said.
   Family members from 26 states and Canada are expected to attend.
   William Rittenhouse was born Wilhelm Rettinghaus in Germany in
1644. He went to Holland, where he may have learned his trade of
papermaking, before coming to America, in part to escape religious
prejudice in Europe.
   He built what's recognized as the first paper mill in America in
1690 as part of a colonial village called RittenhouseTown, in what
is now Fairmount Park in Philadelphia.
   He became a Mennonite minister, preaching from a church in
Germantown.
   He had three children, two daughters and son, before he died,
crippled from the back-breaking labor of working the mill, in 1708.
   The family spans 12 generations and claims as many as 40,000
members, including admirals, governors, senators and judges.
   David Rittenhouse, a great-grandson, was a leading astronomer,
mathematician and clockmaker in colonial times. A Philadelphian who
knew Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, he became the first
director of the United States Mint in 1792.
   Other descendants include Maj. Gen. William Crawford Gorgas, a
physician who helped conquer yellow fever, and Raymond Rubicam, one
of the fathers of modern advertising.
   The Rittenhouse story is documented in the last family history
written in 1893, also the year of the last large reunion.
   ``The possibility of updating or redoing our family history is a
strong inducement for me,'' Rittenhouse said. ``People say they
have family memorabilia.
   ``We've had people say something like we have a deed from
RittenhouseTown,'' he said. ``One person from Texas said they have
a grand piano that has been in the Rittenhouse family.''
   Rittenhouse began planning for the reunion in 1987 and sent out
more than 2,000 invitations. He was pleased with the expected
turnout of about 500 family members.
   ``Being the 300-year-reunion is a drawing card on its own _ just
being part of something like that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   State regulators filed formal charges of
misrepresentation Wednesday against an insurance company that sold
1,500 Iowa farmers policies covering this year's drought.
   Insurance Commissioner William Hager said farmers paid an
average of $1,000 each when they applied for the coverage but the
company issued only four of the policies. He did not estimate the
total value of the policies.
   Hager said he would try to force the company, Federal Insurance
Co., to live up to the terms of the policies it sold, or force it
to return double the premiums farmers paid. He added that he might
seek civil penalties, which could range up to $50,000.
   Insurance commissioners in Minnesota, Indiana and Ohio have said
they're investigating the drought insurance policies the company, a
subsidiary of the Chubb Group Insurance Cos. of Warren, N.J., wrote
this year.
   Officials in Minnesota and Indiana warned that Chubb could lose
its license to do business in those states if if did not provide
the coverage.
   A group of 42 neighboring farmers in Tennessee and Kentucky
demanded on Tuesday that the company honor $3 million in drought
policies that they bought.
   Chubb Group spokeswoman Mary Lu Korkuch said Wednesday the
company is working with state insurance commissioners to develop
solutions.
   The company, she said, had set aside $30 million to cover the
drought policies and had reached that amount of coverage before the
June 15 cutoff date for purchase of the insurance.
   Chubb officials met Wednesday with Michigan Insurance Bureau
officials in Lansing to explain that one of Federal's agents had
violated his authority and, with the help of unlicensed agents,
sold at least 9,000 policies, thousands more than the company had
approved.
   ``It's one of the most bizarre scenarios I've ever seen. ...
It's like science fiction,'' said Eric Nordman, director of
property and liability for the Michigan bureau.
   ``It seems that one agent who developed a computer program for
weather predictions went amok and had lots of unlicensed people
selling insurance on his behalf,'' Nordman said.
   The drought insurance policies, designed to pay damages for
abnormally low rainfall, were advertised in Iowa in early June when
this year's drought was worsening.
   ``It's pretty predictable they would have a significant number
of applications,'' Hager said. ``I'm not sure fraud is part of this
situation. I doubt whether there was a clear understanding of the
level of interest in these policies.''
   The company, Hager said, directed its agents to solicit as many
policies as possible when it ``it knew or should have known that
the company lacked adequate financial resources and reinsurance to
write all of the coverage solicited.''
   The insurance coverage was marketed as drought insurance but
``the product in question is actually a `weather' policy, whereby
benefits are based solely on the amount of rainfall in a given
area'' between June 1 and Aug. 31.
   ``It has nothing to do with crop yields,'' Hager said.
   A hearing on the administrative charges has been set for July
25, Hager said. Regulators in Indiana have set a hearing for the
following day.

   Journalists arrested in the line of duty at
the Democratic National Convention need only pick up the phone for
free legal help from an Atlanta law firm.
   A 24-hour hotline, operated by the firm of Federal & Todd, will
provide credential-carrying reporters with free legal advice and
representation if needed while covering the convention.
   The hotline, arranged by The Reporters Committee with the
cooperation of the Atlanta Bureau of Police Services, is intended
to minimize problems faced by reporters covering demonstrations or
other newsworthy events.
   Mass arrests have occasionally resulted from major disturbances
during past political conventions, and journalists have been taken
into custody.

   Unisys Corp., one of the defense contractors
enmeshed in the Pentagon bribery probe, is cooperating in a
separate federal criminal investigation of the company's work at
the Army Information Systems Command in Fort Huachuca, Ariz., a
spokesman for the firm said Wednesday.
   Unisys spokesman Peter Hynes acknowledged that the investigation
is under way and sources familiar with it, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say it is being conducted by the U.S. attorney's office
in Tucson, Ariz.
   Hynes said Unisys performs computer software maintenance at the
location in Arizona.
   The systems command is a global telecommunications network for
the Army that employs 40,000 civilians and military personnel and
it is headquartered in Fort Huachuca.
   The Wall Street Journal, which disclosed the investigation in
Wednesday editions, said the probe involves alleged overcharges
that may amount to $10 million on computer work performed for the
Army.
   Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., also is deeply involved in the
massive Pentagon bribery probe, which is a separate investigation
from the Fort Huachuca matter.
   The government in the Pentagon bribery probe is delving into the
activities of former Unisys vice president-turned-consultant
Charles Gardner.
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell declined to comment on
the probe involving the systems command.

<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday pressed ahead
with the trial of a Palestinian whose detention may have provoked a
cruise ship massacre and said it would not allow Greece to become
an arena for terrorist battles.
   A previously unknown group linked with Palestinians claimed
responsibility for Monday's attack on the City of Poros cruise
ship. The Organization of the Martyrs of the Popular Revolution in
Palestine, took responsibility in a statement delivered Wednesday
to a Western news agency in west Beirut.
   Radio France-Inter in Paris, meanwhile, reported that an
anonymous caller said in a rambling conversation that the
pro-Iranian group Islamic Jihad carried out the attack to avenge
the U.S. downing of an Iranian passenger plane.
   There was no way to authenticate either claim.
   The PLO has condemned the attack on the City of Poros.
   Tourists were sunbathing and strolling on the ship's deck Monday
when several terrorists pulled machine guns and began shooting and
throwing hand grenades. Nine people were killed, and 98 were
wounded.
   Merchant Marine Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos told Parliament
Wednesday that the terrorists returned to shore in rescue boats and
had not escaped in a waiting speedboat as police initially
reported. Many vessels rushed to the ship's aid and rescued
panicked passengers who had jumped overboard to escape the attack.
   An Athens radio station reported that one of the terrorists was
a woman who received treatment in the hospital for a foot injury
after the attack.
   The station identified her as Aysal Lampsalmi, a Moroccan
passport-holder, and said she checked out of the Tzanneion Hospital
in Piraeus on Monday night with other survivors who sustained
slight injuries.
   Greek authorities believe the guerrillas who carried out the
attack may have intended to hijack the ship to win freedom for
Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian.
   Rashid is wanted by the U.S. government for allegedly planting a
bomb on a Pan Am jet in 1982 that killed one person and injured 15.
   He is charged in Greece with entering the country on a forged
passport. His trial had been delayed until the end of July, but
Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas overruled that decision
Wednesday and ordered proceedings to begin.
   Rashid told reporters at the courthouse that he was not a
terrorist and claimed the ship attack was ``an American operation
... to distract attention from the shooting down of the Iranian
plane and the Palestinian uprising'' against Israel's occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The Americans can say what they like ... I had nothing to do
with anything,'' he said.
   Rashid's trial was held over until Thursday because his lawyer
and interpreter were unavailable.
   The deputy minister for tourism, Nikos Skoulas, said Greece was
determined not to become ``an arena for different groups or
factions to settle their differences.''
   ``We are not soft or weak on anyone. That accusation has been
leveled at us,'' he added, referring to past criticism by the
United States for laxity in combating terrorism.
   Skoulas said security officers were being posted on the one-day
Greek island cruises operated by the City of Poros and other
vessels.
   Confusing and sometimes contradictory information obscured many
details about the attack.
   The statement signed by The Organization of the Martyrs of the
Popular Revolution in Palestine said the attack was ``in
retaliation for the escalation in the operations of murder and
extermination by the murderous Zionist-American gangs in Palestine,
Lebanon, the gulf and all over the world.''
   It also claimed responsibility for a car bomb that killed two
men near the liner's home dock of Piraeus about six hours before
the ship attack.
   Police speculated that automatic weapons, grenades and
explosives found in the car were intended for hijacking the ship.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, Bassam Abu Sharif, spokesman for PLO chief
Yasser Arafat, declared, ``The Palestine Liberation Organization
and the Palestinian people, being themselves victims of
state-organized terrorism, strongly condemn this criminal attack on
the Greek ship and the car bombing.''
   Security police backtracked on an earlier claim that a young
woman with a French passport was among the terrorists. But they
said a woman was still believed to be among the terrorists.
   It remained unclear how many terrorists were involved. Most
accounts by survivors and authorities varied between three and four.
   The death toll has also varied. The harbor authority initially
said 11 people died, and the coroner said there were 10 bodies. On
Wednesday, the government finally said the official death count was
nine. It said confusion apparently arose because bodies were badly
charred and some were dismembered.

<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western governments could bring
apartheid ``much nearer its death'' by imposing stiff economic
sanctions on South Africa, British opposition leader Neil Kinnock
said Wednesday.
   The Labor Party leader mentioned no names, but since his arrival
in southern Africa last Friday he has attacked Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and President Reagan for opposing sanctions.
   Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher argue that South African blacks and
neighboring black-ruled states would suffer most from such measures.
   Kinnock is on a four-nation tour and met on Wednesday with
President Quett Masire at the end of a three-day visit to Botswana,
which borders South Africa.
   ``I am greatly impressed by the progress in this peaceful,
prosperous democracy,'' he said of Botswana, which has held regular
elections and built one of Africa's fastest-growing economies in 21
years of independence.
   He praised Botswana for ``demonstrating immense bravery'' by
taking a strong stand against South Africa and its apartheid
policies but acknowledged it would be ``economic suicide'' for the
landlocked country to impose sanctions on its southern neighbor.
   He added, however: ``If faraway nations that are much stronger
and much less tied to South Africa showed the same bravery,
including the imposition of sanctions ... then apartheid would be
much nearer its death.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Kinnock also condemned South Africa's recent military raids into
Botswana and repeated a call for more Western military aid to
neighboring states.
   South Africa says its purpose in raiding Botswana is to strike
bases of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla movement
seeking to end white domination of South Africa.

<HEAD>Actor James Garner in Satisfactory Condition After Aneurysm
Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emmy-winning actor James Garner was
recovering from artery surgery on Wednesday, an operation postponed
three months ago after doctors decided he needed an immediate
quintuple heart bypass.
   ``He is doing quite well,'' said Ron Wise, spokesman for
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ``He is up, out of his bed, and
walking around in his room.''
   Garner, 60, entered Cedars-Sinai last Thursday. The surgery the
following day was to correct an aneurysm, or weakness, in the
aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the heart.
   The operation routinely requires a lengthy hospital stay, but
Garner has healed rapidly, Wise said.
   ``His recovery is remarkable. He is going to be released
probably by the end of the week, much earlier than previously
expected,'' said Wise.
   Garner also has recovered well from the five hours of heart
bypass surgery on April 21, Wise said.
   Garner starred in television's ``Maverick'' and ``The Rockford
Files,'' winning an Emmy for ``Rockford.'' He recently appeared
with Bruce Willis in the film ``Sunset,'' and received an Oscar
nomination for another of his movies, a role opposite Sally Field
in ``Murphy's Romance.''

<HEAD>Heavy Rain Gives Some Drought Relief to Tennessee, Mississippi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Locally heavy rain provided some drought relief to parts of the
Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys and gave a slight lift to the
Mississippi River on Wednesday.
   Minnesota also received some much needed rain, and thunderstorms
drenched parts of central and southern Florida.
   Most of the rest of the nation stayed dry, though, with early
afternoon temperatures in the 80s and 90s.
   Parts of Tennessee and northern Mississippi received several
inches of rain overnight, helping to narrow the area's severe
rainfall deficit.
   A flash flood warning was issued for parts of the northern
Mississippi counties of Marshall, Panola and Tate. Thunderstorms
deluged Senatobia, Miss., with up to 9 inches of rain Wednesday,
flooding local roads and washing out some bridges.
   In western Tennessee, Dyersburg received 4.7 inches of rain
Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, while Jackson recorded 3.4
inches and Memphis had 1.5 inches. The rain still left Memphis 8.5
inches below normal rainfall for the year so far, a shortfall
matched or exceeded by most other areas in the region.
   The rain boosted the much-depleted Mississippi River by
seven-tenths of a foot at Memphis, but the river remained 21 feet
below normal for this time of year, according to the Army Corps of
Engineers.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon over the
lower Ohio Valley, much of the Tennessee Valley and the southern
Appalachians, keeping temperatures in the 70s.
   Heavy rain also hit parts of central and east central Minnesota,
giving a boost to wilting crops but not ending the drought. A
farming area five miles north of Princeton recorded 3.9 inches of
rain.
   ``It's in the right direction,'' said Wayne Schoper, University
of Minnesota extension agent for Isanti County. ``It won't break
the drought but hopefully this is the start of something.''
   Showers and thunderstorms covered much of central and southern
Florida, with Key West recording nearly 2{ inches in the six hours
ended at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Warm, dry weather prevailed in most other parts, although
temperatures stayed in the 70s along the extreme northern parts of
the nation and in the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast and in
the Pacific Northwest.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 58 degrees at San Simeon
and Arcata, Calif., to 107 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz. The low
Wednesday morning was 36 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   Hot and humid weather was forecast for much of the nation
Thursday, with scattered showers and thunderstorms stretching from
the eastern Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast, from the
Ohio Valley to northern New England and over the eastern Tennessee
Valley.
   Highs are expected to be in the upper 60s and 70s along the
Pacific Coast and into the Pacific Northwest; in the 80s across the
northern part of the country from the northern Plateau and northern
Plains to the Great Lakes and New England; around 100 in the
central High Plains and the Rio Grande Valley; and between 105 and
115 across the desert Southwest. The rest of the nation should see
highs in the 90s.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
Wednesday that socialist leaders must share their experiences in
order to avoid making costly political errors as they overhaul
their economic systems.
   ``One must not panic because of single failures,'' Gorbachev
said in a pep talk for ``perestroika,'' his campaign to reform
Soviet economy and society. ``We have started such a great cause.
... He who is persevering will win.''
   The Soviet leader, midway through a six-day visit to Poland,
noted that the Polish government headed by Wojciech Jaruzelski is
embarked on a similar reform campaign known as ``socialist
renewal.''
   ``We find many useful things in your experiences also for
ourselves. We wish ... to display more ability, competence ... and
the ability to avoid errors, specifically political errors, at the
sharp turns of our history.''
   ``It is not one collective, city or province that pays for
political errors. Frequently it is the whole nation, country, that
pays for these errors,'' he told about 3,000 shipyard workers at a
rally in this port city.
   Poland's attempt to restructure its economy was dealt a setback
this year with the failure of a program that was aimed at
overhauling the retail price structure, trimming government
subsidies and bringing prices more in line with actual costs.
   The government raised prices an average of 40 percent, almost
immediately touching off inflation that hit 60 percent and is
expected to go higher.
   Polish leaders have admitted the reform effort was a failure and
needs a new approach.
   ``We are analyzing now the Polish experiences to find out what
elements we could use and to avoid your errors or the things you
consider erroneous,'' the Soviet foreign affairs spokesman, Gennady
Gerasimov, told a Polish reporter after Gorbachev's speech.
   Gorbachev told delegates to the Communist Party national
conference last month that a realistic price structure and
elimination of heavy government subsidies, particularly for many
foods, is vital if the Soviet Union is to eliminate shortages and
produce high-quality goods.
   He has given no indication how the program will be implemented.
   Gorbachev's speech was greeted with polite applause but little
outward enthusiasm by the workers, admitted by invitations they
received at their workplaces. Many came from enterprises elsewhere
in the city. Perhaps a third were among the shipyard's 8,300
employees.
   The shipyard was among the first major factories to go on strike
in August 1980 to support Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first and
only independent trade movement. The shipyard no longer plays a
leading role in the activities of Solidarity, now outlawed.
   Jaruzelski, the military general who came to power after the
labor unrest and imposed martial law, referred to Szczecin's
tumultous past.
   ``In this city eight years ago, the voice of protest rose
against distortions defying the essense of socialism,'' he said.
   But he added that ``everything creative and valuable'' from that
time is being preserved, while the socialist government seeks new
solutions to the nation's continuing economic problem.
   ``Those were stormy times,'' Jaruzelski said. ``It was bringing
along some solidarity and set working people at variance. There
were roads, but pathless tracts too. It has already become
history.''
   Meanwhile, a group of Solidarity members at a steel and defense
plant in southeastern Poland said their one-day strike won job
reinstatement Wednesday for seven fired activists. The seven had
been dismissed for leading a strike at the plant April 29-30.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban in Szczecin said there was an
attempt ``by a small group of people'' to start a strike at the
Stalowa Wola steel mill, but he said they failed.
   The plant 120 miles southeast of Warsaw is off-limits to
reporters, and there was no way to independently verify either
side's statements.
   Late Wednesday, one of the dismissed workers, Liwak Wladyslaw,
said in a telephone call to Warsaw that he and the other six were
promised in writing they would be rehired. He said the agreement
cme after six hours of talks with management.
   ``There was considerable pressure on us,'' Wladyslaw said. ``The
situation in Poland connected with Gorbachev's visit forced a
possibly quick solution here in Stalowa Wola.''
   Gorbachev returned to Warsaw later Wednesday.
   Gorbachev's visit highlighted the Szczecin shipyard's links to
the Soviet Union, which helped build the yard on territory captured
from Germany during World War II. The Soviet Union buys about half
the ships built at the yard. About 200 vessels built in the
Szczecin yard sail under the Soviet flag.
   The official shipyard workers' union presented Gorbachev and his
wife Raisa with a model of a cruise ship they lived aboard during
the 1986 U.S.-Soviet summit at Reykjavik, Iceland.

<HEAD>Preferred Stock Ownership Restrictions Lifted; May Help Ailing
S&Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. voted Wednesday to lift ownership restrictions on its
preferred stock, a move expected to bring a windfall of more than
$1 billion to the savings and loan industry.
   The corporation, known as Freddie Mac, is a congressionally
created corporation that buys home mortgages from savings
institutions and other lenders and packages them into securities
for resale to investors, thus making more money available for home
buyers.
   Freddie Mac voting stock is owned by the Federal Home Loan Bank
System, which, in turn, is owned by the nation's savings
institutions. Its preferred stock, with no voting power, is
currently owned directly by savings institutions.
   The Senate Banking Committee has been considering legislation,
sponsored by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., to allow S&Ls to sell
their preferred stock to public investors, thus creating a wider
market for the stock and driving its price up.
   Analysts estimate the move would bring a profit of between $1
billion and $1.5 billion to savings institutions, which are badly
in need of new capital. The industry posted a post-Depression
record loss of $7.6 billion last year and lost another $3.8 billion
in the first three months of this year.
   However, much of the preferred stock is owned by the healthier
segment of the industry and Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee, was pushing for a measure that,
through a transfer fee on sale of the stock, would have pumped
about $375 million of the windfall into the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., the ailing fund that insures S&L deposits up
to $100,000.
   However, Freddie Mac's board, which is the same as the
three-member Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the regulator of
federally insured S&Ls, pre-empted Congress by acting on its own to
remove ownership restrictions.
   The plan, approved by the board in principle, would lift
ownership restrictions on about 15 million shares of stock. Savings
institutions will be permitted until Nov. 30, on payment of a
$7-a-share fee to Freddie Mac, to exchange restricted shares for
shares which public investors will be permitted to buy after Jan.
1. Any preferred shares not exchanged by Nov. 30 will continue to
carry the ownership restrictions.
   That formula, if all the shares were exchanged, would bring
about $105 million to Freddie Mac, rather than the $375 million to
FSLIC as envisioned by Proxmire.
   Kenneth McLean, staff director of the Senate Banking Committee,
said Congress was unlikely to pass any legislation including
Proxmire's proposal because of stiff opposition from the industry
and the bank board.
   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largest
trade group, issued a statement late Wednesday hailing the board's
decision as ``a welcome and sensible move.''
   The Freddie Mac board also voted to lift the limits gradually on
the number of shares a single stockholder may own. The current
limit of 150,000 shares was raised to 300,000 immediately and will
rise to 450,000 effective Oct. 1 and 600,000 effective Jan. 1.
   Ownership restrictions on the 100,000 outstanding shares of
voting stock are unaffected by the plan and remain in place.
   Meanwhile, Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said a
new rule will take effect immediately requiring institutions with
less than the required level of capital to get approval of federal
regulators before selling their stock. The purpose is to allow
regulators to monitor stock sales by ailing institutions.

<HEAD>Central Committee Discusses Economic Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders discussed plans
for economic reform Wednesday in the Soviet bloc's first Central
Committee meeting to which a journalist was admitted.
   In a departure from the traditional secrecy of party
proceedings, a correspondent of state radio was allowed to attend
and gave hourly reports from the chamber in which the 108 Central
Committee members conferred.
   Committee Secretary Miklos Nemeth said the economy was in ``a
critical situation'' and further delays in implementing necessary
reforms would erode public confidence in the leadership.
   Nemeth said the economy and society should be open and
authorities should ``demolish the barriers that provide
overprotection for the economy.''
   He said all subsidies to money-losing enterprises should end,
and only those making profits should be granted ``possibilities for
development.''
   True commodity, money, capital and labor markets should be
established and companies freed from unnecessary restrictions,
enabling them to react ``as they see best,'' Nemeth declared.
   The radio broadcast 20 minutes of excerpts from Nemeth's speech
during a news program at noon.
   Past practice has been to give information on such meetings in
communiques, often vague, issued when they were over and rarely
indicating disagreement.
   On Wednesday, however, the radio said 20 Central Committee
members asked to speak after Nemeth's report on measures necessary
to curb the $18 billion debt and stimulate the stagnating economy.
   Premier Karoly Grosz, who also became party chief at the end of
May, has repeatedly sought public support of unpopular but
necessary austerity measures.
   He took over as party leader from Janos Kadar, who now has the
honorary post of party president. Official media said he was on
vacation and did not attend the meeting Wednesday.
   Grosz asked the public in a television interview Tuesday, to
``understand the need'' for reforms, which he said would require
``sacrifices for the sake of the future'' and might need 10-15
years to show results.
   Wednesday's broadcasts could help him soften any potential party
resistance to economic reform by taking debate on them direct to
the public.
   Nemeth said the reform program must be implemented as a package.
``Taking any one of the elements out of its context may inevitably
lead to confusion and failure,'' he said.
   He presented two alternative plans _ one of introducing radical
reforms that might bring social tension and higher unemployment,
and a second that would bring change more gradually. Hungary's
leaders have said the saecond course might mean lagging behind
competing nations.

<HEAD>Engineer: Why Texas Store Collapsed May Never Be Known</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials may never know why a Texas
department store collapsed, killing 14 people, but a preliminary
report will be available this week, an engineer investigating the
accident said Wednesday.
   ``I don't think we're going to be able to pinpoint a cause,''
Garry G. Nichols said. ``We're working on it now.''
   He said the investigation has been hampered by the
unavailability of important building records and sketchy witness
accounts.
   Nichols and Glenn J. Winslow, civil engineers with
Birmingham-based Southern Building Code Congress International
Inc., are the primary investigators of the collapse of the
three-story Amigo store in Brownsville. They spent three days there
after the July 7 accident.
   ``We've been told that the (city) building department has moved
two or three times ... and some of the records may have been
involved in a flood,'' Nichols said.
   He said the city is still searching its records, which were
stored in several locations, for the construction plans. Nichols
said one Brownsville building official said they may have been lost.
   Nichols said officials had not found the architect or engineer
of the building. The city contacted the contractor, but he had no
copy of the construction specifications.
   The store was built in 1969; the third floor was added about
1975, he said.
   Witnesses said lightning struck either an electrical transformer
or utility poles near the building, said Nichols. He said there is
speculation the poles might have fallen on the building, causing
the collapse.
   The engineers are also looking into the possibility that the
heavy rain falling that afternoon may have caused the cave-in. More
than 2 inches of rain fell in a 30-minute period just before the
collapse. Nichols said if the building's drainage pipes were
clogged, water could have backed up and its weight then could have
triggered the fall.
   Nichols and Winslow work for a non-profit agency that writes
building code laws for governments to adopt. Nearly 2,000 city,
county and state building departments are served by the
organization.
   A complete report on the Brownsville collapse will be issued in
several months.

<TEXT>
   National Football League Hall of Fame
member Bart Starr called for tougher drug laws Wednesday after
disclosing that his son died from cocaine use.
   Bret Starr, 24, was found dead last week in his Tampa, Fla.,
home. He was buried Monday in Montgomery, Ala.
   ``Drugs do kill,'' Starr said. ``He only had traces and yet the
traces killed him.''
   Hillsborough, Fla., sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa said the
medical examiner ruled Starr's son died of ``cardiac arrhythmia due
to acute cocaine indulgence. It's not necessarily an overdose.''
   Starr said stopping drug abuse is society's responsibility.
   ``All of us, one-on-one, at every level of society, should
pressure those who can change our laws to severely punish those who
deal and sell drugs because drugs are a killer,'' said the former
Green Bay Packers quarterback and coach.
   ``I'm vitally concerned that we're losing the war or have lost
the war on drugs,'' he said. ``I don't think people are aware of
the severity of the problem. It's worldwide, it's extremely severe
and it's growing.''
   Officials said Bret Starr died accidentally on July 4 or 5. His
body, unrecognizable because of decomposition, was found July 7
when his father went to the house.
   Starr, who quarterbacked the Green Bay Packers through the glory
years of the 1960s and later returned as coach, discussed his son's
battle with cocaine in his recent book: ``My Life in Football:
Starr.''

   Negotiators for Angola, Cuba and South
Africa agreed that Cuban troops will leave Angola and South Africa
will end its 73-year rule over Namibia, Assistant U.S. Secretary of
State Chester A. Crocker said Wednesday.
   The countries' military and political negotiators agreed on a
statement of principles that now must be approved by their
respective governments. Another meeting was scheduled for early
August.
   ``The Angolans, Cubans, and South Africans were able to reach
agreement on a set of principles which constitute the essential
elements of a political settlement in southwestern Africa,'' said
Crocker.
   The parties did not agree on a timetable for the Cuban
withdrawal at this week's private meetings, Crocker said during a
news conference at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.
   An estimated 50,000 Cuban troops back the Marxist Angolan
government in its fight against rebels supported by the United
States and South Africa. Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,
lies between Angola and South Africa and has been ruled by the
white-minority South African government since 1915.
   Crocker said that if the peace process ``catches fire,'' a
detailed settlement could be finalized in ``two or three more
rounds'' of talks.
   Private talks began Monday among the Americans, led by Crocker;
South Africans led by Neil van Heerden, that country's
director-general of foreign affairs; and a joint Angolan-Cuban
delegation.
   The talks took place under tight security at the U.S. Coast
Guard station on Governors Island in New York harbor, and concluded
Wednesday morning at the negotiators' hotel, across from the United
Nations building.
   Discussion of the mechanics of South Africa's withdrawal from
Namibia would begin at the August meeting. A venue has not yet been
set, but Americans close to the process said that Geneva and Rio de
Janiero had been suggested.
   Crocker said implementation of any ultimate settlement would
involve U.N. civil and military administrators moving into Namibia
to replace withdrawing South African troops, in compliance with
U.N. Resolution 435.
   Details of the set of principles, which Crocker said were ``a
couple of pages'' long, will not be released until the governments
have approved them.
   ``There are some large gaps that remain,'' Crocker added. ``For
example, the existing gap on the timing of the Cuban troop
withdrawal from Angola is a major issue. I think the parties agreed
that this was not the time to come to grips with that issue, and we
agree with that judgment.
   ``But they do recognize ... that there's going to have to be a
compromise, that there's going to have to be no losers, that it's
going to have to be something that can be verified to the
satisfaction of everybody,'' Crocker said.
   Earlier Wednesday afternoon, the head of the Angolan delegation
to the talks was asked if a final settlement was possible by
September, and he replied that the ``date is very close _ this is
the wish of everyone.''
   Lt. Gen. Antonio dos Santos Franca, who leads Angola's armed
forces and is known by his nom-de-guerre of Gen. N'Dalu, added:
``My government is waiting to discuss the withdrawal of the Cuban
troops.''
   South Africa had said it will accept a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for Namibia's independence under black majority
rule once the Cuban troops withdraw from Angola.
   Van Heerden had told reporters in the last two days that
negotiators were ``talking turkey'' and the peace process was ``on
track.''
   The four parties to the talks first met in London in early May
and then reconvened last month in Cairo, Egypt. South African and
Angolan officials held a separate meeting in May in Brazzaville,
the Congo.
   The U.S. goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, the
same time span the U.N. resolution sets for granting independence
to Namibia. Angola and Cuba have insisted the Cuban withdrawal
should take place over four years.
   The United States is a party to the talks because it has been
supporting the anti-communist rebel group UNITA, or National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, with money and weapons since
1985. A civil war has been under way in Angola since it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in 1915, during World
War I, and governed it under a mandate from the now defunct League
of Nations. The United Nations abrogated that mandate more than 20
years ago.
   In 1971, the World Court declared South Africa's continued rule
over Namibia illegal but the court, a branch of the United Nations,
has no enforcement power.
   
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from
Namibia into Angola to support the UNITA rebels against Cuban and
Angolan forces.
   Last fall, Cuba increased its troop strength in Angola from
35,000 to 50,000, U.S. officials have said, adding they believe the
build-up was intended to strengthen Havana's bargaining position in
the negotiations.

<HEAD>Sergeant At Arms Urges Beefing Up Security At Capitol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House was urged Wednesday to improve its
protection against terrorist attack by installing bomb detectors
and requiring use of computerized identity cards to gain access to
Capitol office buildings.
   An estimated $2,450,000 in interim security measures were
recommended by House Sergeant at Arms Jack Russ, who said that
``our system today can be defeated and we'd like to make it
tougher.''
   Russ told a House Administration subcommittee that installing 14
bomb detectors in the Capitol and at heavily used entrances to
House office buildings would help counter a major security threat
posed by plastic explosives.
   He said plastic explosives can pass undiscovered through the
current system of airport-style metal detectors used in the Capitol
and adjacent office buildings.
   Russ estimated that conversion to computerized access cards for
House members and employees entering office buildings from
underground parking garages would cost an initial $2 million. He
proposed an eventual extension of the pass system to all
congressional offices, at an additional cost of $10 million.
   The bomb detectors would cost an estimated $450,000 and could be
combined with existing metal detectors to screen one person every
six seconds, he said.
   The subcommittee told Russ to proceed immediately with another
plan to switch from special license plates to automobile bumper
stickers for House members and staff aides, but deferred action on
his other proposals.
   Rep. Joseph M. Gaydos, D-Pa., questioned the wisdom of making
piecemeal improvements to the Capitol's security system, and said
the House should hire a team of outside experts to do a
comprehensive study of security requirements.
   Russ responded that several such studies already had been
conducted, but that congressional leaders have rejected many
recommendations _ such as erecting a wrought iron fence around the
Capitol grounds _ in the interest of maintaining easy access by
visitors.
   ``This is not like the Kremlin,'' agreed Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., the panel chairman. ``The Capitol of the United States
and its offices represent a free, democratic society, and there are
those who believe we can't turn the Capitol into a fort.''
   Russ said most of his proposals Wednesday could be financed from
$13 million in unused funds previously appropriated by the House
for security precautions.
   Several subcommittee members expressed doubts about improving
security in the House without cooperation from the Senate. ``The
Senate side is like a different city,'' Russ replied. ``If we
waited for the Senate to catch up with us, we'd never get anything
done. They march to a different drummer than we do.''
   The proposals Russ advanced Wednesday are the first step toward
a more ambitious, $18.5 million security plan that House leaders
are still studying. That plan also includes an emergency telephone
system for alerting members immediately to any terrorist attack,
bomb-proof glass shields in the House visitors' gallery and
strengthening floor seats in the chamber to protect them against
bomb blasts.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call For Special VA Units To Treat Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Specialized medical teams should be placed in
every Veterans Administration hospital to treat former soldiers
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, three House
Democrats said Wednesday.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said he introduced legislation
requiring a specialized PTSD unit at all 172 Veterans
Administration hospitals nationwide because ``even highly trained
professionals may not recognize the illness.''
   ``It is unacceptable that a veteran is not able to go to the VA
hospital in his own state and be guaranteed adequate treatment for
an illness which is linked to military service,'' Gejdenson said.
   Gejdenson, along with Reps. Lane Evans, D-Ill., and Jim Jontz,
D-Ind., said the bill would require two teams consisting of
full-time psychologists or psychiatrists specially trained in
treating post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Similar teams exist at 15 VA hospitals, and there are 13
intensive care facilities available for the disorder.
   The measure would cost about $22 million a year to cover the
costs of added salaries.
   ``The cost of treatment is much less expensive than the cost of
the problem,'' Gejdenson said.
   The bill also would direct the Veterans Administration to set
standards for diagnosis and treatment of the illness and establish
criteria for training and education of counselors.
   Post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological illness tied
to veterans who were involved in battle. The Veterans
Administration has diagnosed 176,000 cases since 1980, and
Gejdenson said an estimated 100,000 may suffer from some symptoms
of the disorder. Most of the victims are from the Vietnam War era.
   ``We've waited all too long in not recognizing the damage that's
done, and the sooner we start the better our chances are of
success,'' Gejdenson said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
   ``Having gotten what you need from the veterans, do you now just
discard them?'' Gejdenson asked. ``They ought not to be forgotten.''
   The Connecticut congressman became involved in the PTSD issue
after a veteran looking for his estranged wife shot and seriously
injured her boss and then killed himself in February. The incident
occurred just one week after his release from a local VA center and
a day after he visited Gejdenson's local office.
   Initial police reports said the man suffered from the disorder.
He apparently did not, but Gejdenson remained interested in the
issue and developed the proposed legislation, according to aide
Chip Partner.

   A House committee voted unanimously Wednesday
to abandon an investigation of the administration of non-lethal
U.S. aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels after being told there were
few if any problems with it now.
   The investigation had been requested by Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., who headed a 1986 inquiry that determined that more than
half of an earlier $27 million package of aid for the Contras had
ended up in private hands.
   But Panetta told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the
Agency for International Development, which oversees the latest
$47.9 million Contra aid fund, is doing a good job overall in
administering the program.
   The previous economic aid to the Contras was administered by
other U.S. agencies.
   Panetta said AID voluntarily had provided all of the data he had
requested.
   ``It is clear from the documentation requested that AID has
implemented this entire program in a spirit of openness, allowing
for close public scrutiny and review,'' Panetta said before the
committee voted to drop the investigation.
   ``The agency should be commended for how it has handled the
administration of this program in the difficult political climate
surrounding the issue of humanitarian aid,'' Panetta said.
   He said the aid agency has established safeguards to make sure
assistance funds went to their intended recipients and that the
money was spent in accord with the law.
   He said the agency's operations also were monitored by the
General Accounting Office, along with AID's own inspector general
and the private accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.
   Panetta said he remains concerned, however, that Price
Waterhouse accountants were not able to document adequately a $1
million expenditure for so-called family assistance in which
monthly payments are made to senior Contra personnel living in
Costa Rica, Honduras and Miami.
   The payments range from $25 to $2,750 a month. with the payments
being made in Miami to 34 to 41 people, he said.
   He said none of the three monitoring agencies could document how
these payments were used.
   Price Waterhouse reported, Panetta said, that the recipients are
designated by Enrique Bermudez, commander of the Contra military
forces, who provides a list of beneficiaries and payment amounts,
including his own, with no formal criteria for designating or
removing beneficiaries.
   He also noted that Price Waterhouse found certain cases of
apparent abuse, including the sale of supplied food by Contra
members in Honduras to Hondurans and other Nicaraguan refugees.
   It is important that AID improve ways of verifying how family
assistance funds are used, Panetta said.
   The State Department recently had expressed concern that
Panetta's investigation appeared to challenge the integrity of the
administration of the Contra aid fund even after precautions had
been taken to assure that integrity.
   ``This inquiry has uncovered no significant accountability
problem with AID's administration of this assistance,'' Deputy
Secretary of State John C. Whitehead said in a letter to the
panel's chairman, Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.
   Panetta said $11.9 million of the aid fund has been spent to
date, including $6.7 million for food, clothing and medical care,
$385,000 on communications equipment, $1.5 million for a children's
surgical fund and $1.8 million for transportation.

   Iran asked the world's governing body for civil
aviation Wednesday to condemn the United States for downing an Iran
Air jetliner where 290 people died, saying it was a ``flagrant
violation'' of international law.
   The United States welcomed calls for the International Civil
Aviation Organization to investigate the July 3 tragedy over the
Persian Gulf. However, it said ``fair-minded'' countries should
conclude that the captain of the U.S. warship Vincennes acted
reasonably under the circumstances.
   U.S. officials said the missile cruiser Vincennes mistook Iran
Air Flight 655 for an Iranian F-14 jet fighter during combat with
four Iranian gunboats.
   The 159-member aviation organization is a United Nations agency.
Most of its 33-nation council, meeting in special session, favored
an investigation but refrained from condemning the United States.
The council was expected to reconvene Thursday.
   Soviet delegate Ivan Vasin repeated his country's condemnation
of the disaster, calling it ``a grievous international offense for
which the United States bears full responsibility.''
   The Czechoslovakian delegate said: ``My government strongly
condemns this tragic and unjustified act.''
   Many speakers urged ratification of a 1984 organization protocol
stating that weapons should never, under any circumstances, be used
against civilian aircraft. So far, 48 members have ratified it. To
take effect, it needs approval from 102 members.
   West Germany and other nations urged the body to review
provisions for coordinating military and civilian air traffic,
especially in war zones.
   After a minute of silence for the victims, the council heard
first from Iranian spokesman Hassan Shafty, who accused the United
States of evading responsibility by claiming it acted in
self-defense.
   ``The use of force against civil aircraft cannot be justified
under any circumstances and is a flagrant violation of
international law,'' Shafty said.
   The plane was ascending after taking off from Bandar Abbas,
Iran, on a 28-minute flight to Dubai and was transmitting normal
civilian airline signals, he said. His statement contradicted U.S.
claims that the plane was descending and sending both military and
civilian signals.
   Shafty accused the United States of hypocrisy since in past
cases it has categorically rejected the self-defense argument. His
comment was an apparent reference to the Soviet explanation for
shooting down a Korean Air Lines jet that strayed over Soviet
territory in 1983.
   In addition to an inquiry, Iran demanded that the aviation
organization call for an end to ``present obstacles, restrictions,
threats and use of force'' in Iranian air space and that of other
states bordering the Persian Gulf. It also urged condemnation of
the United States and recognition that it bears responsibility for
``the criminal actions'' of its officials.
   Outside the meeting chamber, Iranian official Seirous Naseri
acknowledged that Iran might fail to win a condemnation.
   But he said the U.N. Security Council, which was scheduled to
discuss the matter Thursday, may issue sterner language. ``That's
where politics comes into the scene,'' Naseri said.
   Iran belongs to the aviation body but not its council.
   Earlier, U.S. permanent representative Edmund Stohr told The
Associated Press that Iran would never get a condemnation because
the United States had many allies on the council.
   The U.S. delegation was led by Richard Williamson, assistant
secretary of state for International Organization Affairs.
   He said the payments that President Reagan has offered the
victims' families were voluntary, ``not on the basis of any legal
liability or obligation.''
   Williamson also said the United States would share with aviation
body the results of its own investigation, except for sensitive
military information.
   He blamed the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq for creating
the circumstances that led to the disaster.
   ``Some degree of responsibility must be taken by Iran for
putting its aircraft in this vulnerable position. The innocent
victims of Iran Air 655 are just the latest among the hundreds of
thousands of casualties in a needless war which should have ended
long ago.''
   He said the war has jeopardized the safety of naval and air
traffic in the gulf, and U.S. forces are deployed to contain the
threat.
   Williamson suggested restructuring civil air routes away from
dangerous areas and imposing new minimum altitudes. He also
recommended changes to aircraft transponders so that signals are
unambiguous and better radio communications to ensure all warnings
are received.

   CBS announced a management shakeup Wednesday
that has the president of CBS News becoming president of the
Broadcast Group and for the first time in CBS history brings in an
outsider to head the news division.
   Effective Aug. 1., ABC News Vice President David Burke takes
over CBS News, CBS News president Howard Stringer becomes president
of the CBS Broadcast Group, replacing Gene Jankowski, who becomes
Broadcast Group chairman.
   CBS' broadcast division has struggled during the past season,
with its entertainment schedule lagging in third place behind NBC
and ABC for the first time ever. The ``CBS Evening News'' has been
No. 1 among the three major networks' nightly news program in
recent weeks after trailing ABC during the second quarter of the
year.
   William S. Paley, chairman of the CBS board of directors, and
Laurence A. Tisch, the company's president and chief executive
officer, announced the changes in a statement.
   Tisch later opened a news conference on the changes by saying,
``Today, we start a new era.''
   Financial analysts suggested the changes were an inevitable
result of Tisch's efforts to place his stamp on the company, which
he has headed since the fall of 1986.
   ``Larry's putting his man in charge, and Gene is probably taking
the first step out the door,'' said Edward Atorino, who follows the
media business for the investment firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co.
   Stringer has been with CBS for 23 years, the last 22 months as
president of CBS News. Jankowski has served 11 years as president
of the CBS Broadcast Group.
   It was Stringer who steered the beleaguered news division
through the controversial and highly publicized layoffs and budget
cuts that prompted even CBS notables such as anchor Dan Rather to
criticize network management.
   Despite the cutbacks, the division under Stringer managed to
launch a new news show, ``48 Hours,'' and, with a little help from
the Writers Guild strike prompting the need for prime-time
programming not subject to its delays, kept three prime-time news
hours on the fall schedule, compared to one for ABC and none for
NBC.
   Phil Jones, general manager of KCTV in Kansas City, Mo., and
immediate past chairman of the CBS affiliates board, called
Stringer's appointment ``magnificent.''
   ``He is people-sensitive, programming-sensitive and has the
background in news that I think is the real foundation of CBS. He
will bring those qualities to the job and will be good person to do
business with,'' Jones said.
   Jankowski moved up through the CBS sales division to become head
of the Broadcast Group, overseeing the finances of the network.
During his tenure, CBS' prime-time schedule fell victim to NBC's
rise and last year embarrassed the network by placing a miserable
third. Kim LeMasters became a mid-season replacement for CBS
Entertainment President Bud Grant and will be tested when his first
full-season schedule finally gets on the air in 1988-89.
   Paley said Jankowski has been ``an outstanding president,'' and
said he was delighted Jankowski will continue ``as a key member of
CBS' senior management.''
   Tisch said Jankowski had told him that with the completion of
this year's program development cycle, it was ``an appropriate time
for an orderly transition in the management of the broadcast
group.''
   Stringer ``was the obvious candidate to assume leadership of the
broadcast group,'' Tisch said.
   Burke, who once served on the staff of U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy,
joined ABC 11 years ago as a business and policy adviser to ABC
News President Roone Arledge. Stringer said Burke has established
``a remarkable record as a news executive through program
innovation and management strength.''
   ``I am confident that CBS News under his leadership will
maintain the highest professional standards while finding creative
new ways to provide news programming and information to the
American people,'' Stringer said.
   Arledge, who successfully turned ABC News into a contender in
his decade there, is not expected to step down anytime soon. He
responded to Burke's impending departure by saying, ``He richly
deserves this recognition, which is a compliment both to him and to
ABC News. ... We all wish him the absolute best.''

<TEXT>
   Kabul radio said Wednesday that
security forces had killed 88 guerrillas in Afghanistan's eastern
provinces, but gave no figures on government casualties.
   It said 45 ``extremist elements,'' the Communist government's
term for Moslem insurgents, were killed in Wardak province and 43
during two operations in Nangarhar province near the border with
Pakistan.
   The radio did not say when the battles occurred or give the
sites in the provinces.
   Guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978,
and Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979.
More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country and at least 3
million live in cities and refugee camps just inside Pakistan.
   Soviet troops are withdrawing under a U.N.-mediated agreement
signed April 14 by Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the Soviet Union
and United States as guarantors.
   The pullout began May 15 and is to be completed by Feb. 15,
1989. More than 30,000 of the estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers
have left so far, according to U.N. figures.

   The PLO spokesman who called last month for
direct negotiations with Israel said Wednesday that two private
groups have invited him to the United States to discuss peace in
the Middle East.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, an adviser to Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat, said he was ``prepared to visit
Washington to elaborate further on my paper.'' He said the State
Department had not yet granted him a visa.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in Baghdad, Abu Sharif
said the invitations were from the Brookings Institution and the
National Press Club, both in Washington. The Brookings Institution
is a liberal think tank dealing with economic and foreign policy
issues.
   Abu Sharif, a writer and former journalist, published an article
last month in the London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror calling
for negotiations between the PLO and Israel in connection with a
U.N.-sponsored international peace conference.
   Arab radicals viewed the proposal as an implicit recognition of
Israel.
   Both Israel and the United States have refused to deal directly
with the PLO, but the Americans have said they would review the
position if the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist. The PLO
insists on simultaneous, mutual recognition.
   U.S. and Israeli officials have responded favorably to Abu
Sharif's article but demand that Arafat endorse it. Although the
PLO chief has made no public comment, it is unlikely Abu Sharif
would have published the article without his consent.
   Abu Sharif said Wednesday the PLO executive committee, the
organization's 15-man ruling body, discussed his paper last week
and approved it on the basis it did not contradict the condition of
mutual, simultanous recognition.
   He said the 11-man Central Committee that runs Fatah, the PLO's
largest guerrilla faction, also had no objections to the position.

   A court-martial jury found a
Navy petty officer guilty Wednesday of killing his ship's paymaster
and taking $94,000.
   A sentencing hearing was scheduled for Thursday to decide
whether Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben Colon, 34, should receive the
death penalty.
   No Navy man has been executed in this century.
   The five-member jury deliberated 10 hours before unanimously
finding Colon guilty of murder while perpetrating a robbery. The
panel also found him guilty of robbery and kidnapping.
   In closing arguments Tuesday, a prosecutor said Colon strangled
the paymaster, shot him in the head, buried him in a ``pile of
seabags'' and then emptied the safe.
   To allow consideration of the death penalty, the murder verdict
had to be unanimous and the jury had to find that a robbery was
committed or that the murder was premeditated. Colon was found
innocent of murder with premeditation.
   At the sentencing hearing, attorneys will have an opportunity to
present evidence and arguments.
   Colon, an electronic warfare technician from Vega Baja, Puerto
Rico, was convicted of killing Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad, 24, of Park
Forest, Ill., while the destroyer John Hancock was docked at
Mayport Naval Station on March 15.
   Investigators searched three of Colon's safe-deposit boxes and
found $87,350 in cash and 2,575 blank U.S. Treasury checks, each
bearing the USS John Hancock imprint, a prosecutor said.
   Defense attorney Lt. Matthew Michels argued that other crew
members had been under suspicion for the crime, owned weapons and
failed polygraph examinations.

<TEXT>
   The second Howard Beach racial assault trial
headed toward completion Wednesday with one jury deliberating an
attempted murder charge, and another jury considering riot charges
against four people.
   One jury completed its second day of deliberations without
deciding the fate of Thomas Gucciardo, 19, who is charged with
attempted murder, assault and riot stemming from the Dec. 20, 1986,
attack by a white gang on three blacks in the predominantly white
Queens neighborhood.
   The second jury recessed for the evening at 7:25 p.m., eight
hours after the trial judge, state Supreme Court Justice Thomas
Demakos, gave the panel instructions concerning the four
co-defendants, all facing riot charges.
   Gucciardo and the others _ William Bollander, Thomas Farino and
James Povinelli, all 18, and John Saggese, 20 _ were tried together
but the second jury heard no testimony about the more serious
charges against Gucciardo.
   The trial, which began June 13, was the second stemming from the
highly publicized racial assault. Three teen-agers were convicted
of manslaughter in the first trial for the death of Michael
Griffith, 23, who was struck by a car and killed as he fled his
attackers.
   A fourth youth was acquitted at that trial; two other teen-agers
pleaded guilty to riot charges just prior to the second trial.
Another defendant, Robert Riley, agreed to plead guilty and
testified against the others at both trials.

<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Board of Education voted
Wednesday to require emergency exit windows on new school buses,
the first design changes ordered since a fiery bus crash killed 27
people in May.
   The board also voted to require new buses to be powered by
diesel fuel, which is considered safer and less combustible than
gasoline. Officials said that change had been proposed as an
economy measure before the May 14 crash of the bus owned by the
Radcliff First Assembly of God church, which was gas-powered.
   In addition to the changes, the board ordered studies of other
safety devices, including roof exits, additional side doors, extra
fire extinguishers and fire-retardant seat covers.
   The decisions followed the recommendations of a standing
advisory committee that annually reviews the state's bus safety
standards.
   Sam Jackson, the state education department's representative on
the advisory committee, stressed that better training of drivers
and evacuation training for school children may do more than the
design measures.
   ``Push-out windows or any emergency exit are not worth a darn
unless you develop some plan of evacuation,'' Jackson said.
   But he added, ``We definitely feel push-out windows will not
hurt.''
   About two-thirds of Kentucky's school buses are gas-powered,
said Byron Watkins, a committee member and assistant superintendent
of Hopkins County schools.
   The state board also recommended that local districts:
   _Restrict seating to two children per bench seat on buses making
extracurricular trips and use separate vehicles to transport cargo,
such as band instruments and sports equipment. Children were
sitting three abreast on the Radcliff bus, a capacity for which the
bus was built.
   _Step up bus-driver training programs in defensive driving, bus
cleanliness, evacuation and use of emergency equipment.
   The Radcliff church's 1977 model bus exploded in flames when it
was struck head-on by a pickup truck driven in the wrong direction
on Interstate 71 near Carrollton.
   The victims, who included 24 children, were returning from an
outing at the Kings Island amusement park near Cincinnati. The
state medical examiner said all died of smoke inhalation, not from
crash injuries.
   Like school buses commonly in use in Kentucky, the church bus
had a single emergency exit at the rear. Safety officials have said
that was insufficient to evacuate a large numbers of passengers.
   Under the new rule, the largest school buses _ those built for
65 to 71 passengers _ must have two window exits on each side.
Buses built for 35 to 53 passengers must have one window exit on
each side.
   Buses equipped for the handicapped would need one window exit on
35-passenger models and two window exits on 65-passenger models.
   No additional exits would be required on any bus carrying 21 or
fewer passengers.
   The board also recommended, but did not require, that school
systems install exit windows on existing buses that are used for
trips outside local school districts.
   Kentucky has about 7,500 school buses, of which 1,047 were built
before 1978, when stricter federal safety standards went into
effect, said Jackson. Those federal standards require a steel cage
around the fuel tank _ a feature the Radcliff bus lacked.

   The Senate, in an overwhelming 91-4 vote,
condemned Nicaragua's Sandinista government Wednesday for
``dramatic new steps in brutality'' and warned that further human
rights violations could trigger renewed U.S. military aid to the
Contra rebels.
   In what some senators called a ``carrot and stick policy,'' the
Senate also said it was ready to extend economic aid to Nicaragua
if the Sandinistas fully comply with commitments made a year ago
and ``proceed to permit the establishment of a democratic system.''
   Although the sense of the Senate resolution is not binding, the
wide bipartisan coalition which swung behind it was intended to
emphasize the anger and concern caused by recent Sandinista actions
to suppress dissent.
   These include the closing of the opposition newspaper La Prensa
and Nicaragua's Catholic radio station, the suppression of a
non-violent demonstration in Managua, the arrest of 40 opposition
political leaders and the expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats.
   ``You can say its only a sense of the Senate resolution, but in
my view it means a great deal,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   Dole told the Senate: ``We are moving now because the Sandinista
goons have been in the streets of Managua again; because the
Sandinista jails are filling up with new prisoners; because what
little independent media there has ever been in Nicaragua is being
closed down again; and because the light of freedom in Nicaragua
has been nearly snuffed out again.''
   The resolution states: ``The Sandinistas should understand that
blatant violations (of last year's peace agreement) and the human
rights of the Nicaraguan people could cause Congress to consider
the provision of additional humanitarian and other appropriate
assistance, including military aid, if conditions should so
warrant.''
   Originally drafted by Dole but modified by Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the resolution also
supported President Reagan's action in expelling Nicaraguan
diplomats from the United States as ``an appropriate response to
the unjustified expulsion of U.S. diplomats from Managua.''
   ``Now, for the first time, we have a broad-based bipartisan
policy toward Nicaragua,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M. ``For
the first time, the United States Senate is blaming only the
Sandinista communists for what is going on there.
   ``We're saying, loud and clear, Daniel Ortega, you and your
regime are violating the peace plan, violating the human rights of
your people,'' he said.
   The four senators voting against the resolution were Sens. Brock
Adams, D-Wash.; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii,
and William Proxmire, D-Wis. Those not voting were Sens. Joseph R.
Biden, D-Del.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; John
Stennis, D-Miss., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee questioned
Ambassador Richard Melton privately and members said later they
found no evidence he was in engaged in espionage or any other acts
that would justify his expulsion or that of seven other U.S.
diplomats.
   And 37 Republican senators appealed to House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, to permit House members to vote on legislation which would
not only condemn the Sandinista regime but would continue economic
aid to the Contras and keep open the option of resuming military
aid ``if Sandinista repression continues.''
   ``We hope that this new and blatant proof of Sandinista tyranny,
violations of human rights and bad faith will lead you to support
our legislation or, at a minimum, permit the members of the House
of Representatives the opportunity to make their own judgment on
its merits,'' the senators said in their letter to Wright.
   While not responding directly, Wright told reporters that a
bipartisan group of House members was drafting an alternative
resolution which will ``call upon the Nicaraguan government to
reopen the organs of free expression and repeal the law that
permits the response they made.''
   Dole told his colleagues that the Central American peace process
has broken down and that the Sandinistas, freed of the pressure
represented by Contra military action, have no incentive to live up
to their commitments to embrace democratic reforms.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a leader of efforts to cut off
Contra aid, told reporters he continues to believe the United
States should use diplomatic rather than military pressure to bring
democratic change in Nicaragua.
   Cranston said the Sandinistas' recent action makes him no more
sympathetic than before to the Contra cause.
   ``But it doesn't make me any more sympathetic to the Sandinistas
either,'' he said.
   Melton answered questions before a private session of the
Intelligence Committee, but objections by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd,
D-Conn., blocked the committee from continuing the session in
public.
   Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., said he will try to
question Melton in public on Thursday.

<HEAD>New Nuclear Arsenal ``At Risk'' Over Warhead Plant Delay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delayed construction of a warhead parts factory
for U.S. Trident nuclear missiles threatens to slow modernization
of Britain's nuclear arsenal, a parliamentary committee said
Wednesday.
   ``We believe that warhead production is a major risk area to the
Trident program,'' the House of Commons' influential Public
Accounts Committee said in a report.
   The committee, headed by a legislator in the governing
Conservative Party, Robert Sheldon, accused the Defense Ministry of
inadequate management and control of the building program, adding,
``We are dismayed and concerned.''
   The potent Trident missiles may not be in service on schedule
because of a delay in construction work on a facility to make
warhead components in Berkshire, west of London, the committee said.
   Completion of the facility has fallen four years behind
schedule. The buildings at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at
Aldermaston, 50 miles from London, will not be ready until 1992 and
deployment of the missiles was planned for the mid-1990s.
   Under a $15 billion program, 16 Trident missiles and four
Trident submarines are to replace the same numbers of Polaris
missiles and subs, which date from 1969.
   The long-range Trident missiles are to increase British nuclear
firepower eightfold.
   The committee said the delay meant vital work on Trident
components will have to be done on old premises used to build
warheads for Britain's aging fleet of submarine-launched Polaris
missiles.
   Defense Ministry officials testified to the committee that they
still expect the billion Trident system to come into service on
schedule. They argued there was a better chance of keeping on
schedule by using the old facilities, provided they did not break
down, than simply not doing the work.
   ``However, there is clearly some risk of breakdown and we are
concerned at the extent of reliance on the use of aging facilities
which need to be replaced,'' said the report.
   The $1.7 billion new building, known as A90, at Aldermaston was
too complex for the Atomic Weapons Facility to handle and private
consultants had to be called in, the report said.
   Plutonium and uranium components for the warheads are to be
assembled at Aldermaston, while the rest will be U.S.-made. The
submarines are being built in Britain.
   In January a London newspaper, The Independent, reported that
warhead shortages threatened the Trident program. The Defense
Ministry at first denied this, but later acknowleged ``slippages''
in the program.
   The Independent reported that mistakes in building the
Aldermaston facility meant having to tear out piping, wiring and
fittings from buidlings designed before it was known what equipment
they were to house.
   The newspaper said that extending the life of the Polaris
weapons if Trident is not ready will cost about $425 million for
each of the four submarines.
   The Polaris submarines carry fewer warheads and are more
vulnerable to Soviet attack than the new Trident system.

   A man suspected of being an East
German spy was arrested after crossing from East Germany into
Bavaria posing as a hiker, officials said Wednesday.
   The unidentified 29-year-old man carried a false passport
bearing the name of a living West German man, said Bavarian state
police.
   After interrogation by police, the suspect admitted he was a
citizen of East Germany, officials said.
   The man was arrested June 16 near the East German border at
Maroldsweisach, in northern Bavaria, officials said.
   The arrest was not immediately announced so the investigation
would not be jeopardized, police said.
   Police did not say what kind of espionage the East German was
allegedly assigned to undertake in West Germany.

   A jury was selected Wednesday in the
trial of a Lutheran minister and a journalist accused of smuggling
two pregnant Salvadoran women into the United States, and attorneys
began arguing over what evidence should be admitted.
   The defense asked U.S. District Judge John Conway to bar
statements allegedly made by a Salvadoran attorney, Luis Arturo
Ventura-Rivas, who was indicted Dec. 10 along with the Rev. Glen
Remer-Thamert and free-lance journalist Demetria Martinez.
   Ventura-Rivas remains in El Salvador and is not currently on
trial.
   Conway delayed ruling on the motion to exclude evidence, saying
he wanted to study the matter. He told attorneys to be ready with
opening statements Thursday morning.
   Remer-Thamert, 44, was indicted on nine counts of conspiracy,
transporting and harboring illegal aliens and mail fraud, the
latter charge in connection with the adoption of one of the
Salvadoran women's babies. Ms. Martinez, 28, was charged with four
counts of transporting and inducing illegal aliens.
   Conway said he was concerned about admitting into evidence a
letter allegedly written by Ventura-Rivas in November 1986 and
delivered by Remer-Thamert to one of the Salvadoran women in
Albuquerque. Conway noted the indictment charges the defendants
with a conspiracy that ended Aug. 28, 1986, but the letter was
written months later.
   He also said he had problems extending any alleged conspiracy
between Remer-Thamert and Ventura-Rivas to include Ms. Martinez.
   U.S. Attorney William Lutz argued that statements from
Ventura-Rivas should be allowed because they could be corroborated
with other evidence. But defense attorney Karen Snell of San
Francisco called that evidence hearsay.
   The only person to testify at the three-hour hearing was Mike
Murphy, a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service investigator,
who described what the Salvadoran women told him about their trip
into the United States in August 1986.
   The women, Cecelia Elias-Alegria and Inez Campos-Anzora, were
not in court Wednesday, although they remain in the United States
and are expected to be called as prosecution witnesses.

   Retired FBI agent J. Gordon Shanklin, who directed
the federal investigation of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, has died of cancer. He was 78.
   Shanklin, who died Monday, was named agent in charge of the
Dallas division of the FBI in 1963, a few months before the
assassination.
   Shanklin was called ``No Comment Shanklin'' by reporters and
never spoke publicly about the FBI's investigation.
   Shanklin retired in June 1975 after 32 years with the FBI to
practice law in Dallas.
   Born and reared in Elkton, Ky., Shanklin earned bachelor's and
law degrees from Vanderbilt University.
   Shanklin practiced law in Nashville, Tenn., from 1934 to 1943,
when he joined the FBI. In addition to Dallas, he worked in FBI
offices in Huntington, W.Va.; New York; Washington, D.C.; Mobile,
Ala.; Pittsburgh; Honolulu; and El Paso.

   An 11-year-old California boy bidding
to fly the Atlantic in a single-engine plane arrived in this
western Scottish port city Wednesday night from Iceland.
   Christopher Lee Marshall said he plans to leave for Paris
Thursday morning to complete his journey and become the youngest
pilot to cross the Atlantic.
   The boy, from Oceano, Calif., started his flight in San Diego,
Calif., July 7. He said he hoped to reach Le Bourget airport
outside Paris at 11 a.m. (5 a.m. EDT). Le Bourget is where Charles
Lindbergh completed his historic solo crossing in 1927.
   Christopher and Randy Cunningham, a 46-year-old retired U.S.
Navy pilot who is accompanying the boy, don't regard the feat
accomplished until they reach Paris, following Lindbergh's
tradition. The two stayed overnight at a Glasgow hotel.
   Earlier Wednesday, Christopher landed his Mooney 252 aircraft at
Reykjavik, Iceland's capital, after flying about 450 miles from
Kulusuk on Greenland's southeast coast in 2 hours, 15 minutes.
   On arrival at Reykjavik, Christopher said the flight was
pleasant but he was frightened Tuesday over Greenland when he was
forced to return to Kulusuk because of problems with low oil
pressure and an overheated engine.
   He said he flew the plane all the time but needed Cunningham's
expert skills and knowledge to advise him on landing in Greenland.
   Asked why he was doing it, the boy said: ``I want to get kids
all over the world to accomplish their dreams.''
   Christopher has his teddy bear in the plane's back seat.
   ``He (the bear) doesn't like to sit in the back but I throw him
farther back if he starts complaining,'' he said.
   Cunningham limits Christopher's daily flying time to eight
hours. He stopped in St. Louis, New York and Montreal before flying
to Greenland.
   Last year Christopher became the youngest pilot to cross the
United States, a record that has since been broken by 9-year-old
Tony Aliengena.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will try to
persuade China's leaders to stop selling missiles in the Middle
East because they are destabilizing the region, a senior State
Department source said Wednesday.
   The Chinese already have sold CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles
to Saudi Arabia and may be marketing another missile in the Middle
East still being tested in China, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The ballistic missiles ... are being introduced into one of
the most volatile areas of the world,'' the source said. ``They
have introduced a new weapons system that had not been in the
Middle East before.''
   The source said Shultz would try to convince the Chinese
leadership the weapons flow is destabilizing the Middle East, a
process neither in China's interest nor that of the United States.
   Shultz left for Beijing on Thursday for a visit that includes
meetings with senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen.
   It will be the sixth stop on a nine-nation Asian and Pacific
tour.
   Shultz arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday for a one-day stopover
before proceeding to China, South Korea, Japan and the Marshall
Islands. He has already visited Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and
the Philippines.
   Recent news reports have quoted Israeli officials as saying the
Chinese may be selling M-9 missiles to Syria. The State Department
source said the Chinese have denied the reports and have said the
CSS-2s sold to Saudi Arabia were non-nuclear and defensive in
nature.
   The United States believes the M-9, with an estimated range of
375 miles, is still being tested but that marketing may have begun,
the source said.
   ``China has not been a major player in the Middle East but its
emergence as a major arms suppliers in the area has changed that,''
the source said. ``So the question of how our interests interplay
in the Middle East has become more significant over the last year
and a half.''
   In Hong Kong, Shultz discussed the problem of the Vietnamese
refugee flow with the colony's governor, Sir David Wilson.
   The governor told Shultz Hong Kong was enforcing a month-old
policy of deterring the Vietnamese from leaving their homeland and
hoped to establish a repatriation program with Vietnam, a senior
U.S. administration source said.
   A political adviser to the governor is to leave for Hanoi next
week for talks with the Vietnamese on the refugee problem, which
escalated this year.
   About 20,000 refugees are in Hong Kong, including more than
3,000 who arrived since the new policy was announced.
   Hong Kong continues to grant temporary asylum but prohibits
people from seeking resettlement in third countries if they fled
their homeland for economic reasons rather to avoid political
persecution.
   The more than 90 percent of those who are regarded as economic
refugees are housed in camps and told they will eventually be sent
back to Vietnam.
   The State Department official said that in Beijing Shultz will
also discuss recent U.S.-Soviet developments, the future of
war-torn Cambodia and security at the Olympic Games in Seoul, South
Korea, which begin Sept. 17.
   The source said China has recently proposed a new peace plan for
Cambodia. China supports the Khmer Rouge and other guerrilla groups
fighting the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in 1978.
   The United States and most countries are opposed to a return to
power by the Khmer Rouge, who massacred hundreds of thousands of
their countrymen in an agrarian revolution. Washington maintains
Bejing has recently become more flexible on this issue.
   The Chinese plan includes provisions for freezing military
forces of all sides and the nomination of leaders by the various
Cambodian factions that would be acceptable to all parties.

<TEXT>
   The City Council Wednesday unanimously approved a
resolution condemning CBS for favorably depicting drug use by
broadcasting a Mighty Mouse cartoon in which the caped superhero
sniffs a light-colored substance.
   ``What else do people snort up their noses but cocaine,'' said
council member Charles Tandy, an anethesiologist. ``I know of only
one other thing, and that's a type of medicine for asthma, but I
don't think this was that.''
   Tandy, who introduced the resolution, said his attention was
drawn to the cartoon while he was attending a medical convention in
Chicago three weeks ago.
   CBS officials previously have denied that the cartoon character
was shown using drugs in an April 23 episode of ``Mighty Mouse: The
New Adventure.''
   A woman answering the phone at CBS in New York said late
Wednesday afternoon that no one was available to comment on the
Dallas council's resolution.
   The resolution, which will be forwarded to CBS and the Federal
Communications Commission, urged that CBS immediately begin running
anti-drug public service announcements aimed at children.
   Tandy showed council members reproductions of cartoon cells in
which Mighty Mouse sits around a campfire listening to friends'
stories, then produces a powdery substance from inside his cape and
snorts it.
   Officials of the American Family Association first accused
Mighty Mouse of overt drug use last month.
   CBS responded with a letter to the group saying the character
was enjoying a pink mass of crushed stems, tomatoes and flowers
that a former girlfriend had given him. The network said there was
``no change of mood or behavior' after the flowers reached his nose.
   Tandy said he hopes to hear CBS' response to the council's
resolution.
   ``In my opinion, the No. 1 problem that faces Dallas, and this
country, is the drug problem,'' Tandy said. ``The only thing that
I'm trying to do is raise people's consciousness to this problem.''

   The U.S. Embassy temporarily stopped
issuing tourist visas to Nicaraguans, a spokeswoman announced
Wednesday, after the two countries ordered several of each other's
diplomats expelled.
   Also Wednesday, the leftist Sandinista government expropriated
Nicaragua's largest sugar and rum production company, according to
official Radio Sandino.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Jan Hartman said the embassy was forced
to stop issuing the tourist visas because it lacked personnel after
Nicaragua expelled eight diplomats. ``We just don't have enough
bodies,'' she said.
   Ms. Hartman did not say when the embassy would begin processing
the visas again.
   The government on Monday ordered U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton
and seven other diplomats to leave. The Sandinistas accused the
American diplomats of encouraging domestic dissent and unspecified
``criminal acts'' against the Nicaraguan people.
   Melton left Tuesday for Washington, and the others were due to
leave by Thursday.
   Washington retaliated by ordering out Nicaragua's ambassador and
seven other diplomats.
   Ms. Hartman said the embassy's consular section will continue
handling problems involving Americans.
   She said the embassy in recent months has handled 250 requests
for tourist visas daily.
   A leading businessman, meanwhile, attacked the government's move
to take over Ingenio San Antonio, Nicaragua's oldest and largest
sugar mill. Gilberto Cuadro, vice president of the opposition
Superior Council of Private Enterprise, called the expropriation
``the end of a mixed economy in Nicaragua.''
   President Daniel Ortega announced in June steps to move the
government away from Marxist wage and price control in order to
surmount the economic damages caused by seven years of war against
the U.S.-supported rebels known as Contras.
   Ortega said last month that the government did not plan to
abolish private enterprise ``because there would be political
pluralistic demonstrations against the revolution.''
   Radio Sandino said Wednesday the government expropriated the
mill because the wealthy Pellas family that owned it ``had not been
investing money in it since 1981.''
   The mill and accompanying enterprises, including the rum
distillery Flor de Cana, are near Chichigalpa, a city 79 miles west
of the capital.
   Since the Sandinistas seized power in July 1979, overthrowing
the rightist pro-American regime of President Anastasio Somoza,
they have taken over many privately owned companies.
   The radio said the government will appoint a special commission
to compensate the mill owners.

   An indignant Jesse Jackson hinted broadly
Wednesday at a possible convention fight in Atlanta next week,
saying the floor was ``wide open'' when the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket is decided.
   Jackson, rebuffed in his bid for the spot that likely Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis gave to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, returned to
Chicago to plan his convention strategy and to prepare for the bus
caravan that will take him and his supporters to Atlanta.
   Aides said he was ``flabbergasted'' at the way the announcement
of Bentsen was handled. Jackson heard from reporters Tuesday that
he had not been chosen, although Dukakis said at a news conference
Wednesday that he had tried unsuccessfully to reached Jackson
before the news got out.
   Two Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Jackson was told privately Monday afternoon that he would not be
picked. One source said Dukakis emissary Paul Brountas told Jackson
``he would bring the ticket down'' if nominated for vice president.
   ``After yesterday, many people have a sense of indignation and a
sense of insult,'' Jackson said at a news conference.
   As to whether that feeling would result in a bitter fight in
Atlanta next Thursday when the vice presidential nomination is
taken up, Jackson took a wait-and-see approach and stopped short of
saying he would engineer a dispute.
   He confirmed that his supporters planned to put his name in
nomination for the presidential spot on the ticket, but would not
say whether they would do so for the vice presidential spot as well.
   ``At this point I'm not in the partnership,'' he said, adding:
``I'm not suggesting that I will compete for a place on the ticket
but the floor is wide open on Thursday night when the
recommendation is made.''
   Jackson said that ``so long as we stay within the rules and
follow the process'' the possibility of such a fight was there.
   Dukakis, told of Jackson's hint of a fight over the vice
presidential nomination, said: ``I'm confident we'll have a united
convention.''
   Later, addressing Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he
founded, Jackson criticized ``power brokers (who) have sat in small
rooms with closed doors and made great decisions.''
   ``We must be a part of this process. When they sit around these
tables, the key investors in our party are not in the group,'' he
said.
   At his news conference, Jackson said he spoke briefly with
Bentsen earlier Wednesday, describing the conversation as a
``courtesy call that I appreciated very much.''
   But he said that the choice of Bentsen was a blow to the
progressive Democrats who had helped bring the party ``back to
life.''
   ``The conservative wing is now in the equation. They have
someone recommended for the ticket, subject to ratification ... at
the convention,'' Jackson said at a news conference.
   He said his supporters have ``earned a place in the Democratic
equation'' but ``so far no talks have taken place along that line.''
   Jackson said he would leave Thursday on the ``Rainbow Express''
bus caravan that will stop in Indianapolis, Ind.; Louisville, Ky.;
Nashville, Tenn., and Chattanooga, Tenn.; on the way to Atlanta.
   At each stop, he will be registering people to vote and raising
money for a political action committee, ``Keep Hope Alive.'
   ``Our objective is simply this _ to achieve within our party a
partnership. To be a part of the equation. To share responsibility.
... We're the future of the party,'' said Jackson.
   Jackson said he was not given the nod by Dukakis yet he will be
asked to deliver votes.
   ``In reality, I'm being asked to, in spite of inadequate
communication and not being recommended for the ticket, to motivate
more people and deliver more votes and pour out more energy at
greater risk and danger than any governor or any senator.
   ``So with that responsibility, and with those obligations must
go the ability to satisfy the legitimate and reasonable requests of
those constituents. ... Those who do in fact invest in a Democratic
Party victory must get a fair return on their investment.''

<HEAD>Official Says Panama Interfering With Smooth Operation of Canal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Panama Canal Commission
said Wednesday that Panama's boycott of a meeting here interferes
with the waterway's operation and threatens a smooth transition to
Panamanian ownership.
   Board Chairman William Gianelli said the Panamanian government
ordered its four members of the nine-member board not to attend the
meeting because of U.S. sanctions against Panamanian leader Gen.
Manuel Noriega. He added that Noriega, who has been indicted on
drug-related charges in Florida, also was upset when the canal
board canceled a meeting to be held in Panama in April.
   Panamanian officials say they will continue to boycott the
meetings until ``the United States normalizes relations with
Panama, whatever that means,'' Gianelli said.
   The Reagan administration, which appointed the Panama Canal
Commission's five U.S. board members, is seeking Noriega's ouster
and supporting a president whom the general removed in February.
   The board, meeting privately without its Panamanian members,
voted to suspend its regulations calling for at least two of its
four annual meetings to be held in Panama, spokesman Michael Rhode
said.
   Panama has said it will not recognize any action taken by the
canal board members here.
   Gianelli said Panama is interfering with the operation of the
canal, through which about 12,000 ships pass each year, by not
allowing administrative staff members to attend meetings.
   The commission is supposed to manage the canal until Dec. 31,
1999, when Panama is to assume full responsibility under a treaty
between the two countries.
   Gianelli said tension between the United States and Panama is
not yet affecting the operation of the canal, but could do so.
   ``We are still moving ships through the canal, but it is hurting
morale for the 8,500 employees of the commission,'' Gianelli said.
``The situation is not the healthiest thing.''

   The Army Corps of Engineers Wednesday began
shipping fresh water from New Orleans to Plaquemines Parish at the
southern tip of the Mississippi Delta, where river water has become
too salty to drink.
   Salty Gulf of Mexico water has been creeping up the Mississippi
for weeks because the drought has reduced the river's southern flow
drastically.
   The Corps is drawing fresh water from the river at New Orleans
and shipping it on barges to Pointe a la Hache and other
Plaquemines communities. Corps spokesman Bruce Sossaman said the
first barges should reach Pointe a la Hache by early Thursday
morning.
   ``We anticipate delivering about 3{ million gallons of water a
day,'' said Don Clement, acting director of operations for the
Corps' New Orleans District.
   ``If the salt water wedge migrates up, we'll provide the same
type of a service to the other parishes as their salt content
increases,'' Clement told a gathering of state and local officials
here.
   The Corps also is constructing an underwater sill near Myrtle
Grove in Plaquemines Parish to impede the flow of salt water
upriver. The salt water is heavier than fresh water and creeps
along the river bottom.
   At the Plaquemines Parish intakes, salt concentrations have been
reported at more than 1,500 parts per million.
   Health officials say salt cannot be tasted in concentrations
below 400 or 500 parts per million and doesn't pose a health threat
until it reaches 1,000 parts per million or more.
   Heavy rain in western Tennessee lifted the shrunken Mississippi
seven-tenths of a foot higher than expected at Memphis, Tenn.,
according to James Pendergrass, a hydrologist with the Army Corps
of Engineers.
   Nevertheless, the Mississippi was still 21 feet below normal for
this time of year and the Coast Guard said the slight rise had no
effect on the river's commercial traffic.
   There were these other drought-related developments:
   _State regulators in Des Moines, Iowa, filed formal charges of
misrepresentation Wednesday against Federal Insurance Co. for
selling drought insurance policies to 1,500 Iowa farmers and then
failing to issue the policies.
   Insurance Commissioner William Hager said he would try to force
Federal, a subsidiary of the Chubb Group Insurance Cos. of Warren,
N.J., to issue the policies or give farmers a double refund on
premiums paid.
   Chubb officials said one of Federal's agents had violated his
authority in selling thousands more policies than the company had
approved, and that they would offer double refunds to farmers at a
cost of $15 million to $20 million.
   _Ohio Lt. Gov. Paul Leonard asked three state agencies to draft
proposals to combat the drought's impact and said the Legislature
might need to convene in a special session.
   ``There isn't sufficient legislation on the books to address the
drought,'' he said, adding that the state currently doesn't have
authority to intervene in local water allocation disputes.
   _Illinois Treasurer Jerry Cosentino unveiled a program of loans
for farmers at below-market interest rates.
   Cosentino said the state would provide $50 million to banks to
lend to farmers under the program and said he was prepared to add
another $150 million if necessary.
   _In Tampa, Fla., the Southwest Florida Water Management District
called for voluntary but immediate water-use cutbacks throughout a
16-county area on Florida's Gulf coast. The agency asked water
users to irrigate only before 9 a.m. and after 5 p.m., when
evaporation is reduced; to use irrigation equipment that conserves
water when possible, and to run only full loads in home dishwashers
and washing machines.

<HEAD>Poland Enacts Law Allowing Alternative To Military Service</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland-Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament passed a law Wednesday giving
conscientious objectors the right to choose alternative civilian
work to avoid the military draft.
   ``We consider it a success,'' said Jacek Czaputowicz, head of
the outlawed peace group Freedom and Peace. The organization has
waged a three-year campaign for the right to alternative service.
   The government denied Freedom and Peace created any pressure for
passing the law.
   Lawmakers in the Sejm, or parliament, passed the measure as
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was midway through a six-day visit
to Poland.
   Under the new law, young men may apply for alternative civilian
service for reasons of moral or religious belief. They would
otherwise have to serve two years in the Polish army, or, if
college graduates, one year.
   A draft board of military and civilian members will decide if
applicants are sincere in their beliefs. If conscientious objector
status is granted, the men will serve three years in civilian
service or two if they are university graduates.
   The alternative service will take place in state-owned
factories, according to the state-run news service PAP.
   Poland enacted the law ``in keeping with views expressed in the
United Nations and corresponding to international civil and
political rights covenants ratified by Poland,'' PAP said.
   The Sejm on June 17 also approved a change in the military oath,
removing a reference to serving beside the Soviet army. Freedom and
Peace also demanded that change.
   Czaputowicz said seven members of his group were detained in
Szczecin on Tuesday and Wednesday after they applied for a permit
to demonstrate during Wednesday's visit to that Baltic port city by
Gorbachev.
   The group had proposed a banner reading, ``OK, Gorby, thanks for
Afghanistan. When will you withdraw the troops from Poland?''
   The Soviets are in the process of withdrawing their more than
100,000 troops from Afghanistan. Western sources have recently
speculated that the Soviets might soon pull their estimated 65,000
troops from Hungary or more than 10,000 soldiers from Poland.

   The government is evaluating a British offer to
sell Kuwait sophisticated weapons, the defense minister announced
Wednesday.
   Sheik Nawaf Al-Ahmed also said a military deal that his country
concluded with the Soviet Union over the weekend involved 245
Soviet-made armored personnel carriers. He did not say whether the
agreement, which a newspaper said was worth $300 million, covered
other equipment.
   Kuwait's announcement came after another accord announced last
week in which Saudi Arabia agreed to buy a wide array of weapons
from Britain. The huge deal was estimated to be worth $10 billion.
   The Kuwaiti official spoke to reporters after a meeting with
visiting British Defense Secretary George Younger.
   The Kuwaiti minister provided no details of the weapons Kuwait
may purchase from Britain. Earlier reports said Younger's offer
included Tornado warplanes.
   Wednesday's announcement was made while Kuwaiti Crown Prince
Sheik Saad Abdullah Sabah was in Washington pressing for a
$1.9-billion arms deal involving 40 F-1-18 fighter-bombers and
Maverick missiles.
   However, Congress opposes including the missiles, and the
Kuwaitis have said they would turn to other sources to meet their
needs.

<HEAD>Senate Approves $59.1 Billion Appropriation for HUD, NASA, Other
Agencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved a $59.1 billion
appropriation bill Wednesday for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and 15 other independent agencies.
   The bill, approved by a 86-11 vote, cuts off virtually all funds
for the Urban Development Block Grant program, created more than 10
years ago to aid redevelopment of distressed cities. The Reagan
administration has opposed the program for the past eight years.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., proposed an amendment to move $30
million from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
UDAG but was defeated Tuesday on 64-22 vote.
   The legislation increases the appropriation for fiscal 1989,
beginning Oct. 1, by $2.4 billion for all 17 agencies over the
current year, which ends Sept. 30, and is some $409.7 million more
than requested by President Reagan.
   However, it is $633.4 million less than the appropriation
approved by the House earlier this year. A Senate-House conference
will iron out the differences before the measure is sent to the
White House.
   The legislation provides only about one-fifth of the amount
requested by the administration for a manned space station.
   Senior White House aides have said they would recommend that
Reagan veto the legislation since it provides only $200 million for
a proposed manned space station, $767.4 million less than the
administration requested.
   NASA Administrator James Fletcher issued a statement saying,
``We are disappointed at the Senate's action on funding for the
space station. If this is the ultimate outcome, it is a setback for
NASA and a blow to this country's future in space.''
   ``I hope the conference committee will reverse this action and
keep the space station on schedule,'' Fletcher said.
   The Senate appropriation is $702 million lower than the
House-approved amount for the space station. The Senate would use
the money either to phase out the program or to continue it until
the next administration determines its future.
   Other appropriations included in the measure are:
   _$12.9 billion for HUD, $1.3 billion more than requested by the
administration.
   _$5.4 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency, $611.8
million more than requested.
   _$10.1 billion NASA, $1.4 billion less than asked.
   _$1.9 billion for the National Science Foundation, $170 million
more than requested.
   _$28 billion for the Veterans Administration, $112.7 million
more than wanted by the administration.

<HEAD>State Takes Control of Debt-Ridden Pike County Schools' Finances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state took control of Kentucky's
third-largest school district's finances Wednesday, citing a budget
deficit estimated by consultants to have been as high as $3.3
million.
   The action by the State Board of Education means state
Superintendent John Brock's written approval will be needed for all
hiring and purchases by the Pike County district, which has 15,250
students in 30 schools.
   The board acted after two consultants it sent into the
mountainous eastern Kentucky district reported dozens of management
problems.
   ``Beyond what we see in writing, there are unique political
problems in Pike County at the present time,'' Brock said.
   ``I think the (state board) would have to take some
extraordinary action at this time. ... I think they need some
help,'' Brock said.
   He said the state veto over local hiring would relieve the local
board of some political pressure to dole out school jobs _ pressure
that has increased as layoffs increase in the coal industry,
according to the report by consultants Arnold Oaken and James
Melton.
   Brock also said it ``would remove that temptation'' for school
board candidates to promise jobs for votes. Three of the board's
five members are up for re-election in November.
   The chief reason for the state board's action, however, was Pike
County's third straight year of running a deficit budget.
   On paper, it has been cut from $3.3 million to about $300,000,
but that is illusory, Melton and Oaken told the board.
   The district soon will have to borrow $600,000 to keep
operating, increasing the debt to near $1 million again, and the
purchase of new school buses can be delayed no longer, they said.
   The local board has voted to close one elementary school, but
the report by Oaken and Melton said five should be closed, with 780
pupils redistributed. In the past, when the county has built new
schools, it has declined to close old ones, Melton said.
   It was not immediately known how long the state would manage
Pike County schools' finances under the seldom-used statute it
invoked. The action is less severe than a declaration of ``academic
bankruptcy,'' by which the state would take over actual management
of the school system.
   Brock said he would place a lieutenant in Pike County to oversee
the school system's finances. Brock said he had a former school
superintendent, whom he would not identify, in mind for the job.
   In Pikeville, school board Chairman Alvin Newsome said he
welcomed the state takeover, and 18-year board veteran Gifford
Varney said he hoped the action marked a turning point for the
district. But two other members said they believed the takeover had
been unnecessary.
   If Pike County voters were unhappy with board members, they
could elect someone else to do the job, said board member Carl
Biliter. He said the state action surprised him, but added, ``We
don't have no say over it because we were in debt.''

Doesn't</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday it expects
Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann to comply with an order
expelling him and seven colleagues, and President Reagan warned
that ``he's going to get a big surprise'' if he doesn't.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley was asked about the
possibility that Tunnermann may claim he has the right to stay in
Washington on grounds that he also is Nicaraguan ambassador to the
Organization of American States.
   ``It would be unprecedented for a foreign envoy to refuse to
comply with such an order as we have given to Ambassador
Tunnermann,'' she replied. ``We expect him to comply with our
order.''
   Reagan, who ordered Tunnermann's expulsion on Tuesday, was asked
Wednesday what additional steps the United States could take to
retaliate against Nicaragua's expulsion of eight U.S. diplomats.
   ``We've taken away their visas and they're going home,'' he said.
   When told that Tunnermann was resisting the order, the president
called out to reporters, ``He's going to get a big surprise.''
   At Tunnermann's request, the OAS permanent council will hold a
special meeting Thursday afternoon to discuss his expulsion. The
meeting was described as ``informative'' in nature, meaning that no
resolution will be introduced, a State Department official said.
   Reagan was queried as he left a signing ceremony for a Captive
Nations Week resolution in the White House Rose Garden, at which he
reiterated his support for rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan
government.
   ``I suggest to Congress: Isn't it time we give freedom fighters
in our own hemisphere the same consistent support we give to others
in distant lands?'' the president said.
   Earlier, Reagan met with the U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua,
Richard Melton, who said he and his seven colleagues were expelled
to intimidate opposition leaders with whom they had met in the
normal course of their work.
   Melton, at a news conference following a private meeting with
Reagan, said the president ``told me other things are being
considered'' as additional retaliation against Nicaragua's
Sandinista government. The ambassador declined to say what if any
specific steps were discussed.
   Melton said the diplomats expelled from Managua were ``selected
with malice aforethought to reduce the effectiveness of the embassy
in the performance of diplomatic functions.''
   He said the seven diplomats expelled with him had met with
members of the opposition because ``seeing all sections of society
is a normal function of an embassy.''
   ``I think the underlying purpose was to intimidate the
opposition itself,'' the ambassador said.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _The State Department formally asked the OAS to approve
Tunnermann's expulsion. Richard McCormack, the U.S. ambassador to
the international body, delivered a note to Ambassador Eladio
Knipping of the Dominican Republic, who also is president of the
OAS permament council.
   _Tunnermann met with the ambassadors to the OAS from Mexico,
Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Peru to discuss
future strategy, a State Department official said. Tunnermann was
seeking support for his position that each hemispheric country
should have the absolute right to appoint OAS envoys irrespective
of U.S. wishes.
   But the State Department official, who spoke only on condition
of anonymity, said most of the ambassadors reacted cautiously to
Tunnermann's appeals and that some felt the Sandinistas had made a
big mistake in expelling Melton and his seven colleagues.
   _On Capitol Hill, senators angered by Melton's expulsion and the
shutting down of La Prensa and the Catholic radio station in
Managua, overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning the
Sandinista government for ``dramatic new steps in brutality.'' The
non-binding sense of the Senate resolution, approved by a 91-4
vote, also warned that further human rights violations could
trigger renewed U.S. military aid to the Contra rebels.
   ``We are moving now because the Sandinista goons have been in
the streets of Managua again ... because the light of freedom has
been nearly snuffed out again,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said a bipartisan group of
lawmakers is drafting a House resolution that ``will call upon the
Nicaraguan government to reopen the organs of free expression and
repeals the law that permits the response they made.''
   _Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee attempted to hold
a public hearing to question Melton on the reasons behind his
expulsion but were blocked by an objection lodged by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., an opponent of U.S. aid to the Contras.
   Committee chairman David Boren, D-Okla., told reporters that he
and other committee members had questioned Melton privately and
found no indication that either he or any of his fellow diplomats
were engaged in espionage or other acts thatmight have justified
their expulsion.
   _Federal prosecutors in Miami unsealed an indictment charging
seven people, including the brother of Contra leader Adolfo Calero,
with illegally supplying mercenaries and weapons to the Contras.
Mario Calero of New Orleans was accused of recruiting and paying
for mercenaries with the help of a Texas millionaire, Maco Stewart,
and anti-Communist Cuban activists from the Miami area.
   Also among those indicted were Thomas Posey, head of
Alabama-based Civilian Materiel Assistance, and Jack Terrell, a
former mercenary who later blew the whistle on the alleged illegal
operation. All seven are accused of violating the U.S. Neutrality
Act, which bars hostile actions against foreign governments from
U.S. soil.
   At his news conference, Melton denied that the U.S. diplomats
were engaged in ``activities complementary to the state terrorism
the administration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan is carrying out
against Nicaragua,'' as charged by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Manuel d'Escoto.
   At the State Department, Mrs. Oakley again refused to divulge
the nature of the ``abuses'' Tunnermann and others are alleged to
have committed.

   Iraqi forces surged across the border
Wednesday and seized the western Iran city of Dehloran, and 20,000
Iranians were killed or wounded in the latest offensive, official
Iraqi radio reported.
   Official Iranian and Iraqi news agencies also reported fighting
in Iraq's northern Kurdistan province, where the Iranians still
held two major positions in the Penjwin and Hajj Omran border towns.
   Baghdad radio said the capture of Dehloran, 30 miles inside
Iran, was part of the third phase of the ``We Depend on God''
offensive.
   Iraqi forces have recaptured Iranian-held territory in southern
Iraq in recent battlefield victories.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted an unidentified senior
military commander as saying 20,000 Iranians have been killed or
wounded and 5,155 captured since the latest thrust was launched
Tuesday.
   There was no confirmation from Tehran of the Iraqi reports. But
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, acknowledged fighting in the southern sector of the
733-mile warfront.
   Baghdad radio interrupted regular programming to announce the
latest victory. On Tuesday, the Iranians were chased out of the
Zubaidat region, losing their last positions in southern Iraq.
   The broadcast said President Saddam Hussein personally
supervised Wednesday's battle, launched by the elite Presidential
Guard.
   Hussein and other officials have said land offensives mounted
since April were designed to liberate Iraqi territory and that
Iraqi forces would not seek to occupy Iranian land.
   After the liberation of the oil-rich Majnoon islands in a June
offensive, the Iraqis also pushed about 30 miles into Iranian
territory, chasing fleeing Iranians.
   They withdrew several days later, apparently after destroying
the Iranians' defenses across the border.
   State-run Iraqi New Agency said the Penjwin basin, but not the
town, was recaptured Wednesday and that the Iraqis were inching
toward the border.
   The Iranian agency said the attacks were repulsed and that
Iranian warplanes bombarded Iraqi troops in the region.
   Iran said Tuesday its troops withdrew from Halbja, a strategic
mountain town in the region, where Iranian-backed Kurdish rebels
live.
   Halabja, Penjwin and Hajj Omran were captured in an Iranian
thrust last March. At the time, Iran said that about 5,000 Kurdish
rebels, most of whom are backed by Iran, were killed and 7,000
wounded in Iraqi chemical bomb attacks on Halabja.
   The Iraqis began recapturing their lost territories in April.
They said they seized about 133 strategic heights in the northern
region.
   Simultaneously, they launched assaults in the south, recapturing
the southern Faw peninsula in April and the Shalamcheh and Majnoon
islands in May and June.
   An Iranian retreat from Zubaidat in a four-hour battle Tuesday
capped these victories in the nearly eight-year war.
   Meanwhile, in a letter released Wednesday at the United Nations,
Iraq accused Iran of barring visits by the Red Cross to at least
30,000 Iraqi prisoners of war and of torturing and killing
prisoners.
   In a July 4 letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, Iraq's U.N. Ambassador, Ismat Kittani, quoted from a
report by the International Committee of the Red Cross to his
government.
   Kittani also said that ``the Iranian regime has subjected the
prisoners to every atrocity from which a civilized human being
would shrink.
   ``These include killing prisoners who are bound by ropes,
cutting off their limbs and burying them alive.''
   In a follow-up note sent Friday, Kittani said that when Iraqi
forces recaptured the Mawat region in northeastern Iraq near the
Iranian border, they ``found the remains of considerable numbers of
Iraqi prisoners.''
   ``It is quite clear that the Iranian regime killed them,
mutilated their corpses and burned them, after tying up some of
them with ropes,'' Kittani said in his note.

<HEAD>Utility Kicks In $2 Million To Keep Nuclear Project Going</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the owners of the stalled Seabrook
nuclear power plant said Wednesday it will pay an extra $2 million
in maintenance to keep the project afloat until Sept. 1 and gain
more time to secure financing for another year.
   ``We decided that to allow Seabrook to continue in an orderly
fashion, we had better do something,'' said Robert E. Busch, senior
vice president of finance for Northeast Utilities of Connecticut.
``The idea (is to) buy some breathing room to work something out
for the longer term.''
   Seabrook would have run out of cash in two weeks without the
added funds.
   ``We wouldn't have done this interim step if we didn't think a
long-term arrangement was possible. I think it will be a complex,
difficult job, but doable,'' Busch said in a telephone interview
from NU offices in Berlin, Conn.
   Busch declined to elaborate on negotiations to get funding to
keep Seabrook alive for at least another year _ by which time plant
officials hope to win a commercial operating license.
   If a deal can't be reached, ``then I think the Seabrook project
has some pretty severe problems,'' Busch said.
   The $5.5 billion, 1,150-megawatt Seabrook reactor, owned by 12
New England utilities and holding companies, was completed two
years ago but remains idle for lack of federally approved
evacuation plans.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has refused to submit
evacuation plans for six Massachusetts communities within
Seabrook's 10-mile emergency planning zone, saying such plans would
never work.
   Every month's delay in licensing the plant adds about $50
million to its price tag in maintenance, financing and other costs,
officials have said.
   Seabrook's latest cash crunch began when directors of
Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co. voted in June to
withhold its maintenance payment for July and try to sell its 11.6
percent stake in Seabrook. They contended that rising costs made
Seabrook financially unattractive even if it were allowed to begin
operation. MMWEC already has invested $875 million in Seabrook on
behalf of 28 utilities in Massachusetts and eight in other states.
   Seabrook's other major owners have said they cannot assume
MMWEC's payments or buy its share of the reactor. Lead Seabrook
owner Public Service Company of New Hampshire is under bankruptcy
protection and other key participants also face financial woes.
   MMWEC directors voted Wednesday to withhold its August payment
of about $2 million.
   NU, New England's largest electric utility, owns 4.1 percent of
Seabrook through the Connecticut Light & Power Co.
   In return for covering MMWEC's $2 million maintenance payment,
NU President Bernard Fox said Public Service and three other
Seabrook owners agreed to buy 250 megawatts of surplus power from
NU during the next year.
   Busch said it was a ``remote'' possibility that NU would buy
MMWEC's Seabrook share.

   John Glenn was in the running from beginning to
end, Jesse Jackson was out from the outset. Eight others would be
drawn into the process as Michael Dukakis searched for a Democratic
running mate, and the decision finally narrowed to two men.
   They were Ohio Sen. Glenn and Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen and both,
in Dukakis' mind, had the right stuff: experience in national
politics and the addition of ideological and geographical balance
to the ticket.
   In that head-to-head comparison, Bentsen emerged as the victor
based on his record in the Senate and the strategic implications of
his inclusion on the ticket, sources said, winning out over the
heroic legacy of the Ohioan most considered the favorite for the
Democratic vice presidential nomination.

   For George Bush, the search for a Republican
running mate began in earnest on Wednesday as he planned to meet
with key advisers to discuss the selection process. A spokeswoman
said Bush has no intention of ``parading people around.''
   Bush campaign sources said the vice president likely will use
private polling to gauge the vote-drawing appeal of various ticket
combinations as he moves toward a decision.
   Meanwhile, Bush decided to keep a low profile during most of the
Democratic convention next week. He extended a planned three-day
fishing trip with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III to five
days.

   Jesse Jackson, his 1988 presidential campaign
winding down, takes to the road Thursday en route to the Democratic
National Convention _ while angry supporters search for a signal of

   The possibilities range from unity to confrontation.
   Jackson's words and actions as he finally acknowledges Michael
Dukakis' victory _ and Lloyd Bentsen spot on the ticket _ will not
only shape the tone of the Democratic National Convention here
starting Monday. They will also mold the enthusiasm that his
supporters give to the Democratic ticket in the fall.

   U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf do not
routinely monitor radio communications between airliners and air
traffic controllers, and have not changed that practice since an
American warship shot down Iran Air Flight 655, Pentagon officials
said Wednesday.
   Iranian officials have said the A300 Airbus had communicated
with air traffic control at Bandar Abbas, Iran, in English, the
international language for airlines, and that if the USS Vincennes
was listening, it might not have mistaken the airliner for an
Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Iran has asked the United Nations Security Council and
International Civil Aviation Organization to review the July 3
incident. And the Pentagon is conducting its own investigation,
which spokesman Dan Howard has said will determine what radio and
radar information was available to the skipper of the Vincennes,
Capt. Will C. Rogers III.

   When Herman Krone's drought-stricken farm
in southern Illinois was picked for a visit Thursday by President
Reagan, his corn crop was shriveling and his pastures were parched.
   But his farm recorded nearly 2 inches of rain this week, turning
the fields into muddy pastures.
   And 25 miles away in Marion, near the Williamson County Airport
where Air Force One will land, motorists drove through flooded
downtown streets.
   Still, agriculture experts insist that recent rain _ up to 4
inches over some of the flatland region _ won't help much of the
already damaged corn crop. But the Reagan visit, they say, is a
good gesture on the president's part and should help get federal
aid for farmers who have substantial crop loss.
   Reagan is scheduled for stops in Moline, Ill., and neighboring
Davenport, Iowa, before he returns to Washington.

   The constant shifting of a restless atmosphere
is making the Earth wobble like a clothes washer with an
off-balance load, a study says.
   Roving masses of air pushing on the planet's surface cause at
least some of a recently discovered wobble in the Earth's axis of
spin, researchers said.
   The wobble is very slight, but it means the Earth can be used
``as an instrument to test things about the atmosphere as a
whole,'' said researcher T. Marshall Eubanks.
   An analysis of the wobble is published in Thursday's issue of

<HEAD>Beware Those Corporate Evaluation Forms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expert business witness in court cases states
that the personnel files of many corporations are crammed with
explosives so unstable they can blow up with little agitation.
   Such files, says Eugene Jennings, should be purged, since those
``explosions'' are occurring with growing frequency and could be
extremely costly in terms of dollars and reputations.
   The files to which Jennings refers are those containing
evaluations of officers' performances based on subjective and
interpretive criteria rather than hard, factual information.
   Increasingly, he says, officers are suing fellow officers for
tortious _ a tort is a legal term for a wrongful or injurious civil
act _ interference with their economic relationship to the employer.
   As a confidential counselor to top executives and corporations,
Jennings is most concerned about those instances in which officers
make unfair, improper or unreasonable judgments about another
officer's performance and career.
   While complete data is difficult to come by, partly because most
suits are settled out of court, Jennings says that 26 such
complaints were filed in New York state in 1986 and 15 in
Massachusetts last year.
   For many years Jennings, a management professor at Michigan
State University, has helped corporations set forth theories
enabling them to defend themselves against such suits based on
established criteria used by many companies.
   But today, he states, such practices carry less weight, no
matter how commonly used. This is especially so, he says, ``if the
evaluation criteria are based on such interpretative and subjective
items as common sense, good judgment, ambition and loyalty.
   These are what Jennings derisively calls UUB, an acronym for
unintelligent, undefinable babble.
   ``Nothing will cause a corporate case to fall apart than to use
such undescriptive words as leadership, motivation, originality and
style. Nobody defines them in the same way,'' he says.
   Jennings says he is finding it more difficult to lay out a
business's defense in such suits.
   He cites this actual example: For nine years Mr. X, an
executive, received all 10s on performance, the result of
subjective, interpretive categories. A new boss was named.
Suddenly, Mr. X. received 9s and 8s, and then 7s.
   Among other things, lawyers for Mr. X. learned on examination
that the new boss interpreted leadership to mean discipline, while
the old boss held to the belief that it meant motivation. On just
what was Mr. X being rated?
   The term motivation causes all sorts of trouble. In a certain
case, one officer-boss maintained that motivation meant making
people work harder, while another said it was to make them feel
better.
   So vague are the terms, even to those using them, says Jennings,
that in another case corporate officers rehearsed consistent
definitions prior to examination in court. To their humiliation,
their ploy was uncovered.
   In the past, says Jennings, corporations believed that officers
did not come under rules that apply to other employees,
particularly regarding discrmination and especially discrimination
of women and minorities.
   But, says Jennings, ``all human beings come under a rule that
nobody can interfere unreasonably and improperly with the economic
relationship between an employee and employer.''
   He contends that when subjective criteria are used, it is an
invitation for ``ingrained, conscious and unconscious biases to
come into play, even when applied without discriminatory intent.''
   For such reasons, he says, a trend is developing among
corporations to clear up the evaluation process. Among other
things, it means getting rid of standard forms, says Jennings, who
is helping companies make changes.
   A technique Jennings recommends is to have a superior and
subordinate agree at the start of each year what must be done in
the job, what reasonable resources must be utilized and what
timeframe is needed for results.
   At the end of the year, says Jennings, the subordinate is
evaluated strictly on these criteria, thus making the performance
evaluation detailed, objective and activity-based.
   He concedes that such a technique might not always be possible.
Then, he says, it is far better that a performance evaluation be as
general as possible as to the subordinate officer's
responsibilities.
   It can be as general as this: Mr. Y is in charge of corporate
public relations, and so is expected to fulfill all the duties that
normally are associated with this activity by reasonable and proper
methods.
   While it may not be as effective as the annual conference-type
evaluation, Jennings believes the general format is far less
hurtful in a legal sense than if subjective, interpretive critieria
are used.
   Again he warns companies to beware of subjective criteria in
selecting, promoting or rewarding individuals. He suggests that if
they have been doing so, they should purge their files and begin
again.

<HEAD>New Top Bishop Of Methodists Says Blacks Still Marked</HEAD>

   As the new president of the United Methodist
Council of Bishops, Bishop Ernest T. Dixon Jr. says that no matter
how impressive the institution or exalted the position, he's
regarded, primarily, as black.
   ``That's what identifies you,'' he says, ``your blackness.''
   He's not brooding about it, or critical, but simply talking
plainly about a seemingly intractable and restrictive reality.
   A genial, lanky man who laughs easily, Dixon first encountered
that aberration in himself in reverse as a youth, but says he
outgrew it. It still pigeonholes him though, he says, in its
narrow-lensed way.
   ``You're considered, first of all, not a human being, not a
Christian, not a bishop, but a black. I'm not ashamed of it. But it
hurts sometimes.''
   It's the ingrained, slanted attitude toward blacks of a
predominantly white society, even though it ostensibly rejects
racism, Dixon says, and he notes that it comes up in all sorts of
incidental ways.
   ``Even in my present position, folks don't ever let you forget
you are different,'' he said in an interview at the denomination's
recent governing conference in St. Louis.
   ``You're a `black bishop.' People don't refer to white bishops
as white, but to black bishops as black. I don't think it's
intentional, but people come up and say, `Oh, you're one of our
black bishops.'''
   Dixon, 65, of San Antonio, Texas, chief ecclesiastical leader of
the mainly white denomination of nearly 10 million for the 1988-89
term, has a special understanding of racial bias because he once
shared some of it.
   ``I gained some insight into white Americans's stereotyping of
black persons from experience in my early years,'' he said. A rangy
man, with whispy-haired, balding head, he squinted his eyes in
reminiscence.
   He said that in his youth in San Antonio, where he now heads the
church, Mexicans used to be put down below blacks.
   ``I used to hear my father and grandfather talk about Mexican
sharecroppers as shiftless and irresponsibile, going off and
leaving their crops.
   ``I had some stereotypes myself. I hadn't had the opportunity to
associate with Mexicans as my peers. I hadn't reflected on how they
were rejected then, the kind of places they had to live, how they
were deprived of education.''
   Not until ``you grow up'' does one break free of the baseless
stereotyping, Dixon said. ``Your attitude changes.'' At least it
should, he said, although blacks still are often lumped as blacks,
rather than seen as individuals.
   However, among his church's approximately 100 bishops over which
he now presides, he said, ``I think we have achieved a degree of
respect and collegiality that enables us to work together.
   ``Yet we constantly have to monitor each other to keep black
bishops from being oversensitive and keep white bishops from being
patronizing.''
   Dixon succeeds Bishop Earl G. Hunt Jr. of Lakeland, Fla.
   Asked what should be the main emphasis of a denomination that
has lost nearly 2 million members in the last 22 years, Dixon said:
   ``I would hope we're moving in a new direction focused on our
local congregations, on equipping the saints. Our efforts must be
to strengthen and revitalize the local church and also start new
congregations.''
   He said a long, sequence of events previously had absorbed
denominational energies _ social justice causes and organizational
restructuring.
   ``The whole idea of evangelism became almost abandoned,'' he
said, but it's now in the forefront. ``We need more biblical
preaching, more study of the Bible in small groups.
   ``Congregations that are rooted in Scripture, with an
opportunity to be involved in Bible study _ those churches are
growing. At the same time, we must also have Christian outreach
ministries of community service.
   ``You can't preach Jesus Christ and him crucified without
dealing with basic social issues of feeding the hungry and caring
for the dispossessed.''
   Dixon did his early church service under racial segregation. He
led small black congregations, directed extension training of
``rural Negro ministers'' at Alabama's Tuskeegee Institute, oversaw
black Christian education in Texas.
   Afterward, he worked for the national church's local church
division, later headed Philander Smith College in Little Rock,
Ark., before joining the denomination's program council in Dayton,
Ohio in 1969.
   That was just one year after the denomination integrated its
separate black jurisdiction with whites. Elected a bishop in 1972,
Dixon served in Topeka, Kan., until 1980 when he shifted to San
Antonio.
   ``I'm home again,'' he said.

<HEAD>After Tax Reform, Keoghs Still Appealing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With all the savings and investment tax breaks
that have been curtailed or rearranged in the past couple of years,
it's nice to contemplate one that came through largely intact _
Keogh plans for the self-employed.
   Keoghs are sometimes thought of as the province of professionals
on the upper rungs of the income ladder.
   But in fact, they can play a useful role in tax and retirement
planning for anyone who has self-employment income _ including
moonlighters who are covered by a separate pension plan at their
primary job.
   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 put limits on deductions for
contributions to individual retirement accounts if you are covered
by a pension plan. But it set no such constraints for Keoghs.
   In many ways, Keoghs are very similar to IRAs. Both are accounts
set up with a custodian that allow you to make annual contributions.
   As the money grows, the interest, dividends or capital gains it
earns can compound tax-free until withdrawals begin, at age 59{ or
later if you want to avoid a 10 percent penalty tax.
   But while IRA contributions are limited to $2,000 a year per
person, the maximum for Keoghs can run as high as $30,000.
   Keoghs originated in the early 1960s (they are named for Vincent
Keogh, a New York congressman who sponsored the bill that created
them).
   Nowadays, they come in several forms. One, known as a ``money
purchase'' plan, permits you to contribute as much as 20 percent of
your self-employment income annually, up to the $30,000 ceiling.
   For a second type, known as a ``profit-sharing'' plan, the
maximum percentage is 13.043, again with the $30,000 cap.
   The difference in percentage limits naturally prompts many
people to opt for a money-purchase plan.
   But there is another point to be considered in making the
choice. Once you have set a given percentage contribution to a
money-purchase plan, you are required to keep making that
contribution each year.
   ``Your profit-sharing contribution, on the other hand, is
optional,'' notes Albert Ellentuck at the accounting firm of
Laventhol & Horwath. ``If you need your money for other purposes,
you're not obliged to contribute it.''
   Adds Michael Leonetti, a Buffalo Grove, Ill., financial planner,
writing in the current edition of the American Association of
Individual Investors' AAII Journal: ``This is a dramatic advantage
over the money purchase arrangement, because of its flexibility.''
   Ellentuck notes that a compromise option, known as a ``paired
plan,'' can be set up that is part money purchase and part
profit-sharing.
   Still another variation, called a defined benefit plan, can be
set up to pay out a predetermined amount each year after you retire.
   These are most likely to be a good choice for people fairly
close to retirement, Leonetti says, while younger savers usually
will come out best with a plan covered by the annual contribution
limits.
   Keoghs can be managed conservatively, aggressively or somewhere
in between in just about any kind of financial investment _ bank
certificates of deposit, mutual funds, stocks and so forth.
   You cannot, however, put your Keogh money in collectibles such
as rare coins or antiques. ``The legislators wanted to keep
taxpayers from using their retirement dollars to furnish their
homes,'' Ellentuck observes.
   If you are the sort that distrusts paper investments, Keogh
savers are permitted to buy precious metals coins issued by the
U.S. government.
   When it comes time to start withdrawing from a Keogh account,
you'll owe taxes on the money you take out. Even then, though, you
can avail yourself of another break known as five-year forward
averaging.
   ``When you take out your funds in one lump sum, you average your
taxes over five years rather than pay one enormous tax on the full
amount,'' Ellentuck points out. ``That's a considerable tax break.''

   Bill Maher sometimes has trouble explaining
to people that in the NBC movie ``Out of Time,'' his co-star plays
his great-grandson, and they are about the same age.
   That's because in this comic adventure, the great-grandson is
21st-century policeman Channing Taylor, played by Bruce Abbott, who
has traveled back in time 100 years to catch a master criminal.
   Maher plays Max Taylor, Channing's great-grandfather. To people
in the year 2088, Max is a legendary figure honored for pioneering
scientific crime-fighting. But in 1988, Max is only a rookie and
the laughingstock of the police force because his inventions
haven't been perfected and often go wrong.
   Unaware Channing is his great-grandson, Max teams up with him to
nab the killer Markus, played by rock star Adam Ant.
   ``Out of Time,'' which NBC will televise Sunday, is a pilot for
a possible midseason series, although as with all network series
for next season, its schedule is uncertain because of the Writers
Guild strike.
   If the show does go to series, said Maher, ``We plan to keep it
in 1988, although we could go into the future if we get the old
time machine fixed. Actually, it ran out of fuel. It takes unleaded
and they only had regular.''
   The pilot was executive produced and directed by Emmy winner
Robert Butler, who directed the pilot of ``Hill Street Blues.''
   Maher said he was intrigued by the conflict that is central to
the plot. ``This guy who comes in from another time is groping
around like a fish out of water. At the same time everybody's
laughing at my character. Yet this guy knows that in the future I'm
going to be somebody important.''
   The movie also stars Rebecca Schaeffer (``My Sister Sam'') and
Kristian Alfonso (``Days of Our Lives'').
   Maher, a standup comedian who has appeared on ``The Tonight
Show'' and ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' starred in the NBC
comedy ``Sara,'' long since canceled, but revived for a summer run.
His other series, ``Hard Knocks,'' is also in reruns, on Showtime.
   ``Sara'' was set in a law firm with Geena Davis (``The Fly'')
playing the title role. Maher was the pushy, chauvinistic lawyer
Marty Lang, antagonist of a gay lawyer played by Bronson Pinchot,
who now stars on ABC's ``Perfect Strangers.'' The show was produced
by Gary David Goldberg, the creator of ``Family Ties.''
   ``I went to read for `Sara' in Gary Goldberg's office,'' Maher
said. ``His baby was in a playpen in the office and the baby
screamed all during my reading. Maybe that's where he got the idea
for the kid in the show. The kid belonged to Sara's neighbor.
Sara'd say, `Marty's here,' and the kid would say, `Yeah, the guy
nobody likes.'''
   The show was canceled at the end of its first season despite
reasonably good ratings.
   ``We were up against `Dynasty' when `Dynasty' was hot. But the
real reason is that it was my fault,'' he joked. ``I screwed up.
   ``They never tell the actors why a show is canceled. They don't
even tell you when they cancel a show. I went to New York to
represent the show for the announcement of the new fall season. I
was at the Waldorf-Astoria, and 10 minutes before I'm supposed to
go down I get a call. `Don't go to the breakfast, Mr. Maher.' They
didn't even tell me the show was canceled.''
   Maher and Tommy Hinkley play goofy detectives in ``Hard
Knocks.'' ``We never spent much time on cases,'' he said. ``It was
really a character comedy. It was more like `The Odd Couple.'''
   Maher grew up in Bergen County, N.J., across the Hudson River
from New York City. His father is a retired radio news editor at
NBC News.
   He said the first time he was on Letterman's show, his father
was still working at NBC.
   ``I got bumped, and I had to physically restrain my dad from
going up and punching Dave Letterman. I said, `Dad, those things
happen.'''
   Maher recently completed work on a comedy feature film called
``The Piranha Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death.''
   ``It's a parody of `Heart of Darkness,' which was adapted for
`Apocalypse Now,''' he said. ``The Piranha Women are a group of
ultrafeminists led by Adrienne Barbeau. She's Kurtz. Shannon Tweed
is Margo, who goes in to find her. I play her guide, who's a
swaggering adventurer. The Piranha Women are served by a group of
very sensitive men called the Donahues.''

   Strange winds are blowing these days, which
prompts the advice that you hold onto your hat.
   The winds arise not so much from the anomalies that are inherent
in every survey, whether it be in meteorology, economics or popular
music, but from the tendency to extrapolate those anomalies to
infinity.
   The drought covering much of the nation's agricultural areas has
generated a spate of speculation about the greenhouse effect, a
situation in which the pollutants of society are trapping heat and
raising the Earth's temperature.
   In economics, the odd convolutions over the past year have
produced extreme forecasts of boom and bust, inflation and
deflation, higher and lower interest rates, a new level of
prosperity and a return to the dirty, dusty 1930s.
   Surveys served up daily show Americans on a new level of
affluence and poverty worse than ever, consumers more confident
than ever and more fearful, too, jobs going begging but
unemployment never worse for some people.
   In such times it is difficult, almost impossible, to maintain a
historical perspective, to avoid emotional involvement, to keep a
cold eye on the larger picture, to step back a distance from the
events.
   Each day's statistics are projected beyond eternity and warnings
issued, but the statistics themselves might be revised in the
meantime. It happens all the time to jobless numbers, retail sales,
corporate profits and more.
   The strongest gusts seem to blow whenever things are not fully
understood, as when the stock market crashed, or when an extreme of
any sort is reached in prices, interest rates, crop statistics or
commodity futures.
   Such events spur speculation, and the speculation is good for at
least a month or so, or whenever the newer figures are reported or
the old ones corrected. In turn, this sets off additional gusts
from another quadrant.
   In the recent past a newsletter writer, Howard Ruff, renamed his
periodical the Ruff Times, representing his re-transformation to a
bear. Robert Prechter, well known stock market optimist, now
preaches despair. Countless others who posed as bulls now shiver
amid dismal echoes of the 1930s.
   Over a longer time frame, these are some of the gusts that seem
to have blown themselves out:
   _The stock market crash will cause a depression.
   _The dollar will continue to fall almost freely.
   _As the economy's growth continues a rise of inflation is
inevitable.
   _The same factors will push interest rates into the double
digits.
   _U.S. manufacturing cannot compete with foreigners.
   _Social Security will go broke.
   Determining which events are winds of economic storms destined
to grow violent, and which are meandering, meaningless gusts that
will spend themselves is a challenge today for ordinary folks and
those who claim expertise.
   Winds, events and perspective change. The farmland drought isn't
forever, and neither, perhaps, are the big budget and trade
deficits and other economic problems that have been projected into
eternity.

   The biggest thing to hit South Pond in
the 97 years since George Kittle's grandfather built his camp there
was the Great Blowdown of 1950.
   ``It took three men three days to cut their way from the lake to
the camp with chainsaws,'' Kittle recalled in a visit to the mossy
old cabins.
   The hemlocks have grown back tall around Kittle's rustic camp,
and South Pond is much the same as it has been for generations: a
quiet wilderness lake welcoming loons, ospreys and occasional
canoeists.
   But that may soon change. Kittle and others fear South Pond and
the rest of the 6-million-acre Adirondack Park, the biggest
wilderness area east of the Mississippi, are about to be altered as
dramatically as they were when that windstorm roared through the
mountain passes and flattened a forest.
   This time, however, the scars will be permanent.
   Within a few years, canoeists may find condominiums clustered
along favorite lakes and rivers, and hikers may look down from high
peaks to see the roofs of second-home subdivisions.
   ``Millions of people will come to the Adirondacks in the next
generations,'' said Dick Beamish, a wilderness guide and spokesman
for the Adirondack Council, a preservation group. ``They will find
something degraded, chopped up through the efforts of big
developers, unless we act quickly to preserve the last of our
natural legacy.''
   Unlike other parks in the United States, which are publicly
owned, the Adirondack Park is about 40 percent state forest and 60
percent private land.
   The state land, called the Forest Preserve, is protected as
``forever wild.'' But 3.5 million acres of private land are
interpersed with that, including more than 100 hamlets and
villages. Year-round residents number 120,000; the population
swells by 90,000 each summer.
   Land values rose and development surged in the late 1960s, with
construction of the Adirondack Northway, a superhighway link
between New York City and Montreal.
   By 1971, developers had proposed several 10,000-lot subdivisions
in the Adirondack outback. The plans were scuttled in 1973 with
creation of the Adirondack Park Agency, which controls development
through some of the strictest zoning regulations in the nation.
   Conservationists hailed the APA's creation, but many locals
denounced it as a blow to development in an economically depressed
region where the jobless rate is sometimes several times the state
average.
   Now it appears the APA might lack the power to prevent profound
changes in the Adirondack landscape.
   ``We are seeing a surge in development,'' said Robert Glennon,
counsel and acting director of the APA. ``It's not just hotels in
the hamlets; the backcountry is being subdivided as well.''
   Developers, now familiar with the complex APA law, have learned
to tailor their plans to slip through loopholes, Glennon said,
especially along the park's coveted, crystalline lakes.
   For example, more than half the park's private land lies within
the strictest APA zone, requiring nearly 43 acres for each
building. Yet Beamish points out that if a developer leaves enough
vacant land in the woods, hundreds of houses could be clustered
along a lake front.
   ``It has become apparent that the APA isn't enough to protect
the park,'' said Beamish. ``We could still have half-a-million new
houses in the Adirondacks with that plan.''
   Permit applications increased by more than one-third in 1987,
Glennon said. The 204 applications received in the first four
months of this year include plans for townhouses, condominiums,
housing developments, motels, marinas and sewage plants. A dozen
projects would include 30 to 150 housing units each.
   Much of the development is aimed at villages where APA powers
are limited and zoning is left to local governments. Proposals
include a 250-unit hotel and convention complex with 100 condos in
Schroon Lake; 184 townhouses in Speculator, where the year-round
population is 375, and a 95-unit development in Inlet, a hamlet of
200.
   While the hamlets are seeing the most concentrated growth,
preservationists are more concerned about remote sections of the
Adirondacks, where timber companies are starting to put tens of
thousands of forested acres on the market.
   ``That's where the battle really has to be fought, if the
character of the park is to be maintained,'' said George Davis, a
leading voice in the preservation movement. ``And that's where the
big subdividers are going.''
   The Adirondack Council has sharply criticized the state
Department of Environmental Conservation's sluggishness in buying
Adirondack land. Of $250 million allocated in a 1986 bond act for
land purchases around the state, about $2 million has been spent,
for one 14,000-acre tract. In that time, a single developer bought
13,000 acres to subdivide, said Glennon.

   Robert Bathrick, director of lands and forests for the
department, countered that purchase time had been ``cut in half by
streamlining the process,'' but added, ``We'll never be in the same
position as private developers.''
   The Adirondack Council has identified about 300,000 acres it
says the state should buy or acquire easements on to consolidate
fragmented wilderness areas and preserve panoramic vistas.
   Some preservationists, fearing the state cannot compete with
developers, are looking for other ways to save the Adirondacks.
   ``I never thought I'd see the day when I'd go talk to a
developer,'' said Davis. ``But now I've begun to think that's the
way we'll save the Adirondack Park _ along with getting the state
to buy more land.''
   Davis, as APA staff ecologist and planning director, helped
draft the zoning plan and later worked as program director for the
Adirondack Council. Now he is an independent consultant for the
Council and its spinoff organization, the Adirondack Land Trust, a
non-profit group that preserves private land by holding
conservation easements.
   Instead of trying to stop development, Davis is trying to get
developers to tailor their projects to harmonize with the
environment. He is pleased by the response _ especially from Patten
Corp., whose aggressive subdividing angered wilderness advocates in
New England and New York's Catskill Mountains a few years ago.
   ``We were ready to do battle when Patten came up here two years
ago,'' said Davis. ``But the fellow who heads their Adirondack
office, Dan Christmas, is working in a way that takes into account
the fact that this is a park. He's talking to environmental groups,
and backing off or making changes in sensitive areas.''
   Last fall, Patten gave the Adirondack Land Trust a conservation
easement protecting 322 acres along the Oswegatchie River, a
popular canoe route. Although the APA map would allow 38 homes,
Patten agreed to restrict future development to 19 homes.
   Kittle has turned to the Adirondack Council in hopes of
persuading a developer on South Pond to make similar concessions.
   The mile-long lake is surrounded by state forest and a few
private tracts, including one house and three camps.
   Kittle, a retired schoolteacher who lives in Connecticut, has
been coming to South Pond since he was a child. The camp his
grandfather built in 1891 is a collection of one-room cabins with
no electricity, no plumbing, no phone, no road. Kittle paddles out
there in a canoe just big enough for him and his dog, to spend a
quiet week or two.
   Now, he's afraid South Pond won't be so quiet any more. The
Finch-Pruyn Paper Co. recently won town board approval for a
subdivision with 14 150-foot lots clustered across the lake from
Kittle's camp.
   The Adirondack Council wrote to Finch-Pruyn, hoping to convince
the company it should revise its plans.
   ``Usually, we're on the side of preserving, not developing,''
said Beamish. ``But in this case, we feel the salvation of that
lake will be if the developer does it right.''
   R.J. Carota, president of Finch-Pruyn, said the company was
considering the suggestions.
   ``The zoning law would let us put in 14 lots, but the Adirondack
Council says five lots, set back further with trees left along the
lakefront, would be better,'' Carota said. ``That seems reasonable
to us. As it stands, we have no immediate plans to proceed with any
development.''
   ``I'm not opposed to development,'' said Kittle, gazing over the
lake as a misty rain obscured the opposite shore. ``I think it's
inevitable. But it has to be done in a sensitive way.
   ``We have to ask, what's going to happen to the loons and the
osprey, the deer and the beaver, when all these houses are built?
Are we going to destroy the very thing that we've worked so hard to
preserve?''

<TEXT>
   Director Ingmar Bergman is turning 70,
having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking
in a run of theater successes.
   Bergman is quietly celebrating his July 14 birthday at his
retreat at Faro, a rugged island of beaches and pine trees in the
Baltic Sea, with some of his eight children and his fifth wife,
Ingrid.
   Associates describe his health as good, although he suffers from
a painful hip. But Gote Eriksson, planning director of the Royal
Dramatic Theater, said Bergman was ``in good form'' at the premier
of his latest play in April, and postponed a hip operation which
had been scheuled for May.
   Bergman, whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely
touched by others, says he has made his last movie. That was his
1982 triumph ``Fanny and Alexander,'' which won four Academy Awards.
   But he is hardly slowing down, and has theater productions
scheduled in Sweden until 1991.
   In April he scored a critical and box office sensation with his
stage production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night.'' His autobiography, ``Lanterna Magica,'' was a Swedish
bestseller when it was published last year.
   His Swedish-language production of ``Hamlet,'' put in a modern
setting, was panned by some critics here, but was a sensation in
Florence, Italy, and won a critics prize last year in London. It
played in New York in May.
   ``Hamlet is on the top 10 list of really good performances,''
Bergman said in a radio interview. ``It is the best I can do, which
means that I have reached quite far with it,''
   His next directing project will be Shakespeare's ``A Winter's
Tale,'' at Stockholm's 200-year-old Royal Dramatic Theater.
   Bergman was not always the cultural hero in Sweden that he is
today. His volcanic temper didn't help.
   ``He used to refer to anyone who didn't throw furniture around
as `inhibited,'' says Gunnel Lindblom, one of his leading ladies.
   In 1969 he was fined heavily for hitting a theater critic known
for his sharp reviews.
   ``And it was worth it,'' Bergman said.
   Today he says the critics don't bother him as much.
   ``I don't even get angry,'' he said in the radio interview. ``Of
course when you were young you took it very hard and were very
hurt. But not after 45 years.''
   Now, he says, ``everybody is very kind to me. ... I suppose it
is because I have become old and harmless.''
   His many love affairs, often with women starring in his films,
drew more attention in Sweden than his art. But his latest marriage
_ his fifth _ has lasted since the early 1970's.
   In his memoirs he regrets what he describes as his earlier
fickleness and attributes it to sexual obsession.
   ``There were very many years of my life when I was so occupied
with what I was doing that I forgot wives and children. Now since I
am older it has been very nice and rewarding to get to know my
children,'' he said.
   Bergman was Sweden's youngest theater director at 26 when he was
put in charge of the provincial Helsingborg City Theater in
southern Sweden. The theatrical tradition, he says, has always been
the real influence on his art.
   He is best known for directing more than 50 films, most of which
he wrote himself. He won three Oscars for best foreign films: ``The
Virgin Spring'' in 1960, ``Through a Glass Darkly'' in 1962 and
``Fanny and Alexander.''
   To mark the birthday, the Swedish Film Institute published a
special English-language edition of its magazine, Chaplin, paying
homage to the director who made his first film in 1944 and who
launched the careers of such international stars as Liv Ulmann,
Bibi Andersson and Max von Sydow.
   ``Bergman is probably the greatest film artist, all things
considered, since the invention of the motion-picture camera,''
wrote Woody Allen, one of a dozen international directors
contributing to the 90-page tribute.
   Sir Richard Attenborough, the British director, said Bergman
``extended the medium (of film) in a manner unequalled by any of
his contemporaries.''
   For some four decades Bergman divided his time between theater
and film, likening the two forums to ``my wife and my mistress.''
After ``Fanny and Alexander'' he said he was giving up his
``mistress'' and devoting himself to the stage. Since then he
produced only one Swedish television film in 1984, ``After the
Repetition.''
   ``Fanny and Alexander'' was a multi-levelled story of a
well-to-do family at the turn of the century, which appeared to
have traces of Bergman's own childhood with his clergyman father.
   The film marked Bergman's return to Sweden after six years in
self-imposed exile in West Germany. In 1976 he was hauled away by
police during a rehearsal and accused of tax violations. He was
cleared, but left the country in disgust.
   He is now back at the Royal Dramatic Theater, where he saw his
first play at the age of 12 and where he was the director from 1963
to 1966.

<HEAD>Pizza Empire Lets Monaghan Live Out Dreams of His Youth _ Adult
Style</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>

   His baseball team is beating up on the
New York Yankees, his classic car collection is growing, and his
quick-delivery pizza empire is pushing a billion dollars in annual
sales.
   To say that all is right in Thomas S. Monaghan's world these
days is a bit of an understatement.
   The 51-year-old Monaghan, listed by Forbes magazine as one of
the 400 richest Americans, is a man of many passions and the money
to pursue them _ thanks mainly to his pizza.
   Domino's Pizza Inc., billed as the world's largest pizza
delivery company, has grown from one Ypsilanti pizza store in 1960
to a 4,279-store operation with $883.8 million in revenues last
year.
   Monaghan's share of the operation, estimated by Forbes at about
$300 million, has given the one-time seminary student the dough to
live out several of his youthful fantasies:
   _He never became an architect, but the influence of his idol
Frank Lloyd Wright is apparent in the buildings at Domino's
300-acre headquarters complex.
   _He wanted to be a baseball shortstop when he was a kid. Now, he
owns a team, the Detroit Tigers, that was leading the American
League's East division at midseason and boasts the league's
All-Star shortstop _ Alan Trammell.
   _His devotion to architect Wright also extends to a collection
of classic cars, two of which were once owned by Wright. In
addition, Monaghan collects Wright-designed furniture, the crown
jewel of which is a dining table and chairs purchased for $1.6
million.
   _Monaghan is even starting his own subdivision on the outskirts
of Ann Arbor, with a Robert Trent Jones golf course and a
requirement that houses be designed by architects from a list of 30
drawn up for him by a panel of architectural experts.
   The first house _ for himself, wife Marjorie and their four
daughters _ will appropriately contain ``the very best of
everything,'' he says.
   ``No regrets,'' he said of his decision to pursue pizza over
architecture some 30 years ago. ``I think it's more fun being a
client, a patron. It's a hobby rather than a vocation.''
   Monaghan's success has allowed him to do _ and buy _ almost
anything. He reportedly spent $53 million to buy the Tigers in
1983, and his car collection includes an $8.1 million Bugatti
Royale among other gems.
   ``It was the best car in the world,'' he said. ``It was in the
Rose Bowl Parade with Gregory Peck riding in it.''
   Somehow he finds the time to keep expanding Domino's, the
nation's second-largest pizza company after Pizza Hut, and the
largest delivery operation.
   It all started when he and his brother, James, borrowed $500 to
buy the little Ypsilanti outfit. Still a freshman in college,
Thomas soon decided to quit school and traded a Volkswagen for his
brother's share of the business. The expansion began almost
immediately.
   Domino's opens about 50 stores a month in the United States and
eight foreign countries. Monaghan says sales are 7 percent ahead of
last year, and Domino's accounts for half the pizzas delivered in
the country.
   Despite the owner's fancy tastes, business at Domino's stays
pretty basic.
   ``It's the same old operation. Pizza only,'' Monaghan said.
   But there are innovations, such as ``mystery customers.'' The
company pays more than 8,000 people _ two per store _ to
anonymously buy a pizza a month and file detailed reports on the
pizzas and the delivery service, which is promised in 30 minutes
from the time the order is taken.
   Many stores offer $3 off if the pizza is late.
   With thousands of drivers delivering pizza to all kinds of areas
day and night, the business has its problems. The biggest is
security, followed closely by driver safety.
   The company has established a security force, based in its 13
regional offices, that pursues investigations when company stores
or drivers are robbed.
   Monaghan insists that speeding delivery drivers are not a
problem, contrary to some legal claims accusing them of causing
accidents. He said people tend to sue the company because of its
deep pockets.
   ``I found out when I first got in the business that driving over
the speed limit doesn't help you get the pizzas there any faster.
You're just stepping on the gas and putting on the brakes at the
next light,'' he said.
   Domino's has its challengers, such as companies promoting
hamburger delivery, but Monaghan has already tried and given up on
that idea.
   ``It's too small a ticket item, for one thing. And there's too
much variety. Every order's different. I just don't think you can
do it profitably,'' he said.
   Monaghan has learned many lessons the hard way. He grew up as a
foster child and was tossed out of seminary school in Grand Rapids
for bad behavior.
   ``They kicked me out of 10th grade. For mischievousness. They
told me I didn't have a vocation,'' he said.
   He later went to live with an aunt in Ann Arbor, graduated from
St. Thomas High School there, and enrolled briefly in Ferris State
College before leaving to join the Marines. After his time in the
service, he returned to Ann Arbor and enrolled in the University of
Michigan for a short time.
   His hard-knocks upbringing perhaps inspires some of the
straight-laced rules at Domino's, which in addition to cracking
down on the speed limit also requires male employees to keep their
hair cut above the collar.
   And Monaghan's religious roots still provide spiritual balance
for his own fast-lane approach to life. He was instrumental in
founding a growing international group of Catholic corporate chief
executives with at least 50 employees and $4 million in annual
sales.
   Legatus, Latin for ambassador, holds meetings that feature a
dinner, a speaker and a Mass.
   ``The purpose is to have the members be better Catholics and
more ethical business people,'' said Monaghan, hinting at the
strains of his considerable ambition.
   ``The businessman who has a sizeable organization and he's the
head of it, he has a lot of unique problems and a certain kind of
loneliness.''

<HEAD>Possibility of Woman Bishop Strains Anglican Communion</HEAD>

   Elevating a woman to the office of bishop in the
world-wide Anglican Communion would write a new page in Christian
history _ and it also could set off a religious storm.
   Both possibilities were in mind as Anglican bishops, including
those of the U.S. Episcopal Church, gathered for the opening
Saturday of their once-a-decade Lambeth Conference in Canterbury,
England.
   It is the global consultative forum for Anglican leaders, and
while it has no direct legislative powers, it has been strongly
influential for that international body of 70 million Christians.
   Among its 430 bishops from 28 regional and national branches,
including the U.S., there are no women, and none has ever been
brought into that male line traced back 2,000 years to the time of
the apostles.
   That historic succession also is maintained by Roman Catholicism
and Eastern Orthodoxy, which also reserve their priesthood to
males. Protestant churches with bishops do not claim that ancient
lineage.
   Several branches of the Anglican Communion now admit women to
the priesthood, and the prospect has arisen that they may soon,
somewhere, gain election as bishop.
   That has exacerbated an already tense issue.
   The Most Rev. Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury and
spiritual leader of the world-wide communion who will preside at
the three -week conference lasting to Aug. 7, has said:
   ``Until there is a decisive, ecumenical Christian answer to this
question, there will inevitably be the risk of broken, or at least
impaired communion between provinces of the (Anglican) communion.''
   Women have been admitted to the Anglican priesthood in nine
branches, including the United States, where there now are more
than 900 women Episcopal priests.
   Other branches ordaining women are Canada, New Zealand, Hong
Kong, Brazil, Kenya, Cuba, Uganda and Northern India. But they're
still barred from the priesthood in the other 19 branches,
including the ``mother'' Church of England.
   Consequently, women's ordination itself remains a divisive
issue, rejected in much of the communion, accepted elsewhere, but
the developing possibility of women bishops accentuated the
conflict.
   In several U.S. dioceses recently choosing new bishops, women
have been among the nominees, but haven't won election. If and when
it happens, U.S. bishops have said they would uphold it.
   But another, ominous sort of note has come from some other
bishops.
   In an ``Ash Wednesday'' manifesto last February, 54 Anglican
bishops, including four active bishops in the United States,
declared that ordaining women as bishops could wreck the Anglican
communion.
   A ``grave situation has already been created'' by ordination of
women in some parts of the church, preventing full mutual
recognition and causing some schisms, the statement said, adding:
   ``If women are ordained to the episcopate (as bishops) we do not
see how that can do other than call in question the continuance of
the Anglican Communion.''
   The manifesto, published in newspaper ads around the country
over the last six months, emphasized the historic tradition of a
male priesthood, and with the upcoming Lambeth Conference in mind,
said:
   ``Both for the preservation of a commonly accepted ministry in
thge Anglican Communion, and for the wider unity of the church, it
is essential that the introduction of any major innovation be in
accordance with the judgment of Scripture and have a clear
ecumenical consensus.''
   On the other side of the issue, 141 Anglican bishops issued a
``Pentecost Message'' last May, declaring:
   ``We believe that the ordination of women to all three orders of
bishop, priest and deacon is right.
   ``Men and women are created in the image of God and are baptized
into equal and full membership of the Body of Christ. The ordained
ministry should be a sign of this fundamental truth.''
   The statement says women's ordination is ``vital to the mission
of the church'' and ``a natural development for the church's
ministry.''
   While the Lambeth Conference lacks legisative power to lay down
the law on the matter, the status of women in the ministry was
expected to get major attention, with an attempt at some joint
policy about it.

   The social affairs arm of U.S. Roman
Catholicism says hunger is a ``moral disgrace in this rich nation''
and that church soup kitchens can't handle the problem.
   Monsignor Daniel F. Hoye, general secretary of the U.S. Catholic
Conference, backing proposed federal legislation to alleviate
hunger, said in a letter to all U.S. senators:
   ``Our dioceses and parishes are witnesses to the despair and
desperation of the many poor who cannot feed themselves or their
families.''
   He said churches had greatly increased food assistance, but such
efforts were insufficient and no substitute ``for a genuine
national commitment to end hunger.''

<HEAD>12 States Selecting Governors</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 4th graf about possibility of Dukakis leaving
ranks of governors.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETE BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are favored to seize control of governor's mansions in
Utah and Indiana and are in close contests with GOP incumbents in
North Carolina and West Virginia, as 12 states hold elections for
their top office this year.
   Taxes and the economy dominate the campaign agenda in many of
the states.
   Nationally, the gubernatorial lineup is 27 Democrats and 23
Republicans, the roster established April 4 when Democrat Rose
Mofford automatically became governor of Arizona upon the
impeachment conviction of Republican Evan Mecham.
   Incumbents will be on the ballot in nine of the 12 states, with
three of four Democrats and six of eight Republicans seeking
re-election. Republican Robert Orr of Indiana is barred from a
third term, and Democrat Ted Schwinden of Montana and Republican
John Sununu of New Hampshire are retiring.
   Another Democratic governor may leave office at the end of the
year _ Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, who is his party's likely
nominee for president. Should he win the election, he would be
succeeded by Democratic Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, who would serve
until his term expires in 1990.
   The other states holding gubernatorial elections are Delaware,
Missouri, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Washington and Vermont.
   The incumbent in most trouble is Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter
of Utah, whose bid for a second four-year term is in grave danger
despite a 2-to-1 GOP edge in registration. A recent poll had him
trailing Democrat Ted Wilson, former mayor of Salt Lake City, by 23
points.
   Bangerter's popularity plummeted after he prodded the
Legislature last year into passing a $166 million tax increase, the
biggest in Utah history.
   His problems have been deepened by the weak economy, the failure
of five savings institutions and the drought that made a mockery of
his decision to spend $60 million to pump floodwaters from the
Great Salt Lake.
   ``I believe it's winnable, but the governor has got to get his
case to the people, his record and what he's done. It's a good
case, but we may have passed the point in time where we could
salvage the election,'' said former GOP state chairman Charles
Akerlow.
   Another Republican in some jeopardy is Jim Martin of North
Carolina, only the second GOP governor in the state this century.
He is locked in a close and colorful race with Democratic Lt. Gov.
Bob Jordan.
   In a poll taken April 23-26 by Mason Dixon Opinion Research Inc.
and published by the Greensboro News & Record, Martin was favored
by 47 percent of the voters and Jordan by 39 percent with 14
percent undecided. But after the May 3 primary, a Charlotte
Observer poll taken May 18-26 showed Jordan supported by 47 percent
and Martin supported by 46 percent.
   Martin has accused Jordan of having a ``hidden agenda,'' citing
a Jordan speech in which he told black newspaper executives that he
agreed with them on some issues he would not discuss publicly for
fear of alienating ``rednecks.''
   At a debate last month, Martin told an audience he wanted their
votes ``regardless of your race, creed or the color of your neck.''
   Jordan, a businessman and four-term state senator, has labeled
Martin ``the sitting governor,'' with no comprehensive program.
Democratic leaders, playing on the theme, last year sent Martin a
seat cushion for Christmas.
   With Orr retiring in Indiana, Democratic Secretary of State Evan
Bayh is hoping to capitalize on his famous name to defeat GOP Lt.
Gov. John M. Mutz.
   Both campaigns said polls give the 32-year-old son of former
U.S. Sen. Birch E. Bayh a lead of nearly 10 points, but Bayh
predicted a tight race. ``Democrats win in Indiana _ if at all _ by
relatively small margins,'' he said.
   Mutz, who at 52 has almost 21 years of government experience,
has made Bayh's youth and relative inexperience a central issue.
   In West Virginia, Republican Arch Moore faces a stiff challenge
from insurance executive Gaston Caperton, a political novice who
spent more than $2 million, mostly his own money, to win a bitter
seven-way Democratic primary.
   The combative 65-year-old Moore is serving an unprecedented
third four-year term. He was governor from 1969 to '77. Democrats
outnumber Republicans 2-to-1.
   Coal, glass, oil, gas and steel, backbone industries in West
Virginia, are in a slump. The Legislature had to borrow $80 million
this year to keep the state afloat, and West Virginia has one of
the highest unemployment rates in the nation.
   At 48, Caperton advances himself as a new face with a
``business-oriented approach to government.''
   ``I think it's going to be very close,'' said Priscilla Haden,
Moore campaign chairman. ``We're in a Democratic state. I think
quite frankly the primary showed some definite anti-Arch Moore vote
out there.''
   Here is a brief look at the other races:
   DELAWARE: Republican Gov. Michael N. Castle faces lawyer and
environmentalist Jacob Kreshtool, a wry 69-year-old who in getting
the Democratic nod admitted he has not been an active party member,
has no money and no staff.
   MISSOURI: Republican Gov. John Ashcroft holds a commanding lead
in fund-raising and in the polls over state Rep. Betty Hearnes, the
likely Democratic nominee. Her husband, Warren Hearnes, was
governor from 1965 to '73. According tocampaign finance reports
filed in June, Ashcroft had raised $2.4 million to Mrs. Hearnes'
$321,000. Of Missourians contacted in one recent poll, 60 percent
favored Ashcroft and 29 percent Mrs. Hearnes.
   MONTANA: Democrat Thomas Judge is attempting a comeback in a
campaign focusing on how to ignite a boom in the state, which is
beset by a slump in the farm and energy sectors. Judge, governor
from 1973 to '81, faces Republican Stan Stephens, a 16-year member
of the state Senate. The early GOP favorite, Secretary of State Jim
Waltermire was killed in a plane crash two months before the
primary.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE: Democrat Paul McEachern, a lawyer and a fierce
opponent of the stalled Seabrook nuclear plant who nearly rode the
issue to the Statehouse against Sununu two years ago, is making
another bid. Judd Gregg, a four-term congressman whose father, Hugh
Gregg, was governor from 1953 to '55, is considered the clear
choice for the GOP nomination by many top Republicans.
   NORTH DAKOTA: Democratic Gov. George Sinner is heavily favored
to win a second term over real estate broker Leon Mallberg despite
a depressed economy and his advocacy of new taxes prompted by low
oil and commodity prices.
   RHODE ISLAND: Two-term Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete holds a
commanding lead against Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun, who lost to
DiPrete by a 2-to-1 margin in 1986. Sundlun, chairman of a company
that owns several TV and radio stations, has never held elective
office.
   VERMONT: Madeleine Kunin, the state's first woman governor, is
favored to win a third two-year term against House GOP leader
Michael Bernhardt, who accuses her of taxing and spending too much
and pursuing an agenda giving the state too much authority. Kunin
has been helped by a rosy state economy. Unemployment is at a
record low, while the state has just generated two record
surpluses, each $60 million, allowing her to earmark $20 million
for land conservation and $7.5 million for a dairy subsidy.
   WASHINGTON: Democratic Gov. Booth Gardner, a millionaire former
businessman, is strongly favored to win a second four-year term. He
has drawn no primary opposition and led his GOP challengers, Norm
Maleng, a prosecutor, and state Rep. Bob Williams, by at least 47
points in the latest poll.

   The dream of home ownership, which once
seemed almost a right to most Californians, is slipping ever
farther from first-time buyers as prices explode far beyond the
limits of the average pocketbook.
   The state's desirable climate and strong economy have long
pushed housing demand and prices ahead of the national average. But
nowadays, would-be home buyers are finding it difficult to come up
with even a down payment.
   Statistics show why: The median cost of a California home
reached $160,073 in May, nearly double the national median of
$88,600 and 13.4 percent higher than the median California home
price a year ago.
   Just 28 percent of the state's households could afford that
average-priced home in May, according to figures provided by the
California Association of Realtors. Nationally, 48 percent of
households can afford the median level home.
   ``We really want to be in a house this year, and we're going to
go into debt to our ears to do it,'' said Tim Dressendorfer, a
locksmith who once thought he and his wife could find a reasonable
starter home for $150,000 in the Long Beach area.
   After six months, they are still searching, and are now
considering taking out a variable-interest loan rather than a
fixed-rate mortgage so they can borrow more money.
   The latest state Realtors' figures show Orange County with the
highest median home price tag in the state, $202,760. The average
30-year mortgage with a 20-percent down payment on that house would
require monthly payments of $1,565, the trade group says.
   Even in affluent Orange County, only 22 percent of households
earn the $62,611 a year needed to qualify for such a mortgage.
   ``It's just so hard to save as much money as you need so your
payments aren't ridiculous,'' said Michelle St. John, 26, who rents
a home in Riverside with her husband, Judd.
   Many people sacrifice _ typically with a longer commute,
commonly two to four hours round trip in the Los Angeles area, to a
home in distant suburbs where prices are lower.
   The old option of asking Mom and Dad for help has been
supplemented these days by brokers who match investors with
potential home buyers who need a down payment. The young couple
live in the house and share the home title with their equity
partner, who shares any resale profits.
   Just how fast are prices rising? In recent months, buyers of
homes in desirable sections and suburbs of Los Angeles have found
themselves in bidding wars for their dream houses, paying far above
listed price.
   Carl McMahan, a 34-year-old downtown Los Angeles lawyer, put a
$349,000 bid on a home near Pasadena's Rose Bowl only to be outbid
at $369,000 _ $40,000 above the asking price. The home was on the
market only five hours.
   McMahan, who grew up in Fresno, joked: ``If I went to Fresno and
bought a home for $350,000 they would name a street after me.''
   Competition for homes is so fierce that customers frequently
camp out in front of sales offices at new developments, sleeping in
motorhomes and cars, sometimes for weeks, to be among the first in
line when sales open.
   When Pardee Construction Co. recently opened Phase 3 of its San
Remo tract in San Diego, 400 people were on the waiting list for 23
homes priced at $198,000 to $247,000.
   The state's slow-growth movement only adds to the dwindling
supply of homes, as the state's swelling population pushes along
demand.
   Many real estate brokers and economists warn that hard times for
first-time home buyers eventually will breed trouble throughout the
state's economy, as a generation matures without the security of
home ownership.
   ``The only weakness in the market is the entry level, and the
entry level is absolutely crucial to the marketplace and to the
long-term health of the state of California,'' said Joel Singer,
chief economist for the California Association of Realtors.
   ``I can't tell you how concerned we are about this,'' he said.
``It's a very tough battle.''
   ``You talk to any psychologist and he'll tell you people want
food, clothing and shelter,'' said Ira Gribin of Encino, incoming
president of the National Association of Realtors.
   Like many in the industry, Gribin believes the government should
subsidize housing.
   Help is being considered. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., is
working with Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., on a national housing
policy that would, among other provisions, allow money saved for a
home down payment to be tax deductible.
   In the California Legislature, Sen. Marian Bergeson has
introduced a bill that would award lucrative state grants to cities
whose plans encourage the building of affordable homes.
   A study of 61 metropolitan areas by the National Association of
Realtors found four California locations among the 10 most
expensive areas for home buying in the first three months of 1988.
   Behind Honolulu and New York came the northern Orange County
area of Santa Ana and Anaheim, ranking third with a median home
price of $183,380 for the first quarter, followed by San Francisco
with $178,800. Los Angeles was eighth at $159,900, San Diego ninth
with $134,400.
   The Riverside-San Bernardino area, considered affordable by
Ca parents, were Lincoln
County residents, but gave no further identification.
   Hospital officials declined to comment on whether the case might
be related to an attempted abduction Sunday of another baby born at
the hospital. But police said they suspected a connection between
the cases.
   In that case, a woman told state police that after she delivered
her baby she received a visit from a woman who told her she had
recently lost a newborn baby. The mother told state police the
woman showed up later at her home in Mingo County with a gift for
the baby.
   Once inside, police said, the woman was allowed to hold the
baby, then brandished a knife and threatened to take the infant.
State police said the intruder fled when another person walked into
the room.

   Toyota made some additions to its Camry line this
model year. But thank goodness the automaker didn't tamper with the
Camry's solid, quality feel.
   The test car, a 1988 Camry Deluxe V6 sedan, showed that even
with a new powerplant, the Camry preserves its admirable
reputation. In a 1987 survey by the California research firm J.D.
Power & Associates, the Camry was rated No. 1 in customer
satisfaction in its market segment.
   The survey was based on responses from owners of 1986 Camry
models. In addition, Motor Trend magazine gave the Camry high marks
last year, saying in part: What we loved best about the Camry was
the quality feel. Solid and well-engineered.
   Consumer Reports also rated the car highly. A survey showed
1984-86 models performed much better than average when comparing
repair reports. The magazine also noted the Camry has been one of
our top compacts for several years.
   That helps explain sales of 186,633 Camry cars last year, up 23
percent from 1986's 151,767. Toyota notes that 66 percent of U.S.
Camry buyers choose the car for its dependability.
   Company spokesman Edd Snyder said Toyota had no projections for
1988, but the automaker has built a plant in Georgetown, Ky., to
produce Camry cars. The first Kentucky Camry rolled off the line in
May. Regular production starts this summer, with 20,000 expected to
be built this calendar year. The plant's capacity, however, is
200,000 vehicles annually.
   Since their introduction in the 1983 model year, Camry models
have been imported from Japan. Buyers' median age is 43, with
median annual income of $48,000, the auto company says.
   Seventy-six percent of Camry buyers are married, 60 percent are
college graduates, and 58 percent are in managerial or other
professional occupations, according to Toyota, Japan's largest
carmaker.
   Fifty-one percent of the buyers are male.
   For 1988, Toyota has added an optional V6 engine as well as an
all-wheel-drive model. The lowest-priced Camry starts at about
$11,000 and has neither of those features.
   Toyota says among the Camry's major competitors is the Ford
Taurus, which also comes with an optional V6 engine and is priced
about the same as the Camry Deluxe V6 sedan ($15,000-$16,000), when
the same features are added in.
   Another competitor is the Honda Accord, which resembles the
Camry on the outside, except the Camry does not have retractable
headlights.
   The 1988 Camry Deluxe V6 sedan test car was comfortable, and
comforting. It was easy to slip into and drive off in _ there was
nothing really surprising.
   Instead, the ride just confirmed the Camry's reputation as a
solid, pleasant, all-around car. The dashboard gauges were large
and easy to read. The suspension was stable but also afforded a
cushioned ride.
   The engine, the first four-camshaft, 24-valve V6 mounted
transversely in a front-drive car, was superb, especially in
overdrive. A driver could turn on the overdrive with a button on
the gear selector and thereby boost fuel economy and get a
smoother, quiet ride.
   The test car had a four-speed automatic transmission. Cloth
upholstery was neatly styled. Fit and finish outside was just as
pleasing.
   The trunk was spacious, while the rear seats might be snug for
three full-sized adults. Leg room in the back was adequate if the
front seat was up nearly all the way and OK to cramped if the front
seat was back all the way.
   There was a pullout, two-cup holder below the front-seat ashtray
that was a thoughtful touch. The driver also could lock all the
doors and turn off the power windows with switches on the driver
door arm rest.
   The only part of the Camry that took some getting used to was
the automatic shoulder belt system. After a driver enters the car,
shuts the door and turns on the ignition, the front seat shoulder
belts automatically follow a track across the door and move to the
body. The belts allow free movement but retractors lock the belts
automatically in a sudden stop or impact. The belts also move back
away from the body when the door is opened.
   I got hung up in the belts a few times, until I got used to
them. My purse got hung up among the belts a few more times. And,
because of my size _ 5-feet-4 _ the belt rested annoyingly against
my neck. I pulled it down a bit to move it to a better position.
(And even with the automatic shoulder belts, front seat passengers
have to manually put on their lap belts.)
   Another problem in the Camry also may have to do with my size. I
moved the driver seat up a ways to comfortably reach the pedals.
But then the remote trunk release and fuel filler door release
buttons were nearly under the driver seat and difficult to reach.
Still, those are small complaints for an otherwise
well-thought-out, pleasant car that seemed easy to live with.

   Melody Thomas Scott says that in nine years
on CBS' ``The Young and the Restless'' her character has grown up
and undergone changes.
   ``When I began, Nikki was very poor, lower-class and troubled,''
she said. ``She's still troubled, but now she's rich.''
   Scott also grew up on the show. Three years ago she married the
executive producer, Edward Scott, and they are expecting their
first child at Thanksgiving.
   Although she was a teen-ager when she began the daytime serial,
she was already a veteran performer. She had worked with Clint
Eastwood twice as well as Kirk Douglas, John Wayne and Geraldine
Page.
   Her character, Nikki Reed Newman, has also packed a lot of
living into her years on ``The Young and the Restless.''
   ``She's gone through many marriages, many phases,'' said Scott.
``She's been a stripper, a model, a member of a cult and chased by
a psychotic killer. In my first story on the show my father tried
to rape me. I don't think that went over well with the audience. I
hit him over the head, he died and that was the end of that.
   ``Now I'm married to the Howard Hughes of Genoa City. It's not a
happy marriage. We had a storybook romance and wedding. My wedding
gown cost $25,000. It was wonderful for a while. We still live
together, but we live separate lives. Now that I'm pregnant I'm
hoping he will change his mind.''
   Her husband on the show is Victor Newman, played by Eric Braeden.
   ``I'm very happy with the show,'' said Scott. ``In my opinion
it's the best medium for an actress who wants to have a family. The
hours for a prime-time show are horrendous. I wouldn't want to be
running around the world on location. I usually don't go in until
noon. I'm usually through by 6 o'clock. It works out very good for
me.''
   Although the soap has about 25 regular characters, the main
storyline follows Nikki and her husband. The story began about 2{
years ago when ``The Young and the Restless'' began to challenge
ABC's ``General Hospital'' for the ratings leadership among the
daytime serials. In the current season, it is ranking first in the
Nielsen daytime ratings.
   Scott was born in Los Angeles and started her career at age 3 as
one of ``The Meglin Kiddies.'' Ethel Meglin, who recently died, had
started such other performers as Shirley Temple and Judy Garland.
The Meglin group put on musical performances around California.
   ``I was raised by my grandmother, who always talked about Jane
Withers,'' she said. ``She was one of my idols.'' Withers, probably
best known to current generations for her ``Josephine the Plumber''
commercials several years ago, was a major child star.
   Scott also appeared in commercials and did guest spots on such
shows as ``My Three Sons'' and ``Ironside.'' At 8, she played Tippi
Hedren's daughter in ``Marnie.'' She was a regular on ``The Tammy
Grimes Show.''
   ``I never thought much about doing the shows,'' she said. ``When
you're that young you don't think about it. I thought all kids did
it.''
   When she was in junior high school she read in a trade paper
that director Don Siegel was looking for ``a chubby little girl''
to appear with Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page in ``The
Beguiled.'' She stuffed herself to gain weight, then rented a Civil
War costume and auditioned for Siegel. She got the role, and later
when Siegel directed Eastwood in ``Dirty Harry'' he remembered her
and put her in the movie.
   She was also in ``Posse'' with Kirk Douglas and such TV movies
and miniseries as ``Studs Lonigan,'' ``Moviola'' and ``Secrets.''
She had a recurring role on ``The Waltons.''
   Scott appeared with John Wayne in his last movie, ``The
Shootist.''
   ``I played the sweet little girl in that,'' she said. ``I had a
scene with John Wayne on a streetcar. It was a thrill to do that.''
   She met her husband while doing ``The Young and the Restless.''
   ``He's been producer about 12 or 13 years,'' she said. ``For
many years we had just a working relationship. Then we became
friends and we got married three years ago.''
   She has a 5-year-old daughter, Alexandra, from an earlier
marriage, and her husband has a 15-year-old daughter, Jennifer.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson: Odds-Breaker, Dream-Maker, `I'll Never Surrender'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen years ago, a young, physically leaner,
spiritually meaner Jesse Louis Jackson told a black audience his
perception of a harsh truth. ``I would not run for president of the
United States,'' he said, ``because white people are incapable of
appreciating me.''
   It was a statement that spoke volumes, if not about the state of
race relations at the time, about the state of Jesse Jackson _ and
what drove this self-styled country preacher and prodigal
lieutenant of the late Martin Luther King Jr. to change his mind.
Now, even in defeat, he ranks as perhaps the most electrifying
presidential candidate since Robert F. Kennedy.
   Burning within him, by the account of relatives, childhood
friends, and not a few enemies, is a nearly lifelong fear of
rejection, and thus an obsessive urge to test his worthiness. Some
think it was borne only partly by the bitter shock of racial
bigotry in his native Greenville, S.C., and perhaps more profoundly
by his vivid memory of childhood taunts from white and black kids
alike: ``Jes-see ain't got no dad-dee, Jes-see ain't got no
dad-dee.''
   White America, Jackson acknowledges, has matured since he
uttered his cynical appraisal in 1973 of political and racial
reality. But so has Jesse Jackson, step by tentative, painful step,
from turtlenecks and bellbottoms to Christian Dior and pinstripes,
from street poetry in New York to delicate diplomacy in Syria, from
the embrace of Fidel Castro to the tearful cradling of a young,
quadriplegic girl who cheered him in an all-white community in
Oregon.
   Four years ago, as others still insisted that no black could win
the White House _ and especially not a black preacher with no prior
political experience, Jackson claimed, even in his most private,
candid moments, that he could. His formula was a ``Rainbow
Coalition'' of new black voters in the South, other minorities,
women of all races, white liberals, unemployed blue-collar workers
and depressed farmers.
   The rainbow never materialized, and in 1984 Jackson finished a
distant third behind Walter Mondale and Gary Hart for the
Democratic nomination, rarely pulling more than 3 percent of the
white vote in any state. Even so, it was the mst dramatic showing
by any black in the history of presidential politics, and all the
more remarkable in light of his own misadventures.
   He had his triumphs in that campaign, to be sure, not the least
his mushrooming success in leading young people, by the sheer power
of his oratory, from the temptation of drugs. He negotiated the
release from Syria of Navy Lt. Robert Goodman, shot down in a raid
over Lebanon. He enrolled upwards of 2 million new Democratic
voters, making the difference, by some accounts, in the party's
recapture of the Senate in 1986.
   But Jackson's campaign organization was a shambles, largely the
result of his scattershot, impulsive scheduling and his refusal to
delegate authority, raising questions about his ability to run a
government and rekindling criticism of the administrative
irregularities which marked his stewardship of earlier enterprises,
particularly Operation PUSH, his Chicago-based civil rights
organization.
   Worse, Jackson alienated party professionals by whining about
the delegate-selection rules, hinting, as he often has when
something goes against him, that they were designed to shut him out
because of race. He infuriated American's Jews by making a crack
about ``Hymies'' and ``Hymietown,'' and by his less-than-damning
response to the behavior of campaign supporter Louis Farrakhan, the
black Moslem leader who called Adolf Hitler ``wickedly great.''
Humbled by those mistakes, though slow to admit them publicly,
Jackson brought tears to the eyes of Democratic convention
delegates in San Francisco in the 1984 when he intoned:
   ``If in my low moments, in word, deed, or attitude, through some
error of temper, taste, or tone, I have caused anyone discomfort,
created pain, or revived someone's fears, that was not my truest
self ... I am not a perfect servant. I am a public servant doing my
best against the odds. As I develop and serve, be patient. God is
not finished with me yet.''
   He promised himself, and his campaign loyalists, that things
would be different this year, that he would be a positive force for
the party, that he would share authority with his staff and remain
on the ``high road'' of human tolerance.
   He has done all that, winning high marks from even his
staunchest opponents for grace on the campaign trail. The effort
was no more apparent than when Jackson refused to be drawn into a
bloodletting with New York Mayor Ed Koch, who endorsed Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee, and declared Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote
for Jackson.
   For all his determination to give the country a more mature,
less contentious candidate this time, Jackson himself had no idea,
until a bitterly cold night in remotest Iowa, just how different
things would be.
   It was the night of the 1987 Super Bowl, Giants versus the
Broncos. Jackson was unhappy. He figured everybody was settled in
for the game, so why was he being driven to Greenfield, 50 miles
southwest of Des Moines, in 15-degree weather, for a church
appearance that surely should never have been scheduled?
   On the edge of town, Jackson was dozing when the county sheriff
stopped the car and shined his flashlight into Jackson's face.
``They're here! They're here!'' the officer shouted. Jackson was
baffled. The officer pointed to the cars parked at the side of the
road, more than a mile from the church. An overflow crowd of 800
people, nearly all of them white, had turned out.
   It was a start of a new relationship with White America for
Jesse Jackson, one that took him from the coal-mining hollows of
Kentucky, to the coast of Maine, to the poolside chic of Beverly
Hills to Selma, Ala., where the mayor acknowledged that he stood on
the wrong side of the Edmund Pettus bridge on that bloody Sunday 23
years earlier and Jackson could agree that it was time ``to forgive
each other, redeem each other, and move on.''
   He would not sweep their votes, but he made new friends, reached
new understandings. He won half a dozen Southern primaries,
caucuses in Michigan and several other states, and finished a
respectable second in others, including lily-white Maine, Vermont
and Minnesota. Not enough to wrest the nomination from
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, but enough to make himself the
second strongest force to be reckoned with in the party, enough to
suggest, though not demand, that he be picked for the vice
presidency.
   With the presidential fight clearly over and the vice presidency
out of his grasp, Jackson still stood proud and defiant.
   ``I was born against the odds. I survived against the odds. ...
I'm an odds-breaker and a dream-maker and I will never surrender,''
he said.

<HEAD>WASHN: he said.</HEAD>

   Certainly he was the most exciting candidate, and the most
enigmatic. Here was a fellow who has never held public office,
running for president. Never served in the military, running for
president. A minister of the poor, preaching the life of Christ,
wearing designer suits, pocketing a six-figure income from
appearance fees, flying about in executive jets, staying at the
best hotels, missing vast amounts of time from family, yet
sactifying family life and values. An advocate of school busing and
federal aid to public schools, but who sent one son to one of the
most exclusive private schools in Washington. A street poet who,
depending on the audience, speaks ghetto, gospel or Ivy League.
   Like another powerful communicator, Ronald Reagan, Jackson
cloaks his ideas in anecdotes and aphorisms, and has no trouble
getting them on Page 1 or the 6 o'clock news. Some think there is
more entertainer than intellectual in his rhyme-and-mime wizardry,
but he has an inventive mind and quickly synthesizes facts and
figures. Then, he smiles, ``I've got to Jesse-ize it.''
   Thus, a pitch for universal health insurance and day care comes
out: ``Better day care and health care on the front side of life,
than jail care and welfare on the back side.''
   His agenda derives from three social movements _ civil rights,
peace and populism _ to which he adds, as a preacher, a strong dash
of moralism on the subject of drugs and self-responsibility. A
thousand times, probably more, he has brought audiences, black and
white, to their feet by thundering:
   ``Brown, black and white,
   ``We're all precious in God's sight.
   ``I AM Somebody!
   ``I AM Somebody!''
   The tone is one of moving on. He says the era of racial violence
has ended, that now it is time to end economic violence. And
poverty, he emphasizes, comes in all colors. To a group of
distressed white farmers in the South, he says, to a roar of
laughter and approval: ``My friends, when they foreclose on your
farm and turn the lights out, we all look amazingly alike in the
dark.''
   It was only four years ago that Jackson spun a different tune
when he told audiences about what it was like growing up black in
the South. ``Saturdays, I'd sell peanuts and soft drinks at the
stadium. Whites all around, drinking liquor. They'd say all kinds
of vulgar things, call me nigger, try to shortchange me ...
Couldn't go to the front at the movies, couldn't use the bathrooms.
It was humiliating.''
   And Jackson's ``comfort,'' or lack of it, with whites has long
been a source of concern with other black leaders, including his
mentor, Martin Luther King. Even after King quickly elevated the
bright young man who left theological school to join the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, he didn't want Jesse negotiating
for him with white leaders, giving that assignment instead to
Andrew Young, now mayor of Atlanta.
   To this day, other black leaders from the SCLC ranks regard
Jackson with some suspicion. King himself complained about
Jackson's ego, and at least once blew up over it in front of others.
   At the root, at least in part, of Jackson's problem with a
number of other black leaders is the curious story he repeated time
and again in the immediate wake of King's assassination, perceived
as an opportunistic and cynical attempt to leap over others to
claim King's mantel.
   After King was gunned down on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel
in Memphis in April 1968, Jackson told reporters waiting at the
hospital that he was the last man that King had talked to. Some
reporters said that Jackson also claimed he cradled the dying King
in his arms. That so incensed another King lieutenant, Hosea
Williams, that Williams physically attacked Jackson on the hospital
grounds. ``I just jumped on Jess ... because he was telling lies,''
Williams recalled in 1983.
   Making matters worse, Jackson left for Chicago the night of the
assassination, wearing a turtleneck shirt stained with blood. He
told television viewers the blood was King's. Moreover, he wore the
same shirt for two more days and repeated the story on network
interviews. According to Williams, Young, and Ralph David
Abernathy, the story just wasn't true. ``Jesse was not on the
balcony,'' said Young.
   Jackson now acknowledges he was not on the balcony, and denies
ever telling anyone differently. As for being the last person to
speak to King, Jackson says: ``I was. He was talking to me in the
courtyard.''
   The harsh view is that he was, and is, a charlatan in pastor's
robes, driven by ego, flitting from one brushfire to another only
long enough to get his face on the camera again. Even in high
school, his French teacher, Xanthene Norris, constantly lectured
him about being an ``I'' person. ``Always an `I' person. `I am
somebody,' that's Jesse,'' she said.
   At the Chicago Theological Seminary, Jackson nearly flunked
preaching, of all things, because he wouldn't bother to write out
his sermons in advance, as the course required. ``That's Jesse,''
said the Rev. Victor Obenhaus, a retired professor who was
Jackson's faculty adviser.
   But anyone who believes Jackson's sole interest is
self-aggrandizement likely hasn't spent much time with him. His
pace is simply too grueling, takes him to too many backwaters, too
many slums and through too many sleepless nights to be explained
away by ego alone. He has the trait for sickle cell anemia, yet
pushes himself to the point that he has been hospitalized at least
half a dozen times for exhaustion.
   So what drives Jesse Jackson? Some say it is a true, messianic
fervor for the poor, the minorities, the ``locked out.'' And some
say it is a long, underlying fear that he still isn't accepted.
``Being born out of wedlock bothered him disproportionatly to the
way it did anyone else we grew up with,'' said his half-brother,
Noah Robinson. ``Humiliation. That's the fuel that pushes Jesse.''
   Jackson says that's ``simplistic ... somebody else's romance of
my life.'' In an interview, he said the discovery, when he was 5 or
6 years old, that the father he was living with was not his natural
father was ``interesting, but it was not traumatic, because I was
never fatherless or an orphan.''
   Yet, when the adrenaline is running, when he is in his pulpit,
Jesse Jackson has let it pour out in different terms, to a
different audience:
   ``You are God's child. When I was in my mother's belly I had no
father to give me a name ... They called me bastard and rejected
me. You are somebody. You are God's child.''

<HEAD>Michael Dukakis: Cool, Cautious, No Shot in a Beer Kind of Guy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If ever there was a case of truth-in-advertising
by a political candidate, it may have been the television
commercial that Michael S. Dukakis aired briefly last spring.
   An Irish union leader, with a face that said he knew what he was
talking about, looked square into the camera and said Dukakis is
not your ``shot and a beer'' kind of guy.
   Don't expect a backslapper, the ad basically said.
   The commercial was a surprisingly frank attempt to meet head-on
the feeling of distance that many people get from this man who will
become the Democratic presidential nominee.
   No, Michael Dukakis, 54, the governor of Massachusetts, the
victor in a field of Democratic presidential contenders once
dismissed as the ``seven dwarfs,'' is not a chummy sort.
   Cold and aloof, his critics say, even stiff. A politician, some
believe, seemingly without zest for people, despite winning three
terms as governor. A student of the mechanics of government who
would rather talk about an alphabet soup of programs than evoke a
hearty laugh.
   One magazine called him ``a League of Women Voters' dream come
true, a walking, talking Boston Globe editorial.''
   Despite the critics, Dukakis succeeded in winning his party's
nomination, projecting a calm and pragmatic competence along with
his coolness, and an ability to lead by building consensus.
   ``The impression that comes across is not particularly warm,''
agrees his own pollster, Irwin ``Tubby'' Harrison. ``It's an able
one.
   ``I don't think it's easy for him to go out there and stick his
arm around everybody. But I can't either,'' he said. ``I don't
think it means you aren't a warm person.''
   It is unfair, perhaps, that any politician faces comparison with
Jesse Jackson as a campaigner. But it was inevitable that running
against him, Dukakis did.
   Where Jackson loved to play a crowd and move it to its feet,
Dukakis rarely raised his voice _ even let his voice trail off at
the end, his point sometimes escaping his audience.
   Jackson grabbed children in both arms and was rewarded with
smiles and kisses and pictures on the front page. Dukakis
approached children gingerly, addressing one on Nantucket Island
recently with a formal, ``Tell me who you are.''
   Dukakis' campaign style improved measurably as the nomination
became his. Still, he infrequently attempts jokes, and gets mixed
results when he does.
   ``He sort of cringes internally when he has to do that,'' said
longtime friend Richard Giesser.
   Aides say he strikes out one-liners they write into his speech
texts.
   Yet for all his limitations as a campaigner, Dukakis has led the
life of a consummate politician.
   He has dominated the politics of his old-money Boston suburb,
Brookline, for three decades. He has pursued politics
single-mindedly for all his adult life, seemingly pointing toward
this moment.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis' parents came to America from Greece in their youth,
their own parents drawn by the promise of jobs in New England
mills. The story of each is exceptional.
   Panos, his father, arrived at age 16. He mastered the language
and worked himself through college, then Harvard Medical School. He
was the first Greek immigrant to graduate from that school.
   Euterpe, his mother, arrived at age 9. Her father preceded her
and saved money to send for the family.
   A school principal, Stanley Gray, saw a special spark in the
young girl and became her mentor. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
Bates College in Maine, and became a teacher.
   She and Panos met briefly as youngsters, but it was not until
Panos had established a medical practice that they courted and
married.
   Dukakis' father died in 1979 after a long and successful general
practice in Brookline, Mass. He left trust funds amounting to more
than $1 million for Michael.
   The thought that a family can move in one generation from Ellis
Island to the White House is a powerful one. Dukakis invokes it
often on the stump, sometimes crediting the sacrifice and
accomplishments of his parents that gave him the opportunity.
   But his Greek connection was not a particular strength in
Irish-dominated Massachusetts, and Dukakis did not stress his
ethnic ties as a young politician.
   During his first term as governor he took a trip to his parents'
homeland that is often described now as a personal awakening. It
was well covered by reporters who noted he climbed the Acropolis in
his wingtip shoes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis was a studious achiever in high school in Brookline, a
community of affluent families with high expectations for their
children.
   He was on the tennis, cross-country and basketball teams, the
latter despite his slight, 5-foot, 8-inch size.
   An older brother, Stelian, encouraged Michael's athletic
endeavors. Stelian suffered a breakdown while in college in 1951
and led a disturbed life until a fatal accident in 1973. He was
struck by a hit-and-run driver while riding his bicycle.
   Dukakis got a taste of city politics while at Swarthmore College
in Philadelphia in the early 1950s, and by the time he was in
Harvard Law School, after an Army stint in Korea, had made up his
mind to make his career politics.
   At Harvard, Dukakis made a friendship that has endured with Paul
P. Brountas, also the son of Greek immigrants and now his campaign
chairman.
   After taking their bar exams, the two hopped in Brountas'
Karmann Ghia and drove to the West Coast, stopping in Los Angeles
for the 1960 Democratic convention where they saw John F. Kennedy,
also from Brookline, claim his party's nomination.
   In a mostly straight-laced upbringing, this trip has provided
some of the few colorful annecdotes of Dukakis' youth.
   Together they stopped in Las Vegas, where Dukakis only
reluctantly agreed to try the slot machines and won a $30 jackpot
on his first try. He quit after that win, Brountas recalls.
   ``I said, `aren't you going to play any more?''' Brountas said.
``He said no. That's when I knew he'd be successful in politics _
you've got to have luck as well as skill.''
   They traveled to Mexico, hanging out around the pool of a fancy
Acapulco hotel while staying in $2 a night digs elsewhere.
   That budget-conscious streak survives. Dukakis buys his suits at
a Boston department store, Filene's, and boasts of it.
   Katherine ``Kitty'' Dickson was a few years behind him at
Brookline High School, and they did not date until after Dukakis
had begun work in a Boston law firm and was running for a state
House seat. They were married in 1963.
   Kitty had been married previously, and had a young son, John,
now 30. John took the Dukakis name, though he was never legally
adopted. Two more children, Andrea and Kara, were born in 1965 and
1968.

   Dukakis is called ``Mike'' in his ads. But those close to him
always use the more formal ``Michael,'' including his wife.
   On their trip, he and Brountas talked about what they wanted to
do next, and hatched plans for a political reform movement.
   ``He didn't want to practice law _ it wasn't his goal in life,''
Brountas said. ``He wanted to go into politics.''
   Dukakis created the reform group, and in 1962 was elected to the
state House himself.
   He lost a bid for lieutenant governor in 1970. He gained
television experience as moderator of a public television show, The
Advocates, in the interim, and in 1974 ran for governor.
   He won, ousting the Republican incumbent, Francis Sargent.
   In that campaign Dukakis made the remark that later hanged him
politically: a ``lead pipe guarantee'' not to raise taxes.
   Once in office he found the size of Massachusetts' financial
problem was staggering, and the state bordered on insolvency.
Reluctantly, he agreed to both budget cuts and tax increases.
   Beyond the taxes, his first term was characterized by political
clumsiness. His Mr. Clean image faded into one of arrogance in
pursuit of reform.
   Campaign workers found themselves unable to get state jobs.
Allies turned on him and legislators were alienated. Nobody thought
he listened.
   ``He never sought any massaging from other politicians, and
therefore thought that it wasn't necessary to massage them,''
Brountas said.
   His unpolitical style, the taxes, a lackluster re-election
campaign _ it all combined for a 1978 primary loss to Edward King.
   Dukakis was stunned.
   Friends say he learned from the loss _ including how to listen.
He spent the next years in exile at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.
   ``I think it was an absolutely critical event in his life,''
says Francis X. Meaney, a Boston lawyer who was a close ally of
Dukakis until a falling out a dozen years ago. ``He learned, yes,
you've got to march at the head of the army, but you've got to make
sure the army is behind you.''
   Dukakis sought a rematch in 1982 and won, aided by King's
political stumbles.
   He waved aside talk of a presidential bid until he won
re-election in 1986. Vindication, in his own mind, could come only
by winning that which he had lost before: a second consecutive term.
   ``I don't think he'd be running for president today if he hadn't
lost,'' Brountas said.
   ``What happened is, he became an excellent politician,'' says
Brountas. ``He was not a good politician'' before.

   The Dukakis in private is a lot like the Dukakis you see in
public, friends say. He values privacy, but is comfortable with
life in the public eye. He always reserves the dinner hour for his
family when he is in Boston.
   ``Sunday was always paramount, family day,'' he said in an
interview. ``I make the pancakes about 10 o'clock. It's one day a
week we are together.''
   He likes to walk in the evening, carrying hand weights. Often he
collars top aide Nick Mitropolous to join him.
   He refused Secret Service protection until after the New York
primary, and even with the bodyguards has slipped off at night to
do grocery shopping at the neighborhood Stop and Shop.

<TEXT>
   After an arduous primary campaign, Dukakis has emerged atop a
remarkably united Democratic Party, in part through his ability to
avoid the pitfalls of special interest politics.
   Yet he arrives at the nomination with many questions about him
unanswered. Polls show an uncertainty over whether he is liberal or
moderate, and his own image largely undefined.
   Critics attribute this to vagueness. In fact, listening to
Dukakis can leave one wondering just how he intends to do what he
says. A favorite line that he never fails to invoke is a call for
``good jobs at good wages _ and I mean good wages.''
   ``He engages in what I think is Dukakis-speak,'' said Michael J.
Robinson, a political scientist at Georgetown University. ``People
are going to be talking about how incredibly bromidic he is.''
   Whether he can keep his support as people begin to pay more
attention to him remains open to question.
   He has stressed creation of economic opportunity in the mold of
Massachusetts, but without making clear how that will work in
Mississippi or Montana.
   Rather than specifics, what Dukakis is selling is an impression
of competence and consensus-building, of good management, of having
the right priorities and, hey, we'll work out the details.
   In fact, Dukakis sometimes sounds much like many other governors
of the 1980s, who stress economic development, high technology and
consensus politics, and who often sound alike regardless of party
affiliation.
   Thus this man first elected as a liberal reformer in what some
regard as the most liberal of states, a dues-paying member of the
American Civil Liberties Union, even tries on occasion to present
himself as a conservative.
   ``I was always taught that conservatives paid their bills,''
Dukakis said. ``In that sense I guess I'm conservative.''
   His biggest applause lines come when he puts aside vague talk of
private-public partnerships and programs, and hones in on the
Reagan adminstration for mishandling the economy, the war on drugs,
or supporting Panama's strongman Manuel Noriega.
   His crowds are always receptive and polite, but it is when he
goes before Greek audiences _ and sometimes other ethnic groups _
that he evokes real emotion.
   At Astoria, a heavily Greek section of Queens, in New York,
thousands of Greeks filled the streets and crushed frighteningly
around him.
   At a Greek Orthodox Church in Los Angeles, hundreds cheered him
wildly, and Dukakis responded by joining in a traditional Greek
dance.
   At a crumbling Cuban and Puerto Rican community hall in the
South Bronx of New York, the crowd sang and danced rhythmically to
a Salsa band that sang, ``Mike Du-ka-kis, el presidente.''
   To the Greeks he speaks in Greek, to the Hispanics he speaks
Spanish. To them, clearly, he represents more than a political
candidate.
   ``You can articulate a vision of the future, and where the
country's going, or you can symbolize it,'' says Gov. Bill Clinton
of Arkansas, an admirer of Dukakis.
   ``You can argue that he doesn't articulate it. But I believe he
symbolizes it.''

   N.H.L. Devisinghe's small rice paddy is
180 miles from the battlefields where the Sri Lankan government is
fighting Tamil rebels, but he a war victim nevertheless.
   He has lost his son and his mud and thatched home has been
burned down.
   In Sri Lanka's south, where the 60-year-old rice farmer lives, a
radical movement has sprung up among the country's majority
Sinhalese to counter government efforts to finally make peace with
the minority Tamils in the north.
   Sri Lanka, the island formerly known as Ceylon off southern
India, now faces two bloody insurgencies in place of the one that
began in ethnic conflict five years ago.
   As in the Tamil struggle for independence in the north, the
victims in the south are often poor villagers like Devisinghe.
   Sinhalese guerrillas came to his door in this tiny village 15
miles inland from the coastal town of Tangalle in June and accused
his son of being a government spy.
   They set fire to the hut. Later, the headless body of his son,
30-year-old Gunasena, was found in a field nearby.
   ``The JVP did it,'' Devisinghe said in a whisper. ``The JVP.''
   The JVP is the Janata Vimukti Peramuna, or Peoples Liberation
Front, which has been accused of slaying more than 350 people in
the past year.
   The Marxist front, all but destroyed by government forces after
an abortive coup attempt in 1971, is regrouping in the south by
appealing to Sinhalese nationalism.
   Under the slogan ``Save our Motherland,'' the JVP has recruited
students and the rural poor to launch a bloody campaign against
President Junius R. Jayewardene and his United National Party.
   Its victims have included the party's president and general
secretary as well as simple villagers. Jayewardene himself narrowly
escaped assassination in a grenade attack in Parliament last August.
   The government has sent several thousand troops south to try to
end the insurgency.
   ``Neither we nor, in the end, the people will tolerate their
violence,'' said Lalith Athulathmudali, Sri Lanka's national
security minister.
   Ironically, it is Jayewardene's strategy for making peace with
the Tamils in the north that got him in trouble in the south.
   On July 29, 1987, Jayewardene signed an accord with Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India to end the Tamil insurgency.
   India, whose own Tamil minority of 60 million is sympathetic to
the Sri Lankan revolt, had been accused of supplying guns to the
rebels. Its role under the peace pact is to guarantee the fighters
give up their arms.
   In exchange, Sri Lanka is to give the Tamils limited autonomy in
their traditional northern territories while preserving the
national unity that the majority Sinhalese demand.
   But the largest Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, has rejected the settlement, and India has sent more
than 50,000 soldiers to the island to help put down the Tigers'
rebellion.
   Sporadic clashes with the Tigers persist, but an Indian diplomat
said a final settlement appeared close.
   ``The Tigers are now virtually destroyed as a military force,''
said the diplomat, who insisted on anonymity. ``It is just a
question of time before they agree to return to the political
mainstream.''
   Both Tamils and Sinhalese are skeptical, however, that the
Indian-enforced peace plan will end the bloodshed.
   The Tigers have never given up their call for an independent
homeland to protect the Tamil language and culture.
   A chasm of distrust between the two ethnic communities also has
been created by the long, bloody conflict.
   The Tamil uprising began July 23, 1983, with a rebel raid that
killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers and a week of revenge rioting by
Sinhalese that left at least 1,000 Tamils dead.
   The attacks and counterattacks that followed wiped out entire
villages of Tamil peasants and Sinhalese settlers in the north and
east. More than 8,000 people have died.
   S. Selvarajah, a Tamil whose stationery store in Colombo, the
capital, was burned down in the 1983 riots, says he fears the
Indian plan cannot protect his people.
   ``How can we trust anymore?'' he asked. ``We do not feel safe.
We worry it could happen again.''
   In the southern coastal town of Matara, Sinhalese lawyer Mahinda
Wijesekera has doubts, too.
   ``Regardless of what they say, the Indians are trying to divide
our island, and people will rise up against that,'' he said.
   The tension between the two communities arises from differences
in race, religion and language that have simmered for centuries on
this lush island of coconut palms, tea and spices.
   The Sinhalese are descended from Indian Aryans who colonized Sri
Lanka more than 2,500 years ago. They are Buddhists who make up
about 75 percent of the 16 million population and dominate the
government.
   Darker-skinned Dravidians invaded later, also from India, and
overcame the Sinhalese to found a kingdom in the island's north.
Their Tamil descendants, mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the
island's people.
   Through 400 years of Portuguese, Dutch and British rule, the two
peoples each spoke their native tongues.
   But in 1956, eight years after independence from Britain, the
government declared Sinhala the island's official language.
Protests by the Tamil-speaking minority were put down with force.
   Mohammed Ashraf, a Moslem lawyer from the northeast, dates much
of the current troubles to the language law.
   ``The polarization started then and hasn't stopped,'' he said.
   It has spread to the 1-million-member Moslem community, too. The
Moslems, descended from early Arab traders, are lobbying for their
own ethnic district.
   When the Indian-brokered settlement goes into effect, the Tamils
will elect a local council in the north and be given authority over
education, law enforcement and development.
   Neelan Tiruchelvam, a moderate Tamil politician, says the accord
establishes ``a basic framework for Sri Lankan society to remain
united.''
   The pact, he says, recognizes that the island is a pluralistic
society, not a Sinhalese-Buddhist domain.
   But the JVP contends the accord really gives the Tamils what
they wanted _ a homeland.
   Its posters and pamphlets call on Sinhalese to unite against the
plan and threaten to kill those who support it.
   The group's undeground leader is Rohana Wijeweera, 45, a
graduate of Moscow's Patrice Lumumba University. Through
clandestine indoctrination classes and cassette tapes, he
emphasizes reclaiming the country for the Sinhalese majority.
   Western diplomats said Wijeweera has about 500 armed followers,
some believed to be army deserters, and perhaps as many as 10,000
sympathizers.
   The JVP has been accused of robbing banks and hijacking payrolls
to fund its operations.
   During the rice harvest in April, JVP supporters went
door-to-door in the south collecting rice ``taxes'' based on the
size of each family's field.
   ``Some gave willingly,'' said Wilbert Weerasekera, a Wetiya
farmer. ``Some were unwilling, but they also gave.''
   Many southern schools have been closed by JVP-backed boycotts,
and school walls are covered with anti-government slogans.
   Black paint scrawled on the stucco walls of the deserted school
in Tangalle hints of a long struggle.
   ``First we must save our motherland,'' it says. ``Then we will
go to school.''

   Here are some facts and figures on Sri Lanka
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ The island of 25,000 square miles, about the size of
West Virginia, is situated 20 miles off India's southern coast.
Coconut palms fringe its beaches, and inland plantations grow tea
and spices for xport. Arab traders called it Serendib, from which
the word serendipity comes. To Dutch and British colonialists, it
was Ceylon. But the government officially changed its name in 1972
to Sri Lanka, which means ``bountiful island'' in the Sinhala
language.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Portuguese, in search of spices, conquered coastal
areas in 1505. They were followed by the Dutch in 1678. The British
took over in 1796 and eventually subdued the central Kandyan
kingdom. The British granted independence Feb. 4, 1948.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PEOPLE _ The major ethnic groups are Sinhalese, who make up
about 75 percent of the 16 million population, and Tamils, who make
up 18 percent. The Sinhalese are mainly Buddhists and the Tamils,
Hindu. Others are Moslem descendants of early Arab traders,
Christian ``burghers'' descended from Portuguese and Dutch
colonialists, and immigrant Malays.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Before the start of the ethnic war in 1983, Sri Lanka
was a model Third World developing country. It's economy grew an
average of 7 percent a year, and tea exports and tourism were
mainstays. Economic growth last year fell to less than 1.5 percent,
and tourism has dropped to a fraction of the 250,000 people who
visited annually in pre-war years. Per capita income is about $380
a year.

<HEAD>Mask Carving Survives as Village Art in Troubled Sri Lanka</HEAD>

   A leering demon with protruding
tusks shares wall space in the museum here with snake-bedecked evil
spirits who spread diseases and benevolently smiling ones who
provide the cures.
   The brightly painted masks, carved according to closely guarded
family patterns, are the products of a lively Sri Lankan cottage
industry with roots in ancient times and today survives the
nation's ethnic conflicts.
   Few tourists come to Sri Lanka without carrying away at least
one of the traditional masks, but sales are off sharply these days
because of the government's war with Tamil guerrillas in the north.
   Many masks decorate Sri Lankan homes. Museums in Colombo, the
capital 50 miles north of here, and scattered southern villages
preserve others for public viewing.
   In this coastal town, the Wijesooriya clan has produced master
mask carvers for six generations.
   Cataracts on both eyes prevent Ariyapala Wijesooriya, the
88-year-old patriarch of the family, from wielding mallet and
chisel any longer.
   But his son, Bandusena, 48, and grandson, Rakmal, 12, continue
the carving tradition.
   ``Our masks are not just for show,'' says Bandusena. ``From
ancient times until now, they are used in our festivals, in our
traditional dances and for healing.''
   Pandula Endagama, an anthropologist at the Colombo Museum, says
references to mask dancers appear in Sinhalese literature of more
than 2,300 years ago.
   Today, he said, the master carvers are concentrated in
Ambalangoda, the town of Matara on the southern coast and the town
Horana in the west.
   Curative dances are still performed, including in the cities,
Endagama said. Demons representing diseases ranging from fevers to
coughs and blindness are brought in, appeased by the family of the
ill person with ritual offerings and then driven away.
   ``Colonial powers tried to suppress the tradition, but it
survived,'' Endagama said. ``There is probably a scientific basis,
maybe a psychological one, for it, but no one has worked to find
out what it is.''
   The masks of Ambalangoda and elsewhere are made from the local
kaduru tree, which grows along rivers and on the edges of Sri
Lanka's ubiquitous rice paddy fields.
   The better masks are seasoned near a villager's kitchen fire for
three months or more before they are painted, usually with enamel.
   Inexpensive masks can be found for $5 or less. The Wijesooriya
family's famous 18-demon mask, which wards off 18 different
sicknesses represented by a series of tiny evil faces, sells for
more than $100s.
   Bandusena Wijesooriya says sales to tourists have fallen off by
more than 80 percent since war broke out in the north of Sri Lanka
five years ago and frightened many visitors away.
   But he and his 25 carvers maintain their business with sales to
museums, mainly in Europe, and to foreign collectors. He also runs
a school to keep the ancient mask dancing art alive.
   ``So, too, I hope will my son and his son and his son,''
Bandusena said.

<HEAD>What Farmers Need Is Some Plain, Old ``Normal'' Weather</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's an old story about the western Kansas
farmer who claimed he had ``some of that 70-mile-an-hour wheat''
and it looked pretty good, despite a hard winter, spring drought
and grasshoppers.
   Of course, the farmer meant that if you drove by the field at a
fast clip the wheat didn't look all that bad.
   In much of the nation today, drought-damaged fields don't look
good at any speed. Even in places that recently had heavy rain,
stunted corn won't produce grain or even decent forage.
   The Agriculture Department will issue another crop report on
Aug. 11 based on information from on-site field surveys. It will
include per-acre yield estimates and total production figures for
the major crops, including wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, hay and
sorghum.
   Last week, in a special July edition, the USDA ``projected''
1988 production figures for a number of the major crops in the wake
of the drought.
   The projections were made to reflect conditions as of July 12,
the same day the report was issued, and were said by officials to
be ``highly tentative.''
   Over the last seven years, the average difference, or error
rate, between July crop projections and final production has been:
wheat, 1.9 percent; rice, 5.1 percent; corn, 12.4 percent; sorghum,
15.4 percent; oats, 10.5 percent; soybeans, 6.6 percent; and
cotton, 10.8 percent.
   ``For corn, the July projection has been below final production
in four years and above in three,'' the report said. ``The average
difference is 743 million bushels, ranging from an underestimate of
1.1 billion bushels in 1981 to an overestimate of 2 billion bushels
for 1983, the last major drought year.''
   The July 12 projections indicated the corn crop at 5.2 billion
bushels, down 29 percent from pre-drought expectations, and 26
percent less than harvested in 1987. Soybeans, projected at 1.65
billion bushels, were down 12 percent from before the drought and
13 percent below 1987 output.
   A number of state and private experts said the USDA numbers were
too high, that crop losses are greater than the projections
indicated.
   Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department's top
economist, told a meeting of the U.S. Agriculture Communicators'
Congress that the report represented ``the best information
existing today'' on the crop situation.
   Wilson also explained that the projections were ``based on the
assumption of normal weather from here on out'' during the the
remainder of the 1988 crop growing season.
   The projected corn output of 5.2 billion bushels this fall, down
from 7.06 billion harvested last year, would be one of the biggest
year-to-year declines on record. In 1983, drought and a huge
federal acreage-idling program designed to trim grain surpluses,
resulted in corn production of 4.17 billion bushels, down from a
record then of 8.24 billion in 1982.
   Wilson said red meat and poultry production this year is
expected to be a record 59.9 billion pounds, up nearly 3 percent
from 1987.
   ``High feed prices and lack of forage have forced some producers
to sell breeding stock, adding to meat supplies,'' he said. ``The
dairy sector also has been affected by the drought.''
   Although Wilson cited the relatively large stockpiles of wheat
and corn as buffers against shortages in 1988-89, prices are
climbing and will add to the cost of producing meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   The projections showed that corn prices could rise to an average
of $2.45 to $2.85 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing year that
will begin Sept. 1, compared with $1.65 to $2 expected before the
drought. Corn prices in 1987-88 are forecast at an average of $1.90
to $2 per bushel.
   Wilson said pastures and livestock ranges as of July 1 were
rated 46 percent of ideal, the worst for mid-year since records
began in 1921.
   ``We expect that farmers will harvest 63 million acres of hay
this year, compared with 61 million in 1987,'' he said. ``This
acreage figure includes hay cut from the area approved for haying
and grazing on land idled by annual commodity programs and land in
the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.''
   However, the projections did not include an estimate of 1988 hay
production. That will be included for the first time in the Aug. 11
report.

   The nation's drought-battered corn crop may
produce 5.2 billion bushels this year, 29 percent less than
expected a few months ago and 26 percent below last year's harvest,
the Agriculture Department estimates.
   Sharp reductions also are expected in 1988 wheat and soybean
production, the department said Tuesday.
   Until drought and extreme heat heigthened in May and June, USDA
had projected this year's corn harvest at 7.3 billion bushels, up
from last year's output of 7.06 billion.

   Chrysler Corp. has matched the new, skimpier
incentive offerings of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. by
trimming back rebates on many models.
   Chrysler, the smallest of the Big Three U.S. automakers, has
been running incentive campaigns that have no expiration dates. But
two weeks ago, it announced its current campaign would expire
Tuesday.
   Industry analysts said at the time that Chrysler was signalling
to its two rivals a willingness to reduce the size of rebates and
was giving them a chance to introduce lesser incentives. Ford and
GM subsequently did so.

found evidence of corrosion in several of their Boeing 737
jetliners years before the April 28 accident in which the top of an
Aloha jet ripped off over Hawaii.
   In one case, a 7{-inch crack was found on a sister ship in the
same section of fuselage that ripped away in April, leaving a large
gaping hole above passengers' heads.
   Henry Arii, Aloha's vice president for quality control and
engineering, said Tuesday the crack was discovered during a routine
inspection. Aloha officials blamed the crack on corrosion and said
it was promptly repaired.

   The number of Americans changing residences
dipped after the 1984-85 burst of home sales triggered by falling
interest rates, the Census Bureau reports.
   Some 3 million fewer Americans moved between 1985-86 than in the
previous year, with virtually all of the drop occurring in the
category of moves within the same county, according to the
geographical mobility report released Tuesday by the bureau.
   Lower interest rates unleashed a pent-up demand for new homes in
the 1984-85 year, spurring the mobility rate to 20.2 percent,
highest in this decade, the bureau said.

   Eastern Airlines management was unimpressed with a
four-year contract offer from its pilots, who claim they are
offering $51.5 million a year in cost savings to the airline, an
Eastern spokesman says.
   ``The arithmetic they (the pilots) used totally distorts the
proposal,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Tuesday. ``The main
point (is) they've hit us with a proposal that would increase our
costs.''
   He said Eastern's calculations have found the pilots' proposal
would increase the airline's costs by $116 million a year.

   The next administration should push for new
gains in energy efficiency, and without sacrifice for conscientious
consumers, an advocacy group says.
   Such a goal should incorporate an auto fuel-economy requirement
of 45 miles per gallon, a 50-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase
and a high ``gas-guzzler'' tax to be rebated to buyers of fuel
efficient cars, said Tuesday the American Council for an
Energy-Efficient Economy.
   A related report was issued by the Safe Energy Communications
Council arguing that nuclear power has had virtually no effect in
holding down oil use ``and cannot have any substantial impact in
the foreseeable future.''

<HEAD>Dow Jones Average Closes Below 2,100; U.S. Corn Forecast Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers' fears about the impact of the drought have been
confirmed by a government report, while Wall Street's concern about
inflation and higher interest rates has pushed stock prices lower.
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the nation's
drought-battered corn crop may produce 5.2 billion bushels this
year, 29 percent less than expected a few months ago and 26 percent
below last year's harvest.
   Sharp reductions also are expected in 1988 wheat and soybean
production, the department said.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
18.67 points to 2,092.64, its first close below 2,100 in three
weeks.
   A rebound in corn and soybean futures prices in advance of the
crop report and a jump in gold prices renewed inflation fears. That
hurt bond prices and drove interest rates higher, and the weakness
in the bond market carried over to stocks, analysts said. The yield
on the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped to 9.13
percent from 9.06 percent late Monday.
   Crude oil prices weakened further in volatile trading, but
unleaded gasoline strengthened because of tight supplies and
speculation about higher U.S. demand.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August delivery price
of West Texas Intermediate, which fell sharply on Monday to a
20-month low, ended 6 cents lower t $14.72 a barrel.
   Until drought and extreme heat heightened in May and June, the
USDA had projected this year's corn harvest _ based on yield trends
and an assumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion bushels, up
from last year's output of 7.06 billion.
   Corn is the largest and most important U.S. grain crop. As a
livestock feed it is the major building block for beef, pork,
poultry and dairy products. Along with wheat, soybeans and other
commodities, corn also is vital as an export, desired by many
countries wanting to upgrade their livestock programs.
   The new figures were based on updated projections that take the
drought into account and reflect conditions as of Tuesday.
   Soybean prospects were shown at 1.65 billion bushels, down from
about 1.9 billion in 1987. Until the drought, the 1988 harvest had
been expected to be around 1.88 billion bushels.

   Unleaded gasoline prices have strengthened
because of tight supplies and speculation about higher U.S. demand,
but crude oil has weakened to a new 20-month low.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August delivery price
of West Texas Intermediate, which fell sharply on Monday to the
lowest point since late 1986, ended 6 cents lower at $14.72 a
barrel on Tuesday.
   The last time prices for the near month contract were lower was
Nov. 3, 1986, when prices closed at $14.71 a barrel.
   At one point during trading Tuesday, crude oil contracts were as
much as 40 cents a barrel lower than Monday's close before
rebounding then falling again.
   Oil traders attributed the erratic market to nervousness about
excessive supplies and fear that Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries production will continue outpacing demand, the
same fears that caused prices to tumble on Monday.
   However, wholesale unleaded gasoline prices jumped 1.35 cents a
gallon to 53.48 cents, recovering losses of a day earlier. Traders
said they bid up prices on unleaded gasoline because of the
high-demand summer driving season and forecasts that U.S.
consumption would continue rising.
   Wholesale No. 2 heating oil, the other widely followed refined
product traded on the mercantile exchange, fell 0.68 cent a gallon
to 40.65 cents.

   With oil prices falling toward the lowest point
in nearly two years, speculation has grown that influential Arab
OPEC producers are flooding the market for political motives that
include crushing Iran's diehard war effort and preserving
Republican power in the White House.
   Some industry analysts believe Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates have decided privately that cheap oil is one
of their most effective and plentiful weapons to achieve these
aims, despite the enormous revenue losses they could endure.
   Together, these oil-rich Persian Gulf members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries represent a
staggering force that could easily inundate the fragile world
energy markets with millions of excess barrels.
   For Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and most
powerful OPEC member, driving prices down could help achieve the
multiple aim of seizing a greater market share and bankrupting
Moslem-world adversary Iran, which relies heavily on oil sales to
finance its protracted Persian Gulf war against Iraq.
   ``The Saudis are simply determined to basically starve the money
flowing into the region as a means of ending the war,'' said
Stephen Smith, a petroleum analyst with Bear Stearns Cos. in New
York. ``The Saudis have deeper pockets than Iran. They're just
getting awfully tired of the risks in the region.''
   Moreover, some analysts reason, the Saudis and their Arab allies
want George Bush to inherit the U.S. presidency from Ronald Reagan,
because of the Republican-led commitment to protect Persian Gulf
shipping, as well as fear that a Democratic administration would
reverse that policy.
   By depressing oil prices, they can artificially restrain
American inflation and trade deficit figures, helping preserve
Republican claims of a healthy U.S. economy and blunting Democratic
criticism.
   For example, a 10 percent decline in crude oil prices means a 1
percent drop in the U.S. inflation rate, according to some economic
reckonings. Crude prices already have fallen nearly 22 percent in
the last two months, which could substantially reduce the
government's pre-election inflation figures.
   Perhaps more important, cheap oil can shave the market-jolting
monthly merchandise trade figures that have become such a
politically sensitive issue for the Republicans.
   With the United States importing 7 million barrels of oil a day
at prices of between $14 and $15 a barrel, that represents a
monthly bill of between $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion. If crude
prices fall to a two-year low of $10 a barrel, as some analysts
predict, the savings would be considerable.
   While some market strategists say this argument is far-fetched,
others say it is increasingly mentioned as a possible reason for
the most recent declines in prices, well below OPEC's target price
of $18.
   ``Political analysts have told me it is a potentially motivating
factor,'' said Morris Greenberg, an energy expert at the Wefa
Group, a forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``Apparently, the
leadership in those countries would find it in their interest to
have continuity in the political situation here.''
   For one thing, Greenberg said, Gulf Arab regimes favor stability
in general. Secondly, he said, ``they look upon a new
administration as taking a certain amount of time to get up to
speed on the issues. Clearly, Bush has far more experience.''
   Still, some say the main reason that the Saudis and their allies
want to depress prices is economic. Cheaper oil discourages
exploration by non-OPEC producers and gives the cartel greater
power to raise prices in the future.
   ``To maintain solidarity and cohesiveness in OPEC, they have to
move toward that $18 number,'' said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``So I would say in terms of
priorities, the rumor that they are keeping prices down to elect
Bush is interesting but far down on the list.''
   Others said Saudi strategy probably has nothing to do with U.S.
politics. They believe oil prices will rise rapidly once Iran is
driven by economic desperation to make peace, as some predict it
will do by year-end.
   ``I think the Saudis now feel they have Iran on the ropes,''
said George Gaspar, oil analyst at the Milwaukee investment firm of
Robert W. Baird & Co. ``After a cease-fire and negotiations, the
Saudi position will shift. They'll be looking for higher prices to
accommodate Iran and other OPEC countries.''

<HEAD>Analysts: Trimmer Incentives Mean No Year-End Leftover Bargains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The smaller-than-usual rebates being offered
recently by the Big Three automakers probably signal that auto
buyers are unlikely to get many year-end bargains on 1988 models,
analysts say.
   Because the automakers have been paring their previously bloated
inventories of unsold vehicles, buyers may have trouble finding
dealers willing to slash prices to clear out 1988 cars at the end
of the model year.
   The latest incentive package announced Tuesday by Chrysler Corp.
has no expiration date, but General Motors Corp.'s current campaign
ends Sept. 28 and Ford Motor Co.'s ends Oct. 5 _ after the normal
August-September clearouts.
   By then, dealers probably will have few 1988 models left and GM,
Ford and Chrysler will have shipped thousands of new 1989 models to
showrooms. The 1988 model year ends Sept. 30.
   Furthermore, rebates included in the automaker's latest
incentives have been reduced a bit from earlier amounts for many
models.
   ``Consumers looking to get a good buy on an 1988 model in the
third or fourth week of September are going to be out of luck,''
said Chris Cedergren, analyst with J.D. Power and Associates in
Agoura Hills, Calif.
   But the smaller rebates don't necessarily mean manufacturers are
backing away from incentives entirely, analysts said.
   ``June was the best June in (sales) history. There's a testing
of the marketplace going on to see whether you can make a little
more money'' while sales are strong and inventories are low, said
Ronald Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San
Francisco.
   Industry car inventories were 13 percent lower at the end of
June than a year earlier, at a 56-day supply, according to Ward's
Automotive Reports. An inventort supply of 60-65 days is considered
normal.
   Rebates and heavily discounted loan financing rates are
extremely costly for automakers. But industry analysts and
executives at all Big Three companies and many foreign makers have
said they see little chance of ending the practice.
   ``It's just an attempt to make more money while demand is
strong,'' Glantz said. ``The only way to get rid of incentives is
if all the companies did it at once, and Chrysler is clearly
committed to incentives.''
   Incentive offerings have shrunk substantially since 1986, when
GM launched a round of rebates and low financing rates as a way of
clearing bulging inventories. Since then, GM and other makers have
learned to better match production to sales, reducing inventories
and the likelihood of year-end fire sales.
   But rebates and low loan rates will continue, and Cedergren
predicted manufacturers will be forced to return to more generous
incentives to sell their new 1989 models.
   Coupled with a low inventory of 1988 models, the early end of
1988 production means dealers may run out of old models. But at a
time that Cedergren expects sales to begin slowing, dealers will
have far more new models than in past years.
   The slowdown will be worsened by lack of sales to
bargain-hunters who usually flock to dealerships in early fall, he
said.
   In announcing its new rebates on Tuesday, Chrysler matched the
new, smaller offerings of its two larger rivals. Like Ford,
Chrysler's package includes scaled-down rebates ranging from $300
to $1,000.
   For example, rebates were trimmed to $300 from $400 on
Aries-Reliant; to $300 from $500 on Jeep Comanche; to $400 from
$500 on Dodge Daytona; to $500 from $750 on Dodge and Plymouth Colt
Vista; to $600 from $750 on Eagle Premier LX and ES.
   Chrysler also added several models to its incentive program,
such as the Plymouth Horizon-Dodge Omni, Chrysler LeBaron sedan and
wagon, 1989 Eagle Medallion, Plymouth Caravelle-Dodge 600, and Jeep
Grand Wagoneer.
   It increased rebates on Chrysler LeBaron GTS and Dodge Lancer to
$1,000 from $750. Dropped from the incentive campaign were its
standard vans and wagons and Jeep Wagoneer.
   Ford on Monday trimmed rebates on three of its strongest-selling
models: Mustang with 2.3-liter engine and manual transmission, to
$500 from $750; Ford Taurus-Mercury Sable, to $500 from $600; and
Ford Tempo-Mercury Topaz, to $400 from $500.
   GM earlier this month announced similar changes.

<HEAD>Polaroid Announces Employee Cutbacks, New Film Distribution Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Instant photography pioneer Polaroid
Corp. plans to begin worldwide distribution of conventional color
film as part of a reorganization that analysts say stems from
takeover rumors and shareholder pressure.
   The plan announced Tuesday also includes the reduction by up to
8 percent of Polaroid's domestic work force, an employee stock
ownership plan intended to acquire about 14 percent of the
company's outstanding common shares and a $300 million stock
buyback.
   ``What they are doing is very close to the type of action an
acquirer would take,'' said Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``They are cutting back on
workers, focusing more on core business and cutting back on
(research and development) and riskier projects.''
   Officials at Polaroid would not provide details about the
production or distribution of the new line of 35mm, 126 and 110
film, which have been available in Spain and Portugal for about two
years.
   Polaroid spokesman Sam Yanes said the company has not released
sales figures for the film, which will compete against industry
leaders Eastman Kodak Co., Agfa-Gevaert and Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.
   Glazer said the conventional film project eliminates many of the
uncertainties linked to new products by using Polaroid's
established distribution network.
   Polaroid stock closed up $1.50 to $31.25 a share Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   The restructuring moves, estimated to save the company about $70
million annually, are in apparent response to pressure from
shareholders to increase profitability and refocus on the $7
billion annual conventional film business in the face of declining
instant photography sales.
   ``We have the worldwide name recognition, quality franchise,
global distribution system and outstanding marketing capabilities
that have enabled us to maintain our leadership position,'' I.
MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's president and chief executive, said
in a news release.
   ``...We have designed this comprehensive plan of action to
capitalize on those strengths while maximizing our internal
efficiencies, which we believe will dramatically improve our
profitability in 1989 and beyond,'' Booth stated.
   The cuts of 500 to 800 employees are planned to be completed by
January through early retirement or severance programs. A company
statement said employees could receive up to one year's salary
through the severance plan.
   The Polaroid work force has dropped from about 20,000 to 13,000
since 1978, said Yanes. About 10,000 of the present employees are
based in Massachusetts.
   Pay for the remaining workers will be reduced 5 percent to 10
percent under a employee stock ownership plan designed to purchase
about 10 million shares the company issued last year. All employees
will be required to participate in the program, with 10 percent of
top-level executives' salary being converted into stock while the
lowest-paid workers will receive stock without a cut in take-home
pay, said Yanes.
   No timetable or minimum price was announced for the $300 million
stock repurchase plan.
   Polaroid and Kodak are scheduled to appear in U.S. District
Court in Boston on Jan. 9 to begin the damage award trial in
Polaroid's $5.7 billion patent infringement suit against Kodak.
   Polaroid claims that Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak violated
Polaroid patents on instant photography and film from 1976 to 1986.
Kodak has called the claim unreasonably inflated.

<HEAD>Toymaker Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new management team is in place
today at Coleco Industries Inc., and the company that brought
Cabbage Patch Kids to the marketplace is seeking protection from
its creditors in bankruptcy court.
   The West Hartford-based company on Tuesday gave up a months-long
battle to reach an agreement to reorganize its debts with its banks
and bondholders, announcing it had filed for federal bankruptcy
court protection from creditors.
   Coleco said it filed for Chapter 11 protection late Monday with
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The
filing will permit the company to continue operating while it
reorganizes its finances.
   The Coleco board appointed J. Brian Clarke, currently president
and chief operating officer, as president and chief executive
officer.
   Clarke replaces Morton E. Handel, who is recovering from
open-heart surgery. Handel submitted his resignation as chief
executive officer because of the company's need for a full-time CEO
during this period. He will continue as chairman of the board.
   The Chapter 11 filing had been expected ever since Coleco
announced in March it suffered a $105.4 million loss for all of
1987 and would miss an April interest payment on its debentures.
Coleco said the filing did not include the company's Canadian and
other foreign subsidiaries.
   Telephone calls seeking comment from company officials on
Tuesday were not returned.
   Coleco owes more than $100 million to a group of foreign and
domestic lenders. In March, shortly after it announced a $47.4
million loss for the first quarter, the toymaker proposed a $335
million debt restructuring plan.
   But late last month, Coleco was forced to abandon the plan
because it failed to win approval of the company's debtholders. The
company said Tuesday it was no longer able to obtain working
capital financing because of the failed plan and because some
creditors had started to attach its assets.
   Over the past year, the toymaker slashed its work force in an
effort to cut costs. It currently has fewer than 600 employees in
the United States, down from an average of 2,500 last year.
   It also has sold several of its product lines to raise cash.
   ``What is going to emerge is going will be very different from
what went in,'' said analyst David Leibowitz, senior vice president
of American Securities Corp.
   Five years ago, Coleco was on top of the toy world with its
Cabbage Patch Kids. The company sold $1 billion worth of the dolls
over two years.
   The Cabbage Patch craze prompted Coleco to expand its product
lines and make acquisitions. Coleco bought the company that makes
Scrabble board games, acquired the license to the popular Trivial
Pursuit board game and bought the company that makes Wrinkles
stuffed animals.
   But the Cabbage Patch fad abated and analysts said the company
did not pare its costs soon enough. When the toy industry slumped
in 1987, Coleco was hit particularly hard.
   The company suffered losses in four of the past five years,
including $215 million over the last two years.
   It recently lost the license to market Trivial Pursuit because
of its precarious financial state.
   But Coleco said Tuesday it managed to retain the license for the
valuable Cabbage Patch line. Coleco said it had extended its
license with Original Appalachian Artworks Inc. until Dec. 31, 1994.

<HEAD>Edelman Group Reduces Stake in Payless Cashways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor group led by New York
financier Asher B. Edelman has reduced its stake in Payless
Cashways Inc., leading analysts to speculate that the group may
abandon efforts to acquire the building materials retailer.
   The group sold about 500,000 Payless shares Friday, reducing its
holding from 8.1 percent to 6.3 percent, according to documents
filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
group, which now owns about 2.1 million shares, remains the
company's largest shareholder.
   The group, directed by Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest
Inc. of Kansas City, did not disclose why more shares had been
sold. Perry Sutherland, a member of the group, declined to comment
on what the investors planned to do with their remaining shares.
   Analysts said the stock sale seemed to clear the way for a group
of Payless senior managers to buy the company for $27 a share, or
$909 million. Their bid, announced June 30, requires shareholder
approval.
   Payless became the subject of takeover rumors more than three
months ago when its stock soared in heavy trading. In May, the
Edelman-Sutherland group disclosed it had a large stake in Payless
and said that it might try to acquire the company. The group later
increased its position to 9.9 percent.
   Since then, the group periodically has sold Payless shares.
Moreover, the group has not made an offer for Payless, and recently
the investors stopped commenting publicly on what they planned to
do.
   Sutherland Lumber is a competitor of Payless and is also based
in Kansas City.
   Payless stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, fell
Tuesday to $26.75, down 37{ cents a share.
   Analysts said that because the Edelman-Sutherland group had been
selling Payless shares since late May, it appeared unlikely that
that group or anyone else would make a competing offer.
   ``I'd say the chances of another offer is about the same as the
(management) deal not going through,'' said Richard Pyle, an
analyst who follows Payless at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. in
Minneapolis.
   Payless has 200 stores in 26 states and has about 15,000
employees. It has 10 stores in the Kansas City area, where it
employs 1,400 people.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has discovered that 1987
Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari vans with 4.3-liter engines and
overdrive transmissions might spew exhaust that smells like rotten
eggs.
   GM has issued a service bulletin to dealers with instructions on
how to fix the problem. Among the recommendations is replacement of
the on-board computer that monitors the fuel mix in the engine.
   The computer is only used in vans with the overdrive
transmission.
   An improper fuel mix results in the buildup of a sulfur and
hydrogen, causing the rotten egg smel.
   GM spokesman Dee Allen of the Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada
Group said heavy use of the vans can cause the problem.
   The problem does not affect all 4.3-liter GM engines, such as
those installed in pickup trucks, Allen said.
   There were fewer than 72,000 1987-model Chevy Astro vans and GMC
Safari vans sold, the newspaper said. The problem was fixed in 1988
vans, the technician said.

<HEAD>Indefinite Layoffs Planned At GM's Doraville Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DORAVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will lay off about
800 hourly workers at its Doraville production plant for an
indefinite period beginning Friday, company officials say.
   The plant will be closing for a month to make a model change.
When the suburban Atlanta facility reopens Aug. 16, only about
4,100 of the plant's 4,900 hourly workers will return to work, said
George J. Simms, the plant's personnel director.
   The plant will be staffed then for production of 50 cars an
hour, according to Simms. Since November, it has been staffed with
enough workers to make 75 an hour, although that production has
been frozen at 50 per hour, or 800 a day, since May 31.
   The Doraville plant is being equipped to make the 1989
Oldsmobile Cutlass.
   Almost all of the plant's production workers will be laid off
temporarily during the model change, Simms said. Those who do not
return next month will be eligible for jobs in training and other
non-production areas.
   Neither Simms nor Jerry J. Hall, president of the United Auto
Workers Local 10, could say how long the indefinite layoffs might
last.
   Hall said he hoped many of the laid-off workers would be
recalled by August 1989, when the plant begins building a four-door
version of the Cutlass. Currently, the plant makes a two-door model.
   Hall said he did not believe that GM froze production at
Doraville because of poor Cutlass sales. Cutlass sales reportedly
are on the increase after a slow start.
   Doraville is GM's sole facility for the Cutlass.

<HEAD>New Assertions Against Asian Businessman in Insider Trading Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says an Asian investor it has
implicated in a major insider trading case attempted to spirit
millions of dollars out of the country in defiance of a court order.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen slapped a new injunction
Tuesday on Taiwanese businessman Fred C. Lee, but denied a
Securities and Exchange Commission's request to hold him in
contempt for trying to transfer the money overseas earlier this
month.
   Lee, 38, was accused by the SEC last month of making $19 million
in stock profits by illegally trading on inside information he
allegedly bought from Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., 24, a rookie
analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co.
   The SEC got a temporary restraining order at the time, freezing
the assets of both men. It has demanded the pair return the $19
million plus triple damages for a total of $76 million, the
second-largest insider trading case since the record $100 million
Ivan Boesky scandal broke nearly two years ago.
   In court filings this week, the SEC also provided new details
about the case, asserting Lee maintained contact with several young
analysts and tried unsuccessfully to recruit one at First Boston
Co. to join his alleged scheme.
   The filings further asserted that Lee talked with Wang at least
once daily by telephone and traded through dozens of accounts in
other names, including one in the name of Lee's Zen Buddhist priest.
   Sworn statements by six of Wang's colleagues contained in the
SEC filings indicated he was intimately familiar with much of their
work and sometimes may have pumped them for information.
   In the court proceeding Tuesday, the SEC claimed Lee had
attempted to withdraw ``several million dollars'' from accounts he
has at Standard Chartered Bank in lower Manhattan.
   Lee was accused of sending a letter through his Hong Kong lawyer
to Standard Charter's Hong Kong branch last week in an attempt to
transfer the funds.
   Owen granted the government's request for the preliminary
injunction, but did not find Lee in contempt of court, as the SEC
had requested. He also extended for two weeks the temporary order
freezing Wang's assets.
   Lee, who maintains residences in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the
United States, has indicated through his lawyer, Michael Perlis, he
would fight the SEC accusations. Wang's attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin,
has not divulged how his client would respond.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Surge Their Limits On Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices soared their
daily limits at the opening today on the Chicago Board of Trade in
reaction to a government report showing severe drought damage to
those crops.
   In a special report issued Tuesday afternoon, the Agriculture
Department estimated this year's corn production would fall more
than 26 percent below last year to a 5-year low, based on current
crop conditions. The USDA said soybean production probably would
decline by at least 14 percent from last year's 1.9 billion bushels.
   Many analysts had called the estimates conservative and were
expecting a less dramatic reaction from traders.
   ``I guess their enthusiasm picked up after they had a chance to
sleep on it,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with the
trading firm G.H. Miller & Co.
   Forecasts for a dry weekend in the Corn Belt followed by a
return to 100-degree temperatures gave prices an additional boost,
he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 6 cents to 8} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.90 a bushel; corn was 3{ cents
to the limit 10 cents higher with the limitless July contract up 16
cents at $3.22 a bushel; oats were up the 10-cent limit across the
board except for the limitless July contract, which was up 15 cents
at $2.94 a bushel; soybeans were locked up the 30-cent limit with
limitless July contract up 38{ cents at $9.18 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .65 cent lower to .23 cent higher with August
at 65.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to .82 cent
lower with August at 74.97 cents a pound; hogs were .62 cent lower
to .68 cent higher with July at 45.05 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were .15 cent to 1.90 cents higher with July at 35
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Tuesday while pork futures were
mostly higher.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
confirmed today that the central bank has undertaken a series of
steps to tighten credit in recent months and said the Fed was ready
to push interest rates even higher to dampen inflationary pressures.
   Greenspan warned of growing signs of price pressures stemming
from such factors as the severe drought, tight labor markets and
high industry operating rates.
   ``The costs to our economy and society of allowing a more
intense inflationary process to become entrenched are serious,''
Greenspan said in testimony today before the Senate Banking
Committee.
   ``As the experience of the last two decades has clearly shown,
accelerating wages and prices would have to be countered later by
quite restrictive policies, with unavoidably adverse implications
for production and employment,'' Greenspan said.
   That comment was an obvious reference to the severe 1981-82
recession brought on by Greenspan's predecessor, former Fed
Chairman Paul Volcker, as a way to fight the double-digit inflation
that plagued the country at the beginning of the decade.
   Greenspan gave no indication that the central bank was planning
anything close to the tight-money policies pursued by Volcker. But
Greenspan said that the Fed did intend to err on the side of
tighter credit conditions rather than worrying that Fed policy
could be too restrictive and thus harm long-run growth prospects.
   ``The long-run costs of a return to higher inflation and the
risks of this occurring under current circumstances are
sufficiently great that Federal Reserve policy at this juncture
might be well advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness
rather than stimulus,'' he said.
   Greenspan's comments came in his mid-year report to Congress on
the central bank's conduct of monetary policy and its economic
outlook.
   The remarks were not considered a surprise. Financial markets
have been expecting another slight tightening of credit conditions
in coming weeks because of continuing evidence that the U.S.
economy is growing rapidly. The latest such information came
Friday, when the government reported that the jobless rate fell to
a 14-year-low of 5.3 percent in June.
   The tightening process has pushed a variety of interest rates,
including mortgage rates, higher in recent months. Banks raised
their prime lending rate, which serves as a benchmark for many
consumer loans, to 9 percent in May and many economists are
expecting another one-half percentage point increase in the prime
rate.
   Immediately following the Oct. 19 collapse of the stock market,
the Fed began an aggressive credit-easing process to insure that
the market turmoil would not topple the country into a recession.
   When Greenspan last appeared before Congress in February to
discuss monetary policy, he said that the central bank was still
easing credit conditions. He said then that he believed the dangers
of a recession or higher inflation were about equal.
   But in today's report, Greenspan put the emphasis on fighting
inflation. He confirmed that the Fed had taken a ``succession of
restraining steps from late March through late June.'' Those moves
have pushed short-term interest rates up by one full percentage
point. Greenspan said the moves were taken because the Fed was
``well aware that it should not fall behind'' in resisting
inflationary pressures.
   In the mid-year report, Greenspan said the Fed was boosting
slightly its forecast for economic growth this year, saying it was
looking for the gross national product to expand at an annual rate
of between 2.75 percent to 3 percent. In February, the Fed had a
lower GNP growth forecast of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent.
   The Fed said it was leaving its targets for monetary growth
unchanged for 1988 but narrowing the growth ranges in 1989. The
target for one measure of the money supply, known as M-2, was
shrunk to an increase of 3 percent to 7 percent, instead of the
growth of 4 percent to 8 percent being sought in 1988.
   Greenspan, sounding very much like Volcker, warned that it was
absolutely essential that Congress make more progress in reducing
the huge federal budget deficits. He said such a cut would be the
single most important thing government could do to reduce the
country's huge foreign borrowing needs.
   Greenspan said the deficit reduction targets established in the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law were a good start, but he urged
Congress to go even further and aim ultimately for budget surpluses
sometime in the 1990s.
   The country is enjoying a peacetime record of 67 continuous
months of economic growth, but some economists have expressed
concerns that if the Fed tightens credit too much, the country
could enter a recession next year.
   Most of the economic downturns the country has suffered since
World War II have come from Fed actions to raise interest rates in
an effort to head off inflation.
   Prominent economists testifying before the Senate Banking
Committee on Tuesday disagreed over whether inflation now
represents a threat to the economy.
   Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, said that unless Congress and the new administration
move to get control of the huge federal budget deficits, the Fed
will have no choice but to push the country into a recession to
cool an overheating economy.
   ``Inflation now is becoming too high and too firmly ingrained
for the Fed to ignore,'' Dornbusch said. ``The longer the Fed waits
in initiating a fight against inflation, the more massive the
recession that needs to be created to beat inflation back down to
the comfortable levels of the mid-1980s.''
   However, Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton Universtiy,
said he sees no signs that inflation is threatening to heat up
despite the low unemployment rate and high operating rates in many
industries.
   ``The Fed must not be swayed by the inflation hysteria that
seems to sweep Wall Street about every two weeks,'' he said. ``The
Fed must ignore this insanity.''

   Airlines' Tough Security Policies Spawn Cottage Industry
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The airlines have been getting tough on air
piracy _ with some outside help.
   The rise in international terrorism in recent years and the
heightened threat of hijacking has spawned a cottage industry of
security companies providing passenger screening and other services
under contract with the airlines.
   Security in the air has taken on a new sense of urgency in
recent days, following the shooting down of an Iran Air jetliner by
a U.S. Navy warship in the Persian Gulf. The nation's big airlines
that fly overseas aren't taking any chances on a retaliatory
hijacking and have beefed up their already tight security measures.
   Although the big carriers have their own security divisions,
their mounting work loads have prompted them to call on outside
companies for help in stemming the rise in air violence.
   Airline security ``is an undertaking of great magnitude; it's a
difficult assignment,'' said Dick Lally, assistant vice president
for security at the Air Transport Association, a Washington-based
trade group that represents the nation's major carriers.
   Since the federal government mandated ``100 percent'' screening
of airline passengers at the beginning of 1973, Lally noted, the
major airlines have stepped up their security and refined their
techniques and equipment. Many carriers have security standards
tougher than the government's.
   Each year, U.S. airline and contract security agents uncover and
seize 3,000 to 4,000 firearms and make around 1,500 related
arrests, according to the air transport group. The metal detectors
and X-ray equipment used in the screening are already into their
fourth generation.
   It has become more efficient and cost-effective in many cases
for airlines to farm out security work, rather than training more
of their own staff to handle it. In departure gate areas shared by
several airlines, it makes sense for a common passenger checkpoint
to be located in the concourse leading to a gate area, instead of
each airline having its own security setup at every gate.
   One of the airlines using the gate area usually assumes
responsibility for the concourse checkpoint, contracting with an
outside security company and splitting the costs of the contract
with the other airlines in that section.
   The ``granddaddy'' of security companies whose clients include
airlines is Wackenhut Corp., which works for nearly all the major
U.S. carriers.
   Wackenhut has a high profile. Last February, armed guards from
the company were mobilized at Kennedy International Airport in New
York by beleaguered Pan Am Corp., after Teamsters union leaders
vowed ``guerrilla warfare'' against the airline in a wage dispute.
   ``We do get called by companies if there's labor unrest,'' said
Patrick Cannan, a spokesman for Wackenhut at its headquarters in
Coral Gables, Fla.
   Beefy Wackenhut guards also were in evidence at giant Texas Air
Corp.'s annual shareholders meeting last month in New York. Frank
Lorenzo, Texas Air's chairman, threatened publicly several times to
have the guards eject angry shareholders if they persisted in
asking him questions after he had requested they stop.
   Wackenhut, a publicly owned company, has 28,000 full-time
employees and is well-known nationally. But the handful of other
security firms catering to airlines _ Globe Security Systems Inc.,
J.J. Security Inc. and Ogden Allied Services Corp. _ are either
privately held or subsidiaries of other companies.
   Some of the big U.S. airlines that carry passengers overseas
also hire local security firms in foreign nations.
   In this country, many of the bigger, better-known security
companies had unhappy experiences and got out of airline work,
leaving the field to the smaller firms.
   ``That (airline security) was a segment of business we weren't
interested in participating in any longer,'' said Joe Allen, a
spokesman for Baker Industries Inc., parent of both Wells Fargo and
Burns International Security Services.
   The two security subsidiaries stopped doing airline work about
two or three years ago, Allen said, mainly because of liability
problems that could result from hijackings being blamed on
inadequate security provided by the companies.
   Allen explained that the decision to get out of airline security
work was accelerated by litigation arising from the crash of an Air
India jumbo jet in June 1985. Burns, which provided the passenger
screening for the flight, was named as a defendant by families of
the victims in a case still in the courts. The crash off the coast
of Ireland, which killed all 329 people aboard, was blamed on a
bomb planted by Sikh terrorists.
   CPP-Pinkerton's, another security giant, has shied away from
airline work for the past four to five years.
   Wackenhut's Cannan conceded that liability for poor security can
be a problem. He stressed, however, that each security contract
with the airlines is different and many of them provide for joint
liability.
   The airlines are sensitive about security. Many of them admit
that they hire outside contractors but refuse to discuss any
details or to disclose how much they spend on security.
   Four of the nation's airlines _ Pan Am, TWA, American and
Northwest _ levy a special security charge of $5 per ticket.
   Pan Am, like TWA, is one of the most security-conscious U.S.
airlines. In addition to its internal security division and
contracts with Wackenhut, Pan Am's World Services subsidiary sells
security, maintenance and other services to government agencies and
other airlines.

   The stock market put together a modest gain

declined.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.67 on Tuesday,
rose 5.87 to 2,098.51 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in the overall count

556 unchanged.

   Greenspan said the Fed took several steps to restrain the
economy in recent months with the aim of keeping inflation in check.
   By implication, brokers said, Greenspan seemed to be suggesting
that no further credit-tightening might be needed in the near

<HEAD>Warner Says It Will Contest Chris-Craft Suit to Delay Lorimar
Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. says it will
vigorously defend itself against a lawsuit filed by Chris-Craft
Industries Inc., its largest shareholder, to delay Warner's $1.18
billion acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures Corp.
   Chris-Craft, a broadcasting and manufacturing company, filed the
suit Tuesday in New York State Court.
   In a statement issued Wednesday, Warner denied Chris-Craft's
claim that the merger with Lorimar, which owns six television
stations, would violate a 1984 agreement prohibiting Warner from
owning any TV station so long as it owns 25 percent or more of
Chris-Craft's BHC Inc. broadcasting subsidiary.
   Warner has a 42.5 percent stake in BHC, which it acquired from
Chris-Craft in 1984 in exchange for a 23 percent interest in
Warner's voting stock.
   Chris-Craft's suit seeks to delay the completion of the merger
until Lorimar has sold its TV stations to an outside party or
Warner has transferred enough of its BHC stock so that it owns less
than 25 percent of the unit.
   Warner has proposed putting the six Lorimar stations in a voting
trust, but Chris-Craft maintained that would still violate the 1984
agreement and cause injury to Chris-Craft.
   Warner said it intends to move forward to complete the merger,
which puts a value of about $14 on each of Lorimar's 47 million
outstanding common shares, for a total of around $630 million. In
addition, Warner plans to assume Lorimar's debt of about $550
million.
   Chris-Craft's four representatives on Warner's board of
directors abstained from voting when the merger was approved by
Warner and Lorimar in May. Chris-Craft management is said to
believe the Lorimar stations are of inferior quality and shouldn't
be purchased by Warner.

<HEAD>Profit Up 41 Percent in 2nd-Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mead Corp. said Wednesday that its earnings
jumped by 41 percent in the second quarter on a 7.4 percent rise in
sales.
   The paper products and electronic publishing company said the
gains were the result of strong demand in all of its product lines.
   For the quarter ended July 3, profit totaled $73 million, or
$1.12 a share, on net sales of $1.16 billion. That compared with
earnings of $51.9 million, or 82 cents a share, on sales of $1.08
billion in the same 1987 period.
   For the first six months, it said earnings rose 61 percent to
$138.8 million, or $2.13 a share, from $86.1 million, or $1.37 a
share, last year.
   Six-month sales rose 10.3 percent to $2.25 billion from $2.04
billion.
   Mead said a non-recurring gain of 17 cents a share was included
in this year's first-quarter results. Even without that gain,
however, the company said earnings per share were 43 percent above
those in the same period of 1987.
   Burnell R. Roberts, Mead's chairman and chief executive officer,
said strong order backlogs through the first half of the year
enabled Mead's mills and plants to operate at a high level.
   The company's publishing paper division led the second-quarter
earnings improvement, Roberts said, but orders continued to climb
for other divisions.
   Mead said the purchase of Brunswick Pulp & Paper Co. by Georgia
Pacific Corp., announced last month, will results in a one-time
gain of about $1.50 a share. That gain will be reflected in
third-quarter earnings, Mead said.

   The last Volkswagen made in America
rolls off the assembly line Thursday, when the West German
automaker closes its only U.S. assembly plant in an area already
hit hard by declining manufacturing.
   ``Ninety-nine percent of the workers here had their heart in
this place, their heart and their soul,'' said Robert Resides, 47,
of Derry. ``Everybody has in their mind: Why? What did we do
wrong?''
   Resides began working at the plant when it opened 10 years ago
amid rolling dairy farmland about 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh,
bringing the promise of prosperity and lifetime employment.
   Volkswagen says the workers did nothing wrong. The company cited
slumping sales and increased competition when it announced Nov. 20
that it would close its Westmoreland County plant, dismissing 2,500
blue- and white-collar workers and ending its U.S. manufacturing
venture.
   Many workers blame trade policies, not Volkswagen, for the
shutdown.
   ``This area was once the industrial base of the country,'' said
Ronald Dinsmore, 45, of Jeannette, who also worked at the plant for
10 years. ``Now the steel mills are gone. The rubber companies are
gone. The glass factories are gone.''
   ``We're getting beat by foreign competition,'' he said.
   Layoffs began in March, when production of the Jetta model
ended. The last Golf model rolls off the 1.5-mile-long assembly
line Thursday, the last day of work for all but 700 to 800
employees who will remain to help mothball the plant, said VW
spokesman Chet Bahn. By mid-September, about 150 employees will be
left, Bahn said.
   The Volkswagen still will be sold in the United States. Jetta
models will be imported from West Germany and Golf models from
Mexico, Bahn said.
   Gov. Robert Casey has said finding a new occupant for the
sprawling, modern plant is a top priority, but Dinsmore, shop
chairman of United Auto Workers union Local 2055, said that doesn't
ease concern about finding jobs now.
   The average VW worker earned $14 to $16 per hour, a wage that is
hard to match in the area, said Judy Wilson, supervisor of a jobs
center in the plant.
   ``What I've seen so far is you have to relocate to get a
high-paying job,'' Walter Smith, 40, of Trafford said. ``I'd like
to stay in the area. My house is all paid for.''
   Smith, an electrician, said he applied for benefits provided by
the Trade Adjustment Assistance program that would enable him to
attend a community college to learn new electronics skills. The
program helps workers who lose their jobs because of foreign
competition.
   Many laid-off workers fear finding good work may mean leaving
the area where they grew up and hoped to spend their lives.
   ``I don't know whether to move,'' said Edward Prevenslik, 46, of
Ruffsdale. ``My biggest concern now is with my daughter and
interfering with her in school.''
   Prevenslik, a maintenance man at the plant for 10 years, has
handed out resumes and studied want ads for about three months.
He's concerned about making ends meet.
   ``In the fall, when my kids start back at school, it's going to
be a little close,'' he said. ``My girl, clothes for her. ...''
   Resides found work in early July, three months after he was laid
off. His new job, as a truck driver, ends in October and requires
some time spent on the road away from his family, but he's still
grateful for temporary work.
   ``There are a lot of $3.50 an hour jobs that a person can grab
onto, but it's not a liveable wage for anybody with a family,'' he
said.
   Jack Wilson of Mount Pleasant, a welder at the plant, said his
age is a handicap.
   ``I'm 52 years old now and there's nobody who's going to hire me
without knowing me,'' he said. ``Now when you get a job,
everything's part time. If you have a family, you have to have
benefits.''
   Volkswagen is the largest employer in Westmoreland County, where
the unemployment rate in May was 6.2 percent, compared to 5.6
percent for the nation.
   The laid-off workers live in at least three counties near the
plant so the shutdown probably will not dramatically change the
unemployment rate in Westmoreland County, said Mike Acquaviva,
spokesman for the state Department of Labor and Industry.
   But the shutdown is already pinching the local economy.
   ``There's been a drop off in business, but I think we'll see
more effect in the next six months,'' said Larry Holliday, manager
of the 70-year-old Sam Levin furniture store in nearby Mount
Pleasant. ``A lot of our customers are VW employees.''
   Chrysler Corp. built the blue-and-silver plant beginning in
1968, but abandoned the project in a business slump in 1970.
   Volkswagen, trying to capitalize on a market once dominated by
its beetle, began looking for a U.S. assembly site and was lured to
southwestern Pennsylvania by former Gov. Milton Shapp. The state
spent more than $70 million to land the plant.
   The first VW Rabbit rolled off the assembly line in April 1978,
but plans to make 500,000 cars a year materialized in the
increasingly competitive small car market.

   Stocks rose in light trading on London's Stock
Exchange Wednesday, as investors waited for a barrage of U.S. and
British economic reports due later in the week.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 12.8
points, or 0.7 percent, higher at 1,871.3.
   Trading volume was 430.8 million shares, compared with Tuesday's
398 million shares.
   Traders said a strong opening on Wall Street gave the London
market a boost.
   But the impending economic reports kept many potential
participants sidelined, dealers said.
   The most crucial report was considered the U.S. trade report,
which is scheduled for release Friday.
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit is widely expected to have
grown to between $11 billion and $12 billion in May from April's
$9.9 billion.
   The market expects another round of global interest rate hikes,
but the authorities must first see the outcome of the trade figures
before raising rates, said Glenn Davies, an equities analyst with
CL-Alexanders Laing Cruickshank Ltd.

   The National OTC Stock Journal and its sister
company, OTC America Inc., are for sale following financial
difficulties, executives say.
   Terry Freeman, president of OTC America and publisher of the
weekly newspaper about the over-the-counter market, has disclosed
his companies' financial troubles in several articles and letters
written since mid-June.
   Both OTC Stock Journal, published in Denver, and OTC America are
public companies with shares traded on the pink sheets, a loosely
organized market of 20,000 issues. Both have suffered since the
October stock market crash.
   Freeman's OTC Stock Journal, published since 1981, has
chronicled the fortunes of Denver's penny stock brokers and the
companies they underwrite since the heyday of penny stocks in
Denver.
   Its major competitor is the Penny Stock News based in Columbia,
Md.
   If a sale cannot be arranged, Freeman said he would try to
continue publishing the stock journal.
   Freeman, 41, worked for CBS Inc. in San Francisco. He also
worked briefly for Penny Stock News before buying an interest in
the publication in 1981. OTC Stock Journal became a public company
through a merger with Hair Analysis Inc. in 1982.

<HEAD>House Appoves 60-Day Plant Closing, Layoff Notices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation today requiring
companies to give workers and local officials 60 days advance
notice of plant closings and large layoffs.
   The vote was 286-136. That was four more than the two-thirds
majority of those voting that would be required to override an
expected veto by President Reagan. Ten members of the House did not
vote.
   If all members voted, 288 votes would be needed to override a
veto.
   Fifty-four Republicans voted against the administration on the
issue.
   Regan vetoed a massive trade bill in May, saying the
plant-closing provision was his main reason for doing so.
   The AFL-CIO threatened to withdraw its pivotal support from the
trade measure, which was to be acted on later today in the House,
if the layoff provisions were not enacted first.
   Democrats earlier had voted to give Republican opponents only
one opportunity to amend the bill. But Republican leaders decided
against it at the last minute.
   ``There are a lot of people in this country who have not been a
part of this burgeoning economic miracle that some talk about,''
said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich. ``Nearly half of today's displaced
workers had no notice whatosover.''
   House Republicans complained they were being given only one
chance to alter a bill that is not needed in the first place in
view of the 5{-year-long economic recovery, the longest in the
nation's history.
   ``Why are we doing this?'' House Minority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., asked rhetorically. ``Job levels are at an all-time high,
unemployment is at a 14-year low.''
   Business groups made a last-ditch effort to head off what would
be organized labor's biggest political victory this decade.
   Both sides have been waging a massive grassroots letter,
telegram and phone campaign the past week.
   The House has voted on the issue only once before. The provision
was supported then by a 253-vote majority _ far short of the 290
votes that labor considers comfortable for sustaining a veto _ when
Republicans tried to strike it from a trade bill last spring.
   Reagan cited the mandated notices as his primary reason for
vetoing a massive overhauling of the nation's trade laws in May,
saying they were anticompetitive and would stifle new job creation.
   Vice President George Bush, who has wrapped up the Republican
nomination, supported Reagan's veto, saying he favors telling
workers in advance they are about to be laid off but companies
shouldn't be forced to do so.
   When subsequent polls showed more than 80 percent voter support
for requiring the notices, Democrats seized on the issue to attack
Reagan and Bush on domestic economic issues.
   ``If Edwin Meese can give himself 30 days' notice, the least we
can do is give American workers 60 days' notice before we lay them
off,'' Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis said
Tuesday.
   Meese announced his resignation as Reagan's attorney general
last week, giving no specific date when he will step down other
than to say it will be in either late July or early August.
   ``Politics has the priority,'' complained Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``It is not the working man or working
woman we're talking about. It is who might win in November. That
has become the issue, not the merits of this bill.''
   White House lobbyists pointed out after the Senate vote that
Reagan has not definitely said he would veto the plant closing
measure. Under the law, he has 10 working days to sign the bill,
exercise a veto or allow it to become law without his signature.
   But both sides still anticipate a veto, regardless the margin of
today's vote.
   Business groups fear a victory for the AFL-CIO on the plant
closing and layoff notices will open a Pandora's box of other labor
legislation such as mandated health benefits, maternity leaves and
measures making it easier for unions to organize workers.

   Grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade with most contracts up
their allowable limit in reaction to a government report showing
severe drought damage to crops.
   In addition to lowering its 1988 corn production estimate by 29
percent, the Agriculture Department estimated soybean plantings
this year ...
... expectations, analysts said.
   Those factors, plus forecasts for a return to extremely hot, dry
weather in the Midwest this weekend, sent corn and soybean prices
up their daily limits at the opening. Oats also locked limit-up and
wheat finished sharply higher.
   Scattered showers were predicted in the Corn Belt from Wednesday
night through Friday morning but traders fixated on the weekend
forecasts, analysts said.
   ``My weather people seem to feel the amounts in any rains
anticipated tonight, tomorrow and even Friday morning will be a
quarter- to a half-inch, and that's not significant enough moisture
to break any drought, particularly with the hot weather staring us
in the face,'' said Jerry Gidel, grains analyst with the
Chicago-based trading company G.H. Miller & Co.
   At the close, wheat was 7 cents to 13 cents higher with July at
$3.89{ a bushel; corn was the limit 10 cents higher across the
board except for the limitless July contract, which was up 28 cents
at $3.34 a bushel; oats were locked up the 10-cent limit with

   British Aerospace PLC said Wednesday it was
reconsidering its takeover bid for Rover Group PLC after the
European Economic Community ordered a large cut in the British
government's planned cash injection into the state-owned automaker.
   British Aerospace had reached an agreement with the British
government to acquire its 99.8 percent stake in Rover for 150
million pounds, or about $254 million at current exchange rates. At
the same time, the government had said it would inject 800 million
pounds, or around $1.35 billion, into Rover to reduce the
automaker's debt.
   But the EEC's executive Commission, which has the power to block
deals that it considers harmful to competition in the 12-nation
trading bloc, said earlier Wednesday it approved a smaller British
aid package of 469 million pounds.
   Because some regional aid also would be allowed, the government
subsidy effectively would be reduced to 547 million pounds, British
Trade Secretary Lord Young said.
   British Aerospace, an aircraft manufacturer that was privatized
by the Conservative government, said it requested more time to
consider its proposed takeover in light of the Commission's ordered
reduction in British aid.
   British Aerospace also said that trading in its shares, which
was halted earlier Wednesday pending the EEC announcement, would
remain suspended.
   Negotiations between the government and British Aerospace were
continuing, he said.
   Peter Sutherland, the EEC's competition commissioner, said in
Brussels, Belgium, that the Commission ``came to the conclusion
that not all of the elements making up the 800 million-pound
write-off could be considered as (Rover) debt.''
   He said that allowing the British government to write off all of
Rover's debt would have placed the automaker in an ``artificially
favorable situation vis-a-vis competitors.''
   Meanwhile, Rover said it swung into profit in the first half of
its fiscal year, helped by healthy operating profit at its Austin
Rover car division and a strong recovery by its Land Rover unit
after a pay dispute earlier this year. The Land Rover is an
all-terrain vehicle.
   Rover reported after-tax profit of 5 million pounds, or about $8
million, in the six months ended July 2, compared with an after-tax
loss of 42 million pounds, or $71 million, in the same period a
year earlier.
   Revenue rose to 1.55 billion pounds, or $2.62 billion, from 1.53
billion pounds, or $2.59 billion, a year earlier.

   Here are the rankings of states in the ninth
annual ``Manufacturing Climates Study'' conducted by the accounting
firm of Grant Thornton.
   For the first time since the study was conducted, states were
divided into categories of high- or low-manufacturing intensity. To
be ranked among the high-intensity group, total employment in
manufacturing in the state in 1987 must have exceeded the national
average of 17 percent or manufacturing shipments must have exceeded
the national average in dollar terms.

   Public utility companies raised their planned
spending in the final quarter of 1987, signaling possible growth in
the industry to meet future consumer demand, the Conference Board
said Wednesday.
   Spending authorizations for plant and equipment reached $6.1
billion in the final quarter of 1987, an increase of more than 11
percent from the year-earlier period and an 18.7 percent rise from
the previous quarter, the report said.
   ``This is the most positive sign we've had in quite some time
that the utility industry is beginning to recognize the need for
more capacity to meet future demand and to plan for it,'' said
Kenneth Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board, a
business-financed research organization.
   Goldstein said results of the quarterly survey represented ``a
significant turnaround in utility spending, which has been held
down by sluggish demand and regulatory and competitive pressures.''
   An increase in utility spending probably will not affect
consumers for several years, when utilities begin expanding their
current plants, he said.

   The stock market posted some spotty gains in an
on-again, off-again session today.
   Analysts said many market participants were holding back
awaiting Friday's report from the Commerce Department on the
nation's international trade balance for May.
   Some observers worry that the recent run of favorable trade news
might have about run its course, or that continued strength in
exports might provide a fresh signal of potential credit-tightening
by the Federal Reserve.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, told a congressional
committee today that the Fed took several steps to restrain the
economy in recent months with the aim of keeping inflation in check.
   However, brokers said he also seemed to be suggesting that no
further credit-tightening might be needed in the near future to
achieve that end. A rise in interest rates is ``not inevitable,''
he said.

   President Reagan on Wednesday promised to do
all he can to protect farmers from excessive losses during the
drought that is afflicting large areas of the nation.
   ``Our administration is committed to taking whatever actions are
necessary,'' Reagan told leaders of the American Farm Bureau
Federation gathered at the White House.
   On the eve of his inspection tour of southern Illinois drought
areas, he cautioned, however, ``We mustn't bust the budget.''
   Nevertheless, Reagan signaled his support for a far-ranging
relief bill agreed to on Capitol Hill on Tuesday by Democratic and
Republican leaders of the agriculture committees.
   He told the heads of the state federations that while his
administration has taken actions, including helping to keep traffic
moving on the Mississippi River and other waterways, ``needless to
say, much more needs to be done.''
   Dean Kleckner, farm bureau president, remarked about Reagan's
trip to Illinois and then presented the president with an umbrella,
saying, ``Let's hope that tomorrow you'll have need of this.''
   ``Just as I am leaving,'' Reagan quipped.
   Reagan said he had sought to make agricultural relief ``a
bipartisan effort'' in Washington and that ``so far I'm pleased by
the cooperation we've received.''
   The drought-relief bill promises payments of up to $100,000 to
keep farmers on the land despite the withering heat and lack of
rain.
   The legislation is expected to move quickly through Congress.
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said that because of what he
called the largest drought the nation's history the administration
would overlook minor flaws in the bill.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday that ``the
president generally supports this legislation.''
   Reagan, speaking to some 50 American Farm Bureau Federation
leaders seated in the Roosevelt Room, cited some elements he
believes should be taken into account before the legislation is
passed.
   Among them were:
   _``Relief should go to those who need it most. Creating
windfalls for some will mean less for the truly deserving.''
   _``Many of our farmers purchased federal crop insurance, a sound
business decision. They should not be penalized relative to farmers
who did not act with such prudence.''
   _The legislation should not force farmers to do unreasonable
things, such as giving incentives for farmers to plow under their
crops.
   Reagan also said that ``drought relief spending has to be
considered in the context of our efforts to reduce the federal
deficit.''
   ``The automatic budget sequestration cuts that overspending
triggers would take back from farmers with one hand what we're
providing in drought relief with the other,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the relief bill likely would carry a price tag of
about $5.5 billion.
   ``The bill would be financed with money that would have been
paid as subsidies to farmers in ordinary weather conditions,'' he
said. ``Because of higher cash prices, congressional aides
calculate the government farm programs could be as much as $8
billion less than originally estimated.''
   There have been indications that the White House Office of
Management and Budget may be scrutinizing the surplus of federal
dollars available under the crop acreage support program as a means
of helping the government void mandatory budget cuts in mid-August
under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act.
   Asked about this, Fitzwater said, ``there are some tradeoffs. It
is possible that the cost won't be quite as high as originally
intended, and that we certainly want to avoid a sequester, and I
think all parties want to do that.''

<HEAD>U.S. Oil Imports Up 14.1 Percent in First Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. appetite for foreign oil increased
sharply in the first half of the year, while domestic crude
production kept declining, according to an industry report
published Wednesday.
   The American Petroleum Institute's report showed U.S. imports of
crude oil and petroleum products jumped 14.1 percent in the first
six months of the year from the same period in 1987. The nation's
total oil imports rose to an average 6.93 million barrels a day
from 6.07 million barrels a year earlier.
   A barrel is equivalent to 42 gallons.
   The rising imports mean that 41 percent of the oil consumed in
this country is now imported, noted the monthly statistical report
by the Washington-based trade group.
   The spike in imports in the first half was partly the result of
differences in oil stocking between this year and 1987, the report
said. It nevertheless ``continues a very disturbing trend towards
increased reliance on foreign sources of petroleum for our basic
energy needs,'' said Edward H. Murphy, director of the group's
finance, accounting and statistics department.
   Domestic crude production, on the other hand, slipped 2.3
percent during the January-June period, to an average 8.2 million
barrels a day. The report blamed the production decline largely on
the fall in world oil prices since 1986, which it said has pushed
crude prices 40 percent lower than before the slide.
   The decline in crude output has been partly offset by a slow but
steady increase in Alaskan production as a result of projects
planned many years ago coming onstream in the past two years.

   The dollar finished mostly higher Wednesday
despite reports of central bank intervention, as investors
interpreted comments by Federal Reserve officials as supportive of
the currency.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders said the dollar started to climb when Federal Reserve
Governor Wayne Angell began testifying before the Senate Banking
Committee.
   Speaking ahead of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Angell said the
dollar should be kept ``appropriately scarce'' at home and abroad.
   ``Angell started the ball rolling,'' said James McGroarty, a
vice president at Discount Corp. ``And as the day wore on,
Greenspan's comments were equally constructive for the dollar.''
   Delivering his midyear report on monetary policy, Greenspan said
the Fed and other central banks would continue to work for stable
international exchange rates. He said he saw no evidence the growth
of U.S. exports has been affected by the recent appreciation of the
dollar.
   Despite the positive tone, traders said the Fed intervened twice
to sell dollars as the currency tested barriers on the upside. Some
market watchers speculated that the Fed merely wanted to subdue the
move in the dollar, which had been gathering considerable upward
momentum but finished off its highs.
   Trading was peppered by bursts of activity during the Fed
officials' testimony.
   Dealers remain concerned about the upcoming report on the U.S.
trade deficit for May, due Friday. ``I'm not sure if the dollar's
going to make another run (up) before the trade figures,'' said
Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Chicago-based Harris Trust
and Savings Bank.
   He said investors typically get nervous ahead of the report,
which in the past has sparked large swings in the currency.
   The dollar finished mostly higher earlier in Europe, where
traders interpreted Greenspan's testimony as mildly bullish.
   Although neither Angell or Greenspan said anything unexpected,
``any news that isn't bad news is taken as good news,'' said David
Deacon, a senior dealer at EBC-Amro bank in London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.23 Japanese yen to 132.47 yen. Later
in London, it rose to 132.83 yen. In New York the dollar closed at
132.70 yen, up from 132.51 yen Tuesday.
   In London, it cost $1.6920 to buy one pound, cheaper than
$1.6960 late Tuesday. The dollar also gained against the pound in
New York, where it cost $1.6948 vs. $1.6970 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday:
1.8424 West German marks, up from 1.8365; 1.5285 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5188; 6.2140 French francs, up from 6.1970; 1,365.88 Italian
lire, up from 1,361.75, and 1.2072 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2103.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8460 West German marks, up from 1.8376; 1.5313 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5235; 6.2265 French francs, up from 6.1940; 2.0835 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0745; 1,367.75 Italian lire, up from 1,363.25;
1.2083 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2100.
   Gold prices rose. Precious metals dealers predicted gold prices
would be affected by the trade report and said many traders are
waiting to see the data's impact on the dollar before entering the
market.
   Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid price of
gold of $440.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $436.25 on
Tuesday.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $440.40 a
troy ounce, up from $437 on Tuesday.
   In London, gold closed at a bid price of $437.25 a troy ounce,
up from $436.50 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold finished at $435.50,
up from $433.50 late Tuesday. Earlier in Hong Kong gold rose 65
cents to close at $438.28.
   Silver bullion on New York's Comex rose to $7.165 a troy ounce,
vs. $6.974 on Tuesday. In London the metal finished at a bid price
of $6.98 a troy ounce, up from $6.91 late Tuesday.

   A late round of buying attributed to computer
program trading gave the stock market a lift in the waning moments
of an erratic session Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 10 points at
its afternoon lows, closed with an 11.73-point gain at 2,104.37.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
782 up, 668 down and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 218.93 million
shares, against 161.65 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 242.78 million shares.
   A big chunk of the day's activity came in dividend-related
trading of a few high-yielding stocks.
   Otherwise, analysts said many market participants were holding

<HEAD>Harper & Row Signs Merger Agreement with Zondervan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publishing giant Harper & Row
announced Wednesday it has agreed to buy financially troubled
Zondervan Corp., the market leader in Bible sales.
   Robert Biewen, group vice president for educational and
professional publishing at Harper & Row in New York, said the
company will start a cash tender offer for all of Zondervan's more
than 4.2 million shares at $13.50 per share.
   Total cost of the merger agreement could reach about $57
million, Biewen said.
   Brent D. Clark, Zondervan corporate counsel, said it is now up
to Zondervan shareholders to approve the deal.
   ``The company believes it's a fair offer and the final decision
is left up to the shareholders in the tender-offer process,'' Clark
said.
   Grand Rapids-based Zondervan owns an 80-store chain of
bookstores and operates a book and Bible division and music
publishing concern. It owns exclusive rights for the new
International version Bible, the market leader in Bible sales.
   Zondervan's board of directors unanimously approved the deal.
The directors have been trying to sell the publisher since October
1986, when a group of hostile shareholders threatened a takeover.
The company reported a net profit in 1987 of $859,000, down 60
percent from its 1986 net profit of $2.1 million.
   ``We are pleased to have reached an agreement with such a
distinguished publishing firm, which has the financial strength to
help Zondervan achieve its full potential,'' said James G. Buick,
Zondervan's president and chief executive officer.
   Harper & Row officials said the acquisition will boost the
company's standing in the religious publishing business.
   ``Harper & Row has a long and distinguished tradition in
religious publishing, and with the acquisition of Zondervan, we are
pleased to be expanding our efforts in the largest segment of our
market,'' said George Craig, Harper & Row president and chief
executive officer.
   Biewen said Zondervan's offices would remain in Grand Rapids and
it would retain an independent editorial voice if the merger goes
through. He added that it would coordinate marketing with Harper &
Row's San Francisco-based religious publishing subsidiary.

<HEAD>Eastern Says It's Made New Offers to Machinists, Pilots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it has made new
conciliatory offers to its Machinists and pilots union, although
the financially pressed carrier is still trying to slash overall
labor costs.
   Thomas Matthews, Eastern's vice president for human resources,
said this week ``we put our best compromise on the table to get an
agreement.'' He noted that last week, Eastern and its unions made
agreements on handling safety issues and worker complaints.
   ``Those meetings let us put the safety question behind us,''
Matthews was quoted as saying in Wednesday's editions of the Wall
Street Journal. ``Now we are trying to put our other differences
behind us.''
   The proposals made this month would save Eastern an estimated
$229 million annually, the airline said. They would move it near a
goal of around 30 percent in labor cost cuts set by President Phil
Bakes in January 1987.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said management's proposal to
the pilots includes protection of salaries, days off and job
security. She said it also contains a ``fence agreement''
guaranteeing that Eastern would remain separate from Continental
Airlines by flying at least 217 aircraft and keeping the Air Line
Pilots Association as the recognized representative of Eastern
pilots.
   Eastern and nonunion Continental are both subsidiaries of
Houston-based Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline
company. Union critics have accused Texas Air management of
intending to strip Eastern's assets.
   Eastern has offered guarantees of no layoffs for any pilot hired
before July 1, 1984, and to maintain the pilots' current wages and
15 days off monthly, Ms. Ceremsak said.
   Changes in the pilots' complex work rules would save the company
$69 million a year, she said.
   For the 12,000 Machinists at Eastern, Ms. Ceremsak said, Eastern
pledged job security for anyone hired before May 16, 1984.
   Eastern's overall offer to the Machinists, with whom it's been
in federal mediation for seven months, would cut their costs to
Eastern by $160 million annually, according to the airline. The
current Machinists' offer would add $50 million to annual costs,
Ms. Ceremsak said.
   The Machinists refused to join the Eastern pilots and flight
attendants in accepting 20 percent wage cuts in February 1986 that
preceded the sale of Eastern to Texas Air.
   Ms. Ceremsak said Eastern would largely protect the wages of the
mechanics, ``to recognize their marketplace value.'' Under the
company proposal, top-scale mechanics' wages would decline from
$18.83 to $18 an hour, she said.
   The new Eastern offer would reduce baggage handlers' wages, now
at $15.60 an hour for top scale, to $10 hourly for the three-year
contract. Originally, she said, Eastern proposed cutting the
baggage handlers' pay to $10 an hour the first year of the
contract, $9 the second year and $8 the third.
   Other cuts for Machinists would involve their benefits packages,
she said, bringing them in line with Eastern's other unions.
   Machinists local President Charles E. Bryan said details of the
negotiations are supposed to be secret. He agreed that progress was
being made, but declined further comment.
   Bryan said Eastern continues to push for release from federal
mediation, which would activate a 30-day strike deadline.

   A member of the House Agriculture Committee
said Wednesday he will introduce legislation expanding the
jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to cover
stock index options.
   The measure being drafted by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., would
transfer authority to the CFTC that is now held by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   Word of the proposal gave a new twist to congressional tinkering
with the way the government oversees the nation's financial
markets. It also illustrated the turf fights that have erupted in
Congress over the issue since the financial markets' crash last
October.
   Until now, most of the attention on Capitol Hill has been
focused on a bill introduced July 7 by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.,
that would move things in the opposite direction. Markey's proposal
would shift jurisdiction over stock index futures contracts from
the CFTC to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Markey is chairman of the House telecommunications and finance
subcommittee, which oversees the SEC, the agency that regulates the
nation's stock exchanges and most options transactions. Many
members of House and Senate committees that oversee the SEC have
argued that to improve regulation of the nation's financial
markets, the SEC should be given expanded powers.
   The Agriculture Committee oversees the CFTC, the regulator of
the futures markets. Members of the House and Senate agriculture
panels have sought to defend the CFTC's jurisdiction.
   At a hearing of the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday,
English noted that after the October crash, the SEC received far
more complaints from investors than did the CFTC. The SEC has
reported receiving 620 letters and 9,360 telephone calls from
mid-October thru late November with complaints, while the CFTC says
it has logged three complaints about the crash.
   ``You have one regulator doing a very good job ... and another,
where all the complaints occurred, that hasn't appeared to be
doning a very good job,'' English said.
   The lawmaker said that if regulatory powers are to be
consolidated, ``Perhaps we ought to unify in the direction from
which we're getting the least public complaints.''

<HEAD>First Chicago Has Strong 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Chicago Corp., the nation's 10th largest
banking company, reported vastly improved second-quarter earnings
Wednesday, due partly to its sale of $900 million of securities
backed by credit-card debt.
   First Chicago reported net income of $122.9 million, or $2.02
per share, for the three months ending June 30, compared with a net
loss of $599.9 million, or $10.96 per share, for the same period a
year ago.
   The loss in the second quarter of 1987 was due to an $800
million addition to reserves to cover potential losses on loans to
troubled countries, the company said.
   Net interest income for the second quarter was $305.9 million
compared with $309.4 million a year ago. Non-interest income for
the quarter totaled $234.7 million compared with $120.7 million a
year ago.
   First Chicago's sale of $900 million in securities backed by
credit card receivables had the effect of lowering the company's
net interest income while raising its non-interest income, said
spokesman Anthony B. Zehnder.
   Return on common assets for the second quarter was 1.09 percent
and return on common equity was 30.18 percent.
   For the first six months of 1988, First Chicago had net income
of $264.4 million, or $4.40 per share, compared with a net loss of
$536.1 million, or $9.90 a share, a year ago.
   Net interest income for the first half was $621.2 million,
compared with $587.2 million a year ago. Non-interest income
totaled nearly $630.6 million, compared with $543.8 million.
   First Chicago said it had reduced outstanding loans to troubled
countries by $350 million during the second quarter and by $505
million since the end of 1987.

<HEAD>Grain Prices Soar On Crop Report, Weather Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices blasted out of their recent
slump Wednesday in response to the government's report of severe
drought damage to crops and forecasts for more hot, dry weather in
the Farm Belt.
   On other markets, silver futures soared, pulling the precious
metals higher; livestock and meat futures were mixed; cotton
plummeted; energy futures sank; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Analysts said Tuesday's special crop report from the Agriculture
Department was largely responsible for the leap in prices for
future deliveries of grain and soybeans.
   Besides slashing its 1988 corn production estimate by 29 percent
to a 5-year low of 5.2 billion bushels, the USDA estimated soybean
plantings this year at 58.52 million acres, a figure below the
market's expectations, analysts said.
   The agency also lowered its soybean and wheat production
estimates by 12 and 13 percent respectively, and predicted overall
grain production would be nearly 25 percent below last year's level.
   Many traders had called the damage estimates conservative and
some were predicting, even minutes before the markets opened, that
soybean prices would rise only moderately on the data.
   But within minutes of the opening bell, traders had bid most
corn contracts up the maximum of 10 cents a bushel and most soybean
contracts were up their 30-cents-a-bushel limit. The sharp advances
halted trading in all but the July contracts, on which limits have
been removed pending their July 20 expiration.
   Jerry Gidel, an analyst in Chicago with the trading firm G.H.
Miller & Co., called the crop-production numbers ``impressive'' and
said most traders apparently came to the same conclusion after
digesting the data.
   ``I guess their enthusiasm picked up after they had a chance to
sleep on it,'' he said.
   In addition to the crop report, forecasts for a return to
extremely hot, dry weather in the Midwest kept the buy orders
coming. Gidel said unfilled buy orders for December deliveries of
corn totaled more than 30 million bushels at the close of the
session, and unfilled buy orders for November soybeans totaled more
than 6 million bushels.
   Scattered showers were predicted in the Midwest from Wednesday
night through Friday morning but traders fixated on forecasts for
the weekend and beyond, analysts said.
   A National Weather Service 6-to-10-day forecast issued after the
close predicted above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall
for most growing areas during the middle and latter parts of next
week.
   The agency's 30-day outlook called for continued hot and dry
conditions in the Midwest and Great Plains through mid-August.
   Wheat settled 10} cents to 17 cents higher with July at $3.92 a
bushel; corn was 10 cents to 27{ cents higher with July at $3.33{ a
bushel; oats were 10 cents to 25{ cents higher with July at $3.04{
a bushel; soybeans were 30 cents to 69 cents higher with July at
$9.48{ a bushel.
   Reports of a silver miners' strike in Peru sent silver futures
prices soaring on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   But John O'Connell, metals analyst in New York with Refco Inc.,
said abundant supplies of silver in the exchange's approved
warehouses should temper any fears of shortages.
   ``I think there's enough silver in Comex warehouses to take care
of everybody for a long time,'' he said.
   Silver settled 19.1 cents to 20.6 cents higher with July at
$7.165 a troy ounce; gold was $3.10 to $3.90 higher with August at
$441.80 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures resumed the drought-driven trading
pattern of recent months, featuring sharply lower prices on
contracts for summer and fall delivery.
   Live cattle were unchanged to the limit 1.50 cents lower with
August at 64.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent to the
limit 1.50 cents lower with August at 74.22 cents a pound; hogs
were 1.30 cents lower to .93 cent higher with July at 44.75 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .52 cent to 1.57 cents higher with
July at 33.62 cents a pound.
   Cotton futures had a sharp negative reaction to the USDA crop
report, which boosted the prediction for the July 31, 1989, surplus
from 6.8 million bales to 7.4 million bales. On the New York Cotton
Exchange, cotton settled 1.49 cents to 1.82 cents lower with
October at 57.58 cents a pound.
   Crude oil prices skidded to a 21-month low on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid pessimism about OPEC overproduction.
Gasoline futures plummeted on profit-taking, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 25 cents
lower with August at $14.44 a barrel; heating oil was .32 cent to
.67 cent lower with August at 40.14 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .75 cent to 3 cents lower with August at 50.48 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled 2.05 points higher at 271.40.

   Complaints against a insurer selling drought
insurance grew Wednesday as a group of Indiana farmers sued the
company and Iowa regulators filed charges against it for allegedly
reneging on policies.
   Critics have accused Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of
Chubb Group Insurance Cos., of backing off on its promise to pay
awards for lack of rain.
   Chubb says it was swamped with applications in the final days of
the enrollment period, which lasted from May 1 to June 17, and that
applications exceeded the amount of coverage it wanted to provide.
The policy promises a payoff if rainfall falls below a set level.
   Because of the flood of requests from about 10 Farm Belt states,
Chubb has promised to return premiums and said it is working with
state insurance departments on the matter.
   But 29 farmers in east-central Indiana say the company is
unfair, and filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Jay Circuit Court alleging
Chubb acted in bad faith by reneging on $2.5 million worth of the
insurance.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages from Federal and Pio-Gard
Agency of Ohio Inc., based in Des Moines, Iowa. The suit said
Pio-Gard sold the policies on or about June 15.
   Earlier Wednesday, Chubb spokeswoman Mary Lu Korkuch said the
company had a ``108-year history of being equitable and acting with
integrity,'' and said the company was hoping to settle the
situation as soon as possible.
   She did not return telephone calls later in the day seeking
comment on the Indiana lawsuit and Iowa action.
   On Wednesday, Iowa's state insurance commissioner held a news
conference to announce charges of misrepresentation against
Federal, which sold 1,500 policies to Iowa farmers.
   Commissioner William Hager said only four of those policies had
been put in force despite an average $1,000 premium paid by each
farmer.
   Iowa would seek to force the company to live up to the policies'
terms or return double the premiums paid, said Hager.
   The commissioner charged Federal with failing to file
endorsements with state regulators until after ads were run, to
certify Iowa sales agents, and to issue more than four policies
despite accepting 1,500 applications.
   An administrative hearing on charges in Indiana is set for July
26.
   Chubb returned premiums to an Elkton, Ky., agent who took out
policies for 42 neighboring farmers in Tennessee and Kentucky, but
the farmers have voted to reject the refund, the agent said.
   Agent Bill Knuckles said the farmers asked him at a meeting
Tuesday to send the checks back to Chubb with a demand that the
company provide coverage.
   Charges might be filed by Michigan insurance officials against
Chubb, unlicensed agents in Michigan who sold the policy, and the
Chubb agent that developed it, based in Jericho, N.Y., said an
official of the state insurance bureau.
   The official, Eric Nordman, director of property and liability,
said Chubb officials have promised to contact Michigan farmers and
offer them twice their premiums as compensation.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed After Early Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bonds were mixed Wednesday in moderate trading
after early gains in which investors responded favorably to Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's renewed pledge to tighten
credit to keep inflation under control.
   However, the market lost ground late in the day as commodity
prices rose. In addition to their nagging inflation fears, bond
traders also worried about a burgeoning supply of bonds later this
summer.
   William Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., cited proposals aired in Washington that
would permit the U.S. Treasury to issue new 30-year bonds in August.
   ``Earlier, there was no chance of more bonds at refunding,''
Sullivan said. ``Now there could be more supply coming on in
August.''
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 11-32 point, or
about $3.40 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield rose to 9.17
percent from 9.13 percent late Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, shorter-term issues finished on the plus side.
   Early in the day, investors reacted positively to Greenspan's
report to the Senate Banking Committee that the Federal Reserve
would continue to follow tight monetary policies and hold the
dollar steady, said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist for
Smith Barney, Harris, Upham & Co.
   Worries about inflation intensified last week when the Labor
Department announced the lowest civilian unemployment rate in 14
years as well as strong gains in employment.
   Greenspan also warned of growing signs of price pressures
stemming from other factors such as the drought and high industry
operating rates.
   Investors also remained cautious as they awaited Friday's report
from the Commerce Department on the trade deficit for May, Sullivan
said.
   Analysts say if the trade deficit widens too much, it would hurt
the dollar and lead to further declines in bond prices.
   ``The downturn last Friday and this week are in anticipation of
(unfavorable) reports,'' Sullivan said.
   In April, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $9.9
billion, its best showing in three years.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to 1-32 point higher, intermediate
maturities were up by between 1-32 point and 1-16 point and 20-year
issues rose 3-16 point, according to the financial information
service Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.09 to 108.69. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, was down
0.82 to 1,137.50.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities each fell [
point in moderate activity, according to the investment firm
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 1.39 to 281.12.
   Three-month Treasury bills fell 3 basis points to a discount
rate of 6.72 percent. Six-month bills dropped 1 basis point to 6.96
percent, while one-year bills were off 2 basis points to 7.22
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7{ percent, up from 7] percent late Tuesday.

   An election-year juggernaut to force employers
to give workers 60 days' notice before closing plants or ordering
large layoffs cleared the House on a 286-136 vote Wednesday,
setting up a likely veto showdown with President Reagan.
   Fifty-four Republicans abandoned the administration, giving the
White House nine fewer votes than the 145 _ or one third _
necessary to sustain a veto, assuming all 432 members vote.
   The legislation passed the Senate by a veto-proof 72-23 vote
last week. The House tally, if repeated exactly, also would be
sufficient to override a veto, but 10 members _ seven Democrats
including Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and three Republicans _ did
not vote. A veto override would require 288 votes if all members
voted.
   ``I suspect the president will veto it,'' said House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill. ``The legislation is here to create an
issue, not because people are demanding it.''
   But former GOP opponents of the bill immediately began sending
signals to Reagan and Vice President George Bush, the party's sure
presidential nominee, not to press an issue that Democrats can use
in the November elections.
   ``I don't think he'll be able to sustain a veto,'' said Rep.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J. ``There are a lot more than 54 Republicans
who don't want him to veto it. We fought every fight; Bush is going
to have to handle the issue now.''
   Later Wednesday, the House passed on a 376-45 vote a massive
overhauling of the nation's trade laws that Reagan vetoed in May,
primarily because the layoff notices then were a part of it. Senate
leaders have said they do not anticipate acting on the trade bill
until early next month.
   With polls showing that more that 80 percent of voters support
mandated layoff notices, unions successfully persuaded Democratic
congressional leaders to attempt enacting the measure before
considering a revived trade bill that Reagan vetoed in May because
it included the notices.
   ``Today's House vote, coupled with last week's overwhelming
Senate margin, clearly gives the White House a strong message that
this bill should be signed,'' said AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland,
who called it an issue of fairness for workers.
   Business groups, however, said they are still counting on Reagan
for a veto.
   ``If he vetoed the trade bill because of it, I don't know why he
would turn around now,'' said Renee Reymond, the National
Association of Manufacturers' chief lobbyist on the issue.
   White House officials have pointed out that Reagan has not said
directly that he would veto layoff notices as a stand-alone bill,
although his senior advisers have said they would urge him to do so.
   Reagan cited the plant-closing language as his primary reason
for vetoing the overhauling of the nation's trade laws in May,
arguing that the notices would stifle competition by hamstringing
businesses in moments requiring quick action.
   ``These bills are linked because they have an effect on each
other,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich. ``I've got 5,000 workers
in Michigan whose trade readjustment assistance is running out this
week. There are a lot of people in this country who have not been a
part of this burgeoning economic miracle that some talk about.''
   Under the law, the president has 10 days _ excluding Sundays _
to sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without his
signature once it is delivered to the White House, expected
sometime next week.
   Bush supported Reagan's veto in May, saying he favors telling
workers in advance they are about to be laid off but that companies
shouldn't be forced by the government to do so.
   Democrats have seized on the issue to attack Reagan and Bush on
domestic economic issues.
   ``If Edwin Meese can give himself 30 days' notice, the least we
can do is give American workers 60 days' notice before we lay them
off,'' Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis said
Tuesday.
   Meese announced last week he would resign as attorney general,
but said he wouldn't actually depart until late this month or early
August.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, a liberal Massachusetts Republican and
co-sponsor of the measure, cited a General Accounting Office study
showing that the average layoff notice given workers in this
country is seven days.
   ``It takes two months to get a worker readjustment program going
at a plant,'' Conte said. ``Most of the heartache of losing a job
could be avoided if companies just give workers enough notice to
readjust their lives.''
   Layoff notices have been required in Canada, Japan and most
European countries for years. And a 1986 study by the congressional
Office of Technology Assistance found little opposition to them in
those foreign settings by subsidiaries of American-owned companies.
   But business groups feared a victory for the AFL-CIO on the
plant closing and layoff notices will open a Pandora's box of other
labor legislation such as mandated health benefits, maternity
leaves and measures making it easier for unions to organize workers.

   The House passed 376-45 on Wednesday a
revamped version of its massive trade bill, now largely tailored to
conditions set by President Reagan when he vetoed the original in
May.
   ``The best protection for our economic future is this trade
bill,'' Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowksi, D-Ill., declared
in a two-hour debate.
   Only 41 Republicans and four Democrats held out against the
1,000-page bill. Leaders of both parties said Reagan will sign the
bill if the Senate passes it in its current form.
   Earlier in the afternoon, the House passed 286-136 a separate
bill to force employers to give 60 days advance notice to workers
of plant closings and major layoffs. That was a feature of the
initial trade bill and was cited by Reagan as the basis for his
veto.
   Even the severest critics of the trade legislation conceded it
was headed for law. Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn., declared he was
``not a fan'' of the measure but urged the House to go ahead and
pass it ``rather than fooling around with trade'' when it should be
focusing on the budget deficit.
   Before acting on the bill itself, the House rejected 237-183 an
attempt to delete the measure's provisions for duty-free imports of
ethanol produced at Caribbean refineries from European and
Brazilian base products.
   Ethanol is fuel produced from a variety of farm products,
notably corn. The provision came under attack from House Minority
Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill, whose district includes huge corn
refineries.
   Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said the measure punishes ``these
drought-stricken farmers as much as the searing sun.'' Critics
scoffed at the Michel-Durbin proposal as a delaying tactic. Rep.
Robert Matsui, D-Calif., said the provision would help consumers by
assuring a reliable supply of ethanol at reasonable prices.
   ``Unfortunately what you are hoping for is some excess profits
out of it,'' Matsui said.
   The plant-closings plan was but one part of the trade bill
passed in May, but President Reagan singled it out for criticism in
his veto. He said it would rob managers of the flexibility to
operate their companies at peak economic health. Sponsors say
warning family breadwinners of impending layoffs is the decent and
compassionate thing to do.
   Declaring their intent to meet Reagan's objections, Democratic
leaders split off the plant-losings provision and reconstituted it
as a separate bill. They also dropped new curbs on exports of
Alaska oil.
   The measures remain closely tied together, however, and came to
the House floor under a rule that required the chamber to take up
plant closings first and then go immediately to trade. It reflected
a move by congressional leaders to ease the concerns of union
officials over separating the issues.
   The trade bill was expected to come to the floor in the Senate
at an unspecified time after next week's Democratic National
Convention.
   Some Democrats say Gov. Michael Dukakis' choice of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, as his running mate on the national Democratic
ticket provides all the more reason to push ahead with the trade
bill.
   Bentsen is chief Senate sponsor of the measure and placing the
bill on Reagan's desk at the opening of the presidential campaign
might be expected to lend a note of drama to the issue.
   Renewed congressional action on what House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, described as ``the trade and jobs bill'' follows a June
unemployment rate of 5.3 percent, a 14-year low, and an April
merchandise trade deficit of $9.9 billion, the lowest since
December 1984.
   The administration has been hoping since September 1984 to pound
a massive dent in the trade deficit by lowering the dollar, thus
raising the cost of imports while making it easier to sell U.S.
products overseas. There is no way to forecast what May trade
figures due Friday will show, but the red ink for February was
$14.4 billion and for March was $11.9 billion.
   Provisions of the bill would grant the administration authority
to reach agreements in the current Uruguay Round of international
trade talks and guarantee them speeded up consideration by Congress
with no amendments.
   Procedures under which the United States imposes import curbs to
protect U.S. industries and retaliate against trade violations
would be streamlined under the measure. Other features range from
repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil company earnings to as
much as $2 billion in agricultural subsidies.

improvement by its broadcast group despite a sluggish advertising
market, a rise in interest income and the effects of cost-cutting.
   But the company said the outlook for the rest of the year
remained clouded due to the continuing strike by the Writers Guild
of America, which could reduce the amount of new programming
available for the fall television season.
   CBS said it earned $128.7 million, or $5.01 a share, in the
three months ended June 30, compared with an after-tax profit of
$92.1 million, or $3.77 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4
percent to $740 million from $714 million.
   For the first six months of the year, CBS earned $1.04 billion,
or $40.43 a share, up about sevenfold from $140.8 million, or $5.70
a share, a year earlier. Revenues were unchanged at $1.44 billion.
   The latest six-month results included a one-time gain of $866.6
million from the sale of the CBS magazine and record groups.
   Laurence A. Tisch, president and chief executive, said income
from continuing operations and net income were the highest in the
company's history.
   ``The CBS Broadcast Group scored higher sales in spite of a
sluggish advertising market, and improved its operating margin,
underscoring the effectiveness of ongoing efforts to reduce costs
and improve operating efficiences,'' he said.
   He said sales and profits rose at the CBS Television network,
the CBS television stations and the CBS radio division. The
television network benefitted from sports programming, which
included the championship events of college and professional
basketball.
   Net corporate interest income climbed to $43.9 million in the
quarter from $6.7 million a year earlier, reflecting investment of
proceeds from the company's recent asset sales.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has
told Congress that the central bank stands ready to push interest
rates higher to stem inflation.
   Greenspan said Wednesday that the risks of a new wage-price
spiral are ``sufficiently great'' that the Fed should tighten
credit rather than stimulate the economy.
   In his mid-year report on monetary policy, Greenspan said the
Fed already has made a series of small credit-tightening steps from
late March through late June, allowing short term interest rates to
rise.

   A measure to force employers to give workers
60 days notice before closing plants or ordering large layoffs has
cleared the House on a 286-136 vote, setting up a likely veto
showdown with President Reagan.
   Fifty-four Republicans abandoned the administration, giving the
White House 9 fewer votes than the 145 needed to sustain a veto,
assuming all 432 members vote.
   The legislation passed the Senate by a veto-proof 72-23 vote
last week. The House tally on Wednesday, if repeated exactly, also
would be sufficient to override a veto, but 10 members _ seven
Democrats including Speaker Jim Wright of Texas and three
Republicans _ did not vote.

   The fast food chain has opened eight such restaurants

   Domestic light truck sales climbed by 8.6 percent on a daily

sales of U.S. made cars, the automakers reported Wednesday.
   Combined car and light truck sales totaled 228,870 for the seven

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co., responding to Apple
Computer Inc.'s copyright infringement suit, filed a countersuit in
a federal court Wednesday alleging unfair business practices by
Apple and violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
   Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., denied all of
Apple's allegations and asked the U.S. District Court in San Jose
to invalidate Apple's copyrights in the case and to dismiss its
suit against Hewlett-Packard.
   ``(Hewlett-Packard) is confident the court will agree Apple's
suit has no merit,'' said Douglas C. Chance, executive vice
president of the company's Business Systems Sector.
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., sued Hewlett-Packard and
Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., in March, charging them with
copyright infringement in two so-called ``operating environment''
programs: Microsoft's Windows and Hewlett-Packard's NewWave.
   Operating environment programs provide a visual ``desktop'' on
the screen, on which a computer user can view various symbols
representing documents, applications programs and places to store
information.
   Apple's suit shook software developers and computer makers
throughout the industry because of its potential scope. Besides
taking aim at Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, Apple also indirectly
challenged its biggest rival, International Business Machines
Corp., which has been incorporating display graphics similar to
Apple's.
   Apple was seen as essentially asking the court to preserve a
technological edge it has enjoyed over its competitors, just as the
rivals were starting to close the gap.
   In April, Microsoft submitted a response to the court in San
Jose, charging that Apple violated contracts, acted in bad faith
and damaged Microsoft's relations with other companies.
   Microsoft denied that its Windows product infringed on Apple
copyrights by using images that too closely resembled the ``look
and feel'' of Apple's popular Macintosh computer.
   Hewlett-Packard claimed in its countersuit that Apple does not
hold valid copyrights for the visual displays and images because
Apple did not originate them.
   ``By claiming sole authorship of those displays and images,
Apple misled the U.S. Copyright Office in order to stifle
competition and hamper (Hewlett-Packard), Microsoft and others from
entering a market _ graphical user-interface operating environments
for personal computers _ that Apple dominates,'' Hewlett-Packard
said in a statement.
   Hewlett-Packard also said ``Apple misled the court and the
public by altering Hewlett-Packard screen images to create the
false impression that they are similar to the Apple Macintosh.
   ``(Hewlett-Packard) believes Apple's real concern is not that
some features of NewWave resemble those of the Macintosh, but that
NewWave delivers what Apple itself has described as its vision of
the future.''
   On Monday, the court granted Hewlett-Packard's motion to
disqualify the Palo Alto-based law firm of Fenwick, Davis and West
from representing Apple. Hewlett-Packard claimed that the firm had
previously worked for it and should not be allowed to participate
in a suit between the companies.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp. announced Wednesday that Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp. will resume control of three of the Dallas-based
company's pension plans and their assets.
   The plans have been the subject of dispute between the steel and
energy company, which is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy
protection from creditors, and the PBGC, a government agency that
insures pension benefits.
   The PBGC took over LTV's steel company pension plans, which were
$2 billion in debt, in January 1987 after the company terminated
them, making the agnency LTV's biggest creditor.
   But the agency attempted to restore LTV's responsibility for the
plans the following September, after a new LTV labor contract with
the United Steelworkers of America restored some benefits
previously cut.
   A federal judge on June 22 in Manhattan refused to uphold PBGC's
decision to force LTV to reassume the pension obligations, stating
that the agency had not presented a good enough case for the move.
   LTV has contended since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection two years ago that it can not successfully reorganize if
it is held responsible for the $2 billion shortfall of the pension
plans.
   Company officials said the resumption of PBGC responsibility
should not affect LTV Steel retirees or their benefits. Officials
said they will work with the PBGC to assure payments continue
during the transition period.

<HEAD>Stempel: GM To Offer Air Bags Standard By 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILFORD, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will install
driver-side air bags as standard equipment on 500,000 cars a year
by 1990 because ``they aren't selling like hotcakes'' as costly
options, GM's president said Wednesday.
   Robert Stempel said GM will not begin phasing in passenger-side
air bags until 1990, unlike some of its competitors, and will not
include them as standard equipment until 1992 because the
technology still is being developed.
   Stempel also said GM would include rear lap-and-shoulder belts
as standard equipment on all 1989 models. He said automakers did
not include rear shoulder belts previously because they had
believed passengers were safer in the back seat than in the front
seat and needed less restraint.
   The federal government requires automakers to have passive
restraints _ automatic shoulder belts or driver-side air bags
combined with manual shoulder-lap belts _ by 1990. The regulation
requires passive restraints on an increasing percentage of each
maker's vehicles each year until 1990, but leaves makers the
discretion to offer them as standard equipment or as options.
   Chrysler Corp. has said it would include air bags as standard
equipment on all its U.S.-produced models by 1990 and will use
automatic belts on its smaller, imported models.
   Ford Motor Co. and GM will use a more even mix of air bags and
automatic belts than Chrysler. Ford has had some success offering
air bags as options but also will make them standard on many
vehicles.
   Stempel spoke at the 20th anniversary of the GM Research and
Development Laboratory at GM's 4,000-acre Milford proving ground,
where vehicle research includes in-depth safety studies that have
produced such new devices as the self-aligning steering wheel.
   The new safety steering wheel, which is being introduced on the
1989 Chevrolet Cavalier, is a hollow hub on six metal tabs that
collapse on impact to flatten the wheel against the driver's torso,
evenly distributing impact force across the entire wheel to reduce
potential face and chest injuries.
   The wheel, developed by four GM engineers, is effective but not
costly and will be phased in on other cars not equipped with air
bags, primarily economy cars. Stempel said he believed buyers of
cheaper cars were less likely to accept the added cost of an air
bag.
   He said GM will make air bags standard only on its middle- and
upper-price range vehicles, because those buyers are more willing
to shoulder the air bag cost. But if they are given a choice, they
also tend to ignore the air bags, he said.
   ``Oldsmobiles with air bags are not selling like hotcakes. By
themselves, they don't seem to be a saleable feature,'' Stempel
said. ``Most people don't buy a car thinking they are going to be
in an accident.
   ``We'll have to move toward standard installation of air bags to
get them in there in any number.''
   For 1989, GM will offer driver-side air bags on the Oldsmobile
Delta 88 and 98 and the Cadillac DeVille, Fleetwood and Fleetwood
60 Special, Stempel said.

<HEAD>First Boston Posts Second Quarter Profit Following Year-Earlier
Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Boston Inc. posted a second-quarter profit
of $43.7 million on Wednesday, compared with a $13.2 million loss
in the same period a year earlier.
   Earnings for the investment banking firm, which amounted to
$1.20 per share, stemmed partly from strong merger and acquisition
activity, according to Peter T. Buchanan, First Boston's president
and chief executive officer.
   The firm reported revenue of $365.5 million, up 80 percent from
$202.6 million a year earlier, for the three months ended June 30.
   The year-earlier loss stemmed largely from losses in bond
trading, particularly in volatile options on 30-year Treasury
bonds. First Boston and other firms lost millions of dollars when
bond prices plummeted in April 1987 over speculation that the
then-weakening dollar would reignite high inflation.
   During the latest quarter, revenue from principal transactions _
those conducted for its own account _ jumped to $88.5 million from
a loss of $108.4 million a year earlier, the firm reported.
   Commission revenue fell to $31.8 million from $41.6 million,
while investment banking revenue rose to $261.4 million from $245.4
million.
   For the six months ended June 30, First Boston posted a profit
of $85.7 million, or $2.37 per share, up from $63 million, or $1.79
per share, for the same period last year.
   Revenue rose to $704.7 million in the first half from $685.9
million in the year-earlier period.

   A Texas-based air conditioning equipment maker
has offered about $795 million to acquire York International Corp.,
which already has agreed to a $750 million buyout led by Citicorp,
York announced Wednesday.
   SnyderGeneral Corp., which is based in Dallas, offered $61 a
share to acquire York, which also manufactures heating and air
conditioning equipment.
   Late last month, York agreed to be acquired by York Holdings
Corp., a new group capitalized by Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.
and other investors, for $57.50 a share in cash and debentures, or
a total of about $750 million. The investor group began its tender
offer on July 1.
   York International stock rose $3.25 to $59.12{ a share Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Officials from Citicorp, York International and SnyderGeneral
would not comment on the competing offer.
   More than a dozen suits have been filed by shareholders who say
the Citicorp-led offer of $57.50 per share offer is too small. The
suits, which name York International, members of its board, York
Holdings and others as defendants, are aimed at stopping the sale,
according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents.
   SnyderGeneral is a privately-held company that employs about
4,800 people at nine facilities, including two in Europe.
   York International employs 1,600 people. It was a division of
Borg-Warner Corp. until it was spun off to stockholders in 1986.
