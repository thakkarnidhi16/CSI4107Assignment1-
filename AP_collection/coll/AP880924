   As a student recruiter for the American Civil
Liberties Union, young Michael Dukakis found an unwitting and
unlikely ally in Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
   The place was Swarthmore College, the time was the mid-1950s,
and McCarthy's red-baiting rampages _ his fulminations about
``card-carrying Communists'' _ had galvanized civil libertarians.
   ``McCarthy was our greatest membership recruiter,'' Dukakis
recalled in an interview last May with the Los Angeles Times.
   No one is likely to describe George Bush as an ACLU recruiter,
but officials of the civil liberties union say he, too, is helping
draw members, money and mail to the organization's cluttered Times
Square headquarters.
   Bush has persistently attacked Dukakis for being a member of the
ACLU, and has turned Dukakis' tongue-in-cheek description of
himself as a ``card-carrying member'' on its head.
   The organization is fighting back. It is planning an advertising
campaign featuring actors Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry of
``L.A. Law'' and Burt Lancaster to battle what it says are
misrepresentations by the Bush campaign.
   ``There's a smell of McCarthyism about those kinds of attacks,''
ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser said in a recent interview.
``And while that has happened from time to time from people like Ed
Meese and Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond ... it has never before
been leveled during a presidential campaign by a major party
candidate.''
   Should membership be an issue in a presidential race?
   ACLU officials say no. In their view, the ACLU is a
non-partisan, non-ideological organization whose sole function is
to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. An attack on the
ACLU, they say, is an attack on the very foundations of democracy.
   But others _ mainly conservatives _ say the ACLU is not the
politically neutral organization it claims to be, but a left-wing
``criminal's lobby,'' to use the phrase favored by former Attorney
General Edwin Meese III.
   ``They are probably one of the most rigidly ideological
organizations in the country,'' said Dan Casey, executive director
of the American Conservative Union.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, stung by a newspaper column
which noted his past membership in the ACLU, issued a statement
Thursday saying he left the organization because it had a
``separate political agenda, many portions of which I strongly
disagreed with.''
   The ACLU and the Reagan administration tangled frequently:
   _ The ACLU, for the first time, took a position on the
appointment of a Supreme Court justice when it opposed the
nomination of Robert Bork.
   _ The ACLU strongly supports the Supreme Court decision which
established a woman's right to abortion.
   _ The ACLU was on the losing side in a 1987 case in which the
Supreme Court, on a 6-3 vote, supported pre-trial detention of
suspects who are determined to be dangerous.
   _ The ACLU lost again this year when the Supreme Court upheld
the Adolescent Family Life Act. ACLU attorneys had objected that
money was given to groups which were promoting religious positions.
   But the Reagan administration is not the first to battle the
ACLU. The organization was founded in 1920 in response to the
Palmer raids, the name given to Attorney General A. Mitchell
Palmer's efforts to deport immigrants for their radical beliefs.
   The organization has defended all sorts of radicals _ from the
Communist Party to the Nazi Party, from the Black Panthers to the
Ku Klux Klan _ to hold and espouse their beliefs.
   The ACLU has successfully argued that poor people have the right
to a lawyer and that police should inform criminal suspects of
their right to remain silent.
   Meese often attacked the Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda decision
that required police to read suspects their rights. Meese once said
the ruling ``only helps guilty defendants.''
   One past Supreme Court case which figures in this presidential
campaign is one in which the ACLU sided with Jehovah's Witnesses
who challenged a law which compelled them to join in the Pledge of
Allegiance. The Supreme Court in 1943 struck down the law _ and
that decision was cited by Dukakis when he vetoed a Massachusetts
bill that required teachers to lead the pledge every day.
   The court's decision in the Pledge of Allegiance case contained
``probably the most ringing language of any Supreme Court decision
on why the constitution forbids the state from telling people to
take oaths,'' Glasser said.
   ``The words are fine. `Liberty, justice, indivisible.' We love
those words. Those words might be the motto of the ACLU.''
   Many of the ACLU's causes have been unpopular, Glasser said,
because the government tends to target unpopular groups.
   ``You know, we don't choose our clients,'' he said. ``If we are
representing more people on the left, it's because the government
is prosecuting more people on the left.''
   Casey, however, believes the ACLU has a mindset ``of blaming the
actions of criminals on society; it's a mindset where the system of
justice favors criminals over the law-abiding citizens; it's a view
of an extraordinarily libertine society that could probably best be
summed up by the phrase, `If it feels good, do it and don't make it
illegal.'''
   Glasser puts it this way: ``If I were to asked to characterize
what the Constitution means in a single line ... I would say, `It's
the right to be let alone. It's the notion that the government has
power to do certain things like protect us against foreign
domination, maintain the streets, tax us for various things. But
they don't have the right to tell me how to live.''

<HEAD>Small Alaskan Crab Harvest May Put A Pinch On Diners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fishermen preparing to catch Alaska's
premium crab next week face a harvest projected to be 40 percent
below last year's, which could produce a quantum jump in prices and
put a pinch on restaurant owners.
   State biologists said they were surprised to discover data
showing a shortfall of red king crab after anticipating a
burgeoning harvest for the Bristol Bay fishing grounds this year.
They had projected a 20 percent to 30 percent increase in the 1988
haul over the 1987 take of 12.3 million pounds.
   But when the harvest opens Sunday, it will draw at least 200
boats competing for an estimated 7.5 million pounds of crab, said
Ken Griffin, an Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist. The
harvest will likely last less than seven days, he said.
   The crab industry is $30 million business, Griffin said.
   Biologists suspect a variety of causes for the instability in
the population of the red king crab, which is available only off
the Alaska coast.
   The Bristol Bay fishing area, off Alaska's southwest coast,
yielded a peak harvest of 139 million pounds in 1980. But for
reasons still not understood, the crab population was decimated in
1982, and the fishery was not opened that year.
   The harvest that begins this weekend will be the year's major
catch of the seafood, which vies with cold-water lobster tails as a
premium item on restaurant menus in the United States and abroad.
   ``Demand is very strong both domestically and in Japan,'' said
John Martin, a shellfish promotion specialist for the Alaska
Seafood Marketing Institute.
   But a massive increase in prices could scare restaurateurs to
the point that they substitute less costly seafood as
top-of-the-line fare, Martin said.
   ``The best thing that's happened in the king crab business in
the last two years has been the stability of the prices,'' he said
Thursday.
   ``As long as we offer a high-quality product at competitive
prices, (red king crab) is very popular,'' he said. It brought $10
to $12 a pound wholesale in 1987.
   Brown and blue king crabs also are harvested off the Alaska
coast, but are valued less than their red cousin.
   Griffin said biologists don't know exactly why the supply
plunged. Influences that have been examined include interference
from bottomfishing, disease, increased water temperature and
harvests of undersized crab.
   Officials are combatting the harvest of the smaller crabs with a
state law requiring monitors to travel aboard vessels processing
crab at sea, where previously they had been been unable to observe
the catch. That law, similar to a federal measure for some of the
vessels in foreign fleets, requires observers to verify the
quantities and sizes of crab caught.
   But some fishermen balked at the law and unsuccessfully sought
an injunction to block the requirement for monitors. An attorney
for the Association of At-Sea Crab Processors said Thursday that
the refusal to grant the injunction this week was not appealed, and
processors were preparing to carry monitors.
   Attorney Mike Stanley of Juneau estimated that contractors who
provide the monitors will pass on about $9,000 in costs to each
processor required to use one.

Skills</HEAD>

   The four anti-apartheid
activists who have taken refuge in the U.S. consular offices are
testing the diplomatic skills of their hosts.
   Since the first three activists escaped 12 days ago to consular
sanctuary 11 stories above downtown Johannesburg, the activists
have demanded the release of all detainees and an end to South
Africa's state of emergency.
   The white-dominated South African government, in contrast to its
usual confrontational tactics, has waged a public relations
campaign to make itself appear reasonable.
   It says the first escapees _ well-known anti-apartheid leaders
who were in custody at least 14 months without charge _ are free to
walk away without fear of arrest.
   ``They are free men and we have no further interest in them
whatsoever,'' said Leon Mellet, the Law and Order Ministry
spokesman.
   Police say the fourth man, who escaped last Wednesday, faces a
possible charge of illegal weapons possession.
   Each of the four escaped from Johannesburg Hospital, where
police kept them under guard through use of national emergency laws
that give authorities powers to limit, among other things, freedom
of speech, press and assembly.
   So far, U.S. diplomats have said the activists can remain
indefinitely, but they also have barred them from direct contact
with journalists.
   John Dugard, a human rights lawyer in Johannesburg, supported
the activists' demand for written assurances they will not be
harmed but doubted the government would hold to its pledge to leave
them alone.
   ``I don't believe that for a moment,'' Dugard said. ``But it
might be argued that by staying in the consulate they are
restricting themselves.''
   Mellet said, ``Tthe three have become an embarrassment not only
for themselves, but for the Americans as well.''
   South African officials have issued one mild complaint about the
U.S. decision to provide temporary refuge, but stronger comments
have come from black activist Winnie Mandela and Sen. Edward
Kennedy.
   Kennedy said Thursday in Washington the escapees ``provide
compelling evidence that the people of South Africa, in their
struggle to end apartheid, still look to the American people for
support.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa, senior
leaders of the banned United Democratic Front, a nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned
National Education Crisis Committee.
   They were joined Wednesday by Clifford Ngcobo, an activist from
Soweto who alleges he was assaulted by police following his
detention in April.
   This is the first publicized sanctuary case at a U.S. mission in
South Africa, although there have been comparable cases at other
missions.
   Six activists stayed at the British Consulate in Durban for
several weeks in 1984 before emerging to face arrest for high
treason. The charges later were withdrawn.
   In 1987, South Africa allowed a Dutchman, Klaus de Jonge, to
return to the Netherlands after being holed up in a Dutch Embassy
office in Pretoria for two years. De Jonge escaped into the office
after being arrested for aiding the outlawed African National
Congress.
   The U.S. Embassy has expressed ``high regard'' for the activists
and promised they would not be forced out of the consulate, but
subsequent U.S. statements have been politically neutral,
belittling neither the activists nor South African authorities.
   Edward Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
has engaged in behind-the-scenes negotiations about the standoff
but has made no public comments, in keeping with the low profile he
has maintained throughout his two years here.
   Supporters of the escapees, while grateful for the sanctuary at
the consulate, have voiced annoyance at the Americans' efforts to
minimize controversy.
   Said Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela: ``We would like to see the Americans a
little more committed than they are.''
   One U.S. official said the Americans relieved because the
criticism from militants ``could have been a lot stronger.''

   An uneasy cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war
has held for more than a month despite daily claims of violations
by both sides.
   Although the guns have fallen silent after one of the longest
conventional wars this century, both sides remain on a war footing
and the bloodshed continues as they turn on internal opponents to
settle old scores.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told his countrymen Aug. 30 that
``we must take it that we are still at war,'' and urged them to man
the frontlines against ``constant plots ... by our enemies.''
   Diplomats say Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who used the war
to consolidate his power and eliminate any challenges, will have to
keep the lid on tight to curb any dissent that might emerge.
   He has already taken advantage of the Aug. 20 cease-fire to turn
his army toward the long-rebellious Kurdish guerrillas who fought
on Iran's side.
   The autonomy-seeking Kurds say the Iraqis have killed at least
4,300 civilians in poison gas attacks in a major offensive in
northern Iraq. The guerrillas say it is aimed at wiping out Kurdish
resistance.
   Iran's sudden acceptance on July 18 of the U.N. cease-fire has
intensified political friction between rival factions in Tehran.
   That is part of a power struggle that has been building up over
who will take power when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, 88 and
reported ailing, dies.
   Not all Iranian leaders, particularly hard-line radicals, wanted
to end the war. Many Iranians were bewildered by Tehran's sudden
turnaround after eight years of sacrifice, destruction and more
than 1 million casualties.
   Khomeini, who said that endorsing the cease-fire was ``more
deadly than poison,'' clearly sought to head off a political
backlash by defending government leaders.
   ``They enjoy my confidence,'' he said. ``Do not blame them for
the decision which they have adopted. For them, too, such a
suggestion has been difficult and unpalatable.''
   Philip Robbins, an Iran specialist with London's Royal Institute
for International Affairs, said that with the cease-fire, unity in
Iran ``is likely to disappear.''
   With peace talks in Geneva stalled by the deep distrust and
hatred between Iran and Iraq, some Western analysts fear the
conflict could flare up again if negotiations do not produce a
comprehensive settlement.
   Neither side has made any move to demobilize their armies.
Iran's official media reports almost daily that fresh units of
volunteers have been sent to the front.
   Diplomats in Baghdad say the Iraqis remain deeply skeptical of
Iran's acceptance of the cease-fire after a year of prevaricating
and believe Tehran is only buying time to rebuild its forces for
another round of fighting.
   Analysts believe Iran would need at least two years to do that.
They said that when the fighting stopped, Iran was desperately
short of aircraft, tanks, tank engines and even artillery shells.
   Iran accepted the cease-fire only after Baghdad, in a chain of
lightning offensives between April and July, recaptured all the
land Iran had seized in the previous six years.
   That robbed Tehran of an important bargaining chip in peace
negotiations and left the Iranian military in disarray.
   Don Kerr, an analyst with the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies, said in a telephone interview:
``While the talks go on, the Iranians are regrouping and rearming
their forces as best they can.
   ``If they see no particular indications that the truce will do
something for them, I'd expect to see them starting up the war
again somehow.''
   But that may depend on who comes out on top in Tehran. At
present, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who seeks to end
Iran's self-imposed isolation, appears to have the upper hand.
   But he is opposed by hardliners led by Prime Minister Hussein
Musavi and Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who fear the
truce has weakened Iran's revolution.

   Iraq claims it won the Persian Gulf war
with Iran, but officials increasingly suspect they are losing the
peace.
   A string of Iraqi battlefield victories this year devastated
Iran's war machine and apparently forced the Islamic Republic to
accept a U.N. cease-fire it had rejected for nearly a year.
   But Iraq's demand for a permanent settlement of the 8-year-old
conflict is stalled in U.N.-mediated peace talks. International
condemnation of Iraq's alleged use of outlawed chemical weapons
against Kurdish rebels has put the oountry on the diplomatic
defensive.
   ``The present situation is in Iran's favor, not Iraq's,''
Defense Minister Adnan Khairallah complained last week during a
news conference with foreign reporters last week. Diplomats agree.
   ``The only card they have on the Iranians is military advantage
... and how do they use it?'' one Western diplomat commented.
``They're in a dilemma.''
   Iraq claims Iran does not want peace, just a breathing space to
rebuild its army before resuming efforts to spread its Islamic
revolution.
   The no-peace, no-war situation also leaves Iraq unable to use
its only seaports _ deeply frustrating Iraqi rulers who have made
renewed shipping a priority.
   Iraqi suspicions were roused by Iran's wartime vows to spread
its fundamentalist revolution throughout the Moslem world and by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's remark that accepting the cease-fire
was ``more deadly to me than poison.''
   Ironically, Iraq and its Arab allies demanded the U.N.
cease-fire measure when Iraq was on the defensive and Iranian
troops were hammering at the southern port city of Basra.
   Between April and July, Iraqi troops recaptured all the
territory they had lost to the Iranians over the previous six years
and even pushed into Iran. They claimed to have captured half of
Iran's tank force.
   Iraqi negotiators headed to the U.N.-sponsored peace talks in
Geneva vowing to negotiate on the basis of victory. But their
efforts to capitalize on military success has been frustrated.
   ``The Iranians have given nothing, absolutely zero'' at the
peace talks, the Western diplomat said.
   The talks have bogged down over Iraq's demand that its two
southern ports be put back in business immediately and that
sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the southern border
between the two countries, be renegotiated.
   Silt and the hulks of half-sunken ships block both the ports at
Basra and Umm Qasr, which lies west of the Shatt-al-Arab, and the
political deadlock is delaying the lengthy task of clearing them.
   Khairallah said that leaves Iran free to use its other ports
further south down the gulf, while Iraq is deprived of its own, a
situation that leaves Iraq worse off than it was before the war
broke out in September 1980.
   President Saddam Hussein said recently that if Iraq cannot use
its ports, Iran should not be able to use its ports.
   Khairallah said that while renewed warfare was unlikely, if the
deadlock in talks persists, ``this might lead to fighting.''
   The cease-fire also gave Iraq a free hand against Kurdish
insurgents deprived of their Iranian ally.
   That Iraqi military operation against the Kurds succeeded, but
at the cost of rousing massive international condemnation of Iraq
over allegations it used chemical weapons.
   The criticism fueled Iraq's obsessive fear that the superpowers
and other nations will tilt their policies toward Iran, bolstering
its foe in future military or political clashes.
   The chemical weapons furor also threatens to torpedo improving
Iraqi relations with the United States and the West, which Iraq had
hoped can help rebuild it war-battered economy.
   Said one diplomat: ``They've just seen all that shot out from
under them.''

   The pro-democracy campaign has made daily
life a constant struggle in the capital, where residents try to
cope with trigger-happy soldiers and the spiraling price of the
staple food, rice.
   ``I lived in Rangoon before (World War II), during the war and
after the war up to now. This is the worst period in my life,''
said Aye Maung, about 65. ``Life in Rangoon is now like hell.''
   Residents have heard gunfire nearly every night _ presumably
soldiers fighting protesters _ since military commander Gen. Saw
Maung seized power one week ago.
   The government said 263 people, including 238 civilians, have
been killed since Sunday's coup. Western diplomats put the death
toll as high as 400.
   With soldiers, looters and others roaming the lawless streets,
residents have been cordoning off their homes, and few dare violate
the 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew.
   Even in daytime, ``people are afraid to go out for strolls,''
said one resident who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rangoon has not been Asia's most comfortable capital since Gen.
Ne Win ended Burmese democracy in a 1962 coup and began a ruinous
26-year path along the ``Burmese Way to Socialism.''
   Graceful buildings from the British colonial era have decayed
from neglect, the primitive transportation system was overtaxed and
only a thriving black market kept the economy afloat. A U.N. report
has described Rangoon as Asia's most rat-infested city.
   Ne Win resigned on July 23 after a wave of pro-democracy
demonstrations, and a quick succession of three new leaders long
associated with him has failed to quell the anti-government
sentiment.
   A general strike since Aug. 8 has closed most businesses and
paralyzed the government as civil servants symphathetic to the
protesters stayed off the job.
   Residents who have gone weeks without a paycheck are preoccupied
with scraping together enough money for rice.
   The price of a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of rice has tripled since
July to $2.50, forcing perhaps more than half of Rangoon
population's to eat rice porridge or sweet potatoes instead of rice.
   Gasoline prices have shot up as refineries closed and military
and government departments stock up. Virtually the only way to get
gasoline is through the black market. A gallon costs about $21,
five times the price in August.
   Ironically, the capital's supply of electricity has become less
erratic because government factories that are major users have been
shut by the general strike.
   All banks have been closed, so even the rich have problems
getting by. Hawkers of black market goods, who previously ran
thriving businesses, have trouble getting customers even with big
discounts. Other businessmen, such as small manufacturers and
repairmen, also find they no longer have a market for non-essential
goods and services.
   ``People don't come to repair their cars, there's no gasoline,''
said Chein, an automobile mechanic. ``I had to terminate the
services of my four assistants. I tried to sell my car at any price
because I need money, but nobody is buying. The car is now
useless.''
   Only small roadside foodstalls seem to be doing some business.
   Most popular forms of entertainment have disappeared. The
usually packed downtown cinemas have been eerily quiet since early
August, when troops fired on demonstrators in the area. Large
restaurants also are closed.
   State-run radio and television have featured military songs and
war documentaries since the coup Sunday, and popular American
television programs such as ``Starsky and Hutch'' and ``Hart to
Hart'' have been taken off the air.
   But some people say they will put up with the hardships in the
struggle for democracy.
   Sein Aye, who works at the government port authority, said he
last drew his $50 monthly salary in August. He says he will defy
the new government's orders to return to work by Oct. 3 _ on threat
of dismissal.
   ``I don't know whether I will get it this month with the banks
closed. With food prices rising and no security in town, life is
horrible,'' he said.
   ``But I won't go back to work, even if they sack me. I will get
it back when a new government comes.''

   Here is the text of the Democrats' response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address:
   This is Dale Bumpers, senator from Arkansas.
   Democracy only works if people demand an accounting of those
elected officials in whom they have placed their trust, based on
their promises. If we allow ourselves to be deceived, allow our
attention to be diverted, or simply engage in the cynicism that
political promises aren't made to be kept anyway, then we all lose.
   You recall Ronald Reagan's big promise in 1980, that he would
double defense spending, cut taxes by 30 percent and balance the
budget _ a broken promise.
   In 1984 they said, ``It's morning in America'' and it sure is.
Every morning the U.S. Treasury has to print $575 million in new
money just for interest to keep the government afloat that day. And
if you don't remember anything else I say, remember this: The
deficit will be $150 billion this year and $135 billion of that is
just for interest on that part of the national debt added by this
administration.
   Now comes George Bush betting he can fool 51 percent of
America's voters until election day, that they won't know or care
that today's prosperity has come at an unbelievable burden to our
children.
   And he wants more debt. He says he wants billions more to deal
with the drug problems, and you and I agree that the drug problem is
   enormous. But when you ask him where the money's coming from, he
says, ``Read my lips _ no new taxes.''
   He wants billions more for defense, including Star Wars at a
possible cost of $1 trillion, but when you ask where the money's
coming from he says, ``Read my lips.''
   After this administration steadfastly opposed a day care bill
that would give working mothers the peace of mind that comes from
knowing their children are well cared for while they're at work,
George Bush read the polls, saw the gender gap and quickly proposed
his own $2 billion day care bill. And when asked where the money
was coming from he said, ``Read my lips.''
   He says he wants to be known as an education president yet you
will remember this administration wanted to make ketchup a
vegetable on school lunches, and vigorously attacked student loans
and grants that give less fortunate children an opportunity for a
college education.
   Now George Bush holds himself out as an environmentalist and
conservationist. But where was he while this administration
indulged James Watt's ``rape, ruin and run'' policies until he
became an unbearable political burden. This administration just
discovered acid rain three months ago. For George Bush to pose as
an environmentalist is like Bonnie and Clyde posing as bank
examiners.
   George Bush says judgment is everything in the Oval Office, and
Democrats agree wholeheartedly. So when this country was secretly
selling arms to the Ayatollah and cynically warning every other
nation not to; while we were trying to ransom hostages with arms
and telling the world we'd never deal with terrorists; George Bush
sat in the Oval Office _ absolutely mute so far as we know.
   And our question of George Bush is, why didn't he pound the
table like George Shultz and Cap Weinberger who called it a
cockamamie idea?
   There are 240 million people in the United States, and only five
or six people thought selling arms to the Ayatollah was a good
idea, and they all just happened to be in the White House at the
same time.
   George Bush said Thursday in Boston that he would be tough on
crime, but he couldn't even hear the shredders in the basement of
the White House when they were running at white hot speed.
Apparently his toughness on crime will depend on who's committing
the crime.
   And when he told us he was liberated and was now his own man,
and made his own very first, unfettered decision, he chose J.
Danforth Quayle as his running mate. And that decision speaks
volumes about his judgment.
   The people of this nation know we have problems, and they're not
afraid to face them. George Bush says elect me and I'll give you
more of the same: more debt, more tax relief for the rich, less
income for working people.
   Michael Dukakis says he believes that men and women should be
allowed the dignity of a decent job, an affordable home in which to
raise their families, a clean environment, oceans free of
unspeakable trash, an educational system that will get us out of
last place in international competition, health care for the
have-nots, an end to the nuclear arms race and the beginning of a
strong national defense in fact _ not one just where the only
criterion is how much money we spend on it; not one where we buy
weapons whether we need them or not, or whether they work or not.
   Never in our history has this nation needed so much leadership
and received so little.
   We can deal with every one of our problems. I agree with Barry
Goldwater when he says George Bush ought to talk about the issues.
No problem has ever been solved by ignoring it, and no nation has
ever achieved greatness by electing those who would divide us on
the issue of who loves America more. And we'll never make it by
continuing to elect those who break their promises.
   So we Democrats plead with you, America _ don't read their lips
_ look at their record.

<HEAD>Widespread Thunderstorms Over Southern States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Thunderstorms erupted Saturday afternoon over northern Alabama
as showers ringed the Gulf Coast, but pleasant autumn weather
dominated from the Plains west to the Pacific Coast.
   Winds blew a tree onto a trailer near Madison, Ala., as low
pressure over northeast Arkansas moved slowly east and northeast
along a stationary front that extended from northeast Texas across
North Carolina.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along the Gulf Coast
from southeast Texas into northwest Florida, from southeast
Missouri across southern Illinois and Ohio, and were widespread
from the middle and lower Mississippi Valley into the lower Ohio
and Tennessee valleys. The heaviest rainfall was over western and
central Tennessee where 1 to 1{ inches of rain was measured
Saturday morning.
   Southeast winds off the Atlantic Ocean were producing showers
and thunderstorm across extreme southern Florida.
   Hurricane Helene was slowing down as it turned northward over
the open waters of the Atlantic, its center 890 miles east of
Antigua with sustained winds at 115 mph.
   From the Plains west to the Pacific Coast, skies were mostly
sunny and afternoon temperatures were in the 60s or 70s. Clouds and
light rain were hitting parts of Washington state ahead of a cold
front over the Pacific Ocean.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Olympia, Wash., and Arcata, Calif., to 94 degrees in
Florida at Orlando and Southwest Regional Airport in Fort Myers.
The low early Friday was 19 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Sunday's forecast called for widespread showers and
thunderstorms across the middle and southern Atlantic Coast regions
and inland across the central and southern Appalachians and in
parts of Upper Michigan. Widespread rain was expected over the
Pacific Northwest and the northern Plateau from a cold front
approaching from the west.
   High temperatures in the 70s or 80s were expected across much of
the nation. Highs in the 60s were forecast for the northern tier
from the northern Pacific Coast across the northern Plateau, the
northern rockies, the northern Plains, the northern Great Lakes
region and northern New England into the mid Atlantic Coast. Highs
in the low or mid 90s were forecast for the southern half of Texas
and the western Gulf Coast, southern Alabama, southern Georgia and
the northern half of Florida with mid or upper 90s expected in the
desert Southwest.
