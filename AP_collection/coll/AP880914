   The Supreme Court late Wednesday granted a
temporary stay of execution to a 28-year-old murderer convicted in
a convenience store robbery that netted him and a co-defendant $24,
a court spokeswoman said.
   ``The full court granted the stay'' for Warren Bridge at 11:10
p.m. EDT, about two hours after his attorney filed the application,
said spokeswoman Toni House. Bridge's execution by lethal injection
had been scheduled for after 1 a.m. EDT Thursday.
   Bridge was convicted for the 1980 shooting of Walter Rose, 62.
   The court granted the temporary stay pending a timely filing of
a request for a full review of the case by the court, she said.

   The U.S. Supreme Court granted a
temporary stay of execution Wednesday night for a 28-year-old
murderer who was scheduled to die by injection for a fatal
convenience story holdup that netted $24.
   Warren Bridge's execution, scheduled for after 1 a.m. EDT
Thursday, was stayed by the full court, spokeswoman Toni House said.
   The court granted the temporary stay pending a timely filing of
a request for a full review of the case by the court, she said.
   A federal district judge in Galveston had refused to stay
Bridge's execution for for the 1980 shooting of Walter Rose, 62, in
a convenience store robbery. Bridge's lawyer then took his case to
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Bridge would have been the 102nd inmate executed nationally, and
the 28th in Texas, since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1976
allowing states to resume the use of the death penalty.
   Galveston attorney Anthony Griffin contended in his appeal that
during the punishment phase of Bridge's murder trial, jurors were
not allowed to consider mitigating circumstances, or facts that
might have led them to settle on a lesser punishment.
   Griffin cited arguments used in an appeal filed on behalf of
Texas death row inmate Johnny Penry, whose case the U.S. Supreme
Court has agreed to hear.
   After his arrest for the shooting, Bridge escaped briefly from
the Galveston County Jail by knocking out a hole in the jail wall.
He was captured 19 hours later hitchhiking along a freeway.
   Rose was shot four times with a .38-caliber pistol as Bridge and
his co-defendant, Robert Joseph Costa, robbed the convenience store
of $24 on Feb. 10, 1980. Rose died of his wounds on Feb. 24, 1980,
four days after Bridge and Costa were arrested.
   Costa was convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to 13
years in prison. He was released under mandatory supervision in
October 1986 after serving five years and eight months in prison.
   Bridge, a native of Fauquier County, Va., said he was in trouble
since he was 8. He grew up in Albany, Ga., and before moving to
Texas, he served 13 months of a 15-year prison term for burglary in
Georgia.
   Bridge said in a recent interview that he was sorry Rose died,
but complained his life on death row was worse than the shooting
victim's fate.
   ``I sit here on death row for 7{ years and think about dying,
and I believe Mr. Rose got a better deal,'' he said. ``I keep
wishing they would hurry up and do something. I tell you, this
place will drive you crazy.''
   During his time on death row, Bridge was implicated in the
bombing of another inmate's cell and the non-fatal stabbing of a
second inmate in incidents blamed on prison gang warfare. Bridge
also was linked to membership in the Aryan Brotherhood, a white
supremacist prison gang.
   ``I'm not affiliated,'' he said in the interview. ``I'm friends
with everybody. And now I've got a black attorney. It's a touchy
subject.''

   Solidarity's Lech Walesa appeared to stand
firm Wednesday on the issue of legalizing his federation, on the
eve of a second preparatory meeting with authorities before talks
on Poland's future.
   ``There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' he told reporters
upon arriving in Warsaw from his home in Gdansk.
   Walesa refused to confirm he will be meeting with communist
authorities on Thursday. When pressed for comment on the talks, the
leader of the outlawed free trade union movement replied, ``We will
know more tomorrow.''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said a meeting of Walesa,
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak and two or three other
people would take place at noon Thursday to resolve obstacles to
convening the talks.
   Walesa said he planned to remain in Warsaw through Friday before
departing for the southern city of Czestochowa to attend a workers'
pilgrimage over the weekend at the Jasna Gora monastery.
   Elsewhere, members of the official union for transport workers
in Gdynia idled bus and streetcar service in that Baltic port city
of 250,000 for about six hours Wednesday to protest their pay, a
union spokesman said.
   Walesa earlier this month ended a series of Solidarity-led
strikes in exchange for the promise of talks on the federation's
future.
   But the brief Gdynia stoppage was mounted by an official trade
union created after Solidarity was outlawed in 1982.
   Regional official union spokesman Stanislaw Koscielak said the
transport workers want a pay increase of $6 a month which they were
promised last year but never received. Average pay nationwide is
about $100 monthly.
   Koscielak claimed the strike was legal under a 1982 law that
allows strikes after a period of negotiation and arbitration. A
spokesman at the main depot, who refused to give his name, said
drivers began striking at 5 a.m. but went back to work at 11 a.m.
   The official trade union alliance, known by its Polish initials
OPZZ, has been pressing the government to liberalize the laws on
the right to strike. It has complained that denying official unions
the strike weapon undermines their credibility with workers.
   The government acknowledges widespread worker unhappiness. This
year's inflation rate has climbed to 60 percent, with supplies of
consumer goods to stores even more erratic than usual because of
increased exports to offset Poland's $39 billion foreign debt.

   Gilbert, an ``extremely dangerous hurricane'' and one of the
strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.
   The hurricane killed at least five people Sunday in the
Dominican Republic, civil defense officials said. Six people died
and 60,000 were left homeless in Jamaica on Monday, officials there
said.
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga said the hurricane swept the full
length of Jamaica, ``leaving a trail of wreckage behind it.''
   ``It will take us some time before we can assess the full damage
without any doubt,'' Seaga said in a statement. ``But I have no
doubt that this going to be the worst disaster that we have
experienced in our modern history.''
   Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and the
death toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage and
casualty reports.
   The hurricane, traveling westward across the Caribbean Sea, was
upgraded Tuesday to a Category 5, the strongest and deadliest type
of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than
155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla., described Gilbert as ``a great hurricane ... in the
top 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity, size and
destructive potential.''
   Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ a
1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida, and Hurricane
Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed
256 people.
   ``The people who need to be concerned now are those people over
on the Yucatan Peninsula _ Cancun, Cozumel, that whole area,''
Sheets said.
   Mexico's news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated in
the Yucatan resorts of Cancun and Cozumel Island.
   They gave no figures on the numer of evacuees, but said people
in Cancun were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center,
about 6 miles away.
   Cozumel is south of Cancun and the reports said hotel guests
also were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline.
   Mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morning
hours Wednesday.
   At midnight EDT the U.S. National Weather Service said Gilbert
was centered near latitude 19.9 north, longitude 84.8 west, or
about 150 miles east-southeast of Cozumel.
   It said Gilbert was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph with
maximum sustained winds of 175 mph. The center said tropical
storm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles to the north and
200 miles to the south of the center.
   ``People in the warned areas should have completed all possible
preparations for this extremely dangerous hurricane,'' it said.
   The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure. It said by 8 p.m. EDT it
was measured at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded
for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
   ``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western
Hemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
   ``There is very serious flooding'' in the Cayman Islands, Erina
Nichols, a tourism official in Miami, said Tuesday after speaking
with residents of the islands. ``The Run Point (community) is
taking a real beating.''
   The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the Cayman
Islands, a British dependency of 23,000 people that was expecting
12-foot tides.
   Warren Chase, an amateur radio operator in Fort Myers, Fla.,
said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboard
missing near the Cayman Islands.
   Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the
Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
   Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.
in Lafayette, La., said his company's 18 helipads were working at
full capacity to evacuate about 10,000 oil rigs in the Gulf of
Mexico.
   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said 40,000 people, many of
them foreign vacationers and students, were evacuated Tuesday from
the Isle of Youth off the southwestern coast as the hurricane
passed 200 miles to the south.
   In New York City, a ham radio operator who was monitoring
amateur radio communications in Jamaica said Tuesday, ``Kingston is
devastated, Montego Bay is hit hard and Ocho Rios is flooded.
   The operator, Norm Chwat, an officer with the American Red Cross
Radio Club, said therth coast had been wrecked by the
hurricane.
   Herb Schoenbaum, a radio ham operator in the Virgin Islands,
said he spoke Tuesday with Dave Porter, an American staying in the
Wyndham Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay. ``Porter reported that the
hotel `peeled apart like a banana' when the force of Hurricane
Gilbert hit last night,'' Schoenbaum said.
   ``This morning he says there is just nothing left. Boats that
were on the beach, the little rental Sailfishes or Sunfishes, were
driven into cars like spears _ power lines down, almost every tree
in the area is on the ground.''
   Schoenbaum said Porter told him people who were trying to enter
the hotel on their hands and knees at the height of the storm were
swept into the ocean.
   Glenn Baxter of Belgrade Lakes, Me., said he spoke with a ham
operator in Jamaica who told him the roof of a hospital in
Mandeville ripped off ``and the hospital has caved in. And that is
the worst horror show that I've heard about because that would
imply that a lot of people could have been hurt.''
   The Jamaican consulate in Miami said today it had n immediate
information on the extent of damages or casualties.
   Jamaica was still out of contact with the rest of the world by
telephone.
   Roger Myers, southern regional spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Atlanta, said both international
airports in Jamaica are closed. ``We've been told the government
has asked commercial radio stations to remain silent so Radio
Jamaica can broadcast information,'' Myers said.

<HEAD>Report Says Covert Operatives Boosted Reagan's Central American
Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House staff report says U.S. experts in
covert intelligence and psychological operations exceeded their
authority in helping rally public support for President Reagan's
Central America policies.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee staff said Tuesday these
operatives ``conspired, through the staff of the National Security
Council, to use the State Department as a cover for a domestic
operation which went far beyond the legal and ethical scope of
their authority.''
   Individuals and organizations working in the 1983-86 operation
raised and spent money to influence congressional votes and the
U.S. news media, the report said.
   The ``domestic political and propaganda operation'' was run
through the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin
America and the Caribbean, known as ``S@LPD,'' according to the
committee's chief counsel, R. Spencer Oliver, and staff consultant
Bert Hammond.
   The office reported directly to the National Security Council
rather than through the normal State Department channels, a system
established over the objections of Secretary of State George P.
Shultz.
   The staff report said many of the activities on behalf of
Reagan's Central American policies were carried out by recipients
of no-bid contracts ``hidden from public view.''
   Some of the organizations with no-bid contracts also were part
of former NSC aide Oliver L. North's secret program to raise money
for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. North used these fund-raising
efforts along with funds diverted from U.S. arms sales to Iran in
an elaborate scheme to aid the Contras at time when Congress had
banned such aid.
   Reagan, when asked about the report by reporters Tuesday, held
his thumb and forefinger about an inch apart to show how much
attention he thought the study deserved.
   ``One day, I promise you, in a paragraph only about that long,
I'm going to tell you the truth about Iran-Contra, as I did when it
first came to light and which no one is reporting today,'' he said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated that Reagan
may write more than a paragraph. Calling the allegations ``old
hat,'' Fitzwater said the president plans to tell his side of the
Iran-Contra affair in a book that Reagan will author after leaving
office.
   ``He feels it has been told, but that it just keeps coming up
over and over again and people forget the original answers and the
original investigations,'' the spokesman said.
   The report did not cite any laws or presidential directives that
were violated, and it was not endorsed by the Foreign Affairs
Committee members. It was sent to the panel's chairman, Dante B.
Fascell, D-Fla.
   Hammond said the committee staff has asked the Congressional
Research Service of the Library of Congress to investigate whether
the operation violated laws restricting CIA domestic activities;
government lobbying; and use of appropriated money for domestic
propaganda purposes.
   While many of the activities of the Office of Public Diplomacy
have been reported extensively in the past, the new study
emphasized the role of intelligence experts applying their craft in
a domestic operation, instead of the foreign covert operations for
which they were trained.
   A presidential executive order on intelligence activities says
U.S. covert operations cannot include an effort to influence the
public opinion or public policy of the United States.
   While the transfer of intelligence operatives to domestic
agencies is not improper under the order, the activities they
perform could violate the order, according to congressional
intelligence experts.
   The report said Donald Gregg, a former high-ranking CIA official
who is now national security adviser to Vice President George Bush,
initiated the recommendation that led to the assignment of former
CIA propaganda expert Walter Raymond Jr. to the NSC group that
directed the public diplomacy office.
   Bush, the GOP presidential nominee, has been questioned during
the campaign about his role as chief of a Reagan administration
task force on Central America policy and his association with Gregg.
   Raymond, according to the report, ``was instrumental in
facilitating the assignment of intelligence personnel from the
Department of Defense to S@LPD and the expansion of State
Department resources available to S@LPD,'' the report said.
   ``On one occasion,'' the report said, ``five intelligence
experts from the Army's 4th Psychological Operations Group at Fort
Bragg, N.C.'' were assigned to work with the office, then headed by
Otto Reich, the current U.S. ambassador to Venezuela.

<HEAD>White House Aide Wary Of Proposed Labeling Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department wants to change the
rules governing the labels on American hot dogs but is proceeding
over the objections of a White House regulatory official.
   Department officials thought a proposal to allow processors to
include salvaged meat and ground bone in their recipes without
explicitly noting the contents in product labels would be in line
with President Reagan's policy of stripping away some of the layers
of federal regulation.
   The proposal would allow up to 10 percent mechanically reclaimed
meat and tiny bone chips in hot dogs and a number of similar items
without explicitly noting the contents in product labels.
   When animals are slaughtered, most of the red meat is cut or
scraped from bones by hand. But a lot of edible tissue clings to
the bones and gristle, particularly in neck bones, ribs, joints and
other hard-to-scrape places.
   The bones and the attached meat remnants are put through a
grinder and forced through fine sieves. Although most of the bones
are strained out, the resulting mixture still contains bits of bone
about the size of ground pepper.
   Under current regulations, the salvaged meat and bone chips are
allowed in up to 20 percent of the meat portion of these products,
but the labels must state that the products contain the reclaimed
mixture.
   The mixture is known as ``mechanically separated'' meat, or MSM,
although current regulations describe it as MS(S) to acknowledge
the species of animal involved. Thus, salvaged meat from a hog
would be mechanically separated pork, or MSP.
   According to a group of meat processors who asked USDA for the
rule change, no company at present is commercially producing MS(S)
for consumer products because of ``unwarranted negative
connotations'' associated with the term MS(S).
   The USDA plan did not set well with Jay Plager, administrator of
information and regulatory affairs in the Office of Management and
Budget. He told USDA in a letter on Aug. 19 that the proposed rule
change ``does not appear to be consistent with several of the
administration's basic regulatory principles.''
   Plager added: ``Nor does it appear that the potential benefits
to society of this regulation outweigh the potential cost to
society.''
   Christopher Hicks, the USDA's general counsel, replied that
department officials ``do not agree with the conclusions'' set
forth by Plager.
   ``There are compelling reasons for proposing this rule,
including the fact that it may produce benefits to society that
outweigh societal costs,'' Hicks told Plager in a Sept. 6 letter.
   Copies of the letters by Plager and Hicks were provided to The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
   Advocates of the rule change contend that consumers won't buy
products containing the salvaged material if labels inform them
about it.
   The proposal, which began a 60-day rulemaking procedure on Sept.
9, was announced on Monday by the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service.
   Under various names, MS(S) has been authorized for use in the
meat products since 1978 and has undergone numerous legal
challenges from consumer groups opposed to the salvaged product
itself or labeling requirements.
   According to the plan, which will be open for public comment
until Nov. 8, processors would be able to use MS(S) to comprise up
to 10 percent of the meat in franks, bologna, luncheon meats,
sausage and similar products without stating so on product labels.
   However, the label would have to indicate the percentage of the
Recommended Daily Allowance of calcium that the product contained.
Calcium is a primary ingredient of bone tissue.
   The American Meat Institute, a private association that
represents meat packers and processors, said in a statement that
the use of calcium on labels would be ``a more meaningful and
useful term'' to consumers than MS(S), particularly to those who
have a calcium deficiency and to a few who are allergic to calcium
and should be warned away from such products.
   In its brief statement, the institute said, ``There is no
wholesomeness or safety issue involved'' in the MS(S) proposal.
   But Plager said the assertion that consumers would avoid
products labeled as containing MS(S) had not been documented in the
proposed rule change.
   ``Furthermore, if one accepts the assertion that some consumers
would be reluctant to purchase a product that they know to contain
MS(S), why should this information be omitted from the label?'' he
said.
   Plager said that in seeking ways to carry out less burdensome
food safety regulations, ``We must also provide consumers with
more, rather than less, information about food products so that
they may reach informed market decisions.''

<HEAD>Hispanic Candidates Making Gains In Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanic candidates continued to make gains in
local, state and federal elections this year and now hold 3,360
elective positions nationwide, said a report released today.
   The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials said the number of Hispanic elected officials increased
by 1.3 percent this year, based on elections from August 1987 to
August 1988.
   Harry Pachon, national director of the association, said
measuring the number of Hispanic elected officials ``is a good
barometer of Hispanic progress in the political arena.'' The
association is a non-partisan, non-profit research organization
with more than 3,300 members.
   President Reagan on Tuesday proclaimed this week as National
Hispanic Heritage Week, saying people of Hispanic descent have
``written countless chapters in the unique saga of the United
States.''
   Most of the Hispanic elected officials hold municipal and school
board seats. Association researcher Luis Baquedano said a breakdown
of party membership was not available because many local officials
do not run as Democrats or Republicans.
   The association said the largest gains were made in the
Southwest, with Texas accounting for 1,611 of the elected officials
and New Mexico coming in second with 595. Texas has the nation's
second-largest Hispanic population, with 4.1 million of the
nation's estimated 19.4 million Hispanics.
   California, with the country's largest Hispanic population at
6.6 million, had 466 Hispanic elected officials.
   New York, with a third-ranked Hispanic population of 2.1
million, had 68 elected Latino leaders, fewer than states with
smaller Hispanic populations such as Arizona, with 237 elected
officials, and Colorado with 157.
   Other states with double-digit numbers of elected Hispanics were
Florida, 50; New Jersey, 44; Illinois, 28; Connecticut, 15; and
Washington, 12.
   Hispanics hold 11 seats in the U.S. House but none in the
Senate. There is one Hispanic governor, Bob Martinez of Florida.

   An independent education group says its survey
of American schools and education officials indicates there is no
shortage of qualified teachers despite frequent talk to the
contrary.
   ``The facts are that there is no teacher shortage,'' C. Emily
Feistritzer of the National Center for Education Information said
Tuesday.
   She said the group's ``Teacher Supply and Demand Surveys 1988''
report shows that not only is the alleged teacher shortage
unsubstantiated, the teaching market was glutted, with some school
districts maintaining large applicant lists.
   The center's surveys, conducted June 28-Aug. 28, were directed
at teacher certification and education offices across the nation,
75 school districts, and more than 1,000 individuals who had been
seeking teaching jobs.
   The National Education Association disputed the results, with
NEA spokesman Howard Carroll saying past NEA surveys indicated that
vacancies reported during the summer months usually were not filled
by new full-time hires in September.
   ``These school districts say they hired temporaries, or
substitutes, reassigned teachers' aides, misassigned teachers,
eliminate or reduce course offerings,'' he said. ``We generally
find that 20 percent of the schools will increase class size.''
   ``This is merely a smokescreen to mask the hiring of temporaries
and uncertified teachers,'' he said.
   Feistritzer said the state boards maintained that all their
teachers were certified and noted that many had a policy of placing
all new hires on a probationary or temporary status.
   She acknowledged that the surveys found a shortage in bilingual
and special education teachers, but ascribed the outcry over a
teacher shortage partly to political considerations.
   ``As long as you keep presenting a crisis, you've got control
over what happens to solve it,'' she said. ``And I do think the
unions have held onto this prediction _ it does give them control
over who gets into the profession.''
   The center's surveys also found:
   _Teachers are not leaving the profession at the rate predicted
and many who left the field are trying to re-enter. It cited
American Federation of Teachers data showing a decrease in
retirements from 2.4 percent in 1985-86 to 2.2 percent in 1986-87.
AFT figures also indicated that 53 percent of new hires in 1987-88
were re-entering teachers, up from the 50 percent in 1986-87.
   _Data from the school districts indicate that recent college
graduates comprise 50 percent to 60 percent of applicants for
teaching positions, at least 20 percent are former teachers trying

<HEAD>Kemp To Join Think Tank But Says He's Not Leaving Politics
Completely</HEAD>

   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York says his decision
to join a conservative think tank in January when he leaves
Congress doesn't mean he's leaving politics completely.
   The nine-term GOP congressman, who earlier had said he would not
seek a 10th House term, said Tuesday his position as a
distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation would be ``another
phase'' in his career.
   ``I'm not going to be in public office but I will be doing
things before (congressional) committees, lecturing, writing,
speaking and staying active in support of those policies and issues
and ideas that I have been associated with for a number of years,''
he said.
   Kemp, who for nearly 18 years has represented New York's 31st
Congressional District around Buffalo, announced earlier this year
that he would retire from Congress at the end of this term. At the
time, he was waging an unsuccessful bid for the Republican
presidential nomination.
   He was mentioned as a possible running mate for George Bush and
made no secret of the fact that he would accept the job gladly.
Bush instead selected Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   Kemp said he would keep his political action committee running
so he will have a hand in helping the candidates he supports. He
also plans to continue working for Bush's presidential campaign,
``and then see what happens.''
   ``I expect that Bush will win, and what the future holds, I
don't know,'' he said. ``But I think this is a good place from
which to be active in public policy and keep my options open. So
I'm not ruling anything in or out.''
   Kemp, 53, in the past has been a guest lecturer at the
foundation and has written articles for the foundation's quarterly
journal, Policy Review. The fellowship is slated to last at least
two years, he said.
   Kemp is a former all-pro quarterback for the San Diego Chargers
and the Buffalo Bills. He first won his congressional seat in 1970.
   In Congress, he became the architect of many economic proposals,
including the 1981 supply-side tax cuts, urban enterprise zones and
a bill passed last year that enables inner-city poor people living
in public housing to purchase their apartments.

<HEAD>Reagan Agrees To Send U.N. Past-Due American Dues Payments</HEAD>

   President Reagan is releasing $188 million in
overdue U.S. payments to the United Nations after becoming
convinced that the world body has reformed some administrative and
budgetary procedures.
   At the same time, the White House said Reagan told the State
Department to work out ``a multi-year'' repayment plan involving
some $520 million in arrearages that have piled up in recent years
because of U.S. dissatisfaction with the way the U.N. was run.
   ``In announcing these decisions, the president called on the
United Nations to continue progress in areas where reform remains
incomplete,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Tuesday.
   ``The president reiterated the commitment of the U.S. to assist
the U.N. in its reform program as well as in its new peace keeping
efforts,'' he said.
   In addition to the roughly $520 million in late dues payments,
the United States is in arrears to the tune of $111.8 million in
the assessments it is supposed to pay toward the separate U.N.
peace keeping budget.
   The United States pays 25 percent of the cost of running the
United Nations, and 31 percent of the cost of the peace keeping
operations.
   Reagan is scheduled to visit the United Nations for two days
later this month, and will address the General Assembly on Sept.
26. He also will meet with a number of foreign leaders while in New
York.
   Considering the financial burden the United States shoulders for
the United Nations, both the administration and a majority in
Congress have concluded there has been too little accountability
from the U.N.
   But Fitzwater said the U.N. ``has made progress'' toward
streamlining and improving budget-making procedures and cracking
down on the hiring of temporary employees for the secretariat. He
also said that where U.S. interests are concerned, the ``political
environment'' had improved.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told reporters as
he left U.N. headquarters in New York that Reagan's decision ``is a
very positive development which I very much welcome and which
alleviates our difficulties. Of course, it is not the end of our
financial problems, but it will alleviate them very much.''
   In an earlier statement issued on his behalf, Perez de Cuellar
said, ``Until the outstanding contributions by all member states
are paid, the organization will continue to operate with inadequate
current income and virtually without reserves.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said Reagan's actions ``breathe new life into
our hopes for world peace.''
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said, ``The Reagan decision appears to signal a new era
of cooperation rather than confrontation with the United Nations.
The only question is whether Congress has the vision and the
fortitude to reverse course and follow the president's lead.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan ``will release $44 million, which was
withheld in fiscal 1988, and $144 million which was withheld in
fiscal 1989. He will request full funding of the United Nations in
fiscal 1990, which amounts to approximately $476 million.''
   The $44 million will be released immediately, Fitzwater said,
while the $144 million that had been earmarked in fiscal 1989,
beginning Oct. 1, will be set free after the first of next month.
   The spokesman noted that Congress required the president to
determine that the United Nations had made reforms, ``including
cutbacks in the (U.N.) secretariat, the hiring of temporary
employees'' and improved budgeting procedures.
   Fitzwater said Reagan was convinced that the United Nations had
made progress in instituting reforms and that the president noted
the increasing peace keeping role of the world body in such hot
spots as Afghanistan, Namibia and the Persian Gulf.
   ``We have seen in the last six months some important reforms in
terms of the budget and hiring practices, and so forth, and so that
has been a determining factor,'' he said.
   ``During the seven and a half years of this administration, the
president has sought to change the political environment,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``Although the reform is incomplete, the progress is striking,''
he said.
   The aim, he said, was to ``prod the United Nations to become an
even greater force for peace throughout the world.''
   Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had
said in late July that the United States hoped to pay $188 million
of its debt to the United Nations before the year was out to help
prevent the world body from running out of money at a time of
heightened peace keeping activities.
   Testifying July 29 before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Walters said that if progress were reached at resolving
such world problems as Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the Cuban
presence in Angola, a transition to independence for Namibia and
theVietnamese occupation of Cambodia, the U.N. could face an annual
peace keeping bill of more than $1.5 billion.
   ``All of these are important to the interests of the United
States and all are likely to involve the United Nations
significantly,'' he said at the time. ``This increase in activity
takes place at a time when the U.N. is facing a very tight cash
situation.''

<HEAD>Senators Bow To Political Reality In Scrapping Medicaid Abortion
Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate abandoned an effort to expand
federal coverage for Medicaid abortions in the face of strong
opposition from the House and the White House.
   The Senate in July had voted 73-19 to allow federal financing
for Medicaid abortions for women who are victims of rape or incest,
but it backed down on Tuesday in a bow to political reality.
   Under current law, federal spending for Medicaid abortions is
permitted only if the procedure is needed to save a woman's life.
The House reaffirmed its support for that policy last week, and in
the process rejected the Senate's proposal for rape and incest
exceptions.
   President Reagan had promised to veto a $140 billion spending
bill containing all the fiscal 1989 money for the departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education if it came to him
with the Senate's abortion provision.
   The Senate on Tuesday voted 47-43 to kill a motion insisting on
the expanded Medicaid abortion coverage it had approved earlier.
   ``It's stand up and be counted time,'' said Sen. Lowell Weicker,
R-Conn., the chief proponent of expanded Medicaid coverage.
   ``We're going to see how politically expedient we want to be,''
added Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., sponsor of the provision adopted by
the Senate in July.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the subcommittee that
handled the spending bill, told his colleagues it would be futile
to resist the will of the House and White House.
   ``We're talking about a House that we're 50 votes short in.
We're talking about a president that's going to veto the bill.
We're talking about a clock that's ticking,'' Chiles said.
   Countered Exon: ``Sometimes I think we quiver and retreat all
too soon.''
   It took Chiles two tries to kill Weicker's motion insisting on
the Senate abortion position. He lost the first vote 46-44 but
prevailed on the second, 47-43.
   The outcome was hailed by the National Right-To-Life Committee
as ``a sharp setback for the pro-abortion movement'' and those
groups, who label themselves pro-choice, had to agree.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said ``politics played a heavy role'' in the
vote.
   ``Arms got twisted so that our friends voted against us,'' she
said. ``They deserted us in the interest of pragmatic politics.
It's clear they didn't want this bill to be held up.''
   ``We are terribly disappointed,'' said David Andrews, executive
director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ``These
are clearly cases that cry out for public funding.''
   Anti-abortion forces got a big boost last week from Reagan, who
wrote a letter to congressional leaders reiterating his veto threat.
   ``The Senate language would permit the use of federal funds for
the slaughter of unborn children, depriving the innocent of the
most basic of civil rights _ the right to life,'' Reagan said in
the letter. ``I urge the Congress to vote to protect the lives of
America's unborn children.''
   Weicker charged that the administration was trying ``to use
their last gasp and their last piece of political capital'' to deny
abortions to rape and incest victims.
   Fourteen states and the District of Columbia pay for Medicaid
abortions, but they receive federal reimbursement only in
life-threatening cases.

<HEAD>Rules On Underground Tanks Seek To Prevent Groundwater
Contamination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of operations, ranging
from corner service stations to giant oil companies, are being
subjected to the first federal rules aimed at preventing
contamination of groundwater by underground tanks.
   Almost 2 million tanks, roughly 97 percent of them holding
gasoline or some other petroleum product, are covered by a 370-page
set of regulations released Tuesday by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   The rules apply to new tanks starting in December, but give
owners until December 1998 to bring all existing tanks up to the
new standards.
   The rules require protection against corrosion, either
electrical devices or plastic liners for steel tanks or use of
non-steel tanks; leak detection systems, which may be inventory
record-keeping in some cases if an annual tightness test is
performed; and devices to prevent spills and overfilling.
   Existing tanks gradually will come under the regulations, the
oldest tanks first. Tanks that are 25 years old or of unknown age
will have to get a leak detection system by December 1989.
   Tanks may be exempted from the rules if a corrosion expert
certifies that they will not corrode in the particular soil they're
in, but EPA expects this to be rare.
   Home heating oil tanks and fuel tanks of less than 1,100 gallons
for non-commercial home or farm use are not covered.
   EPA surveys have shown that anywhere from 10 percent to 30
percent of the 750,000 installations with tanks are having or have
had a significant leak, and anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 tanks are
involved in some kind of cleanup project.
   Concerned that a gallon of gasoline can contaminate a million
gallons of groundwater, Congress in 1984 required the EPA to adopt
the regulations and two years later allocated $500 million to help
with cleanups.
   The agency said it tightened provisions for piping from an April
1987 draft because of growing evidence that many leaks start there,
rather than in the tank itself.
   However, environmental groups criticized the agency for failing
to require double-walled tanks or other double-barrier containment
systems for gasoline tanks. The agency specified their use only for
some 60,000 chemical tanks.
   ``It will cost a lot more to clean up after the fact than it
would to put in double-walled tanks to begin with,'' said Morgan
Gopnik, an engineer with the Environmental Action Foundation.
   ``EPA is leaving the U.S. supply of drinking water vulnerable to
petroleum contamination,'' said staff scientist Lois Epstein of the
Environmental Defense Fund.
   ``The regulations are designed to minimize their impact on the
regulated community, not to protect the environment and the public
from the hazards of petroleum contamination,'' she said.
   Although the agency didn't perform a cost-benefit calculation,
J. Winston Porter, assistant EPA administrator for solid waste and
emergency response, said that ``secondary containment is quite
expensive'' and would add unspecified billions to the cost of the
final regulations.
   ``Whether you're mom and pop or Exxon, it doesn't make a lot of
sense to keep a leaking gasoline tank in the ground. The liability
is enormous,'' Porter said.
   A service station with three 5,000-gallon tanks might have to
spend $3,000 to $8,000 on a leak detection system and $10,000 to
$48,000 on an electrical rust-prevention system, EPA estimated.
   The agency estimated the benefits from reduced spills in future
years at $73 billion in today's dollars, with costs to tank owners
at $54 billion.
   A dozen states have tank programs of their own, and any state
may operate a more stringent regulatory program than the national
rules if the EPA approves.
   The regulations become effective 90 days from publication in the
Federal Register, expected any day.

   As President Reagan follows Vice President
George Bush into Missouri, he is taking his campaign for the
Republican ticket to a state he carried narrowly in 1980 and
resoundingly four years ago.
   Reagan was flying today to Cape Girardeau, a shipping center on
the Mississippi River, for a rally at Southeast Missouri State
University, and then on to St. Louis to address 1,000 guests at a
$250-a-plate fund-raising dinner.
   ``The general thrust of both of these speeches is support for
the Republican ticket, acknowledgement of the economic successes of
this administration, discussion of the differences between liberals
and conservatives,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Tuesday.
   ``The first rally speech may focus a little more on the economy
and the second one a little more on military strength,'' the
spokesman said. ``But they will both be traditional political
speeches, covering the themes that the president has discussed in
the past.''
   The president plans one or two speaking forays each week until
the Nov. 8 election.
   GOP candidates who will benefit from the Missouri events include
Gov. John Ashcroft, seeking a second term against Democratic State
Rep. Betty Hearnes of Charleston, the wife of former Gov. Warren
Hearnes; and Sen. John Danforth, opposed by State Sen. Jay Nixon of
Hillsboro as he seeks his third term.
   Both Ashcroft and Danforth enjoy comfortable leads in state
public opinion polls.
   Bush, speaking Tuesday in Jefferson City, the state capital,
pledged, ``We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those
Democrats, Carter and Mondale, and who knows who else.''
   Reagan took Missouri's 11 electoral votes with 51 percent of the
popular vote against then-President Carter in 1980 and swept the
state with 60 percent of the popular vote against Walter Mondale in
1984.
   Records showed that the only incumbent president to visit Cape
Girardeau previously was William Howard Taft on Oct. 26, 1902.
Reagan will speak at the year-old Show Me Center.
   In St. Louis, the state's most populous city with a metropolitan
area population of more than 2 million, the president will speak at
the Omni Hotel St. Louis at an event for the Missouri GOP Victory
'88 fund.

   A new effort to end the impasse between the
United States and the Philippines over the terms of U.S. access to
strategic bases in the Philippines ended with no apparent narrowing
of differences.
   ``There has been nothing to justify my saying that we are closer
together,'' Philippines Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus told
reporters after a 45-minute meeting Tuesday with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz at the State Department.
   The major issue in the talks is U.S. compensation to the
Philippines for use of the bases.
   Manglapus, who also plans meetings with Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci and congressional leaders during his visit, said the two
sides are not far apart on a cash aid figure but that there has
been no agreement on other components of an aid package.
   Manglapus declined to provide details of the aid figures being
discussed but congressional sources and reports in the Philippines
indicated he is asking for about $1.2 billion annually over the
next two years.
   This would represent a sizeable increase over the $180 million a
year to which the Reagan administration has been committed since
1983. In addition to cash aid, the Philippines also is said to be
seeking trade concessions, debt relief and other ``soft
components,'' as Manglapus described them.
   The administration reportedly has offered $360 million yearly in
1989 and 1990 in addition to food assistance and other concessions
for a total of just under $500 million.
   Shultz said last week the Filipino demands were ``out of
bounds,'' adding that ``we will be patient and we will be
persistent'' in efforts to overcome the impasse.
   The State Department had no comment on the meeting with
Manglapus. The talks revolve around the terms for continued
American use of Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base, two of the
most important U.S. facilities outside the United States.
   The ongoing talks involve other issues, including the presence
of U.S. nuclear weapons at the bases, but most of the attention has
focused on compensation.
   Manglapus said a substantial aid increase is warranted partly to
correct what he suggested was a historical injustice, contending
that the United States used military facilities in the Philippines
for more than 70 years without compensating Filipino authorities.
   In other countries, he said, the United States has provided aid
immediately after establishing military bases.
   Manglapus said American analysts have concluded that the bases
benefit the United States more than the Philippines because ``there
is no external threat to the Philippines today.''

   Burl Ives the balladeer will become
Walt Whitman the poet during a one-man show that depicts the 19th
century literary master on the day after his 70th birthday.
   ``I would say he is the most singular man since Christ in his
work,'' Ives said in a recent interview. ``I believe he had that
kind of freedom, understanding and compassion. Emerson termed
`Leaves of Grass' the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom,
but the Victorian world wasn't ready for Whitman's celebration of
the human body and spirit.''
   Ives, 79, who won an Academy Award for best supporting actor for
``The Big Country'' in 1958, and wife, Dorothy, chose to write the
script for ``The Mystic Trumpeter _ Whitman at 70'' because they
were unable to find a playwright who was as familiar with Whitman's
works as they were.
   ``I have a feeling that we had little to do with creating this
play,'' Ives said. ``It was more instinct and feeling, and it just
dropped into place. I think we both got lots of help from the man
himself.''
   Ives, whose white-bearded appearance is strikingly similar to
Whitman's, begins his appearances as the poet Thursday at the
Lobero Theater here.

   Ashby Harper, who's held records as the
oldest to swim across the English Channel and around Manhattan, had
to stop a 19.1-mile ocean swim midway between Santa Catalina Island
and the mainland when he fell ill.
   Harper, 71, said he had completed nine miles through the
68-degree Pacific Ocean waters when he was forced to stop Tuesday
because he became nauseated and aggravated an old shoulder injury.
   Harper, who plunged into the water at the island's Emerald Cove
at 11 p.m. on Monday, was forced to quit at 5:45 a.m.
   ``I feel fine physically,'' he said in a ship-to-shore telephone
interview about an hour after he climbed aboard his escort boat,
the Golden Greek. ``But I'm naturally disappointed.''
   He doesn't plan to try the endurance swim again this summer.
``If I do try again, it will be next summer, I think,'' said
Harper, adding, ``I'm only 71, you know.''

   Mats Wilander, the U.S. Open champion
and top-ranked tennis player in the world, says he's withdrawing
from the Olympic Games because of a leg injury.
   ``I'm not going to Seoul,'' Wilander told the Swedish news
agency TT from his home in Greenwich, Conn., on Tuesday. ``It's not
worth it. I have a problem with shin splits in my leg and I'm not
going to take a chance.''
   Wilander had indicated after his five-set victory over Ivan
Lendl in Sunday's U.S. Open final that he would skip the Olympic
Games, which begin this weekend.
   Wilander, who was troubled by periostitis five weeks ago during
the ATP Championships in Cincinnati, was advised by his doctor to
withdraw from the Olympics, TT said.
   ``My doctor told me that the injury can get worse if I don't
rest,'' Wilander was quoted as saying.
   The 24-year-old Swede, who also won the Australian and French
Opens this year, said he will rest more than one month.

   Broadcast analyst Hank Stram, who coached
the Kansas City Chiefs to three American Football League
championships and a Super Bowl victory, was listed in stable
condition after undergoing open heart surgery.
   Doctors at Methodist Hospital replaced Stram's aortic valve with
an artificial one during a four-hour operation Tuesday, a hospital
spokesman said.
   Stram, 65, was suffering from calcific aortic stenosis, a
narrowing of the aortic valve, said his surgeon, Harold Holbrook.
The aorta is the main artery of the body and carries blood from the
left chamber of the heart to all parts of the body.
   ``Doctors report that the surgery went well and described it as
routine,'' said hospital spokesman Jon White.
   Stram was hospitalized Saturday after complaining of dizziness.
He was in Indianapolis to work on the CBS Sports broadcast of
Sunday's National Football League game between the Chicago Bears
and Indianapolis Colts.

<HEAD>Pesticide Safety Bill Moving in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm lawmakers are moving to impose an
eight-year deadline for the completion of safety research on
hundreds of chemicals that are used to protect crops from damaging
pests.
   The plan, aimed at toughening federal regulation because of
growing concern about potential health hazards, won House
Agriculture Committee apprval Tuesday on a voice vote and now heads
to the House floor.
   Under the legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency would
have eight years to complete its safety reviews of hundreds of
pesticides.
   The agency, working under no deadline, has been finishing
reviews of about two dozen chemicals a year since the mid-1970s
when it took over the job from the Agriculture Department.
   The legislation also would largely end government payments to
chemical companies to buy up supplies of recalled pesticides. Such
payments have totaled $20 million so far.
   Critics say the cost of these ``indemnities'' has caused the EPA
to drag its feet in proceeding with the safety reviews. Under the
bill, chemical companies and the agency would share the cost of
storing and disposing of the pesticides, and manufacturers would
bear the costs of conducting the reviews.
   Lawmakers have been stymied since 1983 in efforts to reauthorize
the 1949 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA). They had been saying no action was likely until next year.
   Committee approval of the latest bill, however, signaled an
effort to send legislation to the president before Congress
adjourns next month. Few, however, expressed much enthusiasm for
what they called a modest effort in which the lack of far-reaching
features could prove the key to political success.
   Committee aides issued a bill summary headlined ``FIFRA Lite.''
   ``I doubt very much that there's a man on the dais who thinks
that we're doing the right thing, but we're doing what we have to
do,'' Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, told the committee.
   He said recalled pesticides currently in storage should be
burned but that lawmakers lacked the political will to push through
legislation requiring it.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas,
said the problem was that no lawmaker wanted the incinerator in his
or her home district.
   Environmentalists were concerned about the absence of any
provision calling for federal regulation of pesticides in ground
water, which represents the basic drinking supply for half of all
Americans. But they said the legislation could be worse.
   ``Like the first law of medicine, they have done no harm,'' said
Rick Hind of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an
organization founded by Ralph Nader that has waged a long pesticide
safety battle.
   The group issued a report Tuesday saying a search of EPA records
showed 73 pesticides have been found in ground water in 34 states,
a slight increase over previous reports from the agency.
   ``Putting off action on ground water is better than doing
something awful on ground water, which is what they would have
done,'' said Maureen Hinckle, lobbyist from the National Audubon
Society.
   ``Pesticide regulation in this country is a public health
scandal that affects each and every consumer,'' said Michelle
Meier, Consumers Union counsel for government affairs. ``This clean
piece of legislation shows that Congress is serious about tackling
the problem once and for all this year.''
   Farmers and exterminators use some 2.6 billion pounds of
pesticides in the United States every year. Perhaps 40,000 products
are sold, but they are basically formulations of 656 active
ingredients.
   An outgrowth of World War II chemical warfare research,
pesticides have played a major part in increasing crop yields and
placing better-looking farm products on grocers' shelves. But some
of the chemicals have been found to cause cancer and other severe
health problems in laboratory animals.

   Airline pilots must fly when passengers want to
travel: early in the morning, late at night, across continents and
oceans, regardless of the vagaries of delays and bad weather.
Despite these grueling schedules, however, dangerous fatigue is not
inevitable. This final story in a three-part AP Extra series, ``6
Miles Up and Sleepy,'' examines ways of coping with sleepiness in
the cockpit.

   One often-proposed solution to the dangers of pilot fatigue is
legalization of a remedy that is obvious and widely practiced, but
forbidden _ naps in the cockpit.
   Passengers may blanch at the idea of their captain snoozing
while they watch a movie six miles above the Earth. But sleep
researchers contend this is a sensible way to cope with the flight
crew exhaustion caused by late-night arrivals, early-morning
departures and time-zone crossings.
   While air travel is generally safe, the experts say it could be
safer still if human frailties were considered in the design of
flight rules, pilot schedules and the planes themselves.
   Some in the flying business, however, are reluctant to
acknowledge fatigue as a concern. The Federal Aviation
Administration has publically voiced skepticism that sleepy pilots
create a hazard in the skies. The airlines seem to fear that
proposed rule changes would make scheduling more difficult, and
some pilots fret that they would lose the large blocks of free time
they now enjoy.
   Industry observers, moreover, contend that one of the most
powerful impediments to change is the very image of the airline
pilot: fit, trim and male, calm, confident and capable. Surely such
a person can deal with a little thing like sleepiness.
   ``There is a widely held belief that mental toughness, good
management or physical fitness will overcome sleepiness. That is
categorically incorrect,'' said Dr. David Dinges, a sleep
researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. ``Your brain still
needs sleep, and you get yoursef into serious trouble when you try
to tough that out.''
   Several approaches are being considered: cockpits that monitor
their operators, medicines that help flight crews sleep when off
duty, schedules that figure in the time of departure and the
direction of travel as well as the length of the work day.
   But one of the easiest and simplest solutions is the nap.
   ``It's common knowledge that people are napping in the cockpit
because they are so tired,'' said R. Curtis Graeber, a sleep
scientist at the NASA-Ames Research Center in California. ``We are
looking very closely at the potential safety benefits of allowing
limited napping in the seat.''
   The U.S. Air Force encourages its crews to nap on long cargo
flights, and some foreign countries, Britain and West Germany among
them, allow sleeping in airline cockpits. Under Federal Aviation
Administration rules, however, napping is considered careless and
reckless operation of the aircraft.
   Yet on the long mid-flight stretches across continents and
oceans, pilots have little to do but monitor their dials. Nature
takes its course. In interviews with The Associated Press, pilots
reported frightening instances of awakening to find their two
colleagues sound asleep as the airliner cruises through the night
skies.
   Graeber proposes that naps be carefully scheduled so each member
of the flight crew anticipates a rest period.
   ``Napping will be very helpful, if it's ever implemented,''
agreed Mary Carskadon, a sleep researcher at Brown University. ``It
makes so much more sense to schedule it in than to all of a sudden
have all three members of the flight crew asleep because no one is
scheduled to sleep.''
   Far more difficult, the experts agree, is improving pilot
schedules. Rules set by the FAA and union agreements dictate how
many hours a day pilots can be on duty and in the air. But the
standards allow myriad permutations of day and night departures and
arrivals that often leave crews out of synchronism with their
internal circadian clocks.
   ``I think pilot scheduling is as good as it can be right now
reflecting what we know,'' said Alan McArtor, head of the FAA. ``As
we understand it better, the scheduling, I think, will reflect
that.''
   McArtor and airline officials are awaiting results of research
now being conducted jointly by NASA, the Airline Pilots Association
and United Airlines.
   Beginning this fall, Graeber and other researchers will fly with
pilots on long, over-ocean routes, monitoring their body
temperatures and brain waves as they fly through the night.
   The resulting advice may not please either pilots or airlines.
   Pilots, often vehement critics of schedules, might find their
flight time spread over a longer calendar period, eliminating the
intense two to three weeks of flying that gives them the rest of
the month off.

   Airlines, already pinched by deregulatory competition and a
pilot shortage, may have trouble staffing their cockpits and paying
additional salaries if researchers say pilots should fly reduced
schedules.
   FAA scheduling regulations have changed little since the 1930s,
when lumbering prop planes rarely crossed more than one time zone a
day. Among those who think they can be improved is John Lauber, a
sleep researcher on the National Transportation Safety Board.
   ``An arbitrary restriction on flight and duty time and mandatory
rest time that doesn't take into account circadian factors is
simply not 20th century,'' he said. ``We know that an hour of sleep
is not an hour of sleep, depending on when you take it. One of the
biggest improvements we could make in our regulations would be to
recognize those factors and adjust schedules appropriately.''
   The experts contend that schedules should consider the time of
departure, the number of time zones crossed and the direction of
travel. (The body adjusts more quickly when traveling west to east
than east to west.)
   Another part of the problem is the plane itself. The modern
cockpit is a fine place for involuntary slumber. The lights are
dim. The seats are comfortable. The air rushes past with a soothing
hum.
   Planes are so automated that they quite literally fly
themselves. Except while landing and taking off, there is often
little for crew members to do. The newest planes don't even require
a flight engineer, so standard crew size is being reduced from
three members to two. Some pilots and sleep experts complain that
this increases the odds the entire crew will doze off.
   ``The fewer people in the cockpit, the fewer safeguards you
have,'' said Dr. Martin Moore-Ede of Harvard, a sleep expert at
Harvard Medical School. ``It's easier for two people to nod off
than three.''
   But Delmar Fadden, a Boeing administrator, asserts just the
opposite is likely: ``If there are only two in the cockpit, both
know that they can't rely on a third person, so they are more
attentive to the tasks they are doing and are much less likely to
allow themselves to go to sleep.''
   Fadden, who establishes design requirements for the Boeing 747
and 767, said, ``We can't do a lot about the fact that the crew
might be fatigued. What we try to do is make the airplane tolerant
of the crew's reaction.''
   This means designing planes to be safe even when flown by bored,
drowsy, inattentive pilots. If something goes wrong, such as a
generator failure, the plane automatically compensates without
waiting for the crew to act.
   Fadden said some planes being built will monitor their crews.
Alarms will sound if pilots do nothing for 20 minutes. Such a lapse
of activity could mean the pilots are daydreaming or worse.
   Another possible solution, used by the British during the
Falkland Islands crisis, is a drug to help pilots sleep before
night flights. Bill Storm, a psychologist at Brooks Air Force Base
in San Antonio, Texas, said the U.S. military is experimenting with
the drug temazepam.
   All of these suggested changes are intended to lessen the chance
that cockpit fatigue will combine with bad weather, equipment
failure and other random hazards to trigger a disaster.
   ``We run a very safe air transportation system,'' said Lauber.
``But we are pushing people harder. We know from anecdotal data
that people are not as alert as they should be. They are falling
asleep in some circumstances. I think it's appropriate that we
re-examine the way we approach these things.''

   Imagine this work week:
   Leave Los Angeles at 8:15 p.m. and fly 5{ hours to Honolulu.
Rest the second day, but leave late that night _ at 1 a.m., which
is 4 a.m. Los Angeles time _ for the 8{-hour flight to Auckland,
New Zealand, where you wait 90 minutes then fly three more hours to
Sydney, Australia. After a day's rest in Australia, you do the same
thing in reverse, landing back in Los Angeles seven days after you
left.
   Or consider this schedule:
   Leave Boston at 6:15 a.m., fly two hours to Cincinnati, leave an
hour later on a 4{-hour flight to Los Angeles. Twelve hours after
landing, you're back in the cockpit, flying all night to Cincinnati
and, after an hour on the ground, on to Newark, arriving back on
the East Coast 26 hours after you left.
   It is schedules like these, the first flown by United Airlines
crews, the second by Delta Airlines, that pilots say wear them
down, sometimes leaving them groggy and prone to mistakes.
   ``What we're doing with these schedules is taking human beings
and saying let's get the maximum out of them,'' said one United
captain interviewed by The Associated Press, who asked not to be
identified out of concern for his job. ``As a result we've got
crews who are in rough shape out there.''
   Yet another United captain who makes trans-Pacific flights said
his most recent six-day tour of duty went like this:
   10:15 a.m. _ Arrive Los Angeles International Airport for 11:35
jumbo jet trip to Tokyo. Go through paper work, check flight plans,
weather, fuel, passenger load.
   Flight promises to be particularly heavy, requiring unscheduled
fuel stop in Alaska. Several passengers fail to show, making extra
stop unnecessary, but threatened schedule change and a mixup
getting departure clearance mean plane is pushed away from the gate
40 minutes late.
   12:35 p.m. _ After starting the engines, taxiing out to runway,
going over checklist, plane takes off.
   After liftoff, ``we run a sterile cockpit until top of climb,''
the captain says. ``That means all business, no chitchat, no PA
announcements. We check the instruments, seeing that the systems
are running as we expect, and check the inertial navigation system
to make sure it is tracking with ground navigation aids.''
   The plane leaves the California coast north of San Francisco and
passes over the Aleutian Islands. From then on, the flight is
routine. The crew makes regular position checks, watches the
navigational instruments, listens to an emergency frequency, chats
with other planes and eats. (Crew meals are better than coach but
not as fancy as first class.)
   As plane approaches Tokyo about 10 hours after takeoff, there
are more checklists and instructions from air traffic controllers.
``You have to screw up your level of concentration, because
insidiously you often are not aware of your fatigue,'' the captain
says.
   2:48 p.m. Tokyo time, following day _ Plane lands at Narita
International Airport. Pilot's cockpit time between leaving the
terminal in Los Angeles and parking in Tokyo, ``block to block'' as
they say, is 11 hours and 33 minutes.
   The crew is on duty for 30 minutes more, finishing up paper
work. They clear customs and immigration and are picked up by a bus
for the 15-minute ride to a hotel.
   The captain stays up a couple of hours more, having dinner,
reading and unwinding. He finally goes to sleep at 8 p.m., which is
5 a.m. Los Angeles time. He sleeps five or six hours, wakes up well
before dawn. He has breakfast, reads and exercises. At noon, he
tries unsuccessfully to sleep again.
   5 p.m. _ Bus picks up crew for 6:30 departure for Seattle.
   Before this tour is over, the pilot flies back to Tokyo via
Anchorage, Alaska, then returns to Los Angeles. When he gets home,
he sleeps 13 hours straight.
   Such schedules are relatively common and uniformly grueling.
   The problem, say officials, is that to schedule the 18,500 daily
flights, to get people where they want when they want, to remain
competitive and cost-effective, some pilots must fly through the
night across multiple time zones then come back eight hours later
and do it again.
   Typically, each airline presents its monthly flights to both
human schedulers and computers programmed to consider the vagaries
of economics, fuel consumption, regulations, contracts and human
and equipment limits.
   Men and machines come up with possibilities that are
double-checked.
   ``We take a look at it based on the safety issues,'' said George
Hof, head of flight operations at American Airlines. ``The
computer, in optimizing the costs in crewing the series of flights,
will take a look at the duty time available and cram a lot of
flying into that.''
   Once approved, the crew lists are put up for bid. The pilots bid
for schedules based on their desirability and hourly pay rate.
Those who fly the bigger, faster planes get paid more. Pilot wages
range from about $70,000 a year to a top of $160,000.
   According to the Airline Pilots Association, the average pilot
is in the cockpit about 80 hours a month and spends another 80
hours on duty, preparing for flights or waiting for passengers to
load and unload.
   This total of 160 hours is crammed into an average of 16 days a
month.
   Management and pilots agree there is little way to avoid some of
the overnight, multiple time zone schedules that test pilots'
endurance.
   ``You're not going to work it all out,'' said Dick Stone, a
Delta captain and chairman of the pilots union's Human Performance
Committee. ``We work silly hours and that's just the way the
business is.''

   The Burmese army _ tough, disciplined
and hitherto loyal _ has emerged as the key power broker in an
increasingly chaotic country where the authoritarian government is
besieged by a popular revolt.
   Only a few of the 186,000 soldiers have defected to join masses
of protesters demanding the military-backed government step down so
an interim administration can supervise the first multiparty
elections in 26 years.
   ``It's the only really organized force in the country. Whoever
gains its loyalty controls the state,'' Burma specialist Josef
Silverstein said.
   ``I think the army is still 100 percent behind (former
President) Ne Win and (President) Maung Maung. They're in the
ramparts and I don't see any shift in their loyalty,'' the American
expert said in an interview.
   The government and sole political party could not have withstood
the last seven weeks of massive demonstrations without solid
military backing, analysts say. The army even has been willing to
gun down unarmed protesters.
   The civil service, meanwhile, is bolting.
   The experts speculate, however, that the military might have
splintered without behind-the-scenes maneuvering by retired leader
Ne Win, architect of both the 1962 coup and the military's power
and privilege.
   Diplomats in Rangoon say military units are stockpiling food,
fuel and other vital supplies that are fast disappearing.
   The army and other agents of the state have been reported
encouraging violence, looting and rumors _ perhaps hoping to
justify a military crackdown led by Ne Win's old guard, which
includes Maung Maung.
   But Rangoon diplomats say opposition leaders Tin Oo and Aung
Gyi, both widely respected officers who earlier broke with Ne Win,
could win the military to their side.
   A third possibility is a coup by ``Young Turks'' in combat
commands who are known to have grown disillusioned with corruption,
inefficiency and the high living of the elite, while troops are
sent to battle rebels armed with rifles that jam in the tropical
rains.
   The sole certainty is that a violent confrontation between the
army and the opposition would result in great bloodshed.
   The few weapons available to students, workers and allied groups
are knives, clubs and ``jinglees'' _ homemade, poisoned projectiles.
   The army _ although one of the poorest-equipped in world _ has
been described by military attaches in Rangoon as ``tough, lean and
mean.'' The ranks of its eight light infantry divisions are filled
by some of the best foot soldiers in Asia, second only to those of
Vietnam.
   The army also has been imbued with what Israeli scholar and
Burma expert Moshe Lissak calls a sense of ``historic mission.''
   Military men, including Ne Win, gained prestige by leading the
struggle against British colonialism, and upon independence in 1948
found a power vacuum they moved to fill. The army also provided
protection for the Burman, Buddhist heartland against ethnic
insurgents pressing inward from the frontier.
   ``Faced by a plethora of enemies, communist and ethnic
separatists, and supported by a weak and uncertain civilian
government, the army leadership developed the ability to function
independently of civilian control,'' wrote British scholar Robert
Taylor in ``The State in Burma.''
   Armed with definite ideas about how to run the country, Ne Win's
clique seized power in 1962. Retired colonels were charged with
running government departments and ex-generals became ministers.
   The results were political repression and economic ruin.
   ``We know the end of the story now, but in the 1960s the
military were looked upon as saviors,'' Lissak said. They became a
privileged group, with extra pay, medical care, survivor benefits
and jobs upon retirement _ special benefits they can have no desire
to lose.

<HEAD>$1 Million Gift to Endow Football Coach's Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yale University has endowed faculty
chairs in numerous esoteric fields. Now the Ivy League school's
football coach will join that elite company as the Joel E. Smilow
Coach of Football.
   Yale announced Tuesday that Smilow, a 1954 Yale graduate and
president, chairman and chief executive officer of Stamford-based
Playtex Inc., had donated $1 million to endow the head football
coach's job, the first endowed position in the athletic department.
   ``Excellence in football is not a core objective of Yale or any
other great institution of higher education,'' said Smilow, whose
college football career was limited to intramural touch football.
   ``However, it is my belief that football is an integral part of
the very broad objective of attracting, educating and motivating
persons with the potential to become tomorrow's leaders,
irrespective of the field of endeavor which they choose to pursue.''
   Yale officials would not release the salary of Yale's football
coach, Carmen Cozza, who is entering his 24th season and has
compiled a record of 139 wins, 70 losses and 4 ties. School
officials also would not say how much of the endowment will be used
to finance the position.
   Yale President Benno C. Schmidt said Smilow's gift ``will help
carry forward the glorious tradition of varsity football at Yale.''
   But the gift provoked mild disapproval among some students.
   ``The money could go to something else,'' said junior Elizabeth
Archley. ``I can't see what else Carm Cozza could do that would
warrant such money.''
   Smilow brushed aside the criticism, saying the gift would allow
the university to use money from the coach's salary in other areas.
   As an undergraduate, Smilow broadcast Yale football games as
sports director for WYBC, the college radio station, and said
during a telephone interview that his secret ambition had been ``to
be a Brent Musburger,'' the sports announcer for CBS.
   ``I love Yale and I love football,'' he said.
   Although football is generally considered a more genteel affair
in the Ivy League than in powerhouse leagues like the Southwest,
Southeastern, Big Eight and Pacific-10 Conference, Yale boasts
among its alumni Calvin Hill, who played as a running back for the
Dallas Cowboys after graduating in 1966; and Rich Diana, a 1982
graduate who played for the Miami Dolphins.
   Yale also has more football victories than any other college in
the nation _ 743, followed by the University of Michigan's 684. And
Yale has had 118 players named All-Americans.

   George Bush has got a hankering to turn back
the clock about half a century so he can be a teen-ager again.
   That's what he told a roadside crowd of school children and
youths who gathered in this rural town to watch his campaign
motorcade go by Tuesday.
   Speaking on his limousine loudspeaker, he told them, ``I must
confess, I wish I was about a junior, maybe a senior in high
school, because I see the next decade strong, and I see the next
decade a challenge.''
   The 300 young people standing on the grounds of Tipton High
School cheered with delight at the vice president's impromptu
remarks and the sight of the long motorcade with security agents
and official looking entourage.
   Two teachers said the high school was notified by campaign
officials about 15 minutes ahead of time that the motorcade would
pass by, so the students, along with some younger children from an
elementary school, came out to see the excitement.
   Bush spoke to them for a few minutes, saying he just wanted to
see the home of the undefeated Tipton High football team.
   Bush said he likes to get out to these local communities to
``understand the heartbeat of the United States'' while ``a lot of
people are sitting back in Washington or some university'' wanting
to ``knock the system.''
   Bush concluded by pledging himself to work for a more peaceful
and prosperous world. He shook hands with the children who surged
forward, and then his motorcade continued down the country road.
   But it was only a few miles before the vice president had an
encounter with the ``you can't please everybody'' department.
   There was another quick stop, this one at a corner convenience
store called Break Time.
   It seems the vice president was getting a little hungry on the
long drive from Jefferson City, where he had a rally, to Whiteman
Air Force Base, where his plane awaited.
   So Bush, his wife, Barbara, and their Secret Service retinue
trooped into the little store to pick up a couple of slices of
pizza and some soft drinks.
   The vice president told the young woman cashier he was starving
as he pulled out his wallet and paid for the food.
   Outside, while Bush briefly shook hands with a few curious
onlookers, a local police officer was informing other members of
the entourage that all was not well at the Butterfield Inn
restaurant next door.
   It seems the proprietor had been told to expect a lunch stop by
the Bush brigade before Bush veered off to the convenience store.
   ``He's got that place all set up for the vice president,'' the
officer said. ``Tell him thanks a lot.''
   Asked later aboard Air Force Two whether he was aware of the
perceived slight, Bush showed surprise, but said: ``We weren't
looking for a big fancy restaurant. I didn't want a fancy meal.''

   Roger Hargreaves, who turned his deskpad doodlings
into the popular ``Mister Men'' and ``Little Miss'' storybooks for
children, died Monday of a heart attack at age 53.
   Combining his doodles with bed-time stories he made up for his
own children, it took Hargreaves just two weeks to find a publisher
and in 1972 his first six stories went on sale. They introduced
young readers to Mister Bump, Mister Strong and Mister Sneezy.
   In 1981, he began a series featuring such characters as Little
Miss Fussy and Little Miss Sunshine. Some 85 million are in
circulation, translated into 22 languages. The stories have more
than 750 characters and spinoffs include a television cartoon
series and childrens' cups and plates, stationery and clothing.

   Charlie Palmieri, a salsa pianist who as a band
leader helped create new forms of Latin jazz, died Monday
apparently of a heart attack. He was in his early 60s.
   Palmieri played with Latin dance orchestras and hotel bands,
including those led by Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaria. In 1959,
he introduced the band Charanga Duboney, a group that was popular
in New York.
   In 1961, Palmieri became musical director of the Allegre
All-Stars, who merged mambos with jazz solos. He also performed
with his own groups and as a guest with other jazz musicians.
Palmieri's most recent album was ``A Giant Step.''

   Lauris Norstad, a retired Air Force General
and the first airman to serve as commander of NATO forces in
Western Europe, died Monday. He was 81.
   Promoted to brigadier general in 1943, Norstad was involved in
planning fr the Allied invasion of North Africa. He personally went
ashore with the assault forces, earning a Silver Star for gallantry.
   Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, then Army chief of staff, appointed
Norstad director of plans and operations after the war. Later, when
Eisenhower was head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, he
made him his leading air commander.
   Norstad was promoted to four-star general in 1952. In 1956, he
was appointed supreme commander of Allied forces in Western Europe,
becoming the first airman to head the 15-nation NATO forces.
   Norstad was named president of Owens-Corning Fiberglas
International after he retired from the military.

<HEAD>Miss America No. 1 in American's TV Heart</HEAD>

   She might not be any match for them on the
field, but Miss America knocked out those big mean football boys in
the television ratings.
   CBS and ABC vainly put up college football games against ``The
Miss America Pageant'' on NBC, but they ended up way downfield in
60th and 62nd places, respectively, while Miss America was No. 1.
   NBC estimates that between 50 million and 55 million viewers
watched all or part of the pageant on Saturday night, giving it a
rating of 22.3 and a 44 share, higher than last year's 20.4 and 42,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   The highest-rated Miss America Pageant was in 1986. It got a
23.0 rating and a 44 share.
   Each rating point represents 886,000 homes with televisions. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   After the pageant, last week's top prime-time shows were:
``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``Baby Boom'' NBC, ``The Cosby Show'' NBC,
``Monday Night Football _ Washington vs. New York Giants'' ABC, the
Bob Hope Special on NBC, ``Full House'' on ABC in its Tuesday time
period, ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``Cheers'' NBC and ``227'' NBC.
   ``Baby Boom'' is a preview of a new show, based on the movie by
that name and starring Kate Jackson as an executive who inherits a
baby. It was slotted after ``Golden Girls'' and before Miss
America. NBC said the ``Baby Boom'' rating was the highest this
season for the network in that time period.
   For the week that ended Sunday, NBC won with an average
prime-time rating of 12.6 to ABC's 11.2 and CBS' 9.3.
   The evening news race was even tighter than usual, but it was an
unusual week because of the Jerry Lewis telethon and football. The
result was ``CBS Evening News'' and ABC's ``World News Tonight''
tying with a rating of 9.5. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.4. Each of
the three got a 20 share. CBS' news was carried by 98 percent of
its stations, 97 percent for NBC and 96 percent for ABC because of
``Monday Night Football'' on the network.
   There might have been some effect from the New York CBS
affiliate's move of the ``CBS Evening News'' to 6:30, opposite
ABC's ``World News Tonight.'' ``NBC Nightly News'' is on its own in
New York at 7 p.m. New York represents about 7 percent of the total
television audience.
   Fox Broadcasting recorded the highest rating yet for its
prime-time series when ``America's Most Wanted'' got a 9.0 and
ranked 43rd among all network shows. Two other Fox shows, ``Married
... with Children'' and ``21 Jump Street'' also landed high enough
in the ratings to out-rank several network programs.

<HEAD>Gilbert: Third Force 5 Hurricane This Century</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175
miles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most
intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
   Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center,
reported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric
pressure at Gilbert's center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on
Tuesday. Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   ``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western
Hemisphere,'' Zimmer said. The previous record low pressure of
26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck
the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he
said.
   With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and
200 miles south of the hurricane's center, Gilbert also was one of
the largest. But because the circumference of a hurricane changes
so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall
size, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.
   Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to
hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probably
about half that size, Moore said.
   Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere
since weather officials began keeping detailed records. The others
were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which
bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot
wave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
   A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster
in U.S. history, however. That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8
and killed more than 6,000 people.
   Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric
pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18
feet.
   The storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye of
the hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path
_ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.
   Camille's storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center
was forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.
   The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _
shrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs and
windows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.
   ``Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,'' Zimmer
said. ``The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist air
in the center. If the atmospheric conditions in general allow this
warm chimney to build to very high levels, 10-12 miles high, then
you can have a severe hurricane.''
   Category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to
155 mph, surge of 13-18 feet and pressure of 27.17 to 27.90. The
weakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of
74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.

drug tests required of student athletes.
   _The Dallas Morning News, for a six-month investigation and
two-part series exposing how the judiciary in Texas excluded itself
from federal and state open records and meetings laws, allowing
judges to operate outside public scrutiny.
   _The Review Times, of Fostoria, Ohio, for its efforts to gain
access to non-patient records of a community hospital association,
involving lengthy court battles and ultimately legislative action
to revamp and restore Ohio's public records law.
   _The Miami News, for accomplishments including preserving the
right of the news media to conduct voter exit polls, winning
release of documents sealed in a local murder case, the application
of FOI in exposing flaws in a bail-bond system, and the use of FOI
to document the wealth of the Archdiocese of Miami.
   _The San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News for its investigative series
exposing a behind-the-scenes relationship between the Fair
Political Practices Commission in California and the politicians it
was supposed to monitor.

<TEXT>
   This summer's drought stunted corn,
wheat and soybean yields in the Midwest, but some farmers in
pockets that received rain could reap bumper crops and harvest them
two weeks early.
   ``We've got good, great big ears. I'd say it looks awful good. I
figure the yield will be as good as last year, maybe 150 bushels''
an acre, says Kossuth County farmer William Green.
   ``It looks like we'll average a strong 150 bushels per acre out
here,'' echoed Art Benken, manager of the Farmer's Cooperative
Elevator in Wesley, in north-central Iowa. That's about double the
estimated statewide average last year.
   State by state estimates of corn and bean yields in Monday's
September crop report from the U.S. Agriculture Department said
drought damage has not worsened since the August report.
   The corn harvest is estimated at 4.46 billion bushels, a
five-year low. More than one-sixth of the crop is in Iowa, where
the government predicted a harvest of 811.2 million bushels, the
smallest in 24 years.
   Benken said that while most of the Midwest was baking under the
drought, Wesley was getting timely rain, including a drenching in
the wake of a July 8 tornado that hit about 140 miles southwest.
   ``The tornado that hit Council Bluffs slowed down when it got
out here and gave us 3.5 inches of rain over two and a half days,''
he said.
   While the corn and bean harvest will be reduced nationwide,
other crops showed an increase, according to the report. August
rains helped boost the estimated tobacco yield in Kentucky while
the cotton crop in Texas will be the fourth-highest ever.
   ``We'll probably have a good crop at low prices,'' said Carl
Anderson, an extension economist in College Station, Texas,
specializing in cotton.
   The drought was particularly hard on South Dakota wheat farmers,
where the government is estimating a yield of 15.6 million bushels,
the lowest production since 1959 and down 68 percent from last year.
   ``Most producers I've talked to say they can hold on for another
year,'' said Brenda Mangin Forman, executive director of the South
Dakota Wheat Producers, Inc. ``But it's going to be tough. A lot of
it depends on the drought aid from the government and how they
decide to work advance deficiency payments next spring.''
   The national soybean harvest was estimated at a 12-year low of
1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from last year but virtually
unchanged from the August forecast. However, one expert thought the
government's numbers were suspect.
   ``Generally, USDA reports will lag on the high side when you
have a drought,'' said extension marketing specialist Lynn Lutgen,
of Omaha, Neb. He said he is more comfortable with private
estimates of lower yields.
   While the drought has shriveled yields, it has also caused the
corn crop to mature much faster than usual. Corn normally isn't dry
enough for market until about Oct. 1.
   At the elevator in Wesley, Benken said farmers are bringing in
heavy loads of quality grain.
   Kossuth County Extension Director John Lee said the Wesley area
had 17 inches of rainfall over the summer in addition to 8 inches
of hold-over moisture at planting time.
   ``Heck, with 25, 27 inches of rain, you can raise corn,'' he
said.
   Other farms in the same county didn't share the wealth of
wetness.
   ``I've heard estimates ranging all the way from 50 bushels up to
175,'' said county soil specialist Bill Gast in Algona.
   Extension economist Bob Wisner at Iowa State University in Ames
said several factors could lower corn yields below government
estimates, including weak stalks. Fragile stalks can topple in wind
or rain, making it difficult for mechanical reapers to harvest, he
said.
   The drought has left its mark in other businesses as well.
   Executives of barge companies that ply the nation's rivers said
they had expected to make money in 1988 after struggling for most
of the decade because of depressed hauling rates. But drought
restrictions have closed some rivers, at least temporarily, and
slowed passage through others, as well as limited the number of
barges pushed by one tow and the loads they carry.
   ``Finally this year, people began to make money until Mother
Nature gave us a lousy deal,'' said Jeffrey Smith, vice president
of the American Waterways Operators, a trade group.
   A study commissioned by the group projected that industry this
year will suffer losses of as much as $200 million on revenues of
$1 billion, Smith said.

   Barry Sadler, who recorded the ``Ballad
of the Green Berets,'' was training Nicaraguan rebels in Guatemala
and had received death threats before he was shot in the head, a
friend said.
   Sadler, 46, was unconscious and listed in critical but stable
condition Tuesday after seven hours of surgery at Veterans
Administration Medical Center, where he was admitted Monday night
after being flown from Guatemala City.
   Physicians were reserving judgment on the possibility of
recovery, hospital spokeswoman Patty Zwald said.
   ``Basically, the doctors have said time will tell,'' she said.
   Duke Faglier, who had lived off-and-on with Sadler in Guatemala
for two years, said Sadler had received death threats in the
Central American country in recent months.
   ``People had written `die gringo' on the walls around the
house,'' he said. ``Gunshots had been fired into the house and
there were (threatening) phone calls.''
   The men, who served in the Army together, had trained Guatemalan
soldiers and Contras in firearms use and their work was common
knowledge there. The U.S.-backed Contras are fighting to overthrow
the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   ``I'm sure it made us less than popular,'' he said.
   Faglier and Sadler's literary agent, Bob Robison, said Sadler
was wounded once with a handgun Wednesday night or Thursday
morning, apparently as he got into a cab during a robbery attempt
in Guatemala City.
   ``He resisted,'' Robison said. ``There have been lots of
rumors.''
   Sadler, as Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler, co-wrote and recorded
``Ballad of the Green Berets'' which was the No. 1 song in the
country for five weeks in 1966. The song, a tribute to the Special
Forces, sold 9 million singles and albums. Billboard Magazine, a
weekly trade publication of the music business, named it the No. 1
single of the year.
   Sadler had written the song while recuperating from a leg wound
suffered in a booby trap in Vietnam, where he served periodically
from 1965 to 1967.
   He later made his living writing adventure novels, many of them
set in Central America. Robison said Sadler's 30 novels have sold
in the millions with the most recent being ``Razor,'' ``Seppuku''
and ``Soldier of Gideon.''

   A candidate for the District of Columbia
Council was stabbed after allegedly attacking an employee of his
opponent and has been charged with simple assault, while his
assailant faces charges of assault with a deadly weapon, police
said.
   Jacques Chevalier, 33, a Ward 2 candidate in the district's
Democratic Party primary, was listed in fair condition today at
George Washington University Hospital with a stab wound to the
chest, said hospital spokeswoman Karen Johnson.
   Chevalier, who was challenging incumbent John Wilson for the
nomination, allegedly began kicking and punching 41-year-old Louise
Young outside a polling site on Tuesday afternoon, said D.C. police
spokesman Walt Ferguson.
   Harold Sims, 56, then interceded on Young's behalf, and
allegedly stabbed Chevalier, authorities said.
   Ms. Young, an aide in Wilson's office, refused medical
treatment. Police had not determined why Chevalier allegedly
attacked her.
   ``I'd love to know what those two were talking about,'' Ferguson
said.
   Chevalier, a local real estate agent and District native, was
making his first bid for public office, and got just 5 percent of
the vote.
   Wilson, chairman of the council's Finance Committee, received 94
percent of the vote. He is seeking a fourth term on the council.

<HEAD>Judge Orders U.S. Information Agency to Rewrite `Propaganda' Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal rules that allow officials to brand a
documentary movie as propaganda before it is exported must be
rewritten because they are unconstitutional, a federal judge has
ruled.
   The ruling is an interim step in a protracted freedom-of-speech
dispute between the U.S. Information Agency and a group of largely
liberal moviemakers who accuse the Reagan administration of
hampering foreign distribution of their films.
   The moviemakers' attorney, David Cole, on Tuesday hailed the
decision as a rejection of a threat by USIA Director Charles Z.
Wick to pull out of an international cultural exchange treaty if
the courts rule against the agency.
   ``(Wick) played his bluff and the court didn't take it,'' Cole
said in a telephone interview from the New York offices of the
Center for Constitutional Rights, the public-interest lawyers'
group pressing the filmmakers' case.
   But the USIA, in a statement, said it remains committed to the
ideals of the cultural exchange treaty, called the Beirut
Agreement, which eases export of movies deemed to have educational,
scientific or cultural value.
   ``We are ... very concerned about adverse court rulings which
are interfering with our carrying out our treaty obligations
faithfully,'' the agency said.
   The written ruling issued by U.S. District Judge A. Wallace
Tashima on Sept. 9 gives the USIA 60 days to rewrite its rules for
certifying documentary movies as educational, cultural or
scientific. Though the designation isn't needed to export a film,
it eases distribution by allowing duty-free sale of movies in 70
countries that have signed the Beirut Agreement or honor it.
   Acting on an earlier order from Tashima, the agency rewrote its
rules, including in the new regulations a provision allowing a film
to be certified for duty-free export but tagged ``propaganda.''
   Tashima rejected those rules in May and ordered a second
rewrite. The latest ruling is on a request to stay that order
pending an appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The dispute began in 1985, when makers of seven documentary
films on subjects ranging from Nicaragua to nuclear war sued the
USIA, accusing it of discriminating against movies with liberal
themes in issuing certificates under the agreement.
   Agency officials have denied that politics play a role in
certifying movies under the agreement.

   The decision by longtime U.N. critic
President Reagan to pay $700 million in back dues to the United
Nations will save the world body from bankruptcy next month and
keep alive its new peacekeeping force in the Persian Gulf.
   Reagan's decision came two weeks before he is to address the
159-nation General Assembly in his final U.N. appearance.
   While the United States has been withholding dues and
criticizing the United Nations, its Soviet rival has rediscovered
the value of the organization and started paying its bills. Moscow
now promotes the United Nations and points a finger at the United
States.
   Reagan on Tuesday authorized the release of $188 million _ $44
million at once and $144 million as soon as funds become available.
It appeared to be a last gesture to the world organization, which
his administration had steadily denounced as biased and bloated.
   The president also directed the State Department to work out a
plan over several years for repaying $520 million in legally
required payments to the organization.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar welcomed Reagan's
decision and said ``he will feel more comfortable'' in making his
final address. But he added: ``President Reagan is always welcome.''
   Perez de Cuellar emphasized that financial uncertainty will
continue until more than 70 member states pay their back dues and
build up U.N. reserves.
   The U.N. chief in the past has gently criticized some in the
United States, the biggest U.N. donor, for being wary of
multilateral diplomacy and considering it an infringement on the
U.S. right to act unilaterally in the world arena.
   Foreign diplomats said recent U.N. successes in peacemaking and
peacekeeping in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq war and southern Africa
appeared to be major factors in persuading the United States to
release the legal payments it had deliberately withheld.
   The United States especially welcomed U.N. mediation of an
accord under which more than 100,000 Soviet troops were to withdraw
from Afghanistan.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced the U.S.
decision Tuesday, saying the government recognizes the increasing
U.N. peacekeeping role in Afghanistan, Namibia (South-West Africa)
and the gulf.
   ``Although the (U.N.) reform is incomplete,'' he said, ``the
progress is striking.'' He said the United States has been
demanding more accountability from the United Nations for its
spending.
   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
   ``The United States had to put its money where its mouth is ...
It is difficult for the United States to continue criticizing the
organization and withholding funds for vital operations that the
United States welcomes.
   U.N. officials have said the United Nations would be unable to
finance the new U.N. peacekeeping force in the gulf and pay U.N.
staff salaries in October without a substantial payment.
   The United States is assessed more than $200 million every year
by the United Nations _ about a quarter of the regular budget of
$800 million.
   The U.S. government and Congress had been withholding funds for
years to pressure the United Nations into political, administrative
and budgetary reforms. The administration now says it is satisfied
that reforms, although imperfect, are significant and are well
under way.
   That will tide the organization over its worst financial crisis
in years, but financial uncertainty will remain until other debtor
nations pay their arrears.
   U.N. budget arrears as of July 31 were $602 million.
Peacekeeping arrears totaled an additional $484 million.
   The top 10 debtor nations at that time were the United States,
South Africa, Brazil, Iran, the Soviet Union, Argentina, Mexico,
Israel, Poland and Romania.
   But the Soviet Union recently paid virtually all of its arrears,
after years of overdue accounts. Moscow has been seeking to promote
the United Nations as an instrument of a new kind of political
thinking and has cited the United States for withholding dues and
opposing multilateralism.

   City officials have come up with a way to
lure yuppies out of their Porsches and into buses: a luxury shuttle
that offers cushy seats, videos, wine and bagels.
   The 10-mile service from downtown to Century City is scheduled
to begin next month.
   City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who dreamed up the deluxe bus,
hopes it will ease freeway jams by attracting lawyers and other
professionals wh would rather use the time spent traveling downtown
to catch up on business than on shifting gears.
   ``What lawyers sell is their time,'' said Susan G. Schaefer,
Century City Bar Association president. ``So if half an hour or an
hour of time can be spent working rather than dodging cars, than
that's time well spent.''
   For $7.50 each way, the 18-passenger shuttles will provide
cellular phones, televisions, video casette recorders and facsimile
machines, said Ralph W. Smith Jr., president of APT Transportation,
which won the contract for the route.
   Attendants will serve coffee and bagels in the morning and soft
drinks and wine in the afternoon.
   But you can't please everyone. One lawyer detected a potential
drawback.
   ``It definitely would be nice and less tense,'' said attorney
Joel M. Grossman. ``But my guess is that most lawyers, like me,
would be concerned about the down time waiting for the next bus.''

   A businessman and a scientist want
to put a three-armed robot in chains.
   The robot unveiled Tuesday at a University of Rhode Island
laboratory was billed as the perfect worker for the jewelry
industry. It is so dexterous it can handle delicate gold chain,
solder on parts and delicately twist the clasps on and off.
   ``A person right now who gets tired after an eight-hour shift
can do an average of one (chain) a minute,'' said Philip Datseris,
an associate professor of mechanical engineering.
   The robot can do two or three a minute, stacking them neatly on
a post as it finishes them, said Datseris, who helped develop the
machine.
   The robot will help U.S. jewelry manufacturers compete with
imports, said Albert F. Wiesner III, president of Wiesner
Manufacturing Co. of Providence, the chain maker that funded the
development work.
   ``I had this envisioned in my mind for a couple of years,'' said
Wiesner, who earned a degree in mechanical engineering at Rhode
Island. ``I had the mechanics down pretty well, but I needed help
with the electronics.''
   The university designed much of the electronics, two of the
robot's arms, and the computer program that runs the robot. The
robot's main arm came from Switzerland.
   It has cost about $100,000 so far to develop the machine,
Datseris said. At least six months more is needed before the robot
is ready for patent, said Wiesner.

<HEAD>Blackmun: Future Of Court May Be Foretold This Term</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun
says the ideological bent of his newest colleague, Anthony Kennedy,
is critical to the court's direction and might threaten his Roe vs.
Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   Another good indicator of what the future holds, the 79-year-old
jurist suggested Tuesday, will be the civil rights case of
Patterson vs. McLean Credit Union, set for oral argument after the
court begins its term Oct. 3
   ``I think the outcome of that case will be of some significance
as to the movement of the court during the balance of the 20th
century,'' Blackmun told law students at the University of Arkansas
at Little Rock.
   The court stunned civil rights groups in April when it announced
it wanted to use the Patterson case to re-examine a 12-year-old
precedent that held a private, all-white school violated the law in
refusing to consider black applicants based on their race.
   The 1976 case allowed damages to be awarded against private
parties who discriminate on the basis of race in deciding with whom
to contract.
   Blackmun said an aspect of the case that has bothered him was
the court's decision to re-examine the 1976 precedent on the
court's own motion _ that is, after neither of the parties brought
up the issue.
   Blackmun said he sees the court as currently divided into three
groups:
   _The liberals, Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan
Jr.
   _The conservatives, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor, and apparently
Kennedy.
   _The moderates, himself and Justices Byron R. White and John
Paul Stephens III.
   The division, Blackmun said, means that all three moderates must
align themselves with the two liberals on any given issue to take
control of the court. That the conservatives will control the court
in some areas, he said, is almost a foregone conclusion since some
of the moderates are conservative in areas. He said White, for
example, almost always lines up with the conservatives in criminal
cases, giving the conservatives their five-member majority.
   Blackmun noted it is difficult to classify Kennedy yet, because
he participated in only a few of the court's weekly conferences.
There will be a much clearer picture of the alignment next summer,
after the term concludes, he said.
   Blackmun, perhaps best known for his 1973 decision in the case
of Roe vs. Wade, which overturned restrictive anti-abortion laws in
Texas, also warned that the court could reverse that decision
during the coming term.
   He indicated the ruling could turn on how faithful Kennedy is to
the judicial doctrine of ``stare decisis,'' a policy of courts not
to disturb a settled point of law.
   ``The next question is, `Will Roe vs. Wade go down the drain?'
'' Blackmun said. ``I think there's a very distinct possibility
that it will _ this term. You can count the votes.''
   Commenting on Blackmun's remarks, Douglas Johnson, legislative
director of the National Right to Life Committee, accused the
justice of interjecting himself in the presidential campaign.
   ``Apparently Blackmun recognizes that Roe v. Wade cannot survive
merely on its constitutional merits, so he is calling for cavalry
support,'' Johnson said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Dukakis Campaigning Against Bush Liability, Not
Veep</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis relishes running against Dan
Quayle.
   ``Is there anybody here today,'' he recently asked a
shirt-sleeve rally in Portland, Ore., ``is there any citizn in the
United States of America, who thinks Dan Quayle is qualified to be
the nation's drug czar?''
   Loud cheers and hoots from the partisan crowd.
   A week later, Dukakis was in Chicago to deliver an address on
his view of U.S.-Soviet relations, the kind of speech aides were
quick to describe as ``major.''
   Early on, he questioned Republican nominee George Bush's
judgment with this example:
   ``If he truly believes that J. Danforth Quayle is qualified to
be one heartbeat away from the presidency, how can we trust his
judgment when America's future is on the line.''
   Dukakis campaign aides make no secret they are convinced Quayle,
the junior senator from Indiana, is a major liability to Bush as
the GOP vice presidential nominee.
   Certainly, polls show that most voters think Dukakis' running
mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, is far more qualified to succeed to
the presidency than Quayle.
   But those same polls also show Bush gaining, not losing, ground
since he picked Quayle.
   That phenomenon can be explained by a number of factors
unrelated to Quayle.
   The big early Dukakis lead was illusory, based as it was on
polls taken before voters were giving a moment's thought to the two
candidates.
   More important was how Dukakis dealt with his perceived setback
in his campaign to capture the White House.
   His first reaction was to heat up his rhetoric. But the target
was more often Quayle than Bush.
   But as tempting a target as Quayle might be, when Dukakis
attacks him, the Democratic presidential nominee is in the position
of spending a lot of time running against the GOP vice presidential
candidate.
   It's the political equivalent of kicking a small dog. The dog
gets all the sympathy even when he sinks his teeth into the
kicker's ankle.
   When Bentsen kicks Quayle, that's a fair fight. Or when other
Democratic senators take jabs at their GOP colleague that too is
effective.
   Dukakis has as great a dilemma and fewer options on the other
principal target of his stump speeches _ Ronald Reagan.
   Twice now _ in 1980 and 1984 _ the Democrats took their best
shots at Reagan. The total score was Reagan 93 states, Jimmy Carter
and Walter Mondale 7.
   When the 1988 campaign started, the big question was how Bush,
Reagan's impeccably loyal vice president, could separate himself
from the president. How could the vice president establish his own
identity while refusing to express the slightest disagreement with
Reagan policies?
   The question was asked and asked again. Who was George Bush?
What did he stand for?
   Bush agreed it was a problem, but said he thought he'd overcome
it.
   With a carefully staged convention and Reagan's full
cooperation, Bush did just that. He emerged from New Orleans with a
new public image. As his strategists had hoped, Bush suddenly was
perceived as the Republican presidential nominee, no longer as
Reagan's vice president.
   The Reagan problem may now have shifted.
   It's possible that Dukakis is now the candidate having trouble
separating himself from Reagan.
   When the Democratic nominee wants to attack the record of the
past seven and a half years, he is doing what Democrats had hoped
they would never again have to endure _ he is campaigning against
Ronald Reagan.
   There is no easy way out of that dilemma.
   To win, Dukakis must convince voters that it's time for a
substantive change whether they agreed or not with the policies of
the Reagan years.
   That's not an easy case to make when most economic statistics
are favorable and the outgoing president remains very popular.
   Twenty-eight years ago, John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M.
Nixon. But the country had just been through a recession and the
U-2 incident had led to a sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Dukakis may pull it off. But Reagan and Quayle are not his best
targets.

<TEXT>
   A pocketful of coupons paid off for
81-year-old Paul Trentel, who says the wad helped slow a bullet and
saved his life from an accidental shooting.
   ``Thank God I had them in there,'' Trentel said. ``The bullet
actually tore a hole through some of them. They were so thick they
must have made the bullet lose speed, because the bullet hit, then
went sideways across my chest.''
   Trentel was shot Friday when a 36-year-old woman dropped her
purse, causing the weapon to discharge, said police Detective
Robert Pestak. The woman told police she carried the gun after
being threatened by her estranged husband.
   The woman ran from the restaurant after discarding the gun in
the trash, but later surrendered to police.
   ``I heard a loud explosion that sounded like a cannon going
off,'' Trentel said. ``But I didn't know I was hit until I reached
under my jacket and found blood. I didn't feel anything. The
security guard came up to me and said `You've been shot.'''
   Trentel, of East Cleveland, said the bullet burrowed across his
chest, creating a 5-inch welt. The bullet was removed at Meridia
Euclid Hospital, and Trentel was released after the treatment.
   ``It happened so suddenly it was freaky,'' Trentel said. ``I
didn't feel any burning. They pulled the bullet out with tweezers.
I just have a small hole where they took the bullet out.''

<TEXT>
   THE GEOGRAPHY _ The three islands _ Grand Cayman, the largest,
Little Cayman and Cayman Brac _ cover 100 square miles. They are
located in the Caribbean Sea about 200 miles northwest of Jamaica.
   The islands' flat terrain is surrounded by clear waters and has
a tropical climate, with a hurricane season between July and
November.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The population of nearly 23,000 is mostly
Protestant and Roman Catholic and is of mixed European and black
African descent. English is the country's official language.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ The islands' big money-earners are financial
services and tourism. The economy also benefits from shipbuilding,
turtle and shark fishing, coconut farming, and textile and
automobile production. The 1987 per capita income was $9,000. In
1988, the islands could accomodate more than 5,000 tourists at a
time, and at least 480,792 people visited the island in 1987.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Cayman Islands were discovered by Christopher
Columbus in 1503 and came under British control in 1670. They
became a colony in 1959 and were administered by Jamaica until a
governor was appointed in 1972. The legislature includes the
governor, three officials and 12 elected members.

   Thousands of residents returned
home Tuesday as state fire officials, helped by nearly 24 hours of
favorable weather, lifted evacuation notices and reopened major
highways where a raging timber fire destroyed almost 100 homes.
   ``As far as I know, we have allowed everyone who wants to return
home to do so,'' state Department of Forestry spokesman Steve
Iverson said.
   At least 97 homes and 60 other buildings were destroyed, and
4,000 to 5,000 other structures had been threatened by the
fast-moving, wind-fanned blaze northeast of Sacramento in the
foothills of the Sierra Nevada.
   In less than 72 hours it blackened more than 52 square miles of
brush and timber north and west of Grass Valley and Nevada City in
a half-moon arc 12 miles long and two to five miles wide.
   The fire had been whipped by gusts of 30 mph and above since
Sunday, but on Tuesday, winds were moderate, temperatures were
about 10 degrees lower and the humidity level nearly double,
Iverson said.
   ``If it holds through the night, we'll consider releasing some
people tomorrow,'' said Iverson, planning chief for the
2,788-member firefighting force. ``We're looking forward to another
inversion layer Wednesday. The temperatures should be moderate.''
   An estimated 8,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in
several communities.
   Iverson said no additional homes were threatened as of Tuesday
evening. But homes inside the fire lines could be threatened if
winds shift or pick up significantly, he added.
   By nightfall Tuesday, firefighters had bulldozed lines around
more than 35 percent of the 90-mile perimeter of the blaze. The
area where it spread thickest on Tuesday _ grasslands in the
deserted eastern sector of Beale Air Force Base _ also burned out
the quickest.
   The fire was stopped more than four miles from the edge of the
main part of the base, home for some of the nation's most
sophisticated spy planes, firefighters said.
   ``It's all out. It's history. There are no problems there,''
said Bill Holmes, a Department of Forestry operations chief.
   Federal fire officials have called this the worst forest fire
season in the West in 30 years, especially considering the fires in
and around Yellowstone National Park. The fires have charred
939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park since June.
   Firefighters there on Tuesday took advantage of a cold spell to
make some headway against the blazes before potentially menacing
warmer weather sets in.
   At one point Tuesday in California, a wall of flames up to 50
feet high surrounded three sides of the forested Grass Valley Group
industrial complex, where sophisticated television graphics are
produced for networks and major stations worldwide.
   About 100 people living nearby were temporarily evacuated but
were allowed to return to their homes before nightfall. The complex
was unharmed.
   That complex, which employs 1,000 people, has been cited as one
of the leading examples of communications and other high technology
industries which have located in rural areas.
   Iverson said California's drought conditions, which accentuated
the volume of highly combustible forest materials, plus unusually
high wind and low humidity, had combined to create an especially
dangerous and unpredictable condition.
   Only seven firefighters were treated at hospitals for minor
burns. No residents were reported injured.
   The blaze, dubbed the ``49er Fire'' because it began along
winding Highway 49, apparently was started by a transient igniting
toilet paper.
   Firefighters also battled several other fires in northern
California, including a 9,000-acre blaze near Healdsburg, about 65
miles north of San Francisco, which destroyed three homes, several
outbuildings and briefly threatened a Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
geothermal generating plant. It was 75 percent contained.

   George Bush mocked Michael Dukakis as the
governor of ``Taxachusetts' on Tuesday and told business executives
his Democratic rival would pay for federal programs by reaching
``right for the wallet'' and taking their money.
   In a separate appearance in Missouri farm country, Bush also
suggested that Dukakis might oppose selling U.S.-subsidized wheat
to the Soviet Union.
   ``We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those
Democrats, Carter and Mondale and who knows who else,'' the
Republican presidential nominee declared. Dukakis' campaign has
said that improved trade with the Soviets should be linked with
progress on human rights.
   Bush delivered a breakfast address on economics to the
Executives Club in Chicago and then flew to Jefferson City, Mo.,
for a rally on the state Capitol steps.
   On a hot sunny day, a noontime crowd of thousands of people gave
Bush an enthusiastic welcome. Dukakis also had his supporters _ his
name was spelled out in large red letters across seven windows on
the Capitol's top floor.
   Later, Bush flew to Los Angeles where he attended a $1,000 a
person fund-raiser whose audience included Hollywood celebrities
Bob Hope, Dina Merrill and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   ``On the issue of peace, my opponent's views are simply beyond
the pale,'' Bush said. ``He does not, I believe, see America as the
leader of the West and it has not, I believe, occurred to him that
if America doesn't lead the free countries of the world, the free
countries of the world will not have a leader.''
   Taken together, Illinois, Missouri and California command 82 of
the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.
   In Chicago, Bush told the businessmen, ``The surest way to kill
the recovery is to raise taxes. That will stifle everything from
investment and personal savings to consumer spending. It will clamp
down on growth.
   ``It will invite a recession,'' he said.
   Bush promised anew that he would not raise taxes, that he would
fight trade protectionism and that he would attack the budget
deficit with a ``flexible freeze'' on government spending.
   He did not spell out which programs would be cut and which would
get more money, except to say that Social Security and interest
payments would be exempt from the freeze.
   Bush attacked Dukakis' plan for a federally funded, regional
job-creation and economic development program, which the
Massachusetts governor calls a fund to rebuild America.
   ``All you need to do is to make a small down payment, $500
million, to get those industrial planning technocrats to work in
Washington,'' Bush said. ``My opponent calls this kind of
government `the helping hand.'
   ``Well, where is the helping hand reaching? Right for the
wallet,'' Bush said, slapping his hand on his back pocket.
   ``What will pay for that helping hand? Your money. And who is
being helped? Not you. It's government in Washington picking the
winners and losers.''
   He asked, ``What kind of lasting jobs are going to be produced
by this partnership? Only the kind that endure on the public
payroll.''
   Bush referred to Dukakis' state as ``Taxachusetts,'' prompting
mild laughter in the audience.
   He reiterated his proposal to cut the capital gains tax to 15
percent from the current level of 28 percent. ``I'm being attacked,
saying this is a tax cut favoring the rich,'' Bush said.
   ``Not so. I believe we should cut the capital gains tax again,
not to help the rich as my opponent speciously claims, but to
create more jobs for everybody in this country,'' Bush said.
   The audience applauded loudly.
   Crediting the Reagan-Bush administration with cutting inflation
and interest rates and producing nearly 18 million new jobs, the
vice president said, ``Americans can feel and touch and bank upon
the prosperity brought by the longest running peacetime economic
expansion in our history.''
   Bush also emphasized economic issues in Jefferson City, saying
the average American family is paying $2,200 less in federal income
taxes ``than it would have under the Carter-Mondale-Dukakis rate.
We are going to keep those tax rates down.''
   The vice president listed differences with Dukakis on abortion,
gun control, school prayer and other issues.
   ``I don't believe that we want to turn far to the left in this
country,'' Bush said. ``Let's keep it going the way we've been
going, in the right direction, without going back and turning
things around.''

   Republican George Bush is raising the specter
of a Democratic-imposed grain embargo as he seeks to emphasize an
economic policy chasm between himself and presidential opponent
Michael Dukakis.
   In a pair of campaign stops Tuesday in Missouri, Bush told
supporters he wants to expand American markets abroad, saying,
``American farmers and ranchers can compete with anyone anywhere in
the world if the rules are fair.''
   The Democrats, he contended, are interested only in production
controls and want to ``control the lives of the farmers.''
   Harking back to the grain embargo imposed by President Jimmy
Carter on U.S. exports to the Soviet Union, Bush said, ``I will not
use food as a foreign policy weapon.''
   He cited a July 27 article in the Journal of Commerce that said
a Dukakis aide suggested the Massachusetts governor might
re-examine the U.S. policy of selling government subsidized wheat
to the Soviets.
   ``Can you imagine another president who would leave open the
door of using agriculture products to make political points and
using our producers in that way,'' he said. ``I will not go back to
this grain embargo. Listen, farmers are still trying to recover
from that.''
   Today Bush was courting the ethnic vote in California _ with
Hispanic events in Los Angeles and Fresno and a tour of San
Francisco's Chinatown _ following his day of barnstorming in
Illinois and Missouri.
   In Los Angeles on Tuesday night, Bush was feted at a gala
fund-raiser for the Republican Party's ``Victory '88'' fund, hosted
by California Gov. George Deukmejian.
   ``On the issue of peace, my opponent's views are simply beyond
the pale,'' Bush told the audience. ``He does not, I believe, see
America as the leader of the West and it has not, I believe,
occurred to him that if America doesn't lead the free countries of
the world, the free countries of the world will not have a leader.''
   The $1,000 a person event drew a host of Hollywood celebrities,
including Bob Hope, Dina Merrill and Arnold Schwarzeneggar.
   Bush has been clearly annoyed at allegations that forced the
resignation of seven members of an ethnic coalition and of his
choice to run the campaign activities of the Republican Party. Bush
said Tuesday he neither asked the eight to stay nor encouraged
their departure.
   In a brief conversation with reporters aboard Air Force Two,
Bush refused to say whether he would offer a spot to one of them,
Frederic Malek, in a Bush administration.
   ``I have a lot of confidence in Fred Malek, I don't think he has
one bigoted bone in his body,'' was all he would say when asked
about Malek's future should Bush win the election.
   Bush had named Malek to a top position at the Republican
National Committee, but Malek stepped down when it was revealed
that he had carried out orders from then-President Richard Nixon to
compile a list of Jews among the top officials of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
   As to the reports of alleged anti-Semitic and fascist ties by
members of his American Nationalities Coalition, he said:
   ``I don't like the allegations about people and I don't like it
being injected into the campaign.''
   Asked why he did not urge them to stay in light of that
viewpoint, he told the reporters: ``Because then you'd be talking
about this all the time, all the time for the next two months,
obscuring these other questions we're talking about _ defense,
economic policy _ that's why.''
   Bush made the comments before his plane lifted off for Los
Angeles from the Missouri trip.
   At a colorful rally at the Jefferson City state capitol, Bush
promised to give farmers expanded foreign markets.
   ``Agricultural America can compete any place in the world so
long as we give them access to other people's markets,'' he said.
   He painted a rosy economic picture under the Reagan years,
promised to ``strengthen and broaden our economic growth,'' and
said ``the family right in the middle is earning $4,000 more a year
than he would have under those tired Democratic policies.''
   Bush on Tuesday also announced a team of agricultural campaign
advisers, including Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, and former
American Farm Bureau President Robert Delano.

   Republican state Sen. Susan Engeleiter beat
former party chairman Stephen B. King in a GOP primary Tuesday for
a chance to succeed retiring Sen. William Proxmire, and Milwaukee
Bucks owner Herbert Kohl won his first bid for public office,
defeating former Gov. Anthony S. Earl in a four-way Democratic
Senate primary.
   ``I am very honored to be chosen as the Republican nominee for
the United States Senate,'' Engeleiter said after becoming the only
woman nominated to the U.S. Senate by a major party in 1988.
   ``I believe there are major differences between me and Herb
Kohl,'' she said. ``I am an average member of an average Wisconsin
family. I understand the concerns of the people out there.''
   Kohl, the millionaire owner of the National Basketball
Association franchise, easily defeated Earl, who lost a bid for
re-election in 1986, as well as former Deputy Attorney General
Edward R. Garvey and Secretary of State Douglas La Follette.
   Kohl said voters wanted ``a qualified non-politician with real
business-world experience and they said they want a senator who'll
be independent of special interests.''
   Earl, who criticized Kohl's extensive use of television ads
during the campaign, said, ``I don't think Herb Kohl would mind if
I say he got the most votes but I got the best votes.''
   With 3,195 of 3,450 precincts, or 93 percent, reporting, Kohl
had 244,085 votes, or 47 percent; Earl had 199,112 or 38 percent;
Garvey had 54,475, or 10 percent; La Follette had 20,221, or 4
percent; and tire dealer Edmond Hou-Seye had 5,139, or 1 percent.
   In Republican voting, with 3,195 of 3,450 precincts, or 93
percent reporting, Engeleiter had 192,485 votes, or 57 percent;
King had 136,110, or 40 percent; and Peter Taylor, who withdrew
from the race, had 8,638, or 3 percent.
   ``It was a family spat,'' King said in calling upon supporters
to back Engeleiter in November. ``We're only going to elect one
U.S. senator from Wisconsin this fall and that senator has to be
Susan Engeleiter,'' he said.
   Democratic Rep. Jim Moody won the nomination for a fourth term
from the 5th District. Moody announced earlier this year he was
vacating the seat to run for the Senate, but dropped out of the
Senate race and re-entered the House race in June when Kohl
announced his candidacy.
   With 226 of 262 precincts, or 86 percent, reporting, Moody had
40,633 votes, or 58 percent; Matt Flynn, former state Democratic
chairman, had 16,805 votes, or 24 percent; Donald Sykes, former
director of an anti-poverty agency in Milwaukee, had 4,664 votes,
or 7 percent; former state lawmaker and perennial candidate Roman
Blenski had 440 votes, or 1 percent.
   Two candidates dropped out of the race when Moody re-entered,
but remained on the ballot. Milwaukee County supervisor Terrance
Pitts had 4,664 votes, or 7 percent, and former county circuit
Judge Frederick Kessler had 2,127 votes, or 3 percent.
   The district has been a stronghold for the Democrats, but
Republicans have tried to mount a legitimate threat.
   With all 262 precincts reporting, Helen Barnhill, a black
businesswoman, won the GOP nomination with 13,513 votes, or 68
percent; environmental activist Janette Marsh had 6,341 votes, or
32 percent.

   The scramble for Democratic nomination for the seat held for 31
years by Proxmire, 72, was triggered by his surprise announcement
last year that he would not seek re-election.
   ``I'd be 79 before the end of my next term,'' Proxmire explained
to disappointed Democrats.
   Ironically, campaign spending became a major issue among
Democratic contenders for the right to succeed Proxmire, a
gregarious hand-shaker whose low-budget re-election campaigns and
congressional budget-cutting efforts in won widespread popularity.
   Kohl, 53, a former chain store owner who was making his first
bid for public office, outspent his three opponents combined _ more
than $2 million to approximately $431,000 by Earl, $360,000 by
Garvey and $15,500 by La Follette, as of Aug. 24, Election Board
records showed.
   ``Politics should be people, ideas and leadership, not
multi-million-dollar TV hype,'' said La Follette, who said his
low-budget campaigns more closely resembled those by the
indefatigible Proxmire.
   When he easily won re-election six years ago, Proxmire spent
$145.10, he said, some of it for postage to return contributions.
   Like the 52-year-old Earl, Garvey, 48, sought to bounce back
from a 1986 defeat. Although an underdog, Garvey former executive
director of the National Footbal League Players Association, came
close to upsetting Republican Sen. Robert W. Kasten two years ago.
   La Follette, 48, a three-term secretary of state and former
state senator from Kenosha, lost a 1978 bid for lieutenant governor.
   In the GOP race, King, 47, a former FBI agent and one-time
chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, sought to pin a
liberal tag on Engeleiter, 36, a veteran of 11 years the
Legislature and the Senate's minority leader.
   King once served as an aide to then-U.S. Attorney General John
Mitchell before the Watergate scandal unfolded in the Nixon
administration. He stressed his opposition to a tax increase and
abortion and his support for the death penalty.
   Engleiter, who said she had the backing of a far broader segment
of the party, stressed she had spent much of her legislative career
fighting against increased taxes.

   Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger and
Democratic-Farmer-Labor challenger Hubert H. Humphrey III won
nomination handily in primaries Tuesday.
   Durenberger, 54, who was first elected in 1978, was opposed by
John J. Zeleniak, 78, of Columbia Heights, a retired physicist, and
Sharon Anderson, 49, of St. Paul, who has run unsuccessfully for
several offices.
   With 94 percent of the 4,086 precincts reporting, Durenberger
had 100,771 votes or 93 percent, to Anderson's 5,000 votes, or 5
percent, and Zeleniak's 2,178 votes, or 2 percent.
   Humphrey, 46, the state attorney general who is the son of the
former vice president and U.S. senator, had 144,250 votes, or 91
percent, against Kent S. Herschbach, 41, of Mendota Heights. The
truck driver and supporter of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche
received 14,609 votes, or 9 percent.
   Humphrey's campaign manager, Joe Tessmer, said the primary
results ``show voter confidence in the Humphrey candidacy.''
   ``There are two polls that count, the first on primary day and
the second on Election Day,'' he said. ``We're happy, that in the
first one that counts, we won and we won handily.''
   Durenberger was in Washington, D.C., where Congress was in
session, and voted by absentee ballot.
   ``The primary vote is an important step in the process,''
Durenberger said in a statement released by his campaign office.
``But I won't get into full-time campaigning until sometime in
October (after Congress adjourns). I always appreciate the people
who get out to vote in the primary, even though it's not as
exciting as the general election.''
   Leon Oistad, Durenberger's campaign manager, said he had seen no
campaign activity by either of the Republican challengers.
   Both Durenberger and Humphrey launched television advertising
campaigns earlier this month, with Durenberger stressing his
foreign policy experience and Humphrey emphasizing his concern for
family and children.
   Humphrey, Minnesota's attorney general since 1983, has trailed
Durenberger in public opinion polls by up to 19 percentage points,
although no independent poll results have been available since May.
Durenberger also has led Humphrey by a 2-1 margin in fund-raising
and his campaign expects to spend about $6.5 million to Humphrey's
$3.5 million to $4 million.

Out</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle is not exactly a
stand-up comic, but with some punchy one-liners the Republican vice
presidential nominee is getting his licks in against Michael
Dukakis' positions on defense.
   Until recently, Quayle's message was obscured by questions about
his own military posture and it was no laughing matter for his
campaign. But aides were delighted Tuesday at the attention Quayle
got when he delivered some wicked lines that ridiculed the
Democratic presidential nominee and provoked the Dukakis camp into
saying that the young Indiana senator was merely acting his age.
   Nearly a month ago, with his vice presidential campaign only
hours old, Quayle was mired in questions about whether his hawkish
image jibed with another image of him as a draft dodger.
   On Tuesday, Quayle was the GOP ticket's attack man, portraying
Dukakis as weak on defense and inexperienced in foreign policy
matters.
   ``Want to hear a sad story about the Dukakis campaign?'' Quayle
told supporters in a Milwaukee suburb.
   ``The governor of Massachusetts, he lost his top naval adviser
last week. His rubber duck drowned in his bathtub,'' Quayle said,
as the audience roared.
   Later, in Bismarck, N.D., Quayle joked that the Massachusetts
governor's experience in foreign policy was limited to dealing with
the governor of neighboring New Hampshire.
   The jokes got newspaper ink and even some time on the network
news. Quayle's campaign was pleased.
   ``People are now seeing an articulate, humorous individual who
has used his time in the Senate and the House to be an expert on
defense, foreign policy and national security issues,'' said David
Prosperi, Quayle's spokesman.
   Campaign strategists have long touted Quayle's defense expertise
as one of his assets. He has been a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee for eight years and has been deeply involved in
NATO issues, among others.
   But getting that message out has been difficult.
   A speech last week in Chicago, for example, was supposed to be a
major display of Quayle's ``stuff,'' as Prosperi put it.
   But Quayle tossed out the text, preferring to speak from
notecards and ended up making a confusing statement about offensive
and defensive weapons and evoking novelist Tom Clancy on
anti-satellite testing.
   Quayle's opposition to legislation to make the Veterans
Administration a Cabinet-level department also became a distracting
issue. Some saw the vote as anti-veteran.
   That, together with allegations he pulled strings to get into
the National Guard during the Vietnam War dogged Quayle almost from
the moment he left New Orleans as George Bush's running mate.
   A hawkish conservative in Congress, Quayle denied using his
wealthy family's influence 20 years ago to avoid combat, and
indignantly defended as honorable and patriotic his Guard service.
   Throughout the first weeks of his campaign, Quayle found himself
repeating, ``No rules were broken'' to reporters who questioned him
at almost every stop.
   That has not happened for some time, although Quayle also has
not held a news conference since Sept. 1.
   Aides say they believe he may have succeeded in finally getting
the debate focused on the issues, not his past.
   ``It's a continuation of our strategy that now is starting to
get a lot more attention because all the diversions basically have
blown away,'' Prosperi said.
   The strategy is to portray Dukakis as ``dangerously naive'' on
defense matters, blasting his opposition to the MX and Midgetman
weapons.
   Quayle on Tuesday described the Democratic nominee as ``the most
anti-defense candidate on a national level since George McGovern.''
   He said it was ``shocking'' that Dukakis had found it necessary
to receive defense briefings over the weekend from members of
Congress.
   ``You don't learn what you need to know about the national
security of our nation in one weekend cram course,'' Quayle said.
   He was cheered by the heartily supportive audiences on this
Midwestern swing. The only discordant note came from a group of
disgruntled veterans at a rally in Grand Junction, Colo. For them,
at least, the veterans were still an issue.
   ``What about veterans benefits?'' one asked as Quayle made his
way shaking hands.
   Replied Quayle, ``I'm for them.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge approved nearly all of an
$8.75 million jury award to a woman whose lawsuit against G.D.
Searle & Co. said the manufacturer's Copper-7 intrauterine device
left her sterile.
   However, in his ruling Tuesday U.S. District Judge Robert Renner
lowered the award to Esther Kociemba for emotional distress from $1
million to $400,000, based on state law limiting such awards to the
lower figure.
   Renner upheld a $7 million punitive damage award and a $750,000
damage award for pain and suffering.
   In its verdict Friday, the jury found that the Copper-7 was not
properly tested, that Searle failed to warn about risks connected
with the birth-control device and that the company intentionally
misrepresented the IUD.
   The jury found that Searle was not negligent in designing or
manufacturing the Copper-7.
   Searle plans to submit motions Oct. 4 that the verdict be set
aside and for a new trial ``based on evidentiary and other
errors,'' spokeswoman Kay Bruno said from company headquarters in
Skokie, Ill.
   Searle already said it will appeal the verdict.
   Roger Brosnahan, one of Kociemba's attorneys, said the judge's
action was ``largely pro forma.''
   ``It certainly is one more step toward, we hope, Searle
recognizing the seriousness of the problem,'' Brosnahan said. ``We
hope someone in that company or Monsanto (Searle's parent company)
will hear the clear message that the jury and the court has given.''
   Brosnahan said last week that the verdict marked the first time
a jury awarded punitive damages against Searle for a
Copper-7-related illness and that it was the largest award.
   About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most
widely used IUD in the United States before it was withdrawn from
the U.S. market in January 1986. Searle won 14 of the previous 17
cases to be decided.
   Mrs. Kociemba, of Elk River, had sought $15 million in punitive
damages, $1.5 million to $2 million in compensatory damages and
$300,000 in compensatory damages for her husband, William. The jury
declined to award him any money.

<HEAD>U.N. Asks Iraq To Allow Check Of Chemical Warfare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar requested that Iraq allow a team of specialists to
investigate claims by the United States and others that Baghdad
used poison gas to crush a Kurdish rebellion.
   Also Tuesday, Secretary of State George Shultz said Iraq is
using such chemical weapons against the Kurds. He said the U.S.
conclusions were based on a U.S. examination of Kurdish refugees
inside Turkey and on ``other evidence which to me seems to be
compelling.''
   ``I feel our evidence is quite convincing,'' he said. ``But
we're not in a position to make that public.''
   Perez de Cuellar conveyed the request of 10 governments for a
U.N. investigation to Iraq's charge d'affaires, Ali Mahmoud
Sumaida, on Tuesday, said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes.
   The nations making the request are the United States, Japan,
Britain, Italy, West Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and
Iceland, she said.
   Iraq has denied it used gas against the minority Kurds but has
previously acknowledged using chemical weapons against Iran in
their nearly 8-year-old war that led to a cease-fire last month.
   The 1925 Geneva Protocol bans use of chemical or biological
weapons, although their manufacture and stockpiling is allowed as a
deterrent against attack.
   Also Tuesday, a high-ranking Iraqi official acknowledged his
government is moving many Kurds from small villages for security
reasons or to provide better services, but he said it is not trying
to wipe them out or change their way of life.
   Kurdish rebel groups and others have denounced Iraq's policy of
demolishing small villages and relocating their population.
   But the official, Nizar Hamdoon, deputy foreign secretary and
former Iraqi ambassador to the United States, said in an interview
that the government has no intention ``to change the life of the
Kurds.''
   Asked about reports of widespread relocations, he said: ``If
you're talking about the border area, the reasons are mainly
security reasons, so that (rebel) infiltration stops.
   Iraq grants its 2.5 million to 3 million Kurdish inhabitants,
who live mainly in the north, a form of regional autonomy,
including their own assembly and use of the Kurdish language.
   Rebel groups demand wider autonomy or creation of an independent
state. An additional 6 million Kurds live in Turkey, Iran, the
Soviet Union and Syria.
   About 60,000 Kurds, many suffering chemical injuries, recently
fled Iraq to Turkey and said they did so because of chemical
attacks. The Kurds claim Iraq used the chemical weapons as part of
an offensive against the Kurds.
   An investigating team would need Iraq's permission to enter the
country, and failure to cooperate could hurt its international
standing.
   In London, the British Foreign Office said it toughened its
stand Monday partly because of the U.S. State Department evidence
of Iraqi chemical attacks on the Kurds.
   The evidence led the U.S. Senate on Friday to vote for tough
economic sanctions against Iraq. The Senate also suggested the
Iraqi relocation of Kurdish population was connected with
``genocide'' against the Kurdish people.
   The measure still must be approved by the House and signed by
President Reagan.

   Rep. Judd Gregg defeated two rivals in the
Republican gubernatorial primary Tuesday for the right to face
unopposed Democratic candidate Paul McEachern in the race to
succeed outgoing Gov. John Sununu.
   ``This is the first act of a two-act American drama,'' Gregg
said as he declared victory just after 9 p.m. Gregg immediately
launched an offensive against McEachern, whom he painted as a
free-spending liberal.
   ``We will show the people of New Hampshire what deep
philosophical differences there are ... a choice between fiscal
restraint and liberal spending,'' Gregg said.
   Gregg, a four-term congressman, easily outdistanced former
Manchester Mayor Robert Shaw and political neophyte William
Lawrence, a quality-control engineer from Hollis.
   With 266 of 298 precincts reporting, Gregg had 60,234 votes, or
79 percent, to 13,737 votes for Shaw, or 18 percent, and 2,330
votes for Lawrence, or 3 percent.
   Chuck Douglas, a former state Supreme Court justice, won a
bitter contest with former state Rep. Betty Tamposi in a six-way
GOP contest to succeed Gregg in the 2nd District.
   With 151 of 178 precincts reporting in that district, Douglas
led with 47 percent to Tamposi's 41 percent. The remainder was
split among Gregg's cousin, Stephen Gregg of Holderness; state Rep.
Alf Jacobson of New London; Peterborough magazine editor Dennis
Allen; and Milford restaurateur Andrew Tempelman.
   Nashua Mayor James Donchess defeated former state Rep. Barbara
Underwood for the Democratic 2nd District nomination by a 66
percent to 26 percent margin, with Lewis du Pont Smith trailing
with 8 percent.
   City clerks described turnout as dismally low. They blamed rain
and a lack of exciting contests.

<TEXT>
   Gregg, son of a former governor, entered the gubernatorial race
when Sununu, a national co-chairman of George Bush's presidential
campaign, decided not to seek a record fourth two-year term.
   McEachern, a lawyer, campaigned as a staunch opponent of the
troubled Seabrook nuclear power plant. In 1986, he ran a fairly
close race against Sununu.
   Douglas accused Tamposi, daughter of a millionaire real estate
developer, of using her wealth to try to buy the election. Tamposi,
initially said she would not bankroll her campaign, but ended up
lending it $150,000.
   Though he stopped short of formally endorsing Tamposi, Sununu
sent thousands of letters and made television spots for her.
Douglas won endorsements from nationally known conservatives
including Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and
Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire.
   Humphrey created an uproar last week when he said Tamposi
shouldn't run for Congress because she has a 22-month-old daughter
to take care of. Humphrey apologized two days later.

<TEXT>
   Suspected Sikh militants opened fire on a
crowd of laborers at a grain market in the northern Indian state of
Punjab, killing at least 20 people and wounding 60, police said
today.
   J.P. Virdhi, senior superintendent of police for the Patiala
district, said 10 or 12 militants with cloth masks on their faces
entered the main grain market in Sirhind town late Tuesday, turned
off the power supply and then began firing indiscriminately.
   Sirhind is a medieval town 119 miles southeast of Amritsar.
   Seventeen people died on the scene and three died later in
hospitals, Virdhi said in a telephone interview. Of those killed,
14 were Hindus, four were Sikhs and two Christians, he said.
   Of the injured, 20 were in serious condition in hospitals,
Virdhi said. said. Seven women and five children were among others
injured.
   The victims were mostly laborers from the eastern state of Bihar
who were working late into the night loading grain.
   Laborers come from throughout India to work in Punjab because
they can receive higher wages in the state, the most fertile and
agriculturally productive in the country.
   After shooting for nearly 15 minutes into the crowd with
Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles, the attackers left on
motorcycles and motor scooters, Virdhi said.
   Sikh militants have been agitating for a separate homeland since
1982, claiming discrimination by the majority Hindu community which
forms more than 80 percent of India's population.
   The killings Tuesday raised the death toll in this year's bloody
Sikh campaign to 1,920. Most of the victims have been civilians,
more than half of them moderate Sikhs who oppose the campaign for a
Sikh homeland.
   Sikhs form less than 2 percent of India's population of 800
million, but they are in a majority in Punjab.

<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq agreed to recess their stalled peace
talks and resume them in New York, according to a U.N. mediator,
but Baghdad balked at a proposed meeting date this month.
   A U.N. mediator said he hoped to come up with a meeting date
today.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed the
temporary move to New York in the hope of unblocking the
U.N.-mediated negotiations which opened in Geneva almost three
weeks ago.
   The agreement to pick up talks ``shortly'' in New York was
announced Tuesday by U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson, appointed by Perez
de Cuellar last week to oversee the talks in his absence.
   The U.N. chief invited the foreign ministers of the two nations
to meet at U.N. headquarters in New York on Sept. 22, but the Iraqi
delegation announced that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz could not be
in New York before the first week of October.
   The Iraqis also said they agreed to attend one meeting in New
York only if, before leaving Geneva, a firm date was fixed for
returning.
   The Iraqis' hardline stance was spelled out in a press statement
Tuesday night.
   Eliasson sought to play down the problem, calling the question
of dates a ``technical, secondary issue.'' He told journalists it
could be solved in a ``smooth, undramatic manner'' and indicated he
hoped this could be done by today.
   ``The main thing is the acceptance (by both sides) of a meeting
in New York shortly ... and of the subsequent continuation of the
talks in Geneva,'' he said.
   He told a news conference earlier that both sides ``seem
committed to keep the peace process going.'' He said they also
pledged to continue to observe the cease-fire, which went into
effect Aug. 20 after eight years of fighting and an estimated 1
million dead.
   The Swedish diplomat acknowledged, however, that on ``issues of
substance, there has been little, if any, progress.''
   But he said the essential thing was that the ``peace process is
kept alive.''
   The talks have bogged down over differing priorities. Iran wants
the negotiations to stick to the U.N. cease-fire resolution,
starting with withdrawal of all troops to internationally
recognized borders.
   Iran holds that these borders were delineated in a 1975 treaty
between the two countries. Iraq renounced the accord in 1980
shortly before invading Iran, but Iran says the unilateral
repudiation violates international law.
   Iraq wants the talks to focus immediately on clearing the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway of silt and sunken wreckage. The waterway
provides Iraq with its main outlet to the sea.
   Iraq also wants immediately to discuss freedom of navigation in
the Persian Gulf.
   Iran says these are secondary issues that could be dealt with
after the cease-fire resolution is put into full effect.

<HEAD>Dead Drifter Haunted by His Role In My Lai Massacre</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents of 7th graf, `On the ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drifter found dead 1{ weeks ago following an
argument with his girlfriend over a bottle of vodka was haunted by
his role in the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War, relatives
say.
   ``He actually was a casualty of the war,'' said Rebecca
T'Souvas, estranged wife of Robert W. T'Souvas. ``He had such
problems from what was wrong in Vietnam. Nothing was ever right for
him.''
   ``He was just a weak person,'' she said. ``I'm sure it was
because of Vietnam and because of what he had to endure there. But
he was a gentle man and a very good person when he was not under
the influence.''
   Robert T'Souvas, 39, was shot to death Sept. 3 beneath the
Smithfield Street Bridge in downtown Pittsburgh.
   His girlfriend, Kathlynn T'Souvas, 36, who took his last name
even though he never divorced Rebecca T'Souvas, has been charged
with criminal homicide and is being held without bail at the
Allegheny County Jail. A coroner's inquest is scheduled for
Thursday.
   Army Spec. 4 T'Souvas, then 19 and a high school dropout in San
Jose, was a member of one of three platoons that entered the
village of My Lai on March 16, 1968, where, he told an Army hearing
in 1970, he saw about 30 bodies, ``old men, women and children.''
   ``On the way out, T'Souvas saw two small children lying in the
road with their intestines hanging out,'' said his attorney, George
T. Davis of Mauna Lani, Hawaii. ``In an emotional reaction, he took
his M-16 and killed both to put them out of their misery.''
   The Army charged T'Souvas with premeditated murder of two
unidentified Vietnamese with a machine gun. He was one of nine
enlisted men charged in the massacre, in which more than 100
civilians were killed.
   After two soldiers were acquitted at courts-martial, charges
against T'Souvas and the six others were dropped. All were given
honorable discharges.
   Army Lt. William Calley was convicted of killing at least 22
civilians at My Lai. President Richard Nixon reduced Calley's life
prison sentence to 20 years. Calley served three years under house
arrest at Fort Benning, Ga. He was released when his conviction was
overturned by a federal district judge, and he was not returned to
house arrest when an appeals court reinstated the conviction.
   While awaiting trial at Fort McPherson, Ga., T'Souvas lived in
an Atlanta hippie commune, where he met his wife, according to
family members. Both later spent time in jail on marijuana charges
before they moved to California, the relatives said.
   They raised two children and T'Souvas worked in a bakery and at
various jobs before their marriage broke up, Lynn T'Souvas, an
aunt, said.
   About four years ago, he met Kathlynn, a carnival worker.
   ``She liked alcohol and was his drinking companion,'' said his
father, William T'Souvas, of San Jose, Calif.
   Police said the couple's trailer burned down and they left
California in August 1987 for Pittsburgh, where T'Souvas hoped for
a construction job.
   Police said Kathlynn's diary showed they lived in the van, often
parking it near Three Rivers Stadium, as they fished in the rivers,
sold their blood for money and worked part-time in a food kitchen
for the unemployed and the homeless.
   After the van broke down this summer, they built a makeshift
shelter on the banks of the Monongahela River, police said.
   On Sept. 3, police said, the T'Souvases and another homeless
man, David Bozic, 42, spent the day drinking, fishing and using
Bozic's .22-caliber pistol to shoot rats and cans under the bridge.
   While Bozic went to get food, police said the couple argued over
a bottle of vodka T'Souvas held between his legs. Police said the
woman took Bozic's gun and shot T'Souvas once in the head.
   William T'Souvas said he last talked to his son a few days
before the shooting.
   ``I just tried to tell him to put it together and come home,''
he said. ``I sent him some money, but he never came.''

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, while
share prices inched up on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 133.45 yen, up 0.38 yen from Tuesday's
close of 133.07 yen. After opening the day's session at 133.47 yen,
the currency was traded in a range between 133.33 yen and 133.65
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 37.42-point
winner Tuesday, gained 11.51 points or 0.04 percent to close
trading at 27,805.67. The main index gained 99.78 points to move to
27,893.94 shortly after the start of morning trading began, but
then went into a decline to finish slightly above the previous
day's close.
   Exchange dealers attributed the dollar's rise to dollar-buying
by investors who expect the U.S. trade deficit to decrease. They
added the overall market mood was cautious.
   The U.S. Commerce Department was scheduled to announce the July
trade figure later Wednesday in Washington.
   Share prices rose in the wake of a slight overnight gain on Wall
Street.
   ``But the Tokyo trading is quite active, as investors started
buying steel issues that let the (Nikkei) index to rise,'' said an
analyst at Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage firm.
   ``Active trading, despite a wait-and-see mood among investors,
showed the market's strength,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

   House Speaker Joe Lane was in a tight battle with
two backers of former Gov. Evan Mecham in early returns Tuesday
from a primary election that the ousted governor vowed would be a
``revolutionary step at the ballot box.''
   Lane, Lloyd Fenn and Warren Shumaker were virtually deadlocked
with 26 of 58 precincts reporting. A fourth candidate, Gerald
Patton, trailed with 14 percent.
   ``If I lose tonight it's Mecham that did it,'' Lane said
Tuesday. ``But I don't think it'll happen. I think I'll win all
right; it might not be an easy one.''
   Mecham, who predicted Monday that Lane would lose either the
primary or general election, said Tuesday night, ``I think we'll be
in for some surprises probably before the night is over. When it's
over there will be quite a number of changes; nobody will get
everything they want.''
   In other returns, Senate President Carl Kunasek was running
ahead of Jerry Gillespie, an ultra-conservative Mecham backer. But
some other senators who voted to oust Mecham were running behind.
   ``I think this is going to be the demise of the Mecham gang
myself,'' Lane, who represents a district in southeastern Arizona,
had predicted Monday. ``But I wouldn't bet any money on it because
I've been surprised once before by the Mecham folks.''
   Kunasek said Monday he was optimistic but added, ``At times I
get very depressed. I'm just resigned to whatever fate they (the
voters) produce.''
   The Mecham supporters were banking on voter dissatisfaction over
the former governor's April 4 Senate impeachment conviction and an
election-year tax hike approved by the GOP-dominated Legislature to
meet a massive budget deficit.
   Mecham predicted Friday that Lane would be defeated and said,
``I think we'll see a bigger change than we've ever seen before
.... I think that is a revolutionary step at the ballot box.''
   One pro-Mecham candidate was his former press secretary, Ron
Bellus, who ran against former Senate President Leo Corbet in
north-central Phoenix. Bellus said he did not know what a
``Mechamite'' was, adding that he represented new ideas and that
Corbet was a ``good old boy'' of Arizona politics. Early returns
showed Corbet with a 2-1 lead over Bellus.
   Sen. John Hays, a rural lawmaker who voted to oust Mecham, was
running ahead of pro-Mecham challenger Shirley Mac-Noye. GOP Sens.
Bill DeLong and Doug Todd, who also voted to convict the former
governor, also had early leads.
   But Sen. Peter Kay of Phoenix and Sen. Jack Taylor of Mesa, both
of whom voted to oust the governor, were running behind their
rivals in early returns.
   Also on Tuesday's ballot were two congressional races.
   In District 1 in eastern Maricopa County, Democrat John Fillmore
defeated rival Thane Read for the right to challenge first-term
Republican Jay Rhodes in November. With 325 of 417 precincts, or 78
percent, reporting, Fillmore had 16,163 votes, or 76 percent, to
Read's 4,971 votes, or 24 percent.
   In southern Arizona's District 5, two-term incumbent Jim Kolbe
easily defeated his challengers.
   With 68 of 360 precincts reporting, or 19 percent, Kolbe had
6,591 votes, or 78 percent, to political newcomer Walt Weber's
1,017 votes, or 12 percent; Alberto Rodriguez, a Mecham appointee
for state liquor superintendent whose controversial nomination was
withdrawn, had 831 votes, or 10 percent.

   Republican Rep. Judd Gregg said he would
depict his Democratic opponent for governor, Paul McEachern, as a
free-spending liberal in the fall campaign beginning today after
Gregg's victory in a three-way primary.
   ``We will show the people of New Hampshire what deep
philosophical differences there are ... a choice between fiscal
restraint and liberal spending,'' Gregg said.
   McEachern, a lawyer who ran a fairly close race for governor two
years ago, responded that the fight ``is going to be to show the
real Judd Gregg for who he is, as someone who has been voting
against our interests in Congress the last eight years and comes
back and wants us to elect a name to the seat. We're going to elect
a governor, not a name.''
   Gregg, a four-term congressman, overwhelmingly defeated former
Manchester Mayor Robert Shaw and political newcomer William
Lawrence, a quality-control engineer, in Tuesday's primary.
   With 266 of 298 precincts reporting, Gregg had 60,234 votes, or
79 percent, to 13,737 votes for Shaw, or 18 percent, and 2,339
votes for Lawrence, or 3 percent.
   Gregg, son of a former governor, got into the race after Gov.
John Sununu, a national co-chairman of George Bush's presidential
campaign, decided not to seek a fourth two-year term.
   In the 2nd District, where Gregg gave up his House seat, Chuck
Douglas, a 45-year-old former state Supreme Court justice, won the
Republican nomination. Nashua Mayor James Donchess, 39, is the
Democratic candidate.
   While Douglas was endorsed by nationally known conservatives
including Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,
Sununu sent campaign letters and made television spots for state
Rep. Betty Tamposi.
   Douglas accused Tamposi, daughter of a millionaire real estate
developer, of using her wealth to try to buy the election. She
loaned her campaign $150,000.
   ``It's important that we hold this seat,'' Douglas said after
his victory. ``It's important to the party, to New Hampshire and to
the conservative cause.''
   With 151 of 178 precincts reporting, or 85 percent, Donchess had
11,023 votes, or 66 percent, former state Rep. Barbara Underwood
had 4,297 or 26 percent, and Lewis du Pont Smith had 1,293, or 8
percent.
   Douglas led with 47 percent to Tamposi's 41 percent. The
remainder was split among Gregg's cousin, Stephen Gregg of
Holderness; state Rep. Alf Jacobson of New London; Peterborough
magazine editor Dennis Allen; and Milford restaurateur Andrew
Tempelman.

   Word from home was the most sought-after commodity
among groups collecting relief supplies for Caribbean islands
ravaged by one of the strongest hurricanes on record.
   Food, clothing and medical supplies for Jamaica and the Cayman
Islands were collected Tuesday in about a dozen locations across
southern Florida as Hurricane Gilbert and its 175 mph winds blew
toward Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
   ``The tension level is quite high. People want to hear from
their loved ones,'' said Ingrid Price, a Jamaican helping organize
relief efforts in Fort Lauderdale.
   Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga said late Tuesday at least
six people were killed and an estimated 60,000 were left homeless
in ``the worst natural disaster in the modern history of Jamaica.''
   Ms. Price said a team of about 30 doctors and health-care
workers were ready to head to Jamaica once clearance was given from
officials in Kingston, where workers tried to reopen the capital's
two airports and restore electrical and phone service.
   She added that at least $20,000 has been collected by the center
and several radio stations serving south Florida's estimated
150,000 Jamaicans.
   ``We will be willing to supply them with whatever they need,''
said Dr. Winston Alexis, who is heading the medical team.
   ``Everyone just wants to know about their families back in
Jamaica,'' said relief organizer Monica Mooah. ``There are many
very anxious people.''
   Three Air Jamaica planes full of supplies were ready to fly from
Miami International Airport to Jamaica once an airport there was
confirmed to be safe, said Rupert Williams, commander of the St.
John Ambulance Brigade of Jamaica's Army Medical Corps.
   The relief effort was being coordinated by the Jamaican
Consulate and Metro-Dade County, Kingston's ``sister city,'' he
said.
   On Tuesday, an Air Force C-130 plane with international and U.S.
officials aboard arrived in Jamaica to set up a satellite
communication system.
   Clint O'Neil, popular late-night reggae music disc-jockey on
WLRN in Miami, said many listeners have called seeking information
on relatives.
   ``I don't have much to tell them,'' he said. ``The
communications are still down. Nobody really knows how bad things
are.''
   The hurricane ``just souped up over the entirety of Jamaica.
There's no place on the island that escaped,'' said Percival R.
Todd, Jamaica's deputy consul-general in Miami.
   Charlie, the last major hurricane to strike the island directly,
killed 111 people in 1951, said Todd.
   In the Cayman Islands, a British colony, flood waters began to
recede Tuesday and phone service was restored to some sections,
said Gretchen Allen, former press secretary for the Cayman
government.
   ``There did not seem to be casualties and the island seem to
have took it very well,'' said Allen.
   On Tuesday, the Cayman government collected canned goods,
medical supplies and food at a special center set up near Miami
International Airport.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishop Denounces Killings, Government Says It Regrets
Attacks</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's military rulers expressed
regret over the killing of nine parishioners and fires that burned
down two Roman Catholic churches, but two opposition leaders blamed
the government for the violence.
   Also Tuesday, the church's Radio Soleil reported a militiaman
was acquitted in a November 1985 slaying which fueled public
outrage that led to the eventual ouster of dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
   A bishop meanwhile demanded justice for victims of the church
attacks.
   ``In the name of Jesus Christ, we say stop this destruction. We
condemn ... these criminal acts ... and demand justice for all the
victims,'' the Rev. Joseph Lafontant, auxiliary bishop of
Port-au-Prince, said on Radio Soleil Tuesday night.
   In other violence, Radio Haiti Inter said a group of
unidentified men in civilian clothes attacked Radio Cacique,
pillaging and carrying away its broadcasting equipment Tuesday
afternoon. Radio Cacique often broadcasts opinion.
   A statement from Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy's military regime was
broadcast by radio stations Tuesday, saying the government
``regrets the incidents ... in which the churches of St. Jean Bosco
and Immaculate Conception were burned.''
   Thugs armed with handguns and machetes attacked the congregation
of St. Bosco Church on Sunday during a Mass and burned down the
building. Radio Haiti Inter said three more bodies were discovered
Tuesday in the Port-au-Prince church, bringing the casualty toll to
nine dead and 77 wounded.
   The church's priest, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is an
outspoken critic of the military government and popular among
Haiti's poor. Aristide went into hiding right after the attack.
   Soldiers and police at a compound across the street from the
church watched the assault without intervening.
   On Monday, the Chapel of Immaculate Conception in the capital's
Cite Soleil slum burned to the ground.
   Five men and a woman appeared on government television Monday
boasting they had participated in Sunday's killings and warning
there would be ``heaps of corpses'' at future Masses.
   The six made no attempt to hide their identities and spoke on
the government-controlled network apparently without fear of arrest
or reprisals.
   They said they supported a rival priest, the Rev. Arthur Volel
of the Chapel of Immaculate Conception, but Volel denied such a
link on Tele-Haiti Tuesday night.
   ``The police (are) pursuing the culprits, among whom are the
self-proclaimed perpetrators who appeared on television,'' said the
government communique issued by the information ministry Tuesday.
   The statement said the military government condemned the
attacks, would open an investigation and ``sympathizes with the
families of the victims, the Salesian fathers and the Catholic
Church.''
   Both churches are led by priests of the Salesian Fathers, a
group specializing in vocational training.
   Namphy's government has issued similar statements in the past
following mass killings and other violence. But it has never
followed up with investigations or convictions.
   ``We are confronted by state banditry,'' said Jean-Jacques
Honorat, head of the Haitian Center for the Defense of Human
Liberties.
   Honorat and Sylvio Claude, head of the Christian Democrat Party
and one of Haiti's most popular opposition leaders, blamed the
government for the killing.
   Several witnesses on the scene of the attack against Aristide's
church say they recognized city hall employees among the
assailants, but Mayor Franck Romain denied the charges.
   Romain, Port-au-Prince mayor until Duvalier's ouster on Feb. 7,
1986, returned to that office in army-run elections in January, and
remained after Namphy ousted President Leslie Manigat in a coup on
June 19, ending four months of civilian rule.
   A criminal court in Gonaives meanwhile acquitted Cereste
Saint-Phard because of insufficient evidence after three of six
witnesses failed to appear at his trial, Radio Soleil said.
   Saint-Phard is an ex-member of the feared Tonton Macoutes, a
private militia of terror that kept the Duvalier family in power
for 29 years.
   He was charged with the shooting death of Jean-Robert Cius, one
of three high school students killed by Macoutes during an
anti-government demonstration.

   U.S. Rep. James Jeffords overcame a
conservative challenge in the Republican primary to become the
frontrunner in the general election race for retiring GOP Sen.
Robert Stafford's seat.
   Jeffords easily defeated political newcomer Michael Griffes, who
called himself the real Republican in the race, in Tuesday's GOP
primary.
   Jeffords will face former U.S. Attorney William Gray in the
November election. Polls have given Jeffords a big lead over Gray,
despite Vermont conservatives' complaints over Jefford's lack of
support for President Reagan.
   In 1981, Jeffords was the sole House Republican to vote against
Reagan's tax-cut package; In 1987, he had the second-highest
anti-Reagan voting record among Republicans in the House, as
analyzed by Congressional Quarterly magazine. He opposed the
president on 71 percent of the key votes.
   With 259 of 262 precincts reporting, Jeffords had 30,135 votes,
or 61 percent, to Griffes' 19,163 votes, or 39 percent.
   ``Mike Griffes and his people ran a very energetic campaign. I
commend them for this energy. I'm confident we can all work
together and win as a Republican Party,'' Jeffords told a packed
hall of supporters Tuesday night.
   Former Lt. Gov. Peter Smith easily won the GOP primary to run
for Vermont's lone House seat, which Jeffords is vacating. Four
Democrats sought their party's nomination, and Paul Poirier and
Peter Welch were locked in a close race with 99 percent of the
precincts counted early today.
   Poirier claimed victory, but Welch refused to concede.
   The major party winners will be joined on the November ballot by
Burlington Mayor Bernard Sanders, a socialist who is running a
strong independent campaign for the House seat, and candidates
representing the Liberty Union, the Libertarian Party and the Small
Is Beautiful Party.
   Democratic Gov. Madeleine Kunin, seeking her third term, was
unopposed in Tuesday's primary, as was her Republican challenger,
state Rep. Michael Bernhardt.

   George Bush has capitalized on the Pledge of
Allegiance and national defense as presidential campaign issues,
scoring enough points to pull ahead of Michael Dukakis in two
public opinion polls.
   Dukakis suffered his highest negative rating of the race in one
of the surveys released Tuesday, while in the other Bush was
favored by sizable margins on the issues he has been pressing most
strongly in the race.
   Bush led by eight points, 47 percent to 39 percent in a CBS
News-New York Times poll and 49 percent to 41 percent in a Gallup
poll. Two polls Monday had it closer, but two surveys last week
also put Bush ahead and found underlying movement toward him.
   A Los Angeles Times nationwide poll released today showed a dead
heat, with Bush and Dukakis both receiving 47 percent support among
the most likely voters. Among all registered voters who were
surveyed by the newspaper, 54 percent identified Bush as the
candidate who would best ensure a strong defense.
   In the Gallup poll, 68 percent had heard of Bush's criticism of
Dukakis for vetoing a law requiring teachers to lead classes in the
Pledge, and nearly half of them viewed Dukakis less favorably
because of it. The rest split between rating him higher and saying
it made no difference.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, has said he acted on the
basis of a court opinion that the law was unconstitutional. But in
the CBS-Times poll 70 percent said teachers should be required to
lead the pledge, and half of them said they felt that way even if
the requirement were unconstitutional.
   Bush also did well on defense: Twenty-eight percent said he
would make the nation stronger while only 4 percent said weaker. By
contrast, 39 percent said Dukakis would make U.S. defenses weaker,
and just 13 percent said stronger. The rest in both cases said
defenses would remain unchanged.
   Bush even out-polled Dukakis on competence, an issue the
Democrat had sought to make his own. Fifty-one percent said Bush
would be more competent at managing the federal government, while
32 percent chose Dukakis.
   The CBS-Times poll also found Bush ranked nearly even with
Dukakis on protecting the environment, an issue that traditionally
goes to the Democrats but that Bush has been stressing recently.
   Forty percent in the Gallup poll viewed Dukakis unfavorably
overall, up from 32 percent last month and the highest all year for
Dukakis in the poll. Dukakis was rated favorably by 53 percent, but
Bush won both ratings, with 59 percent favorable and 35 percent
unfavorable.
   Both candidates' confidence ratings declined in the CBS-Times
poll. Fifty-nine percent said they would be uneasy with Dukakis in
an international crisis, up from 53 percent last month. Forty-seven
percent said they would be uneasy with Bush, up 10 points.
   Bush scored worse than Dukakis on helping the middle class,
losing that rating 33-47. And Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana did poorly
as Bush's running mate: Just 32 percent said Quayle was qualified
to be president, while 58 percent said they would worry about him
stepping in if it were necessary.
   The CBS-Times poll was conducted among 1,043 probable voters
from Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points. The Gallup poll was done Friday through
Sunday among 1,003 registered voters and was given a 4-point margin
of error.
   The Los Angeles Times poll was conducted among 1,105 registered
voters from Friday through Sunday and included 656 voters described
as most likely to vote. The margin of error was 4 percentage points.

   Associated Press photographer Chris O'Meara
traveled to Jamaica with U.S. fire and other relief workers Tuesday
as the island nation struggled to recover from Hurricane Gilbert's
devastation. O'Meara spent 45 minutes Tuesday photographing areas
near the airport. The following is his description:
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The place was pretty hard hit from the
look of things from the air.
   Coming over the western part of the island, you could see the
trees were down, almost like dominoes. It was like a tornado went
ripping through there.
   Before we landed, they let two people hang with harnesses out of
the plane to get pictures of the island. The Red Cross people and
the foreign relief people said they were going to use the footage
to show how bad the island was really hit.
   We finally landed, and there were probably about 12 or 15
policemen and soldiers and some other people there to help out the
fire department.
   There was debris thrown up against the buildings and strewn
everywhere _ ventilation ducts, baggage carts. A couple of big
hangars had their roofs bent back. The terminal was flooded.
   There seemed to be a lot of flooding in the streets still. It
was still raining when we were there.
   Nobody was mentioning any casualties, but they were saying
things like, ``If you think this is bad, you should see the rest of
island.''
   It was getting dark when we left. You couldn't see any lights.
The island was totally dark, and so was the airport. There are no
landing lights at all. It looks very strange at night.
   The people seemed really happy to see the fire department. They
really need a lot there. There's no water, electricty or phones
right now, and no one's really sure when they will be restored.
   Before we left, one woman was pleading with us not to make it
look so bad because of the tourist industry.
   We took back two teen-age boys to Miami. They both seemed pretty
excited about going through a hurricane.

   Millionaire basketball team owner Herbert Kohl
and state Sen. Susan Engeleiter won easy primary victories and will
square off in November for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen.
William Proxmire, D-Wis.
   Kohl, a Democrat, and Engeleiter, a Republican, took early leads
Tuesday and never lost them.
   Kohl, 53, millionaire owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks, who is
making his first bid for public office, ended a political comeback
by former Gov. Anthony S. Earl in a five-way Democratic primary
Tuesday.
   ``The voters of Wisconsin said today they wanted a qualified,
non-politician with real-world business experience,'' said Kohl,
who spent more than $2 million in the primary campaign. ``They said
they wanted someone independent of political action committees who
would not take a penny from any of them.''
   Earl lost the governor's job two years ago to Republican Tommy
Thompson.
   With 98 percent of the vote counted, Kohl had 247,349 votes, or
47 percent, to Earl's 201,334 votes, or 38 percent. Former deputy
attorney general Edward R. Garvey had 54,649 votes, or 10 percent,
Secretary of State Douglas La Follette had 19,830 votes, or 4
percent, and Edmond Hou-Seye, a Sheboygan tire dealer, had 5,107
votes, or 1 percent.
   ``I think Herb Kohl (will) make a very strong and fine
Democratic candidate and outstanding U.S. senator,'' said Proxmire,
72, who is retiring in January after 31 years in the Senate. He
said Engeleiter is ``well qualified.''
   Engeleiter, 36, defeated Stephen B. King, former GOP state
chairman, and Peter Y. Taylor, to become the only woman nominated
by a major party for the U.S. Senate this year.
   She defeated King, 203,925 to 143,980 votes, or 57 percent to 40
percent. Taylor, of Milwaukee, had 8,7090 votes, or 2 percent.
   Engeleiter cited her 13 years in the Legislature and said her
campaign would emphasize her ``middle class values.''
   ``I understand far more than Herb Kohl ever can the needs of
middle-class Wisconsin,'' she said. ``I was raised middle class,
attend public schools and I know what it means to work hard for a
living for my family.''
   Democratic Rep. Jim Moody, the only Wisconsin congressman facing
primary opposition, easily won the nomination for a fourth term
from the 5th District, and will face GOP candidate Helen Barnhill,
a black businesswoman, on Nov. 8.
   Moody announced earlier this year he was vacating the seat to
run for the Senate, but dropped out of the Senate race and
re-entered the House race in June when Kohl announced his candidacy.
   With 100 percent of the precincts reported, Moody collected
47,346 votes, or 59 percent; Matt Flynn, a former state Democratic
chairman, had 19,756 votes, or 25 percent.
   Donald Sykes, the former director of a local anti-poverty
agency, had 5,298 votes, or 7 percent. Roman Blenski, a former
legislator and perennial candidate, had 565 votes, or 1 percent.
   Two candidates who dropped out of the race when Moody entered,
Milwaukee County Supervisor Terrance Pitts and former Circuit Judge
Frederick Kessler, picked up 4,957 votes, 6 percent, and 2,494
votes, 3 percent, respectively.
   On the Republican side, Barnhill had 13,513 votes, or 68
percent, with 100 percent of the precincts reported. Environmental
activist Janette Marsh had 6,341 votes, or 32 percent.
   Moody said he would not take anything for granted in his
campaign against Barnhill. ``She's a very serious candidate,'' he
said. ``I respect her a great deal.''
   Barnhill said her victory Tuesday was ``the first hurdle ... and
we'll be on our way in the morning.''

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen, while
stock prices rose slightly in cautious trading in Tokyo today,
traders said.
   The dollar closed at 133.45 yen, up 0.38 yen from Tuesday's
closing. After opening at 133.47 yen, the currency fluctuated
throughout the day, ranging between 133.33 yen and 133.65 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen rate did not move much due to two different
perceptions about the dollar's future,'' said Takamasa Yamazaki of
Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   ``But dollar-selling sentiment continued to prevail in the
market as participants waited cautiously for the release of U.S.
trade figure,'' Yamazaki said.
   U.S. trade figures for July are scheduled to be announced in
Washington later today.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues ended trading at 27,805.67, up 11.51 points or 0.04
percent from Tuesday's closing.
   The index rose quickly after the market opened, following a gain
in the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street overnight, and
managed to hold on to the gains in moderate to heavy trading.
   Despite a wait-and-see mood due to the upcoming U.S. trade
figures and a Japanese holiday Thursday, volume on the first
section reached the 1 billion share level for the first time since
Aug. 19, traders said.
   But they said few investors were eager to make significant moves
because the holiday would prevent the Tokyo market from responding
immediately to the U.S. trade figures. Thursday is Respect for the
Aged Day, a Japanese national holiday.

<HEAD>ABC Poll: Legalization Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine of 10 Americans reject decriminalizing all
illicit drugs, with a majority saying legalization would lead to
increased drug use, according to an ABC News poll.
   In addition, 70 percent of those polled said they want the
federal government to increase spending to prevent drug abuse.
   The legalization of marijuana was favored by 25 percent of those
polled, but only 7 percent favored the legalization of cocaine and
6 percent said heroin should be legal.
   The nationwide telephone poll of 509 adults conducted from Aug.
30 through Sept. 1 showed that 51 percent believed legalizing drugs
would lead to increased drug use. Eleven percent said use would
decrease and 38 percent said it would make no difference.
   Asked whether all illicit drugs should be legalized, 9 percent
said yes and 90 percent no.
   The margin of error for the poll, released Tuesday, was plus or
minus 5 percentage points.
   By a 2-to-1 margin, 47 percent to 23 percent, those polled said
legalization would lead to an increase in crime, not a decrease as
some have argued. Twenty-nine percent said it would have no effect.
   Majorities also rejected the arguments that legalization would
drive organized crime out of the drug business (64 percent) and
that it would make drugs less dangerous to users (55 percent).
   Asked which drug causes the most problems in society, those
polled said: cocaine, 28 percent; alcohol, 25 percent; crack, 25
percent; heroin, 6 percent, marijuana, 4 percent; and LSD, 1
percent.
   Twenty percent of those polled said drugs were the most
important problem facing the country, compared with 6 percent who
listed it No. 1 in an ABC News poll in October 1987.
   In the poll released Tuesday, unemployment, the budget deficit,
poverty and international affairs each were listed by 7 percent as
the most important problem facing the United States.

<HEAD>China Tightens Panda Loan Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China will sharply limit its loans of giant
pandas for foreign exhibit in an effort to halt commercial
exploitation of the rare animals, a Forestry Ministry official said
today.
   The official Xinhua News Agency meanwhile reported that all
loans of pandas and snub-nosed monkeys to the United States were
being suspended ``so as to protect the endangered species.''
   China, the only country where pandas live in the wild, estimates
that fewer than 1,000 remain, threatened by poachers and
deforestation.
   However, Zhang Yushan of the Forestry Ministry, which has charge
of conservation, said the new policy affects all countries, not
just the United States, and does not completely rule out future
loans.
   ``It's not that pandas absolutely can't go,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``It's just that such exhibits should be
controlled.''
   Zhang said if a foreign leader requests a panda loan, top
Chinese leaders may agree to enhance bilateral ties. However, he
declined to say under what other conditions pandas might be
released for exhibit abroad.
   ``We believe the fewer the better, and no exhibits at all would
be best,'' he said. China has been sending about four pairs of
pandas abroad each year, with foreign zoos competing fiercely for
the animals.
   Other officials contacted at the Forestry Ministry also refused
to spell out what the new policy would mean in practice or how it
would affect any such loans already approved.
   Regardless of how China will implement the new policy, its
effect on U.S. zoos is moot.
   In June, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suspended its
issuance of import licenses for pandas, scuttling planned exhibits
in Atlanta and at the Michigan State Fair. China had approved both
loans.
   The U.S. agency said it wanted to consider objections by
American conservation groups that the loans exploit pandas for
profit and interrupt efforts to breed them in China.
   China stopped giving gift pandas to foreign zoos in the 1970s
but requests for loans of pandas for temporary exhibits abroad have
multiplied in recent years.
   Six U.S. zoos as well as zoos in Belgium, Australia and Japan
have received separate pairs of loan pandas. Many more have asked,
using banquet diplomacy and high-ranking connections in an effort
to win Chinese approval.
   Zoos receiving loan pandas generally pay China $300,000 to
$500,000 but often take in much more than that in increased ticket
sales, prompting both the Chinese and the foreign zoos to accuse
each other of profiteering from the pandas.
   ``Foreign zoos often make a lot of money,'' Zhang said. ``We're
not saying they shouldn't make money, but there should be some
other reason for the exhibit.''

<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger and
Democratic challenger Hubert H. Humphrey III claimed their parties'
nominations in primaries that apparently set a record for voter
disinterest.
   ``It's real disappointing,'' said Secretary of State Joan Growe.
The 292,000-voter turnout was about 10 percent of the state's 3.1
million eligible voters _ apparently the lowest since the state
began keepinr records in 1950.
   Growe blamed the lack of voter participation on the absence of
serious challenges to either Durenberger or Humphrey, whose races
topped the ticket.
   Durenberger spent Tuesday in Washington, D.C., where Congress
was in session, and voted by absentee ballot in Avon, Minn.
   With 99 percent of the state's 4,079 precincts, Durenberger, 54,
who was first elected to the Senate in 1978, received 93 of the
vote in the Independent-Republican Senate primary with a 110,052
tally.
   Sharon Anderson, 49, of St. Paul, came in a distant second, with
5,426 votes or 5 percent. John J. Zeleniak, 78, of Columbia
Heights, a retired physicist, was in third place, with 2,388 votes
or 2 percent.
   Humphrey, 46, son of the former vice president and U.S. senator,
received 155,156 votes, or 91 percent, in the Democratic Farm Labor
Senate primary. His challenger, truck driver Kent S. Herschbach,
41, a supporter of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, received
15,927 votes, or 9 percent.
   Humphrey, a former state senator and Minnesota's attorney
general since 1983, said his primary victory, ``lets us go forward
directly again tomorrow.''
   ``I expect polling to go up and down a little more, and it's
going to close in very soon and it's going to be a horse race, and
I'm going to win,'' he said. ``I like winning elections.''
   Humphrey has trailed Durenberger by up to 19 percentage points
in public opinion polls, although no independent polls have been
released recently. He also has trailed Durenberger by a 2-1 margin
in fund-raising.
   Durenberger expects to spend $6.5 million in his re-election
bid, while the Humphrey campaign plans to spend $3.5 million to $4
million.
   The names of four other U.S. Senate candidates will appear on
the Nov. 8 general election ballot: Derrick P. Grimmer of the Grass
Roots Party, Wendy Lyons of the Socialist Workers Party, Arlen
Overvig of the Libertarian Party, and independent candidate Polly
Mann.

<HEAD>Arafat Ends 2-Day Visit To European Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan's King Hussein paved the way
for the creation of an independent Palestinian state when he
severed ties with the occupied West Bank, PLO chief Yasser Arafat
said.
   ``We are at a crucial stage,'' Arafat said in a speech Tuesday
to the European Parliament. ``The Palestinian state, the key to
peace, security and development in the Arab region ... is in the
offing.''
   Arafat is likely to discuss creation of a Palestinian state in
meetings today, the final day of a two-day visit, with the Greek
and French foreign ministers.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization chief told socialist
Parliament members that the Palestine National Council, a kind of
parliament-in-exile, would decide on a Palestinian state on the
West Bank. The Palestinian council is to meet next month in Tunisia.
   ``The only option left is the right, realistic and irreplaceable
one _ namely, the Palestinian option, the essence of which is the
independent Palestinian state,'' Arafat said at a closed-door
meeting with the European Parliament's 165-strong Socialist group,
the largest in the 518-member assembly.
   ``This state will have a republican, democratic and multiparty
system; it will abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and will not discriminate among its citizens on the basis of color,
race or religion,'' Arafat said.
   A test of his speech was released to reporters.
   Arafat said the PLO should represent the Palestinian people at
an international peace conference. Israel has rejected the idea and
refuses to talk to the PLO, which it views as a terrorist group.
   ``It would be possible at the said conference and through the
negotiations which will take place within its framework to discuss
and agree (on) arrangements for international guarantees of peace
among all states of the region, including the independent
Palestinian state,'' Arafat stated.
   Of King Hussein's decision July 31 to relinquish sovereignty
over the West Bank, Arafat said:
   ``The measures ended the European, American and Israeli debate
on Palestinian representation at the international conference. No
one can claim anymore that there is someone else to share with the
PLO the representation of the Palestinian people.''
   The PLO is seeking to form a provisional government or a
government-in-exile for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more
than 1.5 million Palestinians live.
   The territories, captured from Jordan and Egypt during the 1967
Middle East war, have been the scene of a Palestinian uprising
since last Dec. 8 in which more than 260 Palestinians and six
Israelis have died.
   Richard Balfe, a British Laborite who attended the session with
Arafat, said the PLO leader spoke in Arabic for about 40 minutes,
then fielded questions for another half hour.
   He said Arafat ``made it fairly clear that the recognition of
Israel was part of the negotiation'' at an international peace
conference.
   Lord Plumb, the Parliament president, met for 20 minutes with
Arafat before the meeting.
   He told reporters his message to the PLO leader was ``Get out of
violence, get into negotiations,'' and added he sensed Arafat was
in Strasbourg ``to move toward condemnation of violence.''
   But in Jerusalem, Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, said Arafat's address contained nothing new.
   ``It sounds like a rehashing of all his (Arafat's) ideas, the
main thing being that he still wants the disappearance of the state
of Israel. That's the crux of it ... I don't see anything new,''
Pazner said.

<HEAD>NBC to Interrupt Olympics for Live Presidential Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC will carry the first presidential debate
live, reversing an earlier decision and taking a potential $8
million loss when it interrupts its prime-time coverage of the
Summer Olympics.
   NBC President Robert C. Wright said Tuesday the change was made
because ``there is no more important news story than selecting the
40th president of the United States.''
   ABC and CBS have already said they would carry the Sept. 25
debate live.
   NBC had said last week when the date of the first debate between
Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
was announced that it would carry the debate on a tape-delayed
basis rather than interrupt the Olympics.
   On Tuesday, Wright issued a statement saying NBC would interrupt
the Olympics for 90 minutes for the debate, then return to Seoul,
bring viewers up to date and resume live coverage of the Olympics.
   ``There is no more important news story than selecting the 40th
president of the United States, and there is no more important
event than staging the 24th Olympiad. What to do? NBC has a rare
opportunity to provide our viewers both the debate and the
Olympics. We shall do just that,'' said Wright.
   NBC News President Michael Gartner said the change was ``an $8
million question, potential revenue loss of 8 million bucks. We
just decided that this was a terrible dilemma, and we would do our
best to try and cover both.''
   Olympic events that evening will include track and field,
cycling, swimming, basketball and boxing.

   Rusty Cline, one of the thousands
who narrowly escaped a wildfire, complained of dizziness, searched
for shoes, and cried that the flames that razed her home may have
killed her dog.
   Cline and her son were part of what American Red Cross worker
Elzabeth Quirk dubbed ``the morning of tears'' at an evacuation
center Tuesday in a Grass Valley high school.
   ``The fire raced in on us. We ran for the car, but it beat us
there,'' said Cline, 51, a resident of the tiny community of Rough
and Ready, three miles west of Grass Valley.
   She paused, weeping, then added, ``I couldn't get my dog in the
car. She was too scared.''
   Her son, Lee Griep, 29, had stopped in during a bicycle tour of
the nation that started from his home in Lakewood, Fla. The bicycle
burned in the fire.
   ``I rode out in a firefighter's jeep, we got separated from my
mom's car, and the fire swept right over us,'' he said.
   More than 1,200 fire refugees have passed through the center
since flames erupted Sunday, said Red Cross spokesman James Poole.
   About 70 spent the night on cots in a gymnasium Monday, he said.
Uncounted others slept in vehicles outside, at the homes of friends
or relatives and in motels that were filled up to 30 miles away.
   The estimated 8,000 evacuees have been able to return home, if
they found their homes still standing, authorities said. Nearly 100
houses were gutted.
   Other residents returned home only to be chased a second or
third time by the erratic, stubborn blaze in the drought-parched
hills of timber, oak and brush.
   Among the evacuees were Ed and Kathy Vierra, in their early 30s,
who lived in the open bed of their pickup truck with three young
children.
   ``Of course it's hard, but at least I know where my kids are,
where my husband is,'' she said, waving her hand at her family.
   A 40-foot section of wall at the center was plastered with
hundreds of messages, like ``Call if you need a place to stay'' or
``Just want to know you're all OK, couldn't get through on the
phone.'' Most just pleaded, ``Please call!''
   Nearby were piles of donated clothes and food. A children's
activity area was decorated with their drawings.
   Nurses at the medical station treated everything from scrapes to
headaches.
   Air tankers dropping fire retardant periodically thundered
overhead through the smoke, drowning conversation.
   Occasionally, word came in that another area was safe for
residents. Don Blicht, 56, of Rough and Ready, got that word and
immediately jumped in his recreational vehicle.
   ``We're headed back to see if the house is still there,'' he
said. ``I was hosing down the roof to put out cinders when we had
to leave. We left the chickens and everything.''
   Some of those who lost homes had insurance, those without may
have to depend on government and private aid.
   Cline, who had no insurance on her destroyed home, was asked
about the future.
   ``I have no idea,'' she said. ``I just don't know.''

<TEXT>
   _Murphy Morobe, 32, is acting publicity secretary of the United
Democratic Front and was detained in July 1987. Married, with two
children, he went underground after a state of emergency was
declared on June 12, 1986. During the next 13 months, he remained
active, often showing up unannounced and in disguise at newspaper
offices to give interviews or deliver press releases. He is
considered one of his group's most articulate speakers and writers.
He was imprisoned from 1977 to 1982 after he and other black
student activists from Soweto were convicted of sedition.
   _Mohammed Valli Moosa, 31, is acting general secretary of the
United Democratic Front. He and Morobe, who were detained together,
assumed their positions in 1985 after their predecessors were
arrested on treason charges in a case still pending in court.
   Valli Moosa, of Indian descent, was born in Johannesburg, but
his family was forced to move to a segregated, Asian suburb in 1964
under the terms of South Africa's Group Areas Act. He is married
and has one daughter. Prior to his detention, he visited Europe,
the United States and Canada on behalf of the United Democratic
Front.
   _Vusi Khanyile, 37, is chairman of the National Education Crisis
Committee and also was special assistant to the chief administrator
of the University of Cape Town. He is married, with three children.
He became involved in black student politics in 1972, and was
detained for five months in 1977-78. He received a bachelor's
degree in 1982 from the University of Birmingham in Britain.

<HEAD>THE ORGANIZATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The United Democratic Front was founded in 1983, primarily to
oppose a new constitution that brought Asians and people of
mixed-race into Parliament while continuing to exclude the black
majority. The front quickly established itself as the largest
anti-apartheid group in the country, a loose coalition of about 700
labor, civic, church and educational groups which up to 2.5.
million members. Most of the estimated 30,000 people detained for
varying periods since the 1986 emergency declaration have been
affiliated to the United Democratic Front, and the organization was
banned in February from conducting any activities.
   _The National Education Crisis Committee, also banned in
February, was formed in December 1985. Like the United Democratic
Front, it is a multiracial but predominantly black coalition. It is
composed primarily of parent, teacher and student groups seeking to
give blacks more control over curriculum and policies in their
schools. The committee was instrumental in calling off black
classroom boycotts that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the
government outlawed its subsequent campaign for ``people's
education'' and has detained virtually all its leaders.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A stationary front scattered rain from New Mexico to West
Virginia today and a thunderstorm associated with Hurricane Gilbert
produced rain and winds gusting to 58 mph at Key West, Fla.
   Gilbert, the strongest hurricane in history, was moving slowly
in the western Caribbean with winds up to 175 mph. Its only impact
on the continental United States so far occurred over the Florida
Keys, where the thunderstorm generated stiff gusts late Tuesday.
   The long stationary front dropped heavy rain on parts of New
Mexico, with Clayton getting 1.47 inches in six hours.
   The front also generated showers and thunderstorms over much of
Colorado, and scattered showers over west-central Texas,
southwestern Oklahoma, eastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia and
western Virginia.
   Clear skies prevailed across the rest of the nation. Early
morning temperatures ranged from the 40s and 50s across most of the
northern tier of the country to the 70s from the desert Southwest
and the Rio Grande Valley through the lower Mississippi Valley to
the southern Atlantic Coast. It was in the 80s in southern Florida.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
eastern New Mexico across northern Texas to the central Gulf Coast.
Showers also were predicted for the west-central Plains to the
central Plateau region, with snow at higher elevations in the
Rockies. Showers also were expected near the Canadian border from
New York state to Maine and in Florida.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 50s and 60s from the central
Plateau across the central Rockies to the South Dakota Black Hills
and the west-central Plains; in the 60s in northern Michigan,
northern New York state and northern New England; in the 90s from
the South Atlantic and Gulf Coast states to southeast Oklahoma and
eastern Texas, and the inland valleys of the West Coast states; and
near 100 degrees in the desert Southwest. Highs elsewhere were
forecast to be in the 70s and 80s.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 30 degrees at
Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 85 degrees at Homestead, Fla.

<HEAD>Stringham Beats Oliver In Democratic U.S. House Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Stringham, a retired steelworker,
narrowly defeated businessman Craig Oliver in the Democratic
primary race for the heavily Republican 3rd Congressional District.
   With all 463 precincts reporting in Tuesday's primary, Stringham
had 7,038 votes, or 52 percent, to Oliver's 6,483, or 48 percent.
   Stringham, who is chairman of the Utah County Democratic Party,
will face Republican Rep. Howard Nielson, the only congressman the
district has ever had. Nielson was unopposed for the GOP nomination
for a fourth term.
   ``I'm bouncing off the ceiling,'' Stringham said in victory.
``It was a long night, but we felt all the way along that we were
going to be victorious.''
   He vowed the same result against Nielson on Nov. 8, although
polls show the incumbent, a landslide winner in three previous
elections, with a comfortable lead over both the Democratic
contenders.
   Nielson, 64, remained confident of his re-election prospects as
a self-described ``top fiscal conservative in Congress.''
   ``I think I can win the election without much trouble,'' he said
in an interview from his home. ``But I'm still going to work hard.''

   A House subcommittee chairman is telling
Energy Department officials to ``do your homework'' before pushing
Congress to approve the opening of an underground nuclear waste
disposal facility.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., made the statement Tuesday after his
Government Operations environment, energy and natural resources
subcommittee was told that major questions remain about the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.
   The department wants to begin putting waste into the underground
facility next month, but it has not adequately proven that it can
operate it safely, according to witnesses and documents at the
hearing.
   Among those raising questions were the department's office of
safety appraisals, its Brookhaven National Laboratory and an
environmental consultant it hired to review WIPP.
   At the same time, the congressional General Accounting Office
said it would be premature for Congress to approve the Energy
Department's request to pass legislation needed to launch the $700
million project.
   ``There are many uncertainties involving WIPP performance that
must be addressed before DOE can demonstrate that the facility is
suitable,'' GAO's Keith Fultz said.
   Synar called the hearing to look into the department's plan to
place 125,000 barrels of so-called transuranic waste into the
repository 2,150 feet below the ground near Carlsbad.
   Transuranic waste, a byproduct of nuclear weapons production, is
a combination of radioactive material and a wide variety of
hazardous substances. The waste proposed for WIPP represents
approximately half the amount now stored above ground in about half
a dozen states.
   Synar said energy officials should ``go home and do your
homework and then come back and ask us for the legislation. Don't
put the cart before the horse. We're one month away from this
targeted (waste) loading and you can't justify this loading.''
   Jill Lytle, deputy assistant energy secretary for nuclear
materials, told Synar the agency plans to follow environmental laws
governing the disposal of dangerous waste during a five-year test
of the WIPP facility.
   ``WIPP will not endanger the safety and health of the public,''
she testified.
   A department spokesman said in an interview Tuesday night that
the repository is ready to begin receiving waste perhaps by the
beginning the year, but for four obstacles in the way. He said no
date has been set, however.
   ``We won't have an opening date until we have the resolution of
those four items. I think it's too strong to say the opening has
been postponed indefinitely. We're actively pursuing the opening of
WIPP,'' said spokesman Richard Marquez.
   He said nuclear waste containers must be tested, a five-year
plan for use of the facility and a site readiness review must be
performed before an opening date can be set. Congress must also
pass a bill withdrawing the WIPP land from public and mining uses.
   But in a memo written Sept. 2, James Knight, director of the
Energy Department's office of safety appraisals, said the
department's final safety analysis report lacks ``sufficient
information for us to independently conclude that the facility can
be operated safely.''
   In an August letter to Knight, a Brookhaven team that visited
WIPP said facility officials ``have not addressed issues associated
with either adequacy of the (plant's) design or the quality
assurance of the construction phase.''
   Lokesh Chaturvedi, the consultant, said energy officials had not
given him any data about what might happen to stored waste if the
facility was breached by a pressurized brine reservoir that appears
to exist about 800 feet below portions of the WIPP site.
   Chaturvedi, deputy director of the Environmental Evaluation
Group in Albuquerque, and Owen Thompson, a staff member of the
office of safety appraisals, also questioned the need to even put
barrels of waste into WIPP during the five-year test.
   ``The DOE describes WIPP as a research and development facility,
but we have not been able to receive a final plan of research
requiring waste emplacement,'' Chaturvedi said.
   Thompson said that because waste barrels are not expected to
leak during the five years, ``actual repository conditions are not
being evaluated and actual repository performance will not be
demonstrated.''
   The GAO's Fultz said he has been unable to resolve questions
about whether WIPP officials would be able to retrieve waste that
leaked from barrels and where any retrieved waste would be stored.

   In a primary that could be called ``Evan Mecham's
revenge,'' the Senate president, House speaker and five other
Republican incumbents who voted for the ex-governor's impeachment
were defeated in the first primary since his ouster.
   Senate President Carl Kunasek was beaten Tuesday by Mecham
supporter Jerry Gillespie in what some had viewed as a
David-and-Goliath race.
   House Speaker Joe Lane, a Republican who started the impeachment
process against Mecham last fall, lost to Mecham backers Lloyd Fenn
and Warren Shumaker. Two candidates were picked in each House race.
   ``If I lose tonight it's Mecham that did it, but I don't think
it'll happen,'' Lane said earlier.
   ``I think we'll be in for some surprises probably before the
night's over,'' Mecham told reporters as the results rolled in.
``When it's over there will be quite a number of changes. Nobody
will get everything they want.''
   Lane had predicted Monday that the primary would be ``the demise
of the Mecham gang. ... But I wouldn't bet any money on it because
I've been surprised once before by the Mecham folks.''
   House Majority Whip Jane Hull and Sens. John Hays and Doug Todd
_ all Republicans who voted to impeach or convict Mecham _ were
renominated.
   But Republican Sen. Peter Kay of Phoenix lost to Tom Patterson,
as did Sen. Jack Taylor. Both incumbents voted to convict Mecham.
   Reps. Bob Hungerford, Bob Broughton, Don Strauch, who voted for
impeachment, were defeated. Rep. Betty Rockwell, who cast her vote
for impeachment, was apparently renominated, but a recount was
expected.
   Sen. Wayne Stump of Phoenix, one of the former governor's
strongest supporters in the Senate, narrowly defeated challenger
Jack Kearney.
   Some key Mecham backers lost their bids for the Legislature. His
former press secretary, Ron Bellus, was trounced by former Senate
President Leo Corbet in north-central Phoenix.
   Trent Franks, a former House member who was named by Mecham to
head the Governor's Office of Children's Services, lost his House
bid, and Rep. Gary Giordano, a Mecham supporter, lost his north
Phoenix seat.
   The Mecham supporters were banking on voter dissatisfaction over
the former governor's April 4 Senate impeachment conviction and an
election-year tax hike approved by the GOP-dominated Legislature.
   Two lopsided congressional races completed Tuesday's ballot.
   In District 1 in eastern Maricopa County, Democrat John Fillmore
overwhelmed Thane Read for the right to challenge first-term
Republican Jay Rhodes in November. Fillmore garnered 20,720 votes,
or 76 percent, to Read's 6,469 votes, or 24 percent.
   In southern Arizona's District 5, two-term GOP incumbent Jim
Kolbe just as handily defeated his challengers, including Mecham's
controversial nominee for state liquor superintendent, Alberto
Rodriguez.
   Kolbe had 38,169 votes, or 78 percent, to political newcomer
Walt Weber's 5,855 votes, or 12 percent; Rodriguez, whose
nomination was withdrawn, had 5,077 votes, or 10 percent.

<HEAD>Two Consultants Sue Morton Thiokol over Challenger Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two safety consultants sued Morton Thiokol Inc.,
claiming they were fired for attempting to inform NASA about
problems involving solid-fuel rocket motors after the destruction
of space shuttle Challenger.
   Steven Agee of Renton, Wash., and Anthony Laine of Phoenix filed
separate suits Monday in federal court in Chicago seeking
unspecified damages. The suits allege wrongful termination,
defamation and violation of federal racketeering laws.
   Both men were hired as system-safety analysts for the booster
redesign program created after the January 1986 explosion that
killed Challenger's seven astronauts. The accident was blamed on a
faulty seal in a booster rocket.
   Agee, 45, worked at the rocket maker's plant in Utah from
November 1986 until March 1987. Laine started in January 1987 and
was fired the following month.
   Agee's suit alleges he wrote 221 catastrophic ``hazard
analyses,'' or ways that the rockets could fail, that Morton
Thiokol failed to forward to the National Aerospace and Space
Administration, which contracts with Thiokol to build shuttle
rockets.
   Agee's litigation asserts he was defamed when Thiokol falsely
told another prospective employer, the Boeing Co., that he was
fired because he got into a serious fight with one of his
supervisors at Thiokol.
   Laine contends he was ordered to cease an investigation of a
potential hazard in the booster rocket engine and had been told
that safety engineers were only to ``cut and paste old reports''
and not investigate any new potential safety problems.
   Thiokol falsely told NASA that Laine was fired for compiling
``classified information'' that he should not have had, thus
defaming him, the lawsuit indicates.
   The suits also assert that racketeering laws were violated when
Thiokol used the mails and telephones to file false reports with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its
contractual obligations with NASA.
   Morton Thiokol, whose corporate offices are in Chicago, was
named as a defendant along with five of the company's Utah-based
managers and Phoenix-based ARC Technical Services Inc., an
engineering personnel company through which Agee and Laine were
paid.
   Thiokol lawyer Darryl Lee said Tuesday he would have no comment
because he had not seen the complaints.
   Lawsuits filed by another former engineer, Roger Boisjoly, who
warned against the launching of the Challenger, were dismissed last
month by a federal judge in Salt Lake City.

   As Hurricane Gilbert's record-breaking
fury sends Caribbean islanders scrambling for cover, National
Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheets remained calm at his helm.
   The barometric pressure at the storm's center plummeted to 26.13
inches at 5:58 p.m. EDT Tuesday night, making Gilbert the most
intense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere in terms
of barometric pressure, but Sheets handled a mob of reporters with
ease.
   ``I've flown into 200 hurricanes. ... I really don't think this
is difficult,'' he said.
   With his schedule of interviews timed to the minute, Sheets
spent most of Tuesday on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters
beside a large monitor showing the destructive Gilbert in full
color sprawled across much of the western Caribbean.
   Rosy-cheeked and good-natured, Sheets was named acting director
during the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season and became director in
March.
   The transition from former director Neil Frank, widely known for
his distinctive style and flat-top haircut, to Sheets, his dark
blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a
gray wool-blend jacket, has been smooth.
   ``He knows his job very well and he's a calm personality,''
Vivian Jorge, the center's budget analyst, said of Sheets. On days
with especially active tropical weather, Ms. Jorge steps in to
coordinate media interviews.
   Interest in Gilbert has been high since it started packing
hurricane-force winds last weekend and by Tuesday night became a
Category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph.
   A Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength
has the potential for causing catastrophic damage with winds in
excess of 155 mph and pressure below 27.17 inches.
   Gilbert has been compared to the Labor Day hurricane of 1935,
which slammed into the Florida Keys and killed 408 people, and
Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969,
killing 256 _ the only other Category 5 storms to hit land this
century. The last major hurricane to make landfall was Elena in
1985, along the Mississippi, Alabama and Florida Panhandle.
   The major television networks, local stations and print media
were on hand to monitor the hurricane.
   The center's 33-member crew, including seven hurricane
forecasters and specialists, are keeping a close watch on the
hurricane in a large, open roomful of blue monitors flickering with
graphics.
   And while Sheets might appear to spend most of his day with tiny
microphones snaking down his back and fielding media questions, he
also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three
hours and makes hurricane forecasts.
   Dealing with a major hurricane isn't much different from dealing
with smaller ones or tropical storms, Sheets said, adding that
Gilbert has been particularly ``well-behaved.''
   ``It does what we think it's going to do,'' he said. ``You feel
a lot more confident about what you're doing than with weaker
systems.''
   His previous experience with hurricanes has served him well in
keeping off the pressure during these sometimes 18-hour days.
   ``I've done this for 25 years so at one stage you're prepared to
do it or not. ... I don't feel a lot of pressure,'' said Sheets,
while eating lunch.
   Sheets said he remains in touch with his predecessor, Frank, but
didn't get any special advice from his friend on dealing with his
high-visibility post at the hurricane center here.
   What's Frank, now a television forecaster for Texas station
KHOU-TV, doing now?
   ``He's getting geared up in Houston,'' said Sheets with a smile.

<TEXT>
   A mother and her three sons have been sentenced
to life in separate prisons for murdering three police officers
during a standoff at a motel.
   Judge Richard P. Hathaway on Tuesday said he wished he could
have imposed the death penalty on Alberta Easter and her sons,
George, Roy and William Lemons.
   First-degree murder carries an automatic sentence of life
without parole. The death penalty is forbidden under Michigan's
constitution.
   The judge sentenced the four to solitary confinement in separate
prisons.
   ``In this way, the defendants will understand the pain of
separation that the victims' families feel,'' he said, his voice
breaking in emotion and fading to a whisper.
   ``The actions on July 9 are a disgrace to the word `family.' I
only wish the victims' families could step forward and sentence the
defendants instead of the court.''
   Easter and her sons were convicted last month of murdering
Inkster Sgt. Ira Parker and Officers Clay Hoover and Daniel Dubiel
during an 11-hour siege in 1987. The trial lasted 14 weeks.
   Hoover, Dubiel and Parker had gone to the motel in the Detroit
suburb to serve a bad-check warrant on Easter and were taken
hostage. When the four surrendered, the officers were found dead of
multiple gunshot wounds.
   Easter and her sons maintained their innocence Tuesday.
   ``Our blood is on your hands. You pray for us and our lives,''
she said.
   ``I am sorry about the loss, but it wasn't our fault. Injustice
has been made legal,'' William Lemons said.

<TEXT>
   West German Rudolf Cordes, home after
20 months of captivity in the hands of pro-Iranian kidnappers in
Beirut, was flown to an undisclosed location to rest and enjoy a
reunion with his wife and two sons.
   Reporters were given no chance to talk to the 55-year-old
Frankfurt businessman upon his arrival at Cologne-Bonn airport
Tuesday night.
   West German officials, including Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, have denied making any payments for Cordes' freedom. He
was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers late
Monday night.
   But the mass-circulation Bild newspaper of Hamburg said ``a sum
of millions is believed to have been paid to kidnappers for the
release.'' Bild cited unidentified security sources.
   The newspaper also quoted a source identified only as a
``security expert'' as saying that at least 40 million marks ($22.2
million) were paid for Cordes' release. Bild is known to have good
sources within the government.
   A high-ranking government official described Cordes' long
captivity, the isolation he endured, and his constant uncertainty
over his fate.
   The Los Angeles Times said today Iran apparently arranged for
Cordes to be transferred from captors linked to Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, who is being tried in Germany for hijacking a TWA jet, to
the group that freed the West German.
   Iran apparently arranged the release to regain favor with West
Germany, a vital trading partner and the Western nation with which
it has the closest ties, the Times said, citing unidentified
sources.
   Cordes was abducted in West Beirut in January 1987, three days
before a West German engineer, Alfred Schmidt, was kidnapped.
Schmidt was freed Sept. 7, 1987. The Hamadi clan was believed to
have abducted both men.
   Cordes and his wife, Marlene, touched down at 10:20 p.m. aboard
a twin-engine West German military jet after a five-hour flight
from Syria.
   The federal minister for chancellery affairs, Wolfgang
Schaeuble, was aboard the same plane.
   Schaeuble later told West German television that Cordes was
``feeling better than he had expected.''
   ``But naturally he's very weak. He's probably feeling better now
because of the initial excitement than he will be tomorrow or the
day after tomorrow,'' the official said.
   ``He's been flown to a place where he can find privacy for a
time. He desperately needs quiet, to recover, to work through the
experience.
   ``I don't know where he's going and even if I knew I wouldn't
say,'' the official said.
   Schaeuble said Cordes told him his kidnappers ``treated him
humanely, but the conditions were hard, he was always isolated and
was always chained.''
   Hans Neusel, a state secretary in the federal Interior Ministry,
told reporters at the airport Cordes said there were signs he was
about to be released before it happened.
   ``His hopes increased when he was given new clothes three days
before he was freed,'' said Neusel, who also was on the plane with
Cordes.
   Schaeuble said Cordes could not identify the kidnappers because
they wore masks in his presence.
   The minister, who headed the government's Middle East crisis
staff, reiterated earlier government statements that no deals were
made for Cordes' release.
   Cordes, Beirut manager for the Hoechst AG pharmaceutical
company, was freed in Beirut at midnight Monday by Shiite Moslem
extremists. Syrian officers escorted him to Damascus after his
release.
   Cordes was the last West German hostage in Lebanon, where 17
other foreigners are still missing and believed held captive. The
longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Cordes' captors, a group calling itself the Holy Warriors for
Freedom, said in a statement Monday that they were freeing him in
response to Iranian and Syrian intervention.
   The kidnappers also said his release was linked to Hamadi, a
Lebanese Shiite on trial in West Germany for a 1985 TWA jetliner
hijacking and the shooting death of U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, is serving a 13-year prison
sentence in Frankfurt. He was convicted in April of complicity in
kidnapping Cordes and Schmidt in an effort to force West Germany to
free Mohammed Hamadi.

<TEXT>
   The city School Board president has been fired
for feeding false information to board members in an effort to
track down leaks to the news media.
   Mayor Kurt Schmoke on Tuesday removed Meldon S. Hollis Jr.,
saying Hollis' credibility had been undermined, but asked him to
remain a board member because he has ``good ideas.''
   Hollis was expected to announce today whether he would accept
the position. The board president said Tuesday he would resign if
the mayor asked.
   Schmoke called Hollis' actions ``a terrible mistake in
judgment.''
   ``My view is that the public can tolerate an official being
wrong on an issue,'' Schmoke said. ``What people generally find
intolerable is an official lying to them.''
   In tape-recorded remarks Monday to a political club, Hollis said
he leaked false information to board members ``to see if they were
lying to me.''
   ``I know who's doing the lying,'' he said. ``I know who it is. I
feed them the lies, then they run out and lie to the press.''
   ``Members of the school board ... tell you they are not
reporting things to the press and ... every time you say something
to 'em, it shows up in the press, only with a spin ... that's far
from accurate,'' he said. ``Then I think that you just do what you
have to do _ you tell them things just to see how it's reported in
the press. Then that way, you can tell who's reporting it to the
press.''
   Hollis said Tuesday he gave out three versions of how candidates
for school superintendent would be interviewed.
   ``I felt justified in taking extraordinary measures,'' he said.
Hollis said leaks were undermining the selection process, because
some candidates threatened to withdraw if their candidacies were
made public.
   Hollis said he had not deliberately misled any board members
``on anything substantial'' and that the story was ``essentially
true.''
   Board member Edward J. Gutman said, ``I think there's something
wrong with the man. The whole thing is getting uglier and uglier.
We are trustees (with) the most important responsibility in the
city.''
   Schmoke, who took office in December and declared that education
would be his first priority, named Hollis board president in his
first week. The mayor replaced Hollis with Joseph Lee Smith, 51, a
board member since 1979.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, who had
planned to bypass South Africa on his tour of the region, landed in
Johannesburg today after bad weather and mechanical trouble
diverted his flight to Lesotho.
   In Maseru, Lesotho, meanwhile, security forces surrounded a bus
filled with nuns and schoolgirls that was hijacked by armed
guerrillas as it headed for a Mass to be celebrated by John Paul.
   A nun today said some of the 71 captives had been released but
she did not know how many.
   Official Lesotho Radio said a group of ``fanatics'' had taken
over the bus Tuesday. Diplomats said the guerrillas were believed
to be members of the rebel Lesotho Liberation Army.
   The pope was informed of the hijacking, but made no comment.
   Arriving in Johnannesburg, the pope, an outspoken critic of
South Africa's racial segregation policies, did not kiss the
ground, as he customarily does the first time he visits a country.
   The pope, who is on a 10-day tour of southern Africa, spent
three hours at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport before he and his
entourage left for Lesotho in a convoy of cars and buses.
   The 270-mile trip to Lesotho, a mountain kingdom completely
surrounded by South Africa, was expected to take at least five
hours.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha greeted the pope on the steps
leading from the plane and accompanied him into a VIP lounge at the
airport while security forces stood guard inside and outside the
terminal.
   ``We consider it a privilege to assist the Holy Father,'' said
Botha, who ordered 100 luncheons for the entourage.
   The plane's pilot, Robin Cartwright, told reporters he decided
to divert the chartered Air Zimbabwe Boeing 707 flight because of a
low cloud ceiling and because two radio beacons at the airport in
Masera, Lesotho's capital, were out of order.
   In an announcement to passengers, the pilot said conditions had
been unsuitable to bring the plane below the clouds. Masera airport
is in a valley between 3,000-4,000-foot-high mountains.
   A hard, freezing rain fell on Lesotho. King Moshoeshoe II and
other officials waited at the airport for hours before the
announcement that the pope would come by road.
   Lesotho was to be the third stop on a 10-day trip that has taken
the pontiff to Zimbabwe and Botswana. He also plans stops in
Swaziland and Mozambique.
   The Vatican said South Africa's Catholic bishops have advised
John Paul that this was not an appropriate time for him to visit
South Africa.
   The pope has said he would like to visit South Africa at some
point, but the country was not mentioned when the Vatican announced
this week that John Paul would go to Tanzania and Madagascar on
another African tour next year.
   Hundreds of thousands of South Africans had been expected to
cross into Lesotho to see the pope during his scheduled 48-hour
visit to the kingdom.
   South Africa's Catholic bishops have been active in the
anti-apartheid movement, particularly in the period since 17 major
black opposition groups were banned in February.
   The government has blamed the bishops for the pope's decision to
omit South Africa from his official itinerary, and pro-government
media have claimed many Catholics are angry at their leaders.
   Pro-government media also tried to depict the pope as having
repudiated Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South Africa's
best-known anti-apartheid cleric.
   This interpretation was based on the pope's unqualified
denunication of political violence and reservations about sanctions
and election boycotts. Tutu advocates sanctions and is urging a
boycott of upcoming, segregated municipal elections.
   Tutu has repeatedly condemned violence but says he understands
how some South African blacks feel they have no other alternative
in seeking to end white-minority domination.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs, and its 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Tutu's spokesman, John Allen, said there are no fundamental
differences between the pope and the Anglican archbishop, who met
earlier this year at the Vatican.

<HEAD>Boston Police Join Trend to Semiautomatic Handguns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston police are switching to semiautomatic
handguns, joining other big city police departments trying to match
the firepower of drug dealers and other criminals.
   Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache announced Monday that 9mm
handguns will replace .38-caliber revolvers as standard-issue
weapons for the force.
   ``The bottom line is the average police officer is going to be
safer, and feel safer, because of these guns,'' said Robert T.
Guiney, president of the union that represents Boston's 1,400
patrol officers.
   The 9mm handgun fires more accurately, reloads more quickly and
carries more bullets, police said.
   Semiautomatic weapons were issued two years ago in Miami. Los
Angeles police will begin providing them in February, and they are
under review in Dallas and Chicago.
   Police in Washington, D.C., were armed this year with 9mm
semiautomatic weapons because of a murder rate double that of last
year. Detroit police and New York City's still use revolvers as
their primary weapons.
   ``We're being outgunned,'' Officer Harry Davis of the Los
Angeles police said Tuesday about the decision to use Beretta
semiautomatic guns next year. ``The criminals, the drug dealers
have more firepower than the police.''
   Boston's police department, the largest in New England with
1,900 members, joins the 1,200-member Massachusetts state police in
switching to the 9mm.
   The 650-member Metropolitan Police Department is making the
switch, and 50 smaller departments in Massachusetts already carry
the weapon.
   ``It's the wave,'' said Gary F. Egan, executive director of the
Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council. ``It's gradually
becoming as standard as the .38-caliber revolver once was.''
   The switch has been quicker among the nation's smaller police
and sheriff's departments, the majority of the nation's 19,000 law
enforcement agencies. Smaller departments can make the change more
quickly and cheaply.
   The average 9mm pistol costs about $400. The .38-caliber carries
only one shot in each of six chambers, which must be loaded
individually. Semiautomatic pistols are loaded by inserting a 12-to
17-round magazine into the handle.
   ``You're talking the difference of between 12 seconds to reload
a .38, under the best of conditions, and 2 seconds for a
9-millimeter,'' said Guiney.
   Boston officials said it could take more than a year to complete
the switch. The city must seek bids, select a manufacturer and
train officers to use the weapon.

<HEAD>Captain Does Not Provide Clue To Solve Crash Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE PEGO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of Delta Flight 1141 does not hold the
missing puzzle piece that could explain why the plane crashed, a
federal official says.
   Lee Dickinson Jr., a member the National Transportation Safety
Board, said Larry Davis ``does not know why this plane crashed.''
   Davis, one of 94 survivors from the Aug. 31 crash at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport that killed 14 people, was released
from Parkland Memorial on Tuesday after talking to NTSB
investigators about two hours.
   The captain was treated for back and facial injuries.
   Dickinson, who briefed the news media by telephone from
Washington on Tuesday, said that Davis seemed to have sharp
recollections of much of the flight but could not help explain why
the plane lost engine power and crashed.
   The captain told investigators that the flight from Jackson,
Miss., to Dallas had been uneventful and that everything seemed
normal again as he waited on the Dallas-Fort Worth taxiway to leave
for Salt Lake City.
   When the plane took off, everything seemed normal until it
climbed into the air, Davis told investigators. Davis heard ``two
loud bangs, or explosions'' but no warning beforehand.
   ``He previously experienced compressor stalls, but nothing like
this,'' Dickinson said.
   Davis, who is on medication but has been taken off morphine,
told investigators he went to full power and simply ``tried to keep
the airplane in the air.''
   One of the last things Davis recalled was that he had failed to
pull the plane out of trouble, Dickinson said. ``He realized they
were not going to make it,'' the investigator said.
   Investigators had hoped Davis might be able to tell them if the
plane's flaps had been set correctly, but he could only tell them
that he remembered they were approved when the crew went through
the preflight checklist, Dickinson said.
   ``We're still very concerned about the position of the flaps,''
Dickinson said.
   One inconsistency the NTSB had been trying to clear up has been
that the cockpit recording captured the crew saying the flaps were
in position for takeoff, but the wreckage showed the flaps in the
wrong position.
   ``He said he does not remember anything in relation to the flap
handle,'' Dickinson said.

   The man charged in the traffic accident
that killed ``Hill Street Blues'' actor Trinidad Silva Jr. has
pleaded guilty to drunken driving and vehicular manslaughter.
   Douglas Robert Owens, 35, was held on $25,000 bail for
sentencing Oct. 4. He pleaded guilty Tuesday, said Al Albergate,
spokesman for the district attorney's office.
   Owens apparently ran a stop light and collided with a pickup
truck driven by Silva on July 30, police said. Silva's wife Sofia,
28, and 2-year-old son were not seriously injured.
   Silva appeared as a gang member in the movie ``Colors,'' and as
the wiseacre gang leader Jesus Martinez on television's ``Hill

<HEAD>Hodel Promises Revised Policy By Next Fire Season</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing thruout</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said today the
government's ``let burn'' forest fire policy, proven inadequate in
the face of this summer's extraordinarily dry conditions, will be
revised before next year's fire season.
   To maintain now that the 16-year-old policy is sound ``just
doesn't make sense,'' he said in an interview on the NBC-TV
``Today'' show.
   ``I am confident that before the next fire season, we'll have a
revised policy in place which will take into account these kinds of
conditions,'' Hodel said.
   In a separate interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
Hodel said the ``let burn'' approach toward naturally occurring
forest fires did not work this season ``and to suggest that's a
sound policy just as it stands just doesn't make sense.''
   Hodel said that since July, when the policy was abandoned, the
Forest Service and the Park Service agreed to treat every blaze in
Yellowstone National Park as a wildfire, meaning it would be fought
with every resource possible.
   ``There isn't anybody today who wouldn't tell me they would have
fought every fire from the beginning of the season if they could
have foreseen what would happen this year,'' Hodel said..
   He said fires that have destroyed homes in California are coming
at the beginning of the fire season there. ``We're there where we
were in July or early August in Yellowstone,'' he said.
   President Reagan's spokesman said Tuesday that no time should be
wasted now arguing over the ``let burn'' policy and that the
government's attention will be focused on snuffing out blazes
raging in eight states.
   The comments came after Reagan was briefed at the White House on
the fires, which have charred some 4 million acres this summer.
   Reagan was told that there is no way to predict when the fires
will be put out, but that the administration has dedicated ``every
resource available'' to doing so, said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Asked about the harsh criticism that has erupted over the Park
Service policy of letting naturally occurring fires burn, Fitzwater
contended it was not the time for such a debate.
   He noted that the policy had been suspended in July and that any
new fires that erupt will be fought for the remainder of this
year's fire season.
   ``It doesn't serve anybody to get into discussions about policy
disputes,'' he said, adding, ``We're in the middle of a fire
situation of serious proportion and we're fighting it with
everything at hand.''
   Noting that the nation hasn't seen such fires in its history, he
did acknowledge that the situation calls ``for some review of the
policy.''
   ``At this point, what's clear is that the fires are out of
control. ... There is no need to argue over policy differences
until we come up with the next firefighting season next year. Right
now, it's all-out, fight-the-fires,'' he said.
   Fitzwater briefed reporters after Reagan met with Hodel,
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Deputy Defense Secretary
William H. Taft.
   Criticism of the government's ``let-burn'' approach to the fires
came from a usually strong Reagan administration supporter, Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who called the situation ``a catastrophe.''
   Hatch, speaking to reporters after visiting the White House,
said, ``We all knew how dry it was and a lot of us were saying,
`Hey, don't let this burn,' and they could have contained it at
that time.''
   Referring to the damage done to Yellowstone National Park, Hatch
said, ``Now you have a million acres lost in one of the most
important national park areas in the world. ... It's a
catastrophe.''

   President Reagan, on a political trip
for his vice president George Bush, declared today that the
national economy is strong and ``what we have seen in the last
eight years is only the beginning.''
   ``We intend to ensure this kind of economic prosperity right
through the '90s and into the next century by guaranteeing the
federal government can never again spend and tax the American
people into another economic nightmare,'' Reagan said.
   The president's remarks were prepared for delivery at a
Republican rally at Southeast Missouri State University in this
Mississippi River shipping center.
   He was to speak later in the day to an expected crowd of 1,000
at a $250-a-plate GOP fund-raising dinner in St. Louis.
   In his Cape Girardeau speech, Reagan said children born today
``will know the brightest future the world has ever seen.''
   ``That bright future is also yours,'' he told his audience. ``It
is your birthright as Americans, and what we have seen in the last
eight years is only the beginning.''
   The national economy has been expanding for more than five years
following the steep recession that marked Reagan's first two years
in office.
   ``Ultimately, the choice before the American people is the
choice between two visions,'' he said. ``It is the choice between
the policies of liberalism or the policies of America's political
mainstream.''
   The president, a former Democrat, said that party's ``liberal
leadership ... has turned a once proud party of hope and
affirmation into one dominated by strident liberalism and
negativism.''
   ``The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition's
memory lane, it starts to look like a `Nightmare on Elm Street.' If
you want to remember how things really were just a few years back,
think of the year 1979,'' he said.
   ``In that one year, Iran, Nicaragua and Grenada were all lost.
That was the year 1979. Don't we have the right to ask the American
people: If the liberals return to power, what happens in 1989?''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in advance of the trip that
Reagan would be giving ``traditional political speeches'' trying to
win support for the Republican ticket of Bush and Dan Quayle.
   The president plans one or two speaking forays each week until
the Nov. 8 election.
   GOP candidates hoping to benefit from the Missouri events
include Gov. John Ashcroft, seeking a second term against
Democratic State Rep. Betty Hearnes of Charleston, who is the wife
of former Gov. Warren Hearnes, and Sen. John Danforth, opposed by
State Sen. Jay Nixon of Hillsboro as he seeks his third term.
   Both Ashcroft and Danforth enjoy comfortable leads in state
public opinion polls.
   Bush, speaking Tuesday in Jefferson City, the state capital,
pledged, ``We will never go back to the grain-embargo days of those
Democrats, Carter and Mondale, and who knows who else.''
   Reagan took Missouri's 11 electoral votes with 51 percent of the
popular vote against then-President Carter in 1980 and swept the
state with 60 percent of the popular vote against Walter Mondale in
1984.
   Records showed that the only incumbent president to visit Cape
Girardeau previously was William Howard Taft on Oct. 26, 1902.
   In St. Louis, the state's most populous city with a metropolitan
area population of more than 2 million, the president was to speak
at an event for the Missouri GOP Victory '88 fund.

   Wisconsin Democrats dashed the comeback hopes of a former
governor by nominating a millionaire sports club owner to succeed
Sen. William Proxmire, while in Arizona, seven Republican
legislators who helped oust former Gov. Evan Mecham were defeated
by his supporters.
   Elsewhere in six state primaries Tuesday, two Republican
congressmen from New England passed the first hurdle toward higher
office.
   Vermont Rep. Jim Jeffords won the right to face Democrat William
Gray, a former U.S. attorney, for the seat of retiring GOP Sen.
Robert Stafford.
   New Hampshire Rep. Judd Gregg, son of a former governor,
captured his party's nomination to succeed Republican Gov. John
Sununu and will run against Democrat Paul McEachern.
   Minnesota voters, as expected, set up a November clash between
Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger, seeking a third term, and
Democratic Attorney General Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III.
   In the Arizona primary, the most prominent casualties were
Senate President Carl Kunasek, beaten by Mecham supporter Jerry
Gillespie, and House Speaker Joe Lane, a Republican who started the
impeachment process against Mecham last fall. He lost to Mecham
backers Lloyd Fenn and Warren Shumaker. Not all the former
governor's supporters were successful _ his press secretary, Ron
Bellus, was trounced by former Senate President Leo Corbet.
   The victor in Wisconsin's Democratic Senate primary was Herbert
Kohl, the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team owner who spent $2.1
million, mostly his own money, on a campaign built mainly on TV ads.
   Kohl, seeking office for the first time, said voters wanted ``a
qualified non-politician with real business-world experience and
they said they want a senator who'll be independent of special
interests.''
   But former Gov. Anthony S. Earl, who finished second in a
five-way race, said he hoped there could still be a place for
personal campaigning not so reliant on big money.
   ``I don't think Herb Kohl would mind if I say he got the most
votes but I got the best votes,'' said Earl, who lost the
governorship in 1986 after one term.
   Kohl will face state Sen. Susan Engeleiter, who defeated Stephen
B. King, a conservative former state GOP chairman. Engeleiter, in a
reference to Kohl's wealth, said there were ``major differences
between me and Herb Kohl. I am an average member of an average
Wisconsin family. I understand the concerns of the people out
there.''
   King had criticized Engeleiter for seeking the Senate when she
has two small children at home.
   That theme also was sounded in New Hampshire, when Sen. Gordon
Humphrey said former state Sen. Betty Tamposi should not seek the
GOP nomination for Congress because she has a 22-month-old
daughter. Humphrey apologized two days later, but the candidate he
backed, former state Supreme Court Justice Chuck Douglas, won a
six-way race.
   In New Hampshire's GOP gubernatorial primary, Gregg brushed
aside two opponents, then promptly attacked McEachern, vowing to
``show the people of New Hampshire what deep philosophical
differences there are ... a choice between fiscal restraint and
liberal spending.''
   In Vermont, Jeffords soundly defeated conservative Michael
Griffes after a primary in which his frequent opposition to
President Reagan's policies became an issue. Jeffords said Griffes'
supporters had ``overstated the case, to put it nicely'' in
attacking him on issues such as gun control and abortion.
   ``I'm hurt that people would feel so emotional about me that
they would want to try to destroy me,'' said Jeffords, whose
popularity among Democrats makes him a heavy favorite.
   Primaries also were held in:
   _ Utah, where Democrat Robert Stringham edged Craig Oliver for
the nomination to oppose Republican Rep. Howard Nielson.
   _ The District of Columbia, where all five City Council members
up for re-election gained their party's nomination. The council has
13 members.
   Here are vote totals in the major races:
   In Wisconsin, with 93 percent of the vote counted, Kohl had
244,085 votes or 47 percent, to Earl's 199,112 votes or 38 percent.
Former deputy attorney general Edward R. Garvey had 54,475 votes or
10 percent, Secretary of State Douglas La Follette had 20,221 votes
or 4 percent, and Edmond Hou-Seye, a tire dealer, had 5,139 votes,
1 percent.
   Engeleiter had 192,485 votes or 57 percent, to King's 136,110
votes or 40 percent. Peter Y. Taylor of Milwaukee had 8,638 votes
or 3 percent.
   In Vermont, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, Jeffords had
30,165 votes or 61 percent; Griffes had 19,163 votes or 39 percent.
   In New Hampshire, with 81 percent of precincts in, Gregg had
54,327 votes or 79 percent, former Manchester Mayor Robert Shaw had
12,389 votes or 18 percent and political neophyte William Lawrence
had 2,075 votes or 3 percent.

<HEAD>IRA Member Made Sudden Movement Before Being Shot, British Soldier
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British soldier said today that he shot an
IRA member because he thought the guerrilla was about to detonate a
car bomb.
   The soldier, one of four Special Air Services soldiers who shot
and killed three unarmed IRA members, testified during an inquest
into the shootings.
   He was identified only as `Soldier A' and was hidden from public
view by a curtain for security reasons.
   The soldier told the inquest he began shooting after ``a sudden
aggressive movement'' by Irish Republican Army member Daniel McCann.
   The British military said it believed the IRA man was about to
carry out a car bombing in this British colony.
   In an intense cross-examination, Patrick McGrory, the attorney
for the families of the three dead men, accused Soldier A of lying.
   ``I put it to you that it (the movement by McCann) didn't
happen. You shot him in the back without any movement whatsoever,''
McGrory said.
   ``There was movement. I'm not blind,'' the soldier responded.
   ``I thought he was going for a button, a switch to detonate the
bomb,'' he said. ``This was my major worry at this stage.''
   The testimony of Soldier A came on the seventh day of the
inquest by Gibraltar Coroner Felix Pizzarello and an 11-man jury
into the March 6 shooting deaths of Sean Savage, 24, Mairead
Farrell, 31, and McCann, 30, by soldiers of the elite
anti-terrorist unit.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
allege the shootings were evidence of an unofficial
``shoot-to-kill'' policy directed against IRA members on missions
against British targets.
   The IRA has acknowledged Savage, Farrell and McCann were members
on active service at the time of their deaths.
   A senior British intelligence officer has testified at the
inquest that the special services men believed the three were
planning to set off a car bomb during a changing of the guard
ceremony set for March 8.
   Neither a car parked in Gibraltar, nor another left on the other
side of the Spanish frontier contained a bomb.
   But Spanish police found a third IRA car loaded with 141 pounds
of Czech-made explosives and a timing device in the nearby resort
city of Marbella two days after the shooting.
   The inquest has no power of prosecution but is to determine
whether the SAS soldiers involved in the shootings acted lawfully.
If the inquest finds they did not, the soldiers could be criminally
charged.
   The seven men who formed the SAS unit that took part in the
operation against the IRA members have only been identified as
``soldiers A through G'' for fear they could become targets of
revenge attacks.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British out of Northern Ireland
and unite the province with the Irish Republic.

   Attorneys said they would appeal the conviction of
seven former or current police officers on charges of taking bribes
from bar and restaurant owners to overlook violations and perform
special services.
   ``I think this is a pretty sad day when the Justice Department
can be proud of this kind of prosecution,'' defense attorney Paul
Markham said after the verdict Tuesday, which came on the federal
jury's sixth day of deliberations.
   The defendants were convicted of 55 counts, including
racketeering and extortion. They were accused of accepting more
than $18,000 in bribes.
   ``We take no joy in these verdicts today, but I believe that
they will help to strengthen this department in the long term,''
Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache said.
   Judge A. David Mazzone set sentencing for Oct. 11. The officers
were convicted of two counts of racketeering, each carrying up to
20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. They also were convicted of
extortion, which carries the same penalty.
   ``I just think it's a sad commentary on the jury system and the
judicial system,'' said Anthony Traini, who represented Kilroe.
   Much of the prosecution's case rested on tape recordings made by
a nightclub manager in which officers discussed payoffs.
   During closing arguments, Special Prosecutor James B. Farmer of
the New England Organized Crime Strike Force said the case was
``about misuse of office for personal gain. It's about each one of
them using their power as Boston police officers to line their own
pockets.''
   Defense attorneys argued that the money accepted from business
owners was nothing more than Christmas and vacation gifts from
people with whom the officers worked closely over several years.
   The four former officers on trial were Thomas J. Connolly,
Francis X. Sheehan, John E. Carey and Peter Boylan. The three
current officers were John F. McCormick, Kenneth J. Nave and
Matthew A. Kilroe.

<HEAD>Reputed Drug Lord Convicted of Escape</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The attorney for a reputed South American
drug lord says he will appeal the man's escape conviction on
grounds he was illegally captured in Honduras, where his arrest
April 5 touched off anti-American riots.
   A federal jury Tuesday convicted Juan Ramon Matta, 43, of
escaping in 1971 from the Federal Prison Camp at Eglin Air Force
Base in the Florida Panhandle. Matta could receive up to five years
in prison at sentencing Oct. 27.
   Defense attorney Martin Stolar said he will challenge the
legality of Matta's arrest at his home in Tegucigalpa, the capital
of Honduras.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson ruled earlier that Matta was
wanted for possible involvement in international drug smuggling and
that previous court cases allowed the government to seize people
outside the United States.
   Matta was wanted for questioning in the 1985 slaying of U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Enrique Camarena Salazar in
Mexico.
   No charges have been filed against Matta in that case. But he is
under indictment in three California narcotics cases and one in
Arizona.
   Matta was serving a three-year sentence at Eglin for illegally
entering the United States, fraud and misuse of a visa. He was
accused of slipping out the back door of a chapel at the unfenced,
minimum-security prison during church services.
   Honduran police captured him in a raid by helicopter. Police and
American officials put him on a flight to the Dominican Republic,
and he was flown from there to New York.
   Matta had been living openly in Tegucigalpa since 1986, when he
escaped from a Colombian prison. He had been held on charges
involving the Medellin cartel responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine brought into the United States.
   His return to the United States touched off rioting in
Tegucigalpa by students, leftists and others that killed several
protesters and ended in the burning of the U.S. consulate.
Demonstrators contended Matta's extradition was barred by the
Honduran constitution.
   Extra security officers were posted for the trial here.

<HEAD>FBI Director Disciplines 6 in CISPES Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions said today he is
suspending three bureau employees and censuring three others for
mishandling a terrorism investigation into political opponents of
the Reagan administration's Central American policy.
   ``I am disciplining these individuals ... because of the
managerial or supervisory inadequacies displayed by them'' during a
bureau investigation of the Committee in Solidarity with the People
of El Salvador, Sessions told a congressional committee.
   ``The mistakes in judgment that took place during the CISPES
investigation were serious ones, and I cannot emphasize too
strongly my firm conviction that there is no place for such
mistakes in the work of the FBI,'' Session told the Senate
Intelligence Committee.
   Sessions became director of the FBI in November. He disciplined
the agents for actions taken from March 1983 to June 1985, when
William Webster was the FBI's boss. Webster now heads the CIA.
   Sessions said the six employees work variously at the
supervisory, unit chief and section chief levels and that they
include personnel from FBI headquarters in Washington as well as at
FBI field offices.
   Three of the employees, whom he did not name, have been placed
on probation and suspended without pay for 14 days. The other three
were formally censured, he said, with reprimands being placed in
the employees' files that could affect their chances for promotions.
   The director said a seventh employee, ``whose performance would
in all likelihood would have have merited dismissal,'' has
resigned. That was an apparent reference to an agent who quit in
1984 after acknowleding he had given classified documents to an
informant in the CISPES case.
   Sessions testified that the investigation was launched in March
1983, based largely on information provided by informer Frank
Varelli. The probe concentrated on the organization's headquarters
in Washington, its Dallas chapter and on a handful of other CISPES
chapters.
   The investigation was prompted by tips that key members of
CISPES were involved in covertly furnishing funds and material to a
leftist group seeking to seize power in El Salvador.
   Varelli told the bureau in 1984 that CISPES members were
plotting to assassinate President Reagan and disrupt the Republican
National Convention in Dallas.
   FBI officials now say Varelli supplied them with disinformation
and misinformation. He stopped working for the bureau in 1984 and
filed suit in 1986 to get some back pay he felt he was owed.
   ``The major problem came when the scope of the investigation was
unnecessarily broadened in October 1983,'' Sessions testified.
   ``The broadening of the investigation ... in essence directed
all field offices to regard each CISPES chapter, wherever located,
as a proper subject of the investigation.''
   Sessions said that, based on the available documentation,
``there was no reason to believe that all CISPES members nationwide
knew of or had any involvement in support of El Salvadoran or U.S.
terrorists. Thus, there was no reason to expand the investigation
so widely.''
   The FBI director said the decision to broaden the probe
unnecessarily ``was made at a comparatively low level and ...
supervisory personnel at FBI headquarters who should have reviewed
and analyzed this decision and appreciated its significance failed
to do so.''
   Sessions said there is no evidence that the White House or any
other government agency or outside private group attempted to
influence the CISPES probe. He said there is no evidence the probe
was politically motivated or director or that the conduct by the
six FBI employees who are being disciplined was illegal or
motivated by any improper purpose.
   The CISPES probe involved surveillance, undercover attendance at
meetings, interviews with organization members and checks of
telephone and utility company records and records of license and
credit bureaus, as well as law enforcement agency record checks.
   The probe was closed when the Justice Department concluded the
group was involved in political activities protected by the First
Amendment and not involved in terrorism.
   Details of the CISPES probe became public in February when a New
York lawyers' group obtained documents showing that FBI agents
photographed protesters at peace rallies, recorded license plate
numbers and investigated nuns, union members and college students.

   Palestinians stabbed to death an Arab suspected
of collaborating with the Israelis and dumped his pajama-clad body
on a West Bank street today, police and Arab reports said.
   The death of Adli Thalga, 30, in Nablus, raised to five the
number of alleged collaborators killed in the past 10 days after a
call from Palestinian leaders to ``rid ourselves of collaborators.''
   Also today, eight Palestinians were wounded in the occupied
territories, including a 12-year-old boy shot with a plastic bullet
in Nablus after Israeli troops arrived to close the market area
where Thalga's body was found, the army said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, Israeli troops
opened fire on a group of young Palestinians who were throwing
stones in the marketplace, wounding seven of them, the army said.
   The army lifted a curfew from the town of Qalqiliya in the West
Bank after maintaining it for eight consecutive days in the largest
manhunt for Palestinian activists in the uprising.
   The army said about 200 suspected activists were arrested during
the curfew. Telephone lines were cut and residents reported
frequent blackouts and water shortages, Israeli radio said.
   Curfews were in effect today in five West Bank refugee camps and
villages, forcing some 36,000 people to stay indoors.
   Israel radio said masked Palestinian assailants dragged Thalga
out of his house at dawn today and fatally stabbed him. Arabs
living in Nablus said he was a suspected collaborator.
   Seven Palestinians accused of cooperating with Israel have been
killed since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian rebellion in the
Israeli-occupied territories. The uprising has claimed the lives of
265 Palestinians and six Israelis.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today he feared an erosion in
Europe's attitude toward Israel following the European Parliament's
decision to allow PLO leader Yasser Arafat to address the group
Tuesday.
   ``We can't leave the stage open only to PLO propaganda,'' Peres
told reporters at the Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel
Aviv before leaving on a two-day visit to Britain.
   A meeting between Israeli peace crusader Abie Nathan and Arafat
prompted a political storm, with right-wing legislators demanding
Nathan be tried for treason for meeting with an enemy.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said an investigation would be
launched into Nathan's meeting with Arafat in Tunis and called it
``a grave deed and a serious transgression,'' Israel radio reported.
   Nathan, who founded the Voice of Peace radio station in 1973,
presented Arafat with a peace plan calling for mutual recognition
between Israel and the PLO and an end to the Palestinian uprising.

   A homeowner who put up a basketball
hoop in his driveway says he won't have to tear it down for now,
because the city has called a time-out on its ban on backboards.
   Bruce Meckler, 33, an attorney, threatened to sue after being
cited for a hoop, backboard and pole in his driveway. He contended
that at least 300 other residences in the city of 30,000 have
front-yard hoops, yet the city has not called foul against them.
   Meckler said City Council on Tuesday night agreed to a
moratorium on enforcement of the ordinance and may repeal it.
   ``We hit a couple of nice jumpers tonight,'' he said. ``If the
city does what I think they ought to do and repeal the ordinance,
it would be a terrific slam dunk.''
   This prosperous suburb north of Chicago is the home of
basketball superstar Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls. He lives
about a mile from Meckler.
   ``I think he plans to put a hoop in his house,'' Meckler said.
   Ann Sabol, city buildings coordinator, conceded there are
numerous hoops in Highland Park but said the city calls fouls only
when a neighbor complains.
   Ms. Sabol said, though, that Meckler can fight back with a new
full-court defense known as ``request for a zoning variance.''

   The Soviet Union today conducted
its first nuclear test explosion to be monitored by U.S. experts.
The blast at a long-secret testing ground shook the earth's surface
and shattered a window.
   The explosion in Soviet Kazakhstan had a force of 100-150
kilotons, the official news agency Tass said, several times more
powerful than the bomb that devastated Hiroshima, Japan, at the end
of World War II.
   The Hagfors Observatory of the Swedish Defense Research
Establishment said it measured the explosion at 50 to 150 kilotons.
   Buried in a hole more than 2,000 feet deep, the nuclear
explosion was felt and heard 2.4 miles away at the forward command
post.
   The ground shook and a low rumble was heard as a reddish cloud
of dust rose above the test site and the earth's surface bucked.
   The blast was not expected to have a noticeable impact at the
observation site about 30 miles from the blast but it shattered a
window in one building.
   ``The radiation situation in the region of the test and beyond
the boundaries of the test site is normal,'' Tass reported after
the blast at 8 a.m. The sparsely populated region is 1,700 miles
east of Moscow.
   Sophisticated American sensors planted just over 10 yards from
the device itself and five seismic sensors each in the United
States and Soviet Union were designed to gauge the force of the
blast.
   The verification techniques were expected to lead the U.S.
Senate to ratify two long-pending treaties limiting the size of
underground blasts.
   ``The goal of the experiment is to bring into practice the most
effective means of control, in order to use them for verifying the
1974 agreement on limiting underground tests of nuclear weapons and
the 1976 agr eement on underground nuclear explosions for peaceful
purposes,'' the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said.
   ``However, they did not go into effect because the American side
considers the measures of control insufficient,'' it said.
   The Joint Verification Experiment, which included a similar
blast at a U.S. testing range at Pahute Mesa, Nevada, a month ago,
marks a turning point in the two superpowers' nuclear test policies.
   The top-secret experiments always have been off limits to
scientists from the other side, who were forced to rely on data
gathered at great distance to determine the force of underground
explosions.
   Both sides accused the other of exceeding agreed-upon limits,
and the United States balked at ratifying the two treaties from the
1970s until it could monitor explosions close up.
   The Soviets, who have been campaigning for an end to all nuclear
testing, agreed earlier this year to go along with on-site
measurement.
   An American team of up to 40 specialists has been working at the
test site since April to drill a hole parallel to the Soviet test
hole and plant the Cortex hydrodynamic measuring device that the
U.S. government regards as the most sensitive gauge of a nuclear
explosion.
   Giant U.S. Air Force C-5A cargo planes ferried drilling rigs and
monitoring equipment into the sleepy Semipalatinsk airport to
prepare for today's test.
   ``No one thought even a year ago that what is about to happen,
could happen,'' said U.S. team chief C. Paul Robinson told
reporters Monday on his arrival to observe the test.
   He called the experiment ``a real triumph of
confidence-building'' for both sides.

   An IRS agent says he found no legitimate
business purpose for a personal 300-foot water slide, two
Rolls-Royces and hundreds of thousands of dollars that Jim and
Tammy Bakker and a key aide got through PTL.
   Larry Howlett, an auditor of tax-exempt organizations, was the
second witness Tuesday in the trial of the ministry's $52 million
claim against the Bakkers and former PTL aide David Taggart. The
trial began Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Under cross-examination today, Howlett conceded that because of
a lack of documentation, he could only assume that a business
purpose was lacking and that the expenditures were for personal use.
   PTL attorneys are seeking to force the Bakkers and Taggart to
repay the money they say was lost through through mismanagement of
funds that included cash advances on PTL credit cards and
unjustified compensation and benefits.
   Howlett listed among the expenditures with no legitimate
business purpose a 300-foot water slide at Bakker's Lake Wylie
home, which has since been sold, and $32,000 worth of luggage.
   Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis asked Howlett today whether the
Rolls-Royces and two Mercedes were solely for the personal use of
the Bakkers.
   ``PTL's check paid for them, but the paperwork was inconclusive
as to who the owner was,'' Howlett said. ``There's no documentation
that Bakker used the cars.''
   On Tuesday, Howlett testified that the IRS could find no
documentation to support the business purpose of about $300,000 in
cash advances made to Bakker and Taggart between 1984 and 1986.
   ``There was no back-up documentation for any of the cash
advances, none of them,'' Howlett said. ``We tried to evaluate the
business nature of these items, but we could not determine any.''
   Howlett also testified that records show neither Bakker nor
Taggart attempted to reimburse the ministry for money taken from
three executive accounts.
   The PTL television ministry and Heritage USA theme park at Fort
Mill filed for reorganization in bankruptcy court in June 1987,
three months after Bakker left the ministry amid a sex and money
scandal involving church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Earlier Tuesday, a former PTL accountant said he was frustrated
that Bakker and other top ministry executives continually ignored
his memos warning that the ministry financially was facing ``real
emergencies.''
   Peter Bailey, who was an accountant and financial director at
PTL from June 1979 through July 1987, also testified that top
executives received bonuses in anticipation of money coming into
the ministry's coffers, but that there was often no money in the
bank to cover those bonuses.
   Hovis said Tuesday that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds is
expected to adjourn the trial after this week's testimony. ``We'll
probably present our case in a month or so,'' Hovis said during a
break in the hearing.
   The Bakkers and Taggart stayed away from the hearing again
today, just as they have skipped preceding sessions. Hovis has said
he will call them as witnesses.

   Harvard, in a reversal, plans to set up
companies to help the university make money off professors'
discoveries.
   Eight years ago, Harvard decided against commercial involvement,
saying it could compromise the university's commitment to knowledge.
   Harvard is trying to get corporations to invest up to $35
million that would be used to organize companies around the work of
researchers, mostly those at Harvard Medical School, The Boston
Globe said today.
   If the companies were successful, they would be sold, and
Harvard would get 10 percent of the profits.
   Some academics fear that the profit motive can distort what they
see as their main role _ the search for knowledge _ by introducing
subtle pressures on researchers to spend their time on projects
with commercial potential.
   Harvard President Derek Bok and other university officials said
the plan addresses concerns about mixing business and learning.
``There are few things that matter to me more than trying to strike
this balance,'' he told the Globe.
   The plan's complicated financial arrangement is designed to
allow the university to profit from the work of faculty members
without getting directly involved in commercialization, the
university said.
   Researchers who make potentially profitable discoveries would
not be required to sign up with Harvard's commercial arm if they
preferred to make their own arrangements with private investors.
   In 1980, the university planned to join Harvard biochemist Mark
F. Ptashne in forming a genetic engineering company. Harvard helped
organize the company and find initial investors in return for 15
percent of the company's stock.
   But Bok pulled Harvard out of the arrangement. He said directly
investing in commercializing researchers' work ``could confuse the
university's central commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and
learning.''
   Medical School Dean Daniel C. Tosteson said Tuesday that he was
trying to find a way to augment the school's $350 million research
budget, speed development of useful research and more directly
profit from arrangements that professors were making on their own
with private investors.

<HEAD>Israeli Officials: Arafat's Jewish New Year Wish a `Stunt'</HEAD>

   Israeli officials said today that PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's greeting to Israel on the occasion of the Jewish
New Year was nothing but a stunt and should not be taken seriously.
   Arafat extended wishes for a peaceful new year in the Middle
East at a news conference in Strasbourg, France, where he addressed
socialist members of the European Parliament a day earlier.
   ``To all Israelis and to all Jews, `Shana Tova,' `Shana Tova'''
Arafat said, using the Hebrew expression for ``Happy New Year.''
   ``When I say `Shana Tova,' I mean ... a peaceful new year for
all our children, all our peoples, for the whole of the Middle
East,'' Arafat said, speaking in Arabic with Israeli peace activist
Abie Nathan.
   Arafat also said he was willing to meet with Israeli government
respresentatives at the United Nations.
   Nathan met with Arafat in Tunis this week. He could be
prosecuted when he returns for holding such a meeting, which
violates a 1986 Israeli law banning contacts with terrorist groups.
   Israeli officials dismissed Arafat's greeting as a public
relations ploy. But pro-PLO Palestinians said it showed Arafat
favored a political solution and was seeking peace.
   ``Really it's a stunt,'' a foreign ministry official said.
   ``It's very nice to say `Shana Tova' in front of a group of
journalists, but it would be more constructive if in his speech
yesterday there were some concrete change in policy,'' the official
said on condition of anonymity.
   Addressing Parliament members Tuesday, Arafat repeated his call
for the creation of an independent Palestinian state in the
occupied territories.
   He also reiterated the PLO's insistence that Israel recognize
Palestinian rights to self-determination.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Arafat's
gesture would not change the right-wing Likud Party's opposition to
holding talks with the PLO. ``We will not be misled by the lip
service of Mr. Arafat and seeming gestures like wishing `Shana
Tova' to our people,'' the spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir said.
   ``We know him very well and we continue in our policy to seek
peace but not to have contacts with Mr. Arafat and his
organization,'' he said. ``With God's help we shall overcome all
our enemies.''
   Israeli leftist Uri Avnery, who has met with Arafat 10 times
since 1982, said the Hebrew greeting showed Arafat sincerely sought
negotiations with Israel.
   ``It is obvious that Arafat is ready to talk to Israelis. Now he
is speaking in a friendly tone towards Israelis and Jews,'' Avnery
said in an interview.
   ``They say new sounds make new music, so now there ... are new
sounds (of Hebrew) in the PLO,'' said Avnery, who first met Arafat
in Beirut during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
   Jack Khazmo, the pro-PLO publisher of the Palestinian weekly
Al-Bayader Assiyasi said Arafat's gesture showed he was abandoning
aggression in favor of a political solution in the occupied
territories.
   ``This means the PLO is putting aside the military option. It
means the PLO is willing to knock on the door of peace,'' Khazmo
said.
   As sign of how little credence Israeli officials placed on the
greeting, one government spokesman said: ``You can tell Arafat that
this Israeli official jokingly returns his wishes for peace in the
Middle East.''

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen said today that he and Michael Dukakis were for a
strong defense based on practical weapons and not the ``Buck
Rogers'' dreams of the Reagan admnistration.
   The Texas senator, stumping in his home state where polls show
the Democrats slightly behind, said both he and Dukakis know ``the
first duty of any president is to defend the United States against
all enemies.''
   In a speech at the site of a collection of World War II
airplanes, Bentsen said the Democrats supported the Stealth and B-1
bombers, the cruise missile and other new weapons, including
research and development of strategic defenses.
   ``But ... we are living in the real world _ not some science
fiction movie,'' he said. ``And in the real world, real wars are
still fought with real tanks and guns and fighter planes.''
   ``Under this administration, Buck Rogers has been promoted and
our conventional forces have been neglected,'' allowing the Soviets
to gain in those areas, he said.
   Bentsen spoke in Harlingen where he toured a collection of World
War II military aircraft. He donned a leather flight jacket,
climbed aboard one of the planes and the engine was started up.
   However, he didn't fly any of them. The former B-24 bomber pilot
says he stopped flying after he joined the Senate in 1970. Besides,
the collection does not include any B-24s.
   Bentsen planned to travel this afternoon to an LTV Corp. defense
plant near Dallas for another speech.
   Bentsen's appearances on the defense issue were part of an
overall focus on the topic this week by the Dukakis-Bentsen
campaign. Especially in the South, Dukakis is seen as needing to
convince voters he would have a strong defense policy.
   Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee, has been
painting Dukakis as a liberal whose opposition to many new weapons
systems, such as the MX and Midgetman missiles, would amount to
unilateral disarmament of the U.S. military.

South through Saturday before returning to Washington.
   The campaign schedule included stops in Shreveport, La., and
Memphis, Tenn., on Thursday and in North Carolina and Florida on
Friday and Saturday. The campaign was monitoring the progress of
Hurricane Gilbert in case the storm could threaten any of those
appearances.

   A horse breeder has pleaded innocent
to charges he sold two foals that he claimed were offspring of a
mare who was in fact infertile.
   Celestino DiLibero of Citra was accused in a fraud indictment of
scheming with racing officials to list the foals in the official
thoroughbred registry as offspring of Rare Personality, whose
father won the Preakness in 1971.
   The foals sold for more than $200,000.
   DiLibero entered his innocent plea Tuesday. The others charged
in the indictment, Alfredo Garcia and Ernesto Perez, former
employees of the New York City-based Jockey Club, failed to appear
and warrants were issued for their arrest.
   The three each face up to 20 years in prison and $13,000 in
fines if convicted.
   Ocala horse breeder Jack Winterbotham, who owned Rare
Personality before she was sold to DiLibero, tipped authorities off
to the scheme, said Kathleen O'Malley, an assistant U.S. attorney.
   Winterbotham, who said he sold the mare because she was
infertile, attended an auction in Lexington, Ky., in 1983 and was
surprised to see two foals, supposedly from Rare Personality, on
the auction block. They sold for $140,000 and $75,000.
   Although the parents of Rare Personality were well-known race
horses, the mare born in 1973 never raced. She was the offspring of
the 1971 Preakness winner, Personality, and the mare Rare Treat, a
16-time first-place winner.

   A Swedish researcher who has implanted
human fetal tissue into the brains of two patients with Parkinson's
disease told a National Institutes of Health committee today it
would be unethical not to use such experimental treatment.
   Dr. Lars Olson, professor of neurobiology at Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm, was among experts asked to appear before
the NIH panel considering what U.S. government policy should be on
such research which the White House proposes to ban.
   One of the questions the 21-member panel of outside experts was
asked to consider was whether animal studies have progressed enough
to warrant using the procedure on humans.
   ``The animal data ... are so promising we have approached a
point where I believe it is unethical not to do this in human
studies,'' replied Olsen.
   He said his human studies involve two patients who received
fetal brain cell transplants eight months ago after suffering from
the disease for 15 years and not responding to other treatment.
   He described both as extreme cases, severely handicappped and
out of control.
   He made no dramatic claims, but said: ``There have been no
adverse effects. It appears that we are seeing minor positive
changes in the patients.''
   He said the transplanted cells have not had time to fully mature
and expressed optimism that the patients, both women in their 50s,
will continue to improve.
   The panel was concentrating on scientific issues today and will
turn to moral and ethical considerations Thursday before drafting
its recommendations on Friday.
   A proposed executive order from the White House _ not intended
for public disclosure _ would prohibit experimentation with fetal
tissue.
   Some members of the advisory panel, which includes doctors,
researchers, lawyers and medical ethicists, were offended that the
White House had proposed a position on the issue before the
committee had a chance to meet.
   NIH Director James B. Wyngaarden appointed the committee on the
instructions of Dr. Robert E. Windom, the assistant HHS secretary
for health.
   The issue surfaced last April when NIH sought clearance for
experiments in which brain cells from a fetus would be transplanted
into patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.
   Windom denied permission, saying new questions raised by such
research warranted careful review.
   Researchers are hopeful the new techniques will prove useful in
treating Parkinson's and a variety of other diseases such as
Alzheimer's and juvenile diabetes.
   However, the treatment involves use of fresh brain cells,
virtually requiring that they be obtained from planned, induced
abortions rather than natural miscarriages.
   The moral and ethical questions raised are illustrated by an
expressed desire by some women to become pregnant so they can
produce an aborted fetus to use in treating relatives.
   Ethicists also have expressed concern that any guidelines for
such procedures would have to deal with the possibility that
researchers would pay for abortions in order to obtain tissue.
   Gary L. Bauer, President Reagan's assistant for policy
development, sent Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen
a draft executive order accompanied by a memo saying he wanted to
rush the proposed federal ban into effect as soon as possible.
   However, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday that
the proposed executive order did not represent official White House
policy and was merely an early draft to get discussion started.
   ``It shall be the policy of the federal government, to the
extent permitted by law, that an unborn or newborn child who has
died as a result of an induced abortion shall not be used for
purposes of research or transplantation,'' said the draft
circulated by Bauer.
   Surgeons in Mexico City reported last January that they had
injected fresh fetal tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains
of two Parkinson's suffers with promising results.

   About 40,000 enthusiastic rock fans
braved heavy rains to cheer Bruce Springsteen and other top stars
as they appealed for human rights in a seven-hour concert.
   Thousands of umbrellas swayed to the music in San Jose's
National Stadium in the first Latin American stop on the ``Human
Rights, Now!'' tour organized by the London-based Amnesty
International.
   ``I ask you to join me and my friends to fight for the respect
of human rights around the world,'' Springsteen, using a
Spanish-language interpreter, said in the middle of his set.
   ``Si!,'' the crowd bellowed in response.
   Also performing were Sting, Tracy Chapman and Youssou N'Dour.
   Authorities reported no major disturbances during the marathon
concert. The Red Cross said it treated two women for slight
injuries, and a raucous group that did not attend the show stoned
an ambulance outside the stadium.
   About 300 Panamanian concert-goers arrived in chartered buses
for the show and chanted briefly against Panama's de facto ruler,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who commands that country's army.
   Barry Roberts, chief organizer of the San Jose concert, said 150
private detectives were hired to monitor the crowd.
   The tour began Sept. 2 at London's Wembley stadium and later

   Police officers not afraid of getting their

down the toilet.
   ``One more flush and the heroin would have been gone,'' said
Capt. E.E. Sarvis of the police Organized Crime Division.
   Vice officers went after the drugs after drug raid at a house
early Tuesday.
   ``They apparently saw us coming and flushed it down the
toilet,'' Sarvis said. ``We dug up the sewer line. We knocked a
hole in it and right there we found a bundle with 20 bags of heroin
in it.''
   A second bundle of 20 bags was found farther down the line in
the backyard of the house, Sarvis said.
   Phillip Anthony Jones, 37, and Ernest Moore, 40, were charged
with drug offenses and released on $10,000 and $3,000 bail
respectively, police said.

   Firefighters battling Western blazes got a helping hand from
weather so cool and wet that a crew was pulled out of the
wilderness near Yellowstone National Park for fear they'd be
trapped by snow.
   ``Things are real calm,'' said park spokesman Greg Kroll.
``We've had some pretty good precipitation.''
   Meanwhile, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said today the
government's ``let it burn'' forest fire policy will be revised
before next year's fire season.
   To maintain now that the 16-year-old policy is sound ``just
doesn't make sense,'' he said in an interview on NBC's ``Today''
show.
   ``I am confident that before the next fire season, we'll have a
revised policy in place which will take into account these kinds of
conditions,'' Hodel said.
   Fires burned in California, Utah, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Alaska
and Washington state as the worst fire season in 30 years continued.
   Calmer 5-7 mph winds, lower temperatures and higher humidity
were a blessing to California's Gold Rush country, where a fire has
burned 52 square miles since Sunday and destroyed 97 homes and 60
other buildings. Firefighters had surrounded 90 percent of the
blaze today.
   The thousands of residents evacuated Sunday or Monday were
allowed to return to their homes.
   ``Very little happened last night. The fire really laid down. It
was even hard to find embers in some regions,'' overnight fire
operations chief Bill Holmes said today.
   About 30,000 firefighters battled 32 fires in eight Western
states, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. President
Reagan received a briefing Tuesday from a Cabinet-level team that
toured Yellowstone.
   As of Tuesday, wildfires had charred 4.1 million acres, an area
larger than Connecticut, according to the Boise Interagency Fire
Center, which coordinates firefighting in the West.
   Hodel said today that officials have enough resources. ``What we
need now is some continued help from the weather,'' he said.
   ``If we continue to get the weather break, they're actually on
the fire line right now directly fighting the fire, which is
something they weren't able to do as long as it was so hot, dry and
windy,'' Hodel said.
   At Yellowstone, clouds that have covered the park since Saturday
began to lift today and temperatures reached only 40 degrees, but
officials expected a warming trend that would take temperatures to
the 70s, said park spokesman Steve Iobst.
   ``The fires are still a threat, we are not out of it yet,'' said
fire information officer Sonya Capek.
   Firefighters used the break to strengthen lines. Meanwhile,
about 550 Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., the first of 1,200
sent to reinforce the 7,200 firefighters in the park, arrived in
West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The weather was so cool officials began distributing
cold-weather gear donated by residents of Wyoming communities. Few
firefighters had been prepared for the cold and wet.
   Fires have blackened 939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park.
Blazes in national forests and parks surrounding Yellowstone in
Wyoming, Montana and Idaho bring the total to 1.4 million acres.
   In the Bridger-Teton National Forest southeast of the park, a
38,507-acre fire was declared contained and a 225,500-acre complex
of fires was 85 percent contained with full containment expected by
Thursday.
   North of the park, a 93,000-acre fire that threatened Cooke City
and Silver Gate was declared 90 percent contained with complete
containment expected by Saturday.
   A crew was pulled out of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north
of the park, said fire information officer Ted Coffman.
   ``We were afraid if we put a crew in there we might not be able
to get them out if it snowed,'' Coffman said.
   At Glacier National Park in Montana near the Canadian border,
more than 900 firefighters joined by a Canadian ``hot-shot'' crew
had a 31,500-acre blaze 30 percent contained. The fire has
destroyed 21 homes, killed one firefighter and injured six others.
   ``They're expecting hot temperatures up there (in Glacier)
today, up into the mid-80s,'' said fire information officer Les
Mahugh. ``They feel there will be increased fire activity because
of the higher temperatures.''
   Firefighters were to be joined today by 1,400 Army soldiers from
Fort Lewis, Wash.
   Elsewhere in Montana, 1,100 firefighters attacked a 247,000-acre
fire north of Helena, crews demobilized from a fire in the far
northwest part of the state and rehabilitation work began near
Cooke City and Silver Gate north of Yellowstone.
   Controversy has surrounded the Yellowstone fires because of the
Park Service policy of not fighting most naturally-caused blazes.
   Reagan said Tuesday that he had not been aware of the policy but
that Hodel told him it was being rescinded.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer said Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis would join him, Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan, Montana
Gov. Ted Schwinden and Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus on Thursday to
survey fire damage in Yellowstone and discuss policy.

   Radical students yelling anti-Olympic
slogans hurled firebombs today at runners carrying the Olympic
torch while riot police battled to disperse the protesters.
   Police said 16 policemen were injured in the fighting at
Kyungwon University on the southern outskirts of Seoul after
students hurled about 50 firebombs at the Olympic torch procession.
   Some of the bombs exploded about 10 yards from the runner
carrying the Olympic torch, eyewitnesses said. None of the runners
or other escorts of the Olympic flame was hit and the procession
did not halt as it passed by the school in a semi-rural area, the
witnesses said.
   Radical students staged peaceful anti-Olympic protests today at
several colleges in Seoul. Protesters burned the American flag and
shouted ``Yankee go home.''
   About 200 students took part in a ``Stop the Olympic Torch
Rally'' at Kyungwon to block the torch as it passed on the road in
front of the school. Faculty members tried unsuccessfully to stop
the protest.
   ``Oppose the dictatorial Olympics,'' students yelled.
   Riot police moved in to block the school's main gate to stop the
students from marching out onto the road. But students rushed to
the school wall and hurled firebombs at the torch procession,
eyewitnesses said.
   Police then stormed onto the campus and troopers and students
battled with their fists, police said. Many of the injured police
were hit by firebombs, they said.
   Police officials would not say if there had been any arrests or
if any students had been injured.
   The Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee said it was unaware of
any attack.
   The torch with the Olympic flame from Greece is due to arrive in
Seoul Saturday to open the Summer Olympic Games. It was being
carried to the western port of Inchon today when the attack took
place.
   Radical students have staged scattered demonstrations against
the Olympics during the past week and battled riot police in
clashes at some Seoul campuses. The demonstrations have been small
and have failed to attract public support.
   The great majority of South Koreans, including most students,
want the Games to be a success.
   The students are demanding the Olympics be shared with communist
North Korea to promote reunification of the divided Korean
peninsula. They also contend the Games are cementing authoritarian
rule in South Korea.
   ``The Olympics are making the rich people richer, the poor
people poorer,'' said a statement today by radical students.
   The Olympic flame is being carried across South Korea by more
than 1,000 torchbearers who each carry it for about half a mile
while being escorted by up to 12 other runners. Police and security
agents have been guarding the procession.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics because its
demand to co-host the Games was turned down. The International
Olympic Committee has said the Olympics are awarded only to a
single city.
   The two Koreas are bitter rivals and both claim to be the sole
legitimate government on the peninsula. South Korea fears the North
may try to disrupt the Olympics.
   The United States has about 42,000 troops based in the South
under a mutual defense treaty.

   Thousands returned to their homes
as fire officials, heartened by a day of favorable weather, lifted
evacuation orders and reopened all major highways where a fire
ravaged Gold Rush country.
   Calmer winds, lower temperatures and higher humidity Tuesday and
today helped crews as they bulldozed lines around more than 90
percent of the 3-day-old blaze, which gutted nearly 100 homes and
threatened as many as 5,000.
   ``The fire really laid down. It was even hard to find embers in
some regions,'' overnight fire operations chief Bill Holmes said
today.
   ``As far as I know, we have allowed everyone who wants to return
home to do so,'' state Department of Forestry spokesman Steve
Iverson said Tuesday.
   But some of the 8,000 residents evacuated had little or nothing
to return to in the charred foothills of the Sierra Nevada
northeast of Sacramento.
   Rusty Cline, 51, of the tiny community of Rough and Ready was
part of a stream of refugees at a high school evacuation center
Tuesday, which American Red Cross worker Elizabeth Quirk dubbed
``the morning of tears.''
   ``The fire raced in on us. We ran for the car, but it beat us
there,'' said Cline, weeping. ``I couldn't get my dog in the car.
She was too scared.'' Her dog's fate was unknown.
   Preliminary damage estimates were set at about $9 million, but
authorities expected the figure to climb.
   Officials also prepared today to begin relieving some of the
2,800 firefighters who have battled the fire, which consumed more
than 52 square miles of timber and brush or 33,500 acres since it
was started Sunday.
   ``If it holds through the night, we'll consider releasing some
people,'' said Iverson, the planning chief for the firefighting
force.
   Full containment of the fire was expected by Thursday night,
said Jack Placchi, a U.S. Forestry Service spokesman.
   The fire, which apparently was started by a transient burning a
piece of toilet paper, was one of several blackening Northern
California and the drought-parched West, including fires that have
charred nearly 1 million acres of Yellowstone National Park.
   The blaze had been whipped by 30-plus mph gusts through Monday.
But on Tuesday, winds were a moderate 5 to 7 mph while temperatures
were about 10 degrees lower and the humidity level nearly double,
Iverson said.
   ``The fire today cooperated quite a bit,'' he said.
   The one drawback to the weather was an air inversion that forced
the grounding of eight aerial tankers, which had dropped more than
2,000 tons of fire retardant on the blaze Sunday and Monday.
   The swift-moving blaze had threatened 4,000 to 5,000 structures,
but only 97 homes and 60 other buildings had burned.
   Iverson said no additional homes were threatened as of Tuesday
night. But homes in unburned pockets within fire lines could be
threatened if winds shifted or pick up, he added.
   ``There's no nice clear fire line. It's a checkerboard,'' he
said.
   Fire officials reopened state highways 20 between Grass Valley
and Marysville and 49 north of Nevada City. Some restrictions,
however, remained on secondary roads where mop-up operations
continued.
   Flames Tuesday also scorched grasslands in the deserted eastern
sector of Beale Air Force Base, home for some of the nation's most
sophisticated spy planes. But the fire was stopped more than four
miles from the edge of the main part of the base, firefighters said.
   ``It's all out. It's history. There are no problems there,''
said Bill Holmes, a state forestry spokesman.
   The drought, which increased the amount of tinder-dry grass and
bush, created a dangerous and unpredictable condition for
firefighters and residents along with the winds and low humidity.
   But no firefighter suffered a serious injury, Iverson said.
Seven had been treated at hospitals for minor burns and 500 had
checked into first aid stations with cuts, scrapes and sprains, he
said.
   There were no reports of injuries among those evacuated, Iverson
said.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen, seeking votes in his pro-defense home state of
Texas, said Wednesday that Michael Dukakis would pursue practical
weapons instead of the ``Buck Rogers'' Republican program.
   ``We live in the real world these days, not some science fiction
movie,'' said the former bomber pilot, speaking on a podium amid a
collection of World War II combat planes. ``And in the real world,
real wars are still fought with real tanks and guns and fighter
planes,'' he said.
   ``Under this administration, Buck Rogers has been promoted and
our conventional forces have been neglected'' while the Soviets
have gained in that area, he said.
   ``Mike Dukakis and I are going to devote more defense resources
to areas where America is most vulnerable,'' he said.
   Bentsen toured the Confederate Air Force, a private collection,
and spoke to an audience including uniformed students from the
nearby Marine Military Academy, a boarding high school.
   The Texas senator donned a leather flight jacket, climbed aboard
and fired up a single-engine trainer. He waved to the crowd and
cameras from the open cockpit as the wind from the prop blew back
his hair.
   Both Bentsen and Dukakis were hitting the military theme to
counter Republe sections,
said Gretchen Allen, former press secretary for the Cayman
government.
   ``There did not seem to be casualties and the island seem to

<TEXT>
   The Lebanese army today closed the only
crossing between Beirut's Christian and Moslem sectors after Shiite
Moslem militiamen took to the streets in west Beirut for the first
time in 17 months.
   The actions came a day after the country's Shiite-Moslem defense
minister was briefly held hostage by Christian militiamen forces,
heightening tensions between Christians and Moslems deadlocked over
the election of a new president.
   The political wrangling has raised fears that fighting will
renew Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.
   A statement said army commander Gen. Michel Aoun issued the
order to close the mid-city Museum crossing. Only travelers on
their way to or from the airport were exempt.
   A military source said the militiamen belonging to the Amal
organization, headed by Justice Minister Nabih Berri, took up
positions near the crossing and set up a traffic checkpoint.
   ``The command decided to close the crossing in light of Amal's
suspicious move to avoid jeopardizing the lives of civilians,''
said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said Amal's move could result in reciprocal deployment by
militias on the Christian side and lead to clashes.
   Amal's deployment in the Barbir district was the first by the
Syrian-backed militia in west Beirut since the Syrians moved in to
end three years of militia anarchy in February 1987.
   Christian militiamen held Defense Minister Adel Osseiran, a
Shiite, for three hours in east Beirut on Tuesday, police said. The
militiamen demanded the release of Farid Serhal, a Christian
parliamentarian, who they say is held in the Moslem sector for the
past week.
   But Osseiran was released after the army threatened to crack
down.
   Serhal was one of the Christian deputies who boycotted a
parliamentary session to elect a new president Aug. 18.
Syrian-backed candidate Suleiman Franjieh, who was president from
1970 to 1976, was the only serious runner and there were not enough
legislators for a quorum.
   Franjieh's followers have accused the right-wing Christian
Lebanese Forces militia, which is sympathetic to Israel, of
forcibly preventing deputies from attending the session to block
Franjieh's election.
   A statement attributed to Serhal said he was to meet the Sunni
Moslem acting Prime Minister, Salim Hoss, and hold a news
conference in west Beirut on Wednesday. He did not appear.
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, has set
Sept. 22 as a new date for the election, one day before the
six-year term of President Amin Gemayel expires.
   An unwritten national covenant dating to Lebanon's independence
from France in 1943 stipulates the president must be Maronite
Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the house speaker
a Shiite.

   Radical students hurled firebombs
Wednesday at runners carrying the Olympic torch, and police said 16
troopers fighting to disperse the protesters were injured.
   Students at Kyungwon University on the southern outskirts of
Seoul threw about 50 firebombs at the Olympic torch procession.
Some of the bombs exploded about 30 feet from the runner carrying
the Olympic torch, witnesses said.
   None of the runners or other escorts of the Olympic flame were
hit and the procession continued past the school, which is in a
semi-rural area, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Radical students staged peaceful anti-Olympic protests Wednesday
at several colleges in Seoul. Protesters burned effigies of figures
draped with the U.S. flag or anti-American slogans and shouted,
``Yankee go home!''
   ``Get out American imperialists,'' said a slogan on an effigy at
Korea University.
   About 200 students took part in the ``Stop Olympic Torch Rally''
at Kyungwon University and faculty tried unsuccessfully to stop the
protest.
   ``Oppose dictatorial Olympics!'' students yelled.
   The students are demanding the Olympics be shared with communist
North Korea to promote reunification of the Korean peninsula. They
also contend the Games are promoting authoritarian rule.
   Riot police moved in to block the main gate of the university to
stop the students from marching into the street. But the students
crowded near a school wall and hurled firebombs at the torch
procession, witnesses said.
   Police stormed onto the campus and troopers and students battled
each other with fists, police said. Many of the injured police were
hit by firebombs, they said.
   Police officials would not say if there had been any arrests or
if any students had been injured. The Seoul Olympic Organizing
Committee said it was unaware of any attack.
   The torch with the Olympic flame is being carried across South
Korea by more than 1,000 torchbearers who each carry it about half
a mile, escorted by up to 12 other runners. Police and security
agents guarded the procession.
   The Olympic flame is to arrive in Seoul Saturday to open the
Summer Olympic Games.
   Radical students have staged scattered demonstrations against
the Olympics during the past week and battled riot police at some
Seoul campuses. The demonstrations have been small, with no more
than a few hundred students taking part in each one.
   The radicals have failed to attract public support. The great
majority of Koreans, including most students, want the Games to be
a success.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics because its
demand to be a co-host for the Games was turned down. The
International Olympic Committee said the Olympics are awarded to a
single city.
   The two Koreas, which fought the 1950-1953 Korean War, both
claim to be the sole legitimate government of the peninsula. South
Korea fears the North may try to disrupt the Olympics.
   The United States has about 42,000 troops based in the south
under a mutual defense treaty.

   The death toll from the Ramstein air
show disaster rose to 62 when a 19-year-old West German man died,
West German state officials said Wednesday.
   On Aug. 28, an Italian air force stunt team jet fighter collided
with two other planes in the team and exploded in a crowd of
spectators at the U.S. Air Force base at Ramstein in southwestern
Germany.
   The young man died late Tuesday of serious burns in a Homburg
clinic, spokesman Juergen Dietzen of the Rhineland-Palatinate state
Interior Ministry said. He refused to release the man's name.
   Officials said 154 patients, about 25 of them in critical
condition, remain hospitalized in clinics throughout West Germany
with injuries from the air show crash, Dietzen said.
   The dead are 55 West Germans, a U.S. soldier and her 9-year-old
son, one French citizen, one Dutch citizen and the three Italian
pilots.

   Residents along the Gulf Coast today
stockpiled food and supplies and prepared for mass evacuations as
they braced for Hurricane Gilbert, deemed one of the most dangerous
in history.
   The hurricane, with 175 mph wind, ripped through Jamaica and the
Cayman Islands and took aim at the resort island of Cozumel,
Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico. At least 11 people have been killed
and an estimated 60,000 left homeless.
   Forecasters were reluctant to predict the destination of the
storm, called ``extremely dangerous'' by the National Weather
Service, but some early guesses ranged from Freeport, about 30
miles southwest of Galveston, to the Louisiana coast.
   ``A hurricane is like a gorilla; normally it goes where it
really wants to go,'' said Harlingen TV forecaster Larry James.
   Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in
Coral Gables, Fla., said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that
Texas and Louisiana residents ``ought to be thinking about what
they're going to do in case warnings are posted for their area.''
   Asked about the threat to the United States, Sheets said,
``We're looking at about 48 hours or so, maybe as much as 60 hours,
but probably somewhere on the Texas or Louisiana coast. There's a
little uncertainty exactly where this hurricane's going to go.''
   Robert Lansford, state coordinator of the governor's division of
emergency management in Austin, said on ``Good Morning America''
that he thought the state had time to prepare. ``We've got our
fingers crossed,'' he added.
   ``Local governments along the coast have been working feverishly
for the last 24 hours trying to get ready for this thing, trying to
find out where it's going to go,'' Lansford said.
   For the second time in two weeks, oil companies evacuated
thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf. Last week, workers were
brought inland when Hurricane Florence washed ashore in Louisiana.
   Bill Tompkins, coordinator for the Galveston County emergency
preparedness, said communications systems were being tested and
procedures were being reviewed. Based on forecasts from at least
four sources, he expected the storm to be in the gulf by Thursday
morning.
   ``That's probably our most critical time,'' he said. ``We'll be
making decisions Thursday morning about what to recommend to the
citizens.''
   In Brownsville, Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said he has
already posted special schedules for his officers to follow if a
hurricane watch is issued.
   ``We've contacted all the schools for shelters, to see which
ones we'll be using this time,'' said Perez. ``We're getting all
the emergency generators ready for the jails, and getting extra gas
for the patrol cars and getting everything set up.''
   Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.
in Lafayette, La., said his company's 18 bases in the Gulf Coast
region were operating at full capacity evacuating the rigs. He
estimated that all the 10,000 or so workers who normally work the
gulf would be evacuated by this afternoon.
   ``I don't think anybody's going to ride this one out,'' he said.
``We've got to have about a 24-hour cushion to play with this one.''
   At the South Texas Nuclear Project near Bay City, employees
secured down loose objects at a reactor under construction.
Employees reviewed procedures at the other reactor, which is in
operation, said spokesman Glen Walker.
   The plant is 13 miles from the coast and its containment center
is built to withstand nature's forces _ including earthquakes and
370 mph winds, he said.
   ``The plant is probably the safest, most hurricane-proof plant
along the Gulf coast,'' he said.
   At NASA's Johnson Space Center, spokesman Kyle Herring said the
hurricane would not delay the flight of space shuttle Discovery,
scheduled for launch later this month from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center and major hospitals asked
for blood donations.
   In low-lying southern Louisiana today, schools closed early,
coastal residents headed inland and workers prepared evacuation
centers.
   Apprehensive residents in Galveston crowded stores in search of
provisions such as batteries and plywood to board up windows.
   ``I stayed here for (Hurricane) Alicia because I didn't realize
how bad it was going to be,'' said Verne Gordon. ``But I vowed I'd
never stay again.''
   ``I really think Alicia is what has scared almost all of us.''
   In 1983, Alicia killed 21 people, injured 1,800 and caused an
estimated $3 billion in damages when it slammed ashore and blasted
Galveston and Houston. But Alicia was a minimal Category 3 on the
Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength with top winds at 130
mph, compared to the Gilbert's Category 5 and 175 mph winds Tuesday.
   The scale lists such a storm as potentially causing catastrophic
damage and having a storm surge of greater than 18 feet. The
weather service said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm
on record in terms of barometric pressure.
   In September 1900, Galveston was the scene of the nation's worst
natural disaster, when an estimated 6,000 people were killed in a
hurricane.
   Off Louisiana's coast, the only school on Grand Isle _ Grand
Isle High School _ was to close early today and remain closed
Thursday and Friday. The town of about 2,000 lies unprotected,
connected to the mainland by a two-lane highway.
   ``We wanted to get the kids out of school before they call an
evacuation,'' said school official Irwin Rhodes Jr., explaining
that buses bringing children home would impede evacuation.

   Leonid I. Brezhnev's grandson complained in an
article published today that criticism of the late Soviet leader
had turned into a smear campaign.
   Andrei Brezhnev said his family should not be blamed for the
mistakes made by the late Soviet leader.
   The full-page article in the weekly Moscow News was a rare
public defense of the man who served as Communist Party chairman
and president in the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in 1982.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the official press
carries almost daily articles and letters criticizing Brezhnev for
everything from the slump in the economy to his large collection of
medals.
   Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, is on trial in Moscow on
charges of bribe-taking and abuse of office as a top Interior
Ministry official under Brezhnev.
   Andrei Brezhnev said the disgrace of his grandfather was hurting
him. He is the son of Yuri Brezhnev.
   ``I'm 27 years old, and my independent life is only beginning,
but I already feel that my surname ever more frequently has become
a stumbling block in the most varied situations,'' the younger
Brezhnev wrote. ``I am just like everyone, but many don't want to
see anything in me except my surname.''
   Brezhnev's grandson said he agreed with much of the criticism
appearing now in the Soviet press of the former Soviet president
and Communist Party chief, but that relatives should not share the
blame.
   He recalled that under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, relatives
were arrested or shot simply because of their family ties with
criminals.
   ``If you read now about the crimes of the 1930s, we remember the
words: `A son should not answer for his father,' then why do we
forget them when speaking about the present day?''
   Andrei Brezhnev also said some criticism was unjustified because
it blamed his grandfather for mistakes made by aides.
   Legends and rumors arose about Brezhnev's family, he said,
because ``the private life of our leaders, their family
irregularities and problems remain outside the direct attention of
society, outside `glasnost.'''
   Glasnost, Gorbachev's policy of openness, has generally not been
extended to reporting on the inner workings of the top government
and party organizations or the personal lives of leaders.
   ``First and foremost Brezhnev himself became a victim of the
absence of glasnost,'' Andrei Brezhnev said.
   He said his aunt, Brezhnev's daughter Galina, helped bring down
the family name because she was ``uncontrollable'' and didn't
respect the law. She is married to Churbanov.
   In its edition last week, Moscow News published an article by
historian Roy Medvedev saying that Brezhnev was revived from
``clinical death'' in 1976. However, the article said the leader
was left senile and so weakened that he had difficulty performing
simply protocol duties for the last six years of his rule.
   Medvedev also said that politically, Brezhnev ``didn't so much
move ahead himself as he was moved ahead by others.'' Medvedev also
criticized Brezhnev as a poor speaker and a vain, weak man.

throughout the nation.
   Sept. 9
   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on Pentagon spending:
   The Pentagon still can't seem to get a handle on how much money
to spend.
   It seems that some defense contractors have been hiding
information that would bring down prices on weapons purchased by
the Pentagon. As a result, the Pentagon has spent millions of
dollars more than it needed to for the weapons.
   Officials at the Pentagon have had some success halting
overpricing. But contractors still aren't complying with a 1962 law
requiring contractors to disclose relevant information about
contracts.
   But the contractors aren't entirely to blame. It boils down to a
case of mismanagement within the Pentagon.
   It's always easier to be easy with someone else's money _ in
this case ours. Despite the improvements and efforts by Pentagon
officials to clean up the contracts, more improvements obviously
are needed.

   The Daily Astorian, Astoria, Ore., on ``the imperial Congress'':
   The most dangerous trend in our government is the entrenchment
of the House of Representatives. We have allowed the creation of a
permanent class of lawmakers. ...
   It is well understood in the political community ... that a
House member who gets past his first re-election (has) ... got a
seat in Congress for life. And at the end of the line, he will get
a pension on the order of $76,000 per year. And free health care.
...
   It does the country no good to have a defeat-proof Congress. Is
there any mystery why the boys and girls on Capitol Hill have
ceased to make substantial law and pass only humongous, unwieldy
statutes that contain all sorts of surprises?
   The Senate used to be known as the most exclusive club in the

   The State, Columbia, S.C., on political prisoners and hostages:
   Again a rumor has surfaced that Swedish diplomat Raoul
Wallenberg is alive and being held in a Soviet prison camp. ...
   Wallenberg, who saved thousands of Jews from the Nazis during
World War II, disappeared in the Soviet prison system after the
war. The Soviet government has maintained that he died of a heart
attack in 1947 at the age of 35.
   But over the years, numerous witnesses have reported that he was
still alive. Most recently, Swedish businessman and novelist Kenne
Fant said he has been researching the Wallenberg case and has
information that he was alive in December 1986.
   But Wallenberg is only one example. Thousands of other political
prisoners and hostages are confined in Soviet gulags, Central and
South American jails and Middle East terrorist hideouts.
   It is far too easy, after 40-odd years, to forget about the
likes of Raoul Wallenberg. ...
   But this country and other free nations cannot afford to forget
these men and women _ prisoners, not for their deeds, but for their
beliefs. They have no one else to speak and work for their release.

   The Central Maine Morning Sentinel, Waterville, Maine, on the
Pledge of Allegiance as a campaign issue:
   Vice President George Bush has a real crowd pleaser in his flag
pledge speech, but as an issue, the Pledge of Allegiance is a
spurious one.
   Indeed, by the time the November election date rolls around it
largely will be forgetten.
   When they look beyond the histrionics, voters will find that it
isn't a question of whether George Bush or Michael Dukakis is the
more patriotic. Both have served their country, and the patriotism
of neither is in doubt. ...
   Laws or no laws, court decisions or no court decisions, 99
percent of the American people proudly recite the Pledge of
Allegiance. ...
   Forcing the other one percent to say it against their will
wouldn't make them patriotic.
   There are plenty of real issues for Vice President Bush and Gov.
Dukakis to talk about and debate. Let's get on with them.

   The (Baltimore) Sun on the presidential campaign:
   With two months to go until election day, George Bush has jumped
into a lead over Michael Dukakis that dismays Democrats and has
Republicans talking of another sweep.
   With voters so volatile, all of this could change _ especially
in the crucial fortnight between the end of the World Series and
Nov. 8. ...
   Dukakis prides himself on being a marathoner who likes to stay
in stride and not be deflected off path. His aides are counting on
Bush gaffes and Dan Quayle's liabilities to turn the polls around.
...
   What marathoner Dukakis seems not to realize is that he is now
in a 60-day dash. His proclaimed coolness on TV may serve him well
in the debates, but Bush's hot one-liners, served up daily against
photogenic backdrops, are what are being run and re-run on nightly
news shows. ...
   It may be too early for Dukakis to sprint, but he had better
step up his pace and run a smarter race if he wants to stay
competitive.

   Fairmont (Minn.) Sentinel on making English the official U.S.
language:
   A recent report by the Center for Immigration Studies indicates
that a record number of immigrants will be coming to America in
this decade.
   This latest report estimates that between 1981-1990, more than
10 million immigrants will have crossed America's shores.
   This will mark only the second time in one decade that the
number of new arrivals has surpassed 8 million since 1820, when the
government began keeping such records.
   The recent tidal wave of immigrants ... has given additional
impetus to a growing national movement to make English the official
language of our country.
   So far, 16 states have passed legislation designating English as
the official language; three other states will have the issue on
the ballot in November. We support this effort.
   If America is to remain a melting pot for people from all the
nations, then English should be the only language, for documents,
ballots and all official communications.

   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel promises an end to the ``let it

   The ``let it burn'' policy was intended to clear out fallen
timber and revive forests.
   Instead, 883,000 acres have been lost in Yellowstone alone.
   This is one time when both the environmentalists and the federal

   Antiques, coins, fine art, handicrafts and stamps are among the
collectibles that are ``good investments'' only for those who have
studied and know their markets.
   Those who don't, depending instead on stories of spectacular

promoters eager to exploit their desire for easy wealth.
   For example, the Anthony dollar is being promoted as a ``worthy
family heirloom'' at more than $150 a set of 12.
   In fact, Anthony dollars are worth $1. More than half a million
of these coins, rejected by the public, lie uncirculated in

   Los Angeles Herald Examiner on stopping gang violence:
   For the estimated 70,000 gangsters, mostly young men and boys
under 20, mostly inhabitants of the region's poorer sections, the
gang is a clan _ a supplement to, or a replacement for, family
ties. ...
   Most hard-core gang members are unskilled school dropouts. ...
Most live in poor, racially segregated neighborhoods, where wages
are low and unemployment, drug addiction and crime are high. ...
   The gang offers what they can get nowhere else: protection and
complete acceptance, no diploma required. ...
   Firepower and ruthlessness have increased. Once gangs used
chains, stilettos and the occasional zip gun or revolver to fight
rivals or abet crimes. Today, legal and illegal rapid-fire pistols
and rifles of immense force have become the weapons of choice.
   Gang killings were once rare. From the 1940s until 1977, there
were only about 100 for all of Los Angeles. Since then, there have
been more than 3,100. ...
   Children must ... be the prime target of the community's effort
to rid Los Angeles of gang violence. Simply put, we must cut gangs
off from the flow of new soldiers.

   Yakima (Wash.) Herald-Republic on school curricula:
   William Bennett may be a lame duck, having decided to depart his
post in several weeks, but the Reagan administration's outspoken
education secretary is without peer in diagnosing what ails the
public schools.
   In his final report to the nation, Bennett challenged grade
school educators to upgrade their curricula and improve the
preparation of students entering high school and college.
   Although the secretary praised elementary schools for improving
their class offerings, nonetheless he urged educators to expose
their students to much stronger doses of English, math, science,
history, geography, fine arts and, yes, foreign languages in the
nation's 81,000 elementary and junior high schools. ...
   Bill Bennett is detested by many in the educational
establishment for his uncompromising pursuit of classroom
excellence.
   Fortunately, his common sense recommendations are supported by
most Americans who understand the time has come after years of
mediocrity for higher academic standards. The very future of the
United States depends upon it.

   The Syracuse (N.Y.) Post Standard and Herald Journal of the
Yonkers desegregation case:
   It's time for Yonkers to get on with its life. The wounds from
the city's bitter battle over court-ordered housing desegregation
will take some time to heal, but no one will be served by keeping
them open out of spite. ...
   Last month, after the council balked at an agreement to build
200 units of low-income housing and 800 subsidized middle-income
units, (U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Sand) imposed fines that
threatened to bankrupt the city.
   On Saturday (Sept. 10), two members of the city council changed
their votes on the controversial housing plan in the face of $1
million-a-day fines and the prospect of laying off city workers.
That made the vote 5-2 in favor of the proposal. ...
   Now that the ugly fight is over, let us hope the people of the
city can work together to make the housing plan succeed _ that
Yonkers can be added to the growing list of communities where
people have found that black and white can live side-by-side and
enrich the quality of life for both.

   Saginaw (Mich.) News on the media and Dan Quayle:
   News organizations are reporting news about news organizations,
and commenting on it, more than ever.
   The introspection reached a peak when the Dan Quayle story
became two stories _ one focusing on his decision to join the
National Guard rather than sign up for the Vietnam War, the other
examining whether or not reporters went ``too far'' in probing the
Republican nominee for vice president. ...
   The public relies on the media for information, and citizens
should be privy to the decision-making process involved in
publishing a newspaper or preparing a broadcast. ...
   (But) news organizations can eliminate the need for a
story-by-story media catharsis if they stress a consistent,
back-to-basics approach that relies on the fundamental concepts of
journalism. ...
   If reporters keep their opinions to themselves and show less
arrogance, they can cover the important stories _ and Quayle's
background indeed is important _ without so much public backlash.

   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on Dan Quayle:
   It's not that (Sen. Dan Quayle) chose to avoid combat by joining
a stateside National Guard unit. It's not even the fact that he
used family pressures to get him to the front of the enlistment
line.
   It's the senator's subsequent hawkish support of the military
and his showy patriotism that make him suspect.
   The young senator might have recovered lost respect had he
responded to the embarrassment with grace.
   Instead he was flippant. ``If I had known then I would be
running for the vice presidency now, I certainly would have chosen
a different course,'' he said at one point.
   To a convention breakfast audience, he offered a mock salute and
his National Guard name, rank and serial number in attempt to laugh
the whole thing off.
   Is a man who reacts so awkwardly to what is, essentially, a
less-than-major crisis, the man we would trust in a time of
national emergency?

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on mail solicitation:
   You take the official-looking envelope from the mailbox and your
heart skips a beat. It's from the Internal Revenue Service and
surely couldn't be good news.
   Look again. It's from the Internal Review Service, which is not
a government agency. It's nothing more than a company looking to
make a buck by wrapping its services in government-like mailings.
   Your reaction is similar to that by elderly citizens who learn
the official-sounding Social Security Protection Bureau is not the
Social Security Administration.
   Rep. Frank McCloskey (D-Ind.) says such firms often solicit
funds for services that are available free from the federal
government.
   Now, a bill sponsored by McCloskey has passed the House. It
would require warning labels on such envelopes, making it clear
that the mailings do not contain government documents. ...
   Any company that would prey on the unsuspecting should be made
to come clean, on the outside of the envelope.

   The Reporter, Fond du Lac, Wis., on the NFL drug policy:
   The National Football League's substance abuse policy is
continuing to take its toll and, frankly, we're glad to see it.
   Images created by drug-popping role-model NFL superstars are not
the ones most parents want their children to see. The league's
moves to stop drug abuse and to show that it has undesirable
consequences are laudable. ...
   This is the third year of the NFL's drug testing program. Teams
of first-time offenders are notified by the league's drug office.
Second-time offenders draw minimums of 30-day suspensions and
third-timers can be banished for life although they can petition
for readmission after a year.
   To players drawing the salaries paid in the NFL today, even a
30-day suspension can be expensive. A year can be devastating.
   But it should be. These overpriced players who so eagerly seek
professional help in negotiating their salaries could use a little
help in spending them as well.
   A year back at more mundane earning levels goes a long way
toward restoring reality to their lives.

   More than 100,000 shouting protesters
Wednesday told leaders of the authoritarian government to resign or
die and demanded that an interim administration lead Burma back to
democracy.
   The student-led protesters flooded all main Rangoon streets to
reject the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party and its 26 years of
repression and ruinous economic policies. They rejected President
Maung Maung's plan for multiparty elections.
   ``Step down fascist BSPP government!'' and ``Give us an interim
government!'' shouted the demonstrators, who included Buddhist
monks and government employees.
   ``You run or we will kill you!'' the marchers shouted, thrusting
fists in the air. ``If they don't fall, make them fall!'' they
chanted.
   All shops and offices were closed Wednesday. Crowd estimates
ranged from 100,000 to 1 million.
   State-run Radio Rangoon urged workers to return to their jobs.
Many employees nationwide struck Aug. 8 to demand democracy, and
food and other commodities have since been in increasingly short
supply.
   Strikes shut down the country's two oil refineries making fuel
scarce and forcing the army to use reserve stocks. Foreign
embassies have turned to the black market and are paying $16 for a
gallon of gasoline, sources said.
   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said the marchers, accompanied by
marching bands, included about 100 uniformed policemen and pilots
and stewardesses whose pro-democracy strikes have grounded all
commercial flights since last week.
   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several
thousand demonstrators gathered outside the U.S. Embassy, a
favorite rallying place, and listened to strident speeches by
protest leaders.
   Diplomats said they had no indication the authorities would
yield to demands for an interim government.
   Demonstrations and pro-democracy strikes also continued in major
towns nationwide, including Mandalay, Taunggyi, Moulmein and
Bassein, but details were not available. Western diplomats have
said protesters have taken control of the administrations of about
40 towns.
   After weeks of demonstrations, Maung Maung's government
announced last weekend that it would end one-party rule and hold
the first multiparty elections since 1960 as early as late October.
   But demonstrations have continued. On Tuesday, opposition
leaders told the five-member election commission they would accept
no polling organized by the current government.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, former Brigadier General Aung Gyi and former
Defense Minister Tin Oo declared they would not support or
participate in government-organized elections and reiterated their
demand for an interim government.
   They also complained that holding the elections in three months
or less would be unfair because the opposition would not have time
to form parties and raise funds, state-run Radio Rangoon reported.
   On Monday the three issued their first joint statement, a letter
to Maung Maung calling for an interim government.
   The Western diplomat said the opposition leaders were expected
to announce Thursday the names of people they want in the
transition government.
   ``There has not been a groundswell of support for any one
opposition leader as there was in the Philippines when people were
shouting, `Cory, Cory,''' the diplomat said, speaking anonymously.
He was referring to the February 1986 popular uprising that swept
President Corazon Aquino to power.
   ``So far the students have been concentrating on scrutinizing
the abuses of the regime and not the relative merits of the
different opposition leaders,'' he said.
   Burma's last multiparty elections, on Feb. 6, 1960, swept former
Prime Minister U Nu to power over an army-backed party. He was
toppled in the 1962 coup led by Ne Win, who crushed dissent and
pursued rigid socialist policies that made resource-rich Burma into
one of the world's poorest nations.
   Massive protests began after Ne Win resigned July 23 and the
party named hardliner Sein Lwin his successor. Sein Lwin resigned
after rioting in which at least 112 people died in Rangoon, and on
Aug. 19, Maung Maung became Burma's first civilian leader since Nu.

<TEXT>
   India on Wednesday announced a five-day
ceasefire in Sri Lanka to allow Tamil rebels fighting for an
independent homeland to surrender their arms and take part in local
elections.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab Seth made the announcement to
reporters in a government statement. The cease-fire was to begin at
7 a.m. Thursday.
   India has stationed an estimated 47,000 troops in Sri Lanka's
northern and eastern provinces to enforce an accord aimed at ending
the Tamils' 5-year-old separatist war with the Sinhalese-dominated
government. The campaign has claimed at least 8,500 lives.
   The cease-fire comes five days after the merger of the two
Tamil-dominated provinces and an announcement by the Colombo
government that the election of a combined provincial council would
be held soon. A date for the polls has yet to be announced.
   ``At this juncture it is therefore of the greatest importance
that all Tamil groups in Sri Lanka use this historic opportunity to
come forward and participate in the forthcoming provincial council
elections,'' the Indian statement said.
   ``The government of India hopes that all Tamil groups will ...
come forward and join the mainstream of life and play an effective
role in ensuring the welfare of the people of the northeastern
province,'' it said.
   ``All groups wishing to participate in the elections must lay
down their arms and support the Indo-Sri Lanka agreement,'' the
statement said.
   In Colombo, a senior government official said the announcement
was sudden.
   ``Nobody knows what is going on because this is an Indian
decision,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Everybody obviously welcomes the cease-fire, but it will have to
be studied before any official comments can be made.''
   None of the Tamil groups commented on the announcement.
   The India-brokered peace accord stipulates the surrender of arms
by the insurgents in exchange for limited autonomy in the provinces.
   The rebels briefly accepted the July 1987 accord, but reneged on
it last fall, claiming it did not meet their aspirations.
   India, which sponsored the accord because of the sympathies of
its own 60 million Tamils, sent troops to Sri Lanka last October to
force the Tamils to surrender.
   At least 575 Indian soldiers have been killed in hit-and-run
attacks by the rebels, and more than 1,700 have been wounded. India
claims its soldiers have killed more than 1,500 rebels and captured
1,300 others but says the Tamil movement is still far from finished.
   The accord also has been criticized by the Sinhalese, the
majority in Sri Lanka. They say the accord grants too many
concessions to the Tamils. Sinhalese extremists have vowed to kill
anyone who supports the accord and have been blamed for at least
500 deaths since July, including members of the governing United
National Party.
   The Sinhalese also have opposed the merger of the northern and
eastern provinces, saying that while the north is Tamil-dominated,
the eastern province is multi-racial.
   Sinhalese extremists have killed at least 26 people since Monday
in an apparent reaction to the merger announcement.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, and
the Sinhalese make up 75 percent. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus,
claim they are discriminated by the mainly Buddhist Sinhalese, who
control the island's military and government.

   Mail to Britain was embargoed last week because of the strike,

<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on a 10
to 9 party-line vote today approved and sent to the Senate floor
legislation imposing harsh economic sanctions against
white-dominated South Africa.
   Immediately after the vote, leading Senate Democrats hailed the
action as an important step against South Africa's system of racial
apartheid and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called on Republican
presidential candidate George Bush to reverse course and support it.
   ``We would certainly welcome his support on this measure,''
Kennedy said. ``We have welcomed other election-year conversions on
the part of Mr. Bush. He has indicated he wanted to broaden his
mandate. He has an excellent opportunity to speak to that issue.''
   Bush has opposed the legislation which would impose a near-total
trade embargo against South Africa and require the withdrawal of
all U.S. business investment six months to a year after enactment.
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis has supported the
bill's attempt to increase the cost of maintaining apartheid on the
South African government.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a principal author of the
sanctions bill, told reporters that if Republicans maintain a solid
front against the measure it will be difficult to cut off a
threatened filibuster against it or to override a likely veto by
President Reagan should it be approved.
   He said the Senate's Democratic leadership might consider
attaching the sanctions bill as an amendment to some other
legislation in an effort to assure there is a recorded Senate vote
on sanctions before Congress adjourns next month.
   The committee vote took place after Cranston modified the bill
to remove a provision that could have caused foreign oil companies
to lose American oil leases if they acted to undercut the sanctions
legislation.
   Opponents of the measure had said they feared the provision
might cause retaliation by other countries against American oil
copmpanies, especially those active in oil exploration and drilling
in British territorial waters in the North Sea.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the committee's ranking GOP member and
leading opponent of sanctions legislation, complained that Cranston
was unfairly violating a committee agreement and moving to change a
bill Helms called a ``turkey.''
   ``It's a one-legged turkey that I knew was going to hop around,
but it's going nowhere,'' Helms said. Supporters have admitted they
do not have the votes needed to cut off Senate debate and force a
vote or the votes to override a near-certain presidential veto if
it passes.
   Cranston said he had the right to modify the legislation since
he sponsored it and said: ``Sen. Helms wants to do nothing to
improve the bill and nothing to move against apartheid.''
   The committee's 10 Democrats voted for the measure and the nine
Republicans against it.
   The bill, intended as a follow-up to a set of milder sanctions
enacted over a Reagan veto in 1986, would require an end to most
trade with South Africa and the withdrawal of most U.S. business
investment from the racially divided nation.
   The House approved similar legislation on Aug. 11.
   Republican opponents of the measure passed up an opportunity
last week to vote on amendments as some GOP senators said changes
might make the bill more acceptable and therefore harder to oppose.
   The 1986 sanctions bill was supported by a broad coalition of
senators from both parties.
   But only a few Republicans have indicated they are ready to
support a stronger set of sanctions, with some contending that a
trade embargo and disinvestment would end any leverage the United
States may have to encourage Pretoria to end the country's system
of forced racial separation and control known as apartheid.
   They also said that adopting the sanctions bill now would
foreclose the options of the next president whether he be
Republican George Bush, who opposes sanctions, or Democrat Michael
Dukakis, who favors them.
   The State Department also opposes the legislation, contending
its passage might disrupt U.S.-mediated talks among South Africa,
Angola and Cuba aimed at South African withdrawal from the
territory of South West Africa, or Namibia, and the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola.
   Democrats said the bill represents the only remaining means of
sending a strong signal to South Africa that the United States is
willing to pay a price to end the apartheid system.
   They said the issue is a moral one, not political, and that
sanctions represent the only available way to forestall a violent
revolution inside South Africa by moving that country toward
multiracial democratic rule.

   Scientists today reported finding signs of
a genetic difference in cells that could help identify people
likely to become alcoholics.
   The researchers are hopeful the discovery may also explain why
some people become addicted to alcohol and how that can be
prevented.
   Studies showed that descendants of white blood cells taken from
alcoholics adapt to alcohol more quickly than normal cells.
   The abnormal response was in the cells' production of a
messenger molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP.
The molecule is used in all cells to relay messages from outside
the cell to various locations inside.
   The researchers previously noted cAMP abnormalities in the cells
of actively drinking alcoholics. In an effort to find the cause of
the abnormalities, they raised cells from alcoholics for up to six
generations over seven or eight days without exposing the cells to
alcohol.
   These ``teetotaler cells'' showed surprisingly high levels of
cAMP, three times the level found in descendants of cells taken
from non-alcoholics.
   The researchers also found the cells with the high cAMP levels
had an increased sensitivity to alcohol while the progeny of cells
taken from non-alcoholics showed no significant change.
   The discovery took place at the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research
Center at the University of California at San Francisco. The
findings are reported in the mid-September issue of the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences by Dr. Ivan F. Diamond, Laura
E. Nagy and Adrienne Gordon.
   The evidence of a genetic difference is not conclusive, but it
appears to confirm prior epidemiologic findings that there is a
genetic component to alcoholism, the scientists said.
   ``Because the sensitivity could be genetic, we now have to go
out and do genetic studies in families and confirm that this
increased sensitivity to alcohol is the reason why certain people
are at risk to become addicted to alcohol,'' said Diamond, a
professor of neurology, pediatrics and pharmacology at UCSF and
director of the Gallo Center.
   Diamond said that alterations in the cAMP levels may help
explain withdrawal symptoms and other problems associated with
alcoholism.
   Volunteers in the study included actively drinking alcoholics
with a lifetime ethanol consumption of at least one ton and
non-alcoholics drawn from a local Mormon church group and
laboratory staff.

<TEXT>
   Five months after lawmakers ousted Gov. Evan
Mecham from office, voters have given him a measure of vengeance by
rejecting seven Republican legislators who helped impeach and
convict him.
   ``We stand at the dawn of a great awakening in Arizona,'' Mecham
supporter Jerry Gillespie said Tuesday night after defeating Senate
President Carl Kunasek in the GOP primary by 6,548 votes to 5,610
votes. ``The people of this state have begun the process of
regaining control of their state government.''
   But the results of the voting hardly constituted a sweep by the
pro-Mecham forces. Republicans who opposed him had little
difficulty gaining nomination in areas outside of his traditional
strongholds of rural Arizona and some parts of suburban Phoenix.
   Overall, 35 GOP legislators faced primary challenges, and 27 of
those advanced to the general election. One of the losers was Rep.
Gary Giordano, a conservative and a Mecham supporter who lost his
north Phoenix seat to a moderate.
   Tuesday's primary was the first legislative election since the
Republican-controlled House impeached the ultra-conservative Mecham
in February and the GOP-controlled Senate convicted him in April of
obstructing justice and misusing funds. That automatically
installed Democrat Rose Mofford, the longtime secretary of state,
in his place until 1990.
   Among those losing a bid for renomination was House Speaker Joe
Lane, who started the impeachment process last fall. Mecham backers
Lloyd Fenn and Warren Shumaker captured both GOP slots in his
district.
   ``I'm not sure next year's going to be very much fun for anyone
down at the Legislature,'' Lane had said Tuesday night as the
results became clear.
   Without the impeachment proceedings, ``I believe the speaker and
the president of the Senate would have been re-elected,'' Mecham
said Wednesday in a telephone interview from his Glendale home.
   But he also said the real issue in the primary was the
incumbents' votes for higher taxes, approved after he was removed
from office to remedy a budget deficit.
   The other casualties were pro-impeachment Sens. Peter Kay of
Phoenix and Jack Taylor of Mesa, along with pro-impeachment Reps.
Bob Hungerford of Phoenix, Bob Broughton of Mesa and Don Strauch of
Mesa.
   ``It's a `Mecham factor' if you ask me,'' Taylor said. ``But
I'll tell you, if I was asked to vote again tomorrow, I'd vote to
impeach him.''
   Mecham, asked about the implications for his own political
future, replied: ``I've said many times that the result of the 1988
elections was not a vote on whether I should run in '90 or not.
That decision will be made by me sometime in the middle of next
year.''
   In southeastern Arizona's 5th Congressional District, two-term
GOP incumbent Jim Kolbe handily defeated his challengers, including
former Douglas Mayor Alberto Rodriguez, whose nomination for state
liquor superintendent Mecham withdrew when Rodriguez came under
investigation in a decades-old slaying. Kolbe had 38,169 votes, or
78 percent, to political newcomer Walt Weber's 5,855 votes, or 12
percent; Rodriguez had 5,077 votes, or 10 percent.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis spelled out positions on major weapons
systems and promised a White House ``strategy for keeping America
strong'' today as a new poll showed Republican George Bush with
wide support on defense issues.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, also focused on
military defense in a speech prepared for delivery in McAllen,
Texas. ``Under this administration, Buck Rogers has been promoted
and our conventional forces have been neglected,'' he said. ``In
the real world, real wars are still fought with real tanks and guns
and fighter planes.''
   President Reagan, campaigning for his vice president, said in
remarks prepared for delivery in Cape Girardeau, Mo., that the
election gives voters ``the choice between the policies of
liberalism or the policies of America's political mainstream.''
   Bush, campaigning for Hispanic votes at a Mexican restaurant in
Los Angeles, said today, ``They haven't begun to see me fight for
the vote of the Hispanic-Americans, all the way from the East Coast
to the West.''
   In a pitch on patriotism, he said sales of American flags have
risen since Reagan took office in 1981 ``whereas in the previous
administration things were rough in the flag business.''
   Dukakis officials released new details of the debate schedule,
saying the presidential contenders would follow their Sept. 25
meeting in Winston-Salem, N.C., with a debate in Los Angeles on
either Oct. 13 or 14. The vice presidential candidates will debate
Oct. 5 in Omaha, Neb.
   GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle planned a visit today
to NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, in Colorado.
   A new Gallup survey indicated Bush is leading by an 8-point
margin, and Dukakis is suffering his highest negative rating of the
presidential race. A CBS News-New York Times poll also showed the
Democratic nominee trailing by 8 points, and Bush capitalizing on
defense issues.
   A Los Angeles Times nationwide poll released today also showed
Bush's strength on the defense issue. Among registered voters
surveyed, 54 percent identified Bush as the candidate who would
best ensure a strong defense while only 20 percent answered Dukakis.
   The Democratic presidential nominee used a speech at Georgetown
University in Washington today to promise changes that would bring
order to Pentagon priorities after what he said were eight years of
Reagan administration waste and mismanagement.
   He endorsed a number of weapons, but he also said, ``We're not
going to have a laundry list of weapons systems. We're going to
have a strategy for keeping America strong.''
   Dukakis said he was committed to the traditional triad of land-,
air- and sea-based military capability. But he said criticized
Bush's defense recommendations and said the vice president has
failed to discuss the Pentagon procurement scandal.
   ``We have what you might call a new type of Republican triad
today: waste, duplication and fraud,'' he said.
   Dukakis repeated his promise to make improved conventional
forces his top defense priority if he is elected and said he
favored rapid development of new tanks and anti-tank weapons, the
Advanced Tactical Fighter, the SS-21 Sea Wolf fast-attack submarine
and new weapons to fight Soviet submarines.
   He expressed opposition to the proposed rail-based MX missile,
and he stated anew his concern that the B-1 bomber would be unable
to perform the job for which it was designed. Both the MX and the
B-1 are supported by Bush.
   Campaigning in Missouri on Tuesday, Bush pledged his support for
expansion of American markets abroad and suggested that Democrats
are only concerned with production controls, similar to the grain
embargo imposed by former President Carter.
   They want to ``control the lives of the farmers,'' the GOP
nominee said.
   Bush cited a published report that quoted a Dukakis aide as
saying the Democratic nominee might re-examine the U.S. policy of
selling government subsidized wheat to the Soviets.
   ``Can you imagine another president who leaves open the door of
using agriculture products to make the political points and using
our producers in that way?'' he asked.
   At the same time, the Republican Party unveiled a new television
commercial that uses a ``crime quiz'' to hit Dukakis on the law and
order issue.
   The ad scores the Democrat on issues such as the death penalty
and his state's inmate furlough program before an announcer asks
viewers, ``Which candidate for president can you really count on to
be tough on crime?'' The answer comes, ``George Bush.''
   The Bush campaign accepted the resignation of a seventh adviser
with alleged ties to anti-Semitic activities, hoping for an end to
the controversy.
   Radi Slavoff quit his post as national co-chairman of
``Bulgarians for Bush'' following a story in the Philadelphia
Inquirer that identified him as former chief of a Bulgarian group
formed after World War II which consisted of members of the
Nazi-aligned Bulgarian Legion.
   Defense plants are common stops on the GOP campaign trail but
now Dukakis has chosen the sites to counter Bush's attacks on his
defense record. The two latest polls indicate that Dukakis'
approach is a must.
   The CBS-Times poll, which showed Bush ahead 47-39 percent, found
that 28 percent of the probable voters surveyed believe Bush would
make the nation stronger while only 4 percent said he would weaken
its defense.
   In comparison, 39 percent said Dukakis would make U.S. defenses
weaker and 13 percent said stronger.
   The poll surveyed 1,043 probable voters from Thursday through
Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   The Gallup poll, which found Bush leading 49-41 percent, showed
that 40 percent have an unfavorable view of Dukakis, up from 32
percent last month and the Massachusetts governor's highest all
year. Fifty-three percent gave Dukakis a favorable rating.
   Bush had a 59 percent favorable rating and a 35 percent
unfavorable.
   The Gallup survey of 1,003 registered voters was done Friday
through Sunday and had a 4-point margin of error.
   The Los Angeles Times Poll was conducted over the weekend with
1,105 registered voters. Dukakis and Bush showed 47 percent support
among the 656 called most likely to vote.
   The Times poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis today endorsed a long list of weapons sstems he said made
sense for America's defense and would bring cohesion to Pentagon
priorities after eight years of Reagan administration waste and
mismanagement.
   ``We've got to have leadership in the Pentagon that will take
charge of our defense policy,'' Dukakis said in a speech at
Georgetown University. ``And we've got to have a president who will
keep faith with the men and women we ask to defend freedom and
liberty around the world.''
   While endorsing a number of weapons programs, Dukakis also
reiterated his opposition to several favored by Reagan and
Republican presidential nominee George Bush, including the
rail-based MX missile, and he expressed anew his concern that the
B-1 bomber would be unable to perform the job for which it was
designed.
   Dukakis said he favored continued research on a strategic
defense system but at about $1 billion a year, far below what
Reagan wants to spend on the so-called Star Wars system. Dukakis
also said that while he agreed in concept with the Midgetman
missile he was not convinced the costly program was needed to
modernize the land-based U.S. nuclear deterrent.
   Dukakis repeated his promise to make improved conventional
forces his top defense priority if he is elected and said he
favored rapid development of new tanks and anti-tank weapons, the
Advanced Tactical Fighter, the SS-21 Sea Wolf fast-attack submarine
and new weapons to fight Soviet submarines.
   He also reiterated his backing of the Trident II submarine-based
missile system, the Stealth bomber and advanced cruise missiles.
   ``We're not going to have a laundry list of weapons systems,''
Dukakis said. ``We're going to have a strategy for keeping America
strong.''
   Later, at a rally in Annapolis, Md., before heading home to
Boston, the Democratic nominee taunted Bush for refusing to agree
to a presidential debate originally scheduled for tonight in the
Maryland capital.
   ``If George Bush isn't ready today after more than seven and a
half years as vice president of this country, how can we expect him
to be ready on Jan. 20, 1989?'' Dukakis asked. ``Lloyd Bentsen and
I are ready.''
   He jokingly suggested that the reason Bush refused to come to
the home of the U.S. Naval Academy was ``that his idea of a naval
exercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard.'' That was a
reference to the recent resignation of six officials of a pro-Bush
ethnic campaign organization who allegedly had pro-Nazi or
anti-Semitic ties.
   At Georgetown University, Dukakis accused Bush of playing
politics by convincing Reagan to veto a defense authorization bill
recently passed with bipartisan support in Congress and said the
veto had prevented an expanded role for the Coast Guard in the war
on drugs and long-overdue pay and benefit increases for military
forces.
   ``My friends, we can't play politics with our national
security,'' Dukakis said.
   He promised to work diligently toward new arms control measures
and a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union but also said
he would demand significant cutbacks in Soviet conventional forces
in Europe and call for the dismantling of the Soviets' SS-18
missiles.
   Despite spending billions on defense, Dukakis said the Reagan
administration has done little to improve the nation's security.
   ``The fact is that the Republicans promised in 1980 to make our
land-based missiles invulnerable and, today, after another $25
billion and eight years of Republican mismanagement, our ICBMs are
more vulnerable that they were in 1980.''
   Dukakis said he was committed to the traditional triad of U.S.
defense policy: land-, air- and sea-based strategic capacities. But
he said Bush had shown no cohesion in his priorities and has failed
to discuss the Pentagon procurement scandal.
   ``We have what you might call a new type of Republican triad
today: waste, duplication and fraud,'' he said.
   Dukakis also said that as commander-in-chief he would not shy
away from using military force if necessary.
   ``We'll use force when it's necessary to protect our territory,
our citizens or vital interests; to meet our treaty commitments,
and to deter or respond to terrorist attacks,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An armed man who barricaded himself in
a house for more than 30 hours, convinced the world was coming to
an end as prophesied in a religious booklet, was overpowered by
police and arrested today, authorities said.
   Ricky Odell Chavis, 27, fired shots at passing motorists and a
police officer, but no one was injured, police said.
   ``He was messed up real bad on religion,'' said Chavis' aunt,
Joy Cassell.
   She said two door-to-door missionaries for the Jehovah's Witness
sect apparently convinced her nephew he needed to ``get right''
because Tuesday would be the day that God called true believers to
heaven.
   Edgar C. Whisenant predicted in his booklet ``88 Reasons Why the
Rapture Will Be in 1988,'' that Jesus would ``rapture the church''
and take the faithful to heaven by sunset Tuesday.
   Whisenant said Tuesday he still believed the ``rapture'' was
imminent and revised the moment to 10:55 a.m. EDT today. That
deadline passed without apparent incident.
   Chavis was arrested after negotiators got him to step outside
his back door shortly after 2 a.m. today, said police dispatcher
Susan Garinger. Sheriff's deputies then lobbed concussion grenades
at Chavis, stunning him, she said.
   Chavis was charged with assaulting a police officer with a
deadly weapon and terrorizing the public.
   Few preachers seemed to take the Whisenant book seriously.
   ``There are maybe a few concerned. There's a lot of interest,''
said the Rev. Richard D. White, pastor of the 2,000-member First
Baptist Church in Franklin, Tenn.
   ``We have difficulty with the book. The scripture is very clear
that that's not something known to man. It's known only to God.''
   Others said it didn't matter that the predictions were wrong.
   ``My awareness has been quickened and I'll never be the same,''
said Helaine Parker of Mount Juliet, Tenn. ``If people mock us, I'm
still happy because mockers are another biblical prophecy that will
come true in the last days.''
   A Duke University theologian said he won't be surprised if there
are more predictions of a Second Coming.
   ``Every time they predict and it doesn't come to pass ... they
don't get embarrassed by that. They just reload. And they say `We
miscalculated,''' said James Efird, professor of biblical
interpretation at Duke's Divinity School.
   About 1 million copies of the book have been circulated
throughout the nation, with about two-thirds sold for $2 and the
rest given away, said the Rev. Bob Doom, who runs a Christian
bookstore in Asheville, N.C.

<HEAD>Swedens Lodges Protest Over 1948 Slaying Of Swedish U.N. Mediator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday issued a
formal protest to Israel over the 1948 slaying of U.N. mediator
Folke Bernadotte by the Jewish underground Stern Gang. A former
member said the killing was justified.
   Israel's ambassador to Sweden was called to the Foreign Office
and handed a note expressing the government's ``shock,
dissatisfaction and indignation that Israel has not reacted after
the new reports about the murder,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said.
   In interviews broadcast and published over the weekend, members
of the now-defunct Israel Freedom Fighters, also known as the Stern
Gang, acknowledged they were involved in the shooting death of
Bernadotte on Sept. 17, 1948.
   They said Bernadotte, a Swedish count who was on a U.N. mission
in Palestine, was slain because of his plan to give the United
Nations control over Jerusalem and hand over key areas to the
Arabs. The group was a splinter faction of the right-wing National
Military Organization.
   Since the slaying, the group has been widely believed to be
responsible, but the killers were never found despite a widespread
manhunt.
   Ambassador Moshe Erell told reporters after the meeting
Wednesday that Israel expressed its regrets immediately after the
slaying and had not changed its position, national radio reported.
   He made no comments during the meeting with Ambassador Torsten
Ohrn, head of the Foreign Office Political section, the radio
reported.
   In 1945, Bernadotte led an International Red Cross operation
that rescued 30,000 concentration camp victims from Germany and
resettled them in Sweden.
   Yisrael Scheib-Eldad, a former member of the Stern Gang, told
Israel radio Wednesday the killing prevented ``a disaster for
Jerusalem and the state of Israel.''
   ``I'm not saying every assassination is good but this one was
good. I want to state that 40 years later. An act of individual
terror can be good and bad. In this case, it was good,'' said
Eldad, who has not claimed to be involved in the slaying.
   The underground group was named after leader Avraham Stern, who
was killed by British police in 1942. The group then was jointly
headed by Eldad, the late Natan Yellin-Mor and Yitzhak Shamir, who
is now Israel's prime minister.
   Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir has denied the premier was
involved in the killing and contended the group was officially
disbanded about four months before Bernadotte's death.

<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts of
the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and torrential
rains. Thousands of people fled coastal areas for shelters inland.
   ``The wind was blowing out windows everywhere'' in Cancun, an
official said of the resort where thousands of Americans vacation
each year.
   Residents along the gulf coast of Texas, 560 miles to the north,
stockpiled food and supplies and prepared to evacuate. Robert
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Florida, said
early today he expects Gilbert to make landfall on the
Texas-Louisiana coast in 48 to 60 hours.
   The hurricane, one of the strongest in history, is ``extremely
dangerous,'' the U.S. National Weather Service said. The storm's
winds reached 175 mph earlier today, but later fell slightly to 160
mph, the weather service said.
   Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the
Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
   Gilbert, which has killed at least 11 people, moved over the
island of Cozumel at 10 a.m. EDT, said Jose Pereira, a spokesman
for the governor's office in Merida, capital of Yucatan state.
   Pereira, who spoke by telephone from Mexico City, said heavy
rain was falling over the peninsula and communications with Cancun
and Cozumel were out. Cancun is 240 miles east of Medira. Cozumel
is 12 miles off the Yucatan coast.
   Military and civilian teams evacuated more than 16,000 people
from coastal areas on the upper Yucatan coast between Puerto
Progreso to Rio Lagartos, Pereira said. Most are in shelters in
inland towns, he said.
   ``Many people were reluctant to leave their homes,'' Pereira
said. ``They had to be convinced of the seriousness of the threat.''
   Officials in Merida last spoke with people in Cancun early today
before the center of the storm hit.
   ``Electricity is down,'' he said. ``We talked to them early in
the morning and they said it was impressive _ all dark. The people
were afraid. The wind was blowing out windows everywhere.''
   Heavy rains began in Merida about 6 a.m. EDT, and the storm was
expected to dump 5 to 10 inches on the area.
   The National Weather Service in Miami said the eye of the storm
was over northeast Yucatan at noon EDT. The center of the storm was
located near latitude 20.7 north and longitude 87.3 west, or about
150 miles east of Merida. The hurricane was moving toward the west
northwest at 15 mph.
   Gilbert pounded the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the
low-lying Cayman Islands Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. At least 11
people were reported killed, and at least 60,000 were left homeless
in Jamaica. Rescue teams worked desperately to restore utilities
and communications in the shattered areas.
   In a telephone call early today, receptionist Pablo Torres of
the Carrillos Hotel in Cancun said about 150 people, most of them
tourists, were crowded in the lobby on sofas and chairs.
   ``We are full, and there is not one tourist now in the beach
hotel zone,'' he said. ``The sound of the wind outside is horrible.
You couldn't leave even if you wanted to.''
   He said the winds felled utility poles and trees and that sheets
of rain were hitting the city.
   Jennie Valdez, a representative of the U.S. Consul, said she did
not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but that government
figures estimate between 40,000 and 65,000 a month. Cancun has a
population of about 100,000, she said.
   High winds also were reported in Valladolid, a city of 80,000
located 80 miles southwest of Cancun, said Jose Joaquin Martil,
local Red Cross president.
   Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga said late Tuesday that at
least six people were killed, and an estimated 60,000 were left
homeless in ``the worst natural disaster in the modern history of
Jamaica.''
   Civil defense officials in the Dominican Republic, sideswiped
Sunday by the storm, reported five people were known dead.
   The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure. It was measured at 26.31
inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane
that devastated the Florida Keys.
   ``That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western
Hemisphere,'' said forecaster Mark Zimmer.
   Gilbert is a Category 5 storm, the strongest and deadliest type
of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than
155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
   Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the
1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille
that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.

<HEAD>Postal Service Picks Up With 80,000 Staff Working</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postal service picked up today as more workers
returned to their jobs to begin sorting out the backlog of 150
million letters and parcels from a two-week dispute.
   Mail boxes will remain sealed, however, until backlogs are
mostly cleared, said Post Office spokeswoman Melanie Corfield.
   She said 80,000 of the service's 140,000 workers were back at
work today, two days after the strike was settled subject to local
negotiations over details of workers' return. About 100,000 workers
were involved in the stoppage called by the Union of Communication
Workers.
   ``All staff should be back to work Thursday,'' Ms. Corfield
said. ``But we will not start unsealing post boxes until the
backlog has been dealt with.''
   She said 34 of the country's 82 major sorting offices were
operating and about half of the total 1,500 letter-handling offices
had started up again.
   In London, only two of the city's 17 major sorting offices were
operating, she said. Staff at Glasgow, York and Hull have voted not
to return to work.
   The limited deliveries made Tuesday had increased today, she
said, although she did not have details.
   The agreement reached Monday resolved a dispute over regional
pay bonuses, an issue that prompted a 24-hour walkout Aug. 31 which
later mushroomed into nationwide strikes.
   The Post Office wants to pay bonuses to new workers in southeast
England where the high cost of living makes retaining workers
difficult. The union said it wanted the bonuses paid nationally or
not at all.
   Under the agreement, local negotiations were to discuss the
issue of whether temporary workers would be allowed to sort the
backlog, the union said.

<TEXT>
   The Sunday school lesson that morning 25
years ago was on forgiving love, but racial hatred that had gripped
Birmingham for months erupted in a dynamite explosion that tore
into the church and killed four black girls.
   The blast at the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963,
seared the conscience of Alabama's largest city, which had become
known as a segregationist battleground, and helped bring to it a
quarter-century of change.
   The bombing, which is to be marked in a service Thursday night,
came at a time when some city leaders already were trying to find a
way toward racial harmony.
   Less than a year earlier, the city government had been
reorganized to replace the powerful, three-member commission with a
nine-member city council. One of those commissioners, Eugene
``Bull'' Connor, had gained national notoriety when he ordered that
dogs and fire hoses be used against civil rights demonstrators.
   The bombing followed a series of blasts that had occurred since
the 1950s, although no one had died in the earlier explosions.
   The church, near the local office of Martin Luther King's
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was often used for
rallies by blacks seeking changes in what King had called the most
segregated city in the country.
   The Rev. John Cross, pastor of the church at the time, said at
least three bomb threats had been made before the bombing,
prompting all-night watches at the church for a while.
   ``We had just about relaxed the protection of the church,'' he
said. ``It looked like everything was working with ease. We thought
peace would prevail.''
   J.L. Lowe, who directed the church orchestra, said church
members ``said surely nobody's going to bomb the church while there
are inhabitants.''
   But at about 10:20 a.m. Sunday, Sept. 15, an explosion tore
apart the side entrance to the building. A bomb had been placed
beneath concrete steps near the window of a basement restroom.
   Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Dianne Wesley and Carole Robertson,
all 14, and Denise McNair, 11, were in the restroom preparing for a
special youth program. They were killed and two other girls were
injured.
   King, himself later the victim of an assassin's bullet, preached
at the combined funeral of three of the blast victims.
   The deaths touched off donations from around the country that
totaled $500,000, money used for the funerals and for repairs to
the church.
   Fourteen years later, a jury convicted Robert Edward Chambliss,
a retired automobile mechanic and Ku Klux Klansman, in the death of
Miss McNair, whose father, Chris McNair, now is a Jefferson County
commissioner. Chambliss died in prison in 1985 after serving eight
years of a life sentence for murder.
   Today, the only reminders of the blast at the 16th Street
Baptist Church are a plaque and memorial nook downstairs and
another memorial in the sanctuary with pictures of the four girls.
   ``If the bombing was meant to stop or deter the civil rights
movement, it did not,'' said the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a founder
of the movement in Birmingham and now a pastor in Cincinnati.
   ``We pick up the pieces, we bury our dead ... but we keep our
faith and keep on moving. I think these things do more solidifying
and bring about more determination than if they did not happen.''
   Today, Richard Arrington is in his third term as Birmingham's
first black mayor, the City Council has six blacks and three
whites, and long gone are the ``whites only'' signs at drinking
fountains, bus stations and restaurants.
   After the explosion, Cross, whose 4-year-old daughter was cut on
the forehead by flying glass, appealed to a crowd gathered in the
street to go home and pray.
   ``God, forgive them, for they know not what they do,'' he said.
   The Sunday lesson that morning, Cross said, had been about ``a
love that forgives. That's what we really had to practice for the
next several weeks and months and years _ and even now.''

   The land heaved and windows broke
more than two miles away Wednesday when the Soviet Union detonated
a underground nuclear bomb for the first American experts to
witness a Soviet nuclear blast.
   The Americans stood in a chilly wind on the barren test site at
the Forward Command Post Semipalatinsk Polygon about 1,700 miles
southeast of Moscow in the republic of Kazakhstan.
   The wind blew the Soviet and American flags in the direction of
the test range, far from the nearest settlement on the steppes of
Soviet Central Asia and a four-hour bus ride from the city of
Semipalatinsk.
   As the shock wave rippled out, the ground shook and a low rumble
began. Within moments of the 11 a.m. blast, a reddish dust cloud
rolled above the spot where Soviet scientists planted a nuclear
device in a shaft drilled 642 yards into hard rock.
   Some observers seemed a bit queezy from their proximity to
ground zero, only 2.4 miles away. Soviet observers watching a
similar test on Aug. 17 in Pahute Mesa, Nev., remained about 30
miles from the blast site _ too far away to feel the impact. It was
the first time Soviet experts were allowed to see a U.S. nuclear
test and monitor it with their own equipment.
   After Wednesday's test, the Soviet scientists quickly checked
their instruments and announced they had obtained the data
necessary to determine the force of the blast.
   The information was gathered in a few millionths of a second
before the explosion destroyed the sensor cable buried a few yards
from the nuclear device. The Soviets and the Americans, who
monitored the blast with U.S. technology, have agreed to release
the data within a month.
   The blast was designed to have a force of 100 to 150 kilotons,
about 10 times that of the atomic bomb the Americans dropped on
Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War II, but less powerful
than the multimegaton hydrogen bombs detonated in the atmosphere at
the height of nuclear testing in the 1960s.
   The Hagfors Observatory of the Swedish Defense Research
Establishment said the Semipalatinsk explosion measured between 50
and 150 kilotons.
   The joint experiment was the culmination of a ``dream for many
experts who have spent their careers watching and studying their
counterparts from a distance,'' said C. Paul Robinson, the chief
U.S. negotiator at the Geneva talks on limiting nuclear tests.
   ``We are extremely pleased,'' said Deputy U.S. Energy Secretary
Joseph Salgado Solgado. ``The experiment went very well for both
sides.''
   Igor M. Palenykh, head of the Soviet observation team, said,
``If the Americans had any doubt about our level of science and
technology in a nuclear field, now they know.''
   Both sides expressed confidence the test explosion would lead to
ratification of treaties limiting the size of underground nuclear
blasts.
   At a news conference in a trailer village that served as the
command post for the test, Salgado said Wednesday's experiment and
the one like it in Nevada ``have demonstrated the effectiveness and
non-intrusiveness of CORRTEX,'' the U.S. technology developed to
gauge the force of nuclear explosions.
   The Soviets, however, remain sceptical that the U.S. on-site
measuring system offers a long-term solution to the problem of
verifying nuclear tests.
   Lt. Gen. Arkady D. Ilyenko, chief of the Semipalatinsk test
site, said it was too early to determine whether the American
method was non-intrusive _ meaning it does not interfere with the
blast or pick up other data the country doing the testing would
like to keep secret.
   Ilyenko called for a continuing search for simpler, more precise
measuring techniques.
   Spokesmen for both sides agreed the experiments will speed
negotiations in Geneva on verification protocols needed to ratify
two treaties signed but not ratified in the 1970s that limit the
force of underground nuclear explosions. Robinson said the U.S.
side still hopes the treaties can be ratified before President
Reagan's term ends Jan. 20, 1989.
   The treaties limit underground nuclear test explosions to a
strength of 150 kilotons.
   The two superpowers say they will abide by the agreements, but
the United States has said it will not ratify the documents until
adequate provisions are included against cheating and monitoring
techniques both sides could use to measure tests and verify
compliance, according to Robinson.
   The talks on nuclear testing began in July 1986 and formal
negotiations started last November.
   
   The Soviets support a complete ban on nuclear testing.
Washington says the tests are necessary as long as nuclear weapons
exist, but want the number of nuclear explosions reduced in tandem
with arms stockpiles.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, under Republican
attack as weak on defense, came on like a hawk Wednesday, citing a
range of weapons systems he supports and accusing his opponents of
a ``smoke and mirrors'' military policy.
   ``We'll use force when it's necessary to protect our territory,
our citizens or our vital interests, to meet our treaty commitments
and to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks,'' the Democratic
presidential nominee said in a speech at Georgetown University.
   Portrayed by Republicans George Bush and Dan Quayle as an
opponent of most major weapons systems, Dukakis countered by
describing the nation's military as suffering from years of neglect
during the Reagan administration.
   Dukakis said there are shortages of tanks and anti-tank weapons
and carrier aircraft. And he said a backlog of undone essential
maintenance work in the Army and Air Force ``is greater now than it
was when this administration took office.''
   He also said there was a shortage of medical personnel.
   Dukakis said he would press ahead with development of the
Advanced Tactical Fighter and the Sea Wolf attack submarine, if
elected. He also criticized the administration for decommissioning
16 Navy frigates.
   The Massachusetts governor said Democrats and Republicans alike
have ``the job of defending freedom'' and added:
   ``George Bush unfortunately forgot that lesson last month when
he persuaded the president to veto the defense bill over the
objections of the secretary of defense and the national security
adviser. Mr. Bush's pollster apparently had more influence than
they did.''
   President Reagan complained at the time that the bill cut too
much into Star Wars funding and contained Democratic-written
arms-control provisions.
   In what has become a daily jab at the GOP vice presidential
nominee, Dukakis said, ``I'm not going to be looking for guidance
on national security issues from J. Danforth Quayle.''
   Later, at an Annapolis, Md., rally before he headed home to
Boston, the Democratic nominee taunted Bush for refusing to agree
to a debate originally scheduled for Wednesday night in the
Maryland capital.
   ``If George Bush isn't ready today after more than seven and a
half years as vice president of this country, how can we expect him
to be ready on January 20, 1989?'' Dukakis asked. ``Lloyd Bentsen
and I are ready.''
   He also took a poke at the vice president for the recent
resignations of six campaign advisers on ethnic voters because of
allegations that they had pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic ties.
   ``Maybe the reason George Bush won't come here to Annapolis
(home of the U.S. Naval Academy) is that his idea of a naval
exercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard,'' Dukakis
said.
   At Georgetown, the candidate was introduced by Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who said
the defense budget into the 1990s would be ``flat at best.'' He
said the next president would have to maintain a ``strong defense
in the face of restrained dollars.''
   Also seated on the stage was Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Responding to the Republican attacks, Dukakis said, ``We've had
a lot of nonsense lately from Mr. Bush on the subject of national
defense.''
   The Massachusetts governor said that the Trident II missile
program and development of the Stealth bomber were started under
Democratic President Jimmy Carter.
   He said that Reagan took office in 1981 with a promise to make
U.S. land-based missiles invulnerable to Soviet attack.
   But he said that after ``eight years of Republican
mismanagement, our ICBMs are more vulnerable than they were in
1980.''
   ``It's time for an end to Republican smoke and mirrors on
national defense,'' he said, calling the MX missile, which he
opposes, a ``sitting duck.''
   Dukakis also opposes the proposed Midgetman missile, a
single-warhead weapon favored by some as an alternative to the
multi-warhead MX.
   But in this speech, he tempered his opposition to Midgetman,
saying, ``The strategic concept of the Midegetman is sound, but I
question the value of spen
   
   
   
   ding $40 billion or $50 billion for 500 additional land-based
missile warheads _ at three times the cost of the same number of
new submarine-based warheads.'' Both Aspin and Nunn support the
missile.
   While seeking to clarify his own position on Star Wars, the
space-based missile defense system being pushed by the
administration, Dukakis accused Bush of waffling.
   ``I'm beinning to get the feeling that one of the reasons Mr.
Bush is so reluctant to debate me is that he's so busy debating
himself,'' he said. ``One day he wants to speed up SDI (Strategic
Defense Initiative). The next day he does not.''
   Dukakis, once counted a staunch opponent of SDI, has said he
would continue research and recently also said he would deploy it
if it were deemed essential to the national interest.
   At Georgetown he made no mention of deployment. Instead, he
said, ``If we're going to make our defense dollars count, we've got
to stop pouring billions and billions into this program and do some
hard thinking about what we're trying to achieve.''
   He said that rather than scrap the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
as some administration officials have suggested, ``I will protect
American security ... by insisting that the Soviets live up to it
and that they dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar.'' Administration
officials have called the radar a violation of the treaty.

<HEAD>Researcher Urges Use of Fetal Transplant Tissue to Treat
Parkinson's Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swedish doctor who has transplanted brain
cells from aborted human fetuses to patients with Parkinson's
disease said Wednesday the procedure is so promising it would be
unethical not to make it available to desperately ill people.
   Dr. Lars Olson, professor of neurobiology at Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm and one of the few people in the world to
have transplanted human fetal tissue, also told a National
Institutes of Health advisory committee the technique has been used
in Mexico, China, England and Cuba.
   There are no known cases of fetal tissue being transplanted as a
treatment for Parkinson's disease in the United States, but several
animal studies have suggested the procedure can be effective.
   Eugene Redmond Jr., professor of psychiatry at Yale University
School of Medicine outlined his work with green monkeys. With a
video tape, he showed remarkable improvement in monkeys in which
Parkinson's was induced and then treated with brain cells taken
from healthy monkeys.
   One of the questions the committee specifically has been asked
to answer is whether animal studies have been numerous and
successful enough to warrant going forward with similar
experimental treatment on humans.
   When one of the panel members directed that question to Olson,
he replied: ``The animal data ... are so promising we have
approached a point where I believe it is unethical not to do this
in human studies.''
   The special NIH advisory committee was appointed at the
direction of Dr. Robert E. Windom, the federal government's
assistant secretary for health, after he denied permission for NIH
scientists to proceed with human fetal tissue transplants without
formal consideration of moral and ethical questions raised by the
emerging field of research.
   Even before the group could hold its first meeting, however, it
was learned last week that a White House official has drafted a
proposed executive order that would ban all such research.
   Most of the opposition comes from people and organizations
opposed to abortion in general. They maintain that allowing such
research could encourage more abortions.
   The advisory committee devoted its first daylong session to
scientific issues and will turn to legal and ethical considerations
Thursday before draftings its recommendations on Friday.
   The matter then goes to a standing NIH advisory committee Dec. 1
for final recommendations to NIH Director James B. Wyngaarden.
   Despite the focus on presentations by some of the nation's top
researchers who say fetal tissue transplants hold potential for
treating diabetes, Alzheimer's and many other diseases, it was
clear the scientists and doctors were well aware of ethical
considerations.
   For example, there have been instances of women in the United
States expressing a desire to become pregnant just to produce a
fetus that would be aborted to treat a relative with Parkinson's
disease.
   ``There are rumors that this has been done in East Germany,''
said Thomas J. Gill III, chairman of the pathology department at
the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. ``I think this is
ethically unacceptable.''
   Olson made no claims of dramatic improvements for the two
patients he implanted with fetal brain cells eight months ago.
   ``There have been no adverse effects,'' he said. ``It appears
that we are seeing minor positive changes in the patients.''
   He pointed out that both patients, women in their 50s, have been
suffering from severe Parkinson's for 15 years and he was
optimistic that the marginal improvement seen so far will intensify
as the implanted brain cells mature.
   Parkinson's, which causes a loss of muscle control, is caused by
a shortage of cells that produce a brain chemical called dopamine.
It is these dopamine-producing cells that are transplanted from
fetuses.

   A gunman took 11 hostages at a military
recruiting station today but freed them unharmed hours later after
two radio stations agreed to air a statement asserting his goal was
``peace in Lebanon.''
   He surrendered moments later, shortly before 2 p.m. No one was
injured.
   The unidentified gunman, who had described himself as ``a local
person of Lebanese descent,'' was armed with an AK-47, an automatic
rifle that is standard issue in Communist countries, said police
Lt. C.M. Schesventer.
   Police negotiated by telephone with the man, who had claimed two
armed companions, but police learned from freed captives there was
only one gunman.
   The 11 captives _ nine military personnel and two civilians _
included a high school senior enlisting in the service, said
Schesventer.
   Hostages began coming out, alone and in twos, about every 10
minutes shortly after radio stations WRNL-AM and WRXL-FM twice
aired a message at the gunman's demand around noon, said Marianne
Jennings, news director at the stations.
   ``There is a hostage situation at Tuckernuck Square Shopping
Center,'' the statement read. ``There have been no injuries.
Negotiations are proceeding. The hostage-takers have so far been
cooperative. They're holding an undetermined number of people. The
hostage-takers' goal is peace in Lebanon.''
   The U.S. Armed Forces Recruiting Center is in a shopping center
that includes 30 stores. All were evacuated.
   Local and state police carrying automatic weapons ringed the
area. The shopping center is in a heavily developed commercial
strip.
   Sands said police received a call at 9:15 a.m. about a
hostage-taking at the recruiting center, which houses
representatives of several military branches.

<HEAD>Rice Industry Acts to Counter Japanese Import Curbs</HEAD>

   American rice farmers complained Wednesday
that their crops are being frozen out of the Japanese market and
asked for government help including trade retaliation if needed.
   ``The time has come for the government of Japan to take the
steps necessary for us to compete in our market,'' Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., told a news conference at which the action was
announced.
   Groups representing rice producers and millers asked U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton K. Yeutter for assistance on grounds that
Japanese refusal to permit rice imports amounts to an unfair trade
barrier.
   Yeutter has 45 days to decide whether to take the case. If he
did so, the next step would be to engage in talks with the Japanese.
   If that failed, the government would seek relief under the
97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Failure to
get results after two years of GATT negotiations would require
retaliation under the new trade law approved by Congress and signed
by President Reagan this summer.
   Japan is the American farmer's best customer. It bought more
than $5.5 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products last year and
is expected to account for $6.9 billion in purchases this year,
more than any other country.
   Many of these goods, such as corn, are not grown in quantity in
Japan. It has imported only a tiny trickle of rice, maintaining
restraints in an effort to protect its farmers from foreign
competition.
   California, Texas and other American producers, engaging in
high-tech, large-scale farming, can grow rice at far below the
costs of Japanese counterparts and, if all trade restraints were
swept away, could be expected to command a substantial share of the
Japanese market in short order.
   Industry officials said rice priced at $300 a ton in the United
States would cost $2,500 in Japan.
   They told the news conference, however, they have no intention
of trying to wipe out Japanese rice farming.
   ``We are not looking for an opportunity to flood the Japanese
market,'' said J. Stephen Gabbert, president of the Rice Millers
Association. The group filed the trade petition in a joint effort
with the Rice Council for Market Development, a growers group.
   The petition seeks to gain 2.5 percent of the Japanese rice
market in the first of a four-year phase-in and expand to 10
percent, or 1 million tons, by the fourth year.
   Senators from rice-producing states were on hand to push the
petition, with Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., declaring that the
industry had tried to get the Japanese to import American rice
voluntarily.
   ``As always the response has been a virtual stone wall,'' said
Wilson. ``And that is not good enough.''

   President Reagan, campaigning for his
vice president George Bush, blamed Democrats Wednesday for
``economic and foreign policy nightmares.''
   Reagan praised his own record in office during a speech prepared
for a campaign rally at Southeast Missouri State University, and he
envisioned a return to high inflation and other economic problems
as well as a loss of American prestige if the Democrats win in
November.
   ``America has traveled such a remarkable distance in the last
eight years that the memory has faded of the economic and foreign
policy crises that we faced when Vice President Bush and I took
office,'' he said in the latest in a series of out-of-town forays
Reagan will make to promote Bush and Republican candidates for
Congress.
   ``The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition's
memory lane, it starts to look like `Nightmare on Elm Street,''' he
said.
   Reagan, who won roughly 60 percent of the popular vote in
Missouri in his race against Democrat Walter F. Mondale, was
traveling later in the day to St. Louis to speak at a $250-a-plate
fund-raising dinner. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the expenses for the trip from Washington were being paid by the
state and national Republican parties.
   In his speech, Reagan brought back a familiar refrain _ that
Democratic Party leaders harbor gloom-and-doom views of America's
future in the world _ although he never mentioned the name of
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   He did say that in 1979, the nation was facing double-digit
inflation and interest rates at home while being faced with the
seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and the Soviet
incursion into Afghanistan.
   ``Don't we have the right to ask the American people: If the
liberals return to power, what happens in 1989?'' he asked.
   ``When the American people saw that under the other fellows, the
economic misery index was soaring off the charts, they wanted a
change, and who did they call? George Bush and me _ the
malaise-busters.''
   Fitzwater told reporters that during the flight from Washington
that the president decided not to use the ``malaise-busters''
phrase because ``he said he was just uncomfortable with the
language.''
   Reagan hailed the Commerce Department's report Wednesday that
the U.S. merchandise trade deficit fell in July to $9.5 billion,
the lowest level since December 1984.
   ``When America goes into the market to compete, we plan to
win,'' he said. ``Others may talk, but we deliver.''
   ``Today, we have peace and prosperity,'' Reagan said. ``And the
liberals are trying to pretend those economic and foreign policy
nightmares they gave us never happened.''
   Several state Republicans, including Gov. John Ashcroft, hoped
to benefit from Reagan's fund-raising appearances. Ashcroft is
seeking a second term against Democratic State Rep. Betty Hearnes
of Charleston, the wife of former Gov. William Hearnes.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., is opposed by State Sen. Jay Nixon of
Hillsboro as Danforth seeks his third term.

   that they are stifling competition in the air travel industry, a
congressional report said Wednesday.
   The study concluded that the reservation systems are generating
profits ``exceeding those that could reasonably be expected to be
earned in a competitive market.''
   It also chided the Department of Transportation for failing to
take steps to eliminate the ``anti-competitive features'' of the
computer reservation industry.
   ``DOT has a statutory responsibility to protect competition in
the airline industry,'' said the report, which was written by the
General Accounting Office, Congress' nonpartisan investigative
agency.
   The computer systems whic budget deficit, Brady praised both the
administration and Congress for their efforts, which have whittled
the deficit from $220 billion in 1986 to an estimated $150 billion
this year.
   ``I do think we can grow our way out of this,'' he said, adding
at another point, ``I see no reason at this moment why taxes have
to be raised.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., urged Brady to offer more than
``platitudes'' on the budget. Brady declined to recommend
specifics, but promised to present Congress with new ideas for
reducing the deficit by the end of the year.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the chairman of the Finance
Committee and the Democratic vice presidential candidate, gave
Brady a warm endorsement, even though Brady is a close adviser to
Bush.
   ``Nick Brady is a friend and former colleague and in my opinion
is a man who is well qualified to be treasury secretary,'' Bentsen
said. ``It's a big job, a tough job, but you're used to tough
jobs.''
   In his latest government assignment, Brady headed a presidential
task force that studied the causes of the October stock market
crash. His report called for greater regulation over some aspects
of the markets and was met with a cold shoulder by the
administration.
   Brady said market reforms put in place since the crash have been
``on the right track,'' declining to criticize the administration
for not doing everything his commission advised.
   ``I'm not sure we were 100 percent right. We did our work in 60
days,'' he said.
   On another matter, Brady said federal savings and loan
regulators have as much as they can spend for now on S&L rescues
and he said he saw no reason, for now, for a taxpayer bailout of
the industry.
   Brady's great-grandfather founded electric utilities that later
became part of Consolidated Edison Co., and his grandfather started
a precursor of Dodge Motor Co., now a division of Chrysler Corp.
The family also founded Purolator Co.
   Brady, 58, is co-chairman of Dillon Read & Co., an old-line Wall
Street investment firm, which he joined in 1954 after receiving a
master's degree in business from Harvard University.
   In 1982, he represented New Jersey for eight months in the
Senate by appointment, filling the seat of Democrat Harrison A.
Williams Jr., who had resigned following his conviction in the
Abscam influence-peddling scandal.

<HEAD>Steering Problems Suspected In United Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Airlines DC-10 that skidded off a runway
at Stapleton International Airport may have experienced steering
problems before the accident occurred, a federal aviation official
said.
   One person out of the 207 aboard suffered minor injuries in
Monday's mishap.
   The pilot ``had some problems with the steering, he went off the
runway, and they evacuated,'' said Bob Shelton, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration's regional office in Denver.
   ``They did have some steering problems. ... The nose tire did
show some chafing, which meant it was sliding, which usually
indicates a steering problem, like you're dragging it sideways
across the pavement,'' he said.
   Pilots who witnessed the incident said the pilot apparently
overshot the runway landing area, touching down 4,000 to 5,000 feet
from the start of the runway, instead of within the 3,000 feet
required by FAA regulations.
   Federal records also showed that the plane had problems with its
landing gear three times this summer.
   Tracks left by the jetliner's tires indicate that it veered from
the rain-wet runway on a high-speed taxiway about 1,000 feet down
from the touchdown point.
   After it landed, the plane traveled nearly 2,000 feet on grass
and dirt beside the 10,000-foot-long runway and bumped over two
taxiway crossings. Its nose landing gear collapsed near a third
taxiway crossing, said Stapleton spokesman Norm Avery.
   Loren Steiner, president of Golden Eagle Charter and a licensed
air transport pilot, watched the plane touch down from his office
near the runway.
   The pilot, he said, ``was at the normal altitude and speed (for
landing) but he was too far down the runway. There was a lot of
black smoke and debris flying; it may be that he blew a tire then.''
   In two previous incidents involving the landing gear, crews
flying the plane reported that nose-wheel warning lights went off
as the aircraft was preparing to land, the FAA said. On a third
occasion, warning lights for all three of the plane's landing gear
illuminated as the aircraft took off.
   In each instance, the problem was corrected, and no accident
occurred, the FAA reported.
   Although the cause of the accident is still under investigation,
United Airlines spokesman Joe Hopkins said the airline concluded
the type of problems reported on the landing gear earlier could not
have been a factor.

<HEAD>Hearing Set Friday On Motions In DeSillers Estate Flap</HEAD>

   The savings and loan where Maria DeSillers kept
some donations for her son's medical care should have frozen the
funds after the boy died, the estate's curator contends in court
documents.
   Nearly $690,000, including $1,000 from President Reagan, was
donated to pay for liver transplants for 7-year-old Ronnie, who
died in April 1987 while awaiting his fourth liver transplant at
Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital.
   After his death, Coral Gables Federal Savings and Loan did not
block Ms. DeSillers from withdrawing of some $200,000, which
legally belonged to the boy's estate, curator Karen Gievers alleged
in motions filed Tuesday with Dade County Probate Court.
   ``With the widespread national media attention that Ronnie got,
the (savings and loan) should have realized that he had died,'' Ms.
Gievers said.
   Ms. Gievers said her motions asked for court permission to bring
a lawsuit against the savings and loan over the issue. A hearing
was scheduled Friday before Probate Judge Francis Christie.
   Karl Steene, director of marketing for Coral Gables Federal,
declined to comment Tuesday.
   Ms. DeSillers and her attorney, Frank Johnson, did not return
phone messages seeking comment. In the past, the have contended
that she had the right to the money because some of the donations
were intended just for her personal expenses.
   The money withdrawn by Ms. DeSillers was used to buy a used BMW
for $13,500, jewelry, clothing and other items. Christie signed a
court order last month authorizing the seizure of disputed
property. The car was seized, but the other items have not yet been
taken.
   Money used to buy the car, and the value of other property and
assets recovered during the ongoing legal battle, will be deducted
from the amount Ms. Gievers hopes to obtain from Coral Gables
Federal.
   If Coral Gables Federal is forced to pay the difference to
Ronnie's estate, the savings and loan could in turn sue Ms.
DeSillers, the curator said.

<TEXT>
   A ransom of $22.2 million may have
been paid to release a West German hostage despite a round of
denials from his employer and government officials, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   The Hamburg-based mass-cirulation daily Bild said the money was
deposited into Arabian bank accounts to secure the freedom of
Rudolf Cordes, who arrived home Tuesday night after 20 months of
captivity.
   Cordes, 55, Beirut manager for the Hoechst AG pharmaceutical
company, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers
late Monday night. He was first taken to Damascus, Syria.
   Wolfgang Schaeuble, who heads the federal government's Middle
East crisis group, strongly denied that money was paid for Cordes'
release.
   ``There were no deals. There were no conditions,'' said
Schaeuble.
   ``The release was secured through talks and the help of Iranian
and Syrian officials,'' he said, echoing earlier comments by
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Schaeuble also said the government made no concessions in the
case of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who is on trial in Frankfurt on
charges of murder and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA
jetliner.
   Justice Minister Hans Engelhard also said the government ``from
the first moment on made it clear that there would be no deals, no
release in exchange for the West German hostages.''
   Cordes and another West German, Alfred Schmidt, were kidnapped
in Beirut in January 1987 after Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt
Airport.
   Schmidt was released on Sept. 7, 1987.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, was convicted by a Duesseldorf
court for his role in the kidnappings, which were designed to
pressure the government into releasing Mohammed Hamadi.
   But Bild, citing unidentified security sources, strongly
suggested a ransom was paid.
   ``Despite all denials by the West German government and the
Hoechst company, a sum of millions is believed to have been paid to
kidnappers for the release,'' Bild said.
   The newspaper quoted a source identified only as a ``security
expert'' as saying that millions of dollars were paid for Cordes'
release.
   ``Such money is paid discreetly via front men into Arabian bank
accounts,'' Bild quoted a ``security expert'' as saying. ``In
Cordes' case there has been talk of at least 40 million marks
($22.2 million).''
   The newspaper is known to have good sources within the
government in Bonn.
   The Frankfurt-based Hoechst company also denied that any money
was paid and declared as false a magazine report that it had hired
a private detective to deliver the money.
   Hoechst spokeswoman Felicitas Feick said: ``Our company had
nothing to do with this man. No money was paid for Mr. Cordes'
release.''
   The Hamburg-based Stern magazine, in a telex to news media, said
a man it identified as Werner Mauss was hired by the company to
conduct negotiations and deliver money to the hijackers.
   After his arrival at Cologne-Bonn airport Tuesday, Cordes was
immediately flown to an undisclosed location. He remained in
seclusion Wednesday.
   Schaeuble told West German television that Cordes was ``weak but
in good health.'' He said Cordes told him that he was kept isolated
and chained during most of his captivity.
   ``He was moved often and was in a continuous state of
uncertainty. He told me he received few letters from his
relatives,'' Schaeuble said.
   Cordes was the last West German hostage in Lebanon, where 17
other foreigners are held captive. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting Treasury Secretary M. Peter McPherson
spoke out strongly Wednesday for ending Third World trade
concessions that he said perpetuate poverty instead of promoting
growth.
   ``Less developed countries can gain much more by negotiating as
true trade partners ... than as special pleaders'' in trade talks,
he said in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute, a
business and public policy research organization.
   McPherson attacked the reliance of developing countries on
waivers of international trade rules allowing them to use ``import
substitution'' and non-reciprocity policies to protect infant
industries.
   He said that during the current Uruguay round of world trade
negotiations, the United States will step up opposition to
``special and differential treatment'' for such countries under the
rules of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The Uruguay round, launched at the 1986 world economic
conference at Punta del Este, Uruguay, is scheduled for a review
session in December at Montreal.
   Import substitution amounts to protection and ``the old theory
that trade protection promotes development is bankrupt, yet GATT
still echoes this theory,'' McPherson said.
   The accumulation of ``special exemptions and arrangements for
developing countries through GATT's history has effectively removed
less developed countries from obligations under GATT principles of
nondiscrimination, transparency and reciprocity,'' he asserted.
   A 1955 GATT decision allowing poor countries with balance of
payments (BOP) problems to restrict imports temporarily has been
misused to the point that ``the BOP waiver is used to provide
lasting cover for import substitution policies,'' he said. ``Some
of those quotas have been in place for decades.''
   ``Rather than a strategy for economic development, import
substitution is a strategy for economic decline,'' McPherson
asserted. He said the concessions promote inward-looking policies
that reduce export capacity, worsen balance of payments and income
distribution and depress wages.
   Not only the free trade city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong
but also Turkey and Mexico are examples of economies that have
prospered under outward-oriented trade policies, McPherson said.
   After it ``reversed course and began to liberalize trade'' in
1980, Turkey's annual rises in export growth jumped from 5.5
percent to almost 20 per cent, he said. ``No economy, not even
Taiwan has performed better.'' Turkish manufactured goods, 2
percent of exports in 1965, account for 56 percent today, he said.

<HEAD>Jimmy Swaggart's TV Rating Drops Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart's television
audience has dropped sharply over the last year following a sex
scandal and his dismissal from the Assemblies of God, according to
the Arbitron rating service.
   Swaggart's weekly television program dropped from the top-rated
religious telecast in July 1987 to No. 3 in July 1988, with only
half the previous audience, Arbitron found.
   His daily program dropped from 11th to 17th during the same
period, according to Arbitron, which measures viewership on
commercial television stations.
   The latest figures show his weekly program was viewed by 836,000
households at least once during an average week between July 6 and
Aug. 2, down from 1.68 million households a year ago.
   Swaggart was dismissed in May from the Assemblies of God, the
nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, after refusing to submit
to a one-year suspension from the pulpit for a reported involvement
with a New Orleans-area prostitute.
   The top-rated religious program, with host Robert Schuller, was
seen in 1.12 million households this summer, while the No. 2 show,
``The World Tomorrow,'' was seen by 1.19 million households.
   The number of television markets carrying Swaggart fell from 192
to 184 during the year.
   Television evangelist Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral
Majority, was rated No. 5 a year ago and fell to No. 10. His
viewership fell from 582,000 households in July 1987 to 284,000
this year, or a loss of about 48 percent.
   Falwell fell from 171 markets in the past year to 129, according
to Arbitron.
   Evangelist Oral Roberts has lost about 35 percent of his
audience, according to Arbitron figures. The July 1988 report
showed Roberts in the No. 4 spot with 561,000 households, down from
863,000 in July 1987. Roberts was in 121 markets this year as
compared to 179 last year.

   A military judge Wednesday denied a
defense motion to dismiss all charges against a Navy rescue-swimmer
instructor standing court-martial for the drowning of a teen-age
recruit.
   Cmdr. Newell D. Krogmann gave no explanation for his ruling in
the case of Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, accused of
involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery
in the death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki.
   The 19-year-old trainee from Appleton, Wis., drown March 2 in a
training pool at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   Marine Capt. James Royce, one of the lawyers for the 28-year-old
defendant from Tempe, Ariz., contended the prosecution, which
rested Tuesday, had presented insufficient evidence to prove his
client's guilt.
   Combe helped other instructors toss Mirecki back into the pool
after the panicked recruit climbed out and tried to quit the
voluntary training, and then forced the victim's head under water,
prosecution witnesses have testified.
   Royce argued that Combe and other instructors adhered to what
they considered normal procedures in dealing with an unwilling
trainee.
   ``You cannot have a conspiracy to commit what you believe to be
a lawful act,'' Royce said.
   But the lead prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. Larry Wynne, argued the
instructors' actions were illegal.
   On the involuntary manslaughter charge, Royce contended there
was no culpable negligence because Combe didn't know Mirecki had a
phobia about being dragged under water and couldn't have
anticipated it would cause him to have a heart attack. A Navy
pathologist testified the phobia triggered fear-induced heart
failure that led to his drowning.
   Combe should have expected the possibility of death resulting
from his actions because another recruit had passed out from
similar treatment at Combe's hands last year, Wynne said.
   Royce also argued that evidence failed to show Mirecki was
touched against his will, a necessary finding for a battery
conviction.
   Witnesses had testified Mirecki shouted he wanted to quit and
was trying to get away before Combe grabbed him in a head hold and
dunked him.

   The Pentagon has agreed to dispatch
active-duty military personnel and equipment from at least one base
in Texas to assist with evacuations along the Texas coast as
Hurricane Gilbert moves closer to the United States, Sen. Phil
Gramm said Wednesday.
   He said the Army was setting up a ``crisis action center'' in
Washington to coordinate the effort, and that active duty personnel
and equipment would be called up from Fort Hood in Killeen and
possibly Fort Bliss in El Paso.
   Trucks, helicopters and bulldozers and an undetermined number of
military personnel will be sent to the coast to assist the Texas
National Guard with the evacuations, said Gramm, R-Texas.
   ``They're willing to commit whatever is needed to get the job
done,'' Gramm said, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration labeled Hurricane Gilbert the strongest hurricane
ever in the Western Hemisphere.
   ``I'm pleased we're getting organized,'' Gramm said. ``If it
turns out to be disaster it has the potential to be, an early
coordination effort could be the difference betwen saving lives and
not.''
   Gramm also announced Wednesday that the Army Corps of Engineers
had opened an emergency office in Galveston to handle flood control
and emergency construction along the coast.
   ``This puts a lot of resources at our command,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said he had also been talking with officials from the
Housing and Urban Development Department, the Small Business
Administration, the Farmers Home Administration, the General
Services Administration and the Federal Emergency Management
Administration about emergency shelter and communications needs.
   ``We asked each to go ahead and begin their preparations,''
Gramm said. ``The idea is the better organized we are in advance of
the potential dangers of the hurricane, the less we will have in
terms of property damage and personal injury.''

<NOTE>Eds: Includes highlights of Tuesday's other primary results.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Primary victors Herbert Kohl and state Sen.
Susan Engeleiter launched a campaign Wednesday for the seat of
retiring Sen. William Proxmire that promises to be the most
expensive race in Wisconsin history.
   ``It's going to be like `Brewster's Millions,''' said Michael
Grebe, a Republican national committeeman, referring to the Richard
Pryor movie in which a man must give away a large amount of money
in a short time.
   Kohl, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, defeated
former Gov. Anthony S. Earl and three other Democratic candidates
Tuesday after spending $2.1 million, most of it on TV ads. He had
raised $3.6 million for the primary, $3.2 million of it his own
money.
   In the general election, Kohl ``will spend enough to get his
message across, just as he did in the primary,'' said his
spokesman, Steve McKay.
   Kohl credited his ``Nobody's Senator but Yours'' slogan for his
victory and said the vote showed people wanted ``a qualified
non-politician with real business world experience.''
   Engeleiter, the only woman nominated by either party for a
Senate seat this year, spent $1.2 million to defeat Stephen B.
King, former state party chairman, in the GOP primary.
   She said she expects to spend $3.5 million in the general
election, a shade over the state record of $3.4 million spent by
Sen. Robert Kasten in his re-election campaign in 1986.
   Yet Engeleiter plans to make an issue of Kohl's wealth,
according to campaign manager Jill Hanson, by portraying the choice
as between a 36-year-old mother of two and a bachelor millionaire.
   The talk of big money was noted with regret by Proxmire, who
reported spending just $145.10 on is last campaign in 1982.
   ``People are allowed spend that kind of money,'' he said. ``They
do it in every state. I think it's a shame. It's too bad.''
   But Proxmire, who endorsed Earl in television commericials
before the primary, was quick to support Kohl, saying he will
``make a very strong and fine Democratic candidate and an
outstanding U.S. senator.''
   With 99 percent of the votes counted, Kohl had 248,092 votes or
47 percent, to Earl's 203,195, or 38 percent. Former deputy
attorney general Edward R. Garvey had 55,083 votes or 10 percent,
Secretary of State Douglas La Follette had 20,145 votes or 4
percent, and Edmond Hou-Seye, a Sheboygan tire dealer, had 5,147
votes or 1 percent.
   Engeleiter swamped King 209,973 to 148,345 votes, or 57 percent
to 40 percent. Peter Taylor, of Milwaukee, had 9,260 votes, or 3
percent.
   Here are highlights of other primary voting Tuesday:
   VERMONT _ Republican Rep. James Jeffords defeated conservative
Michael Griffes in a Senate primary. Jeffords will face Democrat
William Gray, a former U.S. attorney, for the seat of retiring GOP
Sen. Robert Stafford.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Rep. Judd Gregg, son of a former governor,
defeated two challengers for the GOP nomination for governor. He
will face Democrat Paul McEeachern for the job being given up by
Gov. John Sununu.
   ARIZONA _ Seven Republican legislators who voted to impeach or
convict Gov. Evan Mecham last spring lost in primaries to his
ultra-conservative backers.
   MINNESOTA _ Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger won the nomination
for a third term and Attorney General Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey
III won the Democratic nomination to oppose him.

   Novelist Walker Percy, called ``a
spiritual beacon for a whole generation of readers,'' became the
first American author Wednesday to win the T.S. Eliot Award for
Creative Writing.
   Percy and sociologist Edward Shils, who won the Ingersoll
Foundation's Richard M. Weaver Award for Scholarly Letters,
captured the 1988 Ingersoll Prizes.
   Percy, 72, of Covington, La., and Shils, 78, of Chicago, were
honored because their works ``affirm the moral principles of
Western civilization,'' the foundation said in a statement.
   Each will receive $15,000.
   Since the foundation created its prizes in 1983, all the T.S.
Eliot Award winners have been European or Latin American.
   ``Percy is among a very small handful of first-rate novelists
that have appeared in America since World War I,'' said Thomas
Fleming, executive secretary of the awards. His best-known books
are ``The Thanatos Syndrome,'' ``The Second Coming'' and ``The
Moviegoer.''
   Shils started his career as a research and teaching assistant at
the University of Chicago, where he now is a professor.
   Shils and Talcott Parsons, another prominent sociologist,
co-edited ``Toward a General Theory of Action,'' an influential
book in the field. Shils' other works include ``The Torment of
Secrecy'' and ``The Academic Ethic.''

   LeVar Burton, who plays a crew member in
``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' is seeking an apology from
state narcotics agents who detained him briefly.
   The agents stopped him for a few minutes in this town near San
Jose as part of a check of people that matched a police ``profile''
of drug couriers from Southern California.
   Burton, who was en route to Ventana with his girlfriend and had
gotten out of his car to add oil when agents approached, said he
asked what was happening but an agent told him, ``It's none of your
business.''
   A spokesman for the Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement said
Wednesday agents were not available for comment.
   State narcotics officials confirmed that black and Hispanic men
aged 18 to 30 are being stopped by the state Bureau of Narcotics
Enforcement because they fit the profile of Los Angeles drug
members, who are believed to be trying to export their drug trade.
   Burton said he hasn't decided whether he will pursue the matter
legally.

   Boxing champ Mike Tyson's image has taken some
lumps outside the ring in the past few weeks, and it may wallop his
wallet.
   Some consultants say Tyson's problems may make advertisers leery
of signing him up.
   ``Nobody wants to lose the customers they already have, and all
the negative stuff with him is a way to lose customers,'' said
Lloyd Kolmer, who heads a firm that advises advertisers on signing
celebrities for commercials.
   Since dispatching Michael Spinks in a 91-second bout for the
heavyweight championship in June, Tyson has gone through a court
battle with his manager, engaged in a street fight with a former
opponent and survived a car crash that one newspaper reported _ and
Tyson denied _ was a suicide attempt.
   Bill Cayton, Tyson's manager, has delayed talks with a battery
maker and an electronics company about having Tyson appear in
commercials for them. He refused to identify the companies.
   ``It's not the best negotiating atmosphere,'' he said.

   Former Beatle Paul McCartney would like to visit
the Soviet Union, but his business agent says Soviet fans will have
only his records to listen to for a while.
   ``At the present time, plans for a trip ... are not
materializing. We hope that Soviet fans of his work will be
compensated by listening to his album `Back in the USSR,' said
Bernard Doherty.
   McCartney said in an interview published Wednesday in the youth
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that a tour would come after the
release of an album of his in the Soviet Union. A McCartney
spokesman says while talks haven't begun, a Soviet concert is
possible next year.
   The album, which consists of 13 rock 'n' rock songs, is to be
released next month. McCartney says the album is a ``gesture of
good will to the Soviet people.''

<HEAD>House Approves $8.8 Billion Measure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted 386-26 approval Wednesday of a
bill appropriating $8.8 billion for military construction projects
in the year beginning Oct. 1.
   It approved a compromise House-Senate version of the legislation
and sent it to the Senate for final congressional consideration.
   The compromise is an increase from the $8.3 billion construction
budget for the current fiscal year but is below the $9.7 billion
sought by President Reagan.
   The measure includes $65 million for the final stage of
construction of a national test facility in Colorado for Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as Star Wars. The $100
million project will be used to test SDI components.
   The bill doesn't contain money for construction of a
railroad-based version of the MX nuclear-tipped missile. Reagan
sought $31 million. Congress decided to leave the decision on the
future of the rail-based MX weapon up to the next administration.
   The measure provides $173 million for construction projects as
part of the Navy's new home porting program, which involves
building new bases around the nation's coasts. The Navy sought $191
million for the program.
   The bill also has $50 million to build a closed incinerator at
Tooele Army Depot in Utah to destroy obsolete and aging chemical
weapons. The Army is building new chemical weapons.

   The outcome of the shootout was not immediately known, but at

Tuesday night.
   The shooting broke out about 20 minutes after the pope arrived
in Maseru, eight hours behind schedule. The hijackers earlier had
demanded to meet with the pope and Lesotho's king, Moshoeshoe II, a
government official said.
   The gunfire was heard at the site where the bus was parked, and
flares lit up the sky. Reporters were blocked from getting close
enough to determine what was happening but saw at least one nun
among the bloodied people taken away.
   Police ordered journalists at the scene to disperse and then

   A woman accused of setting up housekeeping
in David Letterman's home while he was away, taking the talk show
host's Porsche for a spin and posing as his wife was placed on two
years' probation today.
   Margaret Ray, 36, of no certain address, was granted accelerated
rehabilitation on charges of burglary and auto theft. The form of
probation is available to first-time offenders and does not require
the defendant to enter a plea.
   If the defendant completes probation, the charges are stricken
from his or her record.
   Superior Court Judge Edward Leavitt ordered Ray to remain a
psychiatric patient at Fairfield Hills Hospital in Newtown and have
no personal contact with Letterman. Ray was twice found incompetent
to stand trial on the charges.
   ``It's good news,'' she said after sentencing.
   Ray was taken into custody in May after she was stopped at the
New Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel to New York City driving
Letterman's sports car, police said.
   Ray, whose 3-year-old son was in the car, didn't have any money
and allegedly told the toll collector, ``I'm Mrs. David Letterman
and this is David Jr. Don't you think David Letterman is good for
the toll?''
   Police said she had broken into and set up housekeeping in
Letterman's New Canaan home several days earlier.
   Letterman's attorneys had sent a letter to the court agreeing to
accelerated rehabilitation, said Assistant States Attorney Robert
Hall. The letter was not made public.
   Authorities initially decided not to press charges at
Letterman's request. But Ray returned to the talk show host's house
soon after being released in New Jersey and was arrested by New
Canaan police, authorities said.
   In August, a judge said Ray was at last competent to stand trial.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Libya Able To Produce Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday it has
evidence that Libya has acquired a chemical weapons production
capability and is on the verge of a full-scale production effort.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman called this ``a particularly
worrisome development'' in light of Libya's record of
state-sponsored terrorism in many global troublespots.
   He said the kinds of chemicals that are useful in producing
chemical weapons are available on the world market. He called on
nations that may be making contributions to the Libyan program to
halt such activity.
   Redman said the United States has been investigating the matter
for some time but substantiated the alleged Libyan activities only
recently. He provided no information on type of weapons Libya is
developing nor did he say how U.S. officials learned of the
operations.
   His statement came less than a week after he accused Iraq of
using chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels in defiance of a 1925
international protocol barring use of such weapons.
   He said Wednesday that the use of chemical weapons by both Iran
and Iraq had set a ``dangerous precedent'' for the Middle East as a
whole.
   Redman noted that there were reports last year that Libya had
used chemical weapons in its war with Chad.
   ``We also have the general record of irresponsible behavior on
the part of (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi,'' he said. ``I think
in the end this is yet another indication of why the world
community needs to take vigorous action to curb the illicit use of
chemical weapons and their further proliferation,'' he added.

   The government said Wednesday
that three anti-apartheid leaders holed up in the U.S. Consulate
after escaping detention are free men and will not be rearrested.
   But the lawyer for the trio, who were jailed up to 21 months
without trial, said he received no official word of the
government's stance and gave no indication what his clients planned
to do.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the three were ``not in any
danger of being arrested once they leave the consulate.'' Police
said they would have to issue new orders to detain the men again
but that they have no plans to do so.
   The activists slipped away from their police guards Tuesday
while undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital and made their way to
the consulate in a downtown office building.
   ``We sought refuge in the U.S. Consulate because we failed to
see any justification for our continued detention without trial,''
the three said in the statement. ``We have now resorted to the only
dignified response to our continued incarceration.''
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe, acting publicity secretary of
the banned United Democratic Front, Mohammed Valli Moosa, the
front's acting general secretary, and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of
the banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   Morobe, detained without trial since July 1987, and Khanyile,
detained since December 1986, are black. Valli Moosa, an Indian,
was arrested with Morobe.
   The trio, in a statement released by their lawyer, Krish Naidoo,
called for an end to the 27-month state of emergency and demanded
``the right to walk out of this consulate free of any restrictions,
or the threat of redetention.''
   Naidoo said his clients had not received word of the
government's offer. He said he did not know how the activists would
respond if they received a formal offer of unconditional freedom.
   Naidoo, who met with the men Wednesday, said they gave no
indication that they want to leave South Africa.
   The trio, who also met with family members, were staying in one
small room, but they had a television, videocassette recorder and
their own beds, Naidoo said.
   The Rev. Beyers Naude, a white anti-apartheid activist who also
met the detainees, said, ``Their state of mind is positive and they
are in good spirits.''
   U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins met for an hour Tuesday night
with Naidoo and other members of a committee representing the
activists.
   Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
conferred with the Rev. Frank Chikane, the black general secretary
of the South African Council of Churches; Jay Naidoo, an Indian
anti-apartheid labor leader; and Max Coleman, a white opponent of
detention without trial.
   Chikane said Perkins promised that the activists' material needs
would be met while they were in the consulate.
   U.S. officials have said the activists would not be forced to
leave their sanctuary against their will despite a worldwide U.S.
policy of not formally granting asylum in diplomatic offices.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman said the embassy remained in contact with
the South African government about the situation.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the emergency, which the white-led
government declared to control widespread black protests.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Thanks U.S. For Paying Dues, But Says Fiscal Problem
Still Acute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
thanked the United States on Wednesday for pledging to pay hundreds
of millions of dollars in back dues, but he said the world body
still faces long-term fiscal problems.
   President Reagan announced Tuesday he is releasing $188 million
in dues for the current and next fiscal year.
   The White House told the State Department to work out a
``multiyear'' plan to repay $520 million more in all overdue
assessments to the U.N. budget and to the World Health Organization
and Food and Agriculture Organization.
   Assistant Secretary of State John Whitehead and Herbert S. Okun,
the second-ranking diplomat at the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations, will give the secretary-general a check for $15 million
Wednesday afternoon as a first payment, said U.S. Mission
spokeswoman Anne Stoddard.
   ``Of course, it has been a tremendous relief for me,'' Perez de
Cuellar said in an interview.
   ``We consider that it was a very positive development. I am
grateful for the understanding of the president and his staff. .. .
But it is important to understand that we are not completely off
the hook,'' said the secretary-general.
   When asked if the long efforts to persuade the United States to
pay its dues sapped the time of his staff and detracted from the
U.N.'s peacekeeping activities, Perez de Cuellar replied: ``All our
activities have a price.''
   The United States had withheld part of its dues to pressure the
United Nations to trim its budget, cut the staff by 15 percent and
adopt personnel reforms. The White House now says it is satisfied
with the U.N.'s progress in implementing the reforms.
   There are 102 delinquent nations owing the regular U.N. budget
$602 million. The outstanding delinquents are the United States at
$467 million, South Africa $33.9 million, Brazil $17.9 million,
Iran $12.1 million, the Soviet Union $9.8 million, Argentina $6.2
million, Mexico $6.2 million, Israel $4.7 million, Poland $4.3
million and Romania $4 million.
   In addition, the United States is about $70 million behind in
assessed dues to the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon and the
Golan Heights.
   The United Nations has a reserve budget of about $200 million to
be used as seed money to start up peacekeeping operations and for
other sudden commitments, but the organization had to dip into the
fund to meet operating expenses.
   That fund would have been exhausted by the end of October
without an infusion of money from the United States, leaving the
United Nations unable to meet its payroll, rents and other fixed
operating costs.
   A U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
U.S. pledge to repay its dues may enable the United Nations to
borrow money from nations that had been reluctant to help take up
the slack caused by the United States.
   Building up the reserve fund is now a top priority because of
the possibility that a U.N. peacekeeping force of over 7,000 may be
sent to Namibia after Nov. 1 to monitor that South African-ruled
territory's transition to independence.
   The Namibia operation may cost $600 million to $700 million, he
said, far outstripping the $200 million reserve fund _ which is
already near depletion.
   Other potentially costly U.N. peacekeeping plans in the works
are a referendum in Western Sahara on independence or affiliation
with Morocco, and a plan for a political settlement in Cambodia.
   Both settlements would require thousands of U.N. peacekeepers
and election monitors.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Down, Reflecting Trend to Buy American</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit showed the
biggest improvement in almost six years in July, a dramatic 28
percent narrowing that reflected a big decline in Americans'
appetite for foreign goods, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said the difference between what the
United States imports and what it sells abroad shrank to $9.53
billion in July, down $3.6 billion from a June deficit of $13.22
billion.
   The Reagan administration lost no time hailing the huge decline
as proof that the administration's economic strategy of fighting
soaring trade deficits with a devaluation of the dollar was paying
off.
   In a speech in Cape Girardeau, Mo., President Reagan called the
trade figures ``very good'' news that proved that ``when America
goes into the market to compete, we play to win.''
   The 28 percent June-to-July decrease was the biggest monthly
improvement since a 35.7 percent narrowing in September 1982 and
gave the country the lowest overall imbalance since December 1984,
when the deficit was $8 billion.
   While the trade deficit has been showing improvement for most of
this year, the gains have all been on the export side, reflecting
the fact that the weaker dollar has made American products
competitive once again on overseas markets.
   Imports, however, had remained at stubbornly high levels.
Analysts said this made the July drop particularly encouraging.
   ``The big story is the tremendous improvement in imports,
suggesting that Americans might finally be beginning to buy more
American,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   ``Imports are declining because we have finally found a price
high enough to stop consumers from buying imported goods,'' said
Jay Goldinger, an economist with Capital Insight, a Los Angeles
investment firm.
   But other economists cautioned that it was far too early to
determine whether the import drop was the beginning of a long-term
trend. They noted that the decline to $35.99 billion was down from
a record high level of $39.50 billion in June.
   ``I don't think we have reached some kind of watershed where all
of a sudden consumers have decided they no longer want to buy
foreign goods,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources
Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   The July deficit was substantially better than economists had
expected. The government did, however, boost the June deficit to
$13.2 billion from the originally reported $12.5 billion.
   For the first seven months of this year, the U.S. trade deficit
has been running at an annual average of $137.5 billion, down 19.3
percent from the record $170.3 billion deficit suffered in 1987.
   This improvement has contributed more than half of total
economic growth this year and economists expected further economic
momentum from the trade performance in the second half of the year,
good news for Republican George Bush's presidential chances.
   In a second report Wednesday, the government said that
industrial output rose a moderate 0.2 percent in August, pushing
production up a healthy 5.3 percent over a year ago. Much of this
gain reflects the boom in export sales that American companies have
enjoyed.
   In July, exports climbed 0.7 percent to $26.5 billion, the fifth
straight month they have exceeded $25 billion. The July improvement
came from a variety of areas, led by a $600 million rise in sales
of U.S. manufactured products.
   The big drop in imports came primarily in capital goods for
businesses, which fell by $1.2 billion to $8 billion. This category
had risen sharply the previous month as U.S. companies had looked
abroad for the equipment needed to expand their own production
facilities.
   Also dropping sharply in July were car imports, which fell by
$803 million with almost all of that decline coming from a drop in
shipments of cars from Canada.
   Financial markets, which over the past year have been thrown
into a tailspin by unexpectedly bad monthly trade figures, gave a
generally lukewarm response to the good news Thursday. Stock and
bond prices and the dollar all posted modest gains.
   As usual, the country suffered its biggest deficit with Japan, a
$4.4 billion imbalance, which was unchanged from June. The deficit
with Western Europe rose to $2.3 billion from $1.9 billion in June.
The deficits with Taiwan and Canada were unchanged at $1.2 billion
and $1.1 billion, respectively.
   With the release of Wednesday's report, the government resumed a
practice abandoned in 1979 of simultaneously reporting the import
figures with the cost of shipping and insurance removed.
   Using this system, the deficit for July would have been an even
lower $8.07 billion, down from a June imbalance, minus shipping and
insurance, of $11.7 billion.

   Hispanics hold a record 3,360 elected offices
across the country, most of them at the local level, the director
of an organization that tracks Hispanic officials said Wednesday.
   The House of Representatives has 11 Hispanic members and the
Senate has none, but Harry Pachon, national director of the
National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials,
said big gains are possible in 1992 when congressional districts
are reapportioned based on the 1990 census.
   Although Hispanics make up 19.4 million, or 8 percent, of the
country's population, they hold fewer than 1 percent of the 490,000
elected offices nationwide, Pachon told a Capitol Hill news
conference.
   Pachon, however, called the gains made by Hispanics into elected
positions ``dramatic progress. It's not just rhetoric, it's an
increasing reality.''
   The number of Hispanics holding office increased 1.3 percent
this year, less than the 4.2 percent increase logged in 1987. But
that increase reflected the 1986 elections, while this year's
figures largely reflect local elections held between August 1987
and this past August, Pachon said.
   At the same time, the number of Hispanic women elected to office
increased by 5.7 percent this year, to 626 or 18.6 percent of the
total.
   Pachon said most of the elected Hispanics are Democrats, except
in Florida, where most are Republican.
   The association said the largest gains were made in the
Southwest, with Texas accounting for a record-high 1,611 Hispanic
officials. Texas has the nation's second largest Hispanic
population, estimated by the Census Bureau at 4.1 million or 23.1
percent of the estimated nationwide total.
   New Mexico had the second-highest total with 595 Hispanic
officials. Overall, the state has 543,000 Hispanics, or 2.8 percent
of the national total.
   California has the largest Hispanic population in the country _
6.6 million or 33.9 percent of the nationwide Hispanic population _
and 466 hold elective office.
   ``With 6 million Hispanics in California, you think there would
be a half dozen (in Congress),'' instead of the current four, said
Rep. Albert Bustamante, a San Antonio Democrat and chairman of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
   Many California Hispanics, however, are not eligible to vote,
Bustamante said, adding that the situation would change in the 21st
century when their children can vote.
   ``All of these kids are going to vote and there is going to be a
tremendous upsurge. The 21st century will make a tremendous
difference,'' Bustamante said.
   New York, with a Hispanic population of 2.1 million, or 11
percent, had 68 elected Latino leaders, the report said, fewer than
states with smaller Hispanic populations like Arizona, with 237
elected of officials, and Colorado with 157.
   The report said Hispanics hold one governorship, Bob Martinez of
Florida, and there are 229 Hispanic mayors, 120 state legislators,
319 county office holders, 1,106 municipal officials and 1,226
school board members.
   Other states with double-digit numbers of elected Hispanics were
Florida, 50, New Jersey, 44, Illinois, 28, Connecticut, 15, and
Washington, 12.

<HEAD>Koop Advocates Hospice Care For AIDS Patients</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terminally ill AIDS patients should be
treated in low-cost hospices rather than expensive hospitals,
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said Wednesday.
   Interviewed after an address to the 1,500 employees of
Independence Blue Cross, Koop said a move toward more hospice care
would have to come from a public-private partnership between
governments and private insurers.
   ``The public and private sectors have to get together. ... A
frank discussion of what AIDS will cost, how insurance fits in, and
the terminally ill needing a place to stay,'' he said.
   Thirty hospitals in the Philadelphia area recently reported a
$1.6 million yearly loss from treating AIDS patients. Asked if
hospitals were being shortchanged, Koop said there is a need to
move patients from a high-technology setting to hospice care to
save costs during the final stages of the disease.
   Hospices are homelike facilities that provide support for
terminally ill patients. Medical care stresses relief of pain
rather than efforts to prolong life.
   Koop said the stigma attached to AIDS has caused financial
problems for hospitals partly because some patients, fearful others
might think they have AIDS, have stayed away from institutions
known for treating people with the disease.
   Some insurance companies don't insure AIDS treatment and in
areas where government has required them to, like the District of
Columbia, the insurance companies leave town, he said.
   ``The public sector has provided enough money'' for AIDS care,
he said.
   During his speech, the surgeon general reiterated his call for
AIDS prevention through sexual abstinence, monogamy or condom use
and warned that free-needle programs will not wipe out the deadly
disease among intravenous drug abusers. He said camaraderie among
drug abusers leads to the sharing of needles and the potential
spread of AIDS.
   His two-hour speech and question-and-answer session to the
Philadelphia-based insurance company was also beamed to cable
subscribers nationwide, to Canada, Mexico and other parts of South
America and to Philadelphia's public school students.
   From September 1987 to this month, 31,000 new cases of patients
suffering from the symptoms of the disease have been diagnosed in
the United States, Koop said. There have been 73,000 AIDS cases,
41,000 of whom have died, reported worldwide since 1981, he said.
   Depending on the prevalence of AIDS in the area, the chances of
receiving a unit of blood infected with the virus are one in 40,000
to one in 250,000, he said.
   About 900 children have been born infected with the virus, he
said.
   Asked if there was a danger from vials containing AIDS-infected
blood washing up on beaches, Koop said exposure to salt water
inhibits the virus' ability to grow in a bloodstream or in a
laboratory.
   ``It's sort of icky to go swimming with a bunch of dirty
bandages floating around, but it won't kill you,'' he said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most frequently spread
though sexual contact with a partner infected with the virus or
sharing intravenous drug needles.

<HEAD>Cook County Patients May Get To Refuse Treatment by AIDS Virus
Carriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients at Cook County Hospital would have the
right to refuse treatment by workers who carry the AIDS virus under
a proposal praised by some in the medical community as an advance
in patients' rights but criticized by others as misinformed.
   The recommendation was approved Tuesday by the County Board's
Health and Hospitals Committee. It is expected to be endorsed by
the full board next week, becoming the first such policy for a U.S.
hospital, officials said.
   It would cover all hospital workers who ``routinely provide
direct patient care,'' including doctors and nurses.
   Cook County Hospital Director Terrence Hansen said the proposed
policy is an effort to increase patients' rights, but others in the
medical profession blasted the proposal Wednesday.
   ``Our reaction is one of dismay,'' said Dr. Lonnie Bristow,
speaking for the American Medical Association. ``There has been no
case in this country of a patient contracting the AIDS virus from a
health-care worker.
   ``It is important to keep in mind that the disease is not
transmitted by casual contact,'' Bristow, a member of the AMA's
board of trustees, said from his Berkeley, Calif., office. ``The
likelihood of transmission from a health-care worker is very
small.''
   The proposed policy ``is not offering (patients) any additional
protection. It implies people should be worried,'' he said.
   ``This is a policy based on fear and it will do no one any
good,'' said Dr. Renslow Sherer, who works in the AIDS prevention
service at Cook County Hospital. ``This is an ill-conceived and
ill-advised policy.''
   ``The fact that no other hospital has taken this action means
the hospitals don't see this as a major problem,'' said Ann Guild,
director of medical staff affairs for the Illinois Hospital
Association.
   ``It's not supported by scientific evidence that something like
this is necessary,'' Guild said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's defenses
against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening
infections and certain cancers.
   AIDS has struck more than 72,000 people in this country since
1979 and killed more than 40,000 of them, according to the national
Centers for Disease Control.
   The virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is
believed to be spread through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic
needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during
birth.
   The resolution was passed by the committee over the objections
of Cook County Hospital's House Staff Association, which represents
doctors at the institution, the Chicago Women's AIDS Project and
several other community organizations.
   Dr. Stonewall McCuiston, president of the House Staff
Association, said the policy ``would wrongly give the impression
that there is a high incidence of AIDS and HIV cases among County
Hospital Workers.''
   However, board member John Stroger said it is a case of a
patient's right to know.
   ``Doctors at County have told me they wouldn't let members of
their families be treated by a certain doctor at the hospital
(because they fear he has AIDS), but then they turn around and come
out for doctors' rights,'' Stroger said.
   Neurosurgeon Alan Bouffard, a Cook County doctor who died of
AIDS-related diseases in May, was stripped of his medical
privileges at the hospital in February 1987 by the county board,
which cited concerns about the spread of the disease.
   A year later, a federal judge ordered him reinstated, but
required him to wear double gloves for certain procedures.

   Residents of this celebrity enclave want a
memorial to honor the memory of a not-so-rich or famous inhabitant
_ a hermit known as Malibu Joe who spurned most offers of help.
   Joe, whose last name was believed to be either Castello or
Costello, died Sept. 4, six days after he was found severely beaten
and robbed. He was 96. He told police before he died that he
couldn't remember who had attacked him, and there have been no
arrests.
   Flowers and cards have been placed around the tiny
shrub-surrounded area behind a gas station that Joe called home.
   ``Malibu's devastated,'' said G.G. Gundry, a resident. ``If he'd
died of old age, people would be sad but not as upset as they are
now. When someone is murdered like that, it makes you realize the
world is changing.''
   Actress Ali MacGraw is among the locals who have joined i a
drive to build a memorial. More than $1,400 has been raised toward
installation of a bench and permanent plaque in his honor.
   Malibu Joe's body is still at the coroner's office. Authorities
say residents have expressed interest in paying for a funeral if no
kin comes forward.
   ``There is a possibility we will have a memorial service at
Malibu Bluff Park. We're trying to something together,'' said
Malibu Times editor Gil Peters.
   Malibu Joe refused handouts, leading local real estate agent
Louis Busch to once declare that if Malibu ever incorporated, Joe
should be mayor because ``nobody can get to him _ if you try to
give him even a dollar, he gets very upset.''
   But Joe would occasionally accept items left at his spot.
   ``He wasn't considered a transient or a bum by us. He was a
classic fixture in the community,'' said Peters. ``There was a
certain pride in Malibu Joe that isn't typical with the usual
street people. For some reason, he turned himself into a folk
hero.''

   South African police killed three
hijackers and arrested the fourth in a shootout Wednesday night
that ended a hostage drama in which the gunmen seized a bus
carrying 71 pilgrims headed to see the pope, South African
officials said.
   One of the hostages, a young woman, was killed, and 11
passengers were injured, the officials said.
   The report of the shootout came from South African police
headquarters. Lesotho's military government had requested South
African help in handling the hijacking. Police said the shootout
occurred when the hijackers tried to drive the bus through the
closed gates of the British High Commission in Maseru.
   The hijackers began shooting, and South African officers
returned fire.
   Police said the casualties among the hostages were ``apparently
caused by the wild firing of the hijackers.'' They said no
policemen were injured.
   The shooting broke out about 20 minutes after Pope John Paul II
arrived in Maseru, eight hours behind schedule. The hijackers
earlier had demanded to meet with the pope and Lesotho's king,
Moshoeshoe II, a government official said.
   After nightfall, gunfire was heard at the site where the bus was
parked, and flares lit up the sky. Reporters were blocked from
getting close enough to the scene to determine what was happening
but saw ambulances take bloodied bodies, one of them a nun, to a
hospital.
   Police ordered journalists at the scene to disperse and then
chased them away with whips. The bus was hijacked Tuesday night en
route to Maseru.
   Earlier Wednesday, bad weather forced the pope's plane to land
in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he met Foreign Minister Pik
Botha at the airport and was briefed about the hijacking.
   The pope then journeyed overland to Lesotho.
   Before the shootout, helicopters and armed cars blanketed
central Maseru as 100 armed soldiers and police set up roadblocks
and kept spectators at least four blocks from the bus, parked
outside the British High Commission.
   One man escaped earlier today from the bus, said Tom Thabane,
secretary for Lesotho's six-man military council.
   Thabane said the hijackers were members of the dissident Lesotho
Liberation Army. The Lesotho Liberation Army had been opposed to
the leftist government of the late Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan.
A number of bombings and killings were attributed to the group,
which reportedly had South African backing.

   A man who strangled his former roommate
because he threatened to infect him with the fatal AIDS virus by
biting him was acquitted of murder Wednesday.
   Dale David Dalton of Laguna Beach bowed his head in Orange
County Superior Court when the jury announced its verdict after
three days of deliberations.
   Dalton, 34, was charged with first-degree murder in the 1987
strangulation of Edward Ihling in the Laguna Beach home they once
shared.
   Dalton testified that he strangled Ihling with a shirt in
self-defense after the man lunged at him with his teeth bared,
threatening to infect him with AIDS.
   Deputy District Attorney Richard King alleged, however, that
Dalton was planning to shoot Ihling because he had told Dalton's
boss that he was a homosexual and drug dealer.
   ``I'll start over again,'' Dalton said outside court. ``I'm just
glad this whole thing is over.''

<HEAD>Keith Richards: Jagger Didn't Appreciate Stones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mick Jagger wants the Rolling Stones to reunite
because he's getting no satisfaction out of his solo career, fellow
Stone Keith Richards says.
   ``I spoke to him about it the other week, because now he wants
to put the Stones back together _ because there's nowhere else to
go,'' Richards said in an interview in the Oct. 6 Rolling Stone
magazine.
   Richards, who's about to release his own solo effort, ``Talk is
Cheap,'' said he never wanted to record without the Stones. But
Jagger, he said, thought he had outgrown the group when he turned
solo in 1986.
   ``Mick kind of lost touch with the fact of how important the
Stones were for him,'' he said. ``He thought he could just hire
another Rolling Stones. ... And you can't. You can't hire that kind
of thing.''
   Jagger, he said, had a ``Peter Pan complex'' and was determined
to compete with younger musicians for space on the Top 10.
   ``To me, 25 years of integrity went down the drain with what he
did,'' said Richards.
   Although Richards verbally pummelled Jagger in the interview, he
insisted he did it out of friendship.
   ``He's not living a happy life,'' said Richards. ``To me, that's
unacceptable. I've got to make him happy! To me, I've failed if I
can't eventually get my mate to feel good about himself.''

<HEAD>Soldier Denies Security Chief Ordered IRA Members Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of four British soldiers who shot and
killed three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas in March
denied Wednesday that his commander sent the anti-terrorist unit to
eliminate the guerrillas.
   He testified before a court investigating whether members of the
Special Air Services were justified in killing the guerrillas, who
the IRA has acknowledged were on a mission in this British colony.
   
   ``Our only intention was to arrest (them),'' said ``soldier B,''
hidden from public view by a curtain for security reasons.
   A senior British intelligence officer has testified at the
inquest that the soldiers believed the three were armed and were
planning to set off a car bomb during a changing of the guard
ceremony.
   ``(The IRA members') movements precipitated our action,'' he
said. ``I believe with the information we were given, we did the
correct thing.''
   The officer testified on the seventh day of an inquest by
Coroner Felix Pizzarello and an 11-member jury into the March 6
shooting deaths of Sean Savage, 24, Mairead Farrell, 31, and Daniel
McCann, 31.
   
   Patrick McGrory, the attorney for the families of the IRA
members, suggested to soldier B that their tactical commander,
identified only as ``soldier E,'' sent them out on the
anti-terrorist mission ``with the impression that the suspects were
too dangerous to be allowed to live.''
   During questioning, the McRory challenged soldier B:
   ``You were told to go out and kill (the IRA members) and the
task was made so plain to you that you feared no legal retribution
for your actions.''
   ``No,'' the soldier responded.
   The three guerrillas proved to be unarmed when the soldiers
opened fire on them near a gas station in Gibraltar. Critics of
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government cited the
shootings as evidence that her government is implementing an
unofficial ``shoot-to-kill'' policy against IRA members believed to
be on missions to attack British targets.
   Spanish police found a car linked to the IRA and loaded with 141
pounds of explosives and a timing device in the Spanish resort of
Marbella two days after the shooting.
   The inquest has no power of prosecution against the seven men
who formed the unit that took part in the operation against the IRA
members. If the jury hands down a verdict of unlawful killing, the
Gibraltar attorney general is expected to return criminal
indictments.
    The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to oust the British
from Northern Ireland and to unite the province with the mostly
Catholic republic of Ireland.
   In another incident on Wednesday, police arrested a British man
when he tried to enter Gibraltar from Spain in a van with British
license plates.
   Chief Inspector Glen Viagas said the man, accompanied by a
woman, a teen-ager and a child, was arrested after customs
officials searched his white Leyland van and found a .22 caliber
pistol, six rounds of ammunition and 16 canisters believed to hold
tear gas and a gas gun, Viagas said.
   He said the man, whom police did not identify, carried a British
passport and is believed to be from Scotland. He was taken to a
Gibraltar police station for questioning.
   Viagas said the arrest did not appear to be connected to the
inquest.

<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

   U.S. industrial production rose a modest 0.2
percent in August, the smallest gain in five months, following a
much larger July advance, the government said Wednesday.
   The Federal Reserve said the increase in August, the 11th
consecutive month without a decline, followed a revised 1 percent
July advance, which had been the strongest showing since last
October.
   The August increase was in line with expectations and analysts
said it should calm fears that the economy was overheating.
   With factories operating at their highest levels in eight years,
there had been fears that rising demand pressures would spark an
inflationary spiral. But since late March, the Federal Reserve has
been pushing interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and
economists said this strategy is working.
   ``The fears of overheating are dying down,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting
firm. ``We are not looking for a recession, but we are getting
fairly clear evidence that the economy is slowing down.''
   Wyss predicted that the overall economy, which expanded at an
annual rate of 3.3 percent in the first half of the year, as
measured by the gross national product, should grow at about that
rate in the current July-September quarter, but then begin slowing
in the final three months of 1988.
   The August increase in industrial production, the smallest since
an identical 0.2 percent March advance, pushed output at U.S.
factories, mines and utilities up by 5.3 percent over the level of
a year ago.
   ``Manufacturing continued to grow but just did so more slowly,
coming on the heels of the big July advance,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The manufacturing sector was in
good health over the summer.''
   The report showed that American producers were continuing to
benefit from record high demand for their goods overseas.
   In a separate report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said
that the country's merchandise trade deficit narrowed dramatically
in July to a $9.5 billion gap as a small increase in exports and a
big drop in imports gave the country its smallest trade imbalance
since December 1984.
   Manufacturing companies saw their output advance by 0.2 percent
following a 0.9 percent July increase. Output at plants making
durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, rose by
0.2 percent, while factories making non-durable goods had a 0.1
percent increase.
   Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7 million units in
August, down slightly from July, but production of light trucks
showed an increase.
   Production of business equipment, which has been strong all
year, rose 0.2 percent in August and now stands 9.7 percent higher
than a year ago. Analysts said this reflected a big investment push
on the part of companies buying computers and other capital
equipment.
   Production in the mining sector fell by 0.3 percent as coal
production declined after a huge increase in July.
   The nation's utilities boosted production by 2.1 percent in
August, reflecting a continuation of the summer heat wave.
   The various changes left industrial output at 138.2 percent of
its 1977 base of 100.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Will Go Along With Ban on Big Bank-Securities Mergers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
told Congress Wednesday he sees no need for a blanket ban on
mergers of the biggest banks and securities firms, but will go
along with such a ban to win passage of legislation permitting
banks to underwrite securities.
   Bills passed by the full Senate and House Banking Committee
would permit bank holding companies to underwrite many securities.
But both bills, in provisions aimed at blocking the creation of
financial giants, forbid the merger of the 15 largest securities
firms with the 15 largest banking companies.
   However, Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, which is reviewing the bill, said he may offer
an amendment to bring the bill in line with antitrust law, which
focuses on the power of merged firms in specific regional or
product markets.
   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., ranking minority member on the
Judiciary subcommittee on monopolies, said the largest banks and
securities firms currently represent little more than 1 percent of
their current markets.
   Greenspan told subcommittee members that he and fellow Fed
governors ``see no threat to the system if those (merger)
activities were to take place.'' But he said they did not believe
it was wise to press the issue for fear of hurting chances for
repealing the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial from
investment banking in 1933.
   He also said he thought such large mergers unlikely. Large banks
are more likely to purchase several small securities firms or start
up a securities division on their own, he said.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., sponsor of the Senate bill and
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is strongly in favor of
merger limits.
   However, Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, whose
office regulates nationally chartered banks, said ``arbitrary
prohibition on certain mergers is not ... appropriate.'' He urged
the subcommittee to strike the size limits from the House bill and
allow regulators to judge each merger individually for its effect
on competition.
   Greenspan branded a number of other provisions in the House bill
as anti-competitive, including: a ban on corporate stock
underwriting; the prohibition of banks and securities affiliates
from sharing corporate names, logos, premises or advertising, and a
restriction on banks ability to sell insurance.

<HEAD>Hodel Won't Force Park Service to Change Fire-fighting Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel said
Wednesday he won't force the National Park Service to change its
fire-fighting policy, but he repeated his belief that the ``let it
burn'' policy had been a failure and predicted modifications will
be made before the next fire season.
   ``I think we'll just have to see what they come up with as a
recommendation,'' Hodel said in an interview, referring to the
policy review just getting under way by the service in cooperation
with the Forest Service and other agencies. ``I'm not planning to
impose a policy.''
   Comments by environmentalists and others that the ``let it
burn'' policy had succeeded were ``a backfire'' by people who fear
changes, he said.
   ``Let it burn'' is how the Park Service unofficially described
its practice since 1972 of letting most naturally caused fires burn
themselves out for the benefits they bring to forest regeneration.
   The policy called for fighting fires that threatened human
settlement and property, significant park structures and resources,
and all fires started by humans.
   On July 21, pressed by the worst fire season in 300 or 400 years
in Yellowstone National Park and the rest of the West, the Park
Service decided to fight all fires because it could not be sure
than any one would not get out of control. It extended that
``suppression'' policy to all its parks in August.
   The service has argued that the buildup of dead trees and other
fuel from the 100 years of suppressing all fires before 1972 could
not be burned off in the 16 years since then, and that buildup made
this year's fires far worse than they should have been, resulting
in fire over nearly half of the park in blazes that could not have
been put out no matter when they were attacked.
   Some environmental groups have argued that the policy worked and
should be supported, and that no one could have predicted the
severity of the drought or the fires. Leaders of these supporting
groups usually add that people living around Yellowstone _ the most
vigorous critics of the policy _ deserve some help for the damage
done to their businesses by the decline in tourism.
   ``I don't think the majority of the American people would say
this policy has worked and I would say the American people are
right,'' Hodel said.
   Asked to define a successful policy, the secretary replied:
``I'd rather define what is not successful. A policy is not
successful if the result'' subjects communities in and near the
park ``to extreme jeopardy and evacuations because you didn't know
if you were going to be able to control the fires,'' as happened
this year.
   He said he believed the Park Service policy change July 21 had
happened ``fairly quickly'' in the light of available information.
Asked whether that change was made quickly enough, he responded,
``I'm not going to engage in that kind of thing because the Monday
morning quarterback never gets sacked.''
   Noting that William Penn Mott, director of the Park Service, and
Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, had admitted that in
hindsight they would have fought every fire from the beginning,
Hodel said he thought Park Service officials were not satisfied
with the results of the ``let it burn'' policy either.
   Asked if he were trying to satisfy both critics of the service
as well as the service and its supporters, he replied: ``No. I'm
trying to be responsive to the best professional and technical
advice.''

<TEXT>
   Cold, damp weather retarded blazes and chilled firefighters at
Yellowstone National Park, and firefighters in California worked
Wednesday to put out hot spots and make Gold Rush County, where
nearly 100 homes burned, ``wind-proof.''
   But experts cautioned that the West's worst fire season in
decades wasn't necessarily over yet.
   The fires that have devastated nearly a million acres of the
nation's oldest national park have grown together to form a single
blaze, but cold, wet weather has helped firefighters, officials
said.
   ``It's been so cold out there the firefighters are coming in to
get warm, and that's really good if they can't stay warm fighting a
fire,'' said Denny Bungarz, a fire commander at Yellowstone, where
temperatures had dipped as low as the upper 20s overnight.
   Elsewhere, firefighters worked to complete lines around a
stubborn blaze in Glacier National Park in Montana, where afternoon
temperatures climbed into the 70s but winds stayed relatively calm.
Army reinforcements began arriving Wednesday for a final assault on
the giant Canyon Creek fire in west-central Montana.
   Fires also continued in several other Western states, including
Washington, where firefighters Wednesday took advantage of calm
weather to dig more lines around a blaze in Olympic National Park.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel confirmed Wednesday that the
forest service's widely criticized policy of letting naturally
caused fires burn was being revised. The fires resulting from the
drought of 1988, which have charred more than 4 million acres, show
that the policy ``just doesn't make sense,'' he said in a
television interview.
   About 30,000 firefighters continued to battle 32 fires in eight
Western states, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   In northern California, officials of the state forestry
department said they were making plans to start sending
firefighters back to their home stations, although the first
significant pullout probably wouldn't take place until Thursday.
   The sudden brushfire that destroyed nearly 100 homes Sunday and
Monday ebbed almost as rapidly as it had spread, and all but a few
of an estimated 8,000 people who had been evacuated at one time or
another had returned home by Wednesday.
   ``The top priority today is to pick up all the remaining hot
spots that are left. We want to be wind-proof,'' fire operations
chief Ed Waggoner said, noting that stiffer winds are expected
again in the Sierras beginning Friday.
   At Yellowstone, low overnight temperatures forced humidity up to
almost 100 percent at times, Bungarz said Wednesday morning.
   ``The weather has really knocked this down,'' he said. ``So
unless the weather changes drastically, we're definitely in the
mop-up stage.''
   Although forecasts called for warmer, drier weather, the high
winds that last week allowed fires to grow by thousands of acres
each day were not expected.
   But Bungarz stressed that the fires have surprised firefighters
in the past. He would not call the blazes controlled or contained.
   ``This is ... tricky,'' he said.
   All the fires in the park have burned into one another, Bungarz
said, in essence creating one fire stretching from the park's
southern end to its northeastern corner.
   In all, fires in the greater Yellowstone area covered about 1.5
million acres, including land in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah and Montana,
and have cost more than $100 million to fight.
   With clouds that have covered the park since Sunday breaking up
Wednesday morning, fire officials prepared for warmer weather that
would let them see how well fire lines that have been built Sunday
would hold up, said park spokesman Steve Iobst.
   ``As long as things don't get crazy here again, a lot of
progress can be made by people on the ground,'' he said.
   In the Bridger-Teton National Forest southeast of the park,
officials said firefighters had contained 90 percent of the
225,500-acre Huck-Mink fire complex and estimated they would
control the 38,500-acre Fayette fire by Friday.
   Ed Christian, Grand Teton National Park assistant chief ranger,
said officials have started releasing firefighters from both fires.

   A man claiming he wanted to promote peace
in Lebanon held 11 people at gunpoint at a military recruiting
center Wednesday before releasing them unharmed and surrendering.
   The gunman, identified as Samuel Eloud, 20, of suburban Henrico
County, was being held at county police headquarters on 11 counts
of abduction and 11 counts of use of a firearm in commission of a
felony, authorities said.
   Police Sgt. Joe Sands said Eloud described himself to police
during telephone negotiations as being of Lebanese descent and said
he had two armed companions.
   The gunman began releasing his captives after two local radio
stations broadcast a statement, but his goal was not immediately
clear and he made no specific threats, said Sands.
   Slight and wearing a yellow T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, Eloud
walked out of the center about 10 minutes after his last hostage,
placed an AK-47 and what looked like ammunition clips on the
ground, then went back inside and emerged with a pistol, which he
also laid on the ground.
   He placed his hands on top of his head as directed by police
officers, who handcuffed him and led him away.
   The gunman seized the U.S. Armed Forces Recruiting Center about
9:15 a.m, taking hostage nine military personnel and two civilians.
   A Marine recruiter reporting for work about 9:30 a.m. spotted
the gunman through the front window and went to an adjacent store
to call police, said police Lt. C.M. Schesventer. The gunman also
telephoned police and remained in contact with a negotiator for the
next 4{ hours.
   He released the first hostages, a female civilian and a high
school senior enlisting in the service, about 12:15 p.m. and
gradually sent out the rest before surrendering about 1:50 p.m.
   There were no injuries and no shots were fired, Schesventer
said. Authorities declined to give the hostages' names.
   The recruiting station is in a strip shopping center on a
heavily developed commercial street running into suburban Henrico
County from Richmond. Authorities evacuated the stores and cleared
the parking lot as about 30 police vehicles cordoned off the area.
Flak-jacketed police carrying automatic weapons and shotguns took
up positions in the lot and on nearby rooftops.
   Richmond stations WRNL-AM and WRXL-FM went along with a Henrico
County request to air a brief statement. It was read two times
about noon, when authorities still believed the gunman had
accomplices.
   ``There is a hostage situation at Tuckernuck Square Shopping
Center,'' the statement said. ``There have been no injuries.
Negotiations are proceeding. The hostage-takers have so far been
cooperative. They're holding an undetermined number of people. The
hostage-takers' goal is peace in Lebanon.''
   Lebanon has been racked by sectarian fighting since 1975.
   In Washington, D.C., the American Arab Anti-discrimination
Committee issued a statement condemning the action, which it called
a ``senseless act of terrorism.''
   ``We fervently hope that this isolated instance of violence will
not fan the flames of anti-Arab sentiment in the United States,''
said the statement from committee President Abdeen Jabara.
   ``Terrorism never has been and never will be an acceptable
solution to the very real anguish and suffering of the Lebanese
people.''

   FBI Director William Sessions suspended three
FBI employees and censured three others Thursday for negligently
operating what he told Congress was an ``unnecessarily broad''
terrorism probe into a group opposing the Reagan administration's
Central American policies.
   All those disciplined were lower- and mid-level employees. The
suspensions were for 14 days without pay.
   Sessions said top-level officials had been unaware the bureau
was collecting information ``on rank-and-file members'' of the
Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador who he said
had ``nothing to do with international terrorism.''
   Sessions said there is no evidence that the White House or any
other government agency or outside private group attempted to
influence the CISPES probe. The investigation took place between
March 1983 and June 1985 when William Webster was FBI director.
Sessions became FBI head last November, after Webster was named CIA
director.
   Sessions, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee,
vowed to institute changes that would keep top bureau officials
fully apprised of sensitive terrorism investigations that might
impinge on constitutional rights.
   The CISPES probe began in March 1983 based largely on
information from a now-discredited informant in Dallas, Frank
Varelli, alleging the group was supplying financial support to two
terrorist organizations and preparing for terrorist activities in
the United States.
   ``Varelli's background was not checked, he was not properly and
thoroughly reviewed and there was just negligence all the way along
the line,'' Sessions told the committee. Sessions said that without
the Varelli claims of terrorist activity, there would have been an
insufficient basis to investigate CISPES.
   Committee chairman Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., suggested that
much of Varelli's information came from unproven allegations
published in a right-wing magazine in Mexico.
   Sessions disciplined a supervisor and former assistant special
agent in charge of the Dallas FBI office and a supervisor in
another unspecified bureau, along with a field supervisor, unit
chief and section chief at bureau headquarters in Washington. All
six were given written reprimands and three of them were placed on
probation and suspended from duty without pay for 14 calendar days.
He did not give their names.
   Sources familiar with the action by Sessions identified three of
those being disciplined as George Van Balen, chief of the
international terrorism-global unit at FBI headquarters in
Washington; Ronald Davenport, a supervisory special agent in the
Washington headquarters; and Parks Stearns, a supervisory special
agent in Dallas.
   A seventh employee, ``whose performance would in all likelihood
would have merited dismissal,'' said Sessions, has resigned. That
was an apparent reference to Varelli's handler who quit in 1984,
after acknowledging he had given classified documents from FBI
files to Varelli and failed to pass along money that was to have
been paid to the informer.
   ``The major turning point'' in the probe came when it was
``unnecessarily broadened'' in October 1983 to becme nationwide
scope, Sessions testified. ``It remained unnecessarily broad
thereafter.''
   ``There was no reason to believe that all CISPES members
nationwide knew of or had any involvement in support of El
Salvadoran or U.S. terrorists,'' testified Sessions. The decision
to widen the investigation ``was made at a comparatively low level
and ... supervisory personnel at FBI headquarters who should have
reviewed and analyzed this decision and appreciated its
significance failed to do so.''
   The investigation involved all the FBI's bureaus, encompassed
180 CISPES chapters across the country and spawned 178 spinoff
investigations, including probes of nine groups and the remainder
probes of individuals, he said.
   FBI agents photographed protesters at peace rallies, recorded
license plate numbers and investigated nuns, union members and
college students.
   The CISPES probe involved surveillance, undercover attendance at
meetings, interviews with organization members and checks of
telephone and utility company records and records of license and
credit bureaus, as well as law enforcement agency record checks.
   Sessions said FBI inspectors who investigated the handling of
the CISPES probe found 31 instances where agents may have violated
the attorney general's guidelines for carrying out international
terrorism probes. He said 15 of them were subsequently found to be
violations, including 13 deemed serious enough to be reported to
the President's Intelligence Oversight Board.
   But the CISPES investigation ``does not reflect a policy of
purposeful interference with legitimate domestic political
activity,'' he said.
   The probe was closed in June 1985 after the Justice Department
concluded the group was involved in political activities protected
by the First Amendment and not involved in terrorism.
   Varelli's information was deemed unreliable approximately one
year into the investigation, yet it continued for another year and
when Boren asked why, Sessions said:
   ``There were other informants, there was still the suggestion
that there would be disruptions'' by CISPES at the Republican
National Convention in Dallas in 1984.
   Michael Ratner, legal director of the Center for Constitutional
Rights, said the center will file a lawsuit if the bureau doesn't
expunge the names of those investigated. The center obtained FBI
documents early this year disclosing the CISPES probe.
   Ratner told a news conference after the hearing that the
disciplined FBI personnel should have been fired, adding that the
``level and amount of punishment'' should have been more severe.
   ``What we see here is only smoke,'' said Ratner.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II arrived in this tiny
kingdom Wednesday just 20 minutes before a bloody shootout between
police and gunmen holding a busload of nuns and children on a papal
pilgrimage.
   Four people reportedly died.
   John Paul was to fly from Botswana to Lesotho today but bad
weather forced his chartered jet to make an unscheduled landing in
South Africa, the target of his criticism during his southern
Africa tour.
   The pope arrived in Lesotho eight hours behind schedule and just
20 minutes before the tense hostage drama was played out.
   Police said gunmen hijacked the bus carrying with about 70
people Tuesday, drove it to the British High Commission, or
embassy, compound and demanded to meet the pope. Authorities said
the hijackers began firing after they tried to drive the vehicle
through the closed gates of the embassy compound.
   Three hijackers and a hostage, a young woman, were killed in a
gun battle with police, authorities said. Eleven other passengers
were wounded, the rest of the hostages were rescued, and one
hijacker was arrested, police said.
   The hijackers held police at bay through Tuesday night while
demanding to meet John Paul and Lesotho's king, Moshoeshoe II, a
government official said.
   John Paul, meanwhile, had intended to bypass South Africa on his
tour of five neighboring, black-ruled nations.
   But his flight from Botswana to Lesotho was diverted because of
bad weather, and he spent three hours at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts
Airport before heading overland in a police-escorted convoy to
rain-soaked Lesotho, about 270 miles away.
   Members of Lesotho's military council greeted the pontiff at the
border, but crowds along the route into Maseru were sparse because
of the wet, chilly weather.
   John Paul did not kiss the ground in Johannesburg, as he
customarily does the first time he visits a country, and made no
public statements there. He conferred privately with Foreign
Minister Pik Botha.
   South Africa said it sent special police units into Lesotho, at
the government's request, to assist if necessary in dealing with
the hijackers. Lesotho is surrounded by South Africa.
   Robin Cartwright, pilot of the pope's chartered Air Zimbabwe
Boeing 707, earlier circled over Maseru, Lesotho's capital, for 30
minutes before deciding to divert the flight because of low clouds
and malfunctioning radio beacons at the airport.
   The pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, said John Paul was
reading a book of philosophy when he was told of the problem,
looked up, and said: ``This was not on the schedule.''
   At Jan Smuts, Botha greeted the pope and accompanied him into a
VIP lounge while security forces deployed inside and outside the
terminal.
   ``We consider it a privilege to assist the Holy Father,'' said
Botha, who ordered 100 meals and several bottles of wine for the
entourage and had lunch with the pope.
   Botha said he briefed John Paul on the hijacking and discussed
the political situation in southern Africa.
   South Africans were deeply involved in logistical arrangements
for the papal visit to Lesotho. Hundreds of thousands of South
Africans had been expected to cross the border to see the pope
during his scheduled 48-hour visit, but the bad weather sharply
reduced the flow of arrivals and huge tent villages set up to
accommodate pilgrims were virtually empty.
   A hard, freezing rain fell as King Moshoeshoe and other
officials waited at the airport for hours before the announcement
that the pope would come by road.
   Rain normally is considered a sign of good luck in Lesotho, but
officials said the downpour was a disaster, disrupting the pope's
schedule and wrecking entrepreneurs' hopes of profiting from the
expected large crowds.
   Lesotho was to be the third stop on a 10-day trip also taking
the pontiff to Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland and Mozambique. The
aborted flight began in Botswana.
   The Vatican has said the pope was advised by South Africa's
Catholic bishops that this was not an appropriate time for him to
visit their racially divided nation.
   South Africa's Catholic bishops have been active in the
anti-apartheid movement, particularly since 17 major black
opposition groups were banned in February.
   The white-controlled government has blamed the bishops for the
pope's decision to omit South Africa from his official itinerary.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Clews Back On FTC Payroll While Probe Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carter Clews was back on the Federal Trade
Commission payroll Wednesday while the agency looked into the
matter of letters he sent that were critical of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Clews left the commission last week after being given a choice
of resigning or being fired, following criticism that the letters
may have violated the Hatch Act which bans political activity by
federal workers.
   But Clews later said he was being fired without due process that
he would seek reinstatement.
   Commission general counsel Robert Paul met with Clews Wednesday
and said that the press aide was now being treated as an employee
of the commission.
   Clews will be on administrative leave, with pay, until Paul
completes an investigation and reports to Commission Chairman
Daniel Oliver, the counsel said.
   A final decision probably will be up to Oliver and the other
commissioners.
   The dispute developed after letters were sent out questioning
statements Dukakis had made about the commission and offering the
services of commission members to respond. Some letters to
newspapers included a postscript critical of Dukakis.
   At least one set carried the name of Anna Davis, public affairs
director for the agency, although she contended that wasn't her
signature. Clews, however, said that she signed and approved the
letter.

   The Agriculture Department said Wednesday it
erred in giving out a telephone number for people to call offering
comments on a proposal to allow a mixture of salvaged meat and bone
in hotdogs without stating the ingredients on labels.
   A terse ``correction'' notice by the department's information
office said that all comments should be submitted in writing by
Nov. 8.
   Dave Warren, USDA press chief, said agency officials were ``not
prepared to take oral comments, so they'll have to be in writing.''
   The proposal was announced by USDA on Monday. It would allow
processors to include a mixture of salvaged meat, including small
bits of bone, to be used in up to 10 percent of the meat content of
hotdogs and similar items without showing the ingredients on
product labels.
   The salvaged product, designated as MS(S), or mechanically
separated (species, such as pork or beef), is made by grinding up
ribs, neckbones and other hard-to-carve parts of slaughtered
animals and forcing the mixture through sieves.
   Most of the bone particles are screened out, but some _ about
the size of ground pepper flakes _ remain in the mixture.
   Current regulations permit the MS(S) to comprise up to 20
percent of the meat portion of hotdogs, bologna and other sausages,
but the labels must state the contents.
   Processors, who asked for the exemption from the labeling rule,
said they can't sell consumers on the idea of having such a mixture
in hotdogs under the present labeling requirement.
   The written comments can be sent by Nov. 8 to: Policy Office,

<BYLINE>GM, Ford Warn Stricter Fuel Economy Standards Would Cost Jobs</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Failure to loosen fuel economy standards for
1989 and 1990 cars will cost American jobs and may drive carbuyers
into the showrooms of foreign manufacturers, the nation's two
largest automakers said Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., at a public hearing,
urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to keep
the mandatory fuel economy level from reverting to 27.5 miles per
gallon in October.
   Both GM and Ford said they could not produce a mix of cars that
would have a corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, at that
level. Chrysler Corp., the third large U.S. automaker, projected it
will meet or exceed a 27.5 mpg standard next year and did not speak
at the hearing.
   The standard has been set at 26 mpg since 1986 under an
exception allowed by NHTSA.
   The fuel-economy law, adopted in 1975 to reduce imported
petroleum consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices, sets a
maximum level of fuel consumption each automaker's fleet of
passenger cars, on average, must meet.
   ``Ford's inability to meet the 27.5 mpg CAFE standard for 1989
and 1990 is not because of lack of effort, but instead is because
of substantial market and economic changes,'' said Donald Buist,
Ford's director of automotive emissions and fuel economy.
   With gasoline prices averaging below $1 a gallon, larger cars
are selling well as consumers look for luxury and performance
rather than concentrating on mileage, Buist said.
   The corporate average fuel economy is calculated on the basis of
sales, and public demand for less fuel efficient large cars drives
the average up, the automakers said.
   ``Overly stringent CAFE standards restrict domestic production
of larger cars and higher performance engines,'' Buist said.
``Foreign manufacturers, in particular the Japanese, are ready and
willing to meet this consumer demand with vehicles built or sourced
predominately in foreign countries. This could result in the loss
of thousands of U.S. jobs without any appreciable fuel economy
savings.''
   GM presented Transportation Secretary James Burnley with 5,000
letters from employees of and retirees from its Arlington, Texas,
assembly plant, their families and labor leaders urging him to
lower the CAFE standard to 26.5 mpg.
   A 27.5 mpg standard would force cutbacks in big-car production,
resulting in layoffs in Arlington and elsewhere that would cost GM
and its suppliers 60,000 jobs in 1989 and 110,000 jobs in 1990,
said Richard Klimisch, GM's environmental activities executive
director.
   Klimisch said GM has lost in its share of the market because
``we've gone too far with CAFE.''
   ``It doesn't do any good to put in new technology if you can't
sell the cars,'' Klimisch said.
   Opponents of looser standards urged NHTSA to raise the
fuel-economy requirement to 27.5 mpg as the agency has proposed.
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, a
consumers group, said if the standards were relaxed, ``the domestic
manufacturers would virtually become importers of everything but
large cars, given the projected worldwide glut of auto production
capacity.'' The result, he said, would be the export of U.S. jobs.
   The center proposed raising the standard to 55 mpg by the turn
of the century, beginning at 30 mpg in 1991.
   NHTSA said it expects to issue a rule on the 1989 and 1990
standards within weeks.
   GM said its 1988 average fleet mileage would be 27.5 mpg or 27.6
mpg. Ford projected average fuel economy of 26.5 mpg this year, and
Chrysler said its cars would average 28.5 mpg.

<HEAD>Opposition Demands Answers After Expulsion Of Cuban Envoys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders on Wednesday demanded an
explanation of a mysterious shooting incident that led to the swift
expulsion of the Cuban ambassador and a junior envoy, who allegedly
fired on a British security team.
   ``The Foreign Office remains mute in the face of allegations and
counter-allegations about a cloak-and-dagger intrigue which makes
James Bond read like a railway timetable,'' said the Labor Party's
foreign affairs spokesman, George Foulkes.
   The abrupt expulsion of the two diplomats and the government's
refusal to comment on a host of allegations triggered charges that
officials were trying to cover up an intelligence operation.
   Foulkes urged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to explain ``the
secret spider's web of espionage'' and the extent of involvement by
MI5, Britain's counter-espionage agency.
   The Foreign Office stuck to its position that Third Secretary
Carlos Manuel Medina Perez behaved improperly by opening fire
Monday afternoon in a London street, and said the circumstances
behind the shooting were irrelevant. Both Medina and Cuban
Ambassador Oscar Fernandez-Mell were expelled and left Tuesday.
   British government sources acknowledged Tuesday that Medina was
being trailed by ``security agents.''
   Officially, authorities said Medina fired at a group of three
men and a woman, slightly wounding one man. Police have interviewed
the wounded man but refused to identify him and say the case is
closed.
   Cuba's communist government said one of the men allegedly
trailing Medina Perez was Florentino Azpillaga Lombard, a former
Cuban diplomat who they say defected to the United States and is
working with the CIA.
   Cuba said he was trying to force Medina to defect.
   Reaction in Cuba was uniformly harsh.
   ``Scotland Yard amazed the world by saying that the case is
closed before being opened,'' said an editorial in the Cuban
Communist Party newspaper Granma, which was broadcast by radio and
monitored in Miami.
   ``It is not a surprise because what happened in London was one
of the more calamitous joint operations of the CIA and the British
Secret Service,'' it added.
   The editorial charged the British government, Secret Service and
the CIA ``have been caught with their hands in the cookie jar.''
   The affair highlighted what former British Foreign Secretary
David Owen said was routine surveillance of communist diplomats
suspected of spying.
   ``The more I hear about this Cuban so-called diplomat, the more
likely I think it is that he was under surveillance, and quite
rightly so,'' said Owen, foreign secretary in a Labor government
before Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party won power in 1979.
   Owen added that an attempt to get Medina to defect would be
``not uncommon.''
   ``There's nothing wrong with that ... the fundamental issue is
that we're not having people opening fire in the streets of London
and than claiming (diplomatic) immunity,'' he said.

   Utilities that contracted with the
Washington Public Power Supply System purposely misled bond buyers
about the need for two nuclear power plants and never intended to
make good on their $2.25 billion bond debts, a lawyer argued
Wednesday.
   Official statements made to entice investors to buy WPPSS bonds
contained ``a number of false promises,'' attorney Tom Barr said in
the plaintiffs' opening statement. He represents Chemical Bank of
New York, which has sued on behalf of 24,000 bond buyers.
   ``We claim, and we will prove that these false statements were
made fraudulently ... and negligently,'' Barr said.
   The defendants deny the claims of fraud, saying poor judgment
may have been used, but that WPPSS and defendant utilities hired
expert advisers and acted in what they believed were the best
interests of power consumers in the Northwest.
   Twenty people were selected last week to serve as jurors in the
huge, complex case. The trial, moved here from Washington state
because of pretrial publicity, was expected to take months.
   WPPSS was formed in 1957 by public utilities to build and
operate major electric plants in Washington, Idaho and Oregon.
   In the 1970s, it embarked on an ambitious plan to build five
nuclear power plants, but was plagued by cost overruns and
construction delays. Only one plant was completed and is operating.
   In 1983, WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds sold for the
fourth and fifth of those plants, leaving thousands of bond buyers
holding worthless paper and spurring a host of lawsuits. The
default was the biggest in the history of the municipal bond
market. The two nuclear plants were never completed.
   Barr said the 16 defendant utilities, which are WPPSS directors,
claimed there was a need for more electricity in the Northwest when
there was not. They also repeatedly changed cost estimates for the
plants, he said.
   The first of 14 bond sales estimated that the two plants would
cost $3.37 billion, he said. That was in June 1977. In May 1981,
Barr said, the estimate had jumped to $11.8 billion, and the dates
for plant completion had jumped several years.
   The ultimate ``ace up their sleeve,'' Barr said of the
utilities, was the Washington state court system.
   ``They intended first to go to court to try to get their state
courts to get them out of their promises,'' he said, adding that it
worked.
   The default occurred after the Washington state Supreme Court
ruled the 88 utilities participating in construction of the two
plants had signed illegal contracts.
   Besides the 16 utilities with special ties to the supply system,
remaining defendants include two engineering firms and an adviser
to WPPSS. Seven other utilities settled out of court with the
plaintiffs.

<HEAD>US Prepared To Move Bases If Pushed, Carlucci Warns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci bluntly
warned the Philippines' foreign secretary on Wednesday the United
States is prepared _ if pushed _ to move its military bases from
that island nation, according to Pentagon officials.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Carlucci went out
of his way during a closed-door meeting with Foreign Secretary Raul
Manglapus to stress America's support for the Philippine government
and President Corazon Aquino.
   But the defense secretary, troubled by an impasse over the
future of the Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base, told
Manglapus the United States was not bluffing over the issue of
monetary compensation ``and that there are other alternatives which
have been found to be militarily and economically feasible,'' said
one source.
   ``The secretary told him we understand the Philippines'
financial problems,'' the official continued, ``but that there are
limits for us, too.
   ``We are pretty well stretched to the edge of our limits here.
There is very little flexibility left. And Carlucci told him that
while it would be extremely unfortunate for both countries, we are
prepared to look elsewhere.''
   The sources characterized the discussions at the Pentagon as
designed to reinforce a message delivered earlier this week by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz by stressing for the first time
the Pentagon ``really is prepared to move those bases if it has
to.''
   ``We don't want to, but we will and more importantly, can,''
added one official.
   The sources said the leading candidate selected by military
planners and Carlucci as an alternative for the bases is Guam, an
island that is farther away from Asia but which offers the
advantage of being a U.S. territory.
   Manglapus came to the Pentagon on Wednesday for one-on-one talks
with Carlucci after consulting with Shultz on Tuesday. Following
his visit to the State Department, he told reporters: ``There has
been nothing to justify my saying that we are closer together.''
   The major issue in the talks is U.S. compensation to the
Philippines for use of the bases. Manglapus has declined to provide
details of the aid figures being discussed, but congressional
sources and reports in the Philippines indicate he is asking for
about $1.2 billion annually over the next two years.
   This would represent a sizeable increase over the $180 million a
year to which the Reagan administration has been committed since
1983. In addition to cash aid, the Philippines also is said to be
seeking trade concessions, debt relief and other ``soft
components,'' as Manglapus described them.
   The administration reportedly has offered $360 million yearly in
1989 and 1990 in addition to food assistance and other concessions
for a total of just under $500 million.
   Shultz said last week the Filipino demands were ``out of
bounds,'' adding that ``we will be patient and we will be
persistent'' in efforts to overcome the impasse.
   Manglapus has argued a substantial aid increase is warranted
partly to correct what he suggests is an historical injustice,
contending the United States used military facilities in the
Philippines for more than 70 years without compensating Filipino
authorities.
   In other countries, he said, the United States has provided aid
immediately after establishing military bases.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Insists North Comply With 5-Month-Old Subpoena</HEAD>

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted
11-8 on Wednesday to insist that former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L.
North comply with a subpoena it issued five months ago demanding
that he produce hundreds of pages of classified diary pages.
   The documents are sought by a Foreign Relations subcommittee
investigating international narcotics trafficking.
   North and his attorney, Brendan L. Sullivan, have resisted
producing the diaries which North maintained as an official on the
staff of the National Security Council. He was fired from that job
amid disclosures he had been involved in the secret sale of U.S.
arms to Iran and in the diversion of part of the proceeds to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, sought the
subpoena after noticing heavily censored references to narcotics in
copies of the diaries obtained by the congressional Iran-Contra
committees.
   He said they were relevant to his panel's investigation because
of references to narcotics, to apparent links to the Contras and to
the investigation itself.
   The full committee issued the subpoena last April 26 on a 17-1
vote.
   On Wednesday, Kerry said the committee had met some of
Sullivan's objections, narrowing the scope of the subpoena to
sections of the diaries containing references relevant to the
subcommittee's probe and not insisting on receiving all 2,048 pages.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., continued to object to the decision to
pursue the subpoena, saying it was unfair when North is facing
trial in U.S. District Court here on charges growing out of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Some senators expressed doubt that the committee can obtain the
subpoenaed documents by the time the 100th Congress adjourns next
month.
   Kerry, urging his colleagues not to accept further delay,
referred to Sullivan and said: ``Delay plays into the hands of a
very clever counselor and plays into the hands of those who want to
see all of this disappear.''

<HEAD>Coalition Cautions That 12 Million At-Risk Youth Threaten US
Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will have a ``soup-kitchen
workforce'' unable to take part in the technological job market of
the future unless it upgrades the critical skills of at least 12
million at-risk youth, according to reports released Wednesday.
   ``If we don't (upgrade their skills) we will continue to
increase the polarization between those at low income levels and
those at the high income levels,'' said Larry Brown, chairman of
the National Youth Employment Coalition.
   He warned that such a situation would add ``pressure put on the
social fabric of this nation which has not been seen since the
early '60s.''
   Brown, who is also president of Washington, D.C.-based 7001
Training & Employment Institute, was one of five representatives
presenting his organization's report at the coalition's press
conference, called to focus attention on ``America's Forgotten
Future: A Close-Up Look at Solving the Problems of At-Risk Children
and Youth.''
   ``At-risk'' youth are those between 14 and 24 years of age who
may be members of low income or welfare families, teenage parents,
dropouts, lack basic educational skills or have criminal records
which place them at risk for education and employment failure, the
coalition said.
   Although each report pinpointed a particular aspect of programs
designed to help youth overcome these social and economic problems,
all agreed that the problem of ill-prepared youth was one that
would come back to haunt the nation.
   Shioghan Nicolau, president of the Hispanic Policy Development
Project in New York, called for a fundamental restructuring of
middle and secondary schools to emphasize job skills and
responsibility early on.
   In ``Too Late To Patch,'' his group provided a basic primer to
successful programs for ``fast-growing '' Hispanic at-risk
populations in New York, Florida, Illinois, Texas and California.
   ``Budget priorities have virtually forced (program operators) to
emphasize the cheaper'' options, Nicolau said, noting the lack of
proper supportive services like day care and one-on-one counseling.
   Psychologist Kenneth B. Clark echoed the consensus of the
experts in a report entitled ``America's Shame, America's Hope: 12
Million Youth At Risk,'' cited at Wednesday meeting.
   ``We could not give the states of this nation a passing grade
for what has been done for youth at-risk up to now. We would have
to hand out an F. _ Still failing but at least beginnng to pay
attention in class,'' Clark's report said.
   As to the ``federal government's stewardship fo the problem we
can think of no approporiate grade _ `Absent' is the school term
that comes most readily to mind, '' the report added.
   ``We have the ways to teach poor kids. We do have the technology
and if we don't find the will, as Dr. Clark suggests, we going to
have a soup-kitchen labor force in a post-industrial economy,''
said George B. Autry, president of MDC, Inc., a non-profit Chappel
Hill, N.C.-based research group which commissioned the Clark study.
   The other reports released included:
   _ ``A Practitioner's Guide: Strategies, Programs and Resources
for Youth Employability Development'' from Public@Private Ventures,
a Philadelphia-based non-profit group which develops, researches
and manages youth training programs.
   _ ``Vanishing Dreams: The Growing Economic Plight of America's
Young Families,'' from the Children's Defense Fund, a youth
advocacy group.
   _ ``Believing Once Again: Solutions Addressing the Plight of
Challenged Youth,'' also from the 7001 Institute.

<HEAD>Anti-Drug Effort Still Beset By Bureaucratic Infighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bureaucratic infighting means the
administrative system being set up by the Customs Service to
oversee the federal government's anti-drug effort won't be the
centralized operation sought by Congress, a congressional watchdog
agency said Wednesday.
   The report by the General Accounting Office led two key senators
to question whether the Customs Service should spend any more money
on the system. Customs has already spent $42 million and is seeking
another $8 million.
   Six federal agencies have a role in the federal government's
increasing efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the
United States.
   Two years ago, as part of an anti-drug bill, Congress ordered
the Customs Service to develop a centralized command-and-control
system to improve coordination among federal agencies.
   For example, the Customs Service and the Coast Guard now operate
separate facilities along the southern U.S. border for overseeing
planes and ships used to track drug traffickers.
   But the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Coast Guard have both
dropped out of the wide-ranging system originally envisioned by the
1986 law, the GAO noted, meaning the intent of the legislation may
not be fulfilled.
   The GAO report also noted that there are increasing
congressional demands to make the Defense Department the chief
coordination agency in the anti-drug effort, which would mean the
Customs program would be outdated.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Investigations
subcommittee, said, ``The GAO study raises serious questions
regarding the adequacy of the Customs program and whether Congress
should continue to fund it.''
   ``The GAO report highlights a series of concerns raised by a
number of senators that the Customs project has been fatally flawed
from its inception,'' said Nunn.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said, ``We were led to believe that this command and
control system would coordinate, not complicate, our drug programs.
We're throwing fuel on a fire that is out of control if we barge
ahead with this system.''
   Customs officials did not immediately return telephone calls
seeking comment. But the GAO report quoted Customs officials as
agreeing with the study's conclusions.

<HEAD>Bureau Signs Contract On Management Of Trust Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs signed a contract
Wednesday to turn over management of $1.8 billion in trust funds to
private management for the first time.
   The new manager, Security Pacific National Bank of Los Angeles,
will take over accounting, receipt and disbursement of funds for
300,000 separate accounts from the bureau and the Treasury.
   The contract runs for a year, but may be renewed annually four
times. If the bank remains manager for five years, it will be paid
$21.2 million. The government would pay about $1 million to convert
its accounting system to the bank's specifications, which will take
about a year.
   To keep on managing the accounts in-house would cost the
government $25 million over the same period, said bureau spokesman
Carl Shaw.
   ``Where we'll really gain is in the electronic transfer of
funds,'' Shaw said.
   Checks being mailed from office to office now can take several
days, during which money is not earning interest. The bank-operated
system should enable receipts to start earning interest much
sooner, Shaw said.
   The bureau may invest trust funds only in government securities
or federally insured accounts in banks and savings and loan
associations. The bank will not make actual investment decisions,
only recommendations to the bureau, which retains legal
responsibility for the investments.
   The bureau had planned to award the contract to Mellon National
Bank of Pittsburgh, but following complaints from tribes that they
had not been adequately consulted and from the Treasury and other
banks that specifications had been too narrowly drawn, the bureau
re-opened competition for the contract in March 1987.

<HEAD>Husband Poisoned By Wife Asks Judge To Free Her</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who was fed rat poison by his wife
begged a judge not to sentence her to prison, but his plea was
ignored by the judge, who gave the woman a five-year sentence.
   ``We've been married 28 years. If I ever needed her, I need her
now. I can't even make it to the bathroom now,'' an ailing James
Crittenden, 46, said Tuesday at the circuit court hearing.
   Nevertheless, Judge Charles Woods sentenced Flora Crittenden,
47, to five years in prison and ordered her to pay restitution,
court costs and $25 to the state victim's compensation fund.
   The judge suspended Mrs. Crittenden's sentence pending a
probation hearing. She was released on the same $20,000 bond she
had been free on since shortly after her arrest in May. No date for
the hearing was set.
   Mrs. Crittenden originally was charged with attempted murder in
the poisoning of her husband, but pleaded guilty to the lesser
charge of second-degree assault in an agreement with prosecutors.
   ``It seemed like a reasonable settlement,'' Dale County District
Attorney David Emery said. ``She did assault him with rat
poisoning. Her husband forgave her before he even got out of the
hospital.''
   Dale County Sheriff Bryant Mixon has said Crittenden, who was
hospitalized following the poisoning, refused to sign an arrest
warrant. Mixon said his department signed the warrant.
   Mixon said Mrs. Crittenden apparently poisoned her husband by
putting arsenic in his food and drinking water.
   Crittenden had been sick for awhile before his wife's arrest. He
now needs a walker to get around.
   Mrs. Crittenden's attorney, Johnny Hardwick, said Crittenden had
suffered a work-related accident before the charges were brought
against his wife. He said it was unclear whether the accident or
poison was responsible for Crittenden's sickness.
   Mixon said his department was notified of the poisoning after
Crittenden's doctor detected a high level of arsenic in him. Mixon
said a possible motive was a life insurance policy on Crittenden
for an unspecified ``substantial amount of money.''

<HEAD>Senate Won't Pass Bill To Seize Land Adjacent To Battlefield Park</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate won't pass a bill for a
``legislative taking'' of land adjacent to the Manassas National
Battlefield Park in suburban Virginia to prevent the construction
of a shopping center, the chairman of the committee involved said
Wednesday.
   The House passed the bill 307-98 on Aug. 10, taking the 542-acre
Williams Center tract and providing up to $30 million in
compensation. Such a seizure of land is rare and leaves to a later
court determination how much the owner should get.
   Prince William County authorities already have approved the
shopping center, which is to be accompanied by office and
residential development on the tract.
   The controversy has galvanized many environmentalists and Civil
War buffs who see desecration in the location of a shopping center
next to the park commemorating the First and Second Battles of
Manassas in the Civil War.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said he intended to vote for the measure and
expected to send it to the floor.
   But the bill violates a Senate rule against bringing
``entitlement'' legislation to the floor outside of the budget
process, and the Budget Committee is unlikely to waive the rule, he
said.
   Sixty senators could vote to set the rule aside, but Johnston
said, ``I frankly don't think it'll pass a 60-vote point of order
at this time in this session.''
   Still, he told his colleagues during a discussion of the bill at
a committee meeting, ``we are at least saying this is a high
priority and this kind of land should not be lost.''
   The ranking Republican, James McClure of Idaho, said the last
``legislative taking,'' a seizure of redwood forest lands in
California in 1980, had been projected to cost $349 million but
would cost $1.4 billion.
   He said land in the Manassas area was now selling for $17 to
$17.50 per square foot, so the entire tract could cost $413 million
at the higher figure.
   McClure noted that the committee had left the tract in private
hands when it enlarged the park in 1980, deciding that it was not
significant enough historically to include in the park.
   ``We made a mistake'' in 1980, said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.,
chairman of the national park subcommittee, in arguing for support
of the House bill.
   ``We have a necessity to understand how we got where we are,''
Bumpers said in arguing for the significance of the tract.
   James McPherson, author of the recent highly praised one-volume
history of the Civil War, ``Battle Cry of Freedom,'' testified at a
subcommittee hearing that the Second Battle of Manassas was the
most significant of the war for the South, Bumpers said.

   Rain continued to drench the Plains on Wednesday, and Gulf Coast
residents were told to begin preparing for high tides in advance of
Hurricane Gilbert.
   Rain showers Wednesday afternoon reached from Nebraska across
Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Wyoming.
   Skies were cloudy over much of New England, the northern Plains,
the northern Rockies and the southern coast of California. Skies
were generally sunny over the remainder of the nation.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
about three-quarters of an inch at Grand Island, Neb., and Dalhart,
Texas.
   Hurricane Gilbert plowed across Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula
toward the Gulf of Mexico coast of Texas at about 15 mph, with
maximum sustained winds of about 160 mph.
   Tropical storm winds extended 250 miles from the center to the
north, and 200 miles from the center to the south.
   Tides up to 4 feet above sea level were possible by sunrise
Thursday on the Texas coast. Galveston County officials recommended
evacuation of Bolivar Peninsula, which has about 3,000 residents
northeast of Galveston Island.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Riverton, Wyo., to 96 degrees at Yuma, Ariz. The low
temperature for the nation Wednesday morning was 23 degrees at
Elko, Nev.
   The national weather forecast for Thursday called for rain
showers in the central Plains, western Iowa and Missouri, the lower
Mississippi Valley and the Florida Panhandle. Cloudy skies were
expected over the upper Mississippi Valley and the remainder of the
northern Plains, the Texas Gulf Coast and the northern Pacific
Coast.
   High temperatures in the 50s were predicted for northern Maine
and 60s in the remainder of New England across inland New York and
Upper Michigan, northeast Minnesota, the central Rockies and the
northern Pacific Coast. Highs in the 90s should extend from the
lower Atlantic Coast across the Gulf of Mexico states, and the
southern Plains, with 70s and 80s elsewhere, except 90s to about
105 degrees in the desert Southwest.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
announced Wednesday that the state finished last fiscal year with a
$67 million surplus.
   The Massachusetts governor said $25 million had been expected
and was already credited to the books for the $11.6 billion fiscal
1989 budget, $26 had to be earmarked under law for a ``rainy day''
account, and the rest may be used to fund some programs that were
conditionally vetoed because of budget problems.
   One critic said Dukakis achieved the surplus by cutting back on
human services spending late in fiscal 1988, which ended June 30.
Another, the Republican House minority leader, said any surplus
would be the product of tax and fee increases, government borrowing
and a ``raid'' on the pension fund.
   Dukakis has campaigned on his record as a fiscal manager.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A bishop and an opposition leader
expressed doubt Wednesday that Haiti's military rulers will live up
to their promise to punish thugs who massacred nine parishioners
and burned down two churches.
   ``We call on God to help us surmount this bloody, ferocious
dictatorship,'' Bishop Willie Romelus of the western town of
Jeremie said on the Roman Catholic Church's Radio Soleil.
   Serge Gilles, co-leader of the leftist Patriotic Unity Bloc,
said Sunday's massacre ``happened under the very nose of the army
and police, and they did not intervene to prevent the bloodshed.''
   The government said Tuesday night it ``regretted'' the massacre
at St. Jean Bosco Church, when two dozen hoodlums killed nine
people at Mass and wounded 77, then burned down the building as
soldiers watched from an army compound across the street.
   Radio Haiti Inter said thugs burst into the state-run general
hospital Tuesday searching for a survivor of the church massacre, a
32-year-old woman, saying they wanted ``to finish her off.''
   The unidentified woman and her daughter, then still in the womb,
were wounded Sunday when an assailant stabbed them with a skewer.
Doctors saved both. The gang left without finding the woman, the
station reported Wednesday.
   Authorities also promised to find and punish those responsible
for burning down another church late Monday night.
   ``It is difficult to have confidence in the promises of the
military government,'' Gilles said.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy's government has issued statements of
regret in the past following mass murders and political
assassinations but no convictions resulted.
   Five men and a woman appeared on state television boasting they
took part in the massacre, which they said was directed at the Rev.
Jean Bertrand Aristide, an outspoken critic of the army. They
threatened ``a heap of corpses'' if Aristide holds future Masses.
   The six made no attempt to hide their identity and spoke on the
government network without apparent fear of arrest or reprisals.
   Romelus, Aristide's uncle and the most radical of Haiti's 10
bishops, said, ``If the leaders of the government are not
responsible shouldn't they have arrested them (the six)
immediately?''
   He said the military government ``deplored and condemned and
promised to arrest only after other countries made their
declarations.''
   The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the
Organization of American States accused the government of allowing
the massacre.
   ``The police stood by during the attacks,'' said a statement
issued by OAS offices in Washington and Port-au-Prince. ``Since
there is a military post very near the church the commission can
only conclude that this attack was perpetrated at least with the
acquiescence of the government.''
   The commission had sent a fact-finding mission to Haiti last
month.
   Namphy returned to power after ousting the 4-month-old civilian
government of President Leslie Manigat on June 19. Namphy
previously headed a junta which ruled this impoverished Caribbean
nation for two years following dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier's
flight into French exile.

<HEAD>Bakker, Former PTL Board Member Disagree Over Who Set Salaries</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with Bakker testimony, lawyer saying Bakker
remains interested in buying back PTL, editing to conform; no
pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY BROOKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker and a former PTL
board member disagreed Wednesday in bankruptcy court over who set
the evangelist's high salary, with Bakker saying the board approved
it and the director saying the board never acted on the matter.
   The dismissed TV preacher was called to the stand by attorneys
for PTL, which is trying to win a $52 million claim against Bakker,
his wife, Tammy, and former top aide David Taggart.
   PTL attorneys want the Bakkers and Taggart to repay money they
say was lost through mismanagement of PTL accounts and unjustified
compensation and benefits. The trial began Monday before U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.
   The ministry has been trying to reorganize in bankruptcy court
since June 1987, three months after Bakker left the ministry amid a
sex and money scandal involving former church secretary Jessica
Hahn. The ministry's debts total more than $130 million.
   Asked by PTL attorney Brad Leggett who decided his 1984 salary
of $228,000, Bakker replied that it was set by the board of
directors.
   ``I have been with Heritage Village Ministries with 15 years and
the board began my salary then and any raises would have been voted
up from that point,'' he said.
   However, earlier Wednesday, Charles H. Cookman, district
superintendent for the Assemblies of God Ministries' North Carolina
area and a member of the PTL board from 1980 to 1987, testified
that the board of directors ``never ruled on salaries. I don't know
who set the salaries.''
   Bakker has been trying to regain control of the evangelical
empire, which includes the PTL television network and the Heritage
USA Christian resort.
   On Wednesday, Bakker attorney Jim Toms said outside court that
Bakker still is interested in buying back PTL, despite the
rejection of his offer last week when he failed to prove he had the
money to back his $172 million bid.
   Toms added, however, ``We're not going to talk about any
financing until we get some money, until we hear a faint rustle.''
   Reynolds has ordered bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton Jr.
to find a buyer for the ministry. On Monday, he filed a report with
Reynolds saying that he cannot recommend a buyer now. He asked
Reynolds to allow him until Sept. 27 to file a motion for sale,
either to a private buyer or at auction.
   In his testimony, Cookman said board meetings were run primarily
by Bakker, with help from the former executive vice president,
Richard Dortch.
   Cookman said it was not until March 1987, when Bakker resigned,
that he became aware of the ministry's troubles. ``I was
astonished,'' he said, to learn the extent of bonuses given to
Bakker and other executives.
   When he first joined the board, Cookman said, he understood
Bakker's salary to be between $35,000 and $40,000 a year. ``In
1986, I asked Richard Dortch what Bakker's salary was, and my
recollection of his reply was $200,000.''
   He testified that in one meeting the issue of compensation for
Taggart was raised, but board members were told, ``That comes under
the administration of PTL, and is not a board matter.''
   Also Wednesday, an IRS auditor testified that because of a lack
of documentation at PTL, he could only assume that some expenses
charged to the ministry by the Bakkers and their top aides were for
personal use.
   Larry Howlett, a Nashville, Tenn.-based auditor of tax-exempt
organizations, testified Tuesday he could find no paperwork to
prove a legitimate business purpose for expenditures including a
personal 300-foot water slide at the Bakkers' Tega Cay home on Lake
Wylie, two Rolls Royce automobiles and hundreds of thousands of
dollars Bakker and others got through PTL accounts.
   Under cross-examination Wednesday by Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis,
Howlett conceded, however, that because of the lack of
documentation, he could only assume the Bakkers and Taggart were
using the cars and other expenditures for no legitimate business
purpose.
   Reynolds also must act on a motion filed by Fairfax Savings and
Loan Corp. of Baltimore, a major PTL creditor, to shut down the
ministry and auction off its assets.
   The bank accused Benton of misleading creditors and the court
about the seriousness of PTL's situation.
   In the motion filed last week, Fairfax, which holds PTL
mortgages totaling $12 million, criticized Benton for failing to
find a buyer for PTL's assets.

   Flood waters receded Wednesday but the
death toll kept climbing, and health officials called for
international shipments of water-treatment chemicals and medicines
to stop a killer epidemic of diarrhea.
   Health Secretary Manzurul Karim on Wednesday said there have
been 319,860 official cases of diarrhea and 168 diarrhea-related
deaths since Aug. 27. On Tuesday, officials reported 283,703
official cases and 150 deaths.
   Karim said pharmaceutical companies were working overtime to
manufacuture medicines to battle the outbreak of diarrhea caused by
floodwaters filled with sewage.
   ``Bangladesh does not need foreign doctors but will welcome
limited quantity of medicines from the friendly countries,'' he
said at a news conference.
   ``Bangladesh needs 75 million water purification tablets out of
which it will produce 25 million units locally. We have instructed
local companies to produce various life-saving drugs in double
shifts,'' he said.
   Mohamed Elnaggar, a World Health Organization representative in
Dhaka, said most cases of diarrhea are not being reported to the
hospitals.
   What is believed to be the worst flooding in Bangladesh history
has caused 1,804 deaths from drowning, snake bites, collapsed
buildings and diarrhea, according to daily reports in Dhaka
newspapers. Officials reports, routinely lower, put the death toll
at 899 as of Wednesday.
   The monsoon flooding has affected more than 30 million people in
three-fourths of this country, which is roughly the size of
Wisconsin.
   The real number is impossible to ascertain, given Bangladesh's
unwieldy bureaucracy and communications that were poor even before
the floods.
   Meanwhile, the Flood Control Center said Wednesday that water
levels in all major rivers were falling fast.
   In Dhaka, authorities were pumping water from the main
commercial district of Motijheel and some residential areas. But
the pumping was causing new flooding in some areas where water had
begun to recede.
   Jay F. Morris, deputy director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, signed an agreement in Dhaka Wednesday
to provide $20 million in wheat to Bangladesh, the U.S. Embassy
said here.
   ``This agreement represents an acceleration of our proposed
level of $60 million for financial year 1989 to provide the
government of Bangladesh needed flexibility to respond to food
shortage that may occur over next few months,'' Morris said in a
statement.
   ``Shipment of remaining $40 million worth of foodgrains will be
determined once the full extent of crop loss due to the flooding is
known,'' he said.
   The United States in the last two weeks committed nearly $154
million in flood aid to Bangladesh for meeting the emergency caused
by the flooding, the statement said.

<TEXT>
   Leonid I. Brezhnev's grandson said in an article
published Wednesday that growing criticism of the former Soviet
leader has turned into a smear campaign that is hurting him and
other family members.
   But a second article by a well-known journalist indicated the
attacks on Brezhnev, centered on the bribery trial of his
son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, is not about to stop.
   The journalist, Fyodor Burlatsky, also shed some light on how
Brezhnev assumed power from Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1964.
   The two articles sharpened the debate over the 1964-1982 period
when Brezhnev was in power. An investigation of the Brezhnev era
has overtaken the re-evaluation of Josef Stalin's repression as the
major historical topic under review in the Soviet press.
   Criticism of previous leaders, under way on a large scale in the
more open atmosphere of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, is
nevertheless traditional in the Soviet system, and often gives
citizens an indirect clue about where the leadership wants to take
the country.
   ``I'm 27 years old, and my independent life is only beginning,
but I already feel that my surname ever more frequently has become
a stumbling block in the most varied situations,'' Andrei Brezhnev
wrote in the weekly Moscow News.
   ``I want to be just like everyone, I am just like everyone, but
many don't want to see anything in me except my surname,'' he said.
   He said much of the current criticism of Brezhnev for bringing
in a period of stagnation and corruption, is justified, but that
his grandfather also was a victim of the political system and is
being unfairly blamed for mistakes of his aides.
   The younger Brezhnev said tales of the family's corrupt and
opulent lifestyle while his grandfather was in office were partly a
result of the lack of information Soviets have about their leaders'
private life, and partly a result of the actions of his aunt,
Brezhnev's daughter Galina, who he described as ``uncontrollable.''
   Churbanov, charged in a trial that opened Sept. 5 with fostering
a huge network of bribery and corruption in the republic of
Uzbekistan, is married to Galina.
   The younger Brezhnev said he went to a normal school and did not
associate with the children of high party officials.
   The sharp criticism of Brezhnev continued Wednesday on the pages
of the authoritative weekly Literary Gazette.
   Burlatsky, who was ousted from his job in the International
Department of the Communist Party Central Committee during
Brezhnev's years, said Brezhnev was a weak man who knew only how to
work the giant party and government apparatus.
   Soviet society must find out ``how it could happen that in such
a difficult period in the history of our motherland, and in the
world's history, that the weakest of all leaders who reached this
position in Soviet, and perhaps in prerevolutionary times, was at
the wheel of management.''
   He said Brezhnev ``cultivated with almost childlike simplicity
the accessories of his cult.''
   He said Brezhnev was a ``master of compromise'' who knew how to
place his supporters in the middle and high levels of the party and
government apparatus.
   Those surrounding Brezhnev ``thirsted only for one thing _ that
this person would live forever _ that's how good things were for
them,'' Burlatsky said.
   He said that Brezhnev was considered a weak and transitional
figure by other party leaders who wanted to get rid of Khrushchev
because of his erratic policies.
   Khrushchev's ouster was orchestrated not by Brezhnev or
conservative party ideology chief Mikhail Suslov, but by former KGB
chief Alexander Shelepin, he said.
   Shelepin led a group that plotted against Khrushchev in meetings
in football stadiums and other unlikely places, he said.
   In a key move, Shelepin successfully changed Khrushchev's
personal guard when he was called back from vacation for the
Central Committee meeting at which he was replaced. That tipped
Khrushchev off, and he tried to stop the flight taking him to
Moscow, but he could not, Burlatsky said.
   Burlatsky said a speech by Alexei Adzhubei, Khrushchev's
son-in-law and editor of the government newspaper Izvestia, served
as impetus to call the meeting.
   He said Adzhubei suggested that Moscow saw no great problems
preventing reunification of East and West Germany. ``The leaders of
... (Communist East Germany) quickly expressed their indignation to
their Soviet colleagues, and this served as the spark that lit the
flame.''
   Burlatsky said Brezhnev was in debt to Khrushchev for advancing
his party career, with Brezhnev moving up steadily in the Ukrainian
party apparatus while Khrushchev was at its head.
   The journalist noted the two leaders' opposite approaches to
policy. He said Khrushchev was bold and took risks while Brezhnev
tried to minimize risk and was very cautious.

   President Daniel arap Moi has ordered park
rangers to shoot poachers on sight, Nairobi newspapers reported
Wednesday.
   ``Officials should inform people about this so that innocent
wananchi (people) do not loiter in the game parks and be caught
unaware,'' Moi said.
   Moi's shoot-on-sight order Tuesday followed the government's
suspension of mining and prospecting in Kenya's 53 national parks
and reserves, a move aimed at stopping poachers who are decimating
this East African nation's elephant herd.
   Studies by the U.N. Environmental Program show that in the last
15 years, the elephant population has dropped 85 percent in Kenya.
An aerial survey in February of the vast Tsavo National Park in
southeastern Kenya found 5,363 elephants, down from an estimated
35,000 in that park alone in 1974.

   Ex-Olympian ice skater Tai Babilonia,
despondent about recent performances, was hospitalized Wednesday
after overdosing on pills, authorities said.
   Paramedics took Miss Babilonia at 9:30 a.m. to Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, where she was treated and discharged almost four
hours later in good condition, hospital spokeswoman Paula Correia
said.
   The type of pills taken and other details weren't disclosed. ``I
am not at liberty to discuss the treatment,'' Miss Correia said.
   The 28-year-old skating star had earlier called her manager to
say she was unhappy about recent performances and that she had
taken a large amount of pills, said Bill Frio, a police spokesman.
   Miss Babilonia's mother was then notified and she notified
paramedics, who picked the skater up at the family's home.
   Despite the conversation with her manager, Frio said
investigators ``are carrying it as an accidental overdose.''
   Detective Bruce Janis said police received a phone call from the
skater's father, retired Los Angeles police Detective Constancio
Babilonia, who said his daughter took the pills accidentally and
that it wasn't a suicide attempt.
   ``Tai Babilonia was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for
treatment of severe stomach cramps due to a reaction to a
non-prescription medication,'' said her publicist Michael Levine.
   He denied it was a suicide attempt and said the police report
about the skater's conversation with her manager was wrong.
   ``Yes, her manager spoke to her this morning, but it was a very
routine conversation,'' Levine said. ``The cops aren't infallible.
They make mistakes.''
   Miss Babilonia and Randy Gardner were favored to win a gold
medal in mixed-pairs figure skating during the 1980 Winter Games in
Lake Placid, N.Y. But Gardner was hampered by a leg injury and they
had to drop out of the competition.
   After the failed Olympic bid, the skating duo signed on with the
Ice Capades and performed with show until 1983, said show spokesman
Tom Abramson. The couple also were featured guest stars at the
Festival on Ice, Knott's Berry Farms' Ice Spectacular and a summer
Ice Show in Lake Tahoe, and appeared in television commercials.

   Sen. Dan Quayle said Wednesday that Soviet
test-launching of an SS-25 mobile intercontinental ballistic
missile showed the United States needs to develop mobile strategic
missiles, something he said would never happen if Democrat Michael
Dukakis is elected president.
   Quayle, the Republican vice presidential nominee who is a member
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was told of the
test by officials of NORAD, the joint U.S.-Canada warning system.
The senator toured a NORAD facility earlier in the day.
   Quayle said he was told that the Soviets launched the SS-25 at
8:50 a.m. EDT from Plesetsk, aimed at Kamchatka, just across the
Bering Sea from Alaska. The Soviets informed the United States of
the launch, he said.
   The Soviets have two types of mobile ICBM missiles, the SS-25
and the SS-24.
   The United States does not presently have mobile
intercontinental ballistic missiles, although two such missiles _
the Midgetman and the Rail Mobile MX _ have been under development.
U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles presently are in concrete
silos buried in the ground.
   Dukakis ``is opposing modernization of our land-based missile
force, while the Soviets are already ahead of us,'' Quayle said.
   ``The governor has already stated that he opposes flight testing
of our missiles so even if he wanted to develop a deterrent, his
flight test ban would prevent us from ensuring that the system
would work,'' Quayle said.
   ``Do we want someone with the governor's views sitting across
the negotiating table from Mr. (Mikhail) Gorbachev?'' he added.
   Dukakis, in a speech in Washington on Wednesday, called the MX,
which he opposes, a ``sitting duck.'' He said, ``The strategic
concept of the Midgetman is sound, but I question the value of
spending $40 billion or $50 billion for 500 additional land-based
missile warheads _ at three times the cost of the same number of
new submarine-based warheads.''
   It was a day in which Quayle continued his attack on Dukakis,
portraying him as weak on defense and foreign policy issues.
   The United State could never have achieved the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty ``if the nuclear freeze
advocated by Michael Dukakis had been adopted,'' Quayle said.
   ``The only thing he would have frozen in place was a dangerous,
destabilizing Soviet medium-range nuclear monopoly in Europe,''
Quayle said.
   Quayle spoke to the Denver Kiwanis-Rotary clubs, where several
hundred protesters staged a noisy demonstration as he arrived. They
carried signs reading ``Bush, Cocaine, Contra'' and ``A Vote for
Quayle is a Vote for Death.''
   In his speech, the second this week to hit Dukakis on defense,
Quayle said the Massachusetts governor did not understand the need
for such weapons as the MX and Midgetman missiles and for the Star
Wars space-based missile defense system.
   The proposed defense shield, said Quayle, ``is a moral, superior
way of defending America.''
   Bush, like the Soviets, understands the importance of a missile
defense system, Quayle said.
   ``George Bush doesn't need a primer on national security.
Neither do I,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle toured NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense
Command center near Colorado Springs. He received a briefing on the
system, which provides a warning in the event of space, missile or
air attack on North America.
   The senator saw a simulated attack by the Soviets and ``how we
would handle that,'' said Gen. John Piotrowski, the NORAD commander.
   The demonstration took place in the steel buildings embedded
under 1,700 feet of granite at Cheyenne Mountain.
   The news media were barred from entering the NORAD complex,
Piotrowski said, because of a federal law which bars political
campaigning at military installations.
   At a rally later at a Colorado Springs airport hangar, Quayle
was heckled by demonstrators who held signs reading ``Students
Unite Against Bush-Quayle'' and who chanted, ``Where was Dan?'' as
he began to speak.
   Gesturing to the protesters, Quayle said, ``Some of those, they
keep walking around in circles. We have a message to talk about.
The people that they support, Michael Dukakis, he doesn't have a
message, he doesn't have any ideas. He doesn't know where to lead
this country.''
   ``He got on a tank, I saw the other day,'' Quayle said. ``Glad
he knows what one looks like.''
   The combination of heckling from the crowd and Dukakis-baiting
by Quayle continued at the New Mexico state fair in Alburquerque,
where Dukakis supporters chanting ``Go Home Quayle,'' shouted
throughout Quayle's speech.
   ``As you listen to this babble over here, you can't help but
think of the Dukakis positions,'' Quayle said. ``They have no
positions. They're loud but they don't have any ideas.
   ``I understand you have a balloon festival coming up the
governor of Massachusetts has a lot of hot air, why don't you
invite him?''

<TEXT>
   Federal and private groups announced Wednesday
that they have begun marshaling forces to send relief to victims of
Hurricane Gilbert in Jamaica, the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and
the Gulf Coast of the United States.
   The United States is $396,000 worth of relief supplies to
Jamaica, the Agency for International Development said. The
supplies include 360 rolls of plastic sheeting, 200 tents, 3,966
water jugs, 18 water tanks, 10 chain saw kits and 9,600 cotton
blankets.
   A portion of the assistance was flown by the military from a
U.S. stockpile in Panama on Wednesday.
   The American Red Cross also announced it had begun sending
emergency supplies to four hurricane ``watch'' districts being
established in Texas as Gilbert made its way toward the U.S. Gulf
Coast.
   The Red Cross said thousands of blankets, cots, comfort kits and
cleanup kits were on their way to Corpus Christi, Harlingen,
Houston and Beaumont, Texas. In addition, volunteers and staff
members have been sent to San Antonio, Texas, and Birmingham, Ala.
which have been established as staging areas for deployment after
the storm hits.
   The organization also said ``watch'' districts set up since last
week during Hurricane Florence in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, La.
were being maintained.
   Partners of the Americas, a group of 60 countries including the
United States and nations in Latin America and the Caribbean
announced it had set up a special relief fund to help the people of
Jamaica and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   The group is seeking cash donations to purchase ``roofing
materials, plastic sheeting, strong soaps, disinfectants,
mattresses, beds and bed linens,'' said William Reese, president of
the group which was established in 1964 as part of the Alliance for
Progress.
   The group is not in a position to accept clothing or food
donations, Reese said.
   Individuals interested in contributing to either relief effort
can do so through their local Red Cross chapter or send donations
to:
   _The American Red Cross, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, D.C. 20013
and
   _Partners of the Americas, Hurricane Gilbert Relief Fund, 1424 K
St., N.W., Suite 700, Washington, D.C. 20005.

   Confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali
Hamadi denied Wednesday that he headed the 1985 TWA hijacking that
claimed the life of a U.S. Navy diver and kept 39 Americans captive
for 17 days.
   Hamadi on Wednesday also accused witnesses of giving false
testimony after some said he gloated over the killing of an
American passenger.
   ``The testimony very often deviates far from the truth,'' Hamadi
told the court. ``I was not the leader of the commando.''
   Flight engineer Benjamin Zimmermann said on Tuesday that Hamadi
pointed with pride to blood stains of murdered U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem on the airplane fuselage.
   Hamadi also said someone else ordered the hijacking. But when
asked by Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger, he refused to name the
man he said ordered it.
   ``The one who gave us the orders came on board after Beirut two,
and took over the command,'' Hamadi said, referring to the second
time the plane landed in Lebanon.
   He said the man spoke English well and boarded the plane with
Shiite Moslem Amal militiamen in Beirut after Stethem was slain.
   TWA Flight 847 pilot John Testrake this week identified Hamadi
as the hijacker who shot Stethem to death. Hamadi has admitted
taking part in the hijacking but has denied killing Stethem.
   The flight from Athens to Rome was hijacked June 14, 1985 and
first diverted to Beirut.
   Witnesses have testified that the situation became more relaxed
on board the plane after the Amal militia arrived. Negotiations
with the hijackers also improved, members of the flight crew said.
   Hamadi also told the court that hand grenades carried by the
hijackers had been defused.
   ``We did not want to blow up the plane. We were worried that
someone would make a wrong move, cause the grenades to fall and
explode and crash the plane,'' Hamadi said.
   Hamadi disputed other testimony that he had gone to the toilet
of the aircraft to get arms smuggled onboard the plane.
   ``The other one went to the toilet. I sat in the window seat and
talked with the first witness,'' Hamadi said, referring to former
hostage Peter Hill.
   Hill testified earlier that he sat next to Hamadi and the other
hijacker and that Hamadi was the one who went for the weapons.
   Witnesses have said they heard the crash of glass when one of
the hijackers went to the toilet to get the weapons.
   They said they believed the weapons had been concealed in a
glass container.
   Examination of glass shards from the plane revealed they did not
contain enough lead to have foiled X-ray security checks, according
to court evidence.
   After briefly answering questions, Hamadi told the court he had
only intended to make a statement and was ``not prepared to answer
any further questions.''
   In other testimony Wednesday, FBI agent Gary Noesner said his
office opened its investigation the day the hijacking began.
   He said the FBI had assembled substantial evidence in the case
but much of it was not released for security reasons. He said
essential evidence was given to West German investigators.
   ``We of course identified Mohammed Hamadi as being one of the
hijackers,'' Noesner said. He added the two other suspects who are
still at large had also been identified and charged in the United
States.
   He said Hamadi was identified by pictures and that suspected
hijackers Hassan Izzedine and Ali Atwa was identified through
pictures and ``a number of reliable sources I cannot disclose.''
   But Noesner told the court that fingerprints found on the TWA
airliner during the investigation were not Hamadi's.
   He said the plane was in poor condition and that attempts were
made to clean it, apparently to get rid of fingerprints and other
evidence.
   The aircraft was returned to Rome from Beirut on Aug. 14, 1985,
nearly two months after the hijacking.
   Other evidence found on the airplane included ``blood stains
near the door ... and AK-47 bullet hulls,'' Noesner said.
   The court recessed until Sept. 20, when another member of the
flight crew is scheduled to testify.

   Israeli leaders on Wednesday spurned the latest
overture by PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who used the Hebrew greeting
``Shana Tova'' to wish Israelis a happy new year on the Jewish
holiday.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, troops shot and
wounded 20 Palestinians, hospital officials said. The army
confirmed 13 casualties among demonstrators.
   Masked assailants in the West Bank city of Nablus stabbed to
death an Arab suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, used
the Hebrew greeting _ the equivalent of Happy New Year _ at a news
conference in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday, a day after he
addressed Socialist members of the European Parliament.
   In his speech, Arafat said the PLO was working toward the
establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and accepted all U.N. resolutions, including 242 and 338
which recognize Israel's right to exist.
   Reaction by top Israelis was icy.
   ``It is a new year's blessing calling for the destruction of the
state of Israel,'' said Moshe Arens, head of the right-wing Likud
bloc's campaign for the Nov. 1 general elections.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-of-center Labor Party
told supporters at a campaign rally in Jerusalem that ``the PLO is
not a partner for talks.''
   ``Seven weeks have gone by since King Hussein'' of Jordan
announced he was cutting his links with the West Bank and handing
over responsibility to the PLO, said Rabin. ``The PLO is incapable
of taking up the challenge, even in words.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, Labor's leader, criticized
European Parliament legislators for receiving Arafat.
   ``All of sudden, they started one more time to fall in love with
the PLO,'' Peres told Israel radio from London, where he met on
Wednesday with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Peres said he was reassured by Mrs. Thatcher. He said she
``objects vigorously to the creation of a Palestinian state in
exile.''
   Palestinian leaders appeared split over Arafat's statements.
   Hathem Abu Ghazale, a prominent PLO supporter in the West Bank,
said, ``Arafat's visit is a Palestinian breakthrough in the
countries where the Zionist movement was born and later developed.''
   But deposed Gaza City Mayor Rashad Shawwa said Arafat was
``running around in empty circles.''
   PLO hardliners and Moslem fundamentalist groups oppose a
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian government-in-exile because
it would imply recognition of Israel.
   Israeli peace activist Abie Nathan, who defied Israeli law to
meet Arafat in Tunis this week, told Israel Television from
Strasbourg the PLO was ready to negotiate peace with Israel.
   ``I believe that today ... we are closer to peace than ever
before,'' Nathan said.
   Palestinian youths on Wednesday stoned Israeli troops and burned
tires in the Gaza Strip refugee camps of Khan Yunis and Shati.
   Troop gunfire wounded nine Palestinians in Khan Yunis and seven
in Shati, including two teen-agers who were in serious condition,
said Arab hospital officials. The army confirmed seven wounded in
Khan Yunis and three in Shati.
   In the West Bank village of Beit Lid near Tulkarem, soldiers
fired to disperse villagers resisting an army raid, an army
official said. Three Palestinians were wounded and several
Palestinians were arrested, he said.
   Another Palestinian was wounded in a clash in the West Bank
village Burquin near Nablus, hospital officials said.
   Assailants dragged 30-year-old Palestinian Adli Thalga from his
Nablus home and stabbed him to death. He allegedly collaborated
with Israeli authorities.
   Seven Palestinians accused of cooperating with Israel have been
killed the Palestinian rebellion began on Dec. 8 in the
Israeli-occupied territories. The uprising has claimed the lives of
265 Palestinians and six Israelis.
   Thalga was the fifth alleged collaborator to be killed in 10
days following a call from Palestinian uprising leaders to ``rid
ourselves of collaborators.''
   Rabin meanwhile attacked proposals raised by some Likud
politicians to annex large parts of the West Bank, saying it would
turn Israel into ``a racist, apartheid state.''
   ``Racism and Judaism don't go together,'' he said.
   But Rabin said Israel would not hand back all lands captured in
the 1967 Middle East war.

   They sleep on the ground after 24
hours or more of potentially deadly work, gobble cold food when
they get the chance, and shower off layers of sweat-streaked dirt
every few days.
   But firefighters say they love their jobs.
   It's action: carving bare-earth control lines with shovels or
bulldozers, dousing flames with hoses, piloting helicopters that
drop water from buckets. It's better than some boring job, they
say, or just sitting around at a fire station.
   And, they add, their efforts are usually appreciated.
   A sign at an entrance to a firefighters' camp at the Nevada
County fairgrounds Wednesday said, ``We Love You Firefighters.''
Red hearts were plastered around the message to nearly 3,000
firefighters who began battling a huge blaze Sunday near this gold
country community 45 miles northeast of Sacramento.
   ``I'm going to make a career out of firefighting,'' said David
McLean, 25, who drives a fire engine during the summer for the
California Department of Forestry. ``I like the outdoors and I like
the action. I love it.''
   McLean and his crew of seasonal firefighters from El Dorado
County were among state forces from throughout central California
that first attacked the ``49er Fire,'' which burned more than
30,000 acres in four days, razing nearly 100 homes.
   ``We worked almost 40 hours straight, from Sunday morning to
Monday night. We ate C-rations when we had the time and finally got
our first hot meal after we were relieved and sent to fire camp,''
said McLean, who is a Santa Cruz carpenter in the off-season.
   ``Then I got my first shower in a couple days,'' he said.
``After that long, it's always the best shower of your life.''
   Like most others at the sprawling camp, McLean and his crew
bedded down in paper sleeping bags on the ground, with clothing for
pillows.
   Among those sprawled across the grass and draped on fire trucks
from state, federal and local agencies were plenty of female
firefighters.
   Forestry department seasonal firefighter Talley Tarris, 23, of
Sacramento, said she's often asked why a woman would want to battle
flames.
   ``I like being grimy and not sleeping,'' she said, laughing.
   ``We're one big happy family,'' Tarris added.
   Not everyone fighting fires has it as rough as the ground troops.
   The crews that operate helicopters, which carry water in buckets
to douse hot spots, were based next to the firefighters' camp but
slept 30 miles away in a motel so they would be properly rested.
   Even those crews don't always take advantage of the
comparatively posh arrangement, however.
   ``Sometimes it's more of a pain to go in (to a motel) than it's
worth,'' said pilot Jim Ramage of Redding. ``Then we just sleep on
the ground, too.''

<TEXT>
   CBS' weekly news show ``48 Hours'' is doing a
quick switch Thursday to live coverage of Hurricane Gilbert rather
than the previously planned taped report on infertility.
   The storm gave ``48 Hours'' a chance to do what it was
originally designed to do _ provide an instant prime-time platform
for a breaking news story.
   CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman said Dan Rather would anchor the
broadcast that will include reports from 14 correspondents
hurriedly dispatched to the Caribbean, where the storm has already
caused devastation and killed at least 11 people in Jamaica; to
Mexico, which was being battered by 160 mph winds on Wednesday; and
across the gulf coast areas of the United States, which were
bracing for the arrival of the storm, described as one of the
strongest ever.
   Eight correspondents were sent to Texas, including Harry Smith
to co-anchor ``CBS This Morning'' from Galveston, Goodman said.

<HEAD>Group Claims American Who Escaped Abductors Was CIA Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little-known group claimed Wednesday
that an American who escaped abduction in east Lebanon this week
was a CIA agent and that he was freed intentionally.
   Lebanon radio and U.S. officials have said Kenneth P. Wells, 25,
was an American engineer who overpowered his captors after he was
kidnapped on Sunday. He reportely works in Saudi Arabia for Litton
Industries and holds a black belt in karate.
   The group, calling itself the National Progressive Alliance,
claimed it captured Wells because he was on an espionage mission
and then released him. The claims were in a note delivered to the
west Beirut office of the Italian ANSA news agency and were
accompanied by photos of Wells' U.S. driver's license and his Saudi
Arabian work permit.
   It was the first known statement from the previously unheard of
group. An ANSA employee said the note was found in a white envelope
left at the doorstep of the agency office after someone rang the
doorbell and left.
   Wells was abducted briefly with his new Shiite Moslem bride,
Nadia Haydar Sharafeddine, shortly after the couple wed Sunday in
east Lebanon's ancient city of Baalbek.
   But reports varied as to how the couple gained freedom.
   Lebanese press reports Monday said Wells used karate to disarm
his captives and escape.
   Syrian government sources said the Syrian troops who control
east Lebanon's Bekaa valley rescued the couple after a nightlong
search and took them to the Syrian capital of Damascus, where they
were turned over to the U.S. Embassy.
   ``In recent days, CIA Col. Kenneth Paul Wells sneaked into the
territory of our beloved country on an open spying mission for a
whole month under the pretext of marrying a Lebanese,'' said the
statement from the group.
   ``Our courageous strugglers, however, were alert. They chased
him, arrested him, interrogated him and warned him to leave Lebanon
at once. Then they freed him, hoping that the Americans will get
the message that we emphatically reject their overt interference in
our internal affairs,'' the statement added.
   It accused the United States of ``harboring animosity to our
nationalist causes and supporting the enemies of our people and the
Arab nation.''
   The statement also expressed support for Syrian President Hafez
Assad.
   The language of the statement suggests the group behind it may
be leftist rather than the pro-Iranian Shiite extremists believed
to be holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Nine Americans are among the hostages, including Terry Anderson,
40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
Anderson, the longest held of all the hostages, was abducted March
16, 1985 in Beirut.
   The photo with the statement was of a driver's license issued in
Bremerton, Wash., and Wells' work permit, issued by the Saudi
Ministry of Defense and Aviation. It listed him as a maintenance
technician and is valid until June 29, 1989.

   Retired Milwaukee Roman Catholic Archbishop
William Cousins died Wednesday from complications from pneumonia,
church officials said. He was 86.
   Cousins also had been suffering from brain cancer, said Gregory
Bell, spokesman for the archdiocese.
   ``Since coming to the archdiocese as his successor in 1977, I
have held William Cousins in highest esteem,'' said Archbishop
Rembert G. Weakland. ``His gentleness, humility and concern for
people have been an inspiration to all who knew him.
   Cousins, archbishop in Milwaukee from 1959 through 1977, died at
the St. Anne's Home for the Elderly, where he lived. He had been
hospitalized at St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was treated for
pneumonia until late last week.
   In mid-August, he fell at St. Anne's and injured his head. He
was hospitalized at that time and the brain tumor was discovered.
He later returned to St. Anne's, but was re-admitted when he
developed pneumonia Sept. 5.
   A native of Chicago, Cousins was auxilliary bishop there from
1949-52. He was bishop of Peoria, Ill. from 1952-59.

   Several thousand people Wednesday evacuated the marshy,
flood-prone coast of Texas and Louisiana as Hurricane Gilbert
churned into the Gulf of Mexico packing twice the power of last
week's Hurricane Florence.
   ``This is very, very serious,'' said Wendell Curole, hurricane
coordinator for LaFourche Parish on the Louisiana coast. ``Gilbert
is a killer storm, something a lot of people have never
experienced, even in this area.''
   Gilbert, already blamed for at least 11 deaths in the Caribbean,
was on a path toward Texas Wednesday afternoon, forecasters said as
the National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the
state's entire coastline. But with the unpredictable storm three
days away, authorities met to review evacuation plans across
hundreds of miles from the southern tip of Texas to New Orleans.
   On the Bolivar Peninsula outside Galveston Bay, beachgoers and
about 3,000 residents were urged to leave by sundown and most were
cooperating, said Police Chief Farris Collier of Crystal Beach.
   The 1,600 students of the University of Texas Medical Branch on
Galveston Island and about 200 patients also were being evacuated,
said spokeswoman Leann Teymour.
   The Army was setting up a ``crisis action center'' in Washington
to coordinate dispatching active-duty military personnel and
equipment from Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, and possibly Fort Bliss
in El Paso, to assist with evacuations, said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas.
   Andy Valence, mayor of the barrier island town of Grand Isle,
La., about 80 miles south of New Orleans, ordered a general
evacuation of the island's 2,100 residents and visitors.
   Mississippi's Gulf Coast residents kept officials busy answering
phone calls about Gilbert's path.
   ``I think people are concerned, particularly after the close
call with Hurricane Florence last week,'' said Dusty Perkins,
public information officer for the Jackson-based Mississippi
Emergency Management Agency.
   Tampa Bay area officials, still mopping up from four days of
torrential rains last week, worried that Florida's central Gulf
Coast communities were especially vulnerable to Gilbert.
   The ground remained water-logged, said Bob Anderson, Sarasota
County's deputy director of emergency management, and floodwaters
blocked the only two roads from Manatee County's barrier islands
and other evacuation routes.
   Gilbert is a much larger and more dangerous storm than Florence,
which hit southeastern Louisiana Friday night, flooding roads and
knocking down power lines but doing little major damage.
   ``You've got tropical gale force winds all the way out 250
miles'' from the eye of the hurricane, said Bruce Piercy of the
National Weather Service in Miami.
   Evacuations started earlier this week, when oil companies used
helicopters and crew boats to take an estimated 10,000 workers from
offshore rigs.
   More evacuation orders were likely Thursday morning, even if the
storm's path remains uncertain, authorities said.
   ``You cannot evacuate people at night and you can't evacuate
people when the winds and rain have already started,'' said Port
Arthur, Texas, police Lt. B.D. Spradlin.
   Grocery and hardware stores were swamped with shoppers and
lumber and water supplies were reported in short supply throughout
the region.
   New Orleans residents lined up 10 to 15 deep at check out lanes
in one hardware store where plywood for covering windows was the
hot selling item.
   A caravan of cattle trucks jammed a two-lane road out of coastal
Cameron Parish, La., where purebreds graze in the lush marshland.
   In Corpus Christi, Texas, school was canceled for the rest of
the week. In the nearby beach resort of Port Aransas, officials
handed out emergency passes to residents leaving town, to control
access and prevent looting in the event of a disaster.
   Most of the damage would be to homes and low-rise buildings,
which are generally designed to withstand winds of up to 90-100
mph, said Kishor Mehta, president of the Wind Engineering Research
Council and an associate at Texas Tech University's Institute for
Disaster Research.
   ``Gilbert could easily cause damage in the neighborhood of $5
billion to $7 billion if it hits the right place,'' Mehta said.
   U-Haul Marketing Co. President Alan Kirkhart described the scene
at the self-service rental center in Corpus Christi where his
office is located.
   ``It's almost like a mass panic situation,'' Kirkhart said. ``We
have so many people calling and coming in here that we had to start
a waiting list, and it keeps growing before we can get more
equipment in.''
   Because of a shortage of lumber, he said, some Corpus Christi
residents have driven as far as Austin and San Antonio to rent
trucks and trailers, bringing plywood back with them to board up
homes prior to evacuating.

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday
wished Israel ``Happy New Year'' in Hebrew, but Israeli officials
dismissed it as a public relations ploy.
   Arafat also got a message from another quarter Wednesday _ King
Hussein of Jordan. Hussein said that since his kingdom cut ties
with the Israeli-occupied West Bank on July 30, it is up to the
Palestinians to solve their own problems and they have no one to
blame but themselves if they fail.
   Arafat, addressing Abie Nathan, a controversial Israeli radio
personality and peace crusader, said at a news conference earlier
Wednesday:
   ``I ask you to tell all Israelis and ... all Jews `Shana Tova'
on this occasion of the Jewish New Year.
   ``When I say Shana Tova, I mean ... in particular a peaceful New
Year,'' said the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
``A peaceful New Year for all of our children, for all of our
peoples, for the whole of the Arab region.''
   Jews throughout the world at sundown Tuesday ended celebrations
ushering in Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year.
   Speaking in Arabic through interpreters, Arafat addressed
reporters on the last day of a two-day visit to the European
Parliament at the invitation of the body's Socialist group.
   Arafat said the willingness of European and other governments to
recognize a provisional Palestinian government on the West Bank
would influence a decision to establish such a government.
   He urged the United States to be ``more fair'' towards the
Palestinians.
   ``The United States has to stand for justice and fairness and
should not just think of electoral considerations,'' he said.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Arafat's New Year greeting was a ``stunt.''
   ``It's very nice to say `Shana Tova' in front of a group of
journalists, but it would be more constructive if in his speech
yesterday there were some concrete change in policy,'' the official
said.
   He was referring to a meeting Tuesday in which Arafat told the
European Parliament's socialists that Jordan's decision to cut its
ties to the West Bank would pave the way for an independent
Palestinian state.
   Israeli officials reject such a state.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
said Arafat's gesture would not change the right-wing Likud Party's
opposition to holding talks with the PLO.
   ``We will not be misled by the lip service of Mr. Arafat and
seeming gestures like wishing `Shana Tova' to our people,'' Ahimeir
said.
   Arafat said the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, will make a final decision next month on a
provisional government or place the occupied territories under U.N.
trusteeship.
   King Hussein's remarks came during a taped interview with the
``World Monitor'' television program in London.
   In the interview, broadcast Wednesday and monitored in Boston,
Hussein said he did not believe a ``Jordanian option'' now existed
in dealing with the Palestinian question.
   The monarch said that while Jordan remained ``committed ... to
the cause of a just and durable peace ... as far as the Palestinian
dimension is concerned, the Palestinian problem is in the hands of
the Palestinians.''
   He said he hoped that the Israelis now ``would realize that
there has to be a facing of reality and ... come up with their
contribution for the establishment of a just and good peace in the
area.''
   Hussein said Jordan would attend an international Middle East
peace conference only if asked to do so by the PLO _ ``and we'll
have to look at it then.''
   When asked if he thought whether Arafat's organization was
moving in the right direction, Hussein replied, ``Well, there is
certainly no other quarter to blame if they fail to do so.''
   He said, ``The PLO claims to be the sole legitimate
representative (of the Palestinian people) and I believe it's going
to be up to it to prove that this is the case ... Ideally it should
be a simultaneous kind of recognition: Israel recognizing the
Palestinians and their rights on their soil, and ... the
Palestinians acting in a way that would recognize Israel's right to
exist on its soil.''
   He said that if the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands
continues to a point when all hope is lost, ``then it's downhill
and into an abyss ... nobody can forecast what can happen.''

   South African police Wednesday attacked
hijackers holding a busload of pilgrims going to see Pope John Paul
II and said three hijackers and a young woman hostage were killed
during the rescue.
   Eleven passengers were wounded, the remainder were freed and a
fourth hijacker was arrested, South African police headquarters
said.
   Lesotho government officials said 71 hostages were in the bus.
   The military government of Lesotho, a black kingdom that lies
inside South Africa's borders, requested South African help in
handling the hijacking.
   There was no immediate government statement on the shootout.
   Police said the shootout took place when the hijackers tried to
drive the bus through the closed gates of the British High
Commission, or embassy, in Maseru.
   Reporters were barred from the area at the time of the shootout,
but later they saw the bus, its windows shot out, lying wrecked in
the high commission courtyard just inside the gate.
   South African police said officers returned fire after the
hijackers began shooting.
   Police said the hostage casualties were ``apparently caused by
the wild firing of the hijackers.'' They said no policemen were
injured.
   The shooting broke out about 20 minutes after the pope arrived
in Maseru, eight hours behind schedule. The hijackers earlier
demanded to meet with the pope and Lesotho's king, Moshoeshoe II, a
government official said.
   After nightfall, gunfire and explosions were heard at the site
where the bus was parked, and flares lit up the sky.
   Reporters were blocked from getting close enough to the scene to
see the shootout, but they saw ambulances taking casualties to a
hospital.
   Police ordered journalists at the scene to disperse and then
chased them away with whips.
   The pope arrived in this mountain kingdom after an overland
journey from Johannesburg, where bad weather forced his plane to
make an unscheduled landing. John Paul met Foreign Minister Pik
Botha at the airport and was briefed about the hijacking before
leaving for Lesotho.
   State-run Lesotho Radio said there were about 70 hostages,
including eight nuns, 36 children, 16 women and 10 men.
   One nun is from Canada, and the rest of the hostages are from
Lesotho, said Tom Thabane, secretary for Lesotho's six-man ruling
military council.
   One man escaped Wednesday from the bus.
   Armed security forces from both Lesotho and South Africa
surrounded the bus. Botha said Lesotho authorities had asked for
help with security and that South African personnel were ``in
attendance to render advice.''
   Thabane said the hijackers belonged to the guerrilla Lesotho
Liberation Army. He said the government ``has no intention of
meeting the demands of terrorists.''
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said a man
claiming to be a spokesman for the guerrilla group telephoned its
Bloemfontein, South Africa, office and denied responsibility for
the hijacking.
   The four hijackers posed as pilgrims when they boarded the bus
Tuesday at the start of its journey from rural Lesotho, said police
commissioner James Dingiswayo. They then took over the bus,
announced they were from the Lesotho Liberation Army, and said
anyone who resisted would be killed, he said.
   Lesotho Radio said the hijackers were armed with an automatic
rifle, a pistol and two grenades. The radio said the hijackers had
gone to the British mission because Britain, the former colonial
power in Lesotho, was training the country's army and police force.
Their request to meet High Commissioner John Edwards was refused.
   The radio said the hijackers asked Wednesday that a Catholic
priest be taken to the bus. Unofficial sources said they believed
the priest would open negotiations between the hijackers and
Lesotho's military rulers.
   About 100 soldiers and police set up roadblocks with armored
cars and kept spectators four blocks away.
   Gervase Chevasse, deputy British high commissioner, said the bus
pulled up outside the high commission Tuesday evening. He said the
hijackers asked to enter the compound but were rebuffed.
   The Lesotho Liberation Army was opposed to the leftist
government of the late Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan. Several
bombings and killings were blamed on the group, which reportedly
had South African backing.
   The guerrillas left the mountain kingdom after a January 1986
coup deposed Jonathan and installed a military government more
favorable to South Africa. They reportedly have been seeking to
restore relations with the military rulers.
   A nun at the Papal Visit Office, Sister Rita Brassard, said the
bus came from Quacha's Nek, a remote town in southern Lesotho. The
country is surrounded by South Africa.
   Lesotho, a nation of about 1.6 million people, is officially a
constitutional monarchy but is ruled by the military council in
consultation with the king. Lesotho achieved independence from
Britain in 1966.

   Yoko Ono, widow of slain rock star John Lennon,
dismissed author Albert Goldman's controversial version of the
couple's life together and apart as ``totally fiction'' Wednesday
in a nationally broadcast radio show.
   ``These people in this book are not us. It's not John and me,''
Ono said in her first broadcast comments on ``The Lives of John
Lennon'' biography. `` It's unfair he's been assaulted and can't
hit back.''
   The rare appearance Wednesday night by Ono was prompted by
Goldman's 719-page biography of the ex-Beatle which presents him as
an anorexic, bisexual, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his
wife.
   Ono doesn't fare much better: Goldman presents her as a
gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of Lennon's death and
had several affairs while they were married. Goldman also charges
she was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in
Japan and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon.
   Ono denied virtually all of these charges, and countered through
taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman's
book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.
   ``For some reason this book is attempting to rob both John and I
of the basic human dignity that we're entitled to,'' she said
shortly after the broadcast opened with Lennon's song ``Gimme Some
Truth.''
   ``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license. I don't
see John in there. ... It's a very dramatically described
something, but it's not about John,'' said Ono. ``It's totally
fiction.''
   The one-hour broadcast was taped Aug. 28 at the Dakota, where
the Lennons lived _ and Yoko still lives _ in Manhattan. The
broadcast coincides with the book's official release date, which
was also on Wednesday.
   Lennon was fatally shot by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota
on Dec. 8, 1980.
   The Ono interview was broadcast nationwide via the Westwood One
Network; spokeswoman Laurie Wilde said a total number of the
stations picking up the broadcast was not available.
   Appearing with Ono were Lennon's sons, Julian and Sean. Ono is
interviewed by long-time associate Elliot Mintz, described in
Goldman's book as a spy for Yoko.
   ``It is for one, very upsetting, but most of all it is lies,
untruths ... The whole thing is just sickening,'' said Julian, who
also denied Goldman's stories about Lennon as a terrifying father.
   Mintz read excerpts from the Goldman book to Yoko, who then
responded to the allegations made by the author point by point. She
denied Lennon was a homosexual; denied he was using drugs while
living at the Dakota with his son, Sean; denied he had become a
reclusive rock 'n' roll Howard Hughes.
   She did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late
1970s, but rejected Goldman's assertion that she had a
$5,000-a-week habit.
   The book already has drawn angry responses from friends of
Lennon and Ono; McCartney, who denied one anecdote involving a
violent Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a
boycott of the book.
   After Ono's rebuttal, listeners were invited to dial 900
telephone numbers to vote on whether the Goldman book is an
accurate portrayal of the Lennons' life. Results were not expected
until Thursday.
   Goldman, who conducted more than 1,200 interviews for his Lennon
book, has previously written controversial biographies of comedian
Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Blues in the Night' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's hard to get through the night when your man
has done you wrong and then gone. So wail the three lonely ladies
of ``Blues in the Night,'' a minor musical meditation on the blues
that opened Wednesday at off-Broadway's Minetta Lane Theater.
   The show is a recast, slightly revised revival of the musical
revue that had a 53-performance run on Broadway in 1982. This new
version had some success in London before resurfacing in New York
with a cast that includes Brenda Pressley, Leilani Jones and, from
the British production, Carol Woods.
   Despite the classy performers, it's difficult to work up much
enthusiasm for the show. ``Blues in the Night'' is a strange,
anonymous musical with a one-note message and characters that
rarely connect with each other, much less the audience.
   Its women, worn down by men and by life, are identified only as
the lady from the road, the woman of the world and the girl with a
date. They occupy separate rooms in a cheap hotel in some unknown
city. The time is the late 1930s and the hour, of course, is after
midnight.
   The songs are distinctive, most of them well-known classics, but
the themes they express are basically the same. The numbers,
expertly played by a five-piece band perched above the hotel
setting, usually fall into two categories. There's the bluesy
lament for all those men who got away, and dirty, double-entendre
ditties like ``Kitchen Man'' or ``Take Me for a Buggy Ride,''
performed with gusto by the formidable Miss Woods.
   Each member of the cast _ including Lawrence Hamilton as the
evening's generic man _ gets a song or two in which they shine.
Miss Woods pretty much tears down the place with Bessie Smith's
``Wasted Life Blues,'' hitting an intensity that's rarely matched
by the rest of the production. The singer also sasses her way
through a vaudeville number called ``New Orleans Hop Scop Blues''
that demonstrates her Olympic-class sense of timing.
   As the all-purpose woman of the world, the cool Miss Pressley is
a revelation. A sleek, sexy songstress, she projects elegance and
high style. She can move too, particularly in the old Benny Goodman
number ``Stompin' at the Savoy'' and in a wild, defiant ``Take It
Right Back'' that concludes the first act.
   Miss Jones, as the stereotypical girl on a date, has a harder
time because she has the least interesting songs, particularly a
bland version of ``Willow Weep for Me.'' When she is allowed to
torch her material, particularly a song like ``Reckless Blues,''
the woman can sizzle.
   Hamilton's role is even less defined. He wanders in and out of
these melodic tribulations. Occasionally the performer even
comments on these down-and-out dames, particularly in a sardonic
number ``Wild Women Don't Have the Blues'' or on himself in a song
like Duke Ellington's ``I'm Just a Lucky So-and-So.''
   Sheldon Epps, who created and directed the show, has boxed the
musical into a corner. The songs pile on top of each other,
allowing for little emotional variation. Their sheer number gives
the evening the blues.
   ``Blues in the Night'' is best savored for the individual star
turns. Taken as a full evening of theater, the production proves to
be a tad wearyin'.

   A 24-year-old artist from Arkansas was shot to
death Wednesday near the campus of an art institute in Brooklyn
where she came to study a week ago.
   Judith Anne Wrappe of Little Rock was shot at least once in the
chest as she struggled with a gunman who had demanded her purse
while she was walking home about 1 a.m., said police Deputy
Inspector Charles Prestia.
   Ms. Wrappe arrived in New York City last Wednesday and enrolled
for her first semester at the Pratt Institute to pursue a masters
degree in fine arts.
   The prestigious school's campus sits amid historic mansions,
renovated town houses and middle-class apartment towers, but it
also adjoins Bedford-Stuyvesant, a predominantly poor neighborhood
with a high rate of violent crime.
   Ms. Wrappe spent the summer with a brother in Washington, D.C.,
working three jobs to save money for school, her mother said.
   ``Judith was just pursuing her dream,'' of studying art in New
York, said her mother, Sue Wrape, in a tearful telephone interview.
   Ms. Wrappe, a 1987 Notre Dame graduate who spelled her name
differently from her parents, had just finished her first night
working as a waitress at a Manhattan restaurant, said manager Mark
Shay.
   Detectives believe she took the subway to Brooklyn and was one
block away from the apartment she had rented with three other
students when she was approached, Prestia said.
   ``There was some kind of a struggle between the fellow and the
victim, she had shouted out `Leave me alone,' when he fired one
shot, hit her in the chest, and escaped with the handbag,'' Prestia
said.
   During the commotion, a resident of a nearby building had yelled
out the window at the gunman to `Leave her alone,''' Prestia added.
``It was just shortly after that that he fired the shot.''
   The handbag was recovered nearby, and it was not known if
anything was taken.
   Shay said he hired the student artist Monday. During her first
shift, ``she did mention to someone here that it was a culture
shock moving from Arkansas to New York City,'' the restaurant
manager said.
   ``It's embarrassing as a New Yorker to have someone come from
out of state and meet an untimely death at a young age,'' Shay
said. ``It doesn't say much for New York City to the people of
Arkansas.''
   Ms. Wrappe is survived by her mother, and father, Jarrell V.
Wrape, and four brothers and a sister, who ranged in age from 22 to
32 years of age.

<HEAD>Israel, Hungary Agree To Restore Diplomatic Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel and Hungary agreed Wednesday to
gradually restore diplomatic ties that were severed 21 years ago by
the Eastern European nation, Israeli media reported.
   The agreement came after a meeting between Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Hungarian Prime Minister Karoly Grosz
in Budapest, Israel radio and television said.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir, reached at his Tel Aviv home,
refused comment on the reports. Shamir arrived in Budapest
Wednesday.
   Israel television said Shamir and Grosz agreed in principle to
the gradual restoration of ties, but did not set a timetable for
upgrading diplomatic representation.
   Hungary, along with all other Soviet bloc countries except
Romania, severed ties with Israel after the 1967 Middle East war in
which Israel captured lands of the bloc's Arab allies.
   In the past two years, the Soviet Union and some of its allies
sought improved relations with Israel. Israel and the Soviet Union
have exchanged consular delegations.
   Israel and Hungary resumed low-level diplomatic ties last year,
and opened interest sections, the lowest form of diplomatic
representation, in Budapest and Tel Aviv in March.
   In May, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres made a surprise
visit to Hungary, and said the Hungarian government wanted to
expand economic ties with the Jewish state. In 1986, trade between
the two countries totaled about $22 million.
   Imre Miklos, Hungary's state secretary for church affairs, made
a five-day visit to Israel last week and met with Shamir.
   After his return to Hungary, Miklos said Shamir ``reinforced
Israel's interest in further developing relations with Hungary and
said my visit reflected an ongoing improvement in Hungarian-Israeli
relations.''
   He added, ``He (Shamir) could see no reason to prevent the
development of relations in all fields, including the diplomatic
one.''
   Shamir's private two-day tour of Hungary is the first visit by
an Israeli prime minister to a Soviet bloc country other than
Romania since 1967.
   On Thursday, Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, was
scheduled to meet with Jewish leaders and visit a synagogue in
Budapest. About 80,000 Jews live in Hungary and about 240,000 Jews
of Hungarian origin live in Israel.
   Also Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Sidney Thomas Weinstein, U.S. deputy
chief of staff, ended a three-day unofficial visit to Hungary to
discuss ways to improve military cooperation between the two
countries, Hungarian state television reported.
   Weinstein, reportedly the highest-ranking American army officer
to visit the Warsaw Pact country, held talks with Lt. Gen. Ferenc
Szucs, deputy chief of staff of the Hungarian People's Army and met
with Lt. Gen. Jozsef Pacsek, chief of staff and deputy defense
minister, the report said.
   According to Hungarian television, Weinstein ``inquired about
the Hungarian defense doctrine and (conferred on) possibilities to
further develop ties between the armies of the two countries.''
   ``With the political improvement between (Hungary and the United
States) possibilities have opened up for better (military) ties''
the television report said, without further elaboration.

   Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo remained in the lead
by a slim margin Wednesday as the recount continued of ballots cast
in Delaware's Democratic U.S. Senate primary race.
   New Castle County election officials said they would announce
results Thursday.
   ``It's a very tedious process, step-by-step, vote-by-vote,''
said Jack Markell, Woo's deputy campaign manager and a recount
observer. He said he expected the counting of ballots to go into
the early morning.
   Woo's opponent, Samuel S. Beard, was unavailable for comment,
said staff member aide Nancy Leonard.
   ``He's out,'' Ms. Leonard said. ``And I hope he's having a good
time.''
   After recounts in Delaware's other two counties, results did not
change from earlier certified ballots that gave Woo an 88-vote lead
over Beard.
   The recount was requested by both candidates on Monday after it
was discovered a clerical error gave Beard 2,800 votes too many.
   Beard had claimed victory after Saturday's primary, but found
himself trailing after the mistake was found and votes were counted
from nine precincts that had not reported immediately after the
polls closed.
   Woo and Beard are seeking the party's nomination for the right
to challenge Republican Sen. William V. Roth Jr. in the November
election. Roth did not have a primary challenger.
   Beard thought he had won with 22,418 votes to Woo's 19,624.
   By Monday night, the unofficial statewide tally showed Beard
with 20,133 to Woo's 20,221.
   The 2,800-vote mistake occurred in the 23rd representative
district in New Castle County, where about 280 Democrats are
registered. Beard received 28 votes there, but the votes were
recorded as 2,828 in the computer at the county's department of
elections, according to the county elections director.
   Woo, 51, is a physics professor at the University of Delaware,
and was elected elected lieutenant governor four years ago. Beard,
49, has been chairman for job creation commissions under the past
four presidents.

   Jamaican-Americans rallied quickly to their hurricane-devastated
homeland's aid, and hundreds of doctors and nurses and tons of
supplies Wednesday waited for clearance to fly to the Caribbean
nation.
   In the New York area, home to the nation's largest Jamaican
community, a Brooklyn health clinic began accepting food, clothing
and bedding for shipment to Jamaica, and several local Caribbean
groups set up relief funds.
   Dozens of the 50,000 to 60,000 Jamaicans living in South Florida
flocked to the Jamaican Consulate in Miami, waiting nervously for
word of conditions back home. Others staffed makeshift relief
supply centers, gathering tons of food, medicine, clothing, and
building materials.
   Air Jamaica as well as U.S. carriers Midway Airlines and Eastern
Airlines promised to fly supplies to Jamaica for free. But word of
the wreckage Hurricane Gilbert left in its aftermath made islanders
doubt any relief effort would bring their country back.
   ``Kingston was beautiful. Now they can't even recognize it,''
said Vincent Clive Kirkland, waiting for the chance to bring food
and medicine to his family in St. Mary, Jamaica.
   ``I almost want to laugh,'' Kirkland said. ``It's something you
can't believe but you just have to accept it. It don't make sense
to cry.''
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga told his nation Gilbert was the
island's worst natural disaster ever.
   The Jamaican community of South Florida, which puts on reggae
music festivals and has its own clubs and radio shows, often is
overshadowed by larger Latin American communities here. But the
community is closely knit and maintains strong interest in its
homeland, Evans said.
   ``They did not wait for the storm to hit before they began
organizing themselves and when they met with consul general they
already had things under way. The response has been marvelous. It's
always so where our country is concerned,'' said Lancelot Evans,
the consulate's information officer.
   Evans added that the Cuban community also is contributing to the
relief effort, and Spanish-language radio stations broadcast
appeals for help.
   A Telex from the Jamaican government said blankets, sheets,
cots, tents, medical supplies, water, and nonperishable items are
badly needed.
   Joanne Gonzalez, a spokeswoman in Fort Lauderdale for the
Jamaican United Relief Assocation, said hundreds of doctors and
nurses were ready to travel to Jamaica as soon as the government
requested medical assistance.
   Church World Service, the relief division of the National
Council of Churches, said in a statement that it had already
provided $55,000, and was asking member churches to raise an
additional $100,000.
   The Agency for International Development said the federal
government was sending relief supplies totaling $396,000 by
military aircraft from Panama. The supplies include 360 rolls of
plastic sheeting, 200 tents, 3,966 water jugs, 18 water tanks, 10
chain saw kits and 9,600 cotton blankets.
   Partners of the Americas, a group of 60 countries including the
United States and nations in Latin America and the Caribbean
announced it had set up a relief fund to help the people of Jamaica
and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   ``Jamaica is not like America. People do not have insurance. It
will all be their expense,'' Kirkland said. ``If there's any help
the United States can give, we're going to need it.''
   The Caribbean Action Lobby, an organization encompassing
numerous groups of Caribbean immigrants, began drawing up plans for
a ``major fund-raising event'' _ as yet unspecified, said its New
York regional president, Dr. Waldaba Stewart.
   A hurricane relief task force from New York's Jamaican
community, estimated at 300,000 to 600,000 people and concentrated
in Brooklyn, intends to meet Friday with Gov. Mario Cuomo and
Saturday with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Stewart
said.
   Later, he said, members of the task force intend to go to
Jamaica ``to make sure that the relief is properly distributed ...
and to make sure it is not used for the political advantage of one
side or the other.''

   A minister who helped arrange meetings
of street gang members aimed at ending violence was accused in a
warrant Wednesday of masterminding a plan to take out $125,000 in
fraudulent student loans.
   The Rev. James Stern of Tabernacle of Faith Baptist Church in
south-central Los Angeles was charged with 15 counts of grand
theft, 13 counts of forgery, and one count of conspiracy to defraud.
   Stern, 24, who helped arrange two much-publicized gang ``summit
meetings'' this summer, didn't respond to a telephone request for
comment.
   Seven others charged in the case are accused of taking out
student loans and turning the money over to Stern, who promised
them $3,000 each, District Attorney's spokesman Andy Reynolds said
Wednesday.
   A criminal complaint filed Tuesday accused Stern of arranging a
scheme to take out government-insured student loans from a Bank of
America branch in Pasadena, Reynolds said.
   Checks from the bank, purportedly for tuition at the University
of Sound Art in Hollywood, were deposited into an account for an
allegedly phony business opened by Stern at another bank, Reynolds

   Checks totaling nearly $36,000 and bearing forged signatures

   George Bush said Wednesday that American flags have sold more
briskly since Republicans ``began restoring pride'' in the country
in 1981. Michael Dukakis stressed support for some weapons and
muted earlier opposition to others as he sought to blunt attacks on
his defense credentials.
   Bush also touted smaller than expected trade deficit figures and
Dukakis accused the Republicans of opposing ``every single effort''
to reform the Pentagon, while their managers fleshed out details on
the campaign debates that are expected to be pivotal in the close
race for the White House.
   Officials said that vice presidential candidates Dan Quayle and
Lloyd Bentsen would hold their only debate of the fall on Oct. 5 in
Omaha, Neb. Los Angeles was fixed as the site of the second and
final Bush-Dukakis debate on either Oct. 13 or 14.
   The two contenders for the White House square off a week from
Sunday in Winston-Salem, N.C., in their first debate of the
campaign.
   Said Bush, ``I've been looking forward to it.''
   But Dukakis went to Annapolis, Md., which was to have hosted a
debate Wednesday night, and taunted the vice president for his
refusal to make it a date. ``If George Bush isn't ready today after
seven and a half years as vice president of this country, how can
we expect him to be ready on Jan. 20, 1989?'' the Democrat said.
   Public opinion polls in recent days have shown Bush holding a
single-digit lead, and Democratic aides said privately they didn't
look for much change in the 10 days before the debates begin.
   However, a Washington Post-ABC News released Wednesday showed
the two candidates essentially tied, with Dukakis leading 48-45.
The survey of 1,092 likely voters had a three-point margin of
error. The survey concluded two days after the recent surveys.
   The vice president said some polls were good and others weren't.
``They cancel out.''
   And he did, wooing Hispanic and Asian voters in a tour of
California, the biggest prize with 47 electoral votes. The vice
president said joblessness among Hispanics has fallen almost twice
as fast under President Reagan as when the Democrats were in the
White House.
   Bush said there was ``new pride in America'' demonstrated by the
performance of a flag-making company in New Jersey.
   Under the Democratic administration of Jimmy Carter, he said,
``They weren't selling that well.''
   ``Well, since we began restoring pride in the United States of
America, business has been booming,'' he said, without naming the
company.
   Later, Bush said he opposed a grape boycott being led by farm
workers union official Cesar Chavez and said that was a big
difference between himself and the ``liberal governor of
Massachusetts.''
   Standing in a field in the San Joaquin Valley, surrounded by
fruit crates, Bush noted figures showing that the trade deficit
fell to a smaller than expected $9.53 billion in July. ``We are
moving in the right direction,'' he said.
   Capping the day in San Francisco, Bush was feted at a colorful
rally in a Chinatown park, but about 400 demonstrators gathered in
Union Square across the luxury St. Francis hotel where he was to
deliver a speech.
   At one point before Bush arrived, protesters began spilling out
into the street, crossing barricades, stopping traffic and the
city's famed cable cars. Police led several away and at least one
person arrested.
   Dukakis supporters passed out anti-Bush fortune cookies in
Chinatown, but Bush's hosts countered with a huge fortune cookie
containing the message, ``November brings good fortune.''
   ``Only one person _ only one person can carry America's peace
and prosperity into the 1990s,'' Bush said, describing himself as
that person.
   Reagan added a few well-aimed barbs at the Democrats during the
day, when he said the opposition was to blame for ``economic and
foreign policy nightmares.''
   ``The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition's
memory lane, it starts to look like `Nightmare on Elm Street,'''
the president said on a campaign trip to Missouri.
   The Massachusetts governor, portrayed by Bush as weak on defense
matters, said in a speech at Georgetown University in Washington
that he would use force ``when it's necessary to protect our
territory, our citizens or our vital interests, to meet our treaty
commitments and to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks.''
   He offered no specifics, nor did he reply to Bush's challenge _
repeated during the day in California _ to say whether he favored
the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983 or the bombing of Libya in
1985.
   Dukakis listed the Stealth bomber, the Trident II sea-based
missile, the advanced cruise missile, the Advanced Tactical
Fighter, a new attack submarine and a new anti-tank weapon as
systems he favors. He criticized the MX missile, which Bush favors,
as a ``smoke and mirrors'' proposal.
   His speech also reflected the softening in his earlier adamant
opposition to the proposed Star Wars space-based defense shield. He
repeated his statement from last week that he wants $1 billion a
year for continued research and would consider deploying the system
under some circumstances.
   Dukakis has opposed the Midgetman missile in the past, but in
his speech said ``the strategic concept...is sound but I question
the value of spending $40 billion or $50 billion for 500 land-based
missile warheads.''
   Dukakis also charged the Reagan administration with neglecting
conventional weapons, and Bentsen sounded a similar theme as he
donned a leather flight jacket and fired up a single-engine trainer
at an airplane museum.
   ``Under this administration, Buck Rogers has been promoted and
our conventional forces have been neglected,'' said Bentsen, who
was a World War II bomber pilot.
   Quayle toured the NORAD missile warning center in Cheyenne
Mountain near Colorado Springs, Colo., and later strongly defended
the Star Wars program as a ``moral, superior way of defending
America.''

   President Reagan is releasing $188 million in
overdue U.S. payments to the United Nations after becoming
convinced that the world body has reformed some administrative and
budgetary procedures.
   At the same time, the White House said Reagan told the State
Department to work out ``a multi-year'' repayment plan involving
some $520 million in arrears that have piled up in recent years
because of U.S. dissatisfaction with the way the U.N. was run.
   ``In announcing these decisions, the president called on the
United Nations to continue progress in areas where reform remains
incomplete,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Tuesday.

   Wisconsin Democrats dashed the comeback hopes of a former
governor by nominating millionaire sports club owner Herbert Kohl
to succeed Sen. William Proxmire, while Republican state Sen. Susan
Engeleiter became the first woman chosen by either party for a
Senate seat this year.
   Elsewhere in six state primaries Tuesday, Vermont Rep. Jim
Jeffords won the right to face Democrat William Gray, a former U.S.
attorney, for the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Robert Stafford.
   New Hampshire Rep. Judd Gregg, son of a former governor,
captured his party's nomination to succeed Republican Gov. John
Sununu and will run against Democrat Paul McEachern.
   In Arizona, Republican candidates loyal to ousted Gov. Evan
Mecham were having mixed results in primary challenges to more than
a dozen legislators who voted to impeach or convict Mecham last
spring. House Speaker Joe Lane was running even with two Mecham
backers, but Senate President Carl Kunasek was running ahead of a
supporter of the former governor.
   Minnesota voters, as expected, set up a November clash between
Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger, seeking a third term, and
Democratic Attorney General Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III.

   The Senate abandoned an effort to expand
federal coverage for Medicaid abortions in the face of strong
opposition from the House and the White House.
   The Senate in July had voted 73-19 to allow federal financing
for Medicaid abortions for women who are victims of rape or incest,
but it backed down on Tuesday in a bow to political reality.
   Under current law, federal spending for Medicaid abortions is
permitted only if the procedure is needed to save a woman's life.
The House reaffirmed its support for that policy last week, and in
the process rejected the Senate's proposal for rape and incest
exceptions.
   President Reagan had promised to veto a $140 billion spending
bill containing all the fiscal 1989 money for the departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education if it came to him
with the Senate's abortion provision.
   The Senate on Tuesday voted 47-43 to kill a motion insisting on
the expanded Medicaid abortion coverage it had approved earlier.

   U.S. experts for the first time
monitored a Soviet nuclear test explosion today at this long-secret
testing ground in the republic of Kazakhstan, the official Tass
news agency reported.
   At 100-150 kilotons, the blast had a forces several times more
powerful than the bomb that devastated Hiroshima, Japan, at the end
of World War II, Tass said.
   The Hagfors Ob servatory of the Swedish Defense Research
Establishment said it measured the explosion at 50-150 kilotons.
   ``The goal of the experiment is to bring into practice the most
effective means of control, in order to use them for verifying the
1974 agreement on limiting underground tests of nuclear weapons and
the 1976 agreement on underground nuclear explosions for peaceful
purposes,'' the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said.

   With Republicans unanimously opposed, the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 10-9 on Wednesday to
approve legislation imposing a trade embargo on white-ruled South
Africa and requiring the withdrawal of U.S. business investment.
   Democrats applauded the action as a blow against South Africa's
apartheid system of forced racial separation, but said they hoped
the measure would enjoy stronger Republican support when it is put
to a vote in the full Senate.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called on Republican
presidential candidate George Bush to reverse course and support
the sanctions bill, a similar version of which has been passed by
the House.

more than two miles away Wednesday when the Soviet Union detonated
a underground nuclear bomb for the first American experts to
witness a Soviet nuclear blast.
   The Americans stood in a chilly wind on the barren test site at
the Forward Command Post Semipalatinsk Polygon about 1,700 miles
southeast of Moscow in the republic of Kazakhstan.
   The wind blew the Soviet and American flags in the direction of
the test range, far from the nearest settlement on the steppes of

   George Bush has seized the advantage in the
early stages of the fall presidential race, delineating the key
campaign issues and boxing his opponent into a defensive corner.
But he'd best not rest, pollsters say.
   The very factors that allowed Bush to turn the tables on Michael
Dukakis make his current lead a precarious one, poll analysts said
Wednesday. Though Bush is ahead, they said, voters' choices remain
unusually tentative.
   ``It's all very volatile. It's still to be won or lost,'' said
Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris & Associates. ``Even if
Bush was to go 10 or 12 points ahead, it would not mean he is
certain to win by any means.''

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit showed the
biggest improvement in almost six years in July, a dramatic 28
percent narrowing that reflected a big decline in Americans'
appetite for foreign goods, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said the difference between what the
United States imports and what it sells abroad shrank to $9.53
billion in July, down $3.6 billion from a June deficit of $13.22
billion.
   The Reagan administration lost no time hailing the huge decline
as proof that the administration's economic strategy of fighting
soaring trade deficits with a devaluation of the dollar was paying
off.

   New devices that automatically deliver
heart-starting electrical jolts and can be operated with little
training could save many of the 400,000 Americans who die each year
of cardiac arrest, according to a new report.
   The machines are sophisticated versions of the defibrillators
that doctors and paramedics have used for decades, but so automated
that they are much easier to use.
   When attached to the chest, the device will check the victim's
heart and deliver a shock if it finds he has suffered cardiac
arrest, a disastrous interruption in the heart's blood-pumping
rhythm. If given soon enough, the shock almost always restarts the
stalled heart.

rejecting seven Republican legislators who helped impeach and

   ``We stand at the dawn of a great awakening in Arizona,'' Mecham
supporter Jerry Gillespie said Tuesday night after defeating Senate
President Carl Kunasek in the GOP primary by 6,548 votes to 5,610
votes. ``The people of this state have begun the process of
regaining control of their state government.''
   But the results of the voting hardly constituted a sweep by the

   Fawn Hall and Donna Rice didn't. Paula Parkinson,
Jessica Hahn, Rita Jenrette and Debra Murphree did.
   Getting scandal-entangled women to bare all is a major coup for
men's magazines, which pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to
titillate.
   Besides dangling six-figure fees, such magazines as Playboy and
Penthouse wine and dine these formerly obscure women and offer the
promise of nationwide publicity. The reason is simple: scandal
sells.
   ``Women, or even men who are at the center of a storm, of any
kind, are always best-sellers,'' said Penthouse publisher Bob
Guccione.
   When Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle was chosen as the Republican vice
presidential candidate, Penthouse and Playboy rushed to resurrect
features on Paula Parkinson, the comely blond lobbyist who
accompanied Quayle and two other politicians on a golf outing eight
years ago.
   Playboy's November issue includes new coments from Parkinson,
claiming Quayle propositioned her on the Florida weekend, and a
nude photograph of Parkinson taken in 1980.
   Penthouse's story, also for November, includes fresh remarks
from a 1981 interview about an alleged dalliance with Rep. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., as well as statements about Quayle.
   ``The idea behind this is to get somebody who's in the public
eye ... and show something about that person that you can't find
any place else,'' said Nat Lehrman, a former Playboy publishing
executive and now chairman of Columbia College's journalism school
here.
   Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual encounter
with Jim Bakker led to the PTL evangelist's downfall last year, got
her second Playboy feature in the September issue.
   Her first spread appeared in Playboy's November 1987 issue,
featuring several nude photographs and Hahn's version of what
happened with Bakker. The issue sold more than 5 million copies at
newsstands, about 1.5 million more than usual.
   Hahn contends Penthouse offered her $12 million to appear. She
chose instead to tell her story to Playboy for a rumored $1 million.
   ``Playboy approached me and Penthouse (too) pretty much when the
story broke,'' Hahn, 29, said in a telephone interview from
Phoenix, where she's working in radio.
   Penthouse, she said, ``was making a lot of promises that they
could not keep. The money was endless. I mean it was ridiculous.''
   Playboy contends Hahn and an agent first approached the
magazine, which Hahn denies. Regardless of who made the first move,
Playboy acknowledges she was a big catch.
   ``If there is another magazine out there that we feel
competitive with ... we try to get our offer on the table first,
and I think there was probably some of that that went on with
Jessica Hahn,'' said Jeff Cohen, managing photo editor for Playboy.
   Penthouse struck it rich with its July issue, featuring the
woman at the center of the scandal involving televangelist Jimmy
Swaggart. The magazine includes explicit photos of Debra Murphree
showing the things she contends Swaggart asked her to do in a motel
room.
   The Murphree issue sold out in five days, selling more than 4
million copies, double the normal newsstand sales, according to
Penthouse officials.
   Guccione and an attorney for Murphree declined to reveal how
much she was paid, but it was rumored to be $75,000 to $100,000.
   Murphree, jailed in Louisiana on an unrelated prostitution
charge, was not available for comment. Her attorney Tom Weymann,
explained her motivation.
   ``Primarily, she was trying to get out of the life that she had
found herself in. There was the motivation of not only the money,
but also to set the record straight of exactly what happened,'' he
said.
   Scandals, especially those involving sex, are guaranteed hits
for magazines because the public wants ``to see the naked woman who
played Delilah to whatever Samson of the moment,'' said Barry
Blackman, a New York photographer. Blackman's photographs of
Elizabeth Ray, the non-typing secretary and ex-mistress of former
Ohio Rep. Wayne Hayes, wound up in Hustler magazine.
   Nude photos of Ray also appeared in Penthouse and Playboy.
   But capitalizing on scandals can be tricky, said Nancie S.
Martin, editor in chief of Playgirl magazine. ``You have to get to
people at the right time. You have to pay them a lot of money. You
have to hope it's still a scandal when the magazine comes out.
   ``There's always the concern that it might be exploitive, that
you might be taking somebody involved in a sex scandal and giving
them more limelight than they deserve,'' she said.
   Often, posing nude is a way for women linked to scandal to
create or advance careers, said Martin. But why would someone like
Rita Jenrette, ex-wife of former South Carolina Congressman John
Jenrette, want to bare her body to millions?
   ``I thought it would be a hoot, a funny thing to do,'' said
Jenrette, 38, who appreared in Playboy in April 1981 after her
husband's bribery and conspiracy conviction in the FBI Abscam
investigation.
   ``People caught in the midst of turmoil, you do a lot of
uncharacteristic things,'' said Jenrette, now living in New York
and pursuing an acting career. ``I never anticipated the
criticism.''
   She said a Washington reporter and his wife persuaded her to
pose, and Playboy says it willingly agreed.
   ``There is a curiosity about these people that the other news
media pick up. Rita Jenrette was everywhere,'' Cohen said. ``(But)
we had her story, and we had glamorous nude photographs of her.''
   The issue featuring Jenrette sold a little more than 6.2 million
copies, more than a million over normal sales of the time.
   ``It was one of our biggest sellers,'' Cohen said.
   Jenrette says she doesn't think Playboy exploited her troubles
to make a buck.
   As far as men's magazines making money off the scandal, she
said, ``What else is there? It sells. ... The sensational grabs
people.''
   That's why Playboy and Penthouse, offering six-figure payoffs,
hotly pursued Donna Rice, whose relationship with former Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart doomed his presidential hopes, and Fawn Hall, the
blond National Security Council secretary who helped Oliver North
shred and alter documents about arms deals in the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   ``Donna Rice I think we were close to making a deal with at one
point,'' said Playboy's Cohen. ``Nudity was discussed. She just
walked away from it. There were several conversations with her,
lunches ... but no deal was made. Why she turned us down, I don't
know. ...
   ``Fawn Hall ... would have certainly been a cover (story), would
have sold well,'' Cohen said.
   Playboy would not disclose their offers, but Guccione said
Penthouse offered Rice about $350,000 and Hall $250,000 ``because
anybody in the country would want to read'' about them.
   Hall's attorney, Plato Cacheris, said he understood the interest
in his client.
   But ``the money did not tempt her,'' he said. ``She's too much
of a lady ... and she's not going to try to capitalize in any
unseemly way.''
   Rice could not be reached and her Miami attorney, Thomas
McAliley was vacationing and unavailable to explain why she
rejected the offers.
   Should she or Hall have second thoughts, it may be too late.
   ``The timing is all-important,'' said Cohen. ``Right now, I
don't think either of them have much value.''

   The term paparazzi comes from a private joke by
film director Federico Fellini.
   Paparazzo was the name of an aggressive celebrity photographer
in Fellini's 1959 film ``La Dolce Vita.'' But according to the
Random House Dictionary of the English Language, the famed Italian
moviemaker found the Italian name in the 1901 English novel ``By
the Ionian Sea,'' by George Giffing, which Fellini read while
making ``La Dolce Vita.''
   In the book, Mr. Paparazzo is an innkeeper. There is no Italian
word ``paparazzo,'' and the common plural for the photographers,
paparazzi, was invented.

<HEAD>Public Television Brings `Thin Blue Line' Wide Audience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Thin Blue Line,'' the documentary movie
about a Texas murder that has audiences buzzing, owes its origin to
an unusual source _ public television.
   The film, playing in selected theaters across the country, is
among the latest fruits of an innovative financing deal created by
the Public Broadcasting Service's ``American Playhouse'' series.
   The arrangement, by which PBS helps pay production costs in
exchange for first television rights, has yielded some of the most
critically acclaimed independent films in recent years, including
1983's ``Testament,'' 1984's ``El Norte,'' 1985's ``Smooth Talk,''
last year's ``Stand and Deliver'' and now, ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   ``I don't think any of those movies would have happened without
`American Playhouse,''' said Lindsay Law, the series' executive
producer.
   In an age of soaring production costs and diminishing
underwriting, the ``American Playhouse'' formula stands as a
cost-efficient programming breakthrough.
   For the investment of about $500,000, PBS not only obtains
movies costing as much as $4 million, but it also enjoys all of the
publicity the movies generate in their theatrical runs. ``The Thin
Blue Line'' is a case in point.
   The cinematically inventive documentary, directed by Errol
Morris, centers on a prisoner's 12-year effort to clear himself in
the murder of a Dallas police officer. As Morris tells the story,
there are a number of questions about the guilt of Randall Adams,
serving a life sentence for the 1976 murder of officer Robert Wood.
   The possible culprit, as the film implies, is drifter David
Harris, a career criminal who was the star prosecution witness
against Adams. The movie has gathered glowing reviews, fairly brisk
box-office business and a petition drive aimed at clearing Adams'
name.
   The documentary will not appear on PBS for at least a year _
that, too, is part of the deal. But if it continues to receive the
acclaim it now attracts, ``The Thin Blue Line'' will arrive on
public television with a built-in audience and be a hit.
   ``The biggest problem that we have isn't that we don't have good
programs,'' said Suzanne Weil, PBS' senior vice president for
programming. ``We have terrific programs. It's that nobody ever
knows about them. ... Every once in a while, though, we do one of
the these (movies), and the word gets out. So it's a great way of
getting some attention.''
   At the start, public television stations were somewhat less
impressed with the concept.
   ``When we first released `Testament' and `El Norte,' the
stations were actually quite upset because both films were very
well-received,'' said Law. ``And the stations knew they had
invested money in the movies and yet it was playing down the street
from their station, and they couldn't put it on the air.
   ``And we kept saying, `Listen. This will pay off. These two
titles will be known to people when we put them on television.' ..
. And `Testament' and `El Norte' had twice `American Playhouse's'
normal audience.''
   The financing idea was born, in part, out of the inability of
``American Playhouse'' to attract the kind of talent its producers
hoped it would lure. ``A lot of very interesting writers and
directors who we thought might come running did not,'' Law said.
   ``What they dreamt of spending their time and talent on was
feature films, not television. They very much grew up in that
generation where the Golden Age of television was not part of their
background. The television that was part of their background was
something not really worth the time or effort,'' Law said.
   One upcoming project on the ``American Playhouse'' movie
schedule is ``Bloodhounds of Broadway,'' starring Madonna and Matt
Dillon and costing around $4 million.
   ``If I were making `Bloodhounds of Broadway' just for
television, there's no way I could have ever got it made,'' Law
said. ``But since it was going to be a feature film first, I could
go to feature film sources for financing who would not normally
finance something for television.''
   And, in the end, the viewers of ``American Playhouse'' enjoy the
savings.

<DATELINE>PACK CREEK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Across 20 feet of ankle-deep water,
Charlie Land stares at a brown bear sow.
   The bear stares back. She scratches her side, then lunges at
Land. He fills the shrinking gap with a pink cloud of hot-pepper
aerosol, a sort of natural tear gas, and the bear wheels back to
her side of the stream.
   Again she scratches. Finally she ambles off across the tidal
flat.
   Land backsteps up the gravel spit he was defending, then turns
to the three people waiting a dozen steps behind him.
   ``She didn't mean it,'' he says. ``She wasn't serious.''
   Land shrugs off such confrontations as part of his job with the
Alaska Department of Fish and Game, enforcing an uneasy truce
between man and bear at one of the few places where the species
willingly meet.
   Pack Creek flows into a narrow ocean inlet from a steep valley
on Admiralty Island, about 30 miles south of Juneau. The island
boasts the greatest density in the world of Alaska brown bears, a
larger version of the grizzly species.
   Late each summer, about 30 bears congregate at Pack Creek,
splashing through the shallows after spawning salmon and grazing in
the surrounding meadow like a herd of cows.
   The interlopers, game officials say, are the increasing numbers
of wildlife watchers whose eagerness to capture bears on film is
crowding this corner of wilderness.
   Pack Creek is one of only three observatories in Alaska where
people can readily watch brown bears. The two others are so popular
the state has a visitor limit at one and a lottery for permits to
the other.
   Now Pack Creek is being overwhelmed.
   Up to 60 people a day hunker on the gravel spit. Yachts
congregate offshore; bush planes buzz in and out steadily. In 1981,
100 people came to Pack Creek. Last year the visits topped 990.
   Until this year visitors and bears chased each other around the
meadow at Pack Creek, the people in pursuit of photographic
trophies, the bears guarding prime spots on the salmon stream.
   But gradually, the bears have grown bolder, and less intimidated
by humans. They have chased people off the spit and carried away
packs and food. Biologists learned from maulings at Yellowstone and
other parks which once had garbage dumps that bears become most
dangerous when they associate people with food.
   ``We think we have a bomb there and it's ticking,'' says Ken
Mitchell, U.S. Forest Service director for the Admiralty Island
Nationl Monument.
   Mitchell backs a plan, designed by the Forest Service and state
game officials, to designate the spit as human turf and leave the
rest of Pack Creek to the bears. The authorities hope the boundary
will keep people from being mauled and bears from being killed.
   A few bear-watchers are furious.
   ``The bears are all used to people and they're busy fishing.
They don't mind you,'' says John Tillinghast, a Juneau attorney who
visited the creek one recent weekend.
   Tillinghast said it used to be easy to come away from Pack Creek
with a standard prize: ``Mom and cubs with a 50-millimeter lens ..
. and you didn't have any babysitter from Fish and Game watching
you either.''
   The bear that lunged at Land _ called ``Pest'' with reason _
prompted the new rule. In 1987, a Forest Service letter file grew
fat with reports of bold advances by bears along the creek, mostly
Pest:
   _ Three wildlife watchers reported Pest circled them chomping
and growling, then jumped toward them. She was turned away by
hot-pepper spray.
   _ A San Francisco man told the Forest Service he was chased into
the loft of a woodshed. ``The only reason that I did not shoot was
that there was a similar problem yesterday'' and the bear did not
attack, he wrote.
   _ Tourists abandoned a pizza on the spit while fleeing from an
approaching bear. A researcher recorded the bear's reward, down to
the cheese hanging from its snout and paws.
   Forest Service staffers at Pack Creek pleaded with Mitchell to
do something. ``None of us wants to see Pest killed, but we feel
some action must be taken soon to prevent more incidents,'' they
wrote, suggesting the creek be closed to people.
   In July 1987, the Forest Service and Alaska Fish and Game
announced Pest would be killed. When the anticipated roar of
protest came, they began work on the less drastic plan adopted this
year.
   Enter Stan Price, an irascible 88-year-old who loathes
government officials on principal and who has become a rallying
point for others opposed to this particular government plan.
   Price built his cabin and floated it onto the remote banks of
Pack Creek more than 30 years ago. In the decades since, he has
shared the creek with dozens of bears and raised orphan cubs.
   ``It burns me up,'' Price says of the new rules, which he feels
allow game officials to harass the animals. ``I can't say what a
bear's worth. I can't say what a bear's good for. But I know they
were here before we were.''
   He reports little conflict with the bears that wander into his
cabins and woodsheds. Price calls them tame and says he was injured
by a bear only once, when he mistook a strange animal for a
familiar one and was swatted on the shoulder as he approached.
   Price believes the Forest Service and Fish and Game have trumped
up tales of danger so people will believe they need official
protection at Pack Creek. Then in the name of safety the agencies
can charge admission and turn the creek into a money-making
Yellowstone, he says.
   Price knows the bears by name and lineage and becomes distraught
at thoughts they might be shot or relocated.
   State and federal officials have said that if the boundary
system doesn't work they will relocate Pest and, if she returns to
Pack Creek and causes trouble, she'll be killed.
   The Forest Service hopes to exercise some crowd control, too, by
limiting commercial tours, which now account for more than half the
visitors. Officials are considering a fee to cover the government
cost of monitoring Pack Creek, estimated at more than $20,000 a
year. They say there's no intent, as Price suggested, of making a
profit.
   Someday, Mitchell predicts, there'll be need for an observatory
where hundreds of people can go to watch the bears' annual fishing
binge.
   But it won't be at Pack Creek.
   ``If there are such viewing areas,'' Mitchell says, ``they
probably shouldn't be in wilderness.''

<HEAD>Southern Baptist Moderates Huddle on Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restraint tempered desperate words at a strategy
session of Southern Baptist moderates about ``where we go'' in a
denomination now run by fundamentalists.
   ``We are Baptists in a denomination that has stopped being
Baptist,'' said Kirby Godsey, president of Mercer University in
Macon, Ga.
   The 900 moderate leaders of the coalition, the Southern Baptist
Alliance, made no move at their meeting in Nashville, Tenn., last
weekend to quit the 14.7-million-member denomination, although some
speculated it eventually could happen.
   For the time being, however, participants took lesser measures,
launching such independent projects as alternative Sunday school
lessons and theological education. They keenly lamented the control
achieved by fundamentalists over the denomination, the country's
largest Protestant body.
   It ``is wounded and just may be mortally wounded,'' said the
Rev. Randall Lolley of Raleigh, N.C.
   The Rev. Tom Grace of St. John's Baptist Church, Charlotte,
N.C., said, ``We now exist in a state of grief, grief over loss of
our mother denomination.''
   Its historic principles ``are in eclipse,'' Godsey said. ``In
the midst of these dreadful and frightening shadows of
denominational eclipse we huddle together to find reassurance and
light enough to sustain us.''
   The three-day meeting was called after fundamentalists last June
won denominational rule for the 10th straight year.
   They insist on a literal view of the Bible as ``inerrant'' _
free of error historically, scientifically and religiously.
Moderates allow for diverse interpretations.
   The fundamentalist wing gradually has gained sway over church
institutions through the appointive powers of a succession of
fundamentalist presidents, the latest being the Rev. Jerry Vines of
Jacksonville, Fla.
   Sizing up the present status of moderates, the Rev. Cecil
Sherman of Fort Worth, Texas, told the Nashville meeting, ``We have
been put out of the house. The game goes on, but we don't get to
play.''
   The alliance has 36,460 members, including individuals and
member churches, in 38 states.
   Its board voted to publish independent adult Sunday school
lessons beginning in January, for those dissatisfied with materials
put out by the denominational Sunday School Board.
   The alliance also decided to support a House of Baptist studies
at Duke University, a Methodist institution in Durham, N.C., and a
Divinity School at Lake Forest University in Winston Salem, N.C.
   The moderates alloted $30,000 to support various causes
purportedly spurned by the fundamentalist administration, such as
peace making, housing for the poor, women in ministry and the
doctrine of priesthood of the believer.
   Moderates criticized several recent denominational actions under
fundamentalist control, including:
   _ The Home Mission Board's prohibition of support to female
pastors or divorced persons as missionaries.
   _ The foreign mission board's dismissal of a missionary, the
Rev. Michael Willett, accusing him of ``doctrinal ambiguity'' for
not holding a literalistic view of some miracles.
   _ A funding cut for the Baptist Joint Committee on Public
Affairs, a religious liberty watchdog agency in Washington
involving eight Baptist denominations.
   _ Tightened control over the Southeastern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., resulting in resignations of the
president, most top administrators and some faculty.
   The alliance's interim executive director, the Rev. Alan Neely,
a professor at Princeton University, said the organization is not
planning a new denomination but also is not ruling out that
possibility.
   ``The future is uncertain,'' he said. ``The alliance will remain
active in its support for Baptist principles and the Baptist
heritage of freedom until what we perceive as designed,
concentrated, calculated oppression is relieved.
   ``We are simply trying to provide an arena for people who have
been selected out, prevented, prohibited, blackballed by those in
power to have a place to stand and can have some free air to
breathe.''
   A straw poll at the meeting found 90 percent of the participants
favored some change in relation to the denomination's ``cooperative
program'' through which various agencies are financed.
   Several particpants favored continued support for that unified
budget, but also creation of foundations to finance causes not
backed by the denomination but deemed important to moderates.
   Others favored ``designated giving'' only to chosen
denominational programs, with moderates putting other funds in
escrow until fundamentalists agree to political changes in bylaws
that enable factional control.
   The proposals were to be considered at an alliance board meeting
scheduled for Nov. 28-29 in Charlotte, N.C.

   A Lutheran pastor has asked his congregation
for permission to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies, but his
bishop says congregations do not have the authority to sanction
such unions.
   The Rev. James Bartos, pastor of the Village Church, says a
decision will be made after a church forum on the issue Sept. 18,
when the congregation will discuss biblical and ethical concerns
relating to homosexual relationships.
   Bishop Peter Rogness of the Southeastern Wisconsin Synod of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America said he applauded Bartos'
effort to examine a contemporary question, but ``a congregation
would not be sanctioned to perform homosexual marriages.''
   Bartos says that while bishops are influential, church
conventions and not bishops set policy, and conventions have not
specified whether congregations can authorize homosexual marriages,
leaving open the door for congregations to decide about it.

   DECATUR, Ga. _ About two-thirds of the ``most militant
moderates'' within the Southern Baptist Convention want to reduce
or eliminate their support of their church, the nation's largest
Protestant denomination, according to a survey by a weekly
newspaper aligned with a moderate faction.
   But about one-third of the more than 800 respondents to the SBC
Today survey want to leave intact their relationship with and
support of Southern Baptists.
   Editor Jack Harwell said he was surprised the number favoring
the status quo was so high because ``these readers of SBC Today are

<TEXT>
   A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter
the skyline of Atlanta, previously dismissed as sterile and
nondescript.
   Even homegrown architect John Portman, whose glass towers and
soaring atriums for years defined Atlanta and who in the past
criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a
nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office building
planned for downtown Atlanta.
   Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the
capital of the New South started last fall with the opening of the
50-story IBM building. Officially called One Atlantic Center, it is
a slender, post-modern tower of stone with tall arched entryways
and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high,
eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern.
   Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as
drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command
attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words
like ``gracious,'' ``truly wonderful,'' ``serene,'' ``imposing''
and ``glamorous'' to describe the tower.
   ``It certainly projects a vibrance to the rest of the world,''
said Roy Cooper, vice president for economic development with the
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. ``It's just beautiful. Everybody's
just staggered by it.''
   The tower is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in
modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of
the city's tallest buildings.
   Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going
up in Atlanta, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper
complex was altered to complement the rose-colored IBM tower.
   New York architect John Burgee, whose firm designed the IBM
building with design consultant Philip Johnson, won't take credit
for transforming Atlanta's skyline. But he said the city's image,
as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change.
   ``Atlanta has been looking for its identity,'' Burgee said in a
telephone interview from his New York office. ``It's an historical
city (but) its architecture and image is not strictly historical.
You think of Atlanta and you think of `Gone With The Wind.' Now,
there is an attempt to come up with a visual image.
   ``We all know Peachtree Street, but you don't think of its
buildings,'' he said. ``Like in New York, the Empire State
Building; Chicago, the Sears building; San Francisco, the
TransAmerica building. Atlanta doesn't have that. It's moving
toward that, very definitely.''
   Burgee and Johnson also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree
Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown Atlanta.
   Another planned project grouped in the ``Son of IBM'' building
spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section,
a complex of three office buildings and a hotel being developed by
AT&T and the Atlanta-based Landmarks Group.
   When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of
glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the
excitement over the nearby IBM Tower, its architects, Thompson,
Ventulett & Stainback, redrew the plans to use rose glass above
rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire.
   The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by
Portman, whose imprint is already deeply felt in Atlanta, primarily
through the Peachtree Center and the towering cylindrical Westin
Peachtree Plaza Hotel.
   Portman's new building is slated to begin construction next year
and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One Atlantic as the Southeast's
tallest building. Unveiling the design in May, Portman said it was
``respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold
and forward-looking _ the beginning of post-post-modern
architecture.''
   Dale Durfee, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech, said
completion of the IBM tower signaled the acceleration of a change
in the look of the city that began a decade ago.
   ``Atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla,'' he said, ``with no
development of architectural significance.''
   Burgee echoed that appraisal, saying, ``It was pretty
nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you (to Atlanta)

where you are.''
   Durfee said that 10 years ago, Atlanta was groping to form an
identity and had no demand for the type of buildings now are going
up.
   Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office
buildings, Durfee said, and corporate sponsorship of building
projects has changed the rules of skyscraper financing.
   Some say that all the building activity simply makes good
business sense.
   ``Sure, there's competitive prestige. Good architecture is good
business,'' said Truman Hartshorn, chairman of the geography
department at Georgia State University and a specialist in urban
affairs.
   A good-looking building, he said, ``is easier to sell to the
financing people as well as the tenants.''
   Hartshorn said he expects the new projects in Atlanta will bring
special recognition.
   ``I think it's going to open some eyes,'' he said. ``We have
prestige with our cultural buildings, but I don't know that our
office buildings are that distinctive nationally.
   ``These aren't just ultra post-modern. They're classic. They're
different.''

<HEAD>Greek Island of Patmos Holds Out Against Nudity and Nightclubs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PATMOS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nightclubs and nudity are banned on this
island where tradition holds that St. John wrote the New
Testament's Book of Revelation in a cave overlooking the Aegean Sea.
   Under a special government decree, Patmos has a unique status
among Greece's 200 or so inhabited islands as a ``holy island''
still dominated by its 900-year-old Byzantine monastery.
   ``We prefer our visitors to be pilgrims rather than ordinary
tourists and we would like them to respect our tradition,'' Abbot
Isidoros, who heads the 30-member community at the Monastery of St.
John the Theologian, said in an interview.
   But plans for an airport coupled with widespread publicity for
the monastery's 900th anniversary celebrations are expected to
bring mass tourism to Patmos in the coming years.
   The tranquillity of Patmos, a rocky outcrop in the Dodecanese
group of islands with around 2,000 residents, attracts wealthy
Greeks and foreigners who have restored scores of traditional
mansions clustered beneath the monastery's gray fortress-like walls.
   Many have given donations to the monastery, to help maintain its
library of rare manuscripts and early books, along with a
collection of priceless icons _ portraits of saints painted in gold
and bright colors.
   ``Patmos is still a place apart, with a unique atmosphere.
Unlike other islands, a conscious effort has been made to protect
it,'' said Maria King Constantinides, a Boston antiques dealer with
a family home there.
   Signs in Greek, French, German or English scattered around the
island's beaches point out that nudity is not allowed. One disco
operates on a remote bay, but the narrow alleys around the
monastery fall silent by 10 p.m., even in summer.
   ``People sometimes go topless on the beaches, but ... on the
whole the rules are respected,'' said Christos Kyrozis, the
island's doctor and also its mayor.
   The development project planned by Greece's state tourist
organization EOT, together with the monastery and town authorities,
calls for construction of an airport, zoning for new hotels and
bungalows and improved harbor facilities.
   ``Past experience shows that once an island gets an airport,
mass tourism is very difficult to avoid,'' said Eleni Bonou, who
heads the project. ``But an airport is essential because it serves
the islanders first.''
   More than 30,000 visitors come to Patmos every year, but
two-thirds of them arrive aboard cruise ships that steam away
before sunset after a few hours' stay.
   On an island too barren to grow its own food, visitors are the
only source of income apart from fishing.
   ``There's a delicate balance to be kept between God and mammon
on this island,'' Mayor Kyrozis said. ``There has to be tourism,
but not so much it kills what we have to offer.''
   Trained for a more secluded life, the monks say it's already
hard work taking turns to supervise the tourists swarming through
the monastery museum, its frescoed chapels and stone colonnades.
   ``The sheer numbers of people coming through mean that we're
exhausted by the time the season's over and there's time to get on
with our own tasks,'' said Brother Chrysostomos, the monastery
librarian.
   The tourists also crowd into the Monastery of the Apocalypse,
built over the cave where St. John supposedly wrote his visionary
work while exiled on Patmos around A.D. 95.
   ``It's historical fact that St. John was on the island,'' said
Athanassios Kominis, an Athens University professor of Byzantine
studies. ``The tradition that he wrote Revelation there is
certainly more than speculation, but not quite certainty,''
   Patriarch Dimitrios, spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox
Christians worldwide, plans to lead Orthodox, Roman Catholic and
Protestant churchmen in a two-day international pilgrimage to
Patmos Sept. 25-26.
   It celebrates the 900th birthday of the Monastery of St. John,
founded in 1088 by a Byzantine scholar, the Blessed Christodoulos
with special permission from the Emperor Alexius Comnenos.

<HEAD>Texas Experts Downplay Impact of Recent Oil Price Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few years back the prospect of $14 a barrel oil
sent shivers down many a Texas spine, but state economists and oil
analysts are shrugging off the possible effects of the recent slide
in oil prices to near two-year lows.
   Optimists might attribute the change in attitude to a
diversification of the state's economy since the great oil bust of
1986.
   But analysts say the main reason for the change is that oil
companies have grown so lean since then that prices would have to
drop considerably further to wreak more short-term havoc with the
industry and the state's economy.
   Oil futures slipped below $14 per barrel this week before
surging back a bit after King Fahd of Saudi Arabia called for
better cooperation among OPEC members.
   The October contract for delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 7 cents to settle at $14.56
a barrel on Tuesday.
   The October contract had skidded as low as $13.75 during
Monday's trading, marking the lowest level since Oct. 29, 1986,
before rebounding. On spot markets, crude prices also are below
$14.50.
   Despite the dwindling ``upstream'' profits from drilling and
production, Texas refineries are profitably working around the
clock. And the integrated oil companies have streamlined enough to
make up for the low price of crude with the relatively firm price
of refined products.
   ``The energy industry is just as important as it once was, but
if you look at the region and the composition of industry, it's a
much smaller share,'' said Michelle Michot Foss, senior associate
at Houston's Rice Center. ``Not that the others have grown so much,
but because the oil industry has gotten smaller.''
   The Texas economy has grown less dependent on oil tax revenue:
the state had a $113 million budget surplus in the 1988 fiscal year
despite continuing problems in the oilpatch.
   In fiscal 1987, the state Legislature had to raise taxes to
cover a $5.7 billion deficit and meet a constitutional requirement
for a balanced budget.
   Texas Employment Commission figures indicate the estimated
statewide civilian workforce in oil and gas extraction declined by
57,700 jobs between December 1985 and December 1986, to 184,500
from 242,200.
   The Houston area lost about 160,000 jobs of all types during the
first major drop in oil prices in 1982-83, and an additional
130,000 jobs disappeared in the 1986 price plunge, officials said.
   ``Our short-term dependency on oil during this recovery, oddly
enough, is not that great. But the state's long-term dependency is
significant,'' said Ray Perryman, director of the Baylor University
Forecasting Service.
   Texas' gradual economic recovery, he said, has been driven
primarily by export industries, including petrochemicals, paper,
aircraft and electronics.
   ``I think that a year from today, if the price of oil stays at
that level, the economic outlook in Texas will be lower than
otherwise,'' Perryman said. ``But I don't think we're going to have
any significant problems unless the price drops below the Texas
production levels of $11.50 a barrel and stays there.''
   Tony Proffitt, a spokesman for State Comptroller Bob Bullock,
also said a sustained depression in oil prices would hurt the state
economy, but the industry's importance had declined in recent
years. He noted that oil and gas revenue accounted for only 9
percent of state economic activity, compared with as much as 27
percent at one time.
   The comptroller's office reported $490.5 million in oil tax
revenue during the 1988 fiscal year and projected $531.7 million in
1989 revenue. The estimated figure may have to be lowered if prices
continue dropping, Proffitt said.
   Many analysts predict continuing softness in the market,
although there is widespread belief that current low levels are
temporary.
   However, there is fear that even short-term dips could have a
chilling effect on the industry and score a psychological blow to
the optimism needed in a recovering economy.
   ``I've already seen some indications of companies making
decisions that are a little more conservative than they would have
been otherwise,'' said Ken Miller, senior consultant at the
consulting firm Purvin & Gertz, Inc.
   ``This price drop is certainly nowhere near the same magnitude
as what happened in 1986, but I think it's reminding people of
that,'' said Miller, who is predicting moderate price increases in
late 1988. ``Some people were starting to get a little complacent
with the price up a little bit, and this is a reminder that that
low price atmosphere is certainly still with us.''

   Boxing champ Mike Tyson's image has taken some
lumps outside the ring in the past few weeks, and some advertising
consultants say it may cost him lucrative commercial work.
   ``Nobody wants to lose the customers they already have, and all
the negative stuff with him is a way to lose customers,'' said
Lloyd Kolmer, who heads a firm that advises advertisers on signing
celebrities for commercials.
   Since dispatching Michael Spinks in a 91-second bout for the
heavyweight chasmpionship in June, Tyson has gone through a
rancorous court battle with his manager, engaged in a street fight
with a former opponent and survived a car crash that one newspaper
reported _ and Tyson denied _ was an attempted suicide.
   Those incidents offer a contrast to the cheery and confident guy
who appeared in three Diet Pepsi commercials this past summer, in
which the soda maker touted Tyson and Diet Pepsi as ``undisputed
champs.'' In one of the ads, the champ took a soft drink from the
refrigerator while his wife, actress Robin Givens, playfully
snapped a towel at him.
   The ads were so popular that Pepsi-Cola Co. ran them for two
months instead of the one month originally planned, Pepsi spokesman
Tod MacKenzie said Tuesday.
   MacKenzie said the Tyson ads were last run in late August. The
company now is using ads featuring America's Cup yachtsman Dennis
Conner.
   He said recent publicity about Tyson had no bearing on the
decision to quit using the Tyson Diet Pepsi ads. ``They had run
their course,'' Mackenzie said.
   He said there never had been any talk of a longer-term relation
with Tyson, who reportedly was paid $1.25 million for his work.
   But Kolmer, who was not involved in negotiating Tyson's
appearance in the ads, speculated that Pepsi had an option to
continue to use Tyson in its ads but chose not to do so.
   ``In effect, he has been fired. They can phrase it any way they
want to,'' he said.
   Bill Cayton, Tyson's manager, said the reports about Tyson had
hurt the boxer's image, but insisted that Tyson had been a ``victim
of circumstance'' who would be able over time to improve his image.
   Cayton said that meanwhile, he had ``put on hold'' his talks
with a battery maker and an electronics company about having Tyson
appear in commercials for them. He refused to identify the
companies.
   ``I'm not pushing at this time,'' Cayton said. ``It's not the
best negotiating atmosphere. I want this unfair wave to subside
before I proceed.''
   Cayton said Tyson is ``the best fighter in the world today'' and
said he was confident Tyson ``will go on to bigger and better
things in every area.''
   Tyson signed one-year contracts within the past few months to
appear in ads in Japan for Suntory beer and Toyota vehicles, Cayton
said.
   In addition, Nintendo of America Inc., a Redmont, Wash.-based
video games maker, signed Tyson 13 months ago to a two-year
contract to appear in ads for ``Mike Tyson's Punch-Out,'' which has
proven one of its best-selling products.
   Richard Lindner, a Nintendo spokesman, said there had been no
discussion of cancelling the agreement. He said the Tyson game was
not currently being advertised, however, because the company
normally pitches only its new releases with advertising.
   Nova Lanktree, director of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in
Chicago, said she views Tyson as ``a celebrity who has transcended
his sport'' and expects he will weather the recent controversy.
   ``His career is by no means over as an endorsement candidate,''
she said.
   But Marty Blackman, who advises advertisers on use of sports
celebrities, said ``the advertising industry by nature is a
conservative industry.''
   ``Certain behavior may be more acceptable in New York than it is
in the heartland,'' he said. ``We are advising clients to proceed
with caution.''

<HEAD>Rutgers Researcher Develops New Way Of Determining Shelf Life Of
Food</HEAD>

   A professor at Rutgers University has
developed what the school says is a faster way of measuring food
deterioration, which could reduce the need for preservatives and
help cut food manufacturing costs.
   The method combines previously known scientific tools with
computer technology and lets researchers measure food shelf life
within hours, compared with the weeks or years it used to take,
school officials said Tuesday.
   Rutgers has applied for a patent for the process, which can be
applied to dried goods such as cookies, fruit, breakfast cereal,
instant coffee and milk powder, said Myron Solberg, director of
Rutgers' Center for Advanced Food Technology.
   The roots of the process date to more than 10 years ago, when
Seymour Gilbert, an internationally known food-packaging expert and
long-time Rutgers professor, found a way of measuring how food
absorbs potential carcinogens from packaging. His findings were
applied worldwide.
   He began using the same technology five years ago to find out
how food breaks down, and since then has been working on the
problem with a team of almost 20 graduate students.
   The key to determining shelf life is discovering how the water
interacts with food, he said.
   Gilbert, 74, illustrates his case with the bagel, which turns
hard after a few days but regains its softness when toasted. The
starch and proteins push out the water and crystalize, hardening
the food, but heating the bagel reverses the process, he said.
   ``This is part of the research I've been doing, to see how the
water redistributed itself,'' he said.
   The technique _ known as inverse gas chromatography _
essentially measures a product's potential for absorbing and losing
water.
   Samples are put in a chromatography column, a sensitive
instrument that measures how the water interacts with the food, and
a computer is used to quickly analyze the resulting data.
   ``It's a kind of tool for the development of new products and
also to do quality control on existing products,'' Solberg said.
   By knowing how long food will last, manufacturers can offer
consumers fresher products and reduce costs and waste. They also
may be able to reduce the use of preservatives, Rutgers researchers
say.
   ``It won't eliminate the need for preservatives but it will give
a better feel for when a preservative is needed,'' Solberg said.
   The accuracy of current methods of determining shelf life
varies, scientists say. Methods range from putting items on a shelf
and waiting several years to see how long they last to accelerating
the aging process by raising the temperature.
   ``My method works in standard temperatures but I use very small
amounts of material and an apparatus that's very sensitive so I can
measure very small rates of change,'' Gilbert said.
   In the United States alone, millions of dollars worth of food
are lost to spoilage each year, said Robert Buchanan at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's research center in Philadelphia.
   Other scientists declined to comment on Gilbert's technique on
the grounds that they did not have enough information.
   ``I've never heard of anything like this before,'' said Kevin
Hicks, another USDA research leader in Philadelphia. ``It sounds
very original. It also sounds very difficult, but perhaps
promising.''
   Fergus M. Clydesdale, head of the Department of Food Science and
Nutrition at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said ``I
think it's an interesting application (of the technology) but it
isn't going to change the color of the sky.''

<HEAD>Nation's Biggest Grocery Chain Braced Against Takeover Threats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kroger Co., the nation's largest grocery
chain, has proposed a $3.8 billion restructuring plan to shield
itself against any hostile takeover bids.
   The Cincinnati-based company said Tuesday it was considering a
plan that would make Kroger an unattractive takeover target by
raising its stock price, loading it up with new debt, placing 20
percent of its shares under control of its employees and selling
off parts of the company.
   The proposal followed news that the Haft family of Maryland
received federal antitrust clearance to acquire Kroger stock and
pushed Kroger shares sharply higher.
   Kroger stock soared by $11.75 a share to $51.25 in heavy trading
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Under the restructuring, shareholders would get a one-time cash
dividend of $40 per share and would receive long-term bonds worth
another $8 a share, while retaining their Kroger common stock.
   Based on its 78.57 million common shares outstanding, it would
cost about $3.15 billion to pay the dividends. Kroger also would
have to borrow another $630 million to cover the bonds.
   ``By continuing as an independent company, the interests of our
employees, customers and the communities in which we operate would
also be protected,'' said Kroger Chairman Lyle Everingham.
   Kroger's directors will meet ``in the very near future'' to vote
on the plan, company representative Paul Bernish said.
   Directors met in emergency session Friday to prepare the
protection plan only hours after the Federal Trade Commission told
the Hafts they could buy Kroger stock without violating anti-trust
laws.
   The Hafts have launched a number of major raids against grocery
companies and other retailers, including unsuccessful but
profitable hostile bids for Safeway, Supermarkets General and Stop
n' Shop. It was not known how much Kroger stock the Hafts own,
although they must disclose when they acquire 5 percent or more of
the company's outstanding shares.
   The FTC clearance was the first official sign of the Hafts'
interest in Kroger, although Kroger stock has has traded heavily
over the past five months amid rumors the Hafts and other potential
acquirers were interested in the company. Representatives of the
Hafts declined to comment.
   Kroger reported sales of almost $18 billion in 1987. It operates
1,317 supermarkets nationwide as well as 900 convenience stores,
and employs 170,000 people.
   Kroger said it will repay the debt incurred in the restructuring
using cash flow from operations, reducing expenses and selling
assets. In a 1986 restructuring, Kroger sold its chain of SupeRx
retail drugstores, and Kroger has worked since July to sell off its
unprofitable chain of Florida Choice supermarkets and liquor stores
in Florida.
   Analysts said the proposed restructuring, if undertaken,
probably would be enough to scare off any would-be hostile buyers.
   The dividend portion of the plan alone would cost $377 million a
year in interest, assuming a rate of 12 percent, estimated William
Flyg, vice president of Big Bear Inc., the Columbus, Ohio-based
grocery chain that competes with Kroger in Columbus. That would
exceed Kroger's 1987 pre-tax income of $315.6 million.
   Kroger could raise between $800 million and $900 million from
asset sales, said Gary M. Giblen, vice president of the investment
firm of Rotan-Mosle Inc.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Weighs Tougher Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation to impose tougher economic
sanctions on white-dominated South Africa is under examination by a
sharply divided Senate panel, with opponents saying the bill would
limit the options of the next U.S. president.
   Although the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was expected to
approve the sanctions bill on a narrow, party-line vote today,
supporters conceded they had neither the votes to shut off debate
on the Senate floor nor to override a near-certain veto by
President Reagan should the bill pass.
   The bill, intended as a follow-up to a set of milder sanctions
enacted over a Reagan veto in 1986, would require an end to most
trade with South Africa and the withdrawal of most U.S. business
investment from the racially divided nation.
   The House approved similar legislation on Aug. 11.
   Republican opponents of the measure passed up an opportunity
last week to vote on amendments as some GOP senators said changes
might make the bill more acceptable and therefore harder to oppose.
   The 1986 sanctions bill was supported by a broad coalition of
senators from both parties.
   But only a few Republicans have indicated they are ready to
support a stronger set of sanctions, with some contending that a
trade embargo and disinvestment would end any leverage the United
States may have to encourage Pretoria to end the country's system
of forced racial separation and control known as apartheid.
   They also said that adopting the sanctions bill now would
foreclose the options of the next president whether he be
Republican George Bush, who opposes sanctions, or Democrat Michael
Dukakis, who favors them.
   The State Department also opposes the legislation, contending
its passage might disrupt U.S.-mediated talks among South Africa,
Angola and Cuba aimed at South African withdrawal from the
territory of South West Africa, or Namibia, and the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola.
   Democrats said the bill represents the only remaining means of
sending a strong signal to South Africa that the United States is
willing to pay a price to end the apartheid system.
   They said the issue is a moral one, not political, and that
sanctions represent the only available way to forestall a violent
revolution inside South Africa by moving that country toward
multiracial democratic rule.

<HEAD>Takeover Strategist Perelman Sells Stake In TW Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald O. Perelman has sold his 15 percent stake
in TW Services Inc. for about $137 million, the latest in a string
of asset sales by the billionaire takeover strategist.
   Perelman, who is chairman of Revlon Inc., sold 7.23 million
shares of TW Services, a major food services company, for $19
apiece on Tuesday, according to Revlon vice chairman Donald Drapkin.
   Last Friday, Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc. agreed to
sell its Technicolor Holdings Inc. film processing business to
Britain's Carlton Communications PLC for $780 million.
   In addition, Perelman reportedly has agreed to sell his
Consolidated Cigar Corp. to a leveraged buyout group for $125
million.
   The moves, which reportedly have raised Perelman's takeover
warchest to about $2 billion, have fueled speculation that the
accomplished takeover strategist was looking for major targets.
   Perelman, who acquired Technicolor in 1982, won a bitter
takeover fight for Revlon in 1985 and has made several,
unsuccessful overtures to Gillette Co. since late 1986.
   He has developed a reputation as a builder rather than a
speculative corporate raider, boosting profits at Revlon and
Technicolor during his stewardship of those companies.
   The sale of a 15 percent chunk of TW Services also has raised
speculation that the food services company might be a takeover
target. Stock in TW, which operates the Denny's and Hardee's fast
food chains among others, rose $1.62{ to $20.62{ a share in heavy
New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday.
   Drapkin said Perelman was supportive of TW management, and had
not sold his TW shares to the company.

   Oregon's strawberry harvest yielded a

Oregon Agricultural Statistics Service said.
   The harvest, picked from 7,800 acres, is 8 percent larger than
last year's production of 93.6 million pounds, the service said in
a report released last week. The previous record crop was 100.1
million pounds harvested in 1964 from 13,900 acres.

   Stock prices rose slightly at midday Wednesday as
investors awaited the release of U.S. trade figures for July.
   There was heavy trading and sharp price movements in selected
stocks, spurred by corporate news stories and by takeover
speculation.
   ``Most of the movement (in shares) came from a revival of
takeover rumors,'' said one equity salesman.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 0.3
points, or 0.02 percent, at 1,756.6 at about 12:15 p.m. local time.
   Overall volume was moderate, as 197.0 million shares changed
hands by midday compared with 239.9 million shares at the same time
Tuesday.
   Economists said they expected the U.S. trade figures to show a
narrowing of the country's trade deficit in July.

<HEAD>July Deficit Lowest in Nearly Four Years, Dollar Jumps</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites thruout to UPDATE with trade report, market
reaction. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today reported the lowest monthly trade deficit
in nearly four years, inciting a hectic rally in the dollar, easing
interest rates in the credit markets and boosting the Republican
presidential campaign.
   The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit
shrank to $9.5 billion in July, the lowest monthly imbalance since
December 1984 and substantially better than many economists had
predicted.
   The 28 percent improvement reflected a small increase in exports
and a big decline in imports.
   It was certain to cheer Republican presidential candidate George
Bush, who has been trying to deflect charges from Democrat Michael
Dukakis that the nation's soaring deficits reflect major flaws in
the Reagan economic program.
   But the Commerce Department also revised upward its June deficit
figure to $13.2 billion from $12.5 billion, which would be the
biggest gap since the February shortfall of $14.4 billion.
   Money traders scrambled to buy dollars after today's report was
released, sending the currency sharply higher in value against the
West German mark and Japanese yen.
   In the bond market, a sensitive indicator of inflation and the
economy's direction, the key 30-year Treasury bond rose more than
$7.50 per $1,000 in face amount and its yield fell to 8.98 percent
from 8.99 percent late Tuesday.
   Bond traders were primarily reacting to the big shrinkage in
imports, which suggested the economy may be slowing down and
thereby easing fears of inflation.
   The trade report was issued prior to the opening bell on Wall
Street, but stock traders already had assumed there would be good
news today and drove prices up late Tuesday, encouraged by remarks
from Treasury secretary designate Nicholas F. Brady.
   Brady told a Senate confirmation hearing that he expects the
trade deficit to decline at a ``surprisingly fast'' pace over the
next few years.
   In addition, the Commerce Department said Tuesday that the
deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of U.S. trade,
shrank to $33.3 billion in the second quarter, a 9.8 percent
improvement from a first quarter imbalance of $36.9 billion.
   It was the biggest quarterly improvement since a 20.1 percent
drop in the final three months of last year. The current account
covers trade in merchandise as well as trade in services, which
primarily reflect the flow of investment earnings between countries.
   In other markets Tuesday, oil prices advanced, driven by a rise
in wholesale gasoline prices, which soared on news that refineries
and oil platforms were threatened by a hurricane approaching the
Gulf of Mexico.
   The contract for October delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 7 cents to settle at $14.56
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed up 1.19
cents at 43.81 cents a gallon.
   Elsewhere, the government released a state-by-state report on
unemployment in which Vermont emerged as the best job provider for
its residents. Massachusetts slipped from first place to 10th in
the past year among states with the lowest unemployment rates.
   Vermont posted an unemployment rate of 2.3 percent in July, with
just 6,900 of its workers lacking jobs, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics said.
   Massachusetts' unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 3.6 percent
in July, a full percentage point higher than the same month a year
ago.

<HEAD>Retail Chain Reports Second Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc., suffering
sluggish sales and still recovering from the high cost of the
Campeau Corp. takeover, reported a $100 million loss in the second
quarter.
   A representative of the Toronto-based Campeau said Tuesday the
loss was due to continuing weak retail sales and the costs
associated with its $8.8 billion takeover of Federated last May.
   Federated's second-quarter loss compares with $30 million in
earnings, or 32 cents a share, in the same period last year.
   For the period ended July 30, Federated reported in a Securities
and Exchange Commission filing it had interest costs of $132.1
million related to Campeau's hostile takeover of the retailer. Its
sales in the period dropped to $970.5 million from $2.4 billion in
the year-ago period, the company said.
   Campeau said previously that costs associated with Federated's
unsuccessful takeover fight contributed to a $128 million loss at
Federated in the first quarter.
   Despite the lower overall sales, three of Federated's divisions
posted increases in revenue, while two reported declines, due
mainly to ``mediocre ready-to-wear sales,'' the company said.
   Bloomingdales showed a .7 percent increase in sales during the
period, Atlanta-based Rich's gained .8 percent and Miami-based
Burdine's advanced 1.5 percent.
   Sales declined .3 percent at Cincinnati-based Lazarus and were
down 2.3 percent at Brooklyn-based Abraham & Straus, Federated said.
   Campeau has agreed to sell Federated's Filene's and Foley's
divisions to May Department Stores for $1.5 billion, and the former
I. Magnin and Bullock's-Bullocks Wilshire, which were sold to R.H.
Macy & Co. for $1.1 billion.
   Last week Campeau agreed to sell Federated's 76-store Gold
Circle discount chain for $325 million.
   Campeau's other retailing unit, Allied Stores Corp., lost $107
million in the second quarter ended July 30, compared with a loss
of $44 million in the same period last year, the company said.
   The latest period included a charge of $10 million on the sale
of Brooks Brothers and a charge of $17 million representing the
company's indirect share in Federated's loss for the period.

   The stock market rolled up a broad gain today,
responding to better-than-expected news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 12.27 to
2,095.31 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 774 up, 217 down and
446 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 32.10 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit shrank to $9.53 billion in July from a revised gap of
$13.22 billion the month before.
   Wall Street analysts had generally been looking for a july
figure in the $11 billion to $11.5 billion range.
   Of particular note, brokers said, was a substantial drop in
imports. That was taken as a sign that the momentum of the domestic
economy was slowing in response to recent credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve.
   A moderation of economic growth would presumably allow the Fed
to pursue a less restrictive credit policy, encouraging steady to
lower interest rates.
   The dollar rose in foreign exchange following the trade report,
and interest rates fell in the credit markets.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Merck rose ] to 58[; Exxon \
to 45[; Philip Morris ~ to 97]; Coca-Cola { to 42|, and General
Electric [ to 42{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .72 to 151.87. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.44 at 298.23.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average ended 10.67 points
higher at 2,083.04.
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 705 issues up, 681 down and 545
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 162.49 million shares,
up from 114.88 million in Monday's session.

   The dollar soared against major foreign currencies
in Europe Wednesday after the U.S. government reported a
larger-than-expected drop in the country's July trade deficit.
   Gold prices rose slightly in the morning.
   The dollar jumped immediately after the Commerce Department said
the U.S. merchandise trade gap narrowed to $9.5 billion in July
from a revised $13.2 billion in June. The department previously
reported the June deficit as $12.5 billion.
   The markets had expected a July trade shortfall of about $11.2
billion.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6822 by late afternoon
after the trade report was released. That compared with $1.6915 at
midmorning and $1.6965 Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates after the trade report was released, with
midmorning rates in parentheses, and compared with late Tuesday,
were: 1.8702 (1.8520) West German marks, up from 1.8470; 1.5760
(1.5605) Swiss francs, up from 1.5600; 6.3640 (6.3020) French
francs, up from 6.2935; 2.1106 (2.0892) Dutch guilders, up from
2.0845; 1,392.00 (1,381.75) Italian lire, up from 1,380.50; and
1.2263 (1.2265) Canadian dollars, down from 1.2307.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.38 yen to close at 133.45 yen.
   Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 134.40 yen after the
trade report and 133.45 yen before.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $421.90 a troy ounce,
and at mid-morning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $421.90. Both bid prices were up from the
$420.00 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $421.45 an ounce, up slightly from
$421.00 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 76 cents to close at a bid of
$423.45 an ounce.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.49 a troy

   Heckert described Woolard as ``an exceedingly competent
businessman, familiar with all aspects of Du Pont's operations, as
well as a determined and inspiring leader.''
   Woolard, 54, joined Du Pont in 1957 as an industrial engineer at
the Kinston, N.C., plant. He held a succession of manufacturing and
marketing positions in the fibers business, eventually serving as
general manager and later vice president.
   In 1983, he became an executive vice president, with
responsibillity for what are now Du Pont's agricultural products,
medical products, imaging systems and electronics businesses.

   Oil futures prices surged in early trading today
on a string of bullish factors, including news that a hurricane
threatens U.S. crude production along the Gulf of Mexico coast.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, was
quoted 57 cents higher at $15.12 a 42-gallon barrel shortly after
the market opened, from Tuesday's settlement price of $14.56.
   Contracts had traded between $14.33 a barrel and $14.70 a barrel
Tuesday after Monday's whiplash session in which prices dropped to
a near two-year low of $13.75 before rebounding to settle at $14.49.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery zoomed 1.94
cents a gallon in early trading to 45.80 cents from Tuesday's close
of 43.81 cents a gallon.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract also was up sharply,
trading about 1.22 cents a gallon higher than its close of 41.83
cents a gallon on Tuesday.
   ``This could be one of the wildest trading days with all the
news,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders Futures
Inc. in New York.
   Analysts said today's market was continuing the bullish
sentiment started Tuesday on concerns that refineries and oil
platforms were being evacuated in anticipation of the approaching
storm.
   ``If the hurricane hits the Gulf coast, there's concern about
short-term gasoline supplies,'' said Chris McCormack, an energy
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Analysts said that although Hurricane Gilbert had not damaged
the Gulf oil fields, between 600,000 and 800,000 gallons a day of
gasoline could be lost if production was halted to wait out the
storm.
   Meanwhile, this morning's market also reacted strongly to an
announcement by OPEC Secretary General Subroto that the cartel's
pricing committee had set a meeting date of Sept. 25-26.
   The announcement generates hope that the 13-member Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries will call for a full meeting of
the cartel to set production limits and curb the ouput that has
flooded world oil markets and eroded prices, analysts said.
   Meanwhile, oil brokers were saying this week that the recent dip
in oil prices had not affected retail prices yet but by winter
consumers could realize some benefits at the pump.
   ``If we see another $2 slide in (oil) prices, then consumer
gasoline prices could be expected to go 7 to 8 cents lower when
it's all over _ by Thanksgiving,'' said Stephen Smith, an analyst
with Bear Stearns & Co.
   Other oil brokers said that if crude prices remained between the
$13.50 and $15.50 levels in the next several weeks, retail gasoline
prices could decline by about 2 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Somebody at the Internal Revenue Service
forgot to look at the calendar _ and the goof could cost the
government as much as $100 million in taxes.
   The IRS confirmed today that it was one day late in filing a
notice of appeal in an important case _ an appeal that some legal
experts expect the IRS would have won. An agency spokesman disputed
the estimate of what the error could cost.
   On May 26, the U.S. Tax Court entered a decision holding that
the IRS was wrong in requiring AT&T to pay tax currently on
customer security deposits. Under the law, the agency had 90 days
to appeal, a period that ended Aug. 24. The notice of appeal was
filed Aug. 25.
   ``Underscoring this embarrassment is the fact that the service
prevailed in the only appellate decision addressing the issue
presented in the AT&T case,'' reported Tax Notes, an authoritative
tax journal. The publication noted a previous appeals court verdict
in favor of the IRS in a Florida case involving security deposits
paid by gas customers.
   A similar case, involving deposits paid to Indianapolis Power &
Light Co., has been appealed by the IRS to the 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals. Despite the error in the AT&T case, IRS spokesman Frank
Keith said today, ``IRS has no intention of abandoning its position
on customer deposits.''
   Tax Notes estimated the goof could cost $100 million in disputed
taxes and interest. Keith contended, however, that because the
issue is essentially one of when taxes should be paid, the
potential loss would be less.

   Mitchell joined GM in 1935 and within a year became chief
designer for the Cadillac studio. In 1954, he was named director of
styling, a post he held until being named vice president.
   Survivors include his wife, Marian, three daughters and four
grandchildren.
   A funeral service has been scheduled for Friday.

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its star
high-yield bond trader Michael Milken have issued wide-ranging
subpoenas for evidence to defend themselves against the Securities
and Exchange Commission's massive fraud case.
   Notice of some of the subpoenas, filed Tuesday in Manhattan
federal court, reflected the investment firm's intention to
undertake an aggressive defense against the SEC civil charges
announced last week after a nearly two-year probe stemming from the
Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.
   Unlike restrictive pretrial fact-finding rules for defendants in
criminal cases, defendants in civil suits enjoy broad subpoena
rights to seek testimony and other evidence used in the accusations
against them.
   Drexel, Milken and three other employees of the firm were
accused by the SEC of scheming with Boesky to profit on insider
trading, manipulate stock, cheat clients, keep phony books and
other fraudulent acts. The SEC suit also named Miami financier
Victor Posner, his son Steven and a Posner-controlled company,
Pennsylvania Engineering Corp.
   Those subpoenaed by the defense don't yet include Boesky, the
one-time Wall Street speculator and imprisoned insider trader who
negotiated a plea-bargain cooperation agreement with the government
and implicated Drexel and the others.
   It was unclear why the Drexel team of defense lawyers have not
yet sought testimony from Boesky. Martin Flumenbaum, a Milken
attorney identified as the lead lawyer in the subpoena notice, did
not return telephone calls for comment.
   Regardless of whether Boesky's testimony is sought, lawyers
familiar with the case have predicted the Manhattan U.S. attorney's
office, which has been conducting a criminal probe of Drexel and
Milken, would likely move to nullify any Boesky subpoena on grounds
it could compromise the investigation.
   According to the defense notice filed in court, those subpoenaed
include investment businesses once linked to Boesky, several
Manhattan art galleries once patronized by Boesky, as well as the
Washington law firm of Fried, Frank, Jacobson, Harris & Shriver,
which helped negotiate his plea agreement.
   Defense lawyers also are seeking any audio or video tape
recordings held by the government in connection with the Drexel
case.
   There has been speculation that Boesky secretly taped
discussions with Milken while cooperating with the government in
1986, before the announcement that he would settle SEC insider
trading charges by paying $100 million in illicit profits and
fines, as well as plead guilty to a criminal charge.
   The court notice didn't identify other recipients of subpoenas.
But the Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified people it said were
familiar with the case as saying they included numerous potential
witnesses, including former employees of Boesky-controlled
organizations.

   The stock market gained ground today in a
lukewarm response to better-than-expected news on international
trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points in
the early going, showed a 4.98 gain at 2,088.02 by 11 a.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 697 up, 481 down and
532 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 65.64 million shares at
midmorning.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit shrank to $9.53 billion in July from a revised gap of
$13.22 billion the month before.
   Wall Street analysts had generally been looking for a July
figure in the $11 billion to $11.5 billion range.
   Of particular note, brokers said, was a substantial drop in
imports. That was taken as a sign that the momentum of the domestic
economy was slowing in response to recent credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve.
   A moderation of economic growth would presumably allow the Fed
to pursue a less restrictive credit policy, encouraging steady to
lower interest rates.
   The dollar rose in foreign exchange following the trade report,
and interest rates fell in the credit markets.
   But stock traders shied away from bidding up stocks
aggressively, suggesting that the market was still not over its
late-summer malaise.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose { to 97 and
Coca-Cola added \ to 42], while International Business Machines
dropped } to 114\, and General Electric was down [ at 42\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .18 to 151.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .49 at 297.28.

<HEAD>GM Says Public Wants Larger, More Powerful Cars</HEAD>

   The public wants larger, more powerful cars,
and tighter fuel economy standards would result in lost jobs,
General Motors Corp. said today in a federal hearing on the
gasoline mileage rules.
   ``This regulation flies against the basic forces of economics,''
said Richard Klimisch, GM's environmental activities executive
director. ``The consumer is reacting to gasoline prices which are
lower than anyone expected, so the consumer does not rank fuel
economy as a top priority.''
   Environmentalists, also testifying at the hearing, said in a
news conference Tuesday that looser fuel-economy standards would
contribute to environmental damage, including a warming of the
global climate.
   The hearing by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration was taking public comment on a proposal to set the
corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standard at 26.5 miles per
gallon to 27.5 mpg.
   Without the new rule, the standard would revert to the 27.5 mpg
voted by Congress in 1975. It has been set at 26 mpg since 1986
under an exception allowed by NHTSA.
   The fuel-economy law, adopted to reduce imported petroleum
consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices, sets a maximum
level of fuel consumption each automaker's fleet of passenger cars,
on average, must meet.
   GM's customers choose cars in part based on gasoline prices, and
with the price at the pump running below $1 per gallon in much of
the nation, car buyers see little value in features that save fuel,
Klimisch said.
   Should the standard be placed at 27.5 mpg, GM would be forced to
cut back on large-car production at its Arlington, Texas, plant at
a cost of 60,000 jobs to GM and its suppliers in 1989 and 110,000
jobs in 1990, Klimisch said.
   Car buyers, faced with a shortage of higher-powered GM cars,
would buy from foreign automakers, buy light trucks that come under
different standards or drive older, less fuel-efficient cars
longer, Klimisch said.
   Eventually, GM might be forced to increase the percentage of
foreign-made parts in its cars to meet the demands of the
marketplace, he said.
   The automaker estimates it might be able to meet a standard of
about 27.1 mpg without job losses, but to make sure of that, in
light of the uncertainties of sales forecasts and test results, it
needs a standard of 26.7 mpg or less, he said.
   A coalition of 20 environmental groups called for stiffening of
the standards to avoid contributing to global warming.
   ``If you liked this summer's heat and droughts, you'll love the
results of this policy,'' said Thomas B. Stoel Jr., international
program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``In
view of what the scientists are telling us about global warming, it
is hard to imagine a more irresponsible proposal.''
   Researchers have predicted that manmade emissions of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere will raise the average global temperature
significantly during the next century, causing changes in weather
patterns, crop growth and increased sea levels from polar melting.
   Carbon dioxide tends to trap heat in the atmosphere rather than
allowing it to radiate back into space, a phenomenon called the
``greenhouse effect.''
   Automobiles account for about 25 percent of U.S. emissions of
carbon dioxide, Stoel said.
   ``If the U.S. auto fleet could be brought up to an average of 45
mpg by the year 2005, this one action would reduce U.S. carbon
dioxide emissions by about 15 percent,'' he said.
   Loosening the standard from 27.5 mpg to 26 mpg would increase
carbon dioxide emissions over the estimated 106,000-mile life of
each affected car by about 1.6 tons or 4 percent, according to
figures presented by Energy Conservation Coalition.

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The copper-mining town of Cananea has
come to symbolize the birth of Mexico's nationalist spirit in the
82 years since a bloody strike pitted Mexican workers against an
American mine owner.
   Today a new generation of Cananea miners says a government plan
to return the nationalized, but debt-ridden copper company to the
private sector is like selling a historical landmark.
   ``This is a national patrimony. We feel it in our souls,'' said
Joaquin Quijano Salazar, general secretary of National Miners Union
Section 65, representing 3,000 workers at Cananea, 25 miles south
of the Arizona border in Sonora state.
   Under a plan to reduce government subsidies and help Mexico
overcome its severe economic crisis, the administration of
President Miguel de la Madrid has sold many nonessential
state-owned companies, most of them money losers.
   The sale of the Cananea mine would be by far the biggest
transfer undertaken, but it now appears a final decision will be up
to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, due to take office as president in
December.
   Since the failure of a $910 million bid by Protexa, based in
this northern industrial city, the development bank handling the
sale said the government has received no new offers.
   In a written response to a list of questions directed to its
Mexico City headquarters, the National Financiera bank said Cananea
now could be sold as a package deal along with another Sonora
copper mining operation, Mexicana del Cobre.
   Unofficial reports say the government will ask for $2 billion
for the two mines, but Quijano said that the union opposes the sale.
   ``They can sell a company, but they can't sell workers,'' he
said, adding that some potential buyers want to purchase the mine
without the union contract.
   The Cananea Consolidated Copper Co. was founded by American
entrepeneur William C. Greene in 1899.
   According to ``The Labor Struggle in Cananea 1906,'' published
by the Sonora state government, Greene ran the mine as an American
fiefdom.
   ``The Mexican workers at Cananea were discontented because of
the inequalities that existed between them and the foreign workers
at the same company ... They also found themselves restricted,
almost without exception, to the most arduous and worst paid
jobs,'' the book said.
   On June 1, 1906, 2,000 Mexican miners rallying under the slogan
``Five pesos (then $10) for eight hours work'' went on strike.
   On June 2, according to the book, ``North Americans barricaded
in the main offices ... fired indiscriminately at the Mexicans.''
   Mexican police and soldiers aided by Arizona rangers put down
the rebellion June 5 and jailed its surviving leaders.
   Jose Luis Trueva, a writer who is compiling a history of the
Cananea labor movement, said estimates of the death toll range from
11 to more than 100, including Americans.
   The Mexican dead are remembered throughout Mexico each Labor Day
with shouts of, ``We will not forget the martyrs of Cananea.''
   Although at least 25 labor strikes broke out between 1905 and
1908, the Cananea strike often is credited with sparking the
Mexican labor movement and with helping to launch the Mexican
Revolution of 1910.
   In Cananea, a town of 25,000 people today, a local junior high
school is named ``The Martyrs of 1906'' and two monuments stand in
memory of those who died.
   The Mexican government, which has controlled the operations
since the 1970s, launched a multimillion-dollar expansion project
before the onset of the economic crisis in 1982, said company
spokesman Roberto Rojas.
   Those expenditures, steady devaluations in the peso and the low
price of copper on the international market helped put Cananea's
total debt at the equivalent of $1 billion today, according to
company figures published in the August national business magazine
Expansion.
   But now the improvements are complete, the price of copper is
back up over $1 a pound and Cananea's sales are soaring.
   In 1987 the company had net earnings of $23.3 million on sales
of $186.5 million, a 300 percent increase from the year before,
according to Expansion.
   Rojas estimated production this year at 125,652 metric tons of
pure copper.
   Quijano said the government has treated workers better than any
of the private owners, who he said ``carried off everything and
left us nothing.''
   Said Quijano, ``Now that it's making money they want to sell it.
We hope they don't find any buyers.''

<HEAD>Ameritech Plans to Sell Computer Software Unit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ameritech says it has agreed to sell Applied Data
Research, its computer software subsidiary, for $170 million, or
about $45 million less than it paid for the unit two years ago.
   Ameritech said Tuesday that Computer Associates International of
Garden City, N.Y., which was one of several firms that looked into
buying ADR, has agreed to buy the software unit.
   Two years ago, Ameritech paid $215 million for ADR and poured
millions of dollars into research and development. The software
unit is believed to have lost money in 1986 and 1987.
   ADR is a major supplier of computer software to the Army and Air
Force.
   If it follows its pattern in other acquisitions, Computer
Associates will make large staff cuts at ADR, which has between
1,600 and 1,700 employees, industry analysts said.
   Computer Associates officials said they had not yet decided what
to do.
   ``We have very little product overlap with ADR, so we might not
do that much,'' said Michael Fisher, senior vice president at
Computer Associates. ``I'm not going to say we won't. We will do
what makes sense.''
   Ameritech had been rumored to be negotiating to sell ADR to
Fujitsu Inc., a Japanese company.
   Computer Associates, a leading software company, had sales of
$709 million last year, and has spent more than $1 billion since
1982 to acquire other firms.

   Chase Manhattan Corp., one of the nation's
largest bank holding companies, may move nearly a third of its
16,000 employees from its New York headquarters to New Jersey,
according to a report published Wednesday.
   The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed real estate and banking
sources, said Chase Chairman Williard C. Butcher favors building a
1.5-milion-square-foot facility in Jersey City, N.J., to house
operations and technical employees.
   His recommendations are expected to be made at a Sept. 21 board
meeting, the sources said.
   Chase spokesman Steven Rautenberg said Wednesday that the bank
``has been looking for alternate sites for our back office but we
haven't reached a decision yet.''
   ``We're looking ... in New York as well as New Jersey,'' he said.
   New York Deputy Mayor Alair Townsend said Wednesday that the
city was aware of Chase's proposals to relocate and was making a
last-ditch effort to convince them to stay.
   Chase's corporate headquarters still would remain in New York's
financial district, the Journal said.
   ``We've been talking with Chase for well over a year ... We're
still having discussions with them,'' said Ms. Townsend, the city's
deputy mayor for finance and economic development.
   She said she planned to deliver some final information on
possible alternate sites in Brooklyn.
   But the Journal story said that Chase and lawyers from the
Lefrak organization, which is developing a complex in Jersey City,
already have agreed on major terms.
   After J.C. Penney and Mobil Oil Co. moved their respective
headquarters out of New York, the city initiated an agressive
campaign, complete with tax breaks and energy savings, to halt
corporate defections.
   The city sued American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to keep it from
moving some employees to New Jersey and convinced NBC to remain in
New York by offering an estimated $100 million tax savings over 35
years.

   American business is picking up a strong message:
You can sell to Japan. It may not be easy, but it's not impossible.
   Washington is heavily promoting an export drive as a major
component of the Reagan administration's strategy to reduce the
U.S. trade deficit, especially with Japan, which had a $60 billion
surplus in trade with the United States last year.
   The dollar's drop over the past three years has helped by making
Japanese goods more expensive to buy in the United States, but if
the Japanese do not buy more U.S.-made products, the U.S. deficit
will never disappear.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity led executives of 25
American consumer-products companies to Japan over the past week to
promote their entry into the Japanese market. The trip appears to
have met with some success.
   ``The experience has been very enlightening, to say the least,''
Norman Jacobs, vice president of Eastpak, said of his look at the
fashion luggage market in Tokyo.
   ``We never really intended to get into exporting in this stage
of our development,'' he said, describing his Boston-based
company's growth as averaging 35 percent a year for 11 years while
concentrating mostly on the U.S. market for fashionable bags.
   Jacobs said his company had noticed some Japanese travelers had
bought Eastpak goods and then reordered.
   ``We thought at first we were selling because of style but were
over-priced,'' he said. But after spending a few days looking at
the market in Tokyo, he said, ``I was very surprised to find we are
very price-competitive.''
   The Verity-led mission was Jacobs' first trip to Japan, he said.
``This has opened up a brand new horizon to us, and we're going to
be back as often as it takes.''
   Jacobs' reaction to Japanese price levels is typical of
first-time American visitors. Calculated in today's devalued
dollars, everything is expensive here. But the Japanese are used to
current prices in yen, since this country has negligible inflation,
and many people have incomes high enough to sustain luxury buying
by U.S. standards.
   At a meeting with reporters last weekend, Verity said he was
leading the trade mission to alert more American businesses to the
opportunity in exporting. American companies are not oriented to
the world market because they think they are doing well enough in
the big U.S. market, he said.
   ``If you feel we're hand-holding, you're right,'' Verity said.
   He said he hoped to see the U.S. trade deficit down 15 percent
to 20 percent in 1988. ``That is what our export-promotion program
is all about,'' he said, predicting that in the coming years the
U.S. economy will be driven by exports.
   Some significant improvement in trade has already been
registered, according to the latest figures released by the U.S.
government. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit shrank to $9.5 billion in July, the
lowest monthly imbalance since December 1984.
   The dramatic 28 percent improvement in the trade deficit
reflected a small increase in exports and a big decline in imports.
   Verity said he was disappointed that U.S. construction companies
had not shown much interest in the opening that Washington
bargained hard to win on major construction projects in Japan. But
he predicted they would jump into the market when they saw Japanese
contracts going to other foreign countries.
   During Verity's week-long mission, the Harry Winston jewelry
firm opened a shop in central Tokyo and Winnebago Industries,
makers of recreational vehicles, got a lavish promotional party for
its linkup with Mitsubishi Corp., which will market
Iowa-manufactured Winnebago vehicles in Japan.
   Other companies on the mission had meetings with potential
Japanese distributors and sought openings for products ranging from
furniture and sporting goods to yachts, processed foods and pet
foods.
   The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo says recent trade promotions have
succeeded beyond expectations.
   Suzanne Hale of the embassy's agriculture trade office said a
U.S. food show this summer drew 6,000 visitors when 3,000 to 4,000
had been expected. Sales made at the show totaled $7.5 million and
exhibitors projected sales would increase by $133 million in the
coming year as a result of the show, she said.

   Share prices finished higher Wednesday on the
London Stock Exchange as the market shrugged off the report of a
narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit in July.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 8.8
points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,765.1.
   Volume was 394.6 million shares, compared with 369.2 million
shares traded Tuesday.
   The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $9.53 billion in July from a
revised $13.34 billion gap in June. Many analysts had been looking
for a deficit of about $11.5 billion for July.
   Experts said London shares failed to react to the U.S. trade
news because there are still grave concerns facing the British
economy, particularly its own trade deficit problem.
   ``The subdued response to the figures can only be attributed to
the fact that institutional sentiment remains unenthusiastic
towards the U.K. market,'' one analyst said.
   Paul Harrison, a director at County NatWest WoodMac in London,
said interest rate concerns continue to weigh on the British market.
   ``There were some worries in the back of people's minds that
with the dollar surging and sterling under pressure, there might be
another round of interest rate increases to lift the pound,'' he
said.
   Several market watchers said traders in London found it
disturbing that Wall Street did not sustain an advance on the trade
figures.
   In New Yorrk, the Dow Jones industrial average was up only 2.31
points to 2,085.35 by the close of trading in London.
   In London, the Financial Times 30-share index rose 6.7 points to
1,416.5. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 4.7 points to
998.61.

   Following the lead of Pan Am Corp., several major U.S. airlines
have sharply reduced their air fares to Europe.
   Pan Am on Tuesday announced a new round-trip restricted fare of
$298 to London from New York, Washington, Detroit and Miami. The
new fare represents a 41 percent cut from the airline's previous
lowest fare of $508 for the same route, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon said Wednesday.
   In addition to the London ``Super Eurosaver,'' Pan Am said it
also is offering new ``Eurosaver'' fares to 22 other European
cities that are up to 30 percent cheaper.
   American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines
Inc. quickly said they would match the new fares in the markets
where they compete with Pan Am. Continental Airlines said it was
studying the possibility of fare cuts, but had made no decision.
   The reductions are designed to stimulate U.S. passenger traffic
to Europe, which has suffered recently from the dollar's decline
against major foreign currencies.
   In addition, Ms. Hanlon said, it is part of a strategy for Pan
Am to move away from the use of travel consolidators, who buy large
volumes of discounted tickets from airlines, mark them up 10
percent to 20 percent and then resell them to travel agents and
consumers.
   ``It is part of a strategy to move away from the consolidators,
offering a competitive product directly to the public and through
the retail travel agents,'' she said.
   The $298 Pan Am London fare can be used for travel only on
certain days of the week, and the first day of travel must be
between Oct. 16 and Dec. 7. Travel must be completed by Dec. 15.
The non-refundable tickets must be purchased 45 days in advance,
except for those bought before Sept. 30.
   ``Eurosaver'' fares to other European cities must be purchased
30 days in advance and within 48 hours of making the reservation.
They also are non-refundable. The cities include Paris; Rome;
Frankfurt, West Germany; Athens, Greece; Brussels, Belgium; and
Zurich, Switzerland.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit shrank to
$9.5 billion in July, the lowest monthly imbalance since December
1984, the government said today in a report that sent stock prices
higher.
   The Commerce Department said the dramatic 28 percent improvement
in the trade deficit reflected a small increase in exports and a
big decline in imports.
   The latest trade deficit was certain to cheer Republican
presidential candidate George Bush, who has been trying to deflect
charges from Democrat Michael Dukakis that the country's soaring
trade deficits demonstrate a major flaw in the Reagan economic
program.
   The July deficit was substantially better than economists had
expected. The government did, however, boost the June deficit to
$13.2 billion from the originally reported $12.5 billion.
   The June deficit was the biggest trade shortfall since a $14.4
billion deficit in February, a figure that had sent the Dow Jones
industrial average tumbling by 100 points.
   The July deficit had the opposite effect.
   By early afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average was up more
than 7 points. At one point in the first hour of trading, the
average had risen more than 17 points.
   President Reagan hailed the report, telling an audience in Cape
Girardeau, Mo., that it was ``very good'' news. He added:
   ``The message is going out to every corner of the world: When
America goes into the market to compete, we play to win. Others may
talk; we deliver.''
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said in a statement that,
``compared with the same seven months of last year, exports surged
28 percent while imports rose less than 10 percent.''
   Jay Goldinger, an economist with Capital Insight, a Los Angeles
investment firm, predicted that the deficit figures would likely
remain in the single-digit range in coming months as U.S.
manufacturers continue to reap the benefits from the decline in the
value of the dollar.
   ``Our exports continue to climb because our goods are cheaper
and imports are declining because we have finally found a price
high enough to stop consumers from buying imported goods,'' he said.
   A weaker dollar, in addition to making U.S. products cheaper on
overseas markets, makes imports more expensive for American
consumers.
   For the first seven months of this year, the U.S. trade deficit
has been running at an annual average of $137.5 billion, down 19.3
percent from the record $170.3 billion deficit suffered in 1987.
   The significant narrowing in the trade deficit this year has
been a major factor behind the economy's better-than-expected
economic performance. Analysts said that more than half of all
economic growth this year is coming from the narrowing trade gap.
   U.S. exports are booming as the weaker dollar has made American
goods competitive once again on world markets, a factor that has
helped push factory operating rates to the highest level in eight
years.
   The $9.5 billion July imbalance between exports and imports was
only the second single-digit deficit in the last three years and
was the lowest since a $8.03 billion deficit in December 1984. The
deficit had declined to $9.76 billion in May.
   The July improvement reflected a big 8.9 percent drop in
imports, which declined to $35.99 billion from a record June figure
of $39.50 billion.
   Exports were up by a smaller 0.7 percent to $26.5 billion,
keeping them near the record levels they have been at for the last
several months.
   The big drop in imports came primarily in big-ticket capital
goods, which dropped by $1.2 billion to $8 billion. This category
had risen sharply the previous month as U.S. companies had looked
abroad for the equipment needed to expand their own production
facilities.
   Also dropping sharply in July were car imports, which fell by
$803 million with almost all of that decline coming from a drop in
shipments of cars from Canada.
   On the export side, the improvement reflected increases in a
variety of products, led by a $600 million rise in sales of capital
goods.
   As usual, the country suffered its biggest deficit with Japan, a
$4.4 billion imbalance, which was unchanged from June. The deficit
with Western Europe rose to $2.3 billion from $1.9 billion in June.
The deficits with Taiwan and Canada were unchanged at $1.2 billion
and $1.1 billion, respectively.
   With the release of today's report, the government resumed a
practice abandoned in 1979 of simultaneously reporting the import
figures with the cost of shipping and insurance removed.
   Using this system, the deficit for July would have been an even
lower $8.07 billion, down from a June imbalance, minus shipping and
insurance, of $11.7 billion.
   The monthly merchandise trade figure for July was the second
good report on trade in as many days. The government said Tuesday
that the deficit in the current account for the April-June quarter
shrank by 9.8 percent to $33.3 billion. This report includes not
only the trade in merchandise which is reported on a monthly bass
but also trade in services, mainly the flow of investment earnings
across borders.
   In a second upbeat report today, the government said that U.S.
industrial production posted a moderate 0.2 percent increase in
August reflecting in part the boom in manufacturing caused by
foreign sales.

<HEAD>Dollar Jumps In Europe On Trade Figures, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An AM version from New York expected by 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improved U.S. trade figures pushed the dollar
sharply higher in active trading in Europe Wednesday, but the
currency was prevented from rising further by fear of central bank
intervention.
   Gold prices also rose.
   The dollar inched up in the morning and was trading at about
1.8550 West German marks when the Commerce Department announced
that the U.S. trade deficit in July was $9.5 billion, considerably
narrower than the $11 billion to $12 billion gap that the market
had been expecting.
   The dollar shot up almost two pfennigs and then subsided
slightly to about 1.8700 marks before rising again late in the day.
   Dealers said the dollar's rise was curtailed by fear that the
central banks would seek to knock the currency down. Those fears
were followed by unconfirmed reports later in New York that the
Federal Reserve had stepped in to sell dollars.
   In London, the dollar soared against the British pound. It cost
$1.6750 to buy one pound, cheaper than late Tuesday's $1.6965.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8783 West German marks, up from 1.8470; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5600; 6.3915 French francs, up from 6.2935; 2.1155 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0845; 1,399.50 Italian lire, up from 1,380.50;
and 1.2223 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2307.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.38 Japanese yen to close at 133.45 yen. Later in
London it gained further to 134.55 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $421.75 a troy ounce,
compared with $420.00 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to
$421.50 from $421.00 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 76 cents to close at a bid of
$423.45.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.53 a troy ounce, compared
with Tuesday's $6.46.

<TEXT>
   British film producer David Puttnam said Wednesday
he has formed a four-year joint venture with Warner Brothers Inc.
and other international investors to back his next six major
feature films.
   The announcement came about a year after Puttnam, who has
produced such films as ``The Killing Fields'' and ``Chariots of
Fire,'' resigned as chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola Co.'s
Columbia Pictures after completing only 15 months of a three-year
contract.
   Puttnam, 47, left the studio after Coca-Cola merged Columbia
Pictures with Tri-Star Pictures and brought Victor Kaufman in as
president and chief executive of the combined operation.
   During his brief tenure in Hollywood, Puttnam reportedly clashed
with members of the entertainment industry establishment.
   In addition to Warner Brothers and Puttnam's own company Enigma
Productions, the partners in the joint venture are Fujisankei
Communications, Japan's largest mass communications company;
British Satellite Broadcasting and County NatWest Ventures, the
venture capital unit of National Westminster Bank PLC.
   At a news conference, Puttnam refused to disclose the exact size
of each partner's stake, saying only that ``We regard ourselves as
equal partners.''
   He will produce the films through Enigma, which will have a
production fund of $50 million in addition to income it makes from
its films.
   The venture intends to make movies aimed at a broad
international audience.
   ``We all share a perspective which tells us that films can and
should be made for the international marketplace,'' said Terry
Semel, president of Warner Brothers, which is based in Burbank,
Calif.
   Asked if he would continue his efforts to cut production costs,
which proved unpopular in Hollywood, Puttnam said, ``One thing I've
learned is to try and resist ideologies.''
   The producer said he intends to cast ``the best people for the
best films as possible.''
   Warner Brothers' Semel said, ``He can make hit films with both
unknown and known filmmakers.''
   Puttnam said he expects the venture to release its first film in
the autumn of 1990.
   The venture's movies will be distributed worldwide by Warner
Brothers with two exceptions. Fujisankei will be responsible for
video and television distribution in Japan and British Satellite
Broadcasting has acquired the British satellite television rights.
   The Fujisankei group includes the Fuji television network and
the Sankei Shimbun newspapers and publishing companies.

   The stock market moved higher today in a
lukewarm response to better-than-expected news on international
trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 15 points in
the early going, showed an 8.35 gain at 2,091.39 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 766 up, 544 down and
568 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit shrank to $9.53 billion in July from a revised gap of
$13.22 billion the month before.
   Wall Street analysts had generally been looking for a July
figure in the $11 billion to $11.5 billion range.
   Of particular note, brokers said, was a substantial drop in
imports. That was taken as a sign that the momentum of the domestic
economy was slowing in response to recent credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve.
   A moderation of economic growth would presumably allow the Fed
to pursue a less restrictive credit policy, encouraging steady to
lower interest rates.
   The dollar rose in foreign exchange following the trade report,
and interest rates fell in the credit markets.
   But stock traders shied away from bidding up stocks
aggressively, suggesting that the market was still not over its
late-summer malaise.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose { to 97;
Coca-Cola was unchanged at 42[, and International Business Machines
dropped | to 114].
   TW Services climbed 1{ to 22[ in continued speculation about
takeover possibilities following the sale Tuesday of a 14.9 percent
stake in the company by a group led by investor Ronald Perelman.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .32 to 151.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .64 at 297.43.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 126.67 million shares with two
hours to go.

   The Senate today confirmed the nomination of
investment banker Nicholas F. Brady to serve as Treasury secretary
during the remaining four months of the Reagan administration.
   The 92-2 vote installed Brady with time to spare before a
meeting late next week in West Berlin of finance ministers from the
world's industrial powers.
   Senators of both parties were anxious for a strong vote of
confidence to strengthen Brady's hand in the meeting of the G-7, as
the finance ministers' group is known.
   ``If we did not confirm Nick Brady, he would go with a little
bit of a cloud over his head to an important international meeting.
Nothing could serve the Congress or the country more than to give
Nick Brady a unanimous vote of approval,'' Sen. Bob Packwood of
Oregon, ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said
shortly before the vote.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., sounded one of the few discordant
notes, voting against the nomination after criticizing Brady for
saying during his confirmation hearing that the federal government
could grow its way out of the budget deficit.
   ``Mr. Brady says, `Don't worry, we'll grow out of it.' Well the
truth is different and the truth will out,'' Conrad said.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., also voted against the nomination.
   Brady, upon being sworn in, will be the third Treasury secretary
to serve under President Reagan. Donald Regan, who later became
White House chief of staff, held the cabinet post from 1981 to
1985, turning it over to James A. Baker III.
   Although Brady is expected to do little more than serve as a
caretaker this year, he would be the most likely candidate to serve
as Treasury secretary if Republican presidential candidate George
Bush wins.
   The Finance Committee had voted 15-0 on Tuesday to recommend
confirmation of the popular former senator.
   At the committee hearing, Brady promised he would reassure the
G-7 of his intent to continue the economic cooperation policies of
his predecessor.
   The steady decline of the value of the dollar since September
1985, coordinated by the United States and its economic allies, has
been credited with reviving U.S. sales abroad and reducing the
trade deficit this year.
   Brady delivered generally upbeat remarks to the committee on the
prospects of narrowing both the trade gap and the federal budget
deficit.
   He even managed to get credit for a stock market rally late in
the day.
   Responding to senators' concerns that the trade deficit still
was too large, Brady urged them to give U.S. companies time to
respond to the fall in the value of the dollar.
   ``We have to give the system a chance to work. My prediction is
that the trade deficit is going to come down and one of the
surprises of the next two or three years is how fast it will come
down,'' he said.
   Analysts cited the comments as the reason for a last-minute
surge in the price of stocks, which had been slightly lower for
much of the day. Traders apparently interpreted the remarks as
hinting that the government's report on the July trade deficit
would be favorable.
   It was. The government reported today that the deficit shrank to
$9.5 billion, the lowest in nearly four years.
   Brady also said growing overseas investment in the United
States, which has risen as foreigners purchase U.S. assets with the
dollars they earn from selling goods here, can be taken as a sign
of the economy's strength and of foreigners' faith in it.
   On the federal budget deficit, Brady praised both the
administration and Congress for their efforts, which have whittled
the deficit from $220 billion in 1986 to an estimated $150 billion
this year.
   ``I do think we can grow our way out of this,'' he said, adding
at another point, ``I see no reason at this moment why taxes have
to be raised.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., urged Brady to offer more than
``platitudes'' on the budget. Brady declined to recommend
specifics, but promised to present Congress with new ideas for
reducing the deficit by the end of the year.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the chairman of the Finance
Committee and the Democratic vice presidential candidate, gave
Brady a warm endorsement, even though Brady is a close adviser to
Bush.
   ``Nick Brady is a friend and former colleague and in my opinion
is a man who is well qualified to be treasury secretary,'' Bentsen
said. ``It's a big job, a tough job, but you're used to tough
jobs.''
   In his latest government assignment, Brady headed a presidential
task force that studied the causes of the October stock market
crash. His report called for greater regulation over some aspects
of the markets and was met with a cold shoulder by the
administration.
   Brady said market reforms put in place since the crash have been
``on the right track,'' declining to criticize the administration
for not doing everything his commission advised.
   ``I'm not sure we were 100 percent right. We did our work in 60
days,'' he said.
   On another matter, Brady said federal savings and loan
regulators have as much as they can spend for now on S&L rescues
and he said he saw no reason, for now, for a taxpayer bailout of
the industry.
   Brady's great-grandfather founded electric utilities that later
became part of Consolidated Edison Co., and his grandfather started
a precursor of Dodge Motor Co., now a division of Chrysler Corp.
The family also founded Purolator Co.
   Brady, 58, is co-chairman of Dillon Read & Co., an old-line Wall
Street investment firm, which he joined in 1954 after receiving a
master's degree in business from Harvard University.
   In 1982, he represented New Jersey for eight months in the
Senate by appointment, filling the seat of Democrat Harrison A.
Williams Jr., who had resigned following his conviction in the
Abscam influence-peddling scandal.

   A federal judge today approved the partial
merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers under a joint operating
arrangement granted earlier by then-Attorney General Edwin Meese
III.
   U.S. District Judge George Revercomb's decision approving the
partial merger of the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News came
a month after the deal was temporarily put on hold by court order
to give opponents a chance to mount a legal challenge.
   Revercomb said the stay issued last month blocking the merger
will be allowed to expire at 7:15 p.m. EDT Saturday.
   ``The court finds that the attorney general was not unreasonable
in finding that the Free Press _ a newspaper that has incurred and
will continue to incur losses that would already have led to its
demise were it not owned by a large corporate parent _ is a failing
newspaper,'' he said.
   William B. Schultz, who represented the plaintiffs, would not
comment on the decision and would not say whether he planned an
appeal until he has had an opportunity to read the opinion and
consult with his clients.
   Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, a group of readers
and advertisers in the Detroit area, had contended that the Free
Press, owned by Knight-Ridder, Inc., was not a failing newspaper
entitled to anti-trust exemptions under the 1980 Newspaper
Preservation Act.
   The group noted that Meese approved the joint operating
arrangement before he left office even though an administrative law
judge and the Justice Department's anti-trust division had
recommended against it.
   Opponents of the partial merger, represented by Ralph Nader's
Public Citizen Litigation Group, argued that the Free Press and the
News had each cut advertising and circulation rates to drive the
other out of business.
   The publishers' willingness to suffer losses for several years
was sustained by the knowledge that the two dailies might
eventually qualify for a joint operating agreement merging the two
publications' commercial operations, the opponents contended.
   But Revercomb concluded that Meese ``was not unreasonable in
concluding that the Free Press was primarily motivated by
competitive aims, not a JOA, in its recent business strategies.''
   The judge dismissed the plaintiff's argument that Meese's
findings were flawed because he accepted the factual findings but
not the conclusions of the administrative law judge. ``It is not
clear that the attorney general disagreed with the (law judge's)
fact findings as much much as his inferences derived from facts.''
   The administrative law judge's finding ``shows that the prospect
of a JOA played at most a secondary or supporting role in the
newspapers' motivations,'' Revercomb said.
   The Justice Department maintained in court last week there was
no evidence of collusion between the Free Press and the News,
purchased by the Gannett Co., Inc. in 1986, several months before
the two papers sought the joint operating agreement.
   Knight-Ridder, Inc., has threatened to close the morning Free
Press, which has lost $100 million over the last nine years, unless
the partial merger was allowed to go forward.
   At a hearing last week, Knight-Ridder's attorney, Clark
Clifford, said the Detroit area would lose 2,200 jobs if the Free
Press closed, compared to the 600 to 800 layoffs that would result
from the consolidation of the two newspapers' business, advertising
and circulation departments.
   Under the proposed joint operating agreement, the papers would
maintain separate editorial staffs to put out separate daily
editions. Combined editions would be published on weekends.
   Clifford said the Free Press was powerless to cut losses by
raising its prices unless the News first raised its circulation and
advertising rates.
   The News, which has also sustained significant losses, was
determined to drive the Free Press out of business if a joint
operating agreement was not approved, he said.
   According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, the Free Press had
a daily circulation last year of 638,720 daily compared to the
News' 678,720. On Sundays, the News held a slightly larger lead _
839,319 to 724,342.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Mostly Higher On Hurricane Fears, Export Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade on new export demand and
speculation that Hurricane Gilbert posed a threat to crops,
analysts said.
   Analysts said Gilbert's record-high winds and heavy rain were
not likely to cause serious damage to soybean crops in Louisiana
and Mississippi since few of those fields are near the Gulf Coast.
   But storms spawned by the hurricane could play havoc with corn
and soybean crops in the Midwest, where a summer drought has
weakened the stalks of many plants, analysts said.
   Corn also benefitted from Tuesday's news that the Soviet Union
had purchased 350,000 metric tons of U.S. corn from private
exporters, said Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst in New York
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Wheat futures were supported by reports that Morocco and Jordan
had bid for U.S. wheat, Spilka said.
   ``The wheat market is acting very well and adding exports adds
strength to it,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.12 a bushel; corn was {
cent lower to { cent higher with September at $2.85 a bushel; oats
were } cent to 3 cents higher with September at $2.68 a bushel;
soybeans were 5 cents lower to 5 cents higher with September at
$8.81 a bushel.

   The stock market climbed to five-week highs
today, responding to better-than-expected news on international
trade.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit shrank to $9.53 billion in July from a revised gap of
$13.22 billion the month before.
   Wall Street analysts had generally been looking for a July
figure in the $11 billion to $11.5 billion range.

   The stock market overcame some early hesitancy
to reach a five-week high Wednesday, responding to
better-than-expected news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 17.60 to
2,100.64, closing above 2,100 for the first time since it stood at
2,107.40 on Aug. 8.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
979 up, 502 down and 489 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177.22 million
shares, up from 162.49 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 205.70 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday morning that the
nation's trade deficit shrank to $9.53 billion in July from a
revised gap of $13.22 billion the month before.
   Wall Street analysts had generally been looking for a July
figure in the $11 billion to $11.5 billion range.
   Of particular note, brokers said, was a substantial drop in
imports. That was taken as a sign that the momentum of the domestic
economy was slowing in response to recent credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve.
   A moderation of economic growth would presumably allow the Fed
to pursue a less restrictive credit policy, encouraging steady to
lower interest rates.
   The dollar rose in foreign exchange following the trade report,
and interest rates fell in the credit markets.
   But some stock traders still shied away from bidding up stocks
aggressively, suggesting that the market was still not entirely
over its late-summer malaise.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose { to 97;
General Motors added | to 75\, and American Telephone & Telegraph

   TW Services climbed 1| to 22\ in continued speculation about

Hurricane Gilbert.

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

0.58 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .98 to 152.13.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 2.44 to 309.39, and

   Money traders scrambled to buy dollars Wednesday
after the government announced the sharpest trade-deficit drop in
nearly six years, driving up the currency's value despite Federal
Reserve intervention.
   Gold prices declined marginally in late U.S. trading after
rising abroad. Republic National Bank in New York quoted bullion at
$429.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 10 cents from the same
time Tuesday.
   Currency-market analysts said the Commerce Department's report
that the July trade deficit narrowed to $9.5 billion in July, about
$3 billion below expectations, incited a wild dollar buying spree
that overwhelmed central-bank attempts to moderate the rise through
small bursts of dollar selling.
   ``They just plummeted the foreign currencies against the
dollar,'' said Kenneth Jakubzak, fund director for managed accounts
at First Commercial Financial Group Inc, a Chicago-based currency
futures trading concern. ``There was some Fed selling of dollars,
but traders just ignored it.''
   The 28 percent June-to-July deficit decrease was the biggest
improvement since a 35.7 percent narrowing in September 1982. It
gave the country the lowest monthly imbalance since December 1984,
when the deficit was $8 billion.
   Traders interpreted the Commerce Department report as a strong
signal that America's appetite for imports is waning, thereby
reducing inflation prospects and strengthening the relative worth
of the dollar vs. other currencies.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.38 Japanese yen to close at 133.45
yen. Later in London it gained further to 134.55 yen. By the time
trading closed in New York the dollar fetched 134.27 yen, vs.
133.37 yen late Tuesday.
   The dollar soared against the British pound in London, where
sterling fetched $1.6750, vs. $1.6965 late Tuesday. Later in New
York sterling was quoted at $1.6793, cheaper than its $1.6941 level
late Tuesday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Tuesday: 1.8770 West German marks, up from 1.8534; 1.5817 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5608; 1.2241 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2283;
6.3875 French francs, up from 6.2950; and 1,398.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,383.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday:
1.8783 West German marks, up from 1.8470; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5600; 6.3915 French francs, up from 6.2935; 2.1155 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0845; 1,399.50 Italian lire, up from 1,380.50;
and 1.2223 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2307.
   Gold rose in London to $421.75 a troy ounce, compared with
$420.00 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $421.50 from $421.00,
and in Hong Kong it rose 76 cents to $423.45.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell 20 cents to $421.30.
   Silver rose on the London market to $6.53 a troy ounce vs. $6.46
Tuesday. On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery fetched
$6.489, up 1.2 cents.

<HEAD>Alcoa Announces Profit-Sharing Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aluminum Co. of America said Wednesday that
7,000 salaried employees in its domestic aluminum operations will
participate in a profit-sharing plan beginning this year.
   Officials said the plan would create a profit-sharing pool when
the company's U.S. operations exceed a return of 6 percent on
assets. They said employees would share 17 percent of profits above
this threshold.
   Alcoa officials said individual payouts will vary with profits
and the number of employees involved. The plan is retroactive to
Jan. 1, the company said.
   Alcoa said the payout could amount to about 7 percent of each
employee's base salary if second-half 1988 profits equal first-half
profits.
   In contract negotiations three weeks ago, the company offered a
profit-sharing plan to union employees that would amount to up to
$1,300 for blue-collar workers, based on Alcoa's expected 1988
profits.
   The United Steelworkers of America union said it rejected the
plan as inadequate and said it opposed the company's plan to extend
it to salaried, white-collar workers.
   On Aug. 24, the USW and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers
unions broke off early negotiations with Alcoa after rejecting
offers that included profit-sharing, an immediate ratification
bonus, annual lump sum bonuses, an improved medical insurance
option and increased pension benefits.
   USW negotiator George Becker said the talks ended because Alcoa
``would not address several key issues,'' including wage and
pension increases.
   The unions sought new contracts to recover concessions
negotiated in 1986, when the aluminum industry faced difficult
economic times.

<HEAD>Latin Americans Pledge New Initiatives on Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin American and Caribbean nations
Wednesday pledged to take the initiative in solving their debt
crisis as they began an annual round of talks on regional economic
problems.
   Carlos Perez de Castillo, secretary-general of the 26-member
Latin American Economic System (SELA), called for a new approach on
the region's $410 billion debt which ``does not mean decreeing a
moratorium or creating a debtors' club.''
   He said it could mean reaching agreement on a common negotiating
framework which would include linking debt payments to export
income, limiting interest rates and paying according to the market
value of the debts.
   ``SELA must take a serious initiative regarding the foreign
debt,'' Perez del Castillo told delegates at the opening of the
technical meeting of SELA's 14th Annual Council. The three-day
ministerial level meeting begins Sept. 19.
   ``We are convinced that the solutions to the region's problems
will not come from abroad. Latin America must make a united effort
to generate its own initiatives,'' he said.
   He also recommended that Latin America use its annual $65
billion in imports from industrialized nations as a negotiating
tool to ``equalize'' trade in the face of growing protectionism.
   ``Everything the region exports is negotiated, but what we
import is not negotiated. This form of commercial relations must
change,'' he said.
   Perez's call for greater regional action comes as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which begin their
annual assembly Sept. 27 in West Berlin, admit that their
market-oriented approach to solving the Latin American debt problem
has not had the desired results.
   The IMF lends to debtors which agree to adopt austerity policies
to promote economic stability. But Latin American debtors claim
that the policies limit their ability to grow out of their debts.
   In its 1987 annual report, the IMF notes that the debt burden
was a key factor in causing Latin American economies to shrink by
1.5 percent overall last year.
   ``There remains much to be done to relieve the weight of the
debt and restore world growth,'' IMF Director Michel Camdessus said
in the report's introduction.

<HEAD>US Advertising Firm Agrees on Joint Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. advertising company Young & Rubicam Inc.
and a Soviet government agency said Wednesday they had agreed on a
joint project to help Soviet and Western companies reach each
other's markets.
   The joint venture is expected to begin work here next January
with a staff of six, including two Americans.
   The announcement came in Soviet media reports in Moscow and in
an announcement released in New York where Young & Rubicam is based.
   ``Dozens of new Soviet exporters which entered the world market
clearly lack experience in promoting their goods, knowledge of the
commercial situation,'' Yuri Deomidov, head of the Soviet
organization Vneshtorgreklama, said in remarks reported by the Tass
news agency.
   ``The joint venture with Young & Rubicam ... will help them to
explore the market and will provide top-class advertising
services,'' he said.
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said the Soviet
organization also will provide similar services to Western firms
trying to crack the Soviet market.
   ``If earlier it was enough for them to have several reliable
contacts in the Foreign Trade Ministry to strike a deal, now they
have to choose among hundreds of Soviet enterprises and foreign
trade firms,'' Deomidov said.
   Young & Rubicam said the new venture will be owned and managed
jointly with a board of directors having equal representation from
each partner.
   The Soviet organization will own 51 percent of the venture while
Young & Rubicam will own 49 percent, the statement said.
   Alex Kroll, chairman and chief executive of Young & Rubicam,
said a number of the agency's clients ``are already deeply involved
in developing joint enterprises with their Soviet industrial
counterparts.''
   ``We are delighted that we will be able to maintain our
tradition of prroviding service wherever our clients choose to do
business,'' he said.
   The privately-held Young & Rubicam is one of the world's largest
advertising companies with billings of $4.9 billion in 1987,
according to the trade journal Advertising Age.

<HEAD>Largest Shareholder Seeks Control, Sale Of Zenith</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp.'s largest shareholder,
frustrated by the company's steep losses in recent years, announced
plans Wednesday to seize control of the company and sell it.
   Brookhurst Partners, a New York investor group with a 6.1
percent stake in Zenith, said it planned to wage a proxy fight to
reduce the size of Zenith's board of directors from 10 seats to six
and to replace three of the six directors with its own nominees.
   ``Our decision is based on the firm conviction that direction is
needed to ensure the board's compliance with the collective will of
the company's shareholders,'' the dissident group said in a letter
to Zenith's board.
   Spokesman John Taylor said Zenith officials had not seen a copy
of the lawsuit, ``so it is inappropriate to comment.''
   Zenith, the last remaining U.S. television manufacturer, has
been fighting a losing battle against low-priced imported
televisions.
   Despite the success of its highly regarded computers, Zenith
suffered multimillion-dollar losses for the past three years,
including a loss of $19.1 million last year on sales of $2.36
billion.
   The company's stock gained 12{ cents Wednesday in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $21.75.
   Peter Harkins, general counsel for Brookhurst Partners, said in
a telephone interview that the group would seek written consents
from shareholders to undertake its plan.
   He said Brookhurst had filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Delaware challenging a provision in Zenith's articles of
incorporation that requires the unanimous consent of all
stockholders for an action initiated by written consent to be
effective.
   Brookhurst claims the provision violates Delaware laws
guaranteeing the right of stockholders to take action by written
consent, he said. Zenith is incorporated in Delaware.
   Zenith posted a profit of $400,000, or 1 cent a share, on sales
of $574.1 million in the first quarter of 1988, but had a second
quarter loss of $12.1 million.
   Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman has said repeatedly since
April that the board was exploring ``all options'' for returning
the company to profitability, including selling its
television-making consumer electronics unit.
   But Brookhurst, formed by Herbert B. Abelow and Nicholas L.
Ihasz specifically to acquire Zenith stock, said it no longer could
tolerate the board's apparent inaction or its strategy of cutting
costs while waiting for television prices to stablilize.
   ``In our view, this can lead only to increased debt, lower
earnings, inadequate cash flow and more serious financial
difficulties,'' the partnership said in its letter.
   ``Other major shareowners have expressed to us their agreement
with our views and frustration with the board of directors'
continuing failure to enhance share value.''
   Abelow, Ihasz and Paul Street would be the three Brookhurst
nominees to Zenith's board, Harkins said.
   The partnership proposes to retain directors John H. Johnson,
Wilbur H. Gantz and Frederick G. Jaicks, none of whom work for
Zenith, and to dump Pearlman, Harry B. Beckner, Sidney Davidson, G.
Ralph Gurthrie, Robert B. Hansen, John W. Madigan and Arthur W.
Schultz, Harkins said.

<HEAD>Preston Robert Tisch Joins Brother on CBS Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businessman Preston Robert Tisch has been
elected to the board of CBS Inc., where he joins his brother, CBS
chief executive Laurence A. Tisch, the communications giant
announced Wednesday.
   Preston Tisch, better known as Bob, stepped down in March after
serving 19 months as U.S. Postmaster General. It had been
speculated widely that he eventually would join the CBS board.
   The Tisch brothers already have considerable economic ties.
   They serve as co-chief executives of Loews Corp., a tobacco,
real estate, insurance and hotel conglomerate that is CBS's biggest
shareholder. In addition, Preston is president and Laurence is
chairman of Loews.
   Preston's election to the CBS board at a regular board meeting
was announced by William S. Paley, the CBS founder and chairman.
   In a statement, Paley was quoted as saying the new board member
has ``broad experience in business and public affairs and he should
be a most valuable addition to the company.''
   His election boosts membership on the board to 14 from 13.
   The CBS board has operated with 13 members since September 1986
when Thomas P. Wyman was ousted as chairman and chief executive
following a dramatic boardroom battle.
   At that time, the board made Laurence Tisch acting chief
executive and Paley became acting chairman. Four months later, the
board deleted the word ``acting'' from their job titles.
   Under Tisch, CBS has trimmed costs, sold its magazine and
records divisions and seen its television network fall to third
place last season for the first time in the prime time ratings.
   Tisch has installed new executives at the head of the CBS
broadcasting and news operations and has vowed to put the network
back on top in the ratings.

<HEAD>Struggling Movie Company Gets $80 Million Loan from GECC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Capital Corp. will get 15
percent of the stock in struggling New World Entertainment Corp. in
return for an $80 million loan aimed at helping the movie and
television company service its heavy long-term debt, the companies
announced Wednesday.
   The loan, which New World intends to repay with proceeds from
the planned sale of its Marvel Entertainment Group, allowed the
company to redeem $141.5 million in long-term debt. The new $80
million loan brings to $115 million the credit from Stamford,
Conn.-based GE Capital to New World.
   ``The debt restructuring is a cornerstone of the turnaround for
New World,'' said Harry Evans Sloan, co-chairman.
   The latest debt transaction, combined with two similar moves
earlier this year, reduced New World's long-term debt from $285
million to $55 million. Interest costs, which had been crippling
New World, will be cut from more than $33 million a year to about
$6 million a year, Sloan said.
   Marvel, which makes comic books such as ``Spiderman'' and ``The
Incredible Hulk'' and cartoons, has attracted numerous bidders, but
a sale agreement has not been reached, Sloan said.
   New World lost $7.9 million in the first quarter of this year,
but is banking on the debt swap and potential earnings from new TV
shows and movies, including ``Crime Story'' and ``The Wonder
Years,'' a new show which won an Emmy Award.
   The company's most recent movies, ``18 Again,'' ``Dead Heat''
and ``Wrong Guys,'' did not do well at the box office.
