   A Guyanese immigrant convicted of killing his
girlfriend and four members of her family in a jealous rage lost
appeals Tuesday in state and federal courts in his last-minute bid
to avoid the electric chair.
   The Louisiana Supreme Court and then U.S. District Judge Peter
Beer refused to put off the execution of Leslie Lowenfield, 34,
which is set for early Wednesday.
   Lowenfield's attorneys then went to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals with the plea that he is mentally ill and therefore
unable to understand the death penalty.
   At the Louisiana State Penitentiary, Warden Hilton Butler said
Lowenfield was still hoping for a fifth delay of as many execution
dates.
   Butler said Lowenfield spurned the condemned's customary last
meal and spent the evening with Dale Brown, the head basketball
coach from Louisiana State University.
   Brown, widely recognized as a motivational speaker, had been
corresponding with Lowenfield since he took the LSU team on a tour
of Angola's death row in 1984, Butler said.
   A Catholic priest and nun also were with Lowenfield, the warden
said.
   Lowenfield, a welder from Guyana who came to the United States
in 1981 on a work permit, was convicted in 1984 in the August 1982
slayings of his estranged girlfriend, who was a Jefferson Parish
sheriff's deputy, and four others.
   The case has already been appealed unsuccessfully to both the
state's highest court and the U.S. Supreme Court. Lawyers based
their latest appeal on a recent psychological study that found the
prisoner to be a paranoid schizophrenic.
   ``There is a serious question about Leslie's competency to be
executed due to his mental illness,'' said Judith Menadue, attorney
for the Louisiana Capital Defense Project.
   She said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that people who cannot
understand what it means to be executed may not be put to death.
   Before the trial, Lowenfield was found competent, and he refused
to allow his lawyers to use insanity as a defense, insisting
instead that he was in Florida at the time the family was killed.
But no witnesses backed up his story of being out of state.
   The denial of the stay was issued without further comment from
the state Supreme Court majority, but the one member who backed the
appeal issued a brief dissent.
   ``The clinical psychologist who spent five hours with the
defendant concluded: `Lowenfield indicated that he is currently
unable to understand the death penalty,''' Justice John A. Dixon
wrote.
   He noted that criminal law calls for halting prosecution when
there are reasonable grounds to doubt a defendant's sanity, and for
going ahead after that only when the defendant is found to have the
mental capacity to do so.
   Prosecutors said Lowenfield barged into his girlfriend's house
in Marrero, a New Orleans suburb, and shot everybody there.
   The victims were the girlfriend, Sheila Thomas, 27; her
daughter, Shantel Osborne, 4; her stepfather, Owen Griffin, 45; her
mother, Myrtle Griffin, 44; and the little girl's father, Carl
Osborne, 33.
   The prosecution said Lowenfield was jealous of Miss Thomas. They
said the couple had lived together in a stormy relationship until
earlier in the summer of 1982 when he set the house on fire and she
moved out.
   Investigators found a notebook full of obscenities and threats.
In one place he wrote, ``She have to go to the wormes she took all
I work for then leave to go and be with Carl but I just cannot take
it eany more.''
   Lowenfield was arrested two months later in New York.
   Parts of the evidence against him were letters he wrote Miss
Thomas' relatives while he was jailed in New York. One said Osborne
had grabbed the child as a shield and Lowenfield had shot both of
them.
   On trial, Lowenfield insisted on an alibi defense, saying he was
in Jacksonville, Fla., looking for work at the time of the murders.
   After a separate trial to determine the penalty, jurors came
back three times saying they could not decide whether he should
die. Prodded on by the judge, they decided on the fourth try to
condemn him to death.

Victim</HEAD>

   A man convicted of raping and maiming
a teenager almost 10 years ago is seeking a criminal investigation
into his allegation that the woman actually kidnapped him, a
newspaper reported Monday.
   Lawrence Singleton, who is scheduled to be freed April 25 after
serving seven years and nine months in prison and a year on parole,
said he filed a complaint in Superior Court in Placer and Marin
counties requesting the woman's arrest, the Daily Ledger of Antioch
reported.
   Singleton, 60, was convicted in 1979 of raping Mary Vincent,
then 15, and hacking off her forearms with an ax on Sept. 29, 1978.
He was sentenced to 14 years and 4 months in prison, which was
reduced for good behavior and work credit.
   Singleton said he will move to Oregon to spend his ``first few
days'' of freedom with a church group after his release, the
newspaper said, but he did not rule out a return to California.
   Singleton has spent the last 10 months of his parole in a
trailer on the grounds of San Quentin state prison for his own
protection after residents of several northern California
communities protested against his planned parole last year.
   Vincent, who expressed anxiety about his parole at that time,
has moved to the Pacific Northwest and recently told The Associated
Press through an intermediary that she did not want to be
interviewed further about Singleton.
   The Ledger said it obtained a copy of a 12-page, typewritten
complaint in which Singleton alleges Vincent committed kidnap for
the purpose of robbery and use of two deadly weapons.
   According to the Ledger, the complaint said Singleton was
heading to Sparks, Nev., when he picked up Vincent hitchhiking in
Berkeley, Calif., and agreed to take her to Reno.
   The complaint said Vincent began smoking PCP, a hallucinogen,
then said she wanted to go to Los Angeles, became abusive and poked
Singleton with a three-foot surveyor stick, the newspaper reported.
   ``(She) told me that if I did not comply with her wishes she
would poke out my eyes, smash my face, and hurt, hurt, hurt me and
say that I raped her,'' the newspaper quoted the complaint as
saying.
   The complaint also alleges Vincent threatened Singleton with a
six-inch fish-scaling knife, the newspaper reported.
   Singleton claims he drove Vincent to Galt, 20 miles south of
Sacramento, where he picked up two male hitchhikers who joined
Vincent in extorting money from Singleton to buy drugs, the
newspaper reported.
   The complaint says Singleton drove north and left Vincent in a
``low-rent district'' in Sacramento and never saw her again, the
newspaper reported.
   Although not in the complaint, Singleton has repeatedly claimed
he allowed one of the hitchhikers to drive while he was drinking,
passed out, then awoke to find Vincent was gone but her clothes
were still in the van.
   The hitchhikers, he has contended, committed the crimes.
Authorities, however, have maintained the two hitchhikers never
existed.
   Singleton said in a telephone interview he mailed the complaint
Saturday to authorities in the two counties, but court clerks in
both counties said Monday morning they had not received the
complaints, the Ledger reported.

<HEAD>Brazilian Drought, European Demand Raise Soybean Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean market prices are averaging the most
in three years because of greater world demand and a tightening of
available supplies, an Agriculture Department analysis shows.
   Drought has damaged Brazil's soybean crop, and the European
Economic Community has increased its demand for the oilseed, the
department's Economic Research Service said Monday. That has helped
whittle down U.S. soybean stockpiles and boost prices.
   The supply-and-demand report said soybean prices now could
average in the range of $5.50 to $5.80 per bushel in the marketing
year that began last Sept. 1, up from $5.35 to $5.75 forecast in
March. Prices averaged $4.78 per bushel in the 1986-87 season.
   According to USDA records, that would be the most since soybeans
averaged $5.84 per bushel in 1984-85. They were $7.83 in the
1983-84 marketing year.
   Soybean exports were forecast at 785 million bushels, up from
760 million indicated last month and the 757 million bushels
shipped in 1986-87.
   Wheat exports also have improved, due mainly to subsidized sales
to the Soviet Union under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   In all, exports in the wheat marketing year that runs through
May 31 are estimated at 1.6 billion bushels, a 60 percent increase
from 1 billion bushels shipped in 1986-87. Average market prices
for this season were put at $2.55 per bushel, up from $2.42 last
year.
   Corn exports also are up, rising to an estimated 1.7 billion
bushels in the corn marketing year that began last Sept. 1,
compared with 1.5 billion bushels in 1986-87.
   Market prices of corn were forecast to average $1.65 to $1.85
per bushel this season, up from $1.50 in 1986-87.

   Agriculture Department scientists are looking
at the neem tree of Asia and Africa as a possible source of
material to prevent the formation of aflatoxin, a food toxin that
occurs in nature.
   Aflatoxin can be produced by fungi that forms on some farm crops
under certain conditions, including corn and oilseeds. Laboratory
tests with animals have shown that aflatoxin is among the most
powerful cancer-causing agents known, and USDA has called it a
``potential'' hazard to humans.
   Deepak Bhatnagar said in a report released here that as a child
in India his parents used to put leaves of the neem tree inside
containers of wheat to keep insects from the grain. Now, as a USDA
scientist, he has found that the leaves may also block fungi from
producing aflatoxin.
   In tests at the department's Agricultural Research Service
center in New Orleans, La., Bhatnagar made solutions containing
neem leaves. He found that the solutions didn't kill the fungi but
did block more than 98 percent of the aflatoxin they normally would
have produced.
   The fungi that produce the toxin are Aspergillus flavus and A.
parasiticus.
   Bhatnagar said the results were ``promising, but preliminary''
and that greenhouse studies with cotton are now being planned.
   The ornamental neem is also known as margosa and nim. More than
80 insect pests, including Mexican bean beetles, Colorado potato
beetles, tobacco budworms and carpet beetles are repelled by neem
extracts.

   Spice imports totaled about $439 million last
year, up 12 percent from 1986, says the Agriculture Department.
   The rise was due mainly to larger imports of vanilla beans,
white pepper, nutmeg and mace, cassia, cumin, anise, capsicum
peppers, laurel and thyme, the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service reported Monday. Higher prices of many of the items also
were a factor.
   ``Saffron prices have soared in recent months, reflecting a
short Spanish crop,'' the report said.
   Also, it added, cesium contamination from the Soviet Union's
nuclear mishap at Chernobyl two years ago ``has kept supplies tight
and prices firm for several Mediterranean-area herbs such as
oregano, laurel, rosemary and sage.''

<HEAD>Young People Are Feeling The Tax Bite, Too, As Friday Approaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of young Americans are filling out
federal tax returns for the first time as Friday's filing deadline
approaches, and many of them are learning that you don't always get
a refund.
   Several new provisions affecting students who work part-time and
youngsters under the age of 14 took effect in 1987 and are being
felt on returns filed this year. The net effect is to complicate
the finances of these people and, in many cases, of their parents.
   The Internal Revenue Service estimates 3.3 million people are
having to file returns for the first time because a section of the
1986 law denies a personal exemption, worth $1,900 for 1987, to
those who can be claimed as a dependent by a parent or someone else.
   In addition, young people can lose a good portion of their
$2,540 standard deduction by being claimed by a parent. And
thresholds for filing are lower than in the past.
   Two other new provisions:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Any child 5 or older who is claimed as a dependent must have a
Social Security number, which must be listed on the parents'
return. The IRS has waived the penalty for not listing the number
on 1987 returns, but it's still required.
   _Any investment income exceeding $1,000 received by a child
under 14 is now taxed at the parents' higher rate, assuming that is
higher than the child's rate. These calculations must be made on
Form 8615, which must be attached to the child's return.
   Congress imposed this requirement to block mainly higher-income
parents from avoiding taxes by shifting income-producing property
to a child. Under the old law, a parent could have avoided $390 of
tax on $1,000 worth of interest that was credited to the child's
account, paying $110 instead of $500.
   This ``kiddie tax'' provision has been a source of anguish for
taxpayers, experts say. ``There is more confusion in trying to fill
out the forms than there is surprise about so many minors having to
file for the first time,'' says Vern Martens, senior tax attorney
at Merrill Lynch headquarters in New York.
   Three other new forms are causing questions, too, although
relatively few of the 107 million couples and individuals who are
expected to file returns this year will have to face them. They are:
   _8598, which fewer than 1 million people will have to file to
calculate how much of their home mortgage interest is deductible.
It generally applies only to those whose outstanding mortgage and
home equity loans total more than the purchase price of the home
and any improvements.
   _8606, required mainly of middle- and upper-income taxpayers who
make non-deductible contributions to an IRA.
   _8582, for calculating losses on rental operations and other
``passive-activity'' investments.
   If you don't feel ready to tackle any of these forms _ or the
basic 1040 or 1040A _ you might consider filing Form 4868. Filing
this form, and your check for what you estimate you owe, by
midnight Friday will give you an extra four months to file your
return.
   If you underestimate your taxes, you will be liable for interest
and penalty on the shortage. But the four-month reprieve might keep
you from rushing into a mistake.
   The IRS expects about 6\ million couples and individuals to ask
for the automatic delay, about 1 million more than last year. IRS
spokesman Wilson Fadely cautions: ``If you wait until the last day
to look at the library or Post Office for the form, you may not
find one.''
   The IRS expects 37 million returns during the three weeks ending
April 22. More than 58 million had been received by April 1. Some
of the remainder will be filed after the deadline; some will come
later from military personnel stationed abroad; and some taxpayers
have different deadlines.
   The IRS has processed 81 percent of the returns received so far,
down slightly from last year. More than 77 percent are getting
refunds, compared with 78 percent at this time last year. Refunds
are averaging $825, up from $806.
   Although tax rates were cut, many people are paying more tax
because all or parts of several deductions were lost. These include
sales taxes, consumer interest, medical expenses, such
miscellaneous itemized writeoffs as union dues, the special
deduction for two-earner couples, and _ in many cases _ some or all
the deduction for Individual Retirement Account contributions.

   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III seems to
be making progress in his drive to get the world's top economic
powers to use the price of gold and other commodities to help them
coordinate economic policies.
   Baker took economic leaders by surprise when he advanced the
idea last September, with some countries openly skeptical.
   But Baker has demonstrated considerable skill as one of the
administration's top negotiators and officials indicated Monday
that the world's seven top industrial countries are likely to give
formal approval to Baker's commodity-index proposal on Wednesday.
   The seven nations, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada, will hold high-level talks in
Washington as part of the spring meeting of the 151-nation
International Monetary Fund.
   A senior Treasury Department official, briefing reporters
Monday, said the administration is ``hopeful there will be some
agreement'' by the seven countries to adopt the commodity-basket
proposal. The official spoke on condition his name not be used.
   Baker has stressed that he is not proposing a return to the gold
standard, the system in use for 25 years after World War II. For
most of that time, the price of gold was fixed at $35 an ounce and
the currencies of other countries were pegged at fixed exchange
rates to the dollar.
   That system broke down in the early 1970s under the weight of
higher inflation and a rising flow of international capital between
countries. It was replaced with today's floating exchange rate
system under which the value of each nation's currency is set on
the open market.
   But the extreme volatility in floating rates, especially for the
U.S. dollar, has driven the big industrial countries in search of
ways to stabilize exchange rates.
   One method that Baker has pushed since the Tokyo economic summit
in 1986 has been the use of a variety of economic indicators to
monitor each country's performance in helping to sustain worldwide
growth. This group of indicators includes individual growth rates,
inflation and trade balances.
   Baker's proposal would add gold and other commodity prices to
the list of economic yardsticks the countries use to coordinate
policies.
   This approach would introduce a price-sensitive measure into the
economic planning process. In addition to gold, other commodities
which might be included are iron ore, copper, rubber, cotton,
wheat, rice, corn, coffee and tea.
   If the price of these commodities rose in particular countries,
those nations would be encouraged to boost interest rates to fight
inflation. But if commodity prices were falling, the countries
would know they had room to cut interest rates and stimulate
economic growth without danger of inflation.
   Some countries, in particular West Germany, have opposed the
commodity index because they see it as a device that would be used
to goad them into achieving faster growth at the risk of sparking
inflation.
   But in a television interview Monday, Baker said the seven top
industrial countries were in basic agreement at present over the
steps needed to stabilize exchange rates.
   ``The major industrialized countries of the world obviously
favor stability of exchange rates and we have been very pleased
with the stability we have seen since our last meeting in
December,'' Baker said on NBC's ``Today'' program.
   Last Dec. 22, the seven countries pledged to support the dollar,
which at the time was under heavy selling pressure. That commitment
was backed up by massive intervention, the process by which
governments buy weak currencies such as the dollar to drive up the
price.

<HEAD>After 10 Years of Reform, Teachers Still Not Full-Fledged
Professionals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade of school reform has produced stacks of
legislation, higher teacher pay and tighter teaching requirements
but has left unresolved whether teachers are full-fledged
professionals, a report says.
   ``By sheer volume of legislation, it is clear that teaching has
been `reformed,''' said the 80-page Rand Corp. report, ``The
Evolution of Teacher Policy,'' released Monday.
   ``Teaching policy is up for grabs _ and there are lots of people
grabbing,'' it said.
   The net result of hundreds of education-related bills enacted
during the past decade has been contradiction and confusion,
concluded the report by researchers Linda Darling-Hammond and
Barnett Barry.
   School reform has yet to settle whether teachers are
professionals possessing a body of knowledge and capable of dealing
with the individual needs of students, or whether they are merely
``semiskilled workers'' needing constant supervision, the
researchers said.
   Still, the report found that average salaries rose 31 percent
from 1981 to 1986 to $25,240, and 19 states adopted minimum salary
schedules. More recent figures from the National Education
Association estimate average salaries at $28,000 this year.
   Starting salaries are also up, but not enough to close the gap
between teaching and other professions. According to NEA figures,
the average was $17,500 in 1987, while beginning accountants,
chemists, computer specialists and engineers, for example, all
earned in excess of $20,000.
   Overall, the average teacher's purchasing power is practically
unchanged from 1971-72 levels, according to the analysis.
   Nearly all states considered performance-based pay systems,
including merit pay, from 1983 to 1986. But such programs often
have encountered delays because of teacher opposition and lack of
funds.
   Twenty-seven states enacted tougher teacher training
requirements, including testing of academic ability and minimum
grade-point averages. States are increasingly stressing liberal
arts background over education courses.
   ``Paradoxically, for a number of states, improving teacher
preparation seems to mean reducing the amount of time devoted to
traditional teacher education,'' the report said.
   By 1986, 46 states required teacher competency testing for
admission to teacher education or certification or both. But such
testing has stalled in many states because of lack of funding or
questions about the tests's validity.
   In a contradiction, 46 states have cleared the way for
substandard, limited emergency certification. Twenty-seven of those
states issue certificates to people lacking even a bachelor's
degree to solve teacher shortages.
   ``This practice undermines the tenet ... that only those who
have mastered a specialized knowledge base will be admitted to
practice,'' the report said.
   National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell
called the Rand report ``right on target.''
   Bruce Goldberg, assistant director of educational issues for the
American Federation of Teachers, called the report ``obviously
correct. If teaching is to become a true profession, then teachers
will have to be granted the kind of autonomy required of any other
profession.''
   The Rand study is being published nearly five years after the
Reagan administration issued the report ``A Nation at Risk,'' which
blasted mediocrity in U.S. schools.
   While initial reform efforts aimed at boosting salaries and
toughening teacher certification requirements, a more recent wave
of reforms has stressed freeing teachers from unnecessary
regulations and boosting their status.
   In effect, reformers in the last two years have come to believe
that there should be higher standards to enter teaching, but fewer
rules about what and how to teach.
   ``This is, in essence, the bargain that all professions make
with society,'' the report said.
   ``The next generation of teacher policy reform will need to
focus on the content and nature of effective teaching, its
assessment, and its deployment within schools to ensure that the
long-range goals of the reformers are met,'' the report concluded.

representatives in Congress to consider changes in the Social
Security system, but no single option for cutting costs has broad
public support, according to a survey.
   The public also strongly favors pulling U.S. troops out of
Europe as a way to reduce the federal budget deficit, according to
the survey by the League of Concerned Americans, a Charlotte,
N.C.-based non-profit group.
   The league commissioned the nationwide poll as part of a project
called ``America's Budget,'' an effort to determine national
spending priorities from a non-Washington perspective. It planned
to release a suggested budget today.
   ``A lot of things that are perceptually true in Washington ...
are not that way across the country,'' said Scott Rasmussen,
founder of the league.
   For example, an informal congressional survey showed 80 percent
of the members favored leaving the Social Security system
untouched. Only 34 percent favored that option in the nationwide
poll.
   However, people differed over what changes should be made, the
poll showed.
   From a list of options, 21 percent favored making the system
voluntary and 25 percent supported raising the retirement age to
allow a drop in the Social Security tax. Only 6 percent favored
cutting cost-of-living adjustments for retirees _ the most
frequently mentioned option when Washington considers cutbacks.
   Congress has been holding hearings this year on what lawmakers
call ``burden sharing'' _ forcing U.S. allies to take on more of
the cost of defending against the Soviet bloc.
   The informal survey of Congress showed only 12 percent said they
would favor gradually withdrawing ``a substantial portion'' of U.S.
troops from Western Europe over the next 20 years. However, more
than three out of four citizens polled supported the idea.
   The poll was conducted for the league by Marketwise, Inc. The
random sample of 519 respondents has a margin of error of 4.3
percentage points.
   Despite the 1983 changes in the Social Security, which included
raising taxes to build up big surpluses over the next few years,
more than a fourth of the people polled still doubt whether their
benefits will be there when they retire, according to the survey.
   ``I think there is a real temptation (to spend the money) if
there are surpluses,'' said Rasmussen.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said Monday he would propose a resolution to put
Congress on record opposing the current accounting system which
allows Social Security surpluses to hide the true size of the
government's operating deficit.
   Rasmussen, a business entrepreneur who with his father founded
the ESPN sports network in 1978, said he hoped the league would
help prod the politicians to keep working toward a balanced budget.
The results were being presented to the new national commission on
the deficit, which will make recommendations for the next president
and Congress on ways to cut red ink, he said.

   A jumbo jet bound for Germany from Los
Angeles made a successful emergency landing here Monday after the
plastic layers in one of the cockpit side windows began to come
apart, an airport spokesman said.
   Pan Am Flight 150, with 322 passengers on board, left Los
Angeles for Frankfurt about 3 p.m., turned back about an hour and a
half later, and made a safe emergency landing at San Francisco
International Airport about 5:30, said spokesman Ron Wilson.
   The pilot of the Boeing 747 turned back after he heard a loud
snap and saw a window on his left begin to ``delaminate,'' Wilson
said.
   ``Obviously the aircraft could not fly at any altitude or great
speed with that,'' Wilson said. ``I don't think there was ever any
danger. The pilot did what he was supposed to do.''
   The pilot had to reduce the plane's altitude and depressurize
the cabin somewhat on the way back, Wilson said.
   He said the window would be repaired at the airport.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Politics? Here's What it Really Means ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new book offers some timely definitions in
this season of taxes and politics, including the observation that a
``front-runner'' these days is someone who claims to be the
underdog for fear of going the way of his predecessors.
   Or, for example, that the art of taxation has been defined as
``so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers
with the least amount of hissing.''
   Front-runner is ``what all candidates want to be, but don't want
to be called,'' says the recently published ``Dorsey Dictionary of
American Politics,'' a product of Chicago's Dorsey Press.
   With 4,000 entries, the book compiled and written by Jay M.
Shafritz of the University of Pittsburgh graduate school aims to
capture in dictionary form the nuts and bolts of American
constitutional government, including the slang and stories of its
199 years of existence. It provides descriptions of government
agencies, court decisions, people, places, things and states of
mind.
   A box charts the rise of the federal budget deficit from $2.8
billion under President Nixon in 1970 to $220.7 billion under
President Reagan in 1986.
   One entry recalls Thomas Jefferson asking George Washington why
the constitutional convention _ over which Washington had presided
_ had created a Senate as well as a House.
   ``Why do you pour your coffee into your saucer?'' Washington is
supposed to have asked Jefferson.
   ``To cool it,'' Jefferson replied.
   ``Even so,'' concluded Washington. ``We pour legislation into
the senatorial saucer to cool it.''
   Flipping through the pages, one finds that one possible origin
of the word Yankee to designate Americans in general or New
Englanders in particular is from ``a corruption of Jan Kees, an
unkind Dutch nickname meaning John Cheese.''
   ``The Dutch, who first settled New York, applied the name to the
English who followed,'' the dictionary says.
   Then there is ``stand pat.''
   It is described as a phrase originating in the game of poker
that has been extended to mean one who accepts a present situation
or stands by an existing policy.
   ``Nobody in American politics today is in favor of standing
pat,'' the dictionary maintains and adds:
   ``There is a classic piece of film from the 1960 presidential
campaign in which Richard Nixon, with his wife, Pat, seated behind
him, energetically tells an audience that _ `We can't stand pat.'''
   ``Subsequently, to Mrs. Nixon's presumed relief, he changed that
line to `America cannot stand still.'''
   As his term nears an end, Reagan is at times referred to as a
``lame duck.''
   The dictionary says the phrase originated in the early days of
the London Stock Exchange which then operated out of Exchange Alley.
   The dictionary: ``A broker who went bankrupt would `waddle out
of the alley' like a lame duck.''
   The expression has long since crossed the Atlantic and expanded
its meaning to any soon-to-be-out-of-office leader whose authority
is consequently impaired.
   Most of the dictionary's topics involve serious subjects.
Deregulation, deterrence, devaluation and dictators, for example.
   But it does have flashes of humor.
   One such flash: How to tell the difference between Republicans
and Democrats.
   The dictionary quotes from the anonymous wit whose musings were
inserted in the Congressional Record some years ago by the late
Craig Hosmer, then a Republican congressman from California.
   To wit:
   ``Democrats buy most of the books that have been banned
somewhere. Republicans form censorship committees and read them as
a group.
   ``Democrats give their worn-out clothes to those less fortunate.
Republicans wear theirs.
   ``Republicans employ exterminators. Democrats step on the bugs.
   ``Democrats name their children after currently popular sports
figures, politicians and entertainers. Republican children are
named after their parents or grandparents, according to where the
most money is.
   ``Republicans tend to keep their shades down, although there is
seldom any reason why they should. Democrats ought to, but don't.
   ``Republicans study the financial pages of the newspaper.
Democrats put them in the bottom of the bird cage.
   ``Republicans raise dahlias, Dalmatians and eyebrows. Democrats
raise Airedales, kids and taxes.
   ``Democrats eat the fish they catch. Republicans hang them on
the wall.
   ``Republican boys date Democratic girls. They plan to marry
Republican girls but feel they're entitled to a little fun first.
   ``Democrats make up plans and then do something else.
Republicans follow the plans their grandparents made.
   ``Republicans sleep in twin beds _ some even in separate rooms.
This is why there are more Democrats.''

   A pizza parlor owner wanted in Italy in
connection with the murder of an Sicilian judge on Monday was
ordered deported by an Immigration and Naturalization Service judge.
   Salvatore Inzerillo, part-owner of a restaurant in Woodbridge,
Va., had asked to be allowed to leave the country voluntarily.
   But Judge Joan V. Arrowsmith denied the request, saying that
would allow Inzerillo to go to the country of his choice. She said
he should be returned to Italy for trial.
   Inzerillo has been in INS custody since Feb. 23. Italian
authorities have issued an arrest warrant for him in the 1980
slaying of Judge Gaetano Costa, who was investigating drug
trafficking in Sicily.
   FBI agent James L. Glass Jr. testified that Inzerillo had
connections with the Mafia, but Inzerillo denied being a member of
the Mafia and said he is not a drug dealer.
   Inzerillo said he hired a smuggler to get him into the United
States in 1981 to seek work. His attorney said he will appeal the
deportation ruling.

<HEAD>Reagan Praises Jayhawks, Lady Techsters For Championships</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan saluted the University of
Kansas Jayhawks and the Lady Techsters of Louisiana Tech for
winning NCAA basketball championships, calling them ``fighters''
who overcame adversity.
   Reagan met the teams Monday in the White House Rose Garden to
honor them for earning the national titles last week.
   ``Now it's no secret that at the beginning of the NCAA
tournament, you Jayhawks, well I suppose the way to put it is to
say you weren't exactly favored to win,'' said Reagan. ``So what
happened is a testament to determination, to hard work, lots and
lots of hard work, to pride, to teamwork and the courage to dream.''
   The Jayhawks defeated the Oklahoma Sooners 83-79 a week ago to
win the men's title, and finished the season 27-11.
   Reagan recounted how the Lady Techsters overcame a 12-point
halftime deficit to defeat Auburn 56-54 in the final moments of
their championship game.
   ``You had a lot of great games this season, but none was greater
than the last,'' the president told the Louisiana Tech team.
   Star guard Teresa Weatherspoon presented Reagan with an
autographed basketball.
   Danny Manning, who scored 31 points in the Jayhawks'
championship win, gave Reagan two KU letter jackets _ one bearing
the president's nickname, ``Dutch,'' and the other for his wife,
Nancy.
   ``We're very thrilled and it's especially an honor to be here,''
said Manning.
   Reagan also took note of an announcement by KU Coach Larry Brown
last week that he intended to remain at KU and not accept the UCLA
coaching job.
   To applause, the president said, ``I know Jayhawk fans
everywhere are rejoicing that next year I'm the only one moving
back to California.''

   China, hoping to increase trade with the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe, has set up five new trade ports and plans
eight more, the official China Daily newspaper said today.
   China says it has a large surplus of labor, arable land and
industrial commodities but is short of timber, electricity and
fertilizer.
   The Soviet Union suffers shortages of labor, agricultural
products and light industrial and textile products but has good
supplies of timber, coal and petroleum, the paper said.
   Presently, China has only three trade ports, all in Heilongjiang
province, bordering the Soviet Union.
   The State Council has given provincial authorities the power to
approve its own export projects, to set up barter trade, to set up
joint projects with the Soviets and to exchange technology.

<TEXT>
   The United States, western Europe and other
big grain producers should create a fund that would help develop
farming in the Third World, French Agriculture Minister Francois
Guillaume says.
   Guillaume says such a plan would help narrow the growing gap
between rich and poor countries. Guillaume spoke Monday at an open
meeting with American officials and farm experts.
   ``Public opinion cannot understand that politicans in the
developed countries are unable to put the grains stored in American
and European silos into the stomachs of men and women in developing
countries,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, both the United States and western Europe are each
spending about $30 billion a year to subsidize farmers, he said.
   During a news conference he described his proposal, under which
grain producers would fix a floor price for grain at a level that
would not stimulate new production. They would then contribute part
of the difference between the floor price and actual selling prices
to a fund that Guillaume likened to the Marshall Plan, which helped
western Europe recover from World War II.
   The fund would be used to improve farming in Third World
countries. He estimated that it could furnish $1.8 billion to $4
billion a year from exporters of grain amd could be increased by
voluntary countributions from rich importers, such as Japan.
   Daniel G. Amstutz, chief U.S. negotiator for world farm issues,
came out strongly against any plan to set prices and limit
production. He said one reason it would not work is that all
producers could not be included and those who did not join would
increase their production.
   The Reagan administration has been pushing a plan to phase out
by the end of the century all subsidies affecting world trade in
farm products.

<TEXT>
   The government on Monday proposed a
resumption of talks with rebels on details of a cease-fire plan
after negotiations ended last week in disagreement over arms
shipments.
   The Sandinista government suggested the technical discussions be
resumed Wednesday or Thursday in Managua, the capital.
   It also proposed that the rebels, known as Contras, send an
advance team to Managua on Tuesday to prepare for discussions
Sandinista and rebel political leaders are scheduled to hold on
Friday.
   In Washington, Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros who is a member
of the special negotiating commission released a statement late
Monday saying the technical talks should resume at noon on
Wednesday in the border village of Sapoa.
   The statement said the Contra's ranking political leaders would
travel to Managua on Friday for negotiations, based on progress at
the Sapoa talks. There was no immediate response from the
government.
   Matamoros' statement said the Contras would send an advance
delegation to Managua Thursday to prepare for the political talks.
It said the Contra representatives would include Roberto Ferrey,
secretary of the directorate of the Contras' umbrella Nicaraguan
Resistance group, and David Stadhagen.
   A preliminary peace plan signed March 23 in Sapoa called for the
two sides to hold technical discussions to work out details of a
60-day cease-fire that went into effect April 1. The talks between
military commanders are to spell out how the Contras are to gather
in cease-fire zones.
   During the truce, the two sides are to hold negotiations leading
to a permanent agreement to end more than six years of war between
the U.S.-backed Contras and the government.
   Military leaders have held six days of technical talks since
March 28 at Sapoa, 90 miles south of Managua and beside the Costa
Rican border.
   They have agreed only on seven zones in which the Contras are to
gather but have failed to decide on security measures and how the
rebels are to receive supplies in the zones.
   The meetings ended Friday after the Contras asked for a recess
of several days to discuss a 25-point plan the government proposed.
The Contras earlier offered a 34-point plan.
   Last week the Sandinistas suggested the technical talks be
resumed Friday, when the political leaders are to hold their
discussions.
   Paul Reichler, an American lawyer negotiating for the
Sandinistas, said over the weekend that there were only two points
of contention in the proposal presented by the Contras.
   The Contra proposals would allow the rebels to receive arms,
ammunition and war materiel while in the zones. It also would ban
the Sandinistas from receiving any military aid, which is supplied
by the Soviet bloc.
   Reichler described those two points as ``absolutely
unacceptable.''
   The original cease-fire plan would permit the Contras to receive
only food and basic supplies channeled through a neutral
organization, such as the International Red Cross.
   Political leaders of both sides had been scheduled to meet last
Wednesday in Managua. The rebels postponed them, saying the
technical talks had not advanced enough to move toward political
issues.
   The rebels also have said they will not participate in this
week's high-level political talks unless they are free to meet with
opposition leaders.
   The government maintains that the peace agreement specifies
Contra representation in politics begins only after the rebels move
into the cease-fire zones.

   Vietnamese biologists reportedly have
sighted a rare Indochinese gray ox for the first time in nearly 20
years, raising hopes the endangered species can be saved from
extinction.
   A newspaper published Monday by the World Wildlife Fund said the
animal, called a kouprey, was seen last year by a Vietnamese team
in a densely forested area near the Laotian border. The sighting
was revealed in January at an international conservation meeting in
Hanoi, the fund said.
   It was important because scientists had begun to fear the animal
might be extinct, at least in Vietnam, said Elizabeth Kemf, who
edits the newspaper.
   Experts are especially interested in the kouprey because it may
be immune to rinderpest, an often fatal infectious disease that
afflicts cattle, sheep and goats, Ms. Kemf told The Associated
Press.
   Scientists want to study the possibility of cross-breeding
kouprey with cattle to render them immune to the intestinal
disease, she said.
   The kouprey is a migratory animal found chiefly in Vietnam, Laos
and Cambodia, and also in Thailand.

   A team of Soviet officials is readying for a
second round of talks aimed at sorting through arrangements for
verifying the arms treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear
weapons.
   The Soviet team of 10 to 14 military and civilian officials was
due in Washington today and planned to meet behind closed doors
with an American group starting on Wednesday, the Pentagon said
Monday.
   According to one U.S. official who asked not to be named, the
talks will extend at least to Saturday and will focus on a variety
of ``housekeeping details'' that must be settled before the two
sides begin compliance inspections.
   ``Some of the topics on the plate include living quarters for
inspectors, call signs for aircraft traveling in each country, the
logistics of moving and putting in place the equipment we'll need
and what equipment we're planning to use, and even how we deal with
the news media,'' said the source.
   The United States and Soviet Union want to reach agreement on
such details in advance of the Senate vote on ratifying the new
treaty to ensure a smooth start for the compliance inspections, the
official added.
   Signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Dec. 8, the new treaty specifies that all nuclear
missiles in the two superpower arsenals with a range of roughly 300
miles to 3,500 miles be destroyed within three years.
   Within the U.S. government, the Pentagon has created an
organization known as the On-Site Inspection Agency to verify
Russian compliance with the new treaty. The head of that agency,
Army Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, will lead the U.S. team in this
week's discussions.
   The two sides held their first round of talks in Moscow last
month.
   The OSIA will be responsible for escorting Soviet inspectors who
travel to the United States and Western Europe to monitor the
removal and destruction of American nuclear weapons, as well as
performing the same role inside the Soviet Union by visiting
Russian facilities and deployment sites.

<HEAD>Discovery Of Most Distant Galaxy Could Change Theories Of Universe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers may have to change their ideas about
the early universe because of the discovery of the oldest and most
distant galaxy ever observed, researchers said.
   The galaxy, about 10 times the size of the Milky Way, was formed
before the universe was a mere 2 billion years old, said its
discoverer, Simon Lilly of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
   Researchers have previously found indirect evidence of galaxies
forming at extreme distances, but this is the first clear
observation of a mature galaxy at those distances, Lilly said
Monday in a telephone interview.
   ``This pushes back the time at which galaxies formed in the
early universe,'' he said.
   The discovery could force a revision in astronomers' conception
of the universe, Lilly said.
   ``If we find more objects like this, the cold-dark-matter
scenario will be in trouble,'' he said.
   That scenario says that most of the universe exists in the form
of cold, dark material that we cannot observe. It also predicts
that massive galaxies like the one discovered should not exist so
early in the history of the universe, Lilly said.
   In January, Richard Elston and George and Marcia Rieke of the
University of Arizona reported the possible existence of even
older, more distant galaxies, but those results are not yet
confirmed, George Rieke said Monday.
   ``I would say he has claim to the most distant galaxy,'' Rieke
said. ``We have claim to having found candidates that may be even
more distant, but that's different from having it nailed down.''
   Nevertheless, Rieke said, the two lines of research mesh nicely,
because ``the existence of his galaxy implies that something like
the galaxies that we have candidates for must exist.''
   Harding Smith, a physicist at the University of California, San
Diego, who has studied distant galaxies, said Lilly ``has made a
substantial jump, and I do think it's an important result.''
   It will help astronomers understand the processes that form
galaxies, Smith said. ``We don't understand when they form and how
they form, and both of these are very interesting questions because
they may tell us more about what happened even earliier in the
universe,'' Smith said.
   A report of Lilly's work has been accepted for publication in
the Astrophysical Journal, he said.
   To determine an object's distance and age, astronomers observe
the so-called redshift of light emitted by the object. The higher
the redshift, the older and more distant the object.
   Lilly's galaxy has a redshift of 3.4, he said. The oldest and
most distant galaxy observed before his had a redshift of 1.8, he
said.
   The Arizona researchers are searching for evidence of new
galaxies at redshifts of 6 to 25, Rieke said.
   The age of the universe cannot be precisely determined, Lilly
said, but the best estimates put it at between 10 billion and 20
billion years.
   If a figure of 15 billion years is arbitrarily chosen as a
starting point, then the redshift of Lilly's galaxy means the light
that Lilly observed left the galaxy when the universe was about 3
billion years old.
   Observations of the galaxy itself indicate it was then 1 billion
or 2 billion years old, he said, meaning it was formed when the
universe was 1 billion to 2 billion years old.
   Lilly said his research involved identifying the source of a
distant emission of radio waves that was recorded in 1981.
   He used the Canada-France-Hawaii optical telescope and the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope _ both located atop Hawaii's
Mauna Kea volcano _ to pick up light and infrared radiation from
the precise point where the radio emission had been detected. Those
observations allowed him to identify it as a mature galaxy.

<HEAD>Sweden & Finland Asked To Monitor Troop Withdrawal From

<TEXT>
   The United Nations has asked Sweden to
monitor the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, a
government spokeswoman said.
   Finland already has agreed to a similar request, Sweden's
national television reported.
   Spokeswoman Annika Wiren on Monday said the U.N. request was
informal and that the Swedish government had not yet made a
decision. However, she said Sweden's ``stand in principal is
positive'' in such matters.
   The United Nations recently announced an agreement to end the
war between Moslem guerrillas and Afghanistan's Soviet-backed
government and clear the way for the removal of an estimated
115,000 Soviet troops.

   Riding the Jesse Jackson press bus at times
can be like attending a meeting of the United Nations.
   Jackson has attracted intense interest by the international news
media _ in part, because of what one Frenchman called his ``star''
quality. News agencies from all over the world have sent writers
and TV crews to cover his bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   ``The campaigns of the other candidates are so boring that Jesse
Jackson is the only one to emerge,'' said Paris Match correspondent
Oliver Royant.
   The foreign coverage is increasing in anticipation of the
crucial New York primary on April 19, his aides say.
   Traveling with Jackson's entourage last weekend were reporters
from Ecuador, Lebanon, France, Japan, Great Britain, Canada, Italy
and West Germany. Off and on, the campaign also has seen
representatives from news agencies of other nations including
Denmark and Holland.
   At one point campaign aides even considered having a news
conference just for the foreign press _ because all wanted
interviews with the candidate and their questions were of a
different nature than those asked by U.S. reporters, said press
secretary DelMarie Cobb.
   The interest seems to center on Jackson as a person and
international celebrity, his eloquence and flair, and on the
historical significance of his candidacy.
   Foreign reporters said they were looking for those kinds of
stories more than at Jackson's stance on issues.
   Cobb said the foreign press also asks a lot of questions about
whether the United States is ready to elect a black president.
   On the other hand, Raghida Dergham of the London-based Lebanese
magazine Al-Hawadress said editors in the Middle East are very
interested in the foreign policies of Jackson, who enjoys
considerable support in the Arab-American community.
   British Broadcasting Corp. correspondent Kent Barker said
Jackson was ``certainly the most interesting to foreign eyes. He's
the most colorful, dramatic'' presidential candidate this year.
   The BBC's audience is also interested in Jackson's liberalism
and sees him as aligned with the philosophies of the Labor Party in
Great Britain, he said.
   In Italy, people are more aware of Jackson than the other
candidates, even though RAI television has done a profile on
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, said RAI cameraman Michele
Capasso. He cited ``the style and excitement around him'' as
reasons Jackson makes a good story.
   ``In France, every U.S. election, people want to know two
things,'' said Royant of Paris Match. ``Are we going to find a
Kennedy this year? ... Who is the star? This year Jesse Jackson is
the star.''
   Paris Match did a profile of Jackson in October, and Royant is
working on a second profile that will appear some time before the
summer nominating conventions. Jackson has visited France in the
past and is well-known there, said Royant.
   Additionally, there is interest in the candidacy of a black man
20 years after the death of civil rights leader Martin Luther King,
Royant said.

Notices</HEAD>

   The Democratic presidential contenders are
telling Congress to disregard President Reagan's threat to veto a
trade bill if it calls for mandatory advance layoff notices.
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore and Jesse Jackson sent letters over
the weekend urging Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, a key architect of
the sweeping trade bill, to resist further weakening of the
labor-sought notice provision.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis earlier had sent a similar
letter to Bentsen, urging him to retain the notice provision
``regardless of the president's intentions.''
   The letters arrived on Capitol Hill as Gore, Jackson and Dukakis
are engaged in an intense competition for the 255 convention
delegates at stake in the April 19 primary in New York, a state
where one in every three workers carries a union card.
   ``I can only conclude that the real reason many companies oppose
a notice requirement _ and the reason those same companies do not
give advance notice now _ is that they do not care what happens to
workers or their communities,'' Gore said in his letter.
   Jackson said his campaign speeches on the need for advance
layoff notices have received enthusiastic responses and that ``it
is difficult to believe that Congress would not override such an
ill-advised veto.''
   ``The inclusion of the provision in the trade bill has been
helpful in making working people aware that the Congress is
responding to some of their very fundamental concerns,'' he said in
his letter to Bentsen.
   The AFL-CIO, which has made the trade bill its top legislative
priority for six years, has threatened to withdraw its support for
it entirely if the layoff notices are eliminated.
   ``I could understand our so-called trading partners being
opposed to the bill,'' AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Thomas R.
Donahue said Monday. ``But he's (Reagan) supposed to be the
president of the United States.''
   Under the provision, companies with more than 100 employees
would be required to give 60 days advance notice when they intend
to close a plant or lay off one-third or more of its workforce.
However, the layoffs would have to total at least 50 workers to
trigger the mandatory notices.
   Bentsen and other Senate and House ``superconferees'' are
scheduled to start meeting today in hopes of getting a final
version of the trade bill by Thursday or Friday for separate votes
in each house on final passage.
   Without citing specific provisions, Reagan said in his weekend
radio address Saturday he still has ``very _ underline very _
serious reservations'' about the bill.
   ``The bottom line is this: I will veto a bad trade bill before I
let a bad trade bill veto our economy.''
   While administration officials have outlined objections to
several provisions, congressional leaders describe most of the
protests as ``padding'' for its vehement opposition to the
mandatory layoff notices.
   ``It's a classic game of everybody trying to figure out what the
other guy's bottom line is,'' said one legislative aide, who
acknowledged one purpose of the candidates' letters is to counter
administration veto threats.
   Just a week ago, Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin wrote Senate
Democratic Leader Robert Byrd she would be ``forced to recommend
that the president veto the bill ... if these protectionist
mandatory plant closing and layoff requirements remain.''
   A Labor Department task force last year called advance notices
``an essential component of a readjustment program'' for helping
laid off workers get new jobs, but stopped short of saying the
notices should be mandated.
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, two of every three
workers laid off in the United States receive no advance notice.
   The average notice, according to a separate survey by the
General Accounting Office, is 14 days for white-collar workers and
seven days for blue-collar workers.

   This Sierra Nevada foothill community
had a bear of a weekend, and loved it.
   Some 10,000 teddy bears were on hand to be cuddled, admired and
enjoyed by 6,000 humans, who also indulged in music, food, clown
performances, shopping and story telling.
   Besides the bears of all shapes and sizes at the Nevada City's
Fifth Annual International Teddy Bear Convention, there were grown
men in furry bear suits and teenagers wearing fuzzy ears. There
were toddlers and grandmothers alike clutching favorite teddy bears.
   And if some looked askance at the goings-on at the American
Victorian Museum and the nearby teddy-bear castle, 3{-year-old
Sydney Gerson of Nevada City wasn't among them.
   After getting a couple of big hugs from a shaggy brown cinnamon
bear, Sydney beamed and said, ``I love teddy bears a lot because
they are so soft and snuggly.''
   The ``teddy'' bear title, according to the story repeated at the
convention, was given a small stuffed bear by a Brooklyn candy
store owner who read of the refusal of President Theodore ``Teddy''
Roosevelt to shoot a small bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902.
   The vendor, who later founded the Ideal Toy Co., sent his
creation to the president, who kept it for his children.

   Glenn Harrington's rhinoceros may be an
unlikely cross between a bull and a Buick, but he says he'll miss
the life-size, metallic sculpture when it moves to a Ripley's
Believe It Or Not museum.
   ``The mountains are no place for an 8-year-old rhinoceros,''
Harrington said. ``It's time he moved to a lower elevation and a
warmer climate.''
   The rhino was made about eight years ago from old steel
automobile bumpers by ``bumper sculpture'' artist Jon Bedford, a
former Salida resident. Harrington bought it for display in front
of his hardware business on U.S. 50.
   When the business closed a year ago, the rhino moved to the
front lawn of Harrington's home.
   ``We felt it didn't belong in a private yard,'' Harrington said.
``It should be in a public place, where people can see and
appreciate it.''
   So Harrington put the rhino up for sale, advertising it at a
gallery in Taos, N.M., where Bedford now works. Last week, word
came that the rhino was sold to Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum
in Laguna Beach, Calif.
   Still, Harrington says, he'll miss the old beast.
   ``The rhino brought a lot of interesting comments and situations
when we were at the store,'' he said. ``There was the old rancher
from Saguache, for example. He showed up one morning, just as I was
opening the store, and he stood outside for a long time, studying
that rhinoceros.
   ```When he finally came in he said, `I know where that came
from. ... It's a cross between a Brahma bull and a Buick.'''

   A University of Massachusetts student
judiciary board agreed Monday to settle a dispute over a
communist's election as co-president of the student body.
   The three-member student Supreme Court heard a motion Monday
night that would declare the election invalid. John Sanchez, the
panel's chief judge, said a ruling on the motion would be issued
Wednesday prior to a scheduled meeting of the undergraduate Student
Senate.
   Jason Rabinowitz, a member of the Young Communist League, and
his co-candidate, non-communist Shari Silkoff, were elected March
15. Rabinowitz is believed to be the first YCL member elected
campus president since the group was formed five years ago.
   Student Attorney General William Collins filed the motion asking
the judiciary board to declare the Rabinowitz-Silkoff ticket
invalid because the student government constitution allows only one
person to hold the office of president.
   ``I think I'm winning,'' Collins said after the session, ``but
the point is I can't just win. I have to win convincingly.''
   Monday night's hearing was mostly spent on arguments by a
student lawyer representing Rabinowitz and Silkoff, who attempted
to show that the writers of the student constitution did not mean
to prevent more than one person from serving.
   Conservatives on the 90-member undergraduate student senate
filibustered last week to keep the election from being ratified and
stop Rabinowitz and Silkoff from taking office.
   Collins said his motion had nothing to do with the candidates'
political beliefs, but Rabinowitz contended otherwise.
   ``He's more interested in petty factional politics than the
well-being of the whole student government,'' said Rabinowitz, a
20-year-old junior from New York City.
   Rabinowitz and Silkoff, also 20, won 1,454 votes, 391 more than
conservative candidate Aram Hamparian, at the 19,000-student campus.

<HEAD>Michael Douglas Awarded First Acting Award, Second Oscar for
``Wall Street''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Douglas, the ruthless inside trader
of ``Wall Street,'' won his second Oscar and first acting award
Monday night at the 60th Annual Academy Awards ceremony.
   Douglas previously won an Oscar for being one of the producers
of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' best picture of 1975.
   When accepting the award, Douglas credited ``Wall Street''
director Oliver Stone ``for having the courage to cast me in a part
that not many people thought I could play.''
   Douglas described the character of Wall Street king Gordon Gekko
as ``the best part that I've ever had in my career.''
   The actor also thanked his wife and his parents, especially his
father, actor Kirk Douglas, ``for helping a son step out of the
shadow.''
   Douglas also had been considered by the Academy for his
performance in the psycho-thriller ``Fatal Attraction,'' which was
nominated for best picture, but the actors branch of the Academy
decided to nominate him for ``Wall Street.''
   Marlee Matlin, who won the best actress Oscar last year for
``Children of a Lesser God,'' presented the award, using sign
language, but speaking aloud the names of nominees Douglas, William
Hurt, Marcello Mastroianni, Jack Nicholson, and Robin Williams.
   Douglas' film debut was with ``Hail, Hero.'' He spent four years
with the ABC-TV series ``The Streets of San Francisco,'' and became
established as a movie star with the smash-hit adventure films
``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Jewel of the Nile.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment banking firm Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. came under attack during a congressional hearing for
what one senator said was its role as a corporate raider in a
hostile takeover.
   ``In effect, what we have is a bank acting as a corporate
raider,'' Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said Monday at a hearing of the
Senate Banking Committee. The committee met for three hours on the
attempted takeover of Pittsburgh-based Koppers by Beazer PLC of
Britain, which is being advised by Shearson Lehman.
   ``Shearson is only the first to cross a line that Wall Street
believes will be obliterated by others racing across it in the
future,'' said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., referring to the distinction
between banking and commerce.
   Steven B. Wolitzer, managing director of Shearson, said the
firm's role was limited to providing short-term, or ``bridge,''
financing for Beazer's tender offer and giving advice. Such
financing is ``typical for investment banks in deals of this
kind,'' he said.
   Wolitzer acknowledged that Shearson is contributing equity of
its own _ $23 million _ to the bidding group, but he said
management and control of the group would be held by Beazer PLC.
   But Charles R. Pullin, chairman and chief executive officer of
Koppers, said Shearson ``has dominated and actively guided every
aspect of the planning and execution of the Koppers takeover
attempt since its secret initiation one year ago.''
   Brian C. Beazer, chairman and chief executive officer of the
British company, defended the takeover attempt, saying his
company's goal is ``not to make a quick buck by laying off
employees, and selling the company's operations piecemeal.''
   ``I am not a corporate raider,'' Beazer said. He said Koppers'
management has mounted ``a massive campaign of disinformation''
about his bid.
   Beazer led a group that made an unsolicited cash tender offer of
$45 a share for Koppers on March 3, a deal that has since been
sweetened to $60 per share, or $1.7 billion. Koppers produces
construction materials and chemicals.
   ``From an American Express Co. viewpoint, not only do we think
this to be a Shearson transaction and activity in the normal course
of its business, but we also view the uproar by some allies of
Koppers as ill-informed, provocative and ill-advised,'' said Harry
L. Freeman, executive vice president of American Express,
Shearson's parent.
   He said it was ill-informed because of the ``continued erroneous
assertion that somehow Shearson, rather than Beazer, is trying to
acquire Koppers, which is simply not true and strikes the
management of American Express Co. as a bizarre allegation.''
   Beazer's offer has been extended until April 15 while courts
consider legal challenges by Koppers that have slowed the takeover
bid.

   Will Cornelia ``Super Deb'' Guest and Sylvester
``Rambo'' Stallone unite in matrimony, creating a gossip

Guest, says she thinks a marriage would be ``wonderful. He's
terrific, a big achiever, and he works very hard _ well, he's

   Abel Kiviat, the world's oldest Olympic
champion, has outlasted the gold and silver medals he won in the
1912 Stockholm games. In fact, he says, he hasn't seen them since
they were lost nearly 60 years ago.
   So on Thursday, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, the grandson of
the man who originally awarded Kiviat his medals, will present the
95-year-old former runner with specially crafted duplicates during
a visit to Trenton.
   Glenn Kasper, a member of the Governor's Council on Physical
Fitness, came up with the idea of replacing the original medals
after taking Kiviat home from an Olympic fund-raising event in
February.
   ``I knew the king and queen were coming here and I thought,
`Wouldn't it be great if we could get replacement medals to give to
Abel?''' Kasper asked.
   In the 1912 Olympics, when he was a roommate of Decathlon
champion Jim Thorpe, Kiviat won the silver medal in the 1,500-meter
run and the gold medal in the 3,000-meter cross-country event.

   William Styron, author of ``Sophie's
Choice'' and other prize-winning fiction, will receive the 1988
Edward MacDowell Medal ``for his unique insight and vision of the
American novel,'' a writer's group said.
   Styron, 62, is being recognized for his novels, articles and
essays, including the 1967 book ``The Confessions of Nat Turner,''
which won a Pulitzer Prize, and ``Sophie's Choice,'' which won the
1980 American Book Award.
   ``Through his works, he has helped us understand man's
limitations. He has taught us lessons about the human condition,
about how to survive, about right and wrong,'' Mary Carswell,
executive director of the MacDowell Colony for artists, said Monday.
   ``We will honor William Styron for his contribution to American
literature and for his unique insight and vision of the American
novel,'' she said. The MacDowell Colony is an artist's retreat
founded in 1907 by composer Edward McDowell and his wife, Marian.
   Styron was chosen by a committee of seven American literary
figures. It was chaired by John Updike, a former MacDowell
medalist, and included Michael Blumenthal, Brendan Gill, Elizabeth
Hardwick, Norman Mailer, Elizabeth Sifton and Robert Taylor.
   Among the 28 previous medalists: writers Thornton Wilder, Eudora
Welty and Lillian Hellman; composers Aaron Copland, Leonard
Bernstein and William Schuman; and visual artists Georgia O'Keeffe,
Willem de Kooning and Louise Nevelson.

   Grammy-winning jazz guitarist Larry Carlton
is slowly recuperating after being shot in the neck by two teen-age
intruders, but police have failed to identify the suspects or their
motive, a detective said.
   ``The last I heard he was still in stable condition, and seems
to be better the last couple days,'' Detective Rick Swanston said
Monday.
   Carlton, 40, underwent four hours of surgery for a single
gunshot wound to the neck when he was brought to St. Joseph Medical
Center in Burbank after Wednesday's attack at his Hollywood Hills
home. He was later transferred to an undisclosed hospital for
security reasons.
   Carlton won a Grammy this year for best pop instrumental for his
version of the Doobie Brothers' ``Minute By Minute.'' In 1981, he
shared a Grammy with pianist Mike Post for the theme to ``Hill
Street Blues.''
   Police have not been able to identify the shooting suspects,
Swanston said.

out of the public eye when his father became president, but he
ended up pursuing an acting career after Gerald R. Ford himself

   Ford, who was 18 when his father succeeded Richard Nixon in
1974, said he had little interest in attending state dinners and
other White House functions.
   ``I left home and spent most of my time out west in Montana,
Utah and Idaho, '' he said at a recent appearance here.
   Ford, 31, said he had been on the professional rodeo curcuit for

Later, he played in the daytime soap opera ``The Young and the

   ``It wasn't hard to see where the money was,'' he said.

   Olympia Dukakis took the best supporting
actress Oscar for ``Moonstruck'' Monday night, then hoisted the
statuette in the air and urged on first cousin Michael Dukakis
with: ``OK Michael, let's go!''
   The nomination was the first for Miss Dukakis, who has long been
a working actress in theater, films and television, but failed to
reach a national audience until she played Cher's wise and enduring
Italian mother in ``Moonstruck.''
   After hearing her name announced from among nominees Anne
Ramsey, Norma Aleandro, Anne Archer, and Ann Sothern, Miss Dukakis
said she was ``very honored'' by the award and thanked her family,
friends and colleagues, then hollered, ``OK Michael, let's go.''
   Backstage, she declared: ``It's the year of the Dukaki!'' and
said she hoped her good fortune would help her cousin, who is
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. She was eager to
telephone the Massachusetts governor who was campaigning in New
York in anticipation of the state's primary.
   Miss Dukakis said she planned to run for election as a delegate
to the Democratic National Convention from New Jersey.
   Like her cousin, the actress grew up in a Greek family in which
everybody argued politics. After graduating from Boston University,
she worked as a physical therapist to earn enough money to return
and study theater arts.
   She remains the artistic director of the Whole Theater in
Montclair, N.J., and says of her new-found fame: ``I'm not
convinced that this being a celebrity is going to be long-lived.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis celebrated his cousin's
Academy Award and, with his eye on New York's important
presidential primary, said ``I hope it's an omen for next week.''
   Dukakis talked to cousin Olympia Dukakis by telephone Monday
night shortly after she won an Oscar for her supporting role in the
movie ``Moonstruck.''
   The Massachusetts governor made his call from a Greenwich
Village restaurant that figured in the movie and was decorated with
photos and posters from it. Dining on pasta and lamb chops, Dukakis
watched a videotaped replay of his cousin's award and clapped when
she waved her statuette and said, ``OK, Michael, let's go!''
   He had just seen the movie the night before.
   ``You're fantastic, you're unbelievable,'' he gushed on the
telephone. ``You're radiant. ... I'm so happy for you.''
   ``What are we doing here, you and I, just a couple of street
kids?'' he asked.
   Dukakis, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, had
been saying all afternoon as he campaigned around New York City
that an Oscar victory could be a harbinger for his presidential
candidacy in next Tuesday's primary.
   ``I hope it's an omen for next week,'' he said. ``I hope it's a
good sign for the `Dukaki' _ all of them.''
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis bid for Jewish support and sided
with Israel in blaming Arab leaders for violence in the West Bank.
He found no fault with Israel's policies or use of force in dealing
with Palestinian uprisings, but he also absolved the young Arab
protesters, saying they have been misled by their leaders.
   ``It is critically important that the world understand who is
responsible for the turmoil and the violence,'' he told the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
   ``It is not the generation of young Palestinians who have grown
up in uncertainty.'' he said. ``It is not a government in Jerusalem
that struggles to maintain order. ... It is, regrettably, Arab
leaders themselves, who have time and again rejected the chance to
sit down with Israel and negotiate a permanent peace in the Middle
East.''
   Dukakis' appearance before the group of leaders from 44 major
national Jewish organizations was an effort to attract support from
Jews, who make up some one-quarter of the Democratic primary
electorate in New York, where the state's huge delegate prize is at
stake next Tuesday.
   Rival Albert Gore Jr. appeared before the group earlier, drawing
a distinction with Dukakis in opposing a letter signed by 30
senators urging Secretary of State George Shultz to press Israel to
come to a peaceful resolution of the West Bank and Gaza violence.
Leaders of the group said Democrat Jesse Jackson, who has drawn
opposition from some Jews for his 1984 reference to New York as
``Hymietown,'' declined an invitation.
   Dukakis faced questions that appeared to challenge him to go
further in drawing distinctions between himself and Jackson,
including one questioner who called Jackson an ``anti-Semite.''
Others pressed him to state opposition to creation of an
independent Palestinian state _ which Dukakis refused to do, saying
that was a matter for Israel and its neighbors to negotiate.
   He was also asked to state a position on the future of
Jerusalem. Dukakis initially said Jerusalem too was ``subject to
negotiation.'' He later told reporters, however, that ``I'm for a
united Jerusalem'' under Israeli control.
   ``Always have been,'' he said.
   He said Jerusalem ``will remain the capital and should remain
the capital'' of Israel.
   Dukakis refused to be drawn into a personal characterization of
Jackson on the Jewish issue. But he cited several differences with
Jackson, such as Jackson's call for returning corporate taxes to
1980 levels, and in general on the Middle East.
   Dukakis also spoke to a large gathering of supporters at an
evening rally on Staten Island.
   He urged them to ignore polls showing him ahead, saying he lost
his 1978 re-election bid despite a lead of as much as 50 points in
polls. ``I've learned from that experience,'' he said.

   ``Beatlejuice,'' a ghostly comedy starring
Michael Keaton, remained the nation's top-grossing movie for a
second week, followed by Neil Simon's comedy ``Biloxi Blues'' and
the religious cult thriller ``Bad Dreams.''
   Academy Award publicity gave ``Moonstruck'' enough increase in
box office gross to return it to a spot in the top 10 last weekend.
   ``Bad Dreams'' and the police thriller ``Above the Law'' made
their first appearances on the list, taking Nos. 3 and 8,
respectively. But ``Above the Law'' had the highest per-screen
average gross, $5,822, slightly ahead of the $5,691 for
``Beetlejuice.''
   ``Beetlejuice'' _ in which Keaton plays a ``bio-exorcist'' hired
by a dead couple to rid their home of its new, living occupants _
was shown on 523 more screens than the previous week, maintaining
its No. 1 spot for a second week with a weekend gross of $8.67
million and a total of $22.91 million.
   ``Biloxi Blues,'' knocked out of the top spot by ``Beetlejuice''
a week ago, stayed in second place as Matthew Broderick's portrayal
of an Army boot camp private drew nearly $4.48 million more for a
total take of $23.2 million.
   ``Bad Dreams,'' about the haunting dreams of the only survivor
of a religious cult's mass suicide, had the weekend's third-highest
gross, nearly $4.01 million.
   Fourth place went to the apocalyptic ``The Seventh Sign,'' with
$3.13 million.
   Michael J. Fox's portrayal of a cocaine-snorting yuppie in
``Bright Lights, Big City,'' dropped from third to fifth, with
$3.09 million.
   Disney saw its re-release of ``The Fox and the Hound'' fall from
fourth to sixth with a weekend take of $2.56 million, while
Disney's comedy ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' stayed No. 7 with a $2.37
million gross.
   ``Above the Law,'' with its nonstop violence, placed eighth with
nearly $2.04 million for its first weekend.
   ``Moonstruck,'' with six Oscar nominations, finished ninth with
$1.82 million.
   No. 10 was the college football recruiting farce ``Johnny Be
Good,'' which took in $1.61 million.
   Here are the top films as tallied by Exhibitor Relations Co.

<HEAD>Whale Sighted In Delaware River Near Delaware and New Jersey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A whale was sighted swimming in the
Delaware River Monday, and the Coast Guard warned small boaters to
stay away from the area.
   The Coast Guard, the state marine police and members of the New
Jersey Marine Stranding Center plan to search for the whale
Tuesday, said David Small, spokesman for the Department of Natural
Resources and Environmental Control.
   They and the National Marine Fisheries Service will try to guide
the whale out to sea Tuesday, said a Coast Guard officer.
   ``We've heard reports that it's been out in the (Delaware) Bay
for a couple of days, and that it's up the river near the port of
Wilmington,'' said Small, but he said that state natural resources
officials have not seen the whale themselves.
   The whale has been reported as 35 to 50 feet long, officials
said.
   The Coast Guard in Gloucester, N.J., received a report from a
passing tug about 3:30 p.m. that a whale was in the vicinity of the
Delaware Memorial Bridge, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Keith
Ferguson. The bridge crosses the Delaware River about 30 miles
south of Philadelphia, and connects Delaware and New Jersey.
   ``The Coast Guard is recommending that recreational and private
vessels exercise extreme caution in transiting the Delaware River
in the vicinity of the Delaware Memorial Bridge due to the size and
temperment of the whale,'' Ferguson said. ``The whale could inflict
serious damage to a small boater.''
   Small said he had never heard of a whale swimming up the river
to the industrialized Wilmington-Philadelphia area before, although
whales have been sighted in the bay.

   An indigent art historian says he couldn't afford
to present his side of the case before he was convicted of
transporting stolen historic documents, including letters from
Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill.
   Charles Merrill Mount, a Brooklyn native who affects the accent
and manners of a British gentleman, says he will appeal Monday's
conviction for transporting goods belonging to the National
Archives and Library of Congress.
   ``This was not a trial. It was only a hearing of government
allegations,'' said Mount. ``A trial is when both sides present
their case. It did not happen here. ... The government wanted a
conviction and they got a conviction.''
   The 59-year-old historian and author faces up to 10 years in
prison and a $500,000 fine when he is sentenced in U.S. District
Court. He was released on $50,000 bail pending sentencing May 23.
   Charles McGinty, Mount's public defender, said he will appeal on
grounds that the court should have paid transportation costs for
two Irish men Mount wanted as defense witnesses. Mount, whose
$18,400 in savings was seized by the government following the
arrest, claimed his status as indigent required prosecutors to pay
to bring witnesses to Boston.
   At issue were 166 documents, including letters by Lincoln,
Churchill, artist James McNeill Whistler and author Henry James,
that allegedly belonged to the Library of Congress but were sold by
Mount to Goodspeed's Book Shop in Boston for about $20,000 in July.
   Mount, a respected art historian and former Guggenheim
Foundation fellow, said he owned the documents for years, and
showed some of them to the two Irish men, including the president
of a national art academy, in the 1960s in Dublin.
   The government said Mount gained access to the documents last
May and July. Goodspeed's officials had contacted the FBI after the
first transaction with Mount.
   Only one witness appeared for the defense during the three-week
trial, a Nebraska woman who met Mount in a hotel in Ireland in 1961
and said she saw some documents. She paid her fare to Boston.
   The jury deliberated four hours Friday and met for 2{ hours
Monday before returning the verdict.
   Mount also was indicted on possession of federal property
charges by a grand jury in Washington. Frank L. McNamara Jr., U.S.
attorney in Boston, said he did not know if federal prosecutors
would pursue those possession charges.
   Claire Rochefort, a manuscript director at Goodspeed's who
purchased the documents from Mount, is pleased the documents may
return to the National Archives.
   ``They are part of our national heritage,'' said Rochefort. ``We
would like to be reimbursed, but to get the documents back is the
most important thing.''
   Mount, who changed his name from Stanley Merrill Suchow in the
1950s, said he will return to his room in a Washington boarding
house.

<HEAD>Dave Prater Sr. Of Sam And Dave Soul Group Dies At 50</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PATERSON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dave Prater Sr. of the Sam and Dave soul
duo, who recorded such hits as ``Soul Man'' and ``Hold On I'm
Comin,''' has died at age 50 in a Georgia car accident.
   Prater was on his way to visit his mother, Mary, in Ocilla, the
small Georgia town where he grew up, his widow, Rosemary, said
Monday. The Praters have lived in Paterson since 1974 and his body
will be returned to New Jersey for burial next week, she said.
   ``Dave was very strong and very able and entertaining was his
life,'' Mrs. Prater said of her husband.
   Prater met partner Sam Moore in Miami in 1958. Their
Memphis-style soul won them popularity through the 1960s and a
Grammy Award for ``Soul Man.'' But by the early 1970s, their
popularity had waned, and in 1981, Moore and Prater broke up.
   Prater revived the Sam and Dave act in 1982 with a new partner,
Sam Daniels of Miami.
   Daniels said he saw Prater the Sunday before he died when they
performed together in Atlanta.
   ``I still feel a little shocked,'' he said Monday night.
   Sam and Dave gained further popularity when the Blues Brothers
of ``Saturday Night Live'' fame, Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi, had
a hit with ``Soul Man.''
   Lately, Prater had run into trouble with drugs, although Mrs.
Prater said he seemed to have the problem beat.
   Prater was arrested last summer in Paterson for selling a vial
of crack to an undercover police officer. He pleaded guilty and was
sentenced March 5 to three years probation and was ordered to pay a
$2,580 fine and perform 150 of community service.
   A funeral service will be held for Prater in Ocilla on Thursday
and his body will be flown back to New Jersey for burial Monday at
a Totowa cemetery, his wife said.
   Prater also is survived by five children from an earlier
marriage.

<HEAD>Air Force Reverses Decision To Close 37 Units</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force says its decision against
closing or consolidating 37 ROTC units across the country also will
mean a delay in its efforts to save more than $10 million a year on
that program.
   In a letter to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the Air Force said
that while the decision will delay anticipated savings, the Air
Force secretary ``is sensitive to the impact of the prior decision
for closure-consolidation.''
   The decision to cut the programs would be reviewed again at the
end of the spring term of 1990, but plans would go forward to
reduce the number of AFROTC commissioned officers by 15 percent
over the next two years, according to the letter from Lt. Col.
Timothy L. Titus, a legislative liaison officer.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Finance Committee, wrote in January to
Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge Jr. to complain the closures
would have a disproportionate impact on Texas, ``a state with a
long and proud tradition of military service which has also
welcomed military activities.''
   Texas and North Carolina stood to lose more ROTC units than any
other states if the Air Force had gone through with its plans,
announced in January, to close 30 of its 151 ROTC units and
consolidate another seven with nearby schools. Both states would
have lost four programs each.
   The Air Force said in a letter Monday to Bentsen that the move
would have cut 200 positions and saved more than $10 million
annually. The armed services are searching for $32.9 billion of
spending cuts in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1, to comply with
budget limits established in November in a deficit-reduction plan.
   ``Without a steady inflow of bright, energetic younger officers
_ particularly from the AFROTC units _ the Air Force may lose some
of its vigor and diversity,'' Bentsen said in his letter.
   The Air Force had planned to phase in the closures over 18
months to allow 1,197 juniors and seniors in the 37 affected
programs to complete their studies. The affected units, where young
officers are groomed for active service, have a current four-year
enrollment of 4,448.
   Lt. Col. Jan Dalby, an Air Force spokesman, said the Air Force
withdrew its plans after determining the criteria to identify units
targeted for closure or consolidation had not been spelled out to
the schools involved.
   ``They did not know the criteria they would be judged by,''
Dalby said. ``The decision was unfair without knowing how they were
being looked at. The issue we dealt with was primarily fairness.''
   ``We believe a two-year postponement of our efforts to close or
consolidate AFROTC units will provide sufficient notice to affected
units as well as their host colleges and universities,''
   The Air Force released a statement saying that although many of
the AFROTC programs marked for closure were performing well under
AFROTC standards, ``they were identified as being the least
cost-effective AFROTC programs under new criteria developed for the
closure plan.''

<HEAD>Senate Moving Toward Approval of $1.1 Trillion Federal Budget</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Senate resumes debate 11:30 a.m. EDT; top planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is moving toward approval of a $1.1
trillion federal budget for fiscal 1989 that some lawmakers say
does more to mask the size of the government's enormous deficit
than it does to slash it.
   Senate leaders predicted that despite those reservations the
chamber could approve the spending plan as early as today. The
proposal, which has received rare bipartisan support, cleared its
first procedural hurdle Monday when senators voted 83-0 to begin
debating the budget resolution.
   The fiscal 1989 blueprint estimates a deficit of $136 billion,
precisely the target set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law
for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. This year's deficit
is expected to reach $146.7 billion.
   But helping to keep the red ink down is a $46 billion surplus
the Social Security system is expected to amass next year. Even
though that money is being built up in anticipation of retirements
by the baby boomers in the early 21st century _ and cannot be used
for anything else _ the annual surpluses were included in the
budget's arithmetic and make the deficit look smaller.
   In addition, the Senate, like the House, relied on an optimistic
administration economic forecast to arrive at its projected
deficit. Had the lawmakers used the less cheerful projections of
their own Congressional Budget Office, the red ink would have been
$35 billion higher.
   ``We need to quit fooling ourselves in talking about a $136
billion deficit,'' Sen. Lawton Chiles, chairman of the budget
committee, said during debate. ``It's just not correct.''
   Chiles, D-Fla., planned to introduce an amendment that would
urge Congress to stop using Social Security surpluses in
calculating the deficit.
   Other amendments were anticipated to shift money among several
domestic programs.
   But the main fights that normally dominate budget debates _ how
to balance domestic and military spending, and whether to raise
taxes _ are not present this year. Those questions were settled
last fall, when President Reagan and congressional leaders reached
their so-called budget summit agreement.
   The Senate budget resolution obeys the summit agreement's limits
in calling for $294 billion in military spending next year, $16.1
billion for foreign assistance and $169.2 billion for domestic
programs in which spending is not set by automatic formulas.
   In addition, there will be no new taxes beyond the $14 billion
called for in the summit and already enacted into law.
   ``I don't think we can afford this year to breach the summit
agreement,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, ranking
Republican on the budget panel. ``I think we ought to enforce it,
and I think we've done that rather well.''
   With the major fights out of the way, the House passed its
version of the budget resolution March 23 on a bipartisan 319-102
vote.
   In that chamber, as in the Senate, lawmakers have some
significant differences with the domestic priorities Reagan set in
the budget he submitted to Congress in February. The Senate
proposal does not eliminate or severely slash a series of federal
mass transit and economic development programs, as Reagan wanted.
It also calls for about $1 billion more than Reagan did for
Medicare.
   But, in line with Reagan recommendations, it would increase
spending for AIDS research, education, space, science and drug
enforcement.
   The budget resolution does not require the president's
signature, but the two chambers must agree on an identical version
before it takes effect. The document will be used later as a
blueprint by Congress when it passes bills that actually provide
the money for federal agencies.

<HEAD>Fatal Last Words Studied To Help Prevent Other Suicides</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Spelling of Leenaars is cq.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``No one should feel bad about my going. I'm not
worth it,'' begins one of the 1,200 suicide notes collected by a
Canadian psychologist who will be honored this week for his
pioneering study of fatal last words.
   The note was left by a middle-aged Los Angeles man who shot
himself after an unhappy love affair, said Dr. Antoons Leenaars,
37, of Windsor, Ontario.
   Collected from coroners' offices and bereaved loved ones, the
notes provide the raw material the Dutch-born psychotherapist is
analyzing to determine why people take their own lives and how they
might be saved.
   ``We're looking for the common factors so that we can predict
(suicide attempts) and intervene in those cases where the person
might want us to intervene,'' he said in an interview. ``A long
time ago I learned that you can help some and not others.''
   On Friday, Leenaars will become only the second non-American to
receive the Edwin Shneidman Award, established by a former UCLA
professor to encourage research into suicide. The award will be
presented at a convention of the American Association of
Suicidology in Washington, D.C.
   Eight out of 10 people contemplate suicide, but only those who
cannot bear the pain go through with it, Leenaars said. About 15
percent leave a note, ``the ultimate personal document.''
   With the help of a computer, Leenaars has identified eight
classifications of suicides, based on what people write in their
notes. They range from tunnel vision to paranoia, failed
interpersonal relations and explosive anger turned on themselves.
   Some hurt so bad ``they just want to stop consciousness,'' while
others use suicide to express a bewildering ambivalence about life:
``Not only do they hate, and love, someone but they want to live
and not live.
   ``The common stimulus in all suicides is unbearable
psychological pain,'' said Leenaars, who works with school boards
and public groups on suicide prevention and has written a book,
``Suicide Notes,'' scheduled for August publication.
   Leenaars said a note left by a 75-year-old woman in Los Angeles
made him cry. Before death by suffocation she wrote: ``Martha, I'm
heartsick. First Grandma, then Bill, then my home, my car, my
eyesight, now my apartment ... Love, Mary. Thanks for everything to
everyone.''
   A 13-year-old boy, disappointed in love, left this note before
ending his life: ``I know what I'm doing. Annette, I found out. Ask
Carol. I love you all, Bill.''
   An 18-year-old married man shot himself and told those left
behind: ``Life isn't worth the bother.''
   One note said: ``No one is to blame. P.S. Happy Father's Day.''
   Another man, unable to control his obsessive perfectionism,
killed himself because his Ferrari got scratched, Leenaars said.
   The doctor believes suicides are underreported since many
coroners require a note before making that ruling. Even so,
official rates in North America tripled in the third quarter of
this century with the highest toll in the 18 to 25 age bracket.
   In 1981, there were 12.9 suicides in Canada and 12.7 in the
United States for every 100,000 people.
   The highest rate reported to the United Nations that year was
Romania with 59.9 while Kenya reported 0.2.
   Far more men than women kill themselves. For every 100,000 North
Americans, about 20 men and six women commit suicide. ``It's really
concerning,'' said Leenaars. ``Men may need to be liberated (from)
the macho image.''
   Married with two small children, Leenaars became interested in
the topic after a high school friend whose parents were separated
died in a suspected suicide. ``I felt I didn't understand, I
couldn't help.''
   Most victims give clues beforehand and therapists, families and
workmates can intervene if they recognize the signals, he said.
   ``When people talk, you should listen,'' Leenaars said. ``Watch
out for the person who's always been sad who is suddenly happy. And
suicide threats should always be taken seriously.''

   Cher won the Oscar as best actress Monday
night for her role as a widow who discovers love in ``Moonstruck,''
while ``The Last Emperor,'' a tragic epic of modern China, became
the most-honored film in 26 years with nine awards, including best
picture.
   Michael Douglas was named best actor at the 60th Academy Awards
for his portrayal of a ruthless inside trader in ``Wall Street.''
   Best supporting performers were Olympia Dukakis, as Cher's
outspoken Italian mother coping with a wayward husband in
``Moonstruck,'' and Sean Connery, the hard-fisted, incorruptible
Chicago beat cop in ``The Untouchables.''
   ``When I was a little girl, my mother said, `I really want you
to be something,''' Cher told the cheering crowd at the Shrine
Auditorium. ``... I don't think this means I am somebody, but I
guess I am on my way.'' The actress, known for outlandish fashions
as well as talent, wore a see-through sequined dress that was
somewhat less revealing than her notorious headdress outfit of two
years ago.
   ``Emperor,'' the sweeping story of China's last imperial ruler,
won in all nine categories for which it was nominated by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: best film, best
director for Bernardo Bertolucci, screenplay adaptation, costumes,
original score, art direction, cinematography, sound and editing.
   That gave it more Oscars than any movie since ``West Side
Story'' took home 10 in 1962. ``Ben-Hur'' holds the record for 11
in 1960. In the 1959 awards, the musical ``Gigi'' also swept nine
Oscars out of nine nominations.
   It was a night of few surprises but some awkwardness, with the
shadow of a strike by movie and TV writers falling heavily on the
proceedings. There were numerous references, some joking, some
serious, to the labor dispute, and on several occasions performers
appeared to stumble over their remarks.
   Douglas, who also starred in last year's box-office smash
``Fatal Attraction,'' thanked his father, actor Kirk Douglas, ``for
helping a son step out from his shadow.''
   Douglas' award was presented by Marlee Matlin, a deaf actress
who won last year's Oscar. She has been taking speech lessons, and
after signing her opening remarks she haltingly named all the
nominees to prolonged cheers.
   The actress category had sparked the most interest this year,
with Cher drawing strong competition from Glenn Close in ``Fatal
Attraction'' and Sally Kirkland in ``Anna.'' Also nominated were
Holly Hunter for ``Broadcast News'' and two-time winner Meryl
Streep for ``Ironweed.''
   John Patrick Shanley's script for ``Moonstruck'' won for best
original screenplay, making that film a distant runner-up to
``Emperor'' with three Oscars. Denmark's ``Babette's Feast'' was
best foreign film.
   ``As an Italian, a European, the Academy Awards always seemed
like a distant ceremony: Distant, remote, something I did not
belong to,'' Bertolucci told the audience. He was introduced by
Robin Williams, who jokingly said the academy was offering this
year's winner a ``green card,'' a reference to the fact that none
of the five director nominees was American.
   ``OK, Michael, let's go!'' a jubilant Miss Dukakis whooped after
accepting the gold statuette. The reference was to her cousin,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who is seeking the
Democratic nomination for president.
   Connery, Hollywood's original James Bond, addressed his
acceptance to ``Ladies and gentlemen, friends, a few enemies,'' and
put in a fervent plea for an end to the writers' strike.
   The best original movie song of 1987 was ``The Time of My Life''
from ``Dirty Dancing.''
   The first prize of the night, for best visual effects, went to
``Innerspace,'' a Steven Spielberg-produced fantasy about a test
pilot reduced to microscopic size and accidentally injected into
the body of a grocery clerk.
   The award for best animated short film went to ``The Man Who
Planted Trees.'' ``Young at Heart'' was best documentary short
subject and ``The Ten-Year Lunch: The Wit and Wisdom of the
Algonquin Roundtable'' was best documentary feature. Best live
action short film was ``Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall.'' The
award for makeup went to ``Harry and the Hendersons.''
   More than 1,000 movie fans had packed bleachers hours in advance
to cheer celebrities arriving for the ceremonies, which were
broadcast live by ABC-TV with Chevy Chase as host.

   The move from the Music Center to the Shrine meant far more
limousines than usual pulling up before the six 24-foot Oscars
guarding the auditorium entrance.
   ``Last year at the Music Center we had 3,000 people,'' said
Samuel Goldwyn Jr., producer of the Oscar show for the second year.
``This year we have 6,000.''
   But apparently there wasn't enough room for the Oscarcast
orcestra at the cavernous Shrine. The musicians were housed on a
sound stage five miles away in Hollywood and would offer their
``live'' fanfares and movie themes via phone lines to giant
speakers in the auditorium.
   Producer Goldwyn faced a special problem this year: the strike
by the Writers Guild of America against the motion picture and
television producers. Much of the script had been written before
the strike was called, but the guild refused to grant a waiver for
the work to be completed. The Guild had also warned that
non-members who write for the show might face rejection if they
ever wanted to join the WGA.
   The 60th awards marked a first in press coverage: the U.S.S.R.
was represented. Photographer Nikolai Gnisyuk of the Soviet Screen
magazine (circulation: 2 million) was accredited to join the mass
of media backstage.
   ``We journalists and photographers in the Soviet Union are
amazed that such a fuss is made over these awards,'' said Gnisyuk
before the ceremonies. ``That is, we understand the importance of
the awards to the industry, but all this mania is just incredible.
It's as if someone were running for national election.''
   One major award was already known: Billy Wilder for the Irving
G. Thalberg award for consistent quality of production. Wilder has
already received six Oscars for his work as writer, director and
producer, his films including ``The Lost Weekend,'' ``Sunset
Boulevard,'' ``Some Like It Hot'' and ``The Apartment.''
   Unlike Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford and other filmmakers with
distinctive styles, Wilder's films don't easily fit a pattern.
``I'm just a storyteller,'' Wilder once remarked. ``Technique is
secondary to me.''

   Cher, who first gained fame as the
long-haired singing sidekick to a straight man named Sonny Bono,
took home the best actress Oscar Monday night for her performance
as the superstitious young widow of ``Moonstruck.''
   ``I want to really say something,'' she said, upon accepting the
award. ``When I was little my mother said, `I want you to be
something,' and I guess this represents 23 or 24 years of my work,
and I've never won anything before from my peers. I'm really,
really happy.''
   The actress was dressed in a somewhat less revealing gown than
her sensational headdress and bare-belly contraption of two years
ago. But this year's outfit was far from modest _ a black sequined
gown with see-through netting around the torso that was covered
strategically by a thick black cape.
   As she left her seat to come on stage, the audience stood and
applauded, and Cher was hugged by Olympia Dukakis, who won the best
supporting actress award for playing her mother in ``Moonstruck.''
   Oscar in hand, Cher thanked Meryl Streep, who also had been
nominated for ``Ironweed,'' and Miss Streep, who starred with Cher
in 1983's ``Silkwood,'' answered from the audience by blowing
kisses.
   ``I don't think that this means that I am somebody, but I guess
I'm on my way,'' Cher said in closing. She had been nominated in a
supporting role for ``Silkwood'' but did not win.
   Earlier, Bono, who is seeking election as mayor of Palm Springs
in a Tuesday election, said he was sure Cher would win.
   ``I had this vision,'' Bono said. ``This incredible thought
occurred to me. Cher's going to win the Academy Award. I called her
yesterday. I said, `Cher, you're going to win.' She said, `From
your mouth to God's ear.'''
   It's been 23 years since the bell-bottomed, furry-vested rock
couple hit the top of the record charts singing ``I've Got You
Babe,'' and 14 years since both their television show and marriage
hit the rocks.
   ``Wouldn't it be fun if she won the Academy Award and I was
elected mayor?'' Bono asked.
   Nominated for best actress with Cher and Miss Streep were Holly
Hunter for ``Broadcast News,'' Sally Kirkland for ``Anna'' and
Glenn Close, ``Fatal Attraction.''

<TEXT>
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch has decided whom
he will endorse for president _ either Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
or Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis _ but says he won't reveal
his decision until the end of the week.
   ``I want to keep you thinking about it,'' he twitted reporters
on Monday at the Mayflower Hotel, where he was presenting awards
for urban economic development at a luncheon.
   ``I already made up my mind,'' he said. ``I'm not going to
announce it 'til the end of the week.''
   Koch had been pushing for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo as the
Democratic nominee who would emerge from a deadlocked national
convention. But Cuomo said during the weekend that he will not
accept a draft, freeing Koch to endorse someone else.
   The mayor said he was disappointed at Cuomo's announcement, but
added, ``I believe the impact is nobody is waiting for the other
shoe to fall.''
   The outspoken mayor repeated his reasons for opposing the
candidacy of Jesse Jackson, including his position on the Middle
East and spending programs which Koch says would bankrupt the
nation.

<HEAD>Texas' Hightower Stumps Upstate New York for Jesse Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas' populist and popular commissioner of
agriculture went to upstate New York to reassure farmers and other
rural New Yorkers about voting for Jesse Jackson in the state's
April 19 presidential primary.
   ``I bring some comfort factor to farmers who instinctively want
to support Jackson but want to hear it from somewhere in the family
that this is an OK thing to do,'' said Jim Hightower as he began
his tour Monday.
   ``Jesse Jackson has the single best farm program of any of the
candidates,'' said Hightower, who called himself the first white
state official to endorse Jackson for president.
   Hightower's help in upstate New York is ``of enormous value'' to
the Jackson campaign, said Assemblyman Arthur Eve, a Buffalo
Democrat who is chairman of Jackson's upstate campaign.
   ``People know him in the rural areas. They know of his
committment to very progressive agriculture policy,'' said Eve. ``I
think he can help us win New York. ... This election is going to be
won upstate.''
   Upstate New York traditionally accounts for about 25 percent of
the presidential primary day ballot. About 60 percent of the votes
statewide will be cast in New York City and 15 percent in the
city's suburbs.

<HEAD>Campbell Aides: Governor To Play Role At Republican Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Carroll Campbell, Southern chairman
for Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign, is likely
to play a highly visible role at the Republican National
Convention, according to a published report.
   A member of Campbell's administration said during the weekend
that Campbell is likely to either nominate Bush or make one of the
three seconding speeches, The Greenville News said in Monday's
editions.
   ``It's going to be one of those,'' said the administration
official who asked not to be identified.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's national campaign chairman and Campbell's
former campaign manager, said he didn't want to discuss the
Republican governor's specific role at the national convention in
New Orleans Aug. 15-18. ``But he'll have one,'' Atwater told the
newspaper.
   Campbell, who is both personally and politically close to Bush,
also is considered a long-shot vice presidential possibility, but
Campbell has said he doesn't believe he will be chosen.
   Making a nominating or seconding speech would enhance the
prestige of the governor, who is expected to run for re-election
beginning in 1990 and is widely perceived as having Senate
aspirations, the News said.
   Bush has all but locked up the GOP nomination with only Pat
Robertson retaining some delegate commitments and an organization,
mainly to influence platform and party direction and to build for a
1992 presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
   A community activist who founded a city youth
center and has been a foster parent to 21 children was charged with
sexually assaulting two teen-age boys in his care, authorities said.
   A grand jury on Monday indicted the Rev. Paul J. Hall, 41, of
suburban South Holland, on 16 counts of criminal sexual assault and
eight counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.
   Hall surrendered late Monday and was released after posting 10
percent of a $25,000 bond, said South Holland police spokeswoman
Georgianna Musket.
   He will plead innocent to the charges, said his attorney, Brent
Stratton.
   Hall, a non-denominational clergyman, attracted widespread
attention through food giveaways and other community programs run
out of a storefront headquarters on Chicago's South Side. Since
beginning the giveaways in 1980, he has kept a 25-day fast each
Christmas.
   The assaults on the two boys, now ages 15 and 16, occurred from
mid-1986 through last fall, when Hall was a foster parent to six
children at his home, said Cook County State's Attorney Richard M.
Daley.
   ``The evidence clearly shows that the Reverend Hall betrayed the
trust of these two children,'' Daley said.
   In January, South Holland Police Chief Dennis Smits said Hall
had called Chicago police to report that a 15-year-old foster child
had run away.
   The teen-ager, found at O'Hare International Airport, made
allegations of abuse, Smits said. The six children living with Hall
were removed from his supervision.
   Hall has been a foster parent for the state Department of
Children and Family Services since 1979 and has cared for 21 foster
children, said department spokeswoman Jo Warfield.
   The agency had received no complaints about Hall before, said
Robert Moore, chief of internal investigations for the agency.
   ``How did he slip through the cracks? If we knew that, we could
solve the problem,'' said Moore. ``You can't just stop every act.
We continue to look at and review what went wrong and hope we can
close up that crack.''
   Hall founded the Paul Hall Boys Club in the 1960s. He later
branched out into other youth-oriented programs, such as a 24-hour
hotline for gang members seeking to go straight.
   Hall also established drop-off centers for gang members who
wanted to turn in weapons.
   Daley said the charges are not connected to Hall's youth center,
which admits girls and boys. The club is not associated with the
Boys & Girls Club of Chicago or its national affiliate, the Boys
Clubs of America.
   Daley said allegations concerning other children in Hall's care
are being investigated. Ms. Warfield said her agency is taking
steps to lift Hall's license to be a foster parent.
   Hall is to be arraigned May 2. If convicted of all the charges,
he could be sentenced to 296 years in prison.

   Newspaper editor John Kakooza appeared in
Kampala Magistrate's Court on sedition charges, while three other

be arrested.
   Kakooza, 32, is accused of writing and publishing a seditious
article in the English-language weekly on March 16. It criticized
police for a yearlong delay in bringing to trial five men charged
with the murder of former government minister Andrew Lutakome
Kayiira.
   The suspects were arrested 18 days after Kayiira was shot in a
Kampala house March 6, 1987. Police say they were robbing the house.
   Chief Magistrate Constance Byamugisha on Monday refused to hear
Kakooza's case because the charge sheet was not signed by the
public prosecution director. Kakooza, who was arrested last week,
was held in custody.
   A journalist at his newspaper, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said managing director Michael Kagguua; assistant editor
Joseph Kiggundu; and John Kyeyune, production and circulation
manager, went into hiding over the weekend.

   The rightist party that won
last month's legislative elections has filed a request for a vote
recount in La Union, the country's easternmost province.
   The Central Elections Council last week announced that the
rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, had won 30 of
60 seats in the unicameral legislature in nationwide elections held
March 20.
   All 60 seats in the Assembly were decided, as well as municipal
authorities in 262 towns and cities. The council said the incumbent
Christian Democratic Party won 23 Assembly seats and the National
Conciliation Party won seven.
   Arena, which won 178 of the municipalities, claimed it also
gained an outright majority in the Assembly. It charged the
Christian Democrats with trying to ``steal'' a deputy in La Union.
   Preliminary results from the province indicated Arena had taken
two of three deputy seats. But final results released by the
council gave only one to Arena and two to the Christian Democrats.
   Arena filed its request for a recount on Monday. The council has
until Wednesday to decided whether to grant or reject the request.

<HEAD>Draft Letter Suggests Flexibility On Birth Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A draft letter on women written by U.S. Roman
Catholic bishops suggests that the church be more responsive toward
the large numbers of Catholic women who practice artificial
contraception despite a church ban.
   The letter, released Monday, reasserted church teachings that
birth control by artificial means is wrong. But it also said, ``It
is essential that we foster a dialogue between those who find
prohibitions against artificial contraception unacceptable and
those who find that the natural regulation of births has enriched
and preserved their marriage.''
   The 164-page letter breaks little new ground on women's role in
the church but does condemn sexism and urges priests to be more
sensitive to women's concerns.
   The document recommended that women play more of a leadership
role in the church and suggests further study of the possibility of
installing women as permanent deacons.
   It also said girls should be allowed to join altar boys in
assisting priests, saying that exclusion of girls seems ``to stand
in contradiction to our call for women's more direct involvement in
the life of the church.''
   However, the bishops stopped short of recommending that women be
ordained as priests.
   On birth control, the draft acknowledged that ``there is a wide
gap between what the church teaches about artificial contraception
and the actual practice of many Catholic women.''
   ``Consulting with women on matters pertaining to birth control
will contribute to church teaching on sexuality,'' the draft said.
``Women's experience will lead to the formulation of better
policies and preparation for family planning that can be more
widely communicated to engaged and married couples.
   ``We especially encourage a spirit of compassion towards those
who in good conscience who have not lived in accord with the ideals
set forth by the church.''
   The draft of the pastoral letter, titled ``Partners in the
Mystery of Redemption, A Pastoral Response to Women's Concerns for
Church and Society,'' will be circulated among Catholics in the
United States, with responses due Dec. 1.
   A final draft is expected to be presented to the full body of
U.S. bishops in November 1989 and, if approved, would become part
of Catholic teachings. The draft was issued more than five years
after church authorities began a study of women in the church.
   Mary Brabeck, associate professor of educational psychology at
Boston College, who helped prepare the draft letter, said she
thought the significance of the document was that ``women are being
listened to, their experiences are being listened to.''
   Sister Sara Butler of the Missionary Servants of the Most
Blessed Trinity in Philadelphia, said that the letter was
``definitely trying to address male attitudes, and particularly
male clerical attitudes.''
   The pastoral letter, in fact, chastises some priests and
counselors in the church who fail to show understanding for
divorced women.
   ``Some of us as well as priests, religious and laity need to
overcome the fear or prejudice that causes them to shun those whose
marriages have led to divorce or ended in annulment,'' the letter
said.
   At another point, the letter said: ``A frequently voiced concern
is that those to whom women turn for help do not have the training,
sensitivity or experience necessary to address concretely what it
is like to be a mother, pursue a career, seek just wages and be
vigilant in regard to sexual violence.''

<HEAD>``The Last Emperor'' Sweeps Nine of Nine Nominations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As expected, ``The Last Emperor'' swept the
60th Academy Awards ceremony Monday night, taking Oscars in each of
its nine nominated categories including direction and Best Picture.
   ``I must give a Chinese kow-tow to the Academy. This is one of
the strongest emotions of my life, and I can't hide it,'' said
Bernardo Bertolucci, who directed the epic about China's boy ruler
Pu Yi.
   Bertolucci took the Oscar for best director, the first Italian
director to win in this category. The film also won for art
direction, cinematography, sound, film editing, original score,
costume design, adapted screenplay and picture.
   It was the most Oscars won by a single movie since 1962, when
``West Side Story'' took 10 awards. The record is held by the 1959
``Ben-Hur,'' which won 11.
   Producer Jeremy Thomas accepted the best picture award saying,
``I must say this is certainly an imperial evening for me.''
   Bertolucci thanked China for allowing him to shoot there. The
director amazed the film industry by winning permission to shoot a
movie with political overtones in China and to take cameras into
the fabled Forbidden City, the shrine of Chinese history.
   The logistics of the film's production included actors from six
nations, and 19,000 extras who played the soldiers of the People's
Liberation Army.
   It was Bertolucci's second nomination for directing, the first
being for ``Last Tango in Paris'' in 1973. He also received a
writing nomination for his screenplay of ``The Conformist'' in 1971.
   ``As an Italian, a European, the Acadeny Awards always seemed
like a distant ceremony: Distant, remote, something I did not
belong to,'' Bertolucci told the Shrine Auditorium audience.
   ``Then one day ``The Last Emperor'' got nine nominations and
everything changed immediately,'' he said.
   Asked backstage about the lack of acting nominations for the
picture, Bertolucci said, ``This is a democratic election, so what
can I say?''

<HEAD>Maryland Legislature Approves Saturday Night Special Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STUCKEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first state law in the nation to ban
the sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials cleared
the General Assembly and was sent to the governor, who has promised
to sign it.
   Despite a fierce lobbying effort by the National Rifle
Association, the bill was passed Monday night with support from top
state officials and Sarah Brady, wife of James Brady, President
Reagan's press secretary.
   Mrs. Brady told legislators at an earlier hearing that a $29
handgun that would be banned under the Maryland law was used by
John Hinckley in his 1981 assassination attempt that wounded the
president and left husband partially disabled.
   Democratic House Speaker R. Clayton Mitchell said the 95-41 vote
in the House of Delegates a few hours before the 1988 legislative
session ended ``seems to be a first, a giant step forward.''
   ``I'm hoping Congress will look at what Maryland did,'' said
Attorney General J. Joseph Curran.``That's where this action is
needed.
   ``It's been a long time but unfortunately it seems like as the
list of victims grows'' it becomes easier to pass gun control
legislation, he said.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who helped move the bill through
the legislature, said he will sign it into law unless he finds some
unexpected legal flaws.
   NRA lobbyists gave up their fight after watching the bill sail
through the Senate on a 35-10 vote Saturday, but Charles H.
Cunningham, state liaison for the association, said he will be back
to renew the fight next year.
   ``I just hope it's not a trend-setting thing where a lot of
states start setting up boards,'' Cunningham said after the Senate
vote.
   The bill directs the governor to create a state Handgun Roster
Board headed by the state police superintendent. The nine-member
board will prepare a list of guns that can be sold in Maryland and
will be required to withhold approval of:
   _Guns that are inaccurate, poorly made, easily concealed and
manufactured of cheap materials, characteristics common to the
Saturday Night Specials said to be used by drug pushers and other
small-time criminals.
   _Guns made mostly of plastic or ceramic materials that can't be
readily detected by security systems at airports and public
buildings.
   _Guns in which the manufacturer's serial number has been
obliterated or altered.
   The bill prohibits manufacturers, dealers and private
individuals from selling any guns not on the list, and provides
fines from $2,500 to $10,000 for violations. It will only be
illegal to sell the weapons, not to own them.
   ``We shifted the burden of proof. We put the onus on gun
merchants to justify their guns,'' said state Sen. Howard Denis,
Republican.
   Four states, Illinois, Hawaii, South Carolina and Minnesota,
have laws that ban guns based on the melting point of the metal,
according to the lobbying group Handgun Control Inc. Guns with
lower melting points are of poorer quality and thus cheaper.
   However, both the NRA and Handgun Control agreed that no state
has a law regulating guns on the basis of inaccuracy, ease of
concealment, plastic or ceramic construction or the other
characteristics addressed by the Maryland law.
   ``Clearly, this is going to add some impetus to other states
considering gun control laws. This is an example we'll be taking to
other states,'' said Michael Beard, executive director of the
National Coalition to Ban Handguns.
   The ban on sale of Saturday Night Specials won't take effect
until Jan. 1, 1990. The board will be required to prepare a list of
approved guns by July 1, 1989.

   Here is the conclusion of the draft pastoral
letter on women issued Monday by U.S. Roman Catholic bishops.
   
   I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved
you, so you also should love one another. This is how all will know
that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another (Jn.
13:34-35).
   Today is a time of challenge and change for men and women. Each
day more barriers to the full recognition of their equality before
God fall, more stereotypes crumble, more doors open.
   Women value the church's recognition that they are a vital force
in the world. They embrace the expanded roles open to them since
Vatican Council II. They bring knowledge, education, skills, and
leadership to both society and the church.
   For Catholic women the church is home. It is through the church
that they worship God, serve others, and seek guidelines for how to
live in society in keeping with the full dignity of their calling
to be persons and partners, to be the people of God, in an unjust
and imperfect world.
   Like Mary, women refuse to lose courage; they will not give up
hope. They believe in the basic thrust of our heritage which holds
that we are to ``preserve the unity of the spirit through the bond
of peace: One body and one Spirit, ... one Lord, one faith, one
baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all
and in all'' (Eph. 4:3-5).

<TEXT>
   To be faithful to our heritage scripturally and doctrinally
means to respect the dignity of each human person, male and female.
To follow Jesus means to be committed to living out just
relationships in the church and in the world. To become the kind of
church God invites us to be means to work in solidarity with the
poor, the rich, the sinners, with persons of distinction.
   The mystery of partnership in the church is manifest in our
baptismal call to faith and holiness as part of the little flock of
Christ (cf. Lk. 12:32). To live in Christ is the invitation all
receive (cf. Gal. 3:28); to belong to Christ is the central reality
in life (cf. Ph. 3:7-14); to refuse this vocation as coming from
God is the most obstinate sin (cf. Gn. 3).
   The call to partnership in the church is thus fundamental to our
entire heritage. We believe, therefore, that the cooperative
mutuality of women and men by virtue of their baptism will more and
more become a reality as our understanding of the grace and
benefits of partnership grows. Only then can we be freed from the
attitudes of fear, anger, and violence that divide and destrroy the
Christian community where all are challenged to abide in love (cf.
1 Jn. 7-12).

   Jesus enjoyed caring relationships with women. He healed their
physical afflictions (Mk. 7:24-30). He was compassionate towards
the widow of Naim and restored her son to life (Lk. 7:11f.) He
responded to the tears of Martha and Mary when he raised Lazarus
from the dead (Jn. 11:1f.) He described God as being like a woman
who persists until she finds what was lost, saying, ``Rejoice with
me'' (Lk. 15:8-10).
   Women ministered to and served with Jesus throughout his life.
Mary of Nazareth accepted a new direction in her life in response
to the divine call (Lk. 1:38); she risked social censure to do
God's will. Mary of Bethany, a disciple, listening to Jesus with
rapt attention, was said to have chosen the better part (Lk.
10:38-42).
   Other women ministered with Jesus in his daily work of
evangelizing and teaching (Lk. 8:2-3). Mary Magdalene and Mary, his
mother, remained by him at the cross and anointed his body after
death (Mk. 15:16). Women were discoverers of the empty tomb and
first witnesses of the resurrection (Mt. 28:7).
   They, too, received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Ac. 1:14);
came to the faith eagerly with men (Ac. 5:14f), and provided homes
for the breaking of the bread (Rm. 16:3; 1 Cor. 16:19). Women
prophesied (Ac. 21:9) and taught others about Jesus (Ac. 18:26).
Likewise they were persecuted and jailed with the men (Ac. 8:3).
Women were and are disciples in the truest sense.

<BYLINE>Called to Emulate Mary</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary stands as a model for all Christians of what it means to be
a partner with God in the work of salvation. In God's plan, Mary's
free consent was involved in accomplishing the mystery of the
Incarnation. When Mary said ``Yes,'' the Word was made flesh by the
power of God's Spirit.
   In her response of faith, Mary is the perfect model of a
disciple who ``builds up the earthly and temporal city while being
a diligent pilgrim towards the heavenly and eternal city, the
disciple who works for that justice which sets free the oppressed
and for that charity which assists the needy. ... Women and men
alike are called to emulate Mary, to imitate her charity and spirit
of service. Like her, all are called to hear the word of God and
act on it (Lk. 11:28).
   Over and above this, Mary is a special symbol for women, for
only a woman was God's partner in the Incarnation. God ``entrusted
himself to ... the free and active ministry of a woman,'' giving to
Mary the Word incarnate.
   God's plan required the cooperation of a human mother who would
conceive, carry, bear, and nurse this Child; a mother who would
give the Word real flesh and real blood, a human family and an
earthly dwelling place. Jesus, the Incarnate Word, belongs to our
race, by the power of the Holy Spirit, because of and through Mary.
As Mother of Christ, she is also the mother of the church, who sums
up in herself all that the church is.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, in his encyclical, Redemptoris Mater, affirms
that ``women, by looking at Mary, find in her the secret of living
their feminity with dignity and of achieving their own true
advancement.
   Mary keeps before the church the virtues women are known for:
``the self-offering totality of love; the strength that is capable
of bearing the greatest sorrows; limitless fidelity and tireless
devotion to work; the ability to combine penetrating intuition with
words of support and encouragement.''
   In our times, there is a desire on the part of many to revise
devotional representations that appear to propose Mary as a
paradigm of passivity and submission to male authority, a woman
valued chiefly for her virginity and maternity, a woman confined to
domestic and familial roles.
   Similarly, some lament the fact that Mary has often been
presented as so uniquely exalted and gifted, because of her
privileges of grace, that she is beyond emulation. Such images do
not reflect the gains women have made in terms of equality and
co-responsibility.
   In the face of these concerns, we are reminded by the church
that Mary is a woman whose decision led to an event of world
importance; a woman of courage who fearlessly entered into God's
plan and who followed her Son to the cross; a woman who did not
hesitate to challenge injustice, announcing the downfall of the
powerful and the vindication of the oppressed.
   Contemporary portraits celebrate Mary's bond with ordinary women
and reflect on her condition as wife, mother, widow; as refugee and
displaced person; as woman of an oppressed people; as mother of a
prisoner and victim of persecution. Mary is thus not only a model
to emulate but an ``active presence in the life of the Church.''
   As the first disciple, a woman who entered into partnership with
God in the fullest sense, Mary is a sign of hope to all who seek
reconciliation with God and with one another.

<BYLINE>Called to Welcome Women's Gifts</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Women not only continue to carry the bulk of everyday work in
the parish; they are also renewing the church's traditions of
feminine spirituality as a source of inspiration and growth. Women
of scripture and recognized saints are important in their personal
and spiritual renewal.
   Inspiration comes from myriad unnamed women ministering in
homes, parishes, and communities, engaged in numerous charitable
works, living contemplatively, loving God, and listening obediently
to the promptings of the Spirit.
   Women who love and serve the church call the church in turn to
be more responsive to their requests to be involved to a much
greater degree in the decisions that most affect their lives in the
ecclesial community.
   While we affirm that the church is neither a democracy nor a
political organization, we urge that every effort be made to
implement legislation that encourages such involvement, to appoint
more women in administrative positions, and in general to create an
atmosphere in the church that welcomes women's gifts at every level
of participation.
   With this kind of cooperation, the church will certainly go
forward in its mission to enable women and men to be partners in
the mystery of redemption.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Called to Implement Our Recommendations</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Having written these words, we must see to it that the church,
on the national, diocesan and parochial level, enables this letter
to come to life. The dialogue between women and men must continue
to be expanded so that our recommendations become part of the
living heritage of our Catholic people and our institutions.
   Implementation is essential, for ours must not be a counterfeit
love of formal politeness, impersonal tolerance or empty words.
Like Christ, we must listen first to the will of God speaking in
the deepest recesses of our hearts.
   Thus having heard the word, we must respond with imagination and
courage to eradicate the injustice which keeps us from the full
stature of Christ. We see in this pastoral response only a
beginning, a reminder of ideals, a contact with experience and
reality yielding throughtful reflections and calls for action.
   Together we wait expectantly in hope for a tomorrow in which
love will truly prevail, in which, with Mary, we can confidently
pray from our hearts:
   My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord:
   My spirit rejoices in God my Savior
   For you, Lord, have looked with favor on your lowly servant
   From this day all generations will call me blessed:
   You, the Almighty, have done great things for me
   And holy is your name.
   You have mercy on those who fear you,
   From generation to generation.
   You have shown strength with your arm
   And scattered the proud in their conceit,
   Casting down the mighty from their thrones
   And lifting up the lowly.
   You have filled the hungry with good things
   And sent the rich away empty.
   You have come to the aid of your servant Israel,
   To remember the promise of mercy,
   The promise made to our forebears,
   To Abraham and his children for ever.

<TEXT>
   ``Babette's Feast,'' a Danish movie about two
pious, unmarried sisters who take a political refugee into their
home, won best foreign language film at the Academy Awards.
   ``It's the first time a Danish movie can take an Oscar home,''
director Gabriel Axel, who spent 14 years trying to get the movie
made, said as he accepted the award Monday night.
   ``I am very grateful for this honor and I want to thank you
Academy members from the bottom of my heart.''
   Also nominated were ``Au Revoir Les Enfants,'' France; ``Course
Completed,'' Spain; ``The Family,'' Italy, and ``Pathfinder,''
Norway.
   Axel has divided his career between his native Denmark and
France.
   ``Babette's Feast'' portrayed the lives of the sisters who took
in a political refugee named Babette (Stephane Audran) fleeing the
French revolution.
   The refugee, a former world-class chef, later repays their
kindness by devoting her winnings from a lottery to creation of a
sumptuous feast.
   The film, titled ``Babettes Gaestebud'' in Denmark, was based on
a short story by Isak Dinesen, whose book ``Out of Africa'' was the
basis for the 1986 best movie Oscar winner.
   Following his success with ``Babette's Feast,'' Axel has said he
hopes to film a project he has nurtured for 20 years _ a version of
``Hamlet'' based on the earliest histories of the saga from which
Shakespeare borrowed his plot.
   Thirty countries submitted movies for consideration as best
foreign film for this year's Academy Awards ceremony. The record
for foreign submissions was 32 in 1984, according to Bob Werden, an
Academy spokesman.

   Twenty-seven people who attended a dinner
following a funeral in northeastern China came down with food
poisoning and 14 of them died, the official China Daily reported
today.
   The 13 others became seriously ill after the dinner last week in
Yixian County, according to the report.
   The dinner was held by Yu Huqing, head of the gardening
department of Jinzhou City in Yixian County following the death of
his mother, the newspaper said. The report did not say if Yu was
among those who died.

   It's amazing that despite a writers' strike
the Academy Awards could still be so gaseous and wordy.
   Everybody talked nonstop during Monday night's 60th annual
Oscars ceremony on ABC: the host, the presenters, and especially
the winners.
   There were frequent references to the strike by the Writers
Guild of America, and to the fact that some people had no scripts.
It didn't slow anyone down, however. The winners seemed to have
carte blanche to blab on until there was no one left to thank.
   Even master storyteller Billy Wilder, in accepting the Irving
Thalberg Award for lifetime achievement, rambled before making a
poignant statement about his permanent entry into this country.
   It was an awards show that offered few surprises. Every front
runner won as expected. The only suspense was whether ``The Last
Emperor'' would win in all nine nominated categories. It did.
   The biggest thrill was seeing Cher win as best actress for
``Moonstruck.'' Cher, like Sally Field before her, has come a long
way after a start in music and television that gave little hint of
her talent.
   The awards show, as it has in recent years, got off to a fast,
promising start. The opening number with the dancing gold Oscars
was original and rousing. Host Chevy Chase set an irreverent tone
when he addressed the audience: ``Good evening, Hollywood phonies.''
   The presentation of the animated shorts award by Mickey Mouse,
with an assist from Tom Selleck, was an inspired piece of casting.
   Last year's most eloquent winner, Marlee Matlin of ``Children of
a Lesser God,'' stole the show again. The hearing-impaired actress
spoke as she announced the nominees for best actor and named
Michael Douglas as the winner.
   Robin Williams, a nominee for best actor and presenter of the
Oscar for best director, also stole the show in his own inimitable
way. He was very funny, and when he uttered a phrase that could
have gotten on the air only on a live show he chortled at his own
naughtiness. ``The phones are lighting up, folks,'' he said. ``The
number is 1-800-Robin.''
   Bernardo Bertolucci won as best director for ``The Last
Emperor.'' When he returned later to accept another award as
co-writer of the screenplay he explained that the guards wouldn't
let him back into the auditorium until he displayed his Oscar.
   The show, scheduled to run three hours, ran slightly more than
3{ hours. Not quite a record, but wearily close.

<HEAD>Merger Of Rivals Brings Virtual One-Party State To Zimbabwe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>AP News Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The merger of two black political groups
that led the war to end white-minority rule in Zimbabwe, then
Rhodesia, virtually abolishes one of Africa's few multiparty states.
   ``We have one Zimbabwe, one nation and one national army. We
will be stronger if we have one party,'' President Robert Mugabe
said at a weekend rally.
   Mugabe, an avowed Marxist, led his party to victory in elections
held after a British-sponsored peace conference ended years of
guerrilla warfare and Zimbabwe became independent in April 1980.
   His chief rival in the balloting was Joseph Nkomo, one of the
country's wealthiest men. They had organized guerrilla armies in
the 1960s to gain black-majority rule and toward the end of the
campaign joined forces. But the alliance collapsed in 1980, after
Mugabe's resounding victory and scattered clashes followed between
the supporters of both sides.
   Mugabe, head of the Zimbabwe African National Union, advocated
one-party rule and was opposed by Nkomo and his Zimbabwe African
Peoples Union.
   But last week, a Peoples Union convention endorsed a merger
approved in December by Mugabe and Nkomo. On Saturday, National
Union conference delegates approved the agreement.
   It is expected that by the end of the year, Mugabe's party will
be by law the sole political party in this southern African nation.
   Opponents say Mugabe's party will turn capitalist Zimbabwe into
a socialist state with Parliament becoming a rubber-stamp
legislature.
   Supporters claim the merger will bring unity to an area divided
by tribal differences and with political structures too fragile to
withstand the rigors of Western-style multiparty politics.
   The merger does not basically expand Mugabe's solid power base.
He has been in control since his party won 57 of Parliament's 100
seats in pre-independence elections and has increased the number
the number since then to 85.
   But the merger will give him the support to revise the
British-drafted constitution that dictated a multiparty system for
the first 10 years after independence. The constitution can be
changed during that period only by a unanimous parliemtary vote.
   The new united party will control all but one legislative seat.
   A businessman, Goodson Sithole, is the only representative of a
small party that broke from the National Union.
   He could block the one-party move with a negative vote, but
isn't expected to stand up against the combined weight of the two
main parties.
   For Mugabe, 64, his goal of creating a Marxist-Leninist state
has involved more rhetoric then reality in his eight years in
power. Zimbabwe remains one of Africa's staunchest capitalist
countries and whites, internally and externally, still control the
economy.
   But Mugabe has made it clear he expects the country's leaders to
be socialists.
   ``Surely, they (his opponents) cannot be allowed to walk our
public path of socialism with us, when at the same time they have
charted for themselves their own private path of capitalism,'' he
said at the convention on Saturday.
   For 70-year-old Nkomo the merger is a chance for the ``old
lion,'' as his supporters call him, to leave the political scene
with some of his former glory.
   Nkomo had been dumped from a coalition government shortly after
the 1980 elections. But when the merger plans were announced in
December after three years of negotiations, he became one of three
senior ministers in the Cabinet. In the new united party he will be
second vice-president _ the No. 3 slot.

   Omerta _ the Mafia code of silence _ is
crumbling as authorities find it easier to turn mobsters into
witnesses, according to top law enforcement officials and a former
member of the Sicilian Mafia.
   ``When the going gets tough, the smart change sides,'' John C.
Keeney, acting chief of the Justice Department's Criminal Division,
told a Senate subcommittee on Monday. ``The number and stature of
convicted mobsters `flipping' to the government's side in recent
years is unprecedented.''
   Before Keeney testified at the most extensive Senate organized
crime hearings in a quarter-century, former Sicilian mobster
Tommaso Buscetta helped prove Keeney's point.
   Shielded by a screen to protect the public from seeing him,
Buscetta said the Mafia in Italy has changed so drastically because
of the drug trade that ``I no longer feel bound by the code of
`omerta.'''
   He testified before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, which held dramatic hearings on organized crime a
quarter-century ago. The chief witness then was Joseph Valachi, who
told the panel the inner workings of La Cosa Nostra.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said he will hold three more hearings, so
the panel can assess the state of organized crime 25 years after
Valachi's testimony.
   Monday's most dramatic testimony came from Buscetta, who spoke
in Italian and had his words translated for the committee. Buscetta
has testified previously for the U.S. and Italian governments and
helped convict nearly 500 mobsters, most in Italy, Nunn said.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions, two of his top aides, and
Keeney all told the senators that law enforcement officials have
severely damaged organized crime _ in part through new statutes and
partly because the code of silence is now often broken. Buscetta
gave some insight on why this has happened.
   ``Over the years, I have seen our organization change from
within,'' Buscetta testified. ``I have seen money, drugs, and greed
corrupt and destroy the Cosa Nostra code of honor and loyalty to
the families.
   ``I began to realize that drugs had changed everything, the
family loyalties and codes of respect that I had known as a Mafioso
were quickly becoming things of the past.''
   Sessions testified: ``Omerta ... has been broken in recent
years. The FBI has not only secured the cooperation and testimony
of numerous individuals who have been utilized by the LCN (La Cosa
Nostra) to promote their criminal activities but has elicited the
cooperation of four LCN members whose knowledge and testimony ...
has enabled the FBI to expand the attack on this national criminal
enterprise.''
   He identified the four as Aladena Frattiano, the former acting
boss of the Los Angeles LCN family; Angelo Lonardo, the former
underboss of the Cleveland organized crime family; and Thomas Del
Giorno and Nicholas Caramandi, a capo (lieutenant) and soldier
respectively in the Philadelphia family.
   FBI executive assistant director Oliver B. Revell III said Mafia
families in the United States have not taken over the drug trade,
although individual organized-crime members are involved with
narcotics.
   ``There's a change in LCN membership,'' said Anthony E. Daniels,
deputy assistant FBI director in the criminal investigative
division. ``Where there is money to be made, members of LCN will
become involved in anything.''
   Revell also told the committee that the FBI believes it knows
who is responsible for the disappearance of former Teamsters union
head Jimmy Hoffa on July 30, 1975.
   Revell did not name them, but said they are in prison on other
charges. Revell said he doubted there would be enough evidence to
bring them to trial.
   The FBI on earlier occasions has asserted that it believed it
knew who killed Hoffa. An FBI memo suggested Hoffa's disappearance
was linked to Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano, a former New Jersey
Teamsters boss and reputed organized crime captain imprisoned on a
racketeering conviction. Provenzano has denied he was involved.

   James E. Olson, chairman and chief executive of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., has relinquished his duties
temporarily following major surgery for removal of a malignant
tumor, a newspaper reported today.
   Olson, 62, underwent surgery March 25 for removal of a tumor,
The New York Times quoted an unidentified AT&T spokesman as saying.
The tumor was malignant and Olson is undergoing chemotherapy as an
outpatient, the spokesman said.
   Robert E. Allen, AT&T's president and chief operating officer,
has taken charge.
   The spokesman said it was too soon to determine how long Olson
would need to recover.
   Olson, a 44-year employee with the telecommunications giant, has
served as its chairman and chief executive since 1986.
   He began his career cleaning dirt from telephone manholes and
eventually rose through several management jobs at other Bell
companies before becoming president of Illinois Bell. He moved to
AT&T headquarters in 1977.

effort to harvest organs for transplants from infants born with
most of their brains missing, as doctors took the sixth such baby
off life support.
   Ten-day-old Hope Lovette Mount, of Knoxville, Tenn., was removed
from life support Monday and will be allowed to die, spokesman Dick
Schafer said by telephone from Loma Linda University Medical
Center, 60 miles east of Los Angeles.
   Schaefer said that while Loma Linda plans to maintain five to
seven more anencephalic babies on life support so they can be used
as organ donors, the hospital won't do so until it modifies its
existing guidelines for use of such infants, who are born with most
of their brains missing.
   The review will be completed within two weeks, he said, refusing
to elaborate on the planned changes.
   Loma Linda's program was aimed at maintaining anencephalic
babies on respirators for seven days or until they were declared
brain-dead, whichever came first. Anencephalic babies inevitably
die within days to weeks.
   The idea was to maintain them on life support so their organs
wouldn't deteriorate as they died. The seven-day limit was
established to counter criticism that the doomed babies were being
kept alive _ and suffering _ indefinitely merely to save the lives
of other babies needing donated organs.
   A Southern California infant identified only as Baby John was
the only one of the six anencephalic babies maintained on life
support at Loma Linda to be declared brain-dead within the
seven-day limit. But a suitable recipient for his heart and other
organs could not be found.
   None of the five others were suitable for donations of major
organs, although heart valves and corneas were transplanted from
some of them.
   Loma Linda surgeons did transplant an anencephalic's heart into
Paul Holc, the son of a British Columbia couple, last Oct. 16. But
that heart came from a baby girl who was maintained on life support
in London, Ontario, not at Loma Linda.
   Paul, who received his new heart three hours after his birth by
Caesarean section, was the world's youngest transplant recipient.
He has been released from the hospital and physicians said recently
he was doing well.
   Loma Linda triggered a major medical controversy in 1984 when
Dr. Leonard Bailey implanted a baboon's heart in a girl known as
Baby Fae, who was born with a fatally underdeveloped heart and died
20{ days after the transplant. Since then, the hospital turned
toward anencephalic babies as possible organ donors for infants
with fatal heart defects.

   A fire that killed seven members of a
family was blamed on a 49-year-old man whose proposal to marry the
family's 22-year-old daughter was turned down, police said today.
   The suspect, Muthaswamy Krishnan, was turned over to police by
neighbors who said he poured gasoline on the Sinathambi's home in
Kotagala village and set it ablaze, police Sgt. Nihal Muttabanda
said by telephone from the village.
   He said witnesses in the tea plantation village 55 miles east of
Colombo told him Krishnan was angry when he was rejected as a
suitor by the family's daughter, Padmini, and learned she was to
marry another man.
   Padmini, her father, mother and four brothers died in the blaze
on Monday, Muttabanda said.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American television viewers welcome the
improved picture quality of high-resolution television but are
unwilling to pay a premium for it, according to initial audience
testing studies.
   One study presented Monday at the National Association of
Broadcasters convention here found that viewers usually preferred
the clear and more brilliant picture produced by experimental
high-definition TV (HDTV), though the perceived improvement over
conventional TV was subtle when watched on the size of sets found
in most American homes.
   Screens would have to be two to three times larger to have a
significant impact, it concluded.
   ``There will be HDTV. Most viewers most of the time prefer HDTV
(to conventional TV),'' said W. Russell Neuman, associate professor
at the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, who conducted the study. ``But with the wrong price and
the wrong programming and at the wrong time, HDTV could fail.''
   Audience research conducted by Home Box Office, which provides
programming to cable TV systems, shows that viewers, particularly
young men, prefer the improved-quality picture of HDTV but were
resistant to paying significantly more for it.
   ``Consumers are going to have to be aggressively marketed and
the price will have to be close to the price for existing TVs,''
said Robert Maxwell, HBO vice president for research.
   Maxwell said the company's testing found that viewers could
recognize HDTV's better quality picture when comparing it
side-by-side to a conventional TV picture, but most could not tell
the difference when alternately watching an HDTV picture separately
from a conventional one.
   Two hundred sixty-eight viewers participated in HBO's in
side-by-side testing and 499 in an alternate viewing test. Both
groups were watched 25-inch conventional sets and 28-inch HDTV sets.
   Maxwell said his results were preliminary and his research was
not yet completed. But, he said, ``when we have better equipment
and material and tests, I think the results will show consumers
have high interest'' in HDTV, though ``they aren't going to pay a
lot more for a TV set than they are now.''
   The HBO and Media Lab research indicates that the introduction
of HDTV to American consumers could be slow, especially considering
that the first HDTV sets are estimated to cost more than $3,500. As
with most new technology, prices would be expected to drop as sales
increase.
   Neuman said his research contradicts the accepted wisdom of
video professionals ``which posits that HDTV knocks the socks off
everyone who sees it, represents an entirely new medium for
storing, transmitting and displaying moving images, and will
replace older media just as color TV replaced black and white.''
   The Media Lab study, admittedly an early experiment, was
conducted in a shopping mall in Danvers, Mass., in early December.
For 30 minutes, 613 randomly selected shoppers, in groups of five
to 20, watched a variety of programs on conventional and HDTV sets.
   Sixty-two percent said they preferred the quality of HDTV
overall, a figure Neuman said shows the new technology will not be
a revolutionary development.
   He said he finds no basis for TV broadcasters' fears that their
very survival could be threatened if the Japanese begin selling
HDTV video cassette recorders and receivers in the United States
before broadcasters settle on an HDTV transmission system for their
over-the-air signals.
   The Japanese plan to offer a satellite-based high definition TV
system to homes in that country in 1990. The Europeans are expected
to introduce their own system a couple of years later, but U.S.
research has lagged.

<HEAD>Contras Agree To Resume Technical Talks On Peace Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan rebels agreed to a call
from the leftist Sandinista government to resume technical talks on
a cease-fire plan that had stalled over arms shipments to the
U.S.-supported Contras.
   In another development, the opposition newspaper La Prensa
received a fresh supply of newsprint from the government on Monday
and said it would resume publication today for the first time since
April 5.
   Cristiana Chamorro, La Prensa assistant director, said the paper
received 42 tons of newsprint from the government-owned monopoly at
mid-day Monday, too late for La Prensa editors to put out an
afternoon edition.
   La Prensa had attributed the cutoff of newsprint to
``discrimination of the government.'' It noted that Barricada, the
Sandinista party mouthpiece, and the pro-government El Nuevo Diario
continued to publish without interruption.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance, the main Contra umbrella group, on
Monday night said it will send a delegation to the southern town of
Sapoa on Wednesday to resume the talks. There was no immediate
reaction from the government.
   Earlier Monday, the Sandinistas proposed that the talks be held
Wednesday or Thursday and suggested the Contras send an advance
team to Managua to prepare for high-ranking political discussions
scheduled for Friday.
   In Washington, D.C., Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros released a
statement proposing the technical talks resume at noon Wednesday in
Sapoa.
   Top-level Contra leaders will travel to Managua on Friday to
continue the peace negotiations with the Sandinistas based on
progress at the Sapoa talks, the statement said. ``The high level
commission composed of members of the directorate will arrive in
Managua April 15 subject to the work of the special commission,''
it said.
   The statement added that Roberto Ferrey, secretary of the
resistance directorate, and David Stadhagen, another Contra
representative, will arrive in Managua on Thursday to work out the
agenda for the high-level meeting.
   Last Friday, military commanders of the two sides suspended
negotiations on defining how the Contras are to gather in
cease-fire zones in Nicaragua. The meetings ended after the Contras
asked for a recess of several days to discuss a 25-point government
plan.
   The talks are called for in the March 23 cease-fire agreement
reached by Sandinista and Contra leaders in Sapoa. Under terms of
the plan, Contra guerrillas were to gather at the zones during the
first 15 days of April. A provisional 60-day cease-fire went into
effect April 1.
   In six days of discussions, both sides agreed on seven zones but
failed to define the operating conditions and security measures.
   A 34-point Contra proposal would allow the rebels to maintain
munitions in the zones. It also would prohibit the Sandinistas from
receiving any military aid from the Soviet bloc.
   Paul Reichler, an American lawyer negotiating for the
Sandinistas, described those two points as ``absolutely
unacceptable.''
   The cease-fire plan would permit the Contras to receive only
food and basic supplies channeled through a neutral organization.
   Political leaders of both sides had been scheduled to meet last
Wednesday in Managua but the rebels postponed the meeting, saying
the technical talks in Sapoa had not advanced enough to move toward
political issues.
   The rebels also have said they will not continue the high-level
political talks unless they are free to meet with opposition
leaders in Managua.
   The government maintains that the peace agreement specifies
Contra representation in politics begins only after the rebels move
into the cease-fire zones.

<HEAD>U.S. Pleased With Revocation Of Amnesty In Slaying Of Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy applauded a
decision by President Jose Napoleon Duarte that revoked an amnesty
for three men charged in the 1985 slaying of six Americans.
   Duarte cited an international treaty as the legal basis for
denying amnesty to the three suspects, said Rene Valdivieso, the
secretary of the Martial Court, who announced the decision Monday.
   ``On the issue of amnesty, it has been the position of the U.S.
government that this attack on innocent unarmed persons should not
go unpunished,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Joseph McManus. ``We
welcome President Duarte's decision to forward the case to the
courts where evidence can be brought and a decision rendered.''
   Thirteen people were killed on June 19, 1985, when assailants
wearing Salvadoran ary uniforms opened fire with automatic weapons
on patrons at two outdoor cafes in San Salvador. Among the dead
were four off-duty Marines and two U.S. businessmen.
   The Marines, who were guards at the U.S. Embassy, wore civilian
clothes and sat at two tables with other young people when the
attackers drove up.
   A little-known leftist group, the Mardoqueo Cruz Urban Guerrilla
Commandos, claimed responsibility for the killings. The group is an
offshoot of one of the five guerrilla armies that form the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which has been fighting
the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government for eight years.
   Juan Garcia Melendez and Jose Dimas Aguilar are charged with
helping plan the ``Pink Zone massacre,'' named after the
fashionable district of shops and restaurants where the killings
occurred.
   William Rivas Bolanos is the only one of the three the
government alleges was among the gunmen.
   None of the three has been tried. Eight other people, who are
fugitives, allegedly took part in the crime.
   Duarte's government decreed a broad amnesty in November 1987 as
part of a regional peace accord. About 450 people were freed under
the measure, which applied to those convicted or accused of
politically motivated crimes.
   When the Martial Court, the country's highest military tribunal,
ruled in January that the three men should receive amnesty, the
U.S. government called the decision ``morally mistaken and
politically damaging.''
   The U.S. Congress later approved a measure that calls for
withholding 10 percent of appropriated economic aid to El Salvador
if the suspects are freed. The three were kept in jail pending
Duarte's review of the case.
   A lower court military judge had ruled the three should be
covered by the amnesty because their alleged crime was politically
motivated. Duarte, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, is
empowered to review the Martial Court's decision.
   The treaty cited by Duarte, the Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons, was
ratified by El Salvador in 1980.
   ``According to the president, the treaty takes precedence over
the amnesty law,'' Valdivieso told reporters.
   Lawyer Armando Portillo, representing the suspects, said he has
not decided whether to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. He
called Duarte's reasoning ``arbitrary.''
   The amnesty program was part of El Salvador's compliance with a
Central American peace plan signed in August 1987 by Duarte and the
presidents of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala.
   About one-third of those freed under the program were leftist
guerrillas. Another third were accused or convicted of crimes,
including murder and torture, by rightist organizations. The
political leanings of the other third was unclear.
   Two former national guardsmen convicted in the 1981 murders of
two U.S. land reform advisers were freed under the amnesty. Five
national guardsmen convicted in the 1980 murders of four American
churchwomen were not covered by the measure.

   Anita Page, star of the 1929 film ``Broadway
Melody,'' was taken to a hospital by ambulance before the 60th
annual Academy Awards began Monday night, authorities said.
   ``We were near the door when she let out a moan and collapsed.
She was unconscious for about 10 minutes,'' said the actress'
husband, retired Rear Adm. Herschel House.
   ``She fainted,'' said a nursing coordinator at the Hospital of
the Good Samaritan who did not want her name used. ``She is here
and in stable condition. We ran some blood tests, but I can't give
you any more details.
   ``She will be discharged soon.''
   House said Miss Page might stay at the hospital overnight.
   ``We don't know what it was. Her vital signs are fine and she's
improving,'' her husband said.
   Miss Page, 77, made 33 films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was to
participate in a production number during Monday night's Oscar
broadcast that featured a representative from each of the 59 Best
Picture Academy Awards, said House.
   Miss Page and her husband live in Coronado, south of San Diego.

   A federal judge has ordered presidential
assailant John W. Hinckley Jr. to be questioned in a deposition
prior to a civil trial arising from the 1981 shooting of President
Reagan.
   U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn on Monday approved a
motion by lawyers representing White House press secretary James S.
Brady and two other people wounded in the March 30, 1981, shooting
to question Hinckley before the case goes to trial later this month.
   The trial of the multimillion-dollar lawsuits brought by Brady,
retired Washington policeman Thomas K. Delahanty and Secret Service
agent Timothy J. McCarthy is scheduled to begin April 26 before
Penn.
   Hinckley, who was confined to St. Elisabeths mental hospital
here following his 1982 acquittal by reason of insanity of
attempted murder charges, has asked to attend the trial, which
could last several days.
   Penn said at a hearing that he has made arrangements with the

<HEAD>Amnesty To Be Extended to Aliens Who Overstayed Visas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says that it will immediately
begin accepting applications for amnesty from illegal aliens who
overstayed their student and tourist visas.
   Until further notice, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
also announced Monday that it will defer the fee for such
applications and issue a temporary work authorization card, in
accordance with a court directive.
   INS regulations originally stipulated that non-immigrant aliens
who overstayed their tourist or student visas must demonstrate that
any violation of their immigration status had come to the attention
of the INS before Jan. 1, 1982, for them to qualify for the amnesty
program.
   In a ruling on a class-action suit, U.S. District Judge Stanley
Sporkin said the regulation was too restrictive and declared that
Congress intended the law to mean that any government record, such
as tax or Social Security documents, could be used to document that
an illegal alien was known to federal authorities as of Jan. 1,
1982.
   Immigration experts say the clarifications affect at least
50,000 people.
   Under the 1986 immigration law, illegal aliens who have been in
the country at least since Jan. 1, 1982, may qualify for legalized
status. A 12-month application period for the amnesty program is
due to expire May 4.

   A pizza parlor owner wanted in Italy in
connection with the murder of a Sicilian judge has been ordered
deported by an Immigration and Naturalization Service judge.
   Salvatore Inzerillo, part-owner of a restaurant in Woodbridge,
Va., had asked to be allowed to leave the country voluntarily.
   But Judge Joan V. Arrowsmith Monday denied the request, saying
that would allow Inzerillo to go to the country of his choice. She
said he should be returned to Italy for trial.
   Inzerillo has been in INS custody since Feb. 23. Italian
authorities have issued an arrest warrant for him in the 1980
slaying of Judge Gaetano Costa, who was investigating drug
trafficking in Sicily.
   FBI agent James L. Glass Jr. testified that Inzerillo had
connections with the Mafia, but Inzerillo denied being a member of

   Inzerillo said he hired a smuggler to get him into the United

<TEXT>
   Dave Prater Sr. of the Grammy-Award
winning Sam and Dave soul duo who sang the 1960s' hit ``Hold On,
I'm Comin''' and whose fame was revived with the Blues Brothers
re-recording of ``Soul Man,'' has died.
   He was 50 and was killed Saturday when the car he was driving
went off Interstate 75 near Sycamore, Ga., and slammed into a tree.
   Prater was on his way to visit his mother, Mary, in Ocilla, the
small Georgia town where he grew up, said his widow, Rosemary. The
Praters have lived in Paterson since 1974 and his body will be
returned to New Jersey for burial next week, she said Monday.
   A passenger was seriously injured in the accident, which
occurred about 8 a.m. Saturday near Sycamore, a small town about
200 miles south of Atlanta.
   The passenger, Charmaine C. Marks, 46, of Union City, Ga., was
listed in serious condition early today at Tift County General
Hospital in Tifton, Ga. She was injured when ejected from the car,
which then landed on her, Georgia state troopers said.
   ``Dave was very strong and very able and entertaining was his
life,'' Mrs. Prater said of her husband.
   Prater met partner Sam Moore in Miami in 1958. Their
Memphis-style soul, including the hit ``Hold On I'm Comin,''' won
them popularity through the 1960s and a Grammy Award for ``Soul
Man.'' But by the early 1970s, their popularity had waned, and in
1981, Moore and Prater broke up.
   Prater resumed the Sam and Dave act in 1982, but with a new
partner, Sam Daniels of Miami.
   Daniels said he saw Prater the Sunday before he died when they
performed together in Atlanta.
   ``I still feel a little shocked,'' he said Monday night.
   ``Soul Man'' was revived as a hit by Dan Aykroyd and John
Belushi in the 1980 movie ``The Blues Brothers.''
   Lately, Prater had run into trouble with drugs, although Mrs.
Prater said he seemed to have the problem beat.
   Prater was arrested last summer in Paterson for selling a vial
of crack to an undercover police officer. He pleaded guilty and was
sentenced March 5 to three years' probation and ordered to pay a
$2,580 fine and perform 150 hours of community service.
   A funeral service will be held Ocilla on Thursday and his body
will be flown back to New Jersey for burial Monday, his wife said.
   Prater also is survived by five children from an earlier
marriage.

   ``Go, go, go, go, go!'' chanted fans on each side of a
red-carpeted walkway leading to the cavernous hall, as nominees
arrived Monday amid a hullabaloo that has become an annual rite of
the Academy Awards ceremony.
   Cher, who won best actress for ``Moonstruck,'' continued her
tradition of outrageous outfits despite the seeming consensus among
the stars this year for toned-down, mostly black fashions _ in
variations of long, short, strapless, body-hugging and
black-on-white or white-on-black.
   Arriving fashionably late in the 90-degree heat, Cher knocked
the scream meter off the scale when she stepped from her limousine
in a diaphanous outfit partly covered by a dark black cape and
swept into the auditorium.
   However, for a time the Oscar ritual of hasty introductions,
interviews and cheers for favorite stars gave way to a traffic jam,
perhaps caused by the show's move from its longtime home at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the Los Angeles Music Center.
   ``Please make room for the people outside to get in!'' Oscars
greeter Army Archerd pleaded over a loudspeaker as arriving members
of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and nominees
backed up at the auditorium's doors as showtime neared.
   ``We are working in very tight quarters,'' said Archerd. ``The
Academy has decided to be here for three years, so you better get
used to it.''
   ``Booooo,'' shouted the crowd packed into bleachers alongside
the walkway.
   The 60th annual Oscars marked the award show's first return to
the Shrine, on the edge of an old neighborhood next to the
University of Southern California, since 1947.
   ``The traffic was so bad I was being asphyxiated in the limo,''
said character actor Peter Mark Richman, who appears in TV's
``Bonanza: The Next Generation.''
   Fans dressed in shorts, sandals and T-shirts watched a 10-block
procession of limousines and frequented a garden hose that was set
up by the Academy for curbside refreshment in the heat.
   Fifteen minutes before showtime, actresses Meryl Streep and
Glenn Close, who is nine months pregnant, were seen walking quickly
up Jefferson Boulevard to the theater to make it on time.
   ``Fatal Attraction'' co-star Anne Archer wore a wide-shouldered,
sleeveless black dress with a V-cut back and a silvered midriff
along with black gloves. Sally Kirkland, star of ``Anna,'' was
elegant in a strapless black gown with a velvet bodice.
   Faye Dunaway was sharp in a black skirt and a white jacket with
a black-stripe design. ``Dirty Dancing'' star Jennifer Grey came in
a tight, shoulderless, long-sleeve mini. Liza Minnelli topped a
long black dress with a red cape.
   There were daring exceptions. Candice Bergen arrived
bare-shouldered in a form-fitting red dress. Marlee Matlin stepped
out in strapless, knee-length purple dress with a large bow at her
waist. Daryl Hannah glittered in a white-gold, knee-length dress
and gold high heels.
   And, of course, the perennial Edie Williams strutted back and
forth in front of the cameras in a pale blue bikini top and mini
skirt, sporting a puppy on one shoulder.
   Archerd later whipped up the fans with an impromptu fan poll.
The best picture winner on the applause meter was ``Moonstruck.''
The movie, however, lost out in the Academy voting to ``The Last
Emperor,'' which garnered that Oscar and eight others.

<HEAD>Jackson Moves Further From Arafat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson continued to reach out to Jewish
voters by further distancing himself from Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat as the candidates enter the final
week of campaigning before the delegate-rich New York primary.
   When asked Monday about meeting with Arafat, Jackson said: ``It
would not be a good approach to start at the table with the most
extreme elements _ that's a formula for catastrophe.''
   Rather, the Democratic presidential contender said, ``In this
city some of your top Palestinian leaders in the world live. Some
of your top Jewish-American and pro-Israeli leaders live. We should
begin to talk here, to implore both sides to a higher level of
security.''
   Jackson's remarks caused some Arab-American supporters to
chastise him Monday, while others rallied to his defense.
   On Sunday, Jackson said that, if elected president, he would not
meet again with Arafat. Jackson has been widely criticized for
meeting with Arafat in 1979.
   Abdeen Jabara, president of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, accused Jackson of abandoning his
principles in his quest for the presidency.
   But James Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American
Institute, said Jackson has a nine-year record of commitment to
Palestinian rights and to justice for both Israelis and
Palestinians.
   Nearly one quarter of the Democrats expected to vote in New
York's April 19 primary are Jewish, and for many of them, the
future of Israel is a critical issue.
   While in New York, Jackson also continued his appeal to
blue-collar voters. Some union leaders called Jackson ``one of us''
at a labor rally on his behalf.
   ``He's the only candidate who will get on the picket line and
walk with the workers,'' said Karen Lantz, vice president of the
Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, after Jackson
addressed a crowd of 5,000 labor leaders and union members Monday
night.
   Lantz, who characterized Jackson as ``one of us,'' said the
other candidates may support labor, but ``you never see them.''
   Jackson told the overflow crowd at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center that blue-collar workers ``will have a friend in
the White House'' if he becomes president.
   Jackson reminded the crowd that he has stood with them numerous
times on picket lines, and asked them to stand with him now by
supporting his candidacy.
   Jackson also campaigned north of the city Monday, addressing a
rally at Rockland Community College and greeting workers at a
General Motors plant in North Tarrytown.
   At the GM plant and the labor rally, he sounded his familiar
theme of battling economic violence and told the workers: ``We
built our campaign at the plant gate.''
   Jackson is only a handful of delegates behind Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts in the Democratic race. Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. is running third.

<HEAD>Sonny Bono Headlines Elections in California, Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sonny Bono, whose ex-wife Cher won best actress at the Oscars,
vied for best candidate in a mayoral race with six opponents today
in Palm Springs, Calif., one of several elections in Texas and
California.
   In Texas, Rep. Beau Boulter of Amarillo opposed Houston
businessman Wes Gilbreath in a primary runoff for the Republican
nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   In San Francisco, eight candidates were running in a special
election to fill the state Assembly seat vacated by Mayor Art
Agnos. The top contenders were former U.S. Rep. John Burton, 55,
and fellow liberal Democrat Roberta Achtenberg, 37, a lesbian
rights lawyer whose election would make her the legislature's first
openly gay member.
   Bono, a 53-year-old entertainer and restaurateur, built a
recording career with Cher during more than the two decades, and
was the butt of her jokes during their TV variety show. Cher won
the best actress at Monday night's Oscar ceremonies for her
performance in the movie ``Moonstruck.''
   Bono said he has campaigned hard to convince voters his
candidacy for the part-time, $15,000-a-year mayor's job was no
publicity stunt. ``They thought it was a joke,'' he said recently.
``Now they take me seriously.''
   Also running were Vice Mayor Eli Birer, businesswoman Deyna
Hodges, accountant Lloyd Maryanov, Agua Caliente Indian Tribe
Secretary Ray Patencio, real estate agent Neil Beatty and retired
dentist Lewis Friedman.
   The Texas runoff was required because no candidate received a
majority in the March 8, four-way GOP primary.
   Gilbreath, who has spent about $1 million of his own money in
the race, was the top candidate with 37 percent of the vote.
Boulter, who received 30 percent, later picked up endorsements from
the third- and fourth-place finishers as well as the majority of
Texas Republican leaders.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., campaigned Monday for Boulter in several
Texas cities. Boulter, a 46-year-old two-term congressman, backed
Kemp's failed bid for the GOP presidential nomination.
   The presidential race and Gilbreath's money were the campaign's
main issues. Gilbreath, a 59-year-old first-time office seeker,
said Boulter's support of Kemp would hurt Texas if Vice President
George Bush becomes president.
   Boulter said Gilbreath supported former television evangelist
Pat Robertson's unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential
nomination. Gilbreath has declined to say he voted for in Texas'
Republican presidential primary.
   The Boulter campaign, which spent about $250,000, complained
about Gilbreath's deep pockets.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, breezed to
renomination in March over a little-known San Antonio professor.
The incumbent has said he does not care which Republican he faces
in his November bid for a fourth term.
   In San Francisco, Achtenberg, 37, campaigned Monday at transit
stations and a senior citizens' home.
   ``We are extremely optimistic,'' she said. ``It all depends on
the voter turnout. Our polls indicate it's a dead heat.''
   Burton visited churches in the district on Sunday, reminding
parishioners of his civil rights voting record and that of his late
brother, Phillip, and late sister-in-law, Sala, who also
represented the city in Congress.
   Burton, who held the Assembly seat between 1965 and 1975, was
sidelined from politics in 1983 by a cocaine addiction.
   The other candidates were Republicans Max Woods and Brian
Mavrogeorge, Libertarian George Meyer, Peace and Freedom candidate
Melissa Ehman, and independents Hope Joles and James Schmitt.
   The district is overwhelmingly Democratic, and candidates from
other parties were given little chance of mounting serious
opposition.
   If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters will
face each other in a runoff June 7.
   Agnos' two-year term ends this year, and the Democratic primary
for the seat also will be held June 7.

<DATELINE>LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet
today said they have named their aircraft ``the plane of martyrdom
and death'' and claimed they have put on their ``death shrouds.''
   One of the hijackers made the declaration in a statement radioed
to Larnaca Airport control tower. He cited Koranic verses usually
read at funerals that said ``those killed in the name of God are
always alive.''
   Earlier today, the hijackers of the Kuwait Airways 747, who shot
and killed a second passenger on Monday, threatened the lives of
the nearly 50 remaining hostages and again demanded fuel for the
plane so they could leave Cyprus for an unspecified ``neutral
country.''
   The hijackers, who are armed with grenades and handguns, did not
explain whether their statement today meant they planned to carry
out their oft-repeated threat to blow up the plane.
   However, their statement revealed, as had been suspected, that
the hijackers are fanatical Shiite Moslems.
   The statement said ``hail the glory of Imam Mahdi,'' the
messiah-like holy person Shiites believe will one day appear on
earth. Only Shiite Moslems revere the imams, or saints, among the
Islamic sects. Before the statement, it only was known for certain
that the hijackers were Arab-speaking.
   The hijackers have demanded Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists, all but one of them Shiites, who were convicted in 1984
for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait. The emirate
has repeatedly refused to free them.
   Akis Fantis, Cypriot government spokesman, earlier today said no
negotiations were under way as the hijacking entered its eighth
day. Fantis added that the chances of storming the plane at Larnaca
Airport were ``zero.''
   Fifty-two people _ including at least five or six hijackers _
were believed to be aboard the Boeing 747 after the bloodstained
body of a man was thrown through the jet's door on Monday, his
hands tied behind his back. The hostages include three members of
Kuwait's extensive royal family _ a man and two women.
   On Monday, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah said his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather
than give in to the hijackers.
   ``We will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the
plane, but we will not surrender to any blackmail, even if we lose
more of them,'' he told reporters in Kuwait. ``This is not the
decision of Kuwait's government. It is a decision of the people.''
He added that the presence of three members of the ruling Al-Sabah
family aboard the jet ``will not influence our decision.''
   To complicate matters, terrorist groups in Lebanon have
threatened to kill foreign hostages they are holding, including
three Americans, if security forces storm the plane in a bid to
free the passengers.
   In their statement today, the hijackers declared in classical,
Koranic Arabic: ``We have decided to call our plane the plane of
martyrdom and death. Death with glory is better than life under
humiliation... We call on the Kuwaiti people to revolt against the
Kuwaiti dictatorship. We'd like to point out we're not against the
people of Kuwait, but against the regime.''
   It continued: ``We have decided to wear the death shrouds under
our clothes and that either all our 17 brothers come back to us or
else we shall meet, in our shrouds, in the heaven of eternal
happiness.''
   The reference to wearing death shrouds ``under our clothes'' may
have indicated the hijackers are not yet prepared to become
martyrs. But the tone of the statement, and its repeated references
to death, appeared designed to put pressure on Cypriot authorities
to refuel the plane.
   After the passenger was killed Monday, an unidentified hijacker
told the tower: ``We have executed a Kuwaiti officer. We also
reconfirm the craft must be refueled immediately, immediately,
before we take more dangerous steps.''
   Fantis said the slain passenger had been shot twice in the head
and that fingerprints were being sent to Kuwait for identification.
   Doctors at the Larnaca morgue said the side of his face was
badly injured, possibly because he had been beaten before he was
killed when officials refused repeated demands by the hijackers to
refuel the plane.
   The hostage slain on Monday was the second of three Kuwaiti
military men reported aboard the jet. Doctors said another military
man, a 24-year-old border guard, also was beaten 18 to 24 hours
before he was shot three times in the head on Saturday and dropped
on the tarmac.
   The reference to flying to a ``neutral country'' was the first
time since landing at Larnaca that the hijackers have given any
inkling of where they want to go. They did not name any country.
But Kuwait's Al-Qabas daily on Monday reported that Algerian
officials have become involved in the negotiations.
   The plane was hijacked on Tuesday with 112 people aboard on a
flight from Bangkok to Kuwait and forced down in Mashhad, northeast
Iran, where 57 people were freed. The plane left Iran on Friday
after refueling.
   After Lebanon and Syria refused to let it touch down at their
airports, the plane landed at Larnaca after the pilot radioed he
was running out of fuel.
   Another captive, an ailing 32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed in
Larnaca on Saturday, apparently after PLO intervention.

   Cher celebrated by exclaiming ``Anybody can
do anything,'' Sean Connery knocked back a few drinks and Olympia
Dukakis telephoned her presidential candidate cousin in New York
with the good news.
   These were some of the highlights of chit-chat backstage Monday
night, as Oscar winners and presenters shuttled into a huge white
tent erected behind the Shrine Auditorium where the 60th-annual
Academy Awards presentations were made.
   With an estimated billion people watching the show on
television, the parking lot big top was teeming with hundreds of
reporters brimming with questions at an ongoing news conference
during the ceremony.
   How does it feel? What does it mean? What are you going to do
with the statuette? Gabriella Cristiani, winner of the editing
Oscar for ``The Last Emperor,'' was most succinct: ``I'm just
happy. I don't know what it means.''
   But most winners of behind-the-scenes Oscars _ those for
editing, costumes and the like _ were ignored by reporters. One of
the co-winners of the visual effects award stood at a microphone
and, questionless, began singing ``Moon River.''
   An ambulance took an unconscious actress to a hospital after she
collapsed near the lobby in 90-degree heat before the show began,
touching off whirlwind of backstage rumor and questioning. It was
finally determined Anita Page, the 77-year-old star of ``Broadway
Melody,'' fainted and was all right.
   Reporters from the Village Voice, Daily Variety, the Hollywood
Reporter, USA Today and columnists Roger Ebert and Marilyn Beck
blurted out questions then scribbled answers on note pads and
punched quotes into portable computers.
   At the same time, they listened to acceptance speeches on
earphones feeding them audio from the inside the Shrine. Two giant
television screens were the reporters' link to the show. The media
is not allowed inside the auditorium.
   Cher, who won as best actress for ``Moonstruck,'' and Miss
Dukakis, the best supporting actress for the same movie, both
revealed they were rooting for political candidates. Miss Dukakis
boosted the presidential aspirations of her cousin, Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, and Cher put in a good word for ex-husband
Sonny Bono's bid today as Palm Springs mayor.
   ``OK Michael, let's go!'' said Miss Dukakis during the ceremony;
Cher said she wasn't sure if Bono would win, but said: ``I hope
so.''
   Miss Dukakis excused herself, saying her cousin was waiting for
her call in an Italian restaurant in New York City, where he is
campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. ``It's the year of
the Dukaki,'' she said.
   Sipping on a glass of wine, Sean Connery stepped before the
backstage microphone and declared his award for best supporting
actor was ``an accumulation of the body of his work.''
   ``I'm going to have a few drinks,'' he said when asked how he
would celebrate.
   A footsore Cher carried her black high heels in one hand and her
Oscar in the other, apologizing to reporters for her aching feet.
But the topic of conversation focused on her see-through Bob Mackie
gown.
   ``I don't think it's too far,'' Cher said, looking down at the
sparse coverage that left little to the imagination. ``Everything's
covered. I don't think you can see anything. There's not much to
see anyway.''
   Her son Elijah Blue Allman was promised the Oscar statuette for
the night and from there it will spend an extended period on her
bedroom fireplace.
   ``If I can win this statue, I think anybody can do anything,''
Cher said.
   The 5-week-old Writers Guild of America strike was an occasional
topic of backstage conversation.
   Best-actor winner Michael Douglas said he was taking the summer
off because his next project couldn't proceed without the writers,
but presenter Billy Crystal, a union writer and performer, was
unfazed.
   ``It didn't really affect me. We were doing old material, that's
why there's nothing topical,'' said Crystal.
   ``My entire monologue was generously donated by five
Teamsters,'' quipped show host Chevy Chase. ``There may be a
writer's strike, but there isn't a readers strike.''

<HEAD>Hearing Begins Into Blood Test Not Allowed in Criminal Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A type of blood test barred as evidence in
Michigan criminal trials is on trial itself this week, as
supporters seek to overturn the state Supreme Court's 1986 ruling
declaring it inadmissible.
   Prosecutors from Wayne and Kent counties claim electrophoresis
has been refined since the high court's decision. Attorneys
representing two defendants against whom test results could be
applied deny the prosecutors' claims.
   The Supreme Court's 1986 ruling came on a 3-2 decision with two
justices not taking part. Since then, one of the justices in the
majority _ former Chief Justice G. Mennen Williams _ has died and
has been replaced by Robert Griffin.
   In an unusual arrangement, Circuit Judges Robert Benson of Kent
County and Maureen Reilly of Wayne County began taking testimony
Monday in a joint evidentiary hearing. Assistant prosecutors Mark
Vander Molen of Kent County and Paul Bruno of Wayne County are
seeking decisions from the judges allowing use of electrophoresis
tests as evidence in stabbing cases they are handling.
   Vander Molen is prosecuting a case against Robert Tanner, 26,
charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder. Bruno is
prosecuting Scott Stoughton, 21, charged with two counts of
first-degree murder in the deaths of two people in Taylor.
   ``We think the (Supreme Court) decision was a mistake and we
hope to correct it,'' Vander Molen said before Monday's hearing
began.
   But Bernard Schaefer, Tanner's attorney, said he doesn't think
the test has been accepted generally by scientists for use in
criminal trials.
   ``I think the prosecution and the prosecution community want to
change the ruling,'' he said. ``There's been a change in the
(Supreme) court. ... It's not that there has been a scientific
advancement.''
   Electrophoresis is a process to separate molecules of a
substance by their electrical charge. It has been used in genetic
testing, identification of certain enzymes in a variety of organs
and in analysis of DNA, which carries genetic characteristics.
   The hearing is expected to last a week and should involve
detailed scientific testimony about proteins, enzymes and
``markers'' they leave in dried blood.
   Vander Molen said use of the test in his case against Tanner is
not critical. But, he said: ``We've got nearly 10 cases in which we
need this test. This kind of evidence is important in the most
serious of cases.''

<HEAD>Researchers Gather for Pain Conference</HEAD>

   Describing an ache may be easy to the sufferer,
but to pain researchers the feeling of hurt is complex almost
beyond description.
   Researchers at a four-day international ``Pain Measurement''
conference that began Monday are trying to develop a unified theory
for the study of pain. The conference is sponsored by the
University of Washington and funded by a grant from the National
Institutes of Health.
   One in three people in America suffers from chronic pain and
millions are routinely incapacitated by it, but medical science
often can do little to to prevent or effectively treat recurrent
pain, because patients are suffering from something that can't be
seen, felt or observed by someone else.
   The subjective and intangible nature of pain frustrates many
people involved in its research.
   ``The problem with the meaning of the word pain has been around
since Aristotle,'' said Dr. John D. Loeser, a neurosurgeon and
director of the university's Multidisciplinary Pain Center.
   ``How do you go about measuring pain?'' Loeser asks. ``We're not
very far along in the clinical setting. It's too complex a
phenomenon.''
   Only within about the last two decades has the problem of pain
gained serious attention in medical research, in large part because
of the pioneering efforts of Dr. John Bonica, chairman emeritus of
the school's department of anesthesiology. Bonica's work on the
management of pain, which emphasizes a comprehensive approach
rather than hit-and-miss drug therapies, paved the way for the
serious study of pain.
   ``Everybody measures pain in a different way,'' said C. Richard
Chapman, a psychopharmacologist in pain research at the university
and the independent Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
   ``We don't at present have a theory, a single theory, that
everyone agrees upon,'' said Chapman.
   Pain measurement research generally relies on laboratory tests
of animals, lab tests on humans or studies of patient care, each
with its own accepted methods for measuring and defining pain. None
completely translates into an acceptable method for the other.
   Chapman said pain often is taken seriously by medical
professionals only when tissue damage can be identified, although a
lot of chronic pain apparently exists without any identifiable
tissue damage.
   Some researchers try to measure this kind of pain by analyzing
behavior or looking at brain waves and other electrical signals.
   Those dealing with humans ask the sufferer to describe the hurt,
``but how can you tell if an infant, who can't yet speak, is
experiencing pain?'' asked Loeser.
   University of Washington researchers expect a good deal of
argument and contention at the conference. In fact, they
deliberately scheduled scientists with opposing views to speak in
succession. About 60 researchers are expected to attend.
   ``It's my belief that we can bring this all together if we can
find a uniform theory for pain,'' said Chapman. ``When we have
reached it, our power to solve the perplexities of pain
scientifically and to control the human and animal suffering that
it causes will be greatly increased.''

<HEAD>Tokyo Market Hits Record High Closing; Dollar Edges Upward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's key stock market indicator closed today at
an all-time high and the U.S. dollar climbed in trading against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
175.98 points Monday, added another 5.97 points, or 0.02 percent,
to close at 26,930.84.
   On Monday, the stock market's key barometer briefly touched a
new high of 26,998.36 points during the morning trading, but then
fell back.
   Boosted by the steady dollar and a strong Monday showing on Wall
Street, the Nikkei index soared again today to 26,976.21 points
minutes after the start of trading.
   Then profit-taking set in, indicating ``the market was rising
too high (and) eased share prices a little in the afternoon,'' said
Tadaaki Uehara of Wako Securities.
   However, the index rose again in the market's last hour, led by
blue chip electricals, Uehara said. Many investors were encouraged
by the dollar's stability and felt the electricals would continue
to benefit from the stable dollar, traders said.
   Other popular issues included precision machineries, drugs and
constructions. Losers included chemicals, securities and real
estates.
   Volume on the first section trade was estimated at a moderate
750 million shares, down from 900 million shares Monday.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
closed at 126.50 yen, up 0.79 yen from its close Monday of 125.71
yen and up also from its opening today of 126.40 yen.
   ``It appears the dollar has stabilized at what it should be,''
said a foreign exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Trading was mixed in dollar-buying and selling, with a strong
wait-and-see attitude among participants regarding this week's
meeting in Washington of monetary authorities from seven major
economic nations, he said.
   The bank dealer said Japan's shrinking trade deficit contributed
to the dollar-buying.
   Japan's trade surplus in fiscal 1987 declined 15.3 percent from
the previous year, the first such drop in six years, shrinking from
$89.736 billion in 1986 to $76.015 billion last year, according to
the Finance Ministry.

<HEAD>Convicted Murderer Flies To Israel To Finish Murder Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted murderer has flown to Israel after
renouncing his citizenship under a special clemency agreement that
allowed him to finish his prison term working on a kibbutz.
   William Shapiro, 62, had served 13 years of a life term that
carried a minimum 25-year sentence when he boarded an El Al jet
Monday night.
   A notary public witnessed his renunciation after a federal judge
said it did not fall under his authority.
   ``I have researched the law thoroughly, but I have found nothing
in any federal law which gives me jurisdiction to accept such
renunciation,'' Judge Eugene P. Spellman told Shapiro and defense
attorney Jan Jacobowitz before calling a notary public to the
courtroom.
   Shapiro was granted clemency under an agreement between the
state Board of Executive Clemency, made up of Gov. Bob Martinez and
his Cabinet, and the Israeli government because of Shapiro's past
ties to Israel's old Haganah, a secret military force that helped
win Israeli independence in 1948.
   Shapiro, a Miami businessman born in New York, was accused of
hiring two men to kill a business partner. A Dade County circuit
jury convicted him in February 1976 of first-degree murder and
conspiracy to commit murder for the pipe-beating death of Burt
deWitt.
   But Shapiro's supporters have long pointed to his Haganah
background, his World War II and Korean War service as a Marine
combat officer and his 12 years with Israel's police to support
their claim that he couldn't have been been guilty.
   Elements of the Haganah, with about 10,000 members by the
mid-1930s, served with the British in defense of the Middle East
during World War II. After Israel gained independence in 1948, the
Haganah became the core of Israel's army.
   Shapiro's legal file shows he didn't participate directly in the
pipe-beating.
   ``The evidence just wasn't very strong against Shapiro,'' said
attorney Alvin Lodish, who was asked to handle the case by Israel's
consul general in Miami, Rahamin Timor. ``It is highly unusual to
have someone convicted of first-degree murder on evidence like
that.''
   Clemency was granted last month. Under the deal, Shapiro had to
renounce his U.S. citizenship and relocate at Kibbutz
Ayelet-Hashar, where he will work at least eight hours a day, six
days a week.
   Herut Lapid, director of the United Kibbutz Movement of which
the collective farm is a member, assured Florida officials in a
letter that a rehabilitation plan has been worked out for Shapiro.

   Despite U.S. criticism, Israel today threatened
to deport more Palestinians from the occupied territories to break
a 4-month-old uprising. On Monday, Israel expelled eight Arabs to
neighboring Lebanon.
   In another development, Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinians
on Monday during clashes in the occupied West Bank. Eight Arabs
were wounded.
   The deaths brought to 143 the number of Arabs killed since
rioting began Dec. 8. Two Israelis have been killed _ a teen-age
settler and a soldier.
   Israel on Monday issued deportation orders for 12 other
Palestinians. Among them were six Arabs from the West Bank village
of Beita, where an Israeli settler girl and two Palestinians were
killed in a clash last week.
   ``There are a list of others slated for deportation. We will not
hesitate to deport them if we find it necessary,'' Shmuel Goren, a
defense official who administers the West Bank, told Israel radio
today.
   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
drew up a list of 200 Palestinians who were slated for expulsion in
January but sharply reduced the number at the time, following an
appeal from the United States.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, interviewed today by Army radio,
said he hoped the expulsions would crush the wave of Arab rioting
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which were captured in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``We know other countries and people in other countries are not
happy with this, but we have to take care of our security and not
them,'' Shamir said.
   Critics on Monday claimed the expulsions were aimed at appeasing
Jewish settlers, who were angered by an army report saying the
girl, 15-year-old Tirza Porat, was accidentally killed by a bullet
from a gun a settler used while guarding a group of Jewish hikers.
Settlers say the girl was killed by Arabs.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman on
Monday said the expulsions ``only further inflame passions'' and
violate international human rights agreements.
   Israeli troops killed two Palestinians on Monday after a patrol
was attacked by dozens of protesters who threw stones and bottles
in the West Bank village of Rai near Nablus, the army said.
   Arab doctors and hospital officials said Israeli soldiers on
Monday wounded eight Palestinians: three in Rai, including an
11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy; four Arabs in Nablus; and
another in Jenin.
   Also Monday, the army said 4,800 Arabs have been arrested since
Dec. 8. Of those, 500 were convicted, 3,400 await trial and 900 are
held in administrative detention, which allows imprisonment without
trial for six months.
   The eight deportees, five from the Gaza Strip and three from the
West Bank, arrived in Lebanon's Bekaa valley on Monday night and
asked to be handed over to the International Red Cross.
   An army helicopter flew the men to Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone in southern Lebanon. They were handed $50 each and
led to two waiting taxis.
   Israel Television showed some of the men carrying belongings in
plastic bags. As the taxis drove off, one of the deportees made the
V for victory sign with his fingers.
   The army described the deportees as senior members of terror
groups and said some were ``organizers and instigators'' of
anti-Israeli protests.
   The most prominent is Abed Al Aziz Uda Rafia, 33, of Gaza City,
described by the army as spiritual leader of Islamic Jihad in the
Gaza Strip. Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, is a Moslem
fundamentalist group pledged to destroying Israel.
   Critics say such measures violate the Geneva Convention, which
bars deportation of civilians in times of war. Israeli officials
maintain the convention only applies to mass expulsions.
   Palestinian leaders on Monday denounced the expulsions as
collective punishment and said they would fuel more unrest.
   The army said the six Beita residents ordered deported took part
in a stoning attack on 16 Israeli teen-age hikers and two armed
guards from the Jewish West Bank settlement of Elon Moreh.
   A preliminary army report concluded that Miss Porat was struck
by a bullet from the gun of Romem Al Dubi, one of two guards
accompanying the hikers.
   The report set off a sharp political debate along party lines,
with settlers and right-wing politicians denouncing it as one-sided
and hasty, and demanding the resignation of the army chief of staff.
   Some hikers insist Miss Porat was shot by an Arab that some saw
pointing a Soviet-made rifle from a rooftop.

   China's legislature approved a new Cabinet today
that includes younger members more closely tied to economic reforms
of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   The 2,859 delegates of the National People's Congress also
passed constitutional amendments sanctioning private businesses and
the right to transfer use of land.
   Delegates confirmed 41 ministerial posts, named three vice
premiers and appointed nine as state councilors to the State
Council, or Cabinet.
   They also trimmed the council as part of government efforts to
become more efficient, eliminating posts for two vice premiers, two
state councilors and four ministers.
   Qian Qichen, 60, who has been vice foreign minister in charge of
relations with the Soviet Union, succeeded Wu Xueqian as foreign
minister, while Gen. Qin Jiwei, 74, a member of the Politburo and
head of the Beijing Military Region, took over the Defense Ministry
from ailing Zhang Aiping, 78.
   The three vice premiers who will serve under Premier Li Peng are
outgoing Foreign Minister Wu, 67, State Planning Commission
Minister Yao Yilin, 71, and Tian Jiyun, 59. Yao and Tian previously
served as vice premiers.
   Ten of the 41 ministers are new, as are seven of the nine state
councilors. The average age of the premier, vice premiers and nine
councilors dropped from 67 to 61.
   The state councilors include people closely identified with
Zhao's economic reforms and policy of opening to the outside world,
such as new State Education Commission Minister Li Tieying and
Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and Chen Junsheng, who also retained his
post of secretary general of the State Council.
   One constitutional amendment guarantees the rights and interests
of the 21.5 million Chinese now working in 13.7 million private
businesses. Private entrepreneurs, operating small food and
clothing stalls and restaurants, now account for almost 13 percent
of the nation's total retail sales.
   The other amendment, also tied to China's policy of giving
greater flexibility to its economy, states that ``the right to the
use of land may be transferred according to law.''
   China has experimented with transfer of land-use rights as part
of efforts to provide land to more ambitious farmers and accelerate
urban development.
   China's foreign policy is not expected to change under Qian, a
career diplomat who spent 10 years in the Soviet Union and has
headed China-Soviet normalization talks since 1982. Qian, who also
has been China's spokesman on disarmament issues, speaks English
and Russian.
   Under Wu, foreign minister since November 1982, China has
maintained a course of neutrality in superpower disputes, increased
economic and political ties with the West, eased tensions with
Moscow and championed Third World causes.
   Qin Jiwei, a close confidante of Deng Xiaoping who served under
Deng in the wars against Japan and the Nationalists, is expected to
lead efforts to restore the Defense Ministry's authority over the
People's Liberation Army.
   Among other major appointments, Premier Li took over the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, which is responsible for
setting guidelines for China's market-oriented reforms. Vice
Premier Yao Yilin was confirmed as head of the State Planning
Commission, newly created out of two commissions.
   Li and Yao are both regarded as more cautious than party head
Zhao toward reforms designed to substitute central planning with
market-determined production. Their leadership over the two key
economic commissions could slow down the pace of new reform
initiatives in coming years.
   Li Senmao, 58, was named railways minister to succeed Ding
Guangen, who was forced to resign last month following a string of
fatal accidents. Li has been vice minister since 1982.
   Li Guixian, a Soviet-trained engineer who was party chief in
Anhui province, was named governor of the People's Bank of China,
succeeding Chen Muhua, one of the highest-ranking women in the
government.

   A woman in a see-through, fish-net body suit
disrupted traffic, caused several near-wrecks and ended up being
arrested, authorities said.
   Police said Dolly May Jane McCloud, 21, of East Peoria, was
arrested Saturday on charges of public indecency and disorderly
conduct, as well as obstructing police, authorities said.
   According to police, an unidentified driver reported several
motorists nearly collided when they suddenly slowed to look at Ms.
McCloud.
   Police Sgt. Phillip Benne said Ms. McCloud was wearing a
see-through, fish-net body suit that exposed her chest. She was
covered by other clothes from the waist down, Benne said.
   Benne said he saw three motorists slam on their brakes, honk
their horns and wave at Ms. McCloud, who was taken to the Peoria
County Jail and released after posting $100 cash bond. She is
scheduled to appear in court on May 2.

   Here are brief sketches of some of the new
members of China's Cabinet appointed today by the National People's
Congress.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Defense Minister Qin Jiwei</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Qin, a veteran general and protege of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, is expected to increase the ministry's role in making
military decisions, long handled by the party.
   Qin, 74, commander of the Beijing Military Region, is a veteran
of the 1934-35 Long March, the Communist forces' epic retreat
during the Chinese civil war. In 1946-49 he served as an army
officer under Deng's command and later commanded troops in the
Korean War.
   He replaces the ailing Zhang Aiping, 80. Real power in the
military, however, long has resided in the Communist Party's
Central Military Commission, headed by Deng.
   The Defense Ministry has been deliberately kept weak since 1971,
when then-Defense Minister Lin Biao allegedly plotted a coup
against Mao Tse-tung. Western military analysts believe the
leadership plans to reduce the party's military role to setting
overall policy and strengthen the Defense Ministry as part of its
efforts to make the military more professional and modern.
   Qin was born in 1914 in central China's Hubei province, and
joined the party in 1930. He was purged during the far-leftist
Cultural Revolution that began in 1966, and was rehabilitated in
1973.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Foreign Minister Qian Qichen</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Qian, 60, is a career diplomat who has headed China's border
talks with the Soviet Union and had been vice foreign minister
since 1982. He succeeds Wu Xueqian, who was promoted to vice
premier.
   Qian, who speaks English and Russian, studied in Moscow from
1954 to 1955 and was second secretary and counselor at the Chinese
Embassy in Moscow in the 1960s. He spent a total of 10 years in the
Soviet Union from 1954 to 1974, according to his official biography.
   In 1974, he became ambassador to Guinea and Guinea-Bissau in
northwest Africa. He returned to Beijing to become head of the
Foreign Ministry's Information Department.
   When China began talks with the Soviet Union in 1982 over their
disputed border, Qian was appointed to head negotiations. After 11
rounds, neither side has reported significant progress.
   Qian was born in the northeast industrial city of Tianjin in
1928 and joined the Communist Party in 1942. He worked for the
party's underground while reporting for the Ta Kung Pao newspaper
in Shanghai during the 1040s.
   He is a member of the party's policy-making Central Committee.

<HEAD>People's Bank of China Governor Li Guixian</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Li, a provincial party leader with little experience in finance,
was the surprise choice to fill the difficult post of governor of
the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.
   The 50-year-old Li, a Soviet-trained engineer who since 1986 has
been party secretary in Anhui Province, also became one of nine
state councilors named by the National People's Congress.
   He succeeds Chen Muhua, 67, one of China's most visible and
powerful women politicians, who had held the post for three years.
Chen was elected vice chairwoman of the National People's Congress,
China's legislature.
   Li takes over the bank at a critical stage as it tries to change
from exercising administrative control over the banking system to
adopting indirect controls through interest rates and credit.
   It also is promoting interbank markets, making greater use of
bonds and foreign credit to finance China's development and trying
to rein in excessive growth in money supply.
   Li, a native of Liaoning province, spent about five years in the
Soviet Union beginning in 1960 studying electric vacuum chemistry.
   After returning to China, he worked in the Ministry of Public
Security and between 1967 and 1976 was a technician, deputy
director and chief engineer of a large factory.
   He later was chief engineer of the Liaoning Provincial
Electronics Industry Bureau, deputy governor of Liaoning, and in
1985 became party secretary of the northeastern province.

<HEAD>Railways Minister Li Senmao</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Li faces the daunting task of resolving problems of aging
equipment and sloppy discipline that have contributed to four fatal
train accidents this year.
   Li, 58, became vice minister of the Railways Ministry in 1982
and has been acting foreign minister since early March. It is his
first Cabinet post.
   Ding Guangen, Li's predecessor, resigned in disgrace to take
responsibility for three train accidents in January, which killed a
total of 141 people.
   A few weeks later, 28 people were killed in the fourth accident,
the collision of two passenger trains in Shanghai.
   Investigations revealed deep-seated problems in the Railways
Ministry's administration, including the lack of a safety control
system, serious overloading of trains, outdated equipment, loose
discipline, poor worker training and frequent thefts of railway
materials.
   Li was a member of the Communist Party's 12th Central Committee
but was downgraded last October to an alternate membership in the
policy-making body when it was reduced from 210 members to 175.

<HEAD>Cabinet Leader Promises Flexibility For American Firms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cabinet minister said Panama will
be flexible with American companies caught between local law and
U.S. economic sanctions aimed at ousting the nation's strongman,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In another development, hundreds of teachers peacefully
demonstrated on Monday, chanting ``We don't want communism!'' and
``Pineapple-face, you must go!'' a reference to Noriega's jowly,
pockmarked face.
   The teachers demonstrated more than two hours at the Ministry of
Education Monday, demanding to be paid. Opposition leaders plan
daily demonstrations throughout the week, even though recent
protests in the 10-month campaign by the opposition to oust Noriega
have been poorly attended or blocked by police.
   The problem faced by U.S. companies was discussed Monday by
Commerce and Industries Minister Mario Rognoni at a meeting with 30
representatives of American companies.
   ``The way the act has come out, if they comply with the
Panamanian laws they are defying the American law and if they
comply with the American law they are defying the Panamanian law.
We hope to find a medium solution,'' he said.
   On Friday, President Reagan invoked a law banning Americans and
U.S. companies from making tax and other payments to the government.
   Noriega, head of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces and the
power behind the civilian government, is under separate indictments
by two federal grand juries in Florida on narcotics trafficking
charges.
   The United States recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as Panama's
president. Reagan ordered the tax payments to be directed into an
escrow account set up for Delvalle, who was deposed in February
after trying to fire Noriega.
   The order was the latest in a string of economic sanctions
enacted by the Reagan administration in a bid to force Noriega to
step down.
   Rognoni said the government is looking for ways to keep American
companies operating in Panama, where U.S. investment totals about
$3.5 billion.
   Much depends on how Washington interprets the law, he said.
   ``We are sad that the measures are going to affect American
companies that have been traditionally friends of Panama, that have
been part of our development,'' Rognoni said. ``They have been with
us many decades, some of them from the start of our country.''
   Fred Denton, executive director of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Panama City, said Rognoni made no threats against
American companies.
   The Treasury Department is expected to issue clearer guidelines
and exceptions to the order soon.
   The United States previously ordered $50 million in Panamanian
funds frozen in American banks, provoking an economic crisis that
has kept Panamanian banks closed since March 3.
   The government has failed to meet public payrolls for over a
month. Panamanians with paychecks have been unable to cash them or
gain access to their savings.
   Panamanian industry could be ``virtually paralyzed'' within two
months because of the bank closures, said Carlos Valencia,
president of the Panama Industrial Association.
   He said half the country's industry already was idle and
construction had halted. The only industries that could expect to
continue operating under current conditions were those that relied
upon domestic raw materials or were producing essential food and
beverage items, Valencia said.
   Noriega's departure as head of the military and the
democratization of Panama are essential conditions to solve the
crisis, he said.

   The dollar was little changed against most major
foreign currencies in light European trading early today. Gold
prices rose.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to trade within a narrow
range before Wednesday's meeting of finance ministers from the
seven major industrialized democracies and the release of U.S.
trade figures for February on Thursday.
   Few traders predicted any sharp improvement in the merchandise
trade deficit from January's shortfall of $12.44 billion.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to a closing 126.50 Japanese yen from
125.71 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it edged up to
126.53 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.6853 West German marks, down from 1.6855
   _1.3957 Swiss francs, up from 1.3953
   _5.7180 French francs, up from 5.7145
   _1.8897 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8910
   _1,249.75 Italian lire, up from 1,249.50
   _1.2390 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.848 from $1.856 late
Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $450.50 a troy ounce, up
from $449.50 bid late Monday. At mid-morning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $450.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $450.20, up from $449.00 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $452.21
from $451.95 at Monday's close.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.44 a troy
ounce, up from a $6.42 bid late Monday.

<HEAD>Shrimper Describes 12-Day Ordeal in Gulf of Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRYSTAL RIVER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boater who spent 12 days drifting
in the Gulf of Mexico without food or water wanted to see his
5-year-old daughter before he died, but perished hours before
rescuers arrived, said a friend who survived.
   Timothy Daniels, 19, describing the ordeal shared by him and
Jimmie Lee Thacker from his hospital bed in this Gulf Coast city on
Monday, said he had daydreams about grape soda and ice cream while
adrift.
   Daniels, who was rescued Saturday, was in stable condition today
after being moved out of the intensive care unit at Seven Rivers
Community Hospital. He was being treated for hypothermia, sunburn,
starvation and dehydration, said a nursing supervisor who asked
that her name not be used.
   Thacker, 25, died late Friday or early Saturday.
   ``All I know is that he wanted to see his little girl again
before he died,'' said Daniels, a shrimper. Thacker was separated
from his wife and 5-year-old girl, who live in Virginia.
   The ordeal began March 28, when Daniels and Thacker went to
Anclote Key, an island north of Tarpon Springs, in a 14-foot skiff
with two friends.
   At dusk, Daniels and Thacker left the island to get matches and
more soft drinks. They never came back.
   Their friends got back to the mainland the next morning by
hitching a ride from a passing fisherman and told family members
about the disappearence, prompting a Coast Guard search the next
day. The searchers gave up a week later.
   Daniels said the shore was out of sight when the boat lost
power. They drifted south and west, and lost their bearings.
   All he and Thacker had to drink were two bottles of Pepsi, which
they emptied the first night so they could use them to bail out the
boat after it was drenched by 16-foot waves.
   ``I didn't use my head. I freaked out,'' Daniels said. ``I could
have used the engine cover'' to bail.
   Desperate for water, Daniels daydreamed and used saltwater to
rinse his mouth. He said he spent much of his time praying.
   On several occasions, porpoises came to the boat and lifted
their snouts, apparently to see if the men had any fish for them.
   ``Seeing the porpoises made me feel better,'' Daniels said.
   When they had been adrift for several days, a big shrimp boat
came into view.
   Believing help had finally come, Daniels picked up the engine
box and began waving it frantically to get the other boat's
attention. ``I was yelling and hollering at the top of my lungs and
everything,'' he said.
   But the other boat didn't approach.
   ``It just kept going,'' Daniels said. ``One person on board
raised his hand and waved as the boat pulled away.''
   Daniels was rescued when a charter boat spotted him 14 miles
west of Crystal River.
   Despite his experience, he said he's looking forward to getting
back to work on the Gulf.
   ``It's my home away from home,'' Daniels said. ``It's how I make
my living.''

south Texas this morning, prompting a warning to Texans that they
protect pets, plants and pipes.
   Rain and thunderstorms extended from Mississippi to Alabama,
northern Georgia and South Carolina. In Mobile, Ala., sleet mixed
with rain.
   Skies were generally cloudy from southern New England to the
central Appalachians and were fair over much of the rest of the
nation.
   In south Texas, the chill prompted a freeze warning for the Hill
Country. It was an unseasonably low 39 degrees in San Antonio.
   Gale warnings remained in effect along Texas' upper Gulf Coast,
but the winds were expected to diminish.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Carolinas to northeast Florida, Tennessee, eastern Kentucky,
southern West Virginia and southwest Virginia; clouds over the
central Atlantic Coast and the central Gulf Coast states and sunny
skies over the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 40s and 50s from New
England to New Jersey, the northern Appalachians and the Great
Lakes; low 80s over southern Texas; 80s and 90s from southwest
Texas to the desert Southwest, and much of California and 60s and
70s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 23
degrees at Houlton, Maine, to 74 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   A mostly Mormon jury will sit in judgment
of four members of a renegade polygamist clan charged in the
bombing of a Mormon chapel and the subsequent 13-day standoff with
police.
   Federal prosecutors plan to call at least 150 witnesses,
including a Mormon bishop, neighbors of the defendants and
reporters, in the high-profile case beginning today.
   Defense lawyers, however, aren't sure it can be judged fairly.
   Attorney Fred Metos, asked if the 12 jurors seated Friday, truly
were the defendants' peers, responded, ``They have no peers.''
   A Utah correction officer was killed in an exchange of gunfire
at the end of the siege. The Utah attorney general's office plans
to file homicide charges as soon as the federal trial ends, said
Associate Attorney General Paul Warner.
   The trial will be one of the most closely followed in recent
memory in a state with an estimated 30,000 members of polygamist
families. Most coexist peacefully with their Mormon neighbors, who
make up nearly 70 percent of Utah's population.
   The Mormon Church renounced polygamy in 1890 and now
excommunicates advocates and practitioners of multiple-wife
marriages.
   The four defendants include Vickie Singer, 44, mother of seven
and widow of slain polygamist John Singer, who was gunned down in
1979 by police serving a contempt citation at the same farm where
his family held authorities at bay while awaiting the dead
patriarch's resurrection.
   Law enforcement officers believe Mrs. Singer was the brains
behind the bombing and standoff, while her son-in-law, Addam Swapp,
provided the muscle.
   According to Mrs. Singer's diary, submitted as evidence during
pretrial hearings, Swapp and two others planted the bomb at the
Kamas Stake Center in Marion on Jan. 16 as the Singer women prayed
at the family home two miles away.
   Swapp, 27, and Mrs. Singer are charged with seven and eight
counts, respectively, in a nine-count indictment that was handed up
shortly after their arrests. It was reduced last week to eight
counts when U.S. District Judge Bruce S. Jenkins dismissed a
conspiracy charge.
   Charged with four counts each are Jonathan Swapp, 21, Addam
Swapp's brother, and John Timothy Singer, Mrs. Singer's 21-year-old
wheelchair-bound son. Singer is state authorities' prime suspect in
the slaying of the corrections officer.
   All four defendants are charged with the attempted killing of
FBI agents during the standoff, assault on federal officers and two
firearms violations.
   Mrs. Singer and Swapp are charged additionally with using an
explosive to damage the chapel, use of a bomb and possession of a
bomb. Mrs. Singer also faces one count of possession of a sawed-off
shotgun.
   In telephone calls to news organizations shortly after the
bombing, Mrs. Singer and Swapp said the blast was symbolic of the
``collapse of the church, state and nation'' that would occur with
the second coming of Christ and the return of John Singer.
   Clan members contend Singer's death was the result of a
``government-church conspiracy'' and a ``long train of abuse''
against the family.
   Addam Swapp's attorneys asked that the trial be moved out of
state, arguing their client could not receive a fair hearing in
Mormon-dominated Utah.
   While Jenkins has not ruled on the motion, John Bucher, an
attorney for Swapp, said Monday the case probably would not be
transferred once the trial begins.
   Bucher and Metos, representing John Timothy Singer, said the
pool of 170 prospective jurors that reported for possible court
duty last week was 90 percent Mormon.

<HEAD>Thais Deny Weapons Smuggled On Hijacked Plane In Bangkok</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Hijack, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investigator today ruled out the
possibility that the hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner smuggled their
weapons on board the plane in Bangkok through a ramp area used by
service personnel.
   The possibility was raised on Monday by Rodney Wallis, head of
security for the Montreal-based International Air Transport
Association.
   The Kuwaiti jet was carrying 112 people when it was hijacked
April 5 on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait and forced down in Iran.
   The hijackers, who are armed with grenades and handguns, later
forced the plane to Larnaca, Cyprus, where they have killed two of
the approximately 50 passengers they are still holding hostage.
   ``It is not possible,'' Group Capt. Anake Udit said today when
asked about Wallis' theory. Anake, a deputy managing director of
the Airports Authority of Thailand, is a member of a team
investigating what happened during the 15 hours the Kuwait Airways
jumbo jet was on the ground in Bangkok.
   ``Anyone going through the ramp area had to go through tough
security clearance,'' Anake said in a telephone interview. ``That
is not easy.''
   On Monday, Wallis said: ``On the basis of discussions we've had
so far, the probability is that weapons were placed on board the
aircraft through the coercion or collusion of staff on the ramp.''
   The International Air Transport Association is an international
association of commercial airlines.
   Anake said Kuwait Airways hires guards from the airport
authority and from a private security firm to guard its planes
while in Bangkok. ``The security men do not take their eyes off the
plane once it landed,'' he said.
   Anake said the airport authority has not discussed the origin of
the weapons with the Air Transport Association. ``We expected
suppositions like this and we're saying (the weapons) didn't come
from here.''
   Thai investigators have theorized that the weapons were smuggled
aboard before the plane reached Bangkok on April 4 from Kuwait.
They said the hijackers may have left the weapons on board during
the stop.
   On the possible coercion or collusion of staff on the ramp,
Anake said: ``It was more likely they (the hijackers) used their
own people.''
   He said airport authority investigators were questioning about
100 people, including guards of the private security company and
airport authority personnel, including cleaners, mechanics,
engineers and employees of the Bangkok Airport Fuel Service.
   Anake said he could not say when the probe would be completed.
   A separate investigation team is headed by Interior Minister
Prachuab Suntrangkoon.

<HEAD>Thatcher Introduces Radical Changes In Welfare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing subsidies and most free school meals have
ended for needy Britons under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
revamping of Britain's 43-year-old welfare system, the latest
target in her war against socialism.
   Pensioners presented a petition at Mrs. Thatcher's Downing
Street office after the changes went into effect Monday.
   The legislation allowing the changes was approved 18 months ago.
But the implementation of the program has rekindled outcries among
opposition legislators and social welfare groups.
   Legislators from Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party expected
renewed opposition when Parliament resumes today.
   The changes affect 8.6 million people, including 1 million of
the poor whose housing subsidies will end. But Thatcher said Monday
that the plan would raise benefits for low-income working families
and give disabled people higher payments.
   Under the plan, most free school meals are taken away and most
grants with which the needy can buy beds and stoves have been
changed to interest-free loans.
   Revamping of the welfare system is the third part of a Thatcher
government program that has curbed state spending and greatly
reduced the power of labor unions.
   ``For us, the quality of life has just slipped a notch,'' said
Reg White, 73, a retired carpenter whose benefits drop by about $5
a week.
   He and his wife, Katherine, live in a subsidized apartment in
Kingston, outside London. Most of their $173.50 weekly income is
from state pensions, which remain the same, but cuts in housing
subsidies leave the couple worse off.
   Critics in the socialist Labor Party accuse Mrs. Thatcher of a
fundamental attack on the welfare state, established by a Labor
administration in 1945 and expanded by every government since.
   Mrs. Thatcher says she is not cutting the $86 billion welfare
bill, which represents is one-tenth of the nation's gross national
product, but refocusing it on the truly needy.
   John Moore, secretary for social services, says the idea is to
wean Britons from the ``dependency culture.'' Some may lose their
free stoves and beds, the argument goes, but $750 million is
reserved for those prepared to hold low-paid jobs rather than
depend only on welfare.
   ``Your targets are nonsense,'' Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock
declared in an angry exchange with the prime minister in the House
of Commons. ``Your `reform' is often a little extra to the very
worst-off, paid by those who are the next worst-off. The result
will inevitably be a spread of poverty.''
   While a poor family such as the Whites loses about $5 a week,
taxes for an executive making the equivalent of $187,000 a year
fall by $65 a day.
   Mrs. Thatcher said welfare expenditure would rise next year by
about $3.75 billion, and added:
   ``What you're saying is that you can never, ever have a
restructuring of social security if anyone loses. That's an
absolutely ridiculous thing to say.''
   Bishop David Jenkins of Durham, fourth-ranking prelate in the
Church of England, described the welfare reform as ``verging on the
wicked.''
   Conflicting statistics abound. Mrs. Thatcher says only 12
percent of claimants will be worse off but the government-appointed
Social Security Advisory Committee puts it at 43 percent, with 38
percent better off.
   Most of those affected, about one-seventh of Britain's 56
million people, are individuals or families whose incomes are from
welfare, state pensions or weekly wages ranging from about
$150-$225. The average weekly wage in Britain is $450, and basic
welfare for a childless unemployed couple remains at $99 a week.

   A series of explosions and a fire at an oil
field supply manufacturing plant early today forced the evacuations
of nearby residents, authorities said.
   Two plant employees suffered minor injuries, and were treated
and released at a Fort Worth hospital.
   The explosion was at the Owens Tool Co., located between Godley
and Cresson, about 25 miles southwest of Fort Worth.
   Authorities said they ordered the evacuations of about 30 people
from a square mile of the mostly rural area around the plant
because they believed 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of explosives were
stored in the area.
   Dean Owens, the plant's owner, said a charge being manufactured
for use in oil drilling operations exploded, triggering other
explosions and a fire. The plant was destroyed, he said.
   Firefighters from several surrounding towns, and volunteers
battled the blaze, but were pulled back at times because of fears
of possible additional explosions.
   The evacuees were taken to the Godley Fire Department, where
they were told to wait until it was safe to return home.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford has joined those who
want the May 17 recall election canceled on grounds she shouldn't
have to risk removal when the recall was aimed at her predecessor,
the ousted Evan Mecham.
   The Arizona Supreme Court was scheduled to hear arguments today
on a taxpayers' lawsuit that seeks cancellation of the special vote.
   Holding the election would ``provide that Governor Mofford could
be removed from office by virtue of recall petitions aimed against
Governor Mecham,'' according to a legal brief filed Monday by Mrs.
Mofford's attorney, David Campbell.
   ``The Constitution does not provide for removal of the governor
by a recall aimed at her predecessor,'' Mrs. Mofford's brief said.
Mecham was removed from office April 4 after an impeachment
conviction by the Senate, and Mrs. Mofford was sworn in the next
day.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin, defending acting Secretary of State
Karen Osborne in the suit, contended last week that nothing in the
Constitution permits the cancellation of a recall election once it
has been scheduled.
   Democrat Carolyn Warner's lawyer also filed a brief Monday
urging that the election be called off. Mrs. Warner, who had been
campaigning for the job, has said she will ask that her name be
removed from the ballot if Mrs. Mofford is allowed to run.
   But Republican candidates John Rhodes and Jack Londen and
independent John Oertle Sr. filed papers saying the recall should
be held because the people who signed petitions indicated they want
to choose their next governor.
   Mecham's spokesman, Norman Martin, said the former governor was
not filing papers in the case. However, he said that if the court
rules the recall must be held, Mecham expects to file suit in an
effort to get his name reinstated on the ballot. Ms. Osborne last
week removed Mecham's name after Corbin said he is not entitled to
run because he is no longer governor.
   Mrs. Mofford's brief contended she should not have to face
removal from office so soon after taking over the governorship.
   ``Governor Mofford has not been impeached,'' Campbell's brief
said. ``Neither has anyone circulated petitions demanding her
recall. Indeed, no such petitions could be circulated because she
has held office for only one wweek.''
   The constitution requires a public official to be in office for
at least six months before a recall petition campaign can be
started.
   Mrs. Mofford's name was put on the ballot following a draft
campaign, and she has thus far avoided declaring her own candidacy
for fear of running afoul of Arizona's ``resign to run'' law.
   Mrs. Warner's petition said the recall should be canceled
because ``those individuals who signed recall petitions were
specifically petitioning to recall the then-Gov. Evan Mecham from
office.'' She also noted that if the recall were held and Mrs.
Mofford were beaten by another candidate, she would not be entitled
to return to her former position as secretary of state.
   A petition filed by Rhodes' attorney said it would be ``an abuse
of discretion'' for Ms. Osborne to cancel the recall election.
   Londen's brief said he already had spent more than $200,000 for
his candidacy on billboards, television ads, literature and staff.
   Oertle's brief said that canceling the vote would violate his
constitutional right to hold office.

   New billboards will soon be appearing along
China's road to a modern economy.
   Zhao Guihong, general manager for the China's National Outdoor
Advertising Agency, and Gerard P. Joyce, president of Patrick Media
Group, announced Monday that the firm would become a consultant to
China on billboards.
   China's consumers are very brand conscious, and companies that
want to sell in China must make their products visible, Joyce said.
Outdoor advertising represents about 25 percent of the advertising
dollar in China, compared to less than two percent in the United
States, he said.
   ``Our guests are seeking to learn more about marketing, advanced
creative and construction techniques, operations and current
research and development,'' Joyce said.
   Zhao, leading a five-member Chinese delegation on an eight-day,
six-city tour of Patrick Media's outdoor displays, plants and
facilities, said he looks forward to an informative and productive
long-term relationship with Patrick Media.

   A security company executive who left
a note behind saying he knew he was making a mistake is missing
along with $1.3 million.
   The money had been kept in a safe that could not be opened until
two days after John Anthony Quinn disappeared, Palm Beach County
sheriff's Lt. Gary Hill said Monday.
   Quinn disappeared Saturday after leaving the notefor his family.
   ``He said (in his note) he was making a mistake and he knew
it,'' Hill said. ``But he loved his family and hoped they would
forgive him and understand some day.''
   Quinn, 48, was vice president and general manager of Federal
Protection Services Inc., a security company with an armored car
division that transports money.
   Worried family members and co-workers called police Sunday after
spending more than 24 hours searching for Quinn.
   ``When the (security office) safe released, we discovered money
was missing and our theories about what happened to him were
confirmed. We have several leads to where he might have gone but
nothing positive,'' Hill said.
   Quinn's company car was found in the parking lot at Palm Beach
International Airport.
   Quinn was one of the few employees with access to the safe's
combination. Deputies said that worn cash scheduled to be destroyed
had been stored in the safe. They said the money _ in bills ranging
from fives to hundreds _ probably could not be traced.
   Quinn had been dogged by financial problems, and the Internal
Revenue Service had put liens on his wages and personal property,
deputies said.

   A Conservative Party leader criticized Prince
Charles' outspokenness on social issues, saying the 39-year-old
future monarch's ``problem'' is he's never been allowed to take
responsibility for anything.
   Norman Tebbit, former chairman of the governing party and seen
as a potential successor to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said
the prince sympathizes with the jobless, for example, because ``in
a way he's got no job.''
   Tebbit made the remarks during a British Broadcasting Corp.
documentary called ``Charles, Prince of Conscience,'' broadcast
Monday, which outlined the controversy surrounding the prince's
forthright comments and his reported dissatisfaction with a life of
protocol and polo.
   The monarch is constitutionally barred from political
involvement, and other members of the royal family traditionally
refrain from commenting on politically sensitive topics.
   The eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, however, often has spoken
out about inner-city decay, conditions of the poor and jobless, and
architecture. His stands on stimulating inner cities have
reportedly differed from the government's and irritated Mrs.
Thatcher.
   Opposition Labor Party politicians criticized Tebbit's remarks
as ``foolish,'' saying they indicated Mrs. Thatcher's government
was trying to stifle criticism.
   Two major newspapers, in editorials Monday based on
pre-broadcast reports of the interview, also defended Charles.
   In the BBC program, Tebbit said Charles' outspoken comments
would be dangerous only if ``he went too far, if he advocated a
socialist solution, a Labor Party solution.''
   But when asked if he saw a risk in Charles' outspokenness,
Tebbit said, ``Perhaps it is a sign of his own impatience with his
own life, which is very restrictive in what he can do and say.''
   ``Now, whether his judgment is always right or not, well, we all
have our opinions about that,'' said Tebbit, who left the Cabinet
to care for his wife. Mrs. Tebbit was severely injured a 1985 Irish
Republican Army bombing.
   He said, ``any criticism (by Charles) of the world as it is
sounds like a criticism of the government.''
   ``I suppose the Prince of Wales naturally feels extra sympathy
towards those who've got no job,'' Tebbit said, ``because in a way
he's got no job and he's prohibited from having a job until he
inherits the throne.''
   Although approaching middle age, the prince has ``not been able
to take responsibility and authority for anything,'' he said. ``I
think that is really his problem.''
   Charles, in a BBC interview last year, said ``it would be easier
to lead a quieter life'' but that he was ``driven'' to try to help
the poor.
   ``I don't need to do this, but I feel strongly about a lot of
these things and I cannot do nothing about it,'' said Charles, who
heads several programs to help the poor and disadvantaged youths.
   On architecture, Charles called one planned museum addition ``a
monstrous carbuncle'' and dubbed another planned building ``a glass
stump.'' In both cases the plans were scrapped.
   While many have applauded Charles's criticisms, some architects
have complained that as a man who is neither elected nor possessed
of any architectural qualifications, he has no right to make such
attacks.
   Most recently, he rekindled controversy surrounding his position
by telling journalists he ``was determined not to be confined to
cutting ribbons,'' The New York Times reported in February.
   Palace officials have stoutly denied that the 62-year-old queen
will abdicate to allow her son to become king.
   Jack Cunningham, Labor Party spokesman on the environment,
called Tebbit's comments ``clearly foolish and almost offensive.''
   He said he believed the public wanted their future monarch to
understand their problems and the prince ``is demonstrating a real
concern for the people of this country.''
   Opposition lawmaker Bruce Grocott accused Tebbit of trying to
silence such voices of opposition as trade unions and local
government and ``it seems now he is trying to intimidate'' the
monarchy as well.
   Public opinion polls have shown support for the prince's action
and some desire even more outspokenness. A February survey in The
Mail, a London newspaper, found 57 percent of the 1,086 adults
asked said Charles should spend most of his time speaking out on
controversial subjects.

<TEXT>
   A reputed Mexican drug king was ordered held
without bail on a 1980 narcotics indictment, while an indictment
charging another alleged trafficker with heading a worldwide drug
cartel was unsealed.
   Jose Contreras Subias appeared before U.S. Magistrate Joseph
Reichmann on Monday on an 8-year-old indictment for allegedly
selling cocaine to undercover narcotics agents.
   Contreras Subias, who had been a fugitive since escaping from a
Mexican jail in 1985, was captured April 1 in Salt Lake City.
   Authorities believe Contreras Subias was the right-hand man to
alleged Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, jailed in Mexico on
charges of murdering U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Enrique Camarena in 1985.
   Also Monday, Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, 42, who authorities
say ordered Camarena's murder, was named in a 14-count indictment
charging him with heading an organization that brought Colombian
cocaine into the United States via Mexico between May 1983 and June
1985.
   Matta Ballesteros was arrested by U.S marshals last week after
he was expelled from his native Honduras. The expulsion led to
student riots in Honduras that included setting fire to a U.S.
embassy annex there.
   Contreras Subias told Reichmann Monday that federal authorities
have the wrong man. He claimed he is actually Jose Gonzalez
Guillen, but prosecutors presented evidence that his fingerprints
matched those taken during a 1985 arrest in Los Angeles.
   He was scheduled to be arraigned in Los Angeles on Monday,
prosecutors said.
   Nine people have been indicted in the Camarena slaying, and
three are in custody, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmy Gurule.
Matta Ballesteros is considered one of four prime suspects, said
DEA chief John Lawn.
   According to the indictment, Matta Ballesteros shipped thousands
of pounds of South American cocaine to Mexico. The narcotics were
then flown to a remote air strip in Young, Ariz., and moved in
recreational vehicles to several ``safe houses'' in the Los Angeles
area, the indictment said.
   The drug ring owned four airplanes, rented homes in New York
City and Southern California and set up several corporations, the
indictment charged.
   The indictment also accused Matta Ballesteros of conspiracy,
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and running a
continuing criminal enterprise.

   With a car heading straight toward his
motorcycle, Wade Cross had only a split-second to think about the
best way to keep a wedding date with his fiancee.
   ``I knew there was no way we wouldn't hit,'' Cross said. ``The
only thing that came to mind was try to jump over the top.''
   He did, and ended up in a ditch with a broken arm and wrist, a
broken collarbone and shoulder, a pelvis broken in three places and
a broken heel and toe.
   Despite the injuries suffered in the accident Friday, and the
fact that he was in intensive care at Central Kansas Medical Center
with tubes going in and out of his body, Cross, 31, and Rita Webb,
35, were married Saturday.
   Interviewed Monday in his hospital room, Cross said the gist of
the ceremony was ``going after what you want in life and not
letting things stand in your wy.''
   Rita, now Mrs. Cross, joked that the only change in the ceremony
was ``for worse or for better'' rather than the other way around.
   Cross said he had just left the 4-H building north of Great Bend
where he, his fiancee and their family and friends had spent the
day putting up wedding decorations. He was heading back home on his
Harley-Davidson to pick up a camera to make pictures of their work.
   Cross said he was on U.S. 281 when he saw the car coming head-on
and knew there was no way to avoid a collision.
   Mrs. Cross said she and friends and relatives spent a long night
Friday in the intensive care unit.
   ``It was very serious all night long,'' she said.
   The next day the couple decided to go ahead with their wedding
plans. The Rev. Dick Ogel obliged.
   ``I admit I laughed a little when he said `kiss the groom,'''
said Mrs. Cross.

<TEXT>
   The Afghan accord to be signed this week
represents a rare victory for U.N. diplomacy in resolving regional
conflicts. It also indicates the limitations of the world body.
   The United Nations only is as good as its 159 members, only as
constructive as they allow it to be, only effective when the
superpowers embrace it.
   Nearly six years of intensive, intricate and innovative U.N.
diplomacy concerning the 10-year Afghan civil war finally paid off
because it was in every party's interest. There were 12 rounds of
Geneva talks and nine shuttle missions since 1981.
   Pakistan and Afghanistan have announced agreement on a package
of measures providing for the withdrawal of the estimated 115,000
Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The Marxist government of President
Najib has been backed by Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan since 1979.
   The guerrilla forces are based in Pakistan and armed primarily
by the United States. The Moslem guerrillas, who were not part of
the U.N.-mediated talks, have rejected the accords and said they
will press their fight to oust the Kabul government.
   The United Nations and its mediator, Diego Cordovez, played the
role of catalyst and broker. The negotiated accord is to be signed
Thursday in Geneva.
   A respected, neutral peacekeeper worldwide, the United Nations
will monitor the political settlement and Soviet withdrawal.
   Last-minute disagreement between the United States and Soviet
Union on cutting off aid to the guerrillas and the Kabul government
threatened to wreck the pact.
   A behind-the-scenes agreement between the superpowers,
guarantors of the Afghan accord, cleared the way for success.
   Diplomatic sources said the two powers tacitly agreed to cut off
aid to both sides or to provide an equal amount of supplies.
   The fundamental obstacle was cleared when the Soviet Union
decided that Afghan intervention was too costly _ in money, lives,
domestic politics and international image. Moscow then announced it
would withdraw its troops over a 10-month period begining May 15.
   No amount of U.N. diplomacy could achieve a breakthrough until
the Soviet Union was ready to leave, diplomats said.
   ``Diplomatic success is possible only when the moment is ripe,''
said Robert G. Neumann, former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and
now director of Middle East Studies at the Center For Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, D.C. ``But statesmen like
ambassador Cordovez have acted with great patience to ripen the
time,'' Neumann said on Monday in a telephone interview.
   Neumann, envoy in Kabul from 1966 to 1973, said the United
Nations had been hobbled because its charter prevents it from
interfering in domestic affairs. Soviet insistence on a coalition
government after its pullout had been an obstacle to political
settlement.
   When that stance was abandoned, the United Nations could act.
   Neumann said Cordovez ``provided a catalyst as the principal but
not the only actor since he was free to talk to all sides.''
   Cordovez says the complicated Afghan accord, which includes five
separate documents, could serve as a model for resolving other
regional conflicts.
   The United Nations faces numerous conflicts where its
resolutions and diplomatic missions have had little or no effect:
the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, Lebanon, Central America,
Vietnam and Cyprus.
   ``The U.N. is extremely useful as a central point to carry on
these kinds of negotiations, but it takes a lot of force from the
outside to succeed,'' said a former senior U.N. official familiar
with the Afghan talks.
   ``The U.N. has constructed a vehicle for peace in the hopes that
someone will use it,'' said the official, speaking on condition his
name not be used.
   ``The negotiating process itself is very valuable and keeps the
conflict from spinning out of control. This honest broker is
extremely important.''
   Because Pakistan and Afghanistan have no relations, their
representatives refused to meet face-to-face. Cordovez shuttled not
only between capitals but between rooms where the delegations met.
He continually briefed the United States and Soviet Union and also
met with Afghan guerrillas.
   Before the final round of talks, Cordovez told reporters:
   ``I am convinced that the parties to this accord, especially the
Soviet Union, are signing because they want to. It is in their
self-interest and for that reason they also should honor it.''
   ``The Soviet Union could stay in Afghanistan and they are not
going to be pushed out,'' Cordovez said. ``But a military solution
is not possible and the Soviets have agreed to a political solution
because they wish to.''

<TEXT>
   Here is some background on the hijackers
of the Kuwait Airways jetliner:
   WHO THEY ARE _ No identities have been disclosed. Arabs
listening to radio conversations between three of the hijackers and
the Larnaca Airport control tower say their accents indicate that
two are Lebanese, who recite from the Koran, Islam's holy book,
with Iranian inflections, and one is an Iraqi.
   There appears to be between five and seven Arab hijackers.
Bahrain authorities say the Bahraini passports carried by five
people in boarding the jumbo jetliner are forgeries.
   WHAT THEY WANT _ The hijackers main demand is the release of 17
terrorists, imprisoned in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies there in 1983. This is the same demand made by the
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Islamic Jihad, which is holding American
and French hostages in Lebanon. All but one of the 17 terrorists in
Kuwait are Shiite Moslems. Three have been sentenced to death.
   THEIR LINKS WITH LEBANON _ Two of the pro-Iranian, extremist
Shiite groups in Lebanon have threatened to kill hostages they hold
if the hijacked plane is stormed. Islamic Jihad threatened to kill
two Americans, Terry Anderson, The Associated Press' Chief Middle
East Correspondent, and educator Thomas Sutherland, along with at
least three French captives _ journalist Jean-Paul Kauffman and
diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine. The Shiite
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth threatened to kill U.S.
Marine Lt. Col William R. Higgins, kidnapped while serving with a
U.N. observer group in south Lebanon.
   The hijackers flew to Beirut on Friday, but Syrian forces
controlling the airport refused to let them land and the plane went
to Cyprus.
   THE IRAN CONNECTION _ The hijackers appear to be Shiite Moslems,
like most of Iran's 50 million people and its revolutionary leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The plane was initially forced to land
in northeast Iran.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran has condemned the
hijacking as ``against Islamic principles'', but Iran allowed the
plane to leave Friday after refueling it. The hijackers later sent
greetings to their ``Iranian brothers'' and spoke in a statement
Tuesday of the ``glory of the Imam Mahdi,'' a figure in Shiite
theology who is to reappear as the Messiah. This belief is peculiar
to Shiites.

   A bomb exploded early today outside a
Treasury Ministry office, slightly damaging a door and several
parked cars but causing no injuries, police said.
   Similar bombs placed outside doors of three other Treasury
Ministry offices in this northeastern city emitted smoke but failed
to go off, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for planting the
bombs, but police said they suspected Terra Lliure, a small
terrorist group that seeks independence for the four-province
northeastern region of Catalonia.
   Police said the bombing occurred just before 2 a.m. and
residents notified police of the other three bombs shortly
afterward.
   Barcelona is the largest city in the Catalonian region and
Spain's second-largest city.
   Terra Lliure, which stands for Free Land in the Catalan
language, has claimed numerous bombings in the region in the last
three years.

<HEAD>Nixon Says Shultz's Efforts Will Go for Nought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard M. Nixon said today
that only secret and prolonged negotiations can bring about a
change in U.S. relations with Israel and that George Shultz's
efforts will go for nought in an election year.
   ``You have to recongize that we can do nothing about those
relations in an election year,'' said Nixon. Israel, too, is
holding elections in 1988.
   In the secnd of three consecutive daily appearances on NBC's
``Today'' program, Nixon suggested that the United States use a
heavyweight negotiator, whom he did not name today. But on Sunday,
on NBC's ``Meet the Press'', he suggested Henry Kissinger for that
role.
   The former president, who is making public appearances to
promote a new book, ``1999,'' also touched on these subjects:
   _ On others' global responsibility: ``Unless the Europeans do
more in their own defense ... you are going to find the Congress is
going to reduce the American presence without getting anything for
it from the Russians.''
   _ On the next president: He ``is going to be urged, the moment
he gets in, to go running over to Moscow or have them come here. It
would be the greatest mistake he can make.'' Nixon suggested the
first summit meeting should be without glamour or spouses and
``should go on for at least two weeks and we should develop a
common strategy.''
   _ On China: ``China's first priority is progress at home.
They've given up on expansion and aggression abroad ... (Mikhail)
Gorbachev has to choose. If he can get progress at home and give
away aggression abroad, we can have the same relations with him
that we do with the Chinese.''
   Nixon said he gives Secretary of State Shultz high marks for his
shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East in recent weeks. ``But there
isn't enough time to do it this year and it cannot be done in an
election year. I don't want to say it's going to fail, because he's
going to continue to try, but I say that 1989 is the optimum year
to do it in.''
   The Israelis, said Nixon, should make their deal now ``because
they are going to find that time is not on the side of the
Israelis.''
   Asked what he thinks might restrain the sometimes brutal
behavior toward Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza, Nixon said:
   ``They must not ignore the problem. They must not be blind to
the fact that there are a million and a half Palestinians there who
don't have the right of self-government. And that's a time bomb
that's going to explode. They have to deal with that or they are
going to have great problems in the future.''

<HEAD>Archbishop Defends His Activism Against Criticism From Botha</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ In a stinging rebuke to
President P.W. Botha, Archbishop Desmond Tutu today denied that he
endorsed Marxism and said his fight against apartheid was deeply
rooted in Christian tradition.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in southern
Africa, released the text of a letter to Botha defending his
challenges of government policy in a church-state confrontation
that has intensified over the past two months.
   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was responding to a March letter
from Botha in which the South African president suggested Tutu was
furthering the cause of the African National Congress guerrilla
movement and promoting a Marxist dictatorship.
   Botha, whose letter was quoted at length on South African
television, asked whether Tutu was acting ``on behalf of the
kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the ANC.''
   Replied Tutu: ``I work for God's kingdom. For whose kingdom,
with your apartheid policy, do you work for?''
   ``I reject atheistic Marxism and I reject apartheid, which I
find equally abhorrent,'' said Tutu. He cited numerous scriptural
passages to support his contention that South Africa's policy of
racial separation is ``unbiblical, un-Christian, immoral and evil.''
   Referring to insinuations in Botha's letter, Tutu said he had
never listened to the ANC's radio broadcasts or read its magazine.
   ``My theological position derives from the Bible and the
teachings of the Church,'' Tutu wrote. ``The Bible and the Church
predate Marxism and the ANC by several centuries.''
   Tutu is presiding this week over a synod of Anglican bishops in
South-West Africa. South Africa administers the territory, also
known as Namibia, in violation of a U.N. resolution.
   Tutu also offered to debate the morality of apartheid with a
theologian from Botha's Dutch Reformed Church. Apartheid
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26.5 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs, but the 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.
   ``My position in this is not one of which I am ashamed ... I
know that I stand in the mainline Christian tradition,'' he added.
   Botha had chided Tutu for getting arrested, along with 25 other
church leaders, when they tried to march on Parliament six weeks
ago to protest the bannings of 17 major anti-apartheid
organizations and more than a dozen individuals.
   The clergymen have been trying to fill the political void
created by the crackdown.
   Tutu, who leaves Saturday on a five-week trip to Europe and the
United States, asked Botha to ensure that his reply to the
president was covered as prominently by state television as Botha's
March 16 letter to Tutu. He also accused the president of falsely
claiming that Tutu once preached under a communist banner.
   ``I pray for you, as I do for your ministerial colleagues, every
day by name,'' Tutu's letter concluded. ``God bless you.''

   The estate of murdered tobacco heiress
Margaret Benson should be shared equally by the children of the son
who killed her and by her daughter, a judge has ruled.
   The 63-year-old Pennsylvania tobacco heiress died when two pipe
bombs ripped apart her car apart on July 9, 1985, in front of her
North Naples home.
   Collier Circuit Judge Hugh D. Hayes issued the ruling Monday.
Through taxes, disbursements and attorney's fees, the estate has
dwindled from $10 million to about $1.2 million, said Carl Westman,
the estate's attorney.
   In August 1986, Margaret Benson's son, Steven Wayne Benson, was
convicted in the slaying of his mother and her adopted son, Scott
R. Benson, 21. Steven Benson is serving two life sentences at Union
Correctional Institution in Raiford, Fla.
   Attorneys representing Steven Benson, 36, and Margaret Benson's
daughter, Carol Lynn Benson Kendall, 43, said they both probably
will appeal Monday's ruling.
   Under Florida law, Steven Benson is precluded from receiving
proceeds of the estate of the person he murdered, Hayes said.
   Steven Benson's children _ Elizabeth Benson, 5; Christopher
Logan Benson, 5; and Natalie Nichole Benson, 4 _ are entitled to
inherit from their grandmother's estate, the judge said.

   Random House is planning to publish a modern
English translation of the Talmud that it hopes will make the
1,500-year-old collection of Jewish law, legend and philosophy more
accessible to laymen.
   The translator is Adin Steinsaltz, an Orthodox rabbi and noted
Talmud scholar. The project will be published in stages, with the
first three volumes expected by 1990.
   Steinsaltz, of the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications in
Jerusalem, said the effort may entail as many as 15 volumes and
take 10 years to complete.
   Peter Osnos, the Random House associate publisher who will edit
the project, said the volumes will probably cost $30 to $40 each.
   ``We have now possibly a major part of the Jewish people whose
native tongue is English,'' Steinsaltz said, ``and who really are
not comfortable in any other language.''
   The translation will be of the Babylonian Talmud, compiled in
the sixth century after Christ and considered more authoritative
than the shorter Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud.
   The University of Chicago Press has published 22 of a projected
36 volumes of the Jerusalem Talmud in English.

   U.S. evangelist Billy Graham today opened a
16-day tour of China, where he will preach and sightsee.
   ``This is my first time to set foot on Chinese soil,'' the
69-year-old Southern Baptist minister said on arrival. ``It's
something I have looked forward to and dreamed of all my life.''
   Graham, his wife, Ruth, and their eldest son came at the
invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with
Foreign Countries and the China Christian Council.
   The evangelist, who has preached in more than 60 countries,
including the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said he was visiting
as a tourist and pilgrim to his wife's birthplace. However, Graham
will preach in Chinese churches in Beijing and Shanghai and meet
with religious leaders and seminary scholars in Nanking and
Shanghai.
   Graham's wife, the daughter of missionaries, was born in Jiangsu
province in coastal China. She left China at the age of 17.
   The evangelist and his family were met at the Beijing airport by
former ambassador to the United States Zhang Wenjin, U.S.
Ambassador Winston Lord, and Bishop K.H. Ding, president of the
China Christian Council.
   There are 4 million Protestants in China who worship in 4,000
state-sanctioned churches. Millions more are believed to worship at
home.
   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, religion was banned and
believers persecuted. In recent years, China has allowed religious
life to resume under state control.
   Graham said his trip would bolster relations between the United
States and China and increase contacts between churches in the two
countries.
   Ding said Graham's visit ``will surely strengthen the witness of
Christ in China,'' but he said Graham's name is unknown to most
Chinese.

<HEAD>Dalai Lama Says Tibetans In Constant Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama, the self-exiled leader of
the Tibetan people, said today that Tibetans remain in constant
fear of the Chinese government which rules their homeland.
   However, he said, he is increasingly hopeful that a solution to
the Tibetan problem can be found.
   ``Many things are changing _ particularly in China _ things are
changing for the better, and generally speaking things are becoming
more humanized. That is a positive and hopeful sign,'' the Dalai
Lama told the Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders
on Human Survival, a gathering to discuss the planet's problems.
   The Dalai Lama is the spiritual and temporal leader of the
Tibetan people. He fled Tibet in 1959 after an aborted uprising
against Chinese rule.
   China claims that Tibet has been part of China for at least the
past 700 years. Many Tibetans claim that Tibet is an independent
state.
   Following a British stipulation, the Dalai Lama's 30-minute
speech eschewed politics, but when the 52-year-old Tibetan sat
down, a questioner asked whether the 200 conference participants
could help in any way to ``stop the suffering'' and restore Tibet's
religious and cultural freedom.
   The Dalai Lama thanked the questioner and said he was continuing
negotiations with China.
   China boycotted the conference in Oxford because of the Dalai
Lama's presence. In a letter to the Times of London, published
Tuesday, Chinese Ambassador Ji Chaozhu defended his country's rule
of Tibet.
   The letter welcomed the Dalai Lama's ``intention to continue
such contacts. Our only condition is that he does not demand
`independence' for Tibet, which we would never accept.''
   The unique gathering of 200 personalities from more than 60
countries is trying to find ways of using their influence with
national decision makers to tackle international issues like
nuclear war, population control, violence, pollution and
conservation.
   In the first keynote speech at the opening ceremony Monday in
Oxford city hall, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie admitted
that religious differences were still ``the root cause of tensions
and deep divisions between different human groups.''
   ``It is premature to presume that the age of holy wars is long
past,'' said Runcie, spiritual head of the state Church of England
and leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, including 3 million
U.S. Episcopalians.
   James Lovelock, a British scientist concerned with saving the
natural environment, said in a main theme speech prepared for
delivery today: ``We face the hard task of reintegrating creation _
of learning again to be part of the Earth and not separate from
it.''
   Lovelock, who with Lynn Margulis formulated the Gaia theory that
Earth itself is alive to the extent that it can regulate its
climate and chemical composition, said tropical forests which
helped to create the rain that sustains them, are being ``removed
at a ruthless pace.''

   Kuwait Airways today indefinitely

Thailand said.
   The manager, Elias H. Shiber, said he did not know whether the
decision was related to the hijacking of Kuwait Airways Flight 422.
No reason was given by the head office in Kuwait, he said.
   The plane was hijacked by armed men after it took off from
Bangkok for Kuwait on April 5.
   Shiber said that besides Thailand, the suspension affected
flights to and from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and the
Philippines.
   The last flight involving an Asian destination, he said, was
another Flight 422, which left Bangkok at 3 a.m. today for Kuwait.

   Iran today claimed its forces advanced
into northeast Iraq, killing or wounding more than 2,000 Iraqis and
capturing border highlands. Iraq said the assault was repulsed.
   Iraq reported it fired a long-range missile into Tehran and two
into the northwestern city of Tabriz. Shipping executives said Iran
attacked and set ablaze a Saudi Arabian tanker in the Persian Gulf.
   Iran said there were civilian casualties in the attacks on its
cities. It did not specify how many.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, claimed Iraqi warplanes today dropped chemical bombs on
Iranian troops in Sulaimaniyeh province as Iraq's forces were
losing ground in the latest offensive in the 7{-year-old war. IRNA
said Iranian troops were equipped with gas masks and protective
clothing, ``but many were injured.'' It did not elaborate.
   It said heavy fighting was raging after the Iranians overran 12
square miles of Iraqi territory. IRNA said Iranian jets twice
bombed a headquarters of the Iraqi Army's 1st Corps at Kani Mizan,
west of Penjwin, ``inflicting heavy damage,'' and carried out 25
combat missions against ground targets.
   IRNA said the Iranians advanced across the mountainous frontier
Monday night near Penjwin, seizing six ``strategic heights'' to
gain a foothold in the region. That is 25 miles north of an Iranian
bridgehead around Lake Darbandikhan seized in an offensive last
month.
   In Baghdad, the official news agency quoted an Iraqi military
spokesman as saying the latest Iranian assault was beaten back,
with 2,000 men killed or wounded. ``Many were captured while the
others fled,'' the unidentified spokesman was quoted as saying.
   There was no independent confirmation of either side's claims.
Iran and Iraq rarely allow correspondents into the battle zones.
   IRNA reported the advancing Iranians captured 235 Iraqis and
destroyed 45 tanks and armored personnel carriers, 1,000 vehicles
and 10 artillery guns. IRNA said gunners shot down an Iraqi PC-7
aircraft, a Swiss-built propellor-driven trainer that can be used
in a combat role.
   In Manama, Bahrain, shipping executives reported the raid on the
36,904-ton Sagheera, Iran's first attack on gulf shipping this
month.
   The tanker was hit at 1 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT) off the emirate of Ras
al-Khaimah in the southern gulf as it was sailing out of the
waterway with a full load of Saudi oil, said the executives,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The executives said the tanker's bow was set on fire.
   The Iranians challenged the Sagheera by radio, demanding its
destination and cargo, before it was attacked, the executives said.
   The Iraqi News Agency agency reported the Iraqis fired a
long-range missile into Tabriz today. Iran said the missile hit a
hospital for lepers, but said no reports on casualties was
available.
   IRNA reported on Monday that Iranian-backed Iraqi rebels have
killed 680 Iraqi soldiers and destroyed four bases in northeast
Iraq in the last few days.
   Iran said it fired two missiles at ``two key military targets''
in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Monday in retaliation for Iraqi
missiles that killed at least 20 civilians in Tehran and Isfahan
earlier in the day.
   IRNA reported that Iranian artillery also shelled the battered
the Iraqi port city of Basra, the naval base at Umm Qasr and three
border towns Monday.
   The agency quoted the Iranian defense minister, Brig. Gen.
Mohammed Hussein Jalali, as saying his country is now making most
of its own missiles and is capable of ``turning Baghdad into an
inferno ... if the criminal attacks on Iranian cities continue.''
   Since Feb. 29, the two sides have fired more than 300 missiles
into each other's cities.
   At the United Nations on Monday, Iraq's deputy foreign minister,
Wisam Alzahawi, said there is no point in continuing talks on
ending the Iran-Iraq war until Iran accepts a U.N. Security Council
peace plan.
   The Security Council passed a resolution in July 1987 demanding
an immediate cease-fire and troop withdrawal as the first steps
toward a negotiated end to the war. Iraq endorsed the resolution;
Iran has yet to do so.

   An injured man riding unattended in the
back of an ambulance fell out onto the road and had to hitchhike
the rest of the way to the hospital, Italian newspapers reported
today.
   The reports said Carmine Urciuolo, 23, a native of Avellino, 34
miles southeast of Naples, and the stretcher on which he lay fell
out of the ambulance because the driver had not correctly closed
the rear doors of the vehicle.
   Urciuolo had been injured in a traffic accident.
   Not until the ambulance reached the hospital emergency room did
the driver realize that the patient was no longer in the vehicle.
   Urciuolo hitchhiked to the hospital and was treated for minor
injuries.

   There may be some good news in store
for the salt marsh harvest mice that live in that soggy, swampy
land along Las Gallinas Creek.
   The city council is bruiting a ban on cats.
   The ban was proposed by city planners for a 224-home subdivision
near the creek because of fears that housepets would hunt the
endangered mice, which live only in the wetlands of the San
Francisco Bay area.
   The Planning Commission also fears cats might hunt clapper rail
birds, another endangered species.
   Under the measure, homeowners would be required to trap stray
cats that venture into the marshland.
   But the measure may encounter some opposition when it shows up
on the council agenda next week.
   ``It's ridiculous that the city's trying to restrict people from
having animals,'' said Councilman Gary Frugoli. ``We'll be the
laughingstock of everybody.''
   Richard Garlinghouse, a spokesman for Southwest Diversified
Inc., the developer of the housing project, called the cat ban a
``reasonable compromise'' with environmentalists.
   He said construction is expected to start this summer.
   But Pat Miller of the Marin County Humane Society said the ban
might be unenforceable.
   ``Dogs are hard enough to catch,'' she said.

   The principal of a Manhattan high school has
banned students from wearing the big gold jewelry he says is
responsible for three ``near-deaths'' at the school.
   Principal Edward Reynolds met students at the door of West Side
High as they returned from spring break. The ban includes gold
necklaces like thick rope, breast plates and medallions, rings with
three or four finger holes and earrings the size of door knockers.
   ``There have been three near-deaths at the school _ including an
incident with a gun in the gym _ over gold,'' Reynolds said.
   ``Most of the gold the kids wear is from drug money, theft or
buying of stolen gold,'' said Reynolds. ``Gold has become a symbol
of the street and all of the destructive values it represents.''
   Twelve years ago Reynolds banned jackets with gang colors at the
high school to decrease strife.
   Gold has taken the place of jackets, he said, with the most
popular styles being the Mercedes logo, studded with diamonds, and
an image of Jesus Christ affixed to an anchor.

<HEAD>50,000 Soviet Soldiers to Leave Within Three Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry official told Italian
parliamentarians today that 50,000 Soviet soldiers will be
withdrawn from Afghanistan within three months beginning May 15, an
Italian source said.
   The statement by First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov
appeared to be the first time an official source gave any
indication of the size of the Soviet force in Afghanistan.
   Under an accord to be signed Thursday in Geneva, the Soviet
Union will agree to remove all of its soldiers from Afghanistan
within nine months of May 15, the first half of them by Aug. 15.
   The figure provided by Vorontsov would make the size of the
Soviet force about 100,000 soldiers. Western sources have estimated
there are 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan, but the Soviets
never have provided a figure.
   The Italian source attended the meeting but spoke on condition
he not be further identified.
   Vorontsov told the group of eight Italian lawmakers that half of
the Soviet force would leave Afghanistan within three months, and
``he mentioned 50,000 soldiers,'' the source said.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev, speaking at a
regular news briefing today, said he could not give a figure for
the number of Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan.
   Perfilyev indicated that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who will
sign agreements to guarantee the Geneva accord, also may meet
separately to discuss other issues.
   Shultz will be in Moscow a week later to continue negotiations
for a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons, but ``it can't
be ruled out that there will be a meeting dealing with a broad
range of topics'' in Geneva, Perfilyev said.
   The Italian delegation that met with Vorontsov was headed by
Christian Democrat Flaminio Piccoli, president of the Foreign
Commission of the Italian Chamber of Deputies.
   Vorontsov did not provide any further details on the Soviet
forces in Afghanistan, but said that the soldiers would begin
taking up positions to begin withdrawing in a month, the Italian
source said.
   Vorontsov reportedly said nothing about the arming of pro-Soviet
Afghan government forces and Afghan guerrillas, who are supplied by
the United States and other countries.
   U.S.-Soviet disagreement over the future of that aid held up the
Geneva talks for several weeks before the two sides agreed that
they could continue supplying weapons.
   The United States had sought a symmetrical elimination of aid to
government forces and the Moslem guerrillas. But the Soviets
refused to go along, saying the United States interjected the
demand at the last minute and that Soviet Union could not violate
agreements with the Afghan government.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and
replaced one pro-Soviet government with another. They remained to
help government forces fight anti-Communist insurgents, many of
whom have bases in neighboring Pakistan.
   The guerrillas have rejected the accords and said they will
continue to fight to oust the Kabul government.

<HEAD>Convicted Rapist-Mutilator Seeks Victim's Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rapist who cut off his victim's
forearms says that when his parole ends April 25 he may visit
Oregon, where his mutilated victim was last known to be living.
   Lawrence Singleton, 60, who spent the first part of his parole
shuttling from town to town when no community would accept him,
said he plans to spend his ``first few days'' of freedom with a
church group in Oregon, the Antioch Daily Ledger reported Monday.
   He would not disclose the exact location and did not rule out a
return to California and Contra Costa County, east of San
Francisco. His victim, Mary Vincent, has said she is frightened
that Singleton could find her and harm her.
   Singleton, an ex-sailor, was convicted in 1979 of raping
Vincent, then 15, and chopping off her forearms on Sept. 29, 1978.
He was sentenced to a 14-year, four-month term but was released on
parole last year for good behavior and through work credits.
   He has spent the last 10 months of his year-long parole in a
mobile home on the grounds of San Quentin state prison. Gov. George
Deukmejian arranged for Singleton to live there following
confrontations with politicians and residents of communities who
did not want him in their cities.
   In July, state corrections officials considered allowing
Singleton to serve his parole with a farm family in Azalea, Ore.,
who wrote to California officials and offered Singleton a job as a
handyman. Oregon officials refused to grant permission for the move.
   Singleton did not say if he plans to live with the family, but
when his parole ends he will be able to live where he pleases.
   Vincent, interviewed after Singleton's parole, was reported by
the Modesto Bee to be living at an undisclosed location in southern
Oregon. She said at the time she was scared that Singleton would
find her and harm her again.
   With last year's protests in mind, authorities may take
Singleton to an undisclosed site in the state before releasing him,
said Ron Chun, regional director of the state Department of
Corrections.
   If Singleton lives anywhere in California, Chun said, he will
have to register as a sex offender within 10 days.
   Singleton continues to insist he did not attack Vincent,
portraying himself as a victim and the young woman as a drug-crazed
kidnapper.
   Singleton told the Daily Ledger he is seeking a criminal
investigation into his allegation that Vincent kidnapped him in
1978.
   ``(She) told me that if I did not comply with her wishes she
would poke out my eyes, smash my face, and hurt, hurt, hurt me and
say that I raped her,'' Singleton wrote in a request for Vincent's
arrest, a copy of which he gave to the Ledger.
   The typed request says Singleton picked up Vincent hitchhiking
in Berkeley and that she began smoking the drug PCP. He says they
picked up two male hitchhikers and that they and Vincent extorted
money from him. He left Vincent in Sacramento and never saw her
again, Singleton said.
   Singleton contends it was the hitchhikers who assaulted Vincent.
Authorities maintain the two hitchhikers never existed.

<TEXT>
   Teams from several state and federal
agencies searched today for a whale that swam about 70 miles up the
Delaware River, attracting flocks of boaters despite warnings it
could damage small craft.
   The 40-foot whale, first reported by a tugboat crew, was last
seen just before nightfall Monday at the Delaware Memorial Bridge,
which crosses the Delaware River about 25 miles south of
Philadelphia, officials said.
   Personnel from Delaware marine police, U.S. Coast Guard and the
state Department of Natural Resources went out in boats after
daybreak to try to find and identify the marine mammal, said
Kathleen Jamison, a public information officer with the natural
resources department.
   ``It's such a gray day here that it's not going to be easy to
spot it,'' Ms. Jamison said.
   The search crews hoped to guide the whale, of undetermined
species, back out to sea, she said.
   The last time a live whale was seen so far up the heavily
industrialized Delaware was in 1890, said Bob Schoelkopf, a
nationally recognized whale expert who directs the Marine Mammal
Stranding Center in Brigantine, N.J.
   ``It could be sick; it could be an old animal dying; it could
have been hit by a boat and dazed,'' Schoelkopf said.
   The Coast Guard was concerned both with the safety of the public
and the whale, which ``was just swimming around in circles,'' said
Chief Warrant Officer Dick Foy in Gloucester City, N.J.
   `A large freighter could kill the whale,'' he said. ``And if a
pleasure boat got too close, he could swish his tail and really
pose a hazard to small craft. We'll just try to entice it, coax it,
herd it, whatever you do with a whale, to try to get him back to
deep water where he belongs.''
   ``When we reached the Wilmington Terminal area, it came up right
in front of the boat,'' said Joyce Hennessey, a state Marine Police
officer. ``We have a 28-foot (boat), and it was bigger than that. I
would estimate it at 40 feet.''
   ``The Coast Guard is recommending that recreational and private
vessels exercise extreme caution in transitting the Delaware River
in the vicinity of the Delaware Memorial Bridge due to the size and
temperament of the whale,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Keith
Ferguson. ``The whale could inflict serious damage to a small
boater.''
   Boaters, however, ignored warnings and flocked to the river to
catch sight of the whale.
   ``I've never seen anything like this before in all my life,''
said Dave Boyd.
   ``We saw him first at 4:30. He broke water and jumped in the
air,'' said Gerry Cichocki. ``You'll know when he's coming up.
You'll hear him snort and spray, then come up.''

   Irish nationalist leader Dessie O'Hare
and four other men accused of kidnapping and maiming a wealthy
dentist entered guilty pleas today as their trial began.
   The five had been expected to plead innocent.
   O'Hare limped into court. Irish Republic police shot and
seriously wounded him and killed a companion at a roadblock three
weeks after police freed the dentist Nov. 5. The kidnappers had
escaped in a hijacked van after a shootout with police.
   The guilty pleas followed two adjournments that delayed the
proceedings at Dublin's anti-terrorist Special Criminal Court for
an hour.
   Scores of armed police and soldiers were posted around the
courthouse. An army helicopter hovered overhead when an armed
convoy escorting the defendants arrived from a top-security prison
in Portlaoise, 50 miles southwest of Dublin.
   The defendants each admitted to falsely imprisoning 38-year-old
John O'Grady. O'Hare also pleaded guilty to maliciously wounding
O'Grady with intent to maim. Other lesser charges were dropped.
   There was no immediate explanation of why the guilty pleas were
made. Prosecution and defense lawyers were expected to outline the
pleas in proceedings later today. Sentencing was expected Wednesday.
   The kidnappers chopped off tips of two of O'Grady's fingers
during his 22 days in captivity, authorities said. He was freed by
police after detectives chanced upon the gang in a Dublin house on
Nov. 5.
   Published reports said they had demanded a $2.5 million ransom,
but police said nothing had been paid.
   O'Hare, 29, is from Ballymacauley in Northern Ireland's County
Armagh. Two other Northern Ireland defendants are Anthony McNeill,
25, of Belfast; and Fergal Toal, 25, of the town of Armagh. The
other two defendants _ Edward Hogan, 25, of Dublin and Gerard
Wright, 45, of Cork _ come from the Irish Republic.
   O'Grady, who did not appear in the court, was abducted at
gunpoint from his Dublin home.
   However, his father-in-law, Dr. Austin Darragh, was the intended
target. Darragh established an international drugs testing company,
the Dublin-based Institute of Clinical Pharmacology.
   O'Hare was accused of masterminding the kidnapping. Nicknamed
the ``Border Fox'' for his activities along the border between the
Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, O'Hare is a former member of
the Irish Republican Army and its offshoot, the Irish National
Liberation Army. Both groups have disowned him as a liability in
their fight to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
   O'Hare has spent seven years in prison. He vowed police would
never take him alive in a clandestine interview with an Irish
newspaper during the kidnapping.

   Foreigners including businessmen,
sailors and U.S. troops must obtain certificates showing they are
free of the AIDS virus before they can stay in the Philippines, the
government said today.
   The order, which takes effect Monday, requires all merchant
sailors to present AIDS-free certificates regardless of how long
they plan to remain in the Philippines.
   Other foreigners must prove they are free of the virus if they
want to stay longer than six months, the Department of Foreign
Affairs said.
   It added that details of the regulation covering U.S. troops and
dependents would be worked out in talks with American authorities.
   Foreigners admitted for less than six months must obtain
AIDS-free certificates from government-approved hospitals if they
want to extend their stay, the department added.
   The regulation was issued in compliance with an order by the
Commission on Immigration and Deportation banning foreigners with
``loathsome or dangerous and contagious diseases.''
   Immigration officials said the order was issued to prevent the
spread of the deadly disease in a country where prostitution is
widespread.
   Some health officials have criticized the plan as ineffective.
They say foreigners admitted for short periods could spread AIDS
because they would not be required to prove they are free of the
disease.
   They also noted that foreigners could purchase forged
certificates. Immigration Commissioner Miriam Defensor-Santiago
said she did not include short-term residents or tourists in the
order because the move could lead to reprisals against Filipino
tourists by other nations.
   According to the Department of Health, more than 50 people in
the Philippines have been identified as carrying the AIDS virus but
most have not shown symptoms of the disease.
   Most of the infected people have been bar girls working near
U.S. military bases.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the
body's immune system and makes the victim susceptible to cancers
and other fatal ailments. There is no cure.
   The virus is primarily spread by sexual contact, use of
contaminated needles, and transfusions of contaminated blood. The
disease can be transferred from an infected mother to her unborn
child.

   The Academy Awards show seems to have stemmed
the extravaganza's television ratings decline by racking up its
highest rating in five years, according to preliminary data
released today by A.C. Nielsen Co.
   In the 15 largest television markets, Monday night's show had a
rating of 37.7 and a 59 share. The rating is a percentage of the
nation's 88.6 million homes with television. The share is a
percentage of sets in use.
   The last time the Oscars show rated higher was in 1983, when it
got a 38.0 and 59. Last year, the show had a national rating of
27.5 and a 43 share.
   When Nielsen computes the national rating for the show later
today, adding in smaller markets and rural areas, the numbers could
drop somewhat.
   The show lasted from 9 p.m. EDT until 12:30 a.m. But during
prime time, from 9-11 p.m., according to the big-city overnights,
it had a 38.3 rating and 56 share; NBC had a rating of 6.9 and a 10
share. CBS had a 6.4 and 9.

   Crude oil prices advanced again this morning
after a one-day jump incited by speculation that OPEC will
orchestrate a broad effort to constrict world supplies, though some
analysts called the rise unsustainable.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May-delivery contract
for West Texas Intermediate crude rose 4 cents per barrel to $17.93
early today after closing up $1.01 Monday at $17.89, the highest
close since mid-December.
   Refined products traded on the exchange were mixed after large
advances Monday. Wholesale heating oil fell 0.26 cent a gallon
after rising 2.42 cents during the previous session to 47.88 cents.
Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .10 cent a gallon to 51.05 cents
after a 2.18-cent rise the previous session.
   Elsewhere, several major U.S. oil companies, reacting to the
jump in crude prices, announced 50-cent increases in the price they
pay for West Texas Intermediate.
   Traders attributed the jumps to a weekend meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price-monitoring
committee, which stated it would enlist help from non-OPEC
producers to restrain output.
   A one-day surge in crude-oil prices does not necessarily mean
higher retail prices later. But if the market sustains the
increase, some analysts say, American consumers could be paying an
additional 10 to 12 cents a gallon for gasoline by the peak of the
summer season.
   ``This is not a flash in the pan. This is the beginning of a
bull move,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders
Futures Inc., a New York energy futures trading concern. ``The real
story is the oil market cycle has turned; it's ready to go higher.''
   Others discounted the move as a temporary spike in a market that
remains basically unchanged. They attributed it to misinformed
speculation about OPEC's strategy and influence.
   ``I see the OPEC thing as a fairly empty public relations
gesture,'' said Carol Epstein, analyst at Petroleum Analysis Ltd.,
a New York consulting and publishing concern. ``I don't see any
fundamental turning around here.''
   Ms. Epstein said her view was based partly on efforts by some
OPEC members, notably key producer Saudi Arabia, to move into the
refining or ``downstream'' end of the oil business. This suggests
OPEC itself believes the surplus of crude oil on world markets will
persist, which makes refining more attractive.
   Nevertheless, some analysts said the move by the OPEC price
monitoring committee was significant because the idea for
cooperation was initiated by eight non-OPEC exporters.
   Emissaries from Mexico, China, Oman, Angola, Colombia, Egypt,
Brunei and Malaysia, who met last month, concluded that
coordination with OPEC could help combat weak prices and excessive
supplies.
   ``There's momentum to have detente between OPEC and non-OPEC
producers,'' said Daniel Yergen, president of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, a petroleum market consulting company in
Cambridge, Mass. ``This would be a major shift in that direction.
It's bullish for higher prices.''
   OPEC's 13 members produce about 17.5 million barrels daily.
Production from the non-OPEC exporters interested in cooperating
with OPEC totals about 8 million barrels daily. An agreement
between them would affect production that accounts for more than
half the consumption in the non-communist world.
   But skepticism persists that OPEC could engineer an agreement to
restrain production among countries outside its jurisdiction. Some
analysts emphasize that OPEC has faced difficulty enforcing
internal discipline.
   ``Controlling production with 21 or so players isn't easy,''
said Stephen Smith, a petroleum analyst with Bear Stearns Cos. in
New York. ``Keeping 13 guys in line is tough enough.''
   Others said OPEC's previously failed efforts to maintain prices
had erased much of the once-mighty cartel's credibility, suggesting
its move to enlist support from non-OPEC exporters also was doomed.
   ``My attitude has been, talk is cheap with that crowd,'' said
John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``I think in the final analysis, they
have to produce some viable kind of agreement, and they haven't
been able to do it for the past year. Why should they do it now?''

   An accused murderer killed
himself while being held at a psychiatric institute by driving two
ballpoint pens through his heart, a corner's jury has ruled.
   The jury in suburban Vancouver issued its findings Monday after
pathologist Dr. Lindsay Sturrock testified on the suicide of Allen
Foster,37, at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute in Coquitlam,
another Vancouver suburb.
   Foster put the sharp end of a pen against his bare chest and,
with the other end propped against a door, leaned forward, forcing
the pen between his ribs and into his heart on Dec. 27, Sturrock
said.
   When that failed to kill him, Foster repeated the process with a
second pen, again penetrating his heart, and died of massive
bleeding into his chest cavity, the pathologist said.
   When a juror asked how anyone could twice complete such a
painful process, the pathologist said, ``If someone is sufficiently
disturbed to do away with himself, pain doesn't mean very much.''
   The jury recommended closer, 24-hour watches on maximum-security
patients and changes in the institute's assessment reporting system.
   Foster had been undergoing a 30-day psychiatric examination
after being charged with first-degree murder in the bludgeoning
death of his common-law wife, Joan Pilling, 34, her daughter Linda
Brewer and Brewer's friend Megan Sue McCleary, both 12.
   Foster surrendered to police Dec. 13, the day after the three
slayings, and was admitted to the institute Dec. 15.
   Terrance Neil, nursing director at the institute, testified that
Foster denied feelings of depression or suicide when he was
admitted.
   Shortly before his suicide, however, Foster wrote a letter to
correction officials begging for special protection in prison.

   Vice President George Bush said today
``I can't wait'' to take on any of the three Democrats still vying
for their party's nomination.
   Bush is seeking to build big-state support while acknowledging
his campaign lacks the excitement of the Democratic primary contest.
   ``I still intend to campaign right through the end of the
primary season. I can't wait to take on which ever one of those
three Democrats wins the Democratic nomination,'' Bush told a
$100-a-plate Republican breakfast in Schenectady.
   Bush planned to throw out the first ball at a Mets baseball game
in Shea Stadium in the afternoon.
   Bush is spending three days campaigning in New York state, even
though his only Republican opponent on the April 19 primary ballot
is former television evangelist Pat Robertson, who has ceased
active campaigning.
   ``We don't have all the excitement that exists on the Democratic
side of the aisle, but we have a lot more unity and we have fewer
problems,'' Bush told a shopping mall audience on Monday in White
Plains.
   During a visit to an IBM center in Thornwood, Bush declined to
comment on remarks by New York Mayor Ed Koch suggesting that New
York Jews ought not to vote for Democrat Jesse Jackson.
   ``Listen, I've got enough problems on our own side to get into
the Democratic nominating process,'' Bush said. ``Ed Koch is
entitled to his opinion. Each candidate is entitled to run on his
record.''
   In fact, Bush said, Jewish voters should vote for him. ``I think
everyone should vote for me. Besides, I'm a good friend of Israel.''
   Bush attended a fund-raiser Monday night in Greenwich, Conn., at
a private residence. Aides said $220,000 was collected at the
$1,000-a-plate event.
   Another fund-raising dinner was planned for tonight in Manhattan.
   Bush's campaign last week reached the maximum $27 million
pre-convention ceiling on contributions. Funds being raised now are
going toward a separate $2.8 million fund to comply with federal
election law audits.
   The vice president scheduled campaign stops in Buffalo and
Rochester on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Many Weekend Gang Arrest Cases Dismissed For Lack Of Evidence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have rejected about half the
cases brought so far following a giant weekend police sweep against
gangs, saying there is not enough evidence to proceed in court.
   Two nights of dusk-to-dawn patrols last weekend by about 1,000
officers resulted in 1,453 arrests, Officer Joe Mariani said.
   Charges have been filed so far in 32 of 60 cases taken to the
Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, said Deputy District
Attorney Stephen Kay. The other 28 were rejected because of lack of
evidence, he said.
   City attorney's spokesman Mike Qualls said half of the 41 cases
taken to his agency were rejected because of insufficient evidence.
Felony cases are normally prosecuted by the county, while the city
attorney takes misdemeanors.
   Other cases still must be reviewed.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates called for the show of force after a
rash of gang-related shootings, including a drive-by attack Good
Friday that killed one man and wounded a dozen other people.
   The weekend sweep dubbed ``Fly the Flag'' won praise from most
quarters, but three people whose house was allegedly ransacked by
police serving a search warrant called the show of force
heavy-handed.
   There were 387 gang-related murders in Los Angeles County last
year and more than 85 such homicides have been reported so far this
year.
   More than half of those arrested, or 794, were alleged gang
members, Mariani said. Offenses ranged from 171 arrested for
investigation of drug peddling to 138 allegedly driving under the
influence of alcohol of drugs, he said.
   ``We accomplished what we set out to do, namely letting gangs
know we mean to put them out of business,'' said police spokeswoman
Margie Reed. ``But we aren't saying when we'll hit again. We don't
particularly like to let them know we're coming like we did this
time.''
   Gates urged officers to get tough with gang members while
showing restraint in dealing with others living in gang-dominated
neighborhoods.
   But two men and a pregnant woman said officers serving a search
warrant Sunday ransacked their home, beat them and forced to lie on
the floor while handcuffed.
   ``I was just getting ready to watch the Laker game on TV when I
heard them kick in the front door and start breaking windows,''
said O.C. Baker, 34. ``They strapped a plastic loop on my wrists
real tight, made me get down on the foor and kicked me in the
ribs.''
   The plain-clothes officers put guns to the heads of the three
adults and repeatedly swore at them to obey orders, Baker said.
   Police Lt. Dave Hepburn, who led the raid, said a previous
undercover drug purchase at the house prompted the raid, but no
drugs were found.
   Despite the citywide gang crackdown, four people were killed in
drive-by shootings over the weekend, and nine other people were
injured in a similar attack in Willowbrook, authorities said.

   ``The Last Emperor,'' the lavish epic of
China directed by an Italian, conquered Hollywood by capturing nine
Oscars, the most for any film in 26 years. Cher won best actress
for portrayal of a widow who discovers love in ``Moonstruck.''
   Michael Douglas, the greedy, unethical inside trader of ``Wall
Street,'' was named best actor at Monday night's 60th-annual
Academy Awards ceremony.
   Best supporting performers were Olympia Dukakis, as Cher's
outspoken Italian mother coping with a wayward husband in
``Moonstruck,'' and Sean Connery, the hard-fisted, incorruptible
Chicago beat cop in ``The Untouchables.''
   Douglas paid tribute to his father, actor Kirk Douglas, ``for
helping a son move out of the shadow,'' and Cher credited her
mother for urging her as a little girl ``to be something.''
   ``I don't think this means that I am somebody,'' Cher told the
audience while clutching her statue. ``But I guess I'm on my way.
Thank you.''
   Backstage, the actress, in a stunning, form-revealing costume of
strategically placed spangles, told reporters: ``If I can win this
statue I think anybody can do anything!''
   In addition to best picture, ``The Last Emperor'' won in every
category in which it was nominated, including screenplay
adaptation, costumes, original score, art direction,
cinematography, sound, editing and the directing award to acclaimed
filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci.
   ``As an Italian, as a European, the Academy Awards has always
seemed to me like a distant ceremony,'' said Bertolucci,
``something fascinating, remote. Something I really didn't belong
to. Then, one day, `The Last Emperor' got nine nominations and
everything changed immediately.''
   The director, who surprised the industry by winning permission
from the Chinese government to film a story with political
overtones within Beijing's fabled Forbidden City, offered ``a
Chinese kowtow to the Academy,'' saying, ``This is one of the
strongest emotions of my life and I can't hide it.''
   The movie's nine Oscars marked the biggest haul since ``West
Side Story'' took 10 in 1962. The all-time champ, Ben Hur, won 11
in 1960.
   ``Moonstruck'' took three Oscars, but the critically acclaimed
``Hope and Glory'' and crowd-pleasers ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and
``Broadcast News'' struck out despite having five, one and seven
nominations, respectively.
   The Oscar audience of 6,300 cheered loudly for the supporting
actor and actress awards.
   ``OK, Michael, let's go!'' exclaimed Miss Dukakis as she held
her Oscar aloft. She was referring to her cousin Massachussets Gov.
Michael Dukakis, who is seeking the Democratic presidential
nomination. She said she would hit the campaign trial if her cousin
is nominated, and will seek to be a Democratic delegate from her
home state New Jersey.
   Backstage, she delivered an acceptance speech in Greek for
reporters from the land of her heritage.
   Connery, the original James Bond, drew two standing ovations
during the evening and addressed his thanks to, ``Ladies and
gentlemen, friends, and a few enemies.''
   Connery said he assumed his award was for ``an accumulation of
my different performances.''
   He also made a plea for an end to the 5{-week-old Writers Guild
of America strike that caused some clumsiness in the script for the
ceremony, which is normally written by some of Hollywood's best
wordsmiths.
   The award for song went to ``The Time of My Life'' from ``Dirty
Dancing,'' and the movie's stars, Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey,
appeared as presenters.
   In a ceremony that rewards dramatic expertise, there were many
lump-in-the throat moments, among them deaf actress Marlee Matlin's
presentation of the best actor Oscar to Douglas. Miss Matlin, who
won last year as best actress, abruptly abandoned her sign language
to speak haltingly as she announced the nominees and exclaimed an
exuberant, ``Good Morning, Vietnam!'' when she reached Robin
Williams' name.
   There was Billy Wilder's recollection of his origins as a German
immigrant and declaring of his special Irving Thalberg Award:
``This is the most prestigious award you can get outside the Nobel
Prize.''
   And there was screenwriter Patrick Shanley, holding his Oscar
for ``Moonstruck'' and enthusing, ``I don't care if we're supposed
to be cool. This is incredible! I want to thank everyone who ever
punched me or kissed me in my life.''
   He concluded, ``I'm sure I'd like to thank a lot of other
people. But I'm going home and die now.''
   The evening began with an award for visual effects to
``Innerspace,'' a fantasy about a test pilot reduced to microscopic
size. After that, perhaps the only surprise was the best foreign
language film award, which went to ``Babette's Feast'' from Denmark
over the highly favored ``Au Revoir, Les Enfants,'' Louis Malle's
memoir of his wartime childhood.
   The best animated short film award went to ``The Man Who Planted
Trees.'' Best documentary feature was ``The Ten-Year Lunch: The Wit
and Wisdom of the Algonquin Roundtable,'' and best documentary
short subject was ``Young At Heart.'' Best live action short film
was ``Ray's Male Heterosexual Dance Hall,'' and the award for
makeup went to ``Harry and the Hendersons.''
   The relocation of the Oscars to the cavernous Shrine Auditorium
caused logistical problems including a monumental traffic jam that
forced some stars to leave their limousines and walk rather than
miss the ceremonies. Best actress nominees Meryl Streep and Glenn
Close, who is nine months pregnant, were spotted hiking up the
street in their Oscar finery.

   Companies using ozone-destroying chemicals to
make plastic foam food packaging will switch to other compounds by
the end of the year, their trade association said today.
   While such use accounts for only 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the
U.S. production of the chemicals in question, chlorofluorocarbons
or CFCs, some environmentalists have targeted food packages as a
highly visible and unessential use of the CFCs.
   The environmentalists already had won pledges from fast food
chains not to use CFC-made products.
   About one-third of foam packages _ things like egg cartons and
clamshell hamburger containers _ are made with CFCs, said Joseph
Bow, president of the trade group, the Foodservice and Packaging
Institute, at a news conference.
   Most of the rest are manufactured with other compounds such as
pentane, but the CFCs in question are expected to be replaced by
the 15 companies using them with a related compound called HCFC-22.
   The program is voluntary on the part of the companies, but Bow
said none was expected to refuse to participate.
   The replacement compound has only about 5 percent of the
ozone-destroying potential of the CFCs it replaces. Jeffrey Eves, a
vice president of the Fort Howard Co., the largest user of CFCs in
making food packages, said the cost of using the replacement would
be about even with the old compounds.
   Three major environmental groups, Friends of the Earth, the
Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense
Council, praised the action and said they would join the institute
in monitoring HCFC-22 use and seeking an entirely benign
replacement.
   They also will use the action in pressuring companies with other
CFC uses to find alternatives, said David Doniger, an attorney for
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   ``It doesn't solve all the problems posed by plastic packaging.
Plastic packaging still poses a trash problem. Nevertheless, the
industry deserves support,'' said Doniger.
   Ozone at high altitudes protects the earth from the sun's
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, but can be destroyed by chlorine
liberated from the breakup of CFC compounds at those altitudes.
HCFC-22 breaks up much lower down in the atmosphere.
   Last month the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
reported that CFCs appear to have been responsible for an average
2.3 percent decline in the ozone shield at northern hemisphere
mid-latitudes from 1969 to 1986.
   A treaty signed by 31 nations last fall requires a 50 percent
cut in CFC production by 1998.

<TEXT>
   The Utah Department of Health has
protested a plan to build a laboratory at Dugway Proving Ground
that would be capable of testing bacteria and viruses for which
there are no known cures or vaccines.
   The department also said Monday that the Army's draft
environmental study on the biological test facility ``has serious
deficiencies.''
   Gov. Norm Bangerter and some members of Utah's congressional
delegation also oppose the Army's proposed $5.4 million biological
aerosol test facility.
   The lab would have the highest level of containment possible,
known as ``biosafety level 4.''
   The Army said it does not plan to conduct tests requiring BL4
containment, but it has not ruled out such tests in the future.
   Dr. Suzanne Dandoy, executive director of the Health Department,
said the draft environmental study ``is totally inadequate in
justifying the need or addressing the impacts of a biological
level-four facility.
   ``We are opposed to the construction of a BL4 facility because
there is no justification of need nor information that demonstrates
that the public could be protected,'' Dandoy said in a letter
Monday to Dugway's commander, Col. James Tipton.
   Dandoy recommended that a citizen advisory board of state and
national experts be created to evaluate the need for and potential
risks associated with a BL4 facility.
   Dandoy also recommended the state be granted full oversight of
research at Dugway.
   ``Specifically, the Utah Department of Health should be apprised
of all microorganisms being tested, and should be notified
immediately of any accidental pathogen or toxin exposures or
releases,'' the department said.
   The department contends it is possible a worker ``could be
unknowingly contaminated with a pathogen, spreading this in the
community before the contagion is recognized.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Missing newlyweds toyed with the idea of secretly
selling her expensive foreign car and running away to another
country, possibly Brazil, according to an entry in the woman's
journal.
   But friends and family of Wheaton College students Scott
Swanson, 23, and Carolyn MacLean, 21, were not taking the entry
seriously on Monday.
   The couple, secretly married March 26, were last seen April 2
when they left Ms. MacLean's grandmother's house in Flint, Mich.,
on their way back to Illinois.
   The two were supposed to have dinner in Chicago before visiting
Swanson's parents in Elgin, but they never showed up. Ms. MacLean's
red BMW was found April 2 in an alley behind Chicago's Orchestra
Hall. The key was in the ignition and the engine was running,
police said.
   The journal entry mentioning selling the car and going away was
undated. It did not mention Swanson by name but used the pronoun
``we,'' police said. They declined to disclose the exact wording of
the entry.
   But police said that if the pair did indeed flee in search of a
new life, they left behind Swanson's passport, both their driver's
licenses and credit cards.
   ``We're looking for a break,'' said Cmdr. Ettore DiVito of the
Chicago Police Youth Division. ``We're being very open-minded.''
   Gwendy Kem, Ms. MacLean's best friend, said the title to the car
is in her father's name, making a secret sale difficult.
   ``The fact remains that they were not organized for (running
away),'' she said.
   Over the weekend and again Monday, searchers used a special
airplane equipped with infrared sensors to detect freshly buried
corpses, but they failed to turn up a trace of the newlyweds.
   ``While we hope the couple hasn't met with foul play, this is
something we have to do,'' state police spokesman Bob Fletcher said.
   DiVito said law enforcement personnel from Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan and Wisconsin are cooperating in the search.

   Iran offered to storm the hijacked Kuwaiti
jetliner after it was forced to land in northeastern Iran but
Kuwait rejected the offer, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Javad
Larijani said today.
   Larijani, speaking at a news conference at the Iranian Embassy,
said Iran had no alternative but to refuel the aircraft and allow
it to leave Mashhad on Friday. It later landed at Larnaca, Cyprus.
   He said the Kuwaiti authorities rejected the Iranian offer to
storm the Boeing 747 ``saying they are not going to take
responsibility for the outcome of that operation.''
   Asked what advice Kuwait gave, he said, ``I should say, nothing.
And we were afraid that the airplane would be blown up so we were
forced to refuel it. It was against our wish. But this was the only
thing we could do.''
   He said the hijacked aircraft would not be allowed back to Iran.
   ``We think it's for the people in Cyprus to decide,'' Larijani
said. ``Iran will be closed to all hijacked airplanes forever.''
   He denied news reports that additional hijackers were allowed to
board the plane in Iran.
   ``Hijacking innocent people is wrong,'' he said. ``These people
should be released immediately. This is not a noble deed for a
noble cause at all.''
   The hijackers, who commandeered the Kuwait Airways plane April 5
on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait, have demanded that Kuwait free
17 convicted terrorists.
   The plane carried 112 people when it left Bangkok. Fifty-seven
people were freed in Iran, and one man was released after the plane
reached Cyprus. The hijackers have killed two passengers.

   Fourteen-month-old Siamese twin girls who
were joined from the waist down have been separated in a 12-hour
operation, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia announced today.
   Both girls were in critical but stable condition, which was
considered normal after such an operation, said hospital
spokeswoman Laura Feragen. The operation was performed Monday.
   The family requested that the girls' names and home town not be
released, the spokeswoman said.
   The twins were joined front to front, said Bonnie Jacobs,
another hospital spokeswoman. Each girl had one leg and they shared
a third, fused leg, she said.
   The type of joining affects only about 1 percent of all Siamese
twins, Ms. Feragen said. However, it was the fourth such incidence
treated at Children's Hospital, she said.
   Since December the twins had been undergoing a series of
skin-expanding procedures using balloon-like silicon implants into
which saline solution was pumped, Ms. Feragen said. The procedure
eliminated the need for skin grafts.
   Dr. James A. O'Neill Jr., the hospital's surgeon-in-chief,
headed a 13-member operating team.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer whose
Pulitzer Prize was challenged by a magazine that ran a similar
story says he had no doubt his award would be upheld.
   The Pulitzer board's executive committee said Monday it saw no
reason to question the award to Tim Weiner, who won the national
reporting prize for a 1987 series on the Defense Department's
``black budget'' for secret projects.
   The National Journal last week asked the board to reconsider the
Inquirer's prize.
   The Washington-based weekly magazine said Weiner's series was
``a blatant and egregious case of building a news story according
to someone else's blueprint,'' namely, the magazine's March 1,
1986, cover story about the black budget. It contended that
Weiner's story broke no new ground.
   In Philadelphia on Monday, Weiner called the National Journal's
challenge ``a false charge and a phony controversy.''
   ``I never had any doubts it would be resolved this way,'' he
said. ``It's been very instructive being on the other end of the
telescope.''
   The committee's decision shows its members are ``able to cut
through baloney when they see it,'' said James M. Naughton, the
Inquirer's deputy managing editor.
   ``We appreciate the promptness with which the Pulitzer board
acted on our request for a review,'' National Journal publisher
John Fox Sullivan said in a statement. ``We raised the issue of
recycled journalism in good faith and now consider the current
matter closed.''
   The Pulitzer Board said in a statement that after careful
consideration of the Journal's objections, the executive committee
found no reason to question the award.
   Three committee members met in New York on Monday and two joined
in on the phone from Washington, said board secretary Robert
Christopher.
   ``It was relatively brief and there wasn't any disagreement,''
Christopher said. ``Everybody was in accord on what should be done
or should not be done.''
   The statement said the decision was reached by unanimous vote of
the five executive committee members participating, he said. Two
members, Inquirer executive editor Eugene Roberts and David
Laventhol, president of the Times Mirror Co., which owns the
National Journal, did not take part.
   Those taking part included Christopher; Roger W. Wilkins, senior
fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies; James
F. Hoge Jr., publisher of the New York Daily News; Charlotte
Saikowski, Washington bureau chief of The Christian Science
Monitor; and Columbia University President Michael I. Sovern.
   Christopher said last week that prize-winning stories don't have
to break new ground, but only represent ``a distinguished example
of reporting on national affairs.''
   ``Our object was to publish the most complete, thorough,
readable account of the black budget ever done, and we are
convinced we did it,'' said Roberts.
   The Inquirer said Weiner broke new ground with his analysis of
the Defense Department budget, concluding that the department had
$35 billion in hidden programs.
   Weiner said he interviewed more than 100 people across the
nation and was ``knee-deep'' in his work before he saw the
Journal's story.

   Democrats Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore Jr. tangled in a
sometimes contentious debate in New York today, while rival Jesse
Jackson declared he was no longer the underdog but ``one of the top
dogs, and I just love it.''
   Gore and Dukakis engaged in exchanges over the Middle East,
welfare and their own presidential race _ and the Massachusetts
governor upbraided the Tennessee senator for attacking him as too
soft on Jackson.
   Dukakis, the front-runner, said he would compete for delegates
won by other candidates who have left the race and even ``maybe for
Al Gore's delegates.''
   ``Don't lick your chops too soon, Governor Dukakis,'' Gore shot
back. ``New York's going to have a bigger say about that than you
will.''
   The debate came one week before the New York primary, with 255
delegates at stake, and was the first full-scale Democratic debate
since last month's Super Tuesday campaign.
   Elsewhere in the Empire State, Vice President George Bush told a
$100-a-plate Republican breakfast in Schenectady today that despite
his virtual lock on the GOP nomination, ``I still intend to
campaign right through the end of the primary season.''
   ``I can't wait to take on whichever one of those three Democrats
wins the Democratic nomination,'' he said.
   Gore, in the 90-minute Democratic debate, claimed for himself
the role of underdog, a position supported by his standing in the
polls. But Jackson, whose candidacy has moved from a symbolic one
four years ago to a contending one this year, said New York doesn't
necessarily favor the underdog.
   ``I was an underdog for 45 years and 11 months, and now I'm one
of the top dogs, and I just love it,'' Jackson said. ``New York
loves a winner, and I'm a winner.''
   The Democrats' debate reflected the New York primary's focus on
Middle East issues.
   Gore cited disagreements with both Jackson and Dukakis on the
issue of an independent state for Palestinians, saying Dukakis had
sounded a note of ``enthusiasm'' about such a prospect. He said he
disagreed ``with the way Jesse Jackson advocates a Palestinian
state.''
   Gore, trailing far behind his two rivals in polls in New York,
also said that Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, recently
recommended ``very, very deep cuts'' in aid to welfare recipients
and poor families as part of his new budget for Massachusetts.''
   ``That's absolutely incorrect,'' Dukakis shot back. ``You're
wrong. You're wrong.''
   The candidates met in an 90-minute debate in New York's Felt
Forum, the event sponsored by the New York Daily News.
   Jackson, who has drawn opposition from some Jewish leaders, said
mutual recognition and security were goals in the occupied
territories in the Middle East. ``While we can guarantee secure
borders, we cannot ensure tranquility so long as there is
occupation,'' he said.
   Gore, calling the issue ``politically charged,'' then said he
had disagreements with Jackson and Dukakis.
   Dukakis said, ``I think we can disagree without suggesting
anyone is attacking anyone. And Al, I think I heard you correctly
when you were attacking me for not attacking Jesse. That's the
first time that's happened in 25 years.''
   Gore responded, ``What I said was you were timid in not being
willing to say why you believed you would make a better president
than Jesse Jackson.''
   Dukakis shot back, ``No, you said I was timid because I would
not attack this man. First time that's happend.''
   ``I didn't express enthusiasm for a Palestinian state
yesterday,'' Dukakis added. ``I expressed enthusiasm for
presidential leadership to persuade Arab leaders to finally stand
up and say they were prepared to commit themsevlves'' to saying
Israel has a right to exist.
   Monday night, a little Hollywood glitter rubbed off Dukakis'
campaign, as his cousin picked up an Academy Award.
   ``OK, Michael, let's go!'' Olympia Dukakis called as she
accepted her Oscar for best supporting actress for her performance
in the comedy ``Moonstruck.'' Dukakis, at a restaurant in New York
that figured in the film, called his cousin to congratulate her,
and said her triumph ``may be a sign of good things to come in New
York.''
   Bush, touring an IBM plant in Thornwood, N.Y., on Monday, called
himself ``a good friend of Israel'' and said American Jews should
vote for him and not a Democrat.
   Dukakis, speaking to Jewish leaders, said Arab leaders are
responsible for the violence in the Israeli-occupied territories.
He said neither the young stone-throwers nor the Israeli government
bear the blame.
   Jackson, in a delicate position because he made comments in 1984
that offended many Jews, continued to put distance between himself
and Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, with
whom he once met.
   Jackson called the PLO leader one of the ``most extreme
elements'' in the conflict, and urged Jewish and Arab-Americans to
hold talks themselves in an effort to find common ground.
   His comment about Arafat drew the ire of some Arab-Americans.
Abdeen Jabara, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee, sent a letter to Jackson, complaining, ``Your comments
in New York have the appearance of tailoring your positions on
critical issues to suit the narrow political views of powerful
special interests.''
   Gore, on Monday, continued to stress his support for Israel,
adding it would be possible to test some sort of limited autonomy
for Palestinians on the West Bank. But he said any such formula
would have to include assurances of security for Israel.
   Gore has been lagging behind Dukakis and Jackson in polls of New
York voters as well as the national delegate count. The latest AP
count puts Dukakis at 745.05, Jackson at 709.55, Gore at 395.8 and
uncommitted 514.35. To nominate, 2,082 delegates are needed.

<HEAD>100 Still Missing After Pakistani Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 people were still missing
today, two days after an explosion at an ammunition depot killed 93
people and injured 1,100.
   State-run Pakistan television said 170 teams of explosives
experts, working around the clock, have so far cleared 20,000
missiles, grenades and other weapons that lay around the twin
cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq said Monday that an estimated
6,500 devices were to be cleared. There was no explanation for the
discrepancy in the figures.
   The Los Angeles Times reported today that agents from the
pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan were apparently responsible
for Sunday's explosion.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said Pakistani
military experts had told U.S. officials about the cause of the
blast.
   The explosion was caused by three incendiary devices carried to
the ammunition dump by trucks bearing Afghan license plates and
equipped with time fuses, the Times said. They were exploded in
sequence, the newspaper said.
   Unidentified U.S. sources told the newspaper the explosions
wiped out a major source of CIA-supplied tactical assault weapons
for resistance fighters battling the Soviet-backed government in
Afghanistan.
   A four-man U.S. team of bomb disposal experts is helping to
clear the unexploded ammunition, including some which fell on the
residences of U.S. Embassy personnel and the international school.
   Television reports said most of the children missing from
Sunday's blasts at the Ojeri army camp have been reunited with
their families. About 100 people remained unaccounted for, it said.
   The Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo and
the Senate met today to review the situation.
   Pakistani television said that during the Cabinet meeting, it
was decided that a committee investigating the explosion should
submit its findings with recommendations within 10 days and that
they will be made public.

   President Reagan's wealthy friends who are
buying a California estate for him to occupy probably could give it
to him without violating conflict-of-interest laws, according to
the Office of Government Ethics.
   The opinion confirms that industrialists Holmes Tuttle and Earle
Jorgensen are among the 20 or so businessmen who purchased a $2.5
million home for the Reagans to live in when they leave the White
House next year.
   The July 31, 1986, letter was written in response to a request
from private attorneys who wanted to determine whether the
arrangement would be ethically appropriate. It was made available
to The Associated Press today by a Washington law firm.
   The Reagans began paying rent under a three-year lease which
took effect March 1 with an option to buy the house eventually. The
White House says Reagan and his wife Nancy will pay fair-market
rent for the property.
   The opinion letter notes that criminal conflict-of-interest laws
don't apply to the president.
   It says standards of conduct for the executive office of the
president restrict an employee's acceptance of any gift from a
person who is doing business with the employee's agency.
   However, the letter notes that an employee may accept a gift
from a friend, when the circumstances make it clear that the
personal relationship is the motivating factor.
   ``If your proposal was viewed as a favor or as something of
monetary value, there would be an exception that would permit the
president to accept it,'' said the letter by David Martin, the
ethics office's former director.
   The letter was requested by Washington lawyers representing Wall
Management Services Inc., the company in which the Reagans' friends
bought stock in order to raise the capital to buy the home for the
Reagans in 1986.
   In a July 21, 1986, request to the ethics office marked
``confidential,'' the lawyers for Wall Management Services said
that a group of about 18 financially independent friends of the
Reagans proposed to buy and renovate the Bel Air home. In an
interview Monday night, Wall Management's chief financial officer,
Ira Revich, said ``approximately 20'' friends of the Reagans had
bought stock in the company.
   The 1986 request didn't identify the businessmen and Revich
refused to name them. Under California law, companies incorporated
in that state don't have to identify stockholders.
   Tuttle and Jorgensen are listed as directors and the 1986
request to the ethics office describes their business activities
and says they are stockholders.
   The ``confidential'' request says that at least one of the
investors had loaned money to the president's inaugural committee
and that about six had given the president or the first lady gifts
in the previous six years. A number of the investors had served as
informal, non-government advisers to the president. But he has
appointed some of them, or their spouses or relatives, to various
commissions or federal posts, said the request.
   In an interview, Martin said he recalled that the ethics office
had gotten the names of the investors after requesting them and
that the office ``went through the whole conflicts of interest''
analysis.
   The house is in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, about 12
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles and near the University of
California. It has three bedrooms and six bathrooms, a formal
living room, a family room, a sun room, a butler's pantry and three
servant's rooms.
   Among the neighbors are Elizabeth Taylor, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mac
Davis and Burt Bacharach.

   Grateful black residents who
won a court battle against the government offered their white
lawyer a bride, but he politely declined.
   ``I am very pleased to say that I already have a wife,'' said
John Dugard, head of the Institute of Applied Legal Studies at the
University of the Witswatersrand in Johannesburg.
   The community northwest of Pretoria made the offer in keeping
with tribal tradition.
   Dugard represented the 120,000-member community, Moutse, that
was incorporated by the government into a homeland dominated by a
different tribe on Jan. 1, 1986.
   The government's 10 homelands are part of a plan to grant
limited autonomy to the country's blacks. They are not
internationally recognized, however.
   A court ruled March 29 that President P.W. Botha exceeded his
powers when he incorporated Moutse into the KwaNdebele homeland.
The community is independent of any homeland as a result of the
decision.
   Most Moutse residents belong to the North Sotho tribe. They
argued that their language and culture differed sharply from the
Ndebeles, who make up most of KwaNdebele's 400,000 people.

   Farmers and ranchers cannot use strychnine
above ground to control rodents and other pests if the poison would
threaten protected wildlife, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy said Monday the Environmental
Protection Agency violated federal law in registering strychnine
for above-ground pest control.
   The ruling affects 62 species and subspecies of animals that are
protected under federal law, including grizzly bears, salt marsh
harvest mice, Canada geese, wolves, owls, hawks, California condors
and bald and golden eagles.
   ``It is the most broad-ranging opinion ever issued under the
Endangered Species Act, both in the number of different animals it
protects and the fact that it protects them almost across the
entire United States,'' said Brian O'Neill, a lawyer for three
environmental groups that filed suit.
   Murphy said federal regulations require strychnine-laced baits
be set so that only targeted animals are likly to eat the poison.
   However, she noted, ``Strychnine is non-selective. It kills
anything which ingests a lethal dose. Mortality can occur to both
`target' and `non-target' species.''
   Up to 500,000 pounds of strychnine-laced bait is used annually
to kill pests such as prairie dogs, ground squirrels, meadow mice
and nuisance birds that eat farm crops, according to court
documents. The poison is used mainly in the West, but also in some
Eastern states.
   Murphy said her injunction will remain in effect indefinitely
unless the EPA can demonstrate how it might allow use of the poison
and still prevent the incidental deaths of protected wildlife.
   Murphy said the EPA violated the Endangered Species Act, the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection
Act in registering strychnine.
   The decision did not specify geographical limits for the ban,
but said the poison cannot be used anywhere it would threaten an
protected wildlife. Some protected species, such as Canada geese,
cover wide areas in their annual migrations.
   Charles Shochey, a Justice Department lawyer who represented the
EPA in the case, said Monday that he had not seen Murphy's decision
and could not comment.
   The lawsuit was filed against the EPA in August 1986 by the
Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, and Friends of Animals and
Their Environment.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents more than
3 million farmers and ranchers, joined the case in support of the
EPA.
   The environmentalists said that at least 24 states reported
posioning of protected wildlife that had either eaten
strychnine-laced bait or the remains of other animals exposed to
the bait.
   Documents given Murphy showed five condors, six peregrine
falcons, 15 golden eagles, 31 bald eagles and 724 other birds and
mammals had died after eating the bait.
   In Minnesota, there were documented reports of deaths from
strychnine poisoning from 1978 to 1983 involving mallard ducks,
snowy owls, a redtailed hawk, a gyrfalcon and a bald eagle, the
environmental groups said.

   Hundreds of railway employees attacked train
conducters with picks and stones after three co-workers were
prevented from riding free, and 33 people were injured, it was
reported Tuesday.
   The official China Youth News said five people remained in
serious condition, and train windows were broken in the April 4
melee in southeastern Guangdong province.
   The attackers stripped the clothes of women conductors and
kicked one pregnant conductor in the stomach, the newspaper
reported. The workers used sticks to beat other employees and
passengers who tried to protect them.
   The attack came after conductors refused to give free passage to
three men who said they were railway employees but lacked
identification. Railway employees are allowed free travel.
   The paper said the train was heading for Canton, the capital of
Guangdong, at the time. When it returned through the same area
later in the day, 300 to 400 angry rail employees were waiting, the
report said.
   The main attack took place at Shaoguan. When the train arrived
at Zheling, a smaller station down the line, more attackers came
aboard and continued the assault, the newspaper said.
   There was no mention of arrests.

   Wherever Greek-Americans have settled across the land, they have
settled on Michael Dukakis, son of Greek immigrants, as their
presidential candidate.
   ``I think it's wonderful a Greek has come up this far,'' said
Alexandra Matheos, a 62-year-old retired luncheonette owner, as she
stood inside St. Basil's after an Easter service. ``It means a lot
to all ethnics. When we were kids we never thought we'd live to see
a Greek nominated.''
   Dukakis' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination
has caused a surge of excitement among those who came to America
from Greece, like Dukakis' parents, and among their
first-generation children.
   About 25 percent of the $15 million Dukakis has raised in
campaign contributions came from the Greek-American community,
believed to number about 1 million.
   ``A lot about the Dukakis candidacy stimulates
Greek-Americans,'' says Elias Vlanton, information director of the
American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association. ``He invokes
his Greek heritage and the values that Greeks hold dear _ love of
family, the need and importance of public service.''
   Among the people of Greek origin in Troy, a melting pot city of
56,000 overlooking the Hudson River, famous for its hot dogs and as
the place where collars for Arrow shirts were once made, Dukakis
looms as large as the local legend, Samuel Wilson.
   Wilson, buried in Troy Cemetery, was a meatpacker and patriot
who supplied American troops during the War of 1812 with barrels of
beef stamped with the letters ``U.S.'' to identify them as property
of the government. He became known as ``Uncle Sam,'' namesake of
the patriotic symbol.
   Leaving St. Basil's the other day, Roula Aletrakis, 53-year-old
native of Greece, was taken aback at the suggestion that she might
vote for anyone other than Dukakis.
   ``Sure, yes, we're Greek people,'' she said when a visitor asked
if she was voting for Dukakis.
   ``I've always voted Republican, but this time I'm voting
Democrat,'' said her husband, Tony, 66, a retired woodworker.
   In New York's primary on Tuesday, Greek-American voters are
rallying to Dukakis just as they have in earlier primary states.
   Even Greek-Americans who are Republican assume that Dukakis will
be the Democratic candidate and are ready to bolt the GOP for their
kinsman in November.
   ``I'm Republican,'' said Nick Zembekis, 50, a Greek native who
works at Chris-Craft Industrial Products, Inc. ``Sure I'm voting
for Dukakis because I'm Greek, that's why. That's all. If I'm not
Greek I don't vote for Dukakis.''
   Sitting on a stool next to Zembekis in the Famous Lunch, his
friend, John Oureilidis, a 40-year-old bowling equipment supplier,
backed him up.
   ``Dukakis all the way,'' said Oureilidis. ``I believe the things
he says, plus he's Greek. He talks sense. Nobody talks about poor
people like he does. I believe he can do it. He's our boy so we
have to vote for him.''
   Occasionally, there is a dissenter like Nikolaos Adamou, 37, a
native of Greece and an economics teacher at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, who is a supporter of Jesse Jackson.
   ``Jackson is going to protect American interests more
effectively in Third World countries,'' he said. ``I like Dukakis.
He's Greek. Nothing personally.''
   Just the same, there is an outpouring of pride in Dukakis,
especialy among older Greek-Americans.
   ``I think they've been very supportive and very important to the
campaign,'' says Paul Brountas, Dukakis' national campaign chairman
and a Greek-American himself whose ties to the Massachusetts
governor go back to their college days.
   ``The thing you have to remember is that in the early stages of
his campaign there were two principal sources of contributions. One
was a very strong base of support in Massachusetts. The second
point was the Greek support.''
   The Rev. Emmanuel Mantzouris, pastor of St. Basil's, which has
about 250 Greek-Americans in its congregation, said, ``I think a
lot of Greeks are very politically oriented. Just knowing he's
Greek draws their attention, somebody being Greek in the
limelight.''

<HEAD>National Merit Test Program Unfair to Girls, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Girls are not getting their fair share of
National Merit Scholarships and would win more of the awards if
high school grades as well as test scores were counted, a group
critical of standardized tests said Tuesday.
   Boys generally outscore girls on the qualifying test to become
National Merit semifinalists, just as they do on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test and other standardized exams.
   But FairTest, a group also known as the National Center for Fair
& Open Testing, said girls perform better in class than boys. It
said high school grades should count just as much as the test
scores when the 15,000 National Merit semifinalists are chosen each
year.
   The sponsor, the National Merit Scholarship Corp., said that
would drive up the cost of administering the prestigious award
program and reduce the amount available for scholarships.
   Sarah Stockwell of FairTest called the National Merit
Scholarship Corp.'s reliance on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude
Test to select semifinalists ``extraordinarily irresponsible'' and
said it costs women ``millions of dollars each year.''
   Marianne Roderick, a senior vice president of the National Merit
Scholarship Corp. in Evanston, Ill., said 63 percent of this year's
National Merit semifinalists are boys.
   ``It has been true over a number of years that boys outnumber
girls by about 60-40, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little
less,'' she said.
   She defended the use of the standardized test to select
semifinalists. ``The merit program is open to more than a million
youngsters who enter it each year and we have no quotas regarding
boys or girls or ethnic origin or anything else.''
   Using the test ``is the best method we have found to date to
make entry to the program available ... at a relatively nominal
fee,'' she said, adding that switching to some other method of
selection would drive up administrative costs.
   Once the 15,000 semifinalists are chosen, the National Merit
Scholarship Corp. does look at their high school grades,
extracurricular activities and achievements in whittling the field
down to 6,000 winners who receive scholarships ranging from $250 to
$8,000.
   Last year, among the 6,146 who got scholarships, 62 percent were
boys and 38 percent were girls, Roderick said.
   The activist group said it also suspects that minorities are
underrepresented among the ranks of the National Merit winners,
despite special awards earmarked for black students.
   The organization sponsors a separate National Achievement
Scholarship Program for Outstanding Negro Students that awards
about 700 scholarships annually, but Roderick said it does not
collect ethnic data from other contestants.
   Many colleges vie in recruiting National Merit winners and some
fund their own scholarships through the National Merit program.
Corporations and the National Merit Scholarship Corp. itself
provide the other scholarships.
   The Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test, also called the
National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test, is essentially the same
as the Scholastic Aptitude Test, although it is scored on a
different scale. In selecting semifinalists, the verbal score
counts twice as much as the math score.
   The overall qualifying score varies from state to state;
one-half of one percent of each state's graduating seniors are
chosen.
   Last year, when the national average for the Class of 1987 was
906, boys averaged 935 and girls 878.
   The Cambridge, Mass.-based FairTest said the tests' multiple
choice format seems to favor boys because research suggests they
are more adept at guessing, and male characters are featured more
often in test questions than females, making the questions more
``male-oriented.''
   FairTest also said SAT scores underpredict women's actual grades
in college.
   Fred Moreno, a spokesman for the College Board in New York,
which sponsors the PSAT and SAT, said that charge is based on a
College Board research report which found women did ``a little bit
better in college'' than predicted by their combined SATs and
grades.
   ``But the difference is very, very small,'' said Moreno. The
actual grades of the women studied were four-hundredths of one
point higher than predicted, he said. ``There's no proof that the
test is biased.''

<HEAD>Fragment of Gold Bracelet Linked to Ramses' Favorite Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workmen cleaning the dusty tomb of Ramses
II's beautiful Queen Nefertari found a fragment of beaten gold
jewelry that grave robbers and tourists apparently overlooked for
3,250 years.
   Resins clinging to the etched fragment indicate it may have been
attached originally to her missing mummy, Egyptian and American
officials said Tuesday in announcing the find.
   If the fragment is determined to have belonged to the queen, it
would be rare indeed. The only other surviving legacy of Nefertari
is the lid of her sarcophagus, on exhibit at the Turin Egyptian
Museum in Italy.
   Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosni called the jewelry, which
is 1{ inches long and an inch wide, ``a significant discovery _
only the second object ever found that probably belonged to
Nefertari.''
   The piece resembles segments of armlets or bracelets surviving
from Ramses' New Kingdom era, with golden pieces linked by chains
and beads and decorated with flowers.
   The fragile gold sheet was in an anteroom behind the queen's
burial chamber, found during a project to stop the decay of
Nefertari's tomb in southern Egypt's Valley of the Queens.
Sponsored by the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and the Getty
Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey, Calif., the project began
18 months ago and is expected to last another 3{ years.
   With its splendid vividly colored wall paintings, Nefertari's is
the greatest among 80 tombs in shallow valleys called ``the place
of beauty.'' Royal wives and children were buried there in rock-cut
tombs opposite the ancient capital Thebes, now called Luxor, 450
miles south of Cairo.
   Luis Monreal, the Getty Institute's director, said nobody
believed anything of significance had escaped the attention of
grave robbers or the thousands of tourists and conservators who
visited the tomb since its discovery in 1904.
   Workmen inching across the floor of the tomb's final chamber,
clearing away the centuries of dust by hand, found the fragment on
Feb. 8, Monreal said.
   It lay ``covered by dust, then by broken bits of wall paintings
which in themselves were covered by layers of dust,'' he said.
   ``Another real bonus that we hadn't expected is that we
recovered pieces of a complete segment (of wall painting), which
will cover some 10 square feet when we reattach it to the rear
wall,'' he said.
   Although proof hasn't been found that the fragment was
Nefertari's, there are indications, including its hieroglyphic
inscriptions, Monreal said.
   Los Angeles-based British Egyptologist Helen Strudwick, who
studied the piece for Getty, found significance in the ritual
inscription ``true of voice,'' a phrase ancient Egyptians normally
used after the name of the person who died.
   She noted that the phrase had a feminine ending. That, plus the
fragment's discovery inside Nefertari's tomb, ``highly suggests''
that it was from the queen's burial paraphernalia, perhaps even
torn from her mummified body.
   ``The piece does not rank with the Tutankhamun treasure in
esthetic terms, but it still has historical and sentimental value
because the powerful Nefertari simply vanished,'' Monreal said.
   Nefertari, the beautiful and bold wife of warrior-hero Ramses
II, is thought to have died about age 45 about 3,250 years ago. Her
tomb paintings and inscriptions depict her as a woman of great
charm and exquisite taste, adorned with magnificent jewelry and
wearing fashionable gowns.
   Ramses' favorite of 13 wives, Nefertari accompanied her husband
in battle and helped negotiate the world's first peace treaty,
Ramses' agreement with the troublesome Hittites of Asia Minor. In
her famous temple at Abu Simbel, Nefertari is pictured begging
Ramses to be gentle with his captives.
   ``Nefertari was the world's first first lady,'' Monreal said.
``She was last seen accompanying her husband to consecrate the two
temples at Abu Simbel in 1255 B.C. Then we know nothing of her.
Maybe this piece will tell us about her death.''

   A Marine on security patrol in Panama
has been killed, apparently by gunfire from a fellow Marine, a
spokesman at the U.S. Southern Command said today.
   The Marine, a corporal, was a member of I Company, 3rd
Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, which is based here and was sent to
riot-torn Panama last week, said U.S. Air Force Col. Ron Sconyers.
   The name of the slain Marine has not been released pending
notification of his family. He was shot at least once in the
stomach and was pronounced dead at 1:10 a.m. today at Gorgas
Hospital in Panama.
   Attempts to revive the Marine with open-heart massage were
unsuccessful. Several major arteries were hit by the bullet and the
Marine suffered massive internal bleeding, Sconyers said.
   The slain man was part of a 12-Marine security patrol at an
underground tank facility near Rodman Naval Station on the western
side of the Panama Canal.
   The Marine patrol was split into sections of nine and three
Marines when a trip flare was set off, apparently by an intruder,
the spokesman said.
   ``Instead of the flare going up, there was a loud crack, like
gunfire. Someone starting shooting,'' Sconyers said.
   No intruders were apprehended. ``In the confusion of the firing,
the intruders all escaped,'' he said.
   ``Friendly fire from Marines was the only fire we had in the
area,'' he said.
   Circumstances of the shooting are under investigation, said Maj.
Stuart Wagner, director of Camp Lejeune's Joint Public Affairs
Office.

   A former Massachusetts Institute of Technology
scientist testified today that he knew of fraud taking place in
research at the institute but was reluctant to report it because he
feared retribution.
   Dr. Charles Maplethorpe, who was conducting post-doctoral
research at MIT, said he learned of what he considered fraudulent
research by Thereza Imanishi-Kari but was reluctant to report it
until just before receiving his degree.
   Dr. Maplethorpe said he told an MIT official that he suspected
fraud and the official's only action was to give him a form to fill
out.
   ``I felt there was no question that if I made a formal charge of
fraud it would not be taken seriously and I would be the person
worst off for it,'' he said.
   Appearing today under subpoena before the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, Maplethorpe
said he was very reluctant to present the testimony and would not
be there except for the legal compulsion.
   ``There is a tremendous disincentive to come forward and once
they come forward, the instigators will pay a price,'' he said.
   The testimony came during hearings on practices of fraud in the
government's $5-billion biomedical research program.
   In testimony before another subcommittee yesterday, Walter W.
Stewart and Dr. Ned Feder, two National Institutes of Health
scientists, said they have received unfavorable job ratings since
they have acted as whistleblowers about false research data
reported by NIH grant recipients.
   Stewart and Feder said they began investigating allegations of
misconduct by grant recipients about four years ago.
   Although NIH officially allows them to spend 20 percent of their
time investigating scientific fraud, Stewart said, he discovered in
1985 that his laboratory equipment at the National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases had been removed and
junked without notice.
   Stewart and Feder, whose work had always been judged
satisfactory, said they began getting unfavorable job evaluations,
which were reversed on appeal.
   Stewart said their troubles clearly stemmed from their inquiries
into fraudulent practices by NIH grant recipients.
   Another whistleblower who complained of mistreatment was Dr.
Jerome G. Jacobstein, who said ``I have been ignored by my friends,
vilified by my enemies, despised, hated, condemned and on a rare
but satisfying occasion, perhaps, respected.''
   Jacobstein alleged that Dr. Jeffrey S. Borer, a cardiologist and
Cornell University Medical College professor, attempted to induce a
student to make numerous misrepresentations in a joint scientific
study report. He said Borer ultimately got away with a mild rebuke.
   Jacobstein estimated that although extreme forms of research
fraud, such as wholesale fabrication of data, were ``fairly rare,''
an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent of research studies supported
by NIH grants contained unethically flawed data.
   ``A scientist who cheats injures other scientists by misleading
them, and he injures the public by wasting their money and
sometimes by falsely claiming discoveries that directly affect the
public health and welfare,'' Stewart and Feder said Monday in a
joint statement to the subcommittee.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Government
Operations panel, expressed sympathy for a suggestion by Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., that Congress should approve criminal penalties
for scientific fraud or misconduct because of its threat of
``incredible harm and injury to the public.''
   The whistleblowers, who also included Professor Robert L.
Sprague of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
complained that criminal penalties would be excessively harsh and
might create a damaging climate of fear among scientists.
   The witnesses all expressed hope that the scientific community
might find a way to improve internal safeguards against research
abuses. But Weiss said no one _ neither the NIH, the universities
receiving research grants nor professional scientific societies _
had shown willingness to solve the fraud problem.

   Police Chief Billy Prince, under fire from top
city officials for criticizing City Council members and opposing
police reforms, resigned today.
   Prince said he is stepping down immediately, and city manager
Richard Knight appointed first assistant police chief Louie C.
Caudell as interim chief, police Sgt. Carol Eberhardt said.
   ``I don't want to be a lame-duck leader or a lame-duck chief,''
said Prince. He said he will serve in an advisory role through the
summer.
   Prince, who has been chief for six years, said he is tired of
the battling between the community and his beleaguered department.
   ``I made this decision, after an 11-day vacation, on Easter
Sunday,'' Prince said at a news conference. ``I woke up Easter
Sunday and just didn't feel good about returning. I told my wife
then, `I think it's time for me to go.'''
   It wasn't one event that led to his decision, but ``I would not
be totally truthful if I said I liked the atmosphere we've been
working under. It's very trying and it wears you down.''
   Prince said he was not forced out of the $87,000 per-year job,
and said he will now concentrate on business interests.
   ``I'm 45 years old, and I feel I'm at a part of my life when if
I'm going to change, now's the time to do it,'' he said.
   Prince, a 24-year Dallas police veteran, has discussed his
resignation with Knight and other associates several times in the
last few weeks, officials said.
   His resignation comes at a time of tension between police and
the minority community. He has been caught between the demands of a
majority of the City Council, including Mayor Annette Strauss, who
want more police accountability, and the Dallas police union, which
opposes greater control.
   Some minority community leaders, including City Councilwoman
Diane Ragsdale and County Commissioner John Wiley Price, have
called for Prince's dismissal.
   City Councilman Jerry Rucker said he was angered by the reports
and called Prince a ``scapegoat for the mayor and the city
manager.''
   ``What a horrible thing for Dallas,'' Rucker said. ``I think
it's a tragedy for a man to be hounded out of his office by
demagogues.''
   Rucker, who has considered running for mayor, predicted Prince's
resignation would be an issue in the 1989 municipal elections.
   ``I think the people will finally say this is the last straw,''
Rucker said.
   Prince has been at odds with the City Council since late last
year, when Knight rebuked Prince for lobbying against police
reforms recommended by Mrs. Strauss' Advisory Committee on Crime.
   The aftermath of the Jan. 23 slaying of officer John Glenn Chase
by a vagrant in downtown parking lot put Prince on a collision
course with the city's elected leadership.
   Prince said some City Council members shared blame for Chase's
death because they had created an atmosphere of hostility toward
police.
   Mrs. Strauss asked Prince to retract his statements, which she
said heightened racial tensions, but he refused to back down.

   For those who won't wait until death do them part,
divorce counselor Sheila Davis has a word or two to ease hard
feelings.
   She asks divorcing couples to join hands and tell each other
something like: ``Goodbye. Thank you for the good times in our
marriage. I wish you luck in your new life. Our relationship will
continue as mother and father of our children, but not as husband
and wife.''
   Mrs. Davis works for the city of Birmingham as a divorce courts
welfare lawyer. Divorced and remarried herself, she says she
pioneered her ritual from personal experience.
   The wording of the farewell varies, depending on the
personalities involved. But the general idea is to help divorcing
parents come to terms with the split and be nice to each other,
especially when waging child custody battles.
   With 168,100 marital breakups in 1986, or three per 1,000
people, Britain has the highest rate of divorce in Western Europe.
Experts say one-third of British marriages are doomed to fail.
   Britain's tough marital law was reformed in 1971, changing
grounds for divorce from marital misconduct to irretrievable
breakdown. The divorce rate soared again after 1984, when the
waiting period for a divorce was reduced from three years to one.
   In Britain, communities provide free counseling to couples in
the throes of divorce. Mrs. Davis said she and 19 other advisers
under her command are all using her method.
   ``What I do is listen to the language,'' she said in a telephone
interview from the Birmingham office where she counsels estranged
couples.
   ``If I'm going to suggest the wording, I want to be sure it's
appropriate to the couple,'' she said.
   Often, she and the couple link hands for the ritual. ``Nine
times out of 10 we all end up in tears,'' she said.
   Renata Olins, director of a counseling organization called
London Marriage Guidance, said it was a good idea.
   ``When you get divorced you get a piece of paper through the
post. It's pretty bleak. So I think the idea of a ritual, a rite of
passage, sounds quite therapeutic. The paradox is that the
qualities you need to make the ending good are the same as those
you need to make a relationship good,'' she said in an interview.
   Sandra Boler, editor of the marriage magazine Brides, was less
sure of Mrs. Davis's approach. ``She's living in a charming
paradise,'' she told The Independent newspaper.
   In her experience, she said, ``most separating people are far
too angry with each other for a ceremony like that. Often women
have been ditched with young children, and they certainly are not
going to wish their partner good luck in a new life. It really is
rather unrealistic.''
   Mrs. Davis said: ``Some people think I'm in cuckoo land. Of
course, you can't do it with every single couple. Not every single
couple should go through it. I decide on the basis of working with
the couples.''
   She says the idea is catching on around the country, and last
year she lectured on it to marriage guidance counselors visiting
from North America.
   Occasionally, Mrs. Davis says, her ritual even can help rescue a
marriage. ``People can feel pretty silly saying the words.
Sometimes it prompts them to think again.''

<HEAD>Army Says Number of Leaking Weapons Likely to Grow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has more than 1,000 leaking chemical
weapons and the problem is likely to worsen in future years,
service officials said Tuesday.
   The leaking weapons are discovered by a complex series of
sensors at the eight U.S. sites where they are stored, witnesses
told the Senate Armed Services strategic weapons subcommittee.
   ``That's frightening, 1,000 leakers,'' said Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio. ``That's a serious problem ... the problem is not going to
get less'' as the weapons get even older.
   Army Brig. Gen. David Nydam estimated the number of leaking
weapons at ``more than 1,000,'' but added that the figure was only
``a small percentage'' of the total U.S. arsenal. He agreed with
Glenn's assessment that the situation will worsen as the stockpile
ages.
   Nydam said the exact size of the U.S. chemical arsenal is
classified. Published estimates have range from 25,000 to 40,000
tons, however.
   When leaking weapons are discovered, they are enclosed in larger
containers and then stored separately from the other weapons, Nydam
said.
   The weapons are stored in closed bunkers and are periodically
checked to see if any are leaking, Nydam said.
   Until recent months, the United States hadn't built any chemical
weapons since 1969 and the Army's stockpile is now on average more
than 25 years old. Unitary weapons include shells and bombs that
are filled with a variety of nerve gases and chemicals.
   As part of the Army's program of building new weapons, Congress
ordered the service to come up with a safe method for destruction
of the existing stockpile.
   The Army has told Congress that it prefers to build closed
incinerators at the eight U.S. sites because it is too dangerous to
move the weapons.
   The weapons are stored at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.;
Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.;
Newport Army Ammunition Plant, Ind.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.;
Pueblo Army Depot, Colo.; Tooele Army Depot, Utah; and Umatilla
Army Depot, Ore.
   The largest stockpile, 42 percent of the total, is stored at
Tooele. The list does not include U.S. weapons stationed in West
Germany or stored on Johnston Atoll, a deserted island 400 miles
south of Hawaii.
   John Shannon, assistant secretary of the Army, told the
subcommittee that the service is pushing ahead with plans to build
the incineration plants, despite some strong local opposition.
   Shannon said the criticism has come from communities around the
Aberdeen, Newport and Lexington plants. The other five ``have
expressed the desire that we get on with it,'' he said.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., criticized the Army for its approach to
swaying public opinion at the Newport site. ``There's been some
progress, but we've got a long way to go,'' he said.
   ``We in the Senate become involved when our constituency feels
it is short-changed,'' and that is the situation in Newport, Quayle
said.
   Shannon agreed, saying: ``We did not do a good job in Newport in
the beginning, we'll have to do better.''
   Shannon estimated the total cost of destruction at $2.7 billion
and said the job will be completed by 1997, if the plants go ahead
now.

   Police Chief Billy Prince, under fire from top
city officials for criticizing City Council members and opposing
police reforms, resigned today.
   Prince said he is stepping down immediately, and city manager
Richard Knight appointed first assistant police chief Louie C.
Caudell as interim chief, police Sgt. Carol Eberhardt said.
   ``I don't want to be a lame-duck leader or a lame-duck chief,''
said Prince. He said he will serve in an advisory role through the
summer.
   Prince, who has been chief for six years, said he is tired of
the battling between the community and his beleaguered department.
   ``I made this decision, after an 11-day vacation, on Easter
Sunday,'' Prince said at a news conference. ``I woke up Easter
Sunday and just didn't feel good about returning. I told my wife
then, `I think it's time for me to go.'''
   It wasn't one event that led to his decision, but ``I would not
be totally truthful if I said I liked the atmosphere we've been
working under. It's very trying and it wears you down.''
   Prince said he was not forced out of the $87,000 per-year job,
and said he will now concentrate on business interests.
   ``I'm 45 years old, and I feel I'm at a part of my life when if
I'm going to change, now's the time to do it,'' he said.
   Prince, a 24-year Dallas police veteran, has discussed his
resignation with Knight and other associates several times in the
last few weeks, officials said.
   His resignation comes at a time of tension between police and
the minority community. He has been caught between the demands of a
majority of the City Council, including Mayor Annette Strauss, who
want more police accountability, and the Dallas police union, which
opposes greater control.
   Some minority community leaders, including City Councilwoman
Diane Ragsdale and County Commissioner John Wiley Price, have
called for Prince's dismissal.
   City Councilman Jerry Rucker said he was angered by the reports
and called Prince a ``scapegoat for the mayor and the city
manager.''
   ``What a horrible thing for Dallas,'' Rucker said. ``I think
it's a tragedy for a man to be hounded out of his office by
demagogues.''
   Rucker, who has considered running for mayor, predicted Prince's
resignation would be an issue in the 1989 municipal elections.
   ``I think the people will finally say this is the last straw,''
Rucker said.
   Prince has been at odds with the City Council since late last
year, when Knight rebuked Prince for lobbying against police
reforms recommended by Mrs. Strauss' Advisory Committee on Crime.
   The aftermath of the Jan. 23 slaying of officer John Glenn Chase
by a vagrant in downtown parking lot put Prince on a collision
course with the city's elected leadership.
   Prince said some City Council members shared blame for Chase's
death because they had created an atmosphere of hostility toward
police.
   Mrs. Strauss asked Prince to retract his statements, which she
said heightened racial tensions, but he refused to back down.

<HEAD>Ozone-Destroying Chemicals To Be Gone From Food Containers Next
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Makers of plastic foam food containers will
stop using ozone-destroying chemicals in their products after this
year, the first industry to give up the compounds completely, their
trade association said Tuesday.
   Major environmental groups and the Environmental Protection
Agency hailed the decision by members of the Foodservice & Packing
Institute as an important symbolic step in persuading others to
find substitutes for the chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, compounds.
   Consumers will notice little impact because the the decision
does not mean an end to foam containers, valued for their lightness
and insulating properties _ things like egg cartons and the
clamshell hamburger containers used by fast-food chains. Two-thirds
of those foams currently are made without CFCs.
   There are about 15 companies making the food packages, said
Joseph W. Bow, president of the institute, and more than a third of
them have signed a letter pledging to give up CFCs by the end of
the year. ``In 30 days we should have the rest of the industry''
signed up, Bow said.
   About 1.5 percent to 2 percent of CFC use in the United States,
or 15 million pounds a year, goes to foam blowing agents for food
packages, though 30 percent is used in blowing agents for other
foams such as seat cushions and insulating panels. Gaseous CFCs are
released into the atmosphere during the foam manufacturing process
and some of the compounds also remain trapped in the foam, where
they may be released into the environment later.
   For environmentalists, though, the food packages were a visible
symbol of the threat to the Earth's protective ozone layer, and
they already had persuaded some fast food chains _ and the Senate
restaurant in Washington _ not to use CFC-derived containers.
   Ozone at high altitudes protects the Earth from cancer-causing
ultraviolet rays of the sun, but can be destroyed by chlorine
liberated from the breakup of CFC compounds at those altitudes.
   Last month the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
reported that CFCs appear to have been responsible for an average
2.3 percent decline in the ozone shield at northern hemisphere
mid-latitudes from 1969 to 1986.
   A treaty signed by 31 nations last fall requires a 50 percent
cut in CFC production by 1998.
   Most of the replacement for CFCs in foam packages is expected to
be a related compound, HCFC-22, which has only 5 percent of the
ozone-destroying ability of the chemicals being given up.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense
Fund and Friends of the Earth agreed to work with the packing
institute in finding an eventual replacement for HCFC-22.
   All three groups praised the industry, and EPA administrator Lee
M. Thomas issued a statement praising the ``welcome contribution''
of less CFC use as ``a model of cooperation between industry and
the environmental community.''
   The Environmental Defense Fund said the announcement was even
more significant than the Du Pont Co.'s announcement last month
that it wanted to end CFC production because Du Pont did not commit
itself to a deadline the way the institute did.
   ``It is our intention to go to other sectors (of the economy)
and say, `These guys did it; so can you,''' said David Doniger,
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Current non-CFC blowing agents, mostly volatile hydrocarbons
like pentane, pose environmental threats of their own since these
compounds help form ozone at low altitudes, where it is a pollutant.
   The substitute material costs 25 percent to 50 percent more than
the compounds it replaces, but lasts longer, so costs will be
increased little if at all, Bow said.

<HEAD>Jackson Draws Crowds in Harlem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic presidential candidate's stroll
through Harlem was unannounced but word swept the streets _ ``It's
Jesse Jackson!''
   Children scampered up to touch him, women in curlers called out
from upper-story windows, youths in jeans and basketball shoes
hollered from the street, and old men hobbled over to see him walk
by.
   It was an impromptu walk down Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard from
the renowned Abyssinian Baptist Church where he had preached on
Sunday morning to Sylvia's restaurant 15 minutes away.
   ``Go Jesse,'' the crowds shouted.
   ``You've got my vote.''
   ``Jesse, I pray for you,'' said one old lady.
   It was an incongruous sight. Jackson, tall and crisply attired
in dark blue suit, beamed as he walked hand in hand with his wife,
Jacqueline, their son Jonathan astride. The candidate all but
disappeared except for his head as he was swallowed by a gaggle of
reporters and cameras, a phalanx of police officers and a team of
Secret Service agents.
   They walked a street lined with trash, gutted buildings,
dilapidated stores and apartments, beat-up cars and broken
sidewalks.
   But the street came alive with Harlem residents. In their
excitement over Jackson, they bumped into security agents, running
alongside and behind his entourage as if he were the Pied Piper.
   There seemed to be a sense that Jackson was on home turf here.
   Speaking at the Abyssinian Church earlier, Jackson called the
church's pastor, Sam Proctor, his mentor. He recalled that Proctor
and he had many discussions about the missions of the late Adam
Clayton Powell, the local congressman who gained fame as the
eloquent pastor of the same church, and about civil rights leader
Martin Luther King.
   Jackson told the congregation there is still ``unfinished
business'' in the agenda set by King, that poor people are still
hungry and peace is still elusive.
   On his walk later, Jackson hugged passersby and lifted children.
   ``How you doin' brother,'' he called out.
   He approached a basketball court and some 15 young men raced to
the chain-link fence around it. He couldn't shake their hands
through the fence, but they pressed their palms against one side
and he put his against the other. They tossed him their ball, and
he threw it back over the fence as they cheered wildly.
   ``I'm not going to wash my hand no more in my life,'' one
middle-aged woman gushed after touching Jackson.
   A sidewalk bookseller told him, ``I sold out of your book.''
   Two young women called to his wife that she was ``so lucky'' to
have such an attractive husband. One of them shouted to Jackson,
``You're gonna win, you handsome devil.''
   Jackson laughed as a boy of about 10 took his hand and chattered
about his family and point out where his relatives lived.
   Someone pointed out two tall palm trees in a deserted lot that
were stripped of their fronds, painted crazily and had basketball
hoops suspended about 30 feet in the air.
   ``Ain't no goal too high, right Jesse?'' said a man following
the candidate.

   Chinese leaders on Tuesday elected a new cabinet
in a vote that indicates a general support for Deng Xiaoping's
economic reforms although several conservatives received key posts.
   Qian Qichen, 60, a career diplomat who has been China's chief
negotiator with the Soviet Union, was elected as minister of
Foreign Affairs, succeeding Wu Xueqian, 67.
   Gen. Qin Jiwei, 74, a member of the Communist Party Politburo
and commander of the Beijing Military Region, took over the Defense
Ministry from ailing Zhang Aiping, 78.
   Continuing an unprecedented movement started at the beginning of
congress, delegates at the National People's Congress actually
voted against some of the cabinet candidates.
   In congresses past, all candidates were elected unanimously.
   The congress, which is China's legislature, also passed two
amendments to the constitution. One guarantees the rights of
private businessmen, while the other recognizes the transfer of
land-use rights, opening the way for the leasing of property.
   In voting by 2,859 delegates, the congress approved three vice
premiers, nine state councillors and 41 ministers for the State
Council, or cabinet. The stress was on continuity, with the large
majority of ministers either keeping their jobs or turning them
over to people within their organizations.
   The State Council is headed by Li Peng, 59, who was formally
endorsed as premier earlier in the congress' annual session.
   Named as vice premiers were Yao Yilin and Tian Jiyun, both
returnees, and the outgoing foreign minister, Wu.
   The delegates were not given a choice in who they could pick for
each office, although they could oppose the candidate or abstain
from voting.
   The one surprise was the election of Li Guixian, a
Soviet-trained engineer and party boss in Anhui province, to be
governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
   Li, with no known financial background, will be responsible for
the major task of reforming China's inflexible banking system to
allow interest rates to replace central planning in the management
of the bank.
   According to New Evening Post a Hong Kong daily, he received 404
opposing votes and 29 abstentions, more than any other candidate.
   As head of the Defense Ministry, Qin, one of Deng's confidantes,
is expected to carry out Deng's plan to mold the Defense Ministry
into a more powerful body.
   The ministry is now the weak sister to party and state military
commissions both headed by Deng.
   Qian, the new foreign minister, is expected to follow closely
the policies laid down by Wu, foreign minister since 1982.
   China in that period has steadily expanded economic and
political ties with the West while gradually easing tensions with
the Soviet Union.
   The official news agency Xinhua described the new government as
``a group of technocrats who are younger in age, pragmatic and
enthusiastic in the reform.''
   It said the average age of the cabinet dipped from 62 to 59 and
that all but five members are college graduates.
   Premier Li, a Soviet-trained engineer who is considered
conservative when compared to Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang,
took over the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy.
   Senior Vice Premier Yao, who also wants to slow the pace of
reform, was named head of the new State Planning Commission.
   One constitutional amendment guarantees the rights and interests
of the 21.5 million Chinese now engaged in 13.7 million private
businesses. Private entrepreneurs, operating small food and
clothing stalls and restaurants, now account for almost 13 percent
of the nation's total retail sales.
   The other amendment, also tied to China's policy of giving
greater flexibility to its economy, states that ``the right to the
use of land may be transferred according to law.''
   China has experimented with transfer of land-use rights as part
of efforts to provide land to more ambitious farmers and accelerate
urban development.
   The congress, which closes Wednesday, has been hailed as the
most democratic in history, with delegates encouraged to speak out
on such issues as inflation and faltering agricultural production.

   Limousines were bumper-to-bumper
on Sunset Boulevard early today as celebrities made their way to
two big post-Oscar parties.
   Hollywood glamor mixed with political activism at a benefit for
Central American refugees that drew such stars as Rosanna Arquette,
Morgan Fairchild and Nicholas Cage to the ultra-modern Le Mondrian
Hotel.
   Meanwhile literary agent Swifty Lazar's annual bash drew a crowd
at the trendy Spago restaurant.
   About 600 people paid $500 each to attend the Le Mondrian
fund-raiser for El Escerte, an organization that provides board,
food and medical care for Central American refugees.
   Outdoors at poolside under a glittering night sky, Ms. Fairchild
and Ms. Arquette chatted as the head of the Stallone clan,
outspoken Jacqueline Stallone, swept through with her non-Rambo
son, Frank.
   Nicholas Cage of ``Moonstruck'' stopped by after midnight,
joining such other partygoers as Olivia Hussey, Tina Yothers and
John Amos.
   ``I wanted to get into the spirit of the Oscars. It's fun and
exciting,'' said Miss Hussey, whose films include ``Romeo and
Juliet.''
   ``I'm here to raise money for Central American refugees. It's a
very good cause,'' said Miss Arquette, who has appeared in such
films as ``Silverado,'' ``Desperately Seeking Susan'' and ``The
Executioner's Song.''
   Esai Morales, who played rock singer Ritchie Valens' brother in
the film ``La Bamba,'' was co-chairman of the event.
   ``This is an Oscar party with a conscience,'' said another
co-chairman, 22-year-old producer Dan Sladek. ``Swifty's represents
old Hollywood. This crowd represents a new generation of young
Hollywood who are socially committed, who go to an Oscar party and
pay for it, rather than crash it.''
   But although glitter was not in short supply at Le Mondrian, the
main event was still at Spago, where the scene was nearly as
glamorous as the Oscars ceremony itself. Many of Hollywood's
glitterati watched the telecast at the balloon and
streamer-bedecked restaurant rather than brave rush-hour traffic to
the Shrine Auditorium 10 miles away.
   Among the celebrities in attendance at the invitation-only fete
were Roger Moore, Neil Simon, Henry Mancini, Don Rickles, Bob
Newhart and Suzanne Pleshette. Sean Connery, Best Supporting Oscar
in hand, dropped in after the ceremony.

<TEXT>
   The government may move troops from a
formerly embattled western province to Mozambique, where they would
fight right-wing rebels, the defense minister said Tuesday.
   The soldiers were sent to Matabeleland province six years ago to
hunt down armed dissidents.
   However, rebel activity has vanished there since President
Robert Mugabe and former opposition leader Joshua Nkomo signed a
unity accord Dec. 22, Defense Minister Enos Nkala told the Zimbabwe
Inter-African News Agency.
   The dissidents battled for Nkomo in the seven-year war that
transformed white-ruled Rhodesia into black-governed Zimbabwe on
April 18, 1980. However, they left the army two years later to
fight the new government, killing hundreds of black peasants and
more than 60 whites.
   The parties of Nkomo and Mugabe last week approved a merger
expected to lead to one-party rule by Mugabe's Zimbabwe African
National Union.
   The defense chief said the government could plan for withdrawing
soldiers from Matabeleland and deploying them instead to assist the
government of neighboring Mozambique.
   About 12,000 of Mugabe's troops are in Mozambique guarding trade
routes and an oil pipeline vital to landlocked Zimbabwe's economy.
The military chief did not say how many troops might be moved.
   The area is threatened by rebels fighting the government of
Marxist President Joaquim Chissano.

<TEXT>
   Ex-Gov. Evan Mecham's brief administration
has sparked the historical interest of both the Smithsonian
Institution and the Arizona Historical Society.
   Mecham, a first-term Republican in office just over a year, was
removed from office April 4 when the state Senate convicted him of
two impeachment charges. He also was the subject of recall drive
and faces a May 19 trial on criminal charges accusing him of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The state society's Central Division is building an extensive
collection of material relating to recall him, Andy Masich,
division director, said Monday.
   The Smithsonian's interest began about a month ago. Larry Bird,
curator of the Division of Political History of the institution's
National Museum of American History, asked a Tucson museum official
to send him a bumper sticker and a couple of campaign buttons
commemorating the campaign against Mecham.
   ``Normally, our contemporary collection is limited to national
politics,'' Bird said in a telephone interview. ``But this is a
relatively unusual event.''
   Diane Dittemore, curator of the Arizona State Museum in Tucson,
said she sent Bird a bumper sticker reading ``King Had A Dream,
Arizona Has A Nightmare,'' and two buttons, a red-and-white one
saying ``Mecham Watchdog Committee,'' and a yellow-and-black one
reading ``Recall Ev.''
   Edith Richardson, Mecham's campaign manager, said of the
Smithsonian's acquisition:``I think it's rather sad for an
institution we all regard so highly to display such material.''
   Bird, who studied at the University of Arizona, said he wasn't
sure that the recall material would become a part of the museum's
permanent collection.
   ``We asked for the memorabilia as a matter of routine,'' he
said. ``It's not as if we're making a federal case out of it. Any
scholar who wants to study the phenomenon of the Arizona recall is
more likely to contact a museum there for material than the
Smithsonian.''
   Masich said the society contacted the recall headquarters before
it closed and got an extensive donation of campaign materials.
   ``I'm sure we'll be collecting a lot more,'' he added.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today
sharply criticized his predecessor, Larry Speakes, for falsely
attributing remarks to President Reagan and vowed that he would
never follow such a practice himself.
   ``It's a damned outrage, that's what it is,'' Fitzwater told
reporters at his regular daily briefing.
   When reporters bombarded Fitzwater with questions about Speakes'
statements, made in his book ``Speaking Out,'' the spokesman said
the questions illustrated ``why I resent it so much.''
   ``To make up quotes casts aspersions on the presidency and on my
position and the questions you just asked are the best reasons why
it`s wrong, why he shouldn't have done it and why I won`t do it,''
he said.
   ``Everyone is appalled that he made up quotes,'' Fitzwater added.
   Fitzwater said he takes notes during presidential meetings and,
``If he didn't say it, I won't say he said it. I never have.''
   Fitzwater said he had not talked to the president about the
matter, but ``I am sure he would be upset about it. I am sure he
is.''
   The spokesman also said he had not talked with Mark Weinberg, an
assistant press secretary who Speakes said helped him make up
quotations to attribute to Reagan during his 1985 summit meeting
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva.
   ``I don't know what his role was there,'' he said of Weinberg.
``Clearly he was doing what Larry wanted, and he would not do
anything that I do not want him to do.''
   Fitzwater was a deputy under Speakes, but had left the White
House and was Vice President George Bush's press secretary at the
time of the incidents described by the former spokesman.
   Speakes, interviewed by telephone from New York, had no reaction
to Fitzwater's statement. ``I'd be better off not to comment,'' he
said.
   But he offered no apoligies, saying ``It's an honest book.''
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman, asked about the
practice of making up quotes, said, ``I don't do it.''
   Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, talking
to reporters after an hour-long meeting of conservatives with the
president, said, ``I think that the president is ill-served by all
of these people who are in public service and then write books the
minute they get out and reveal things that ought not to be
revealed.''
   ``I don`t condone the kind of self-serving, `I really was the
president' type attitude of Mike Deaver and Speakes and all the
rest,'' Weyrich said. ``All they're in it for is making a buck ...
and frankly, they ought to be ashamed of themselves.''
   Speakes says in his book that after a Korean Air Lines plane
carrying 61 Americans was shot down in 1983, he credited statements
made by Secretary of State George Shultz to Reagan.
   And he says that during Reagan's summit meeting with Gorbachev
in Geneva he attributed to Reagan remarks that he and Weinberg had
manufactured.
   Speakes said today the two instances he mentions of manufactured
quotes ``were the only two that I specifically recall that we did.
It was a case of knowing the president well and knowing how he felt
about the events taking place and knowing what he would say.''
   The former spokesman also said he had informed Reagan of the
made-up quotes.
   ``I generally told him, you know, what I had done, you know, and
the reasons for doing it. He never objected to, you know, these
cases where I said, you know, I've gone ahead and done this,''
Speakes said.
   Speakes often boasted that he never lied to the press during his
six years as Reagan's chief spokesman. His book is scheduled for
publication next month by Charles Scribner's Sons.
   Reagan met with the National Security Council and with
congressional leaders after a Soviet plane shot down the KAL
aircraft on Aug. 31, 1983.
   Speakes says Shultz declared during the congressional leaders'
meeting that the incident was not a problem between the United
States and the Soviet Union but ``a Soviet versus the world
problem.''
   ``Since the president had had almost nothing to say during the
National Security and congressional leadership meetings, I made
presidential quotes out of Shultz' comment about the incident
pitting the whole world against the Soviet Union, as well as some
of Shultz' suggestions about what retaliatory steps we should
take,'' Speakes writes.
   ``My decision to put Shultz' words in Reagan's mouth played well
and neither of them complained.''
   In his account ofthe Geneva summit, Speakes says he ``felt that
Gorbachev was really getting the advantage over us in his
give-and-take with reporters, while Reagan was very tentative and
stilted'' in his comments.
   ``Fearing that Reagan was losing the media version of Star Wars,
I instructed Mark Weinberg to draft some quotes for the
president,'' Speakes says. ``I polished the quotes and told the
press that while the two leaders stood together at the end of one
session, the president said to Gorbachev, `There is much that
divides us, but I believe the world breathes easier because we are
talking here together.'''
   Speakes says that CBS used the quote in its evening television
news and Chris Wallace of NBC reported ``the talks were frank. The
president's best statement came off camera, aides quoting him as
saying, `The world breathes easier because we are talking
together.'''
   ``Another Reagan quote which we manufactured that received
extensive play in the press was, `Our differences are serious but
so is our commitment to improving understanding,''' Speakes writes.
   ``In retrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,''
the former spokesman says in his account of the Geneva meeting.
``Certainly, Reagan would not have disavowed the words, but the
Soviets could have said they never heard anything like that.
Luckily, the Russians didn't dispute the quotes and I had been able
to spruce up the president's image by taking a bit of liberty with
my PR man's license.''
   In an interview published today in The Washington Post, Speakes
said that making up presidential quotes ``is not lying.''
   ``When you're a press secretary, you develop a bond of
understanding with the president so that you think like the
president,'' he said. ``I knew those quotes were the way he felt.''

<HEAD>Committee Will Let Senate Decide on Mexican Drug Efforts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharply divided Senate Foreign Relations
Committee refused to slap Mexico on Tuesday over its failings in
the war on drugs, leaving that decision to the full Senate, where
it could come to a vote in the next few days.
   The panel did approve a similar resolution condemning the
Bahamas for not doing enough to combat drug trafficking, and moved
to add Haiti to the list of countries that should come under
increased scrutiny as drug producing or transit points. The vote on
the Bahamas issue was 10-6, and the Haiti resolution passed on a
voice vote.
   The Reagan admnistration last month certified that Mexico and
the Bahamas are ``fully cooperating'' with U.S. efforts to halt
drug trafficking. Such a certification is required for any foreign
country identified as a drug producing or transit point to continue
to receive U.S. aid and other benefits.
   But Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., objected to the Mexico
certification, pointing to continued high rates of marijuana and
cocaine flowing into the United States from that country and
problems with official corruption and lack of cooperation with U.S.
drug interdiction authorities.
   Wilson proposed a resolution to decertify Mexico, which could
subject it to aid, lending and trade sanctions under U.S. law.
   The Foreign Relations panel, after lengthy debate over the
effect of such a move on overall U.S. relations with Mexico,
defeated an effort to send the bill to the floor with a favorable
recommendation. The vote was an 8-8 tie, which defeated the motion
under committee rules.
   In effect, the action left the decision to the full Senate,
since the bill has priority status and must go to the floor for
final action in any case.
   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who has been holding hearings on
Latin American drug trafficking, said the move represented a
victory in the war on drugs. ``It reflects the changing mood and
dynamic in Congress,'' Kerry said, noting that several senators had
switched sides on the issue in light of a growing awareness of the
drug problem.
   Kerry predicted a hard-fought debate when the measure comes to
the floor later this week or next week, and said he could not
predict the outcome.
   The measure is primarily symbolic in its impact on foreign aid,
since Mexico's only current U.S. aid is $14.5 million in money to
combat drugs, money which would be unaffected by any sanctions.
   More important for Mexico, however, could be a requirement that
the United States oppose future loans from international
development banks. The United States has a weighted vote in
decisions on such loans, but not a majority.
   Decertification also could expose Mexico to various trade
sanctions, at the discretion of the president.
   Arguing for the Mexico resolution, Kerry noted that the
administration itself had noted numerous failings by Mexico when it
certified full cooperation on March 1, noting that a ``higher
level'' of cooperation was needed. ``You can't have it both ways,''
Kerry said.
   ``The point has really arrived where other countries are
watching us,'' he said, noting that Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, indicted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges, seems to be drawing strength from U.S. confusion over its
policy toward him.
   But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said Mexico already is
devoting large proportions of its national budget to fighting drug
trafficking and that decertification would destroy that cooperation.
   ``They're doing a great deal,'' Dodd said. ``This is a slap in
the face that's going to set us in the wrong direction. ... If this
resolution is adopted, you can expect the worst kind of
cooperation.''

   The United States today recommended a massive,
U.N.-sponsored effort to help Afghanistan's estimated eight million
refugees ``return in safety and honor'' as Soviet troops withdraw.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the United
States was prepared to help plan the return of the Afghans, most of
whom fled to Pakistan to escape Soviet attacks, but he said ``the
United Nations and its specialized agencies are the logical
organizations to coordinate the job.''
   Redman said that ``a constructive effort is taking place to work
out an interim government and to help the refugees return in safety
and honor.''
   He said there was no timetable for the return of the refugees
and added:
   ``This process has to be done in such a way that it's done
securly, that these people are taken care of. There is obviously
going to be some social disorganization inside Afghanistan as this
proceeds. We need to try to do this in a coordinated way.''
   The return of the Afghan refugees and the withdrawal of Soviet
troops are envisioned in a four-part accord that Afghanistan,
Pakistan and the Afghan rebels are scheduled to sign on Thursday.
   Although White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
at a briefing that Reagan's conservative supporters were ``very
supportive and very happy'' with the Afghan agreement, a group of
conservative leaders met with the president for an hour today and
expressed concerns about the pact.
   ``We think the administration is well-intentioned, but we
question the results,'' Paul Weyrich, president of the Free
Congress Foundation, said afterwards.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz acknowledged it will be
difficult to end the fighting even after the Soviets leave the
country, but he predicted the withdrawal will bring some stability
to the war-torn nation.
   ``I ... expect that the Soviet Union will withdraw fully from
Afghanistan, and then the people of Afghanistan have got to work
things out,'' Shultz said. ``That's their right and their problem.''
   The secretary met with reporters after President Reagan
announced on Monday that he was dispatching Shultz to Geneva to
sign the troop-withdrawal accords negotiated last week between
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Reagan lauded the U.S.-backed rebels, who have battled the Kabul
regime since the 1979 Soviet invasion.
   ``This development would not have been possible had it not been
for the valiant struggle of the Afghan people to rid their country
of foreign occupation,'' Reagan said. ``We take great pride in
having assisted the Afghan people in this triumph and they can
count on our continued support.''
   Asked about charges from conservatives that the agreement is a
sellout of the rebels, Reagan replied, ``We are not.''
   Under the agreement, the United States and Soviet Union will
guarantee a plan dictating the removal of the Red Army's 115,000
troops from Afghanistan.
   The plan has been worked out under the auspices of the United
Nations and is expected to be signed on Thursday.
   The pullout is set to begin May 15, only two weeks before Reagan
is scheduled to fly to Moscow for his fourth summit session with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The rebels, or mujahedeen, were not part of the talks. They have
rejected the agreement and pledged to continue fighting to topple
the Kabul government.
   Yet under a compromise with Moscow that is not a formal part of
the accords, the United States will continue sending weapons to the
rebels, while the Kremlin continues providing arms to the Marxist
government.
   Asked if U.S. pledges to continue supporting the rebels
contradict the formal agreement, Shultz replied only, ``I'm not
going to step into that hole.''
   He said the United States would continue to aid the rebels ``as
needed.''
   ``We have stood by the Afghan people during this 8{ years and
we're prepared to stand by them in the coming months to help
Afghans return home and begin rebuilding their lives and their
country,'' he added.
   Reagan called the agreement ``historic,'' while Shultz hailed it
as ``a major ... international success.''
   ``This is the first time in the history of the Soviet Union that
they have moved by aggression into another country and then had to
withdraw,'' Shultz said.
   The secretary acknowledged that the removal of Soviet troops
will not necessarily mean an end to the fighting between the Kabul
regime and the rebels. He said he expected the U.N. mediator, Diego
Cordovez, to ``do everything he can to develop an interim
government.''
   ``We know it's not easy,'' Shultz said. ``It will be hard.''
   But on Capitol Hill, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., denounced the
agreement as amounting to a ``slow-motion sellout'' of the
resistance fighters.
   ``It's a poor deal, a very bad deal,'' he said. ``The Soviets
are perfectly free under this agreement to resupply the communist
puppet regime in Kabul just as lavishly as they please.''
   The accord calls for the return to Afghanistan of millions of
Afghan refugees, most of whom moved to neighboring Pakistan.
   ``Undoubtedly there will be a massive movement of refugees from
outside Afghanistan into Afghanistan, by the millions,'' Shultz
said. ``So, there will be immense social dislocation and potential
for suffering, and we and others in the international community
will want to do everything we can to ease that transition.''
   The United States has urged the appointment of a special U.N.
coordinator to oversee repatriation.
   ``In our view, the Soviet Union, having inflicted so much
suffering on the Afghan people, has a special obligation to provide
resources for this resettlement,'' Shultz said.
   Under the accord, some 50 percent of the Soviet forces are to be
removed over a three-month period beginning in May. All remaining
Soviet forces are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Shultz said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has
promised to complete the withdrawal by the end of the year, ahead
of the deadline. He said the United States will ``push for that and
expect that.''

<HEAD>No Disciplinary Action Taken Against Priest Over Celibacy Comment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Archdiocese of Atlanta said Tuesday it will
not take disciplinary action against a priest at a suburban Roman
Catholic parish who said Pope John Paul II is ``dead wrong'' on the
issue of celibacy.
   The Rev. Anthony Curran ``was very gracious in acknowledging the
inaccuracy of some of his statements'' during a meeting with
Monsignor John F. McDonough at the archdiocese offices, said the
Rev. Peter Dora.
   Dora, communications director for the archdiocese, said Curran
could have been suspended from his priestly functions as punishment.
   Curran, a priest for 21 years, told his parishioners at Stone
Mountain's Corpus Christi Catholic Church last weekend that the
doctrine of priestly celibacy leads to alcoholism and other
aberrant behavior.
   Dora said the archdiocese had received ``numerous complaints
from parishioners'' about Curran's comments.
   Curran, 46, is associate pastor at Corpus Christi, which was
rocked last week by the indictment of a former priest for child
molestation and other offenses involving four altar boys.
   Dora said Curran will draft a letter to his parishioners
clarifying his statements, and after McDonough approves the letter
it will be read at Masses over the weekend.
   ``The diocese had problems with a priest using the pulpit to
address his own opinions and concerns. That was the central issue
as far as the diocese was concerned,'' Dora said. ``The question of
celibacy will continue to be discussed openly and seriously within
the Catholic Church within the appropriate settings.''
   Curran said Monday in a telephone interview that his parish's
crisis ``is of a much larger context'' than charges against one
priest.
   ``I think the real issue is, when will the church deal with the
truth of all the pain of celibacy as the clergy experience it?''

   A Soviet reporter was barred from this
gambling and entertainment capital for 16 years because of nearby
military installations and the nuclear test site. Now that he's
seen it, he's less than impressed.
   The lights on the Las Vegas Strip are so bright ``you can read a
newspaper at 3 a.m. _ that is, provided you don't care if people
take you for an idiot,'' Vitaly Gan, a correspondent for the
Communist Party newspaper Pravda, wrote in a profile published
Monday in the Los Angeles Times and Las Vegas Review-Journal.
   He referred to the city's slot machines, commonly known as
``one-armed bandits,'' as ``one-legged bandits.''
   He described the Strip as ``an orgy of buildings, arches,
fountains, statues and ads, striking the eye with the abandon and
wanton nature of the merry-making going on there. All this rolls
before your eyes in a searing ball of fire, 24 hours a day.''
   Gan visited the city briefly in January when Soviet scientists
visited the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas,
studying ways to verify a nuclear test ban.
   He was especially unimpressed with the city's main industry.
   ``People know that gambling is one of the silliest inventions of
mankind,'' Gan said.

   One man's idea of progress can be another

   Architects admire the new, streamlined toll booths at the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
   ``We thought we were doing the best we could,'' said CalTrans
architect Doug Lowe, who believes the old toll booths looked like
``phone booths in the middle of a freeway.''
   The people who have to work inside the booths aren't so
enthusiastic, because their work space is only 20 inches wide. The
old ones were nearly a yard wide.
   ``I hate them. When you have two people inside to take over
shifts, it really is impossible,'' said toll collector Robert
Montgomery.
   ``I doubt whether any one of us likes the new booths,'' said
toll collector John Harris, 57, who has served on the 8.5-mile span
since 1955. ``It's just too cramped for a person to stay in there
6{ hours a day.''

<TEXT>
   Frankfurt officials said today
that Mohammed Ali Hamadi, charged with air piracy and murder in the
1985 TWA hijacking to Beirut, will be tried before a juvenile court.
   The decision by the Frankfurt state court means the 23-year-old
Hamadi faces a maximum of 10 years imprisonment if convicted. If
tried as an adult, Hamadi could have received life imprisonment if
found guilty.
   Hamadi's trial had been expected to begin at the end of May,
officials said last week. Today's decision made no mention of a
date, although it indicated the start of the trial might be delayed.
   ``The Hesse state youth court will now need time to study the
case files before it can decide on when Mohammed Hamadi's trial
will start,'' the court statement said.
   The statement, telexed to news media, said the state
prosecutor's office in Frankfurt had listed Hamadi's birth date as
June 13, 1964.
   ``However, a possibility exists that the perpetration of the
crime that he is accused of may have begun before June 13, 1985,
and goes back to the time of his adolescence.
   ``Therefore, the case has been turned over to the youth court,''
the statement said.
   A federal Justice Ministry spokesman said the juvenile court
could decide to exclude the press from Hamadi's trial.
   ``The press can be excluded from the trial if the court finds it
is in the best interest of the accused,'' said the spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the decision on whether to
bar the press would not be made until the trial begins.
   The charges against Hamadi stem from a hijacking that began June
15, 1985. On that day, Shiite Moslem gunmen seized a TWA jetliner
on an Athens-to-Rome flight and forced it to Beirut, Lebanon. One
American, a U.S. Navy diver, was killed during the hijacking and 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days before being released.
   Abbas Hamadi, 29, is on trial on charges of kidnapping two West
Germans in an attempt to force authorities to release his brother,
who was arrested at Frankfurt airport Jan. 13, 1987, carrying
liquid explosives and false documents.
   The United States sought Mohammed Hamadi's extradition on air
piracy and murder charges. But West Germany refused after the two
Germans were kidnapped in Lebanon.
   One West German was freed in September. The other remains a
captive.

<TEXT>
   School teacher Terry Weeks has donned the garb
of a terrorist to get his seventh-grade students in Murfreesboro,
Tenn., to grapple with viewpoints diametrically opposed to their
own.
   He also has posed as Andrew Jackson and Anwar Sadat to bring
history alive in his classroom.
   On Tuesday, Weeks assumed a new role that he will play for the
next 12 months: the 1988 National Teacher of the Year.
   The 37-year-old social studies instructor from Central Middle
School in Murfreesboro appeared on national television and held a
news conference to kick off a celebratory week that includes a stop
at the White House on Thursday to receive a crystal apple from
President Reagan.
   For Weeks, who makes $25,000 after 15 years in the classroom, it
was a taste of adulation he said he wished all teachers could share.
   ``I wish somehow I could bundle it all up and as I go across the
country this next year, just kind of spread it out to the
teachers,'' he said. ``They need to know that there are news
cameras waiting on the teacher of the year when he gets off of a
plane, people wanting to know how he teaches ... and what is it
that keeps him in the classroom.''
   He also told reporters, ``I can't do the moon walk. I can't slam
dunk a basketball. ... I'm a teacher.''
   But Weeks, a director of the Tennessee Education Association and
former president of his union local, also complained of low
salaries and poor working conditions for public school teachers.
   ``Teachers by far represent the best bargain going for this
country,'' said Weeks. ``Teachers need to have more control over
what happens in the schools,'' including the curriculum, schedule
and choice of textbooks.
   ``We are secretaries, we are filing clerks, we are
psychologists, we have to be legal scholars, we can't go to the
bathroom every time we need to go because there are 30 children in
the classroom,'' he said.
   Weeks, whose wife, Mary, is a nurse, said he has stayed in the
classroom despite low pay because every day ``I know I've had the
opportunity to make a difference'' in the lives of 150 students.
``To me there's no more noble calling than teaching. But again,
that's not to say I'm satisfied with the low salary.''
   Weeks, a carpenter's son, is a graduate of Middle Tennessee
State University. He has been the seventh grade social studies
teacher at Central Middle School for 14 years.
   He said his posing as a terrorist, and other historical figures,
is all aimed at forcing his students to think and not just memorize
things.
   ``Nothing's simple any more. There's no yes-no answers any
longer. Instead of just basic skills, I want to get to the depth to
help them compare, contrast,'' he said. ``When I'm gone the
problems we have today won't be the problems they will face, but
the skills will enable them to deal with the problems. That's my
main goal as a teacher.''
   The teacher of the year competition is sponsored by the Council
of Chief State School Officers, the Encylclopaedia Britannica Cos.
and Good Housekeeping magazine.

   For the dozens of passengers who began
their second week as captives inside a sweltering jetliner, Flight
422 has become a journey of terror with mounting physical and
psychological tensions.
   The blue-and-white Boeing 747 was hijacked over India on a
flight from Bangkok to Kuwait eight days ago, but some of the
hostages have lost track of time.
   ``It's been 10 days,'' complained passenger Ahmed al-Gabandi,
who was put on the radio Tuesday by the hijackers to beg for the
release 17 pro-Iranian bombers imprisoned in Kuwait, the
terrorists' main demand.
   ``This is what we're all waiting for,'' he said plaintively.
``We all want to go home.''
   The Boeing landed at Larnaca Friday after a harrowing flight
from Mashhad in northeast Iran. The veteran Iraqi pilot, Capt.
Youssef Subhi, 53, frantically radioed he was running out of fuel
after he was refused permission to touch down at Beirut and
Damascus.
   Since then, the Shiite hijackers, armed with guns and grenades,
have repeatedly demanded that the jumbo jet be refueled.
   Two captives, their hands tied behind their backs, have been
shot in the head and their bodies pushed out of the jet onto the
tarmac of the beachside runway.
   ``The hostages inside the jet must be terrified, wondering who
will be next,'' said a Cypriot air traffic controller, one of a
team assigned to maintain contact with the hijackers. He asked that
his name not be used.
   ``Every time the hijackers set a new deadline, each passenger
must fear that maybe he'll be the one the hijackers pick on when
it's not met.''
   Passenger Fadel Khaled al-Sabah, a businessman and cousin of
Kuwait's emir, Shieik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, could barely talk
when the hijackers put him on the radio to plead for fuel.
   ``We depend on God for our fate,'' he said in a strained voice
after reciting a verse from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   When he suddenly broke off, the tower asked what was wrong. One
of the hijackers snapped back in broken English: ``He is sick. He
cannot hold his food. He is vomiting.''
   The hijackers have reported that several other captives were
ailing, but given no details. Two nights ago, one gunman requested
Maalox Suspension, an antacid medicine, painstakingly spelling out
the name so the tower got it right. He did not say who it was for.
   One of the four negotiators, who was allowed to step inside the
plane once, said he briefly spoke to al-Sabah's sister, Ebtesam,
who with another sister, Anware, are the only women aboard.
   Ebtesam had blood smeared under her nose. Asked how it got
there, the woman said: ``I had a nosebleed. It's because I'm
nervous and the air is so dry in here.''
   The 42-year-old flight engineer, Ayed Eid Ali Shamlan, who was
hijacked once before in 1984, reported the sky pirates have beaten
some of the passengers.
   Doctors at Larnaca morgue reported that both men who were killed
had been badly beaten before they were shot by the hijackers, who
have threatened to continue a ``slow and quiet massacre'' of their
captives.
   ``The conditions inside the plane must be harrowing by now,''
said the controller, a veteran of several hijacks on this east
Mediterranean island that because of its location, only 100 miles
from Lebanon, has become a crossroads for terrorists in the Middle
East.
   ``During the day it must be like a Turkish bath.''
   The hijackers repeatedly demanded mobile generators to power the
air conditioning system and reported Tuesday that the temperature
inside the main cabin soared to 104 degrees Fahrenheit when a
generator ran out of fuel.
   ``Hurry up! Hurry up!'' one hijacker snapped to the tower as he
waited for a new generator to be rolled up.
   ``Is is hot in there?'' the tower asked.
   ``Yes it is,'' the hijacker snarled. ``It's only 30 degrees (86
Fahrenheit) outside.''
   The controller noted: ``That's the first time I've heard him
display any emotion. Usually they're calm, very matter-of-fact,
even when they've just killed a hostage.
   ``They rarely raise their voices. They seem well-educated and at
least one is well-versed technically. They're the coolest customers
I've encountered.''
   The window shades are drawn 24 hours a day. The hijackers open
the doors to haul up plastic bags of food and refreshments when the
delivery teams move away.
   The passengers and flight crew, along with their captors, have
eaten little since Friday. They got a hot meal of meat and
vegetables Friday night, but since then have had daily deliveries
of bread, cakes, cheese, soft drinks and mineral water.
   Much of the radio chatter is about technical matters or
housekeeping _ such as requests to empty the toilets _ that seem
trivial as the deadly drama unfolds.
   But the threat of violence is never far away, despite the air of
normality outside as other jets arrive filled with tourists for the
beaches across the bay.
   When a camouflaged C-130 military transport landed Tuesday, one
of the hijackers who was fearful it contained troops to storm the
jet yelled into the radio: ``We see a military plane! Identify it!''
   The controller explained it was a Greek air force plane on a
routine weekly flight supplying Greek officers with the Cyprus
National Guard, and ``nothing to worry about.''
   The hijacker said: ``My men were about to shoot at it.''

<HEAD>Spring Fighting Season Starts Despite Accord on Soviet Withdrawal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Spring thaws have opened the mountain
supply routes of Moslem guerrillas and the seasonal surge of
fighting in Afghanistan has begun despite a U.N.-sponsored accord
on Soviet military withdrawal.
   Leaders of the insurgency, which began after a communist coup in
April 1978, were not parties to the Geneva agreement announced last
week and have said repeatedly they would continue the war.
   Western diplomats said Tuesday there was a sharp increase of
military activity in the past two weeks in eastern Afghanistan near
Pakistan. About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in camps and
cities just inside Pakistan that serve as bases and supply points
for the guerrillas.
   Insurgents overran seven Afghan army posts in Logar province in
the first week of April and, on Monday, a 450-unit Soviet convoy
including more than 100 armored vehicles headed south toward the
province from Kabul, the diplomats reported. They said the level of
fighting appeared normal for early spring.
   Radio Kabul reported that Afghan guerrillas downed a
Soviet-built passenger plane near the Soviet border on Sunday,
killing all 29 people aboard.
   Increased fighting also was reported in Kandahar and Khost.
   The withdrawal agreement is expected to be signed Thursday in
Geneva by the the Afghan government, Pakistan and the United States
and Soviet Union as guarantors. The guerrillas were not invited to
the negotiations and Pakistan acted as their representative.
   In Moscow, an Italian source said Yuli Vorontsov, first deputy
foreign minister, told Italian parliamentarians that 50,000 Soviet
soldiers will be withdrawn in the first three months after May 15.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and
Vorontsov's reported statement was the first indication Kremlin
officials have given of how many were there.
   Under the accord to be signed in Geneva, the Soviets agree to
remove all the troops within nine months of May 15, half of them by
Aug. 15.
   Based on the figure given by Vorontsov, the total Soviet force
in Afghanistan would be about 100,000. Western sources have
estimated it at 115,000.
   Guerrilla leaders have said they would ignore any agreement
reached without their direct participation, and contend that the
only real parties to the Afghan conflict are themselves and the
Soviets.
   They consider the government in Kabul _ now led by Najib _ to be
a Kremlin puppet.
   Diplomatic and other sources reported more fighting in Kandahar,
Afghanistan's second-largest city, and said wounded government and
Soviet soldiers arrived in Kabul last week. All the sources spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Insurgents knocked out a government radio station in the city
March 25 and later did the same to the television station,
diplomats said. They said the radio station had not resumed
broadcasting by the first week of April.
   The sources also reported fighting at Khost, the eastern
garrison town where Soviet-Afghan forces lifted a guerrilla seige
last January after weeks of combat.
   Diplomats reported a rise in convoy activity and air transport
traffic at Kabul airport, which they say reflects a redeployment of
Soviet soldiers and efforts to build up supplies for the Afghan
military before the withdrawal.
   They reported seeing twin-engine Soviet An-72 aircraft, or
possibly An-74s, in Afghanistan for the first time last week. The
short-takeoff-and-landing planes, which have a fast rate of climb,
are less vulnerable than others to U.S. supplied Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles now used by the insurgents.
   According to the diplomats, the aircraft may be there to help
deliver supplies within Afghanistan rather than evacuate Soviet
personnel and equipment.

   Mario Cuomo's promise not to accept a
convention draft will prove most beneficial to Michael Dukakis'
campaign, say prominent Democrats, who believe the New York
governor's vow will finally put an end to speculation over a Cuomo
candidacy.
   ``The last holdouts, the New York City press corps, may now
understand what the rest of the country understands _ the nominee
is in the race,'' Robert Beckel, a political consultant and onetime
adviser to former Vice President Walter Mondale, said Monday.
   Cuomo said this weekend that Democrats should interpret his
earlier statements criticizing any draft efforts to mean he
wouldn't accept a draft for the nomination.
   Dukakis, who is battling Jesse Jackson for front-runner status
and a major share of the 255 delegates at stake in the April 19th
New York primary, is expected to reap the benefits from Cuomo's
statement.
   Nathan Landow, a Maryland developer and major Democratic Party
fund-raiser said Cuomo's decision ``certainly takes some doubt out
of the people's mind who were hoping for an alternative to Dukakis.
I think it will unite the party much faster and bring the focus of
November into a much earlier view.''
   Landow, who is advising Tennesse Sen. Albert Gore Jr., said,
``Gore could benefit from this too. Gore becomes the clear
alternative to Dukakis.''
   The onetime Cuomo supporter said there will be ``a lot of
disappointed Democrats around the country who had a certain glimmer
of hope concerning his candidacy.''
   Former Democratic National Committee chairman John White said he
believed Cuomo from the start when the New York governor said he
was not a candidate, but the statement ``clears the air.''
   White, an adviser to Jackson, said ``whatever plus in (Cuomo's
announcement) has to go to Dukakis.''
   ``Certainly in New York, it helps Dukakis because there was
considerable reluctance for party leaders to get committed. It
frees them and a good many will go to Dukakis,'' he said. ``I think
that's marginal. I don't think it's enough to tip the race one way
or another.''
   One possible delegate, New York City Mayor Edward Koch,
responded to Cuomo's vow with the announcement that he would soon
endorse either Dukakis or Gore. Koch had been preparing to lead a
draft-Cuomo move at the national convention.
   And former New York Rep. Richard Ottinger, a leader of the
draft-Cuomo movement, said he was suspending his effort.
   ``A large number of the uncommitted, a disproportionate share of
those people, felt that Cuomo should run for president,'' said Lee
Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ``A
larger number of those were people who had indicated (in previous
polling) they were supporting Dukakis.''
   The most recent Marist poll said 8 percent of likely New York
Democratic primary voters surveyed said they planned to support a
pro-Cuomo uncommitted slate on the ballot next week.
   While Miringoff said the numbers weren't large, there should be
a shift, in light of Cuomo's latest statements, that would create
``a slight enhancement of the Dukakis advantage'' for the New York
primary.
   The latest Marist poll, conducted last week, had Dukakis the
choice of 47 percent of the Democrats surveyed. Jesse Jackson was
the choice of 31 percent, and Gore 6 percent.
   Cuomo insisted that his ruling out accepting a draft was really
nothing more than what he has been saying for more than a year, but
he said he felt that he had ``to take extra steps to clarify it ...
I'm trying with as much effort as I've ever expended on it to shut
it down, so there's absolutely no question, so it doesn't get
discussed.''
   White said the political necessity that forced Cuomo to make a
clarifying statement reflects the New York governor's strength.
   ``The more he says `no,' the more we seem to court him and want
him,'' White said. ``People are going to go ahead and accept his
statement, but there's going to be a lot of talk ... He's kind of
like the girl who keeps turning you down.''

<HEAD>Thousands Arrive to Mark Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people began arriving this
week for the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto Uprising,
when starving and poorly armed Poles held off the final Nazi
extermination drive for nearly a month.
   About 4,500 guests from throughout the world are expected for
the April 14-19 observances, including the largest Israeli
delegation ever to visit Poland.
   Poland severed diplomatic ties with Israel after the outbreak of
the Middle East War in 1967, when Israel seized the West Bank and
Gaza Strip from Egypt and Jordan. Low-level diplomatic ties resumed
in 1986, with the two countries establishing diplomatic section
offices in each others' capitals.
   The observances climax on April 19 with a ceremony at the Warsaw
Ghetto Fighters' Monument. The monument sits in a plaza in an
apartment complex built on the rubble of the former ghetto, which
was razed by the Nazis.
   Nazis marched into the ghetto early on April 19, 1943, expecting
to organize a rapid deportation and eradication of the last 70,000
inhabitants.
   But they were met with fierce gunfire from the young warriors of
the ghetto's Jewish Defense Organization. The standoff continued
until mid-May, when the Nazis claimed victory and began deporting
the surviving inhabitants to death camps.
   The anniversary events have been jointly organized by Polish and
Israeli committees.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told reporters Tuesday that
Poland will observe the anniversary as an event marking ``tragic
European and Polish events (which) refer to our past, predating the
creation of the state of Israel and the Middle East conflict.''
   He said Poland remains ``in full solidarity with the
Palestinians (in the Israeli-occupied territories) fighting for
their human and national rights.''
   He called Israel's behavior in the territories ``brutal'' and
``an offense to the memory of the defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto
... Contradictory to the ideals'' for which they fought.
   The Israeli visitors include Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon,
a Labor Party member who serves as minister of education and
culture, and Abram Sharir, a Likud member who is minister of
justice and tourism. They are the highest-ranked Israeli officials
ever to visit Poland.
   Although their visits are considered private, ``the whole event
has some influence on Polish-Israeli relations,'' said an Israeli
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In addition to Navon and Sharir, the Israeli delegation includes
six members of parliament and 2,000 Israeli citizens.
   Other notables taking part in the observance are Edgar M.
Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress; the Israeli actor
Topol; author Jerzy Kosinski; and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie
Wiesel, who has written extensively about the Holocaust.
   Poland also expects delegations from the United States, Canada,
Australia and Western Europe.
   Activities planned include an international ``March of the
Living'' on Thursday from the former Nazi concentration camp of
Auschwitz, in southern Poland, to the mass extermination center of
Birkenau nearby.
   A two-day historical and scientific conference on the struggle
of Poles and Jews under the Nazi occupation begins Thursday in
Warsaw.
   On Sunday, Polish television will broadcast an Israeli-organized
quiz program for young people on the history of the Warsaw ghetto.
   About 120 Poles are to be honored as ``Righteous Among Nations''
by the Israeli Yad Vashem Institute for the aid they gave Jews
during World War II.
   On Monday, a newly built monument at Umschlagplatz, where Polish
Jews were loaded onto trains for the trip to the Treblinka death
camp, will be dedicated.
   A group led by the last surviving commander of the uprising,
Marek Edelman, plans to hold its own observances on Sunday.
   The group includes several activists of the outlawed Solidarity
trade union federation and prominent cultural figures.

<HEAD>State Department Official Says He Tried to Warn Bahamas' Prime
Minister</HEAD>

   A State Department official testified
Tuesday in the cocaine trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas that he tried
to alert the Bahamas' prime minister to illegal activity in the
islands, but was only asked the identity of his sources.
   Andrew F. Antippas, former deputy director the U.S. mission in
Nassau, said he was removed from his post in 1983 after
investigating complaints about the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay.
He is now stationed in South Korea.
   Defense attorneys complained that testimony was going far beyond
the original cocaine-smuggling indictment, and said they were
planning to ask for a mistrial.
   ``The errors that have previously been committed will be grossly
compounded,'' said defense attorney Edward R. Shohat, arguing
against allowing Antippas' testimony.
   ``In clear terms, this is a hydra-headed case,'' said Shohat,
who added that much of the testimony in Lehder's trial has been
outside the scope of the indictment, which covers the period of
1978 to 1980.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trial
on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into
the United States from Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   ``This indictment has been stressed and mangled so much that is
unrecognizable,'' said Jose Quinon, another defense attorney.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, the chief prosecutor in the
case, however, argued that Shohat was incorrect.
   ``Mr. Shohat can shout from now to the cows come home ... but it
is not going to make the sun come up in the west,'' said Merkle.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton allowed Antippas to
testify, but limited hearsay testimony.
   Antippas testified he met with Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O.
Pindling in 1981 to discuss written complaints he had received from
Americans living on Norman's Cay.
   ``I raised this with the prime minister and he said he knew of
no such complaints and problems on the island. He asked me who
these people were and I declined to tell him,'' said Antippas.
   He said he also complained to Clement Maynard, home affairs
minister in the Bahamas, and asked that police be stationed on the
island to protect Americans and their property. Maynard agreed.
   In January 1982, Antippas said, he went to the island and found
that police there had no vehicles and were apparently doing nothing.
   He returned in April 1983 and found the island nearly deserted.
He also collected telephone toll records and ledgers from the
island and placed them in the embassy vault in Nassau.
   In December 1982, a new ambassador was appointed for the
Bahamas, Lev Dobriansky, and six months later, Antippas said, the
governor told him to find another job.
   The items he had stored in the vault couldn't be found, he said.
   Gorman Bannister, in earlier testimony, had said his father,
Nassau businessman Everette Bannister, a close associate of
Pindling, had complained that Antippas was a thorn in his side and
vowed to have him removed.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with only being a member
of the smuggling conspiracy.

<HEAD>Patent Office Grants First Animal Patent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new type of laboratory mouse broke legal
ground Tuesday as the federal government granted Harvard University
the first U.S. patent on an animal.
   ``A few minutes ago we issued a patent which, for the first time
in the history of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, covers an
animal,'' Patent Commissioner Donald J. Quigg announced shortly
after noon.
   ``This particular animal (is) a mouse which has been genetically
engineered so as to make it more susceptible to'' cancer, Quigg
said.
   The patent, No. 4,736,866, named Philip Leder of Chestnut Hill,
Mass., and Timothy A. Stewart of San Francisco as inventors of the
mouse, which is to be used for research into cancer.
   Patents on forms of life are not new, with both plants and types
of bacteria having been patented in the past.
   Almost any type of animal _ except humans _ could be considered
for a patent, Quigg said.
   The Patent Office said last year that it was considering patents
on animals, following an appellate court ruling in a case involving
a new type of oyster.
   That ruling said that the agency could go beyond the plants and
bacteria, to which it had previously limited patents on life forms.
The oyster patent was never issued, however, with examiners
concluding that the process was not original enough.
   The only other animal case occurred in 1974, when the Patent
Office refused to patent a dwarf chicken.
   The question of patenting animals has raised some controversy in
recent years, however, with opponents questioning the ethics of
changing animals.
   Bills have been introduced in Congress to place a moratorium on
such patents until the ethical problems can be worked out, and
Quigg said that Congress and the scientific laboratory are the
proper forum for such debates.
   The patent application for the mouse, which had been pending
since June 22, 1984, met the legal requirements for a patent, and
so one was issued, he said.
   There are 21 more animal patent applications pending for the
agency, Quigg added. Federal law requires that the subject of
applications be kept secret until a patent is issued, he said.
   However, Quigg said further animal patents are not expected to
issue for ``some months.''
   According to the mouse patent, a cancer-susceptible gene is
introduced to the mouse embryo when it is first formed, at the
stage of one or two cells.
   The genetic material used to change the mice is spliced together
from an activated version of the mouse cancer gene and a virus that
causes mammary tumors in mice, explained Harvard spokeswoman
Lillian Blacker.
   Having mice that are more sensitive to cancer can be a major
benefit for researchers, Quigg said.
   Currently, mice are often exposed to massive doses of chemicals
to see if cancer results. The altered mice could be exposed to
chemical levels more like those encountered by humans, perhaps
making the experiments more easily related to human dangers, Quigg
said.
   The mice have been used in research since 1984 at Harvard,
Blacker said, with the introduced traits remaining true through
several generations.
   The sensitive mice can be used both to test the causes of cancer
and cancer-fighting agents, Blacker and Quigg both said.
   The Patent Office announcement drew prompt reaction on both
sides of the issue.
   Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends termed the
action an ``arrogant abuse of power'' by the Patent Office. Rifkin,
who has opposed genetic engineering, said a coalition of groups
will seek to get Congress to overturn the action.
   Rifkin also raised the possibility that an engineered mouse
could escape and breed with wild mice, perhaps posing a danger to
the environment.
   But the Industrial Biotechnology Association hailed the action
for providing researchers a new tool for cancer research.
   Legally, a patent holder has the right to exclusive use of an
invention for 17 years. In practice, most patent holders license
their developments to others, collecting a fee. The idea is to
encourage invention by protecting the rights of individuals who
produce something new.

<HEAD>Army Cook Sentenced To Death For Murder And Rape Of Two Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old former Army cook was
sentenced to death Tuesday by a court-martial panel for raping and
murdering two women.
   Ronald A. Gray already had been sentenced to eight life terms in
a separate civilian case after he confessed raping and killing the
two women.
   The six-member court-martial panel returned its unanimous
verdict after about two hours of deliberations. The panel also
reduced Gray from Spec. 4 to private, forfeited all his pay and
ordered him dishonorably discharged from the Army.
   Under the armed forces' Uniform Code of Military Justice, Gray
gets an automatic appeal.
   Gray, a former cook with the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute
Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division, was convicted last
week of 14 counts of rape, robbery, murder and attempted murder.
   Army lawyers said earlier in the week that the Army's prescribed
form of execution now is lethal injection.
   In the civilian case, tried in Cumberland County Superior Court,
he must serve at least 60 years before being eligible for parole.
   In the court-martial, Gray was convicted of raping and killing
Kimberly Anne Ruggles, 24, a civilian cab driver, on Jan. 6, 1987,
and Laura Lee Vickery Clay, an Army private, on Dec. 15, 1986. Both
women were from Fayetteville.
   Ruggles bled to death after being stabbed seven times. Clay was
shot four times with a .22-caliber pistol that Gray confessed to
stealing.
   He also was convicted of raping and attempting to kill Pvt. Mary
Ann Nameth, 20, who was stabbed three times in the neck on Jan. 3,
1987, in a Fort Bragg barracks. She testified against Gray during
the court-martial and identified him as her assailant.

   Robert Kennedy used give-and-take over the
family dinner table to prod his children to excel and he read a
Bible story to them nightly, his daughter Kathleen Townsend recalls
as the 20th anniversary of Kennedy's murder nears.
   Now 36 and practicing environmental law, Mrs. Townsend said in
an interview in the current McCall's magazine that she preferred
not to talk about Kennedy's death on June 6, 1968, while running
for the Democratic nomination for president.
   ``I want to remember the happy times, the vibrancy of his
presence,'' said Mrs. Townsend, who lives in the Baltimore suburb
of Ruxton with her literature-professor husband, David, and three
daughters.
   She said her father's arrival home always touched off tickling
and roughhousing and later everybody in the big family, except for
the very youngest, had dinner together.
   ``Those mealtimes were school away from school, but we loved
them,'' she said. ``My father would toss questions at us about
history. ... If we knew the answers we'd yell them out as though we
were winning a big jackpot in a quiz show. And if we drew blanks,
my father would say quietly, `You can do better than that.' That
made us want to do better.''
   She remembered his telling the children, ``Take the hard course,
not the easy way. Make the tough decisions.''
   She said that around 8:30 p.m. all the children left their
bedrooms at Kennedy's call and sat on the floor at the top of the
stairs.
   ``Before the cross that hung there, my father would read Bible
stories, one each night, from a children's version of the Old
Testament. And we'd sit in total silence, which was unusual for us,
entranced. ...
   ``I never forgot those evenings. Now we read the same Bible
stories every night to our children, who are just as enchanted by
them as we were.''

   Trumpeter Al Hirt is still having problems with
his right hand and arm.
   Hirt, 65, is back in Methodist Hospital, a spokeswoman said

   Even though she says she's tired of being seen
as ``the perfect mom,'' Actress Meredith Baxter Birney has agreed
to play that role for a seventh season in the popular television
program, ``Family Ties.''
   ``But I'm not the perfect person,'' the 40-year-old mother of
five says in an interview in the May issue of McCall's magazine.
``And we're not the perfect family. Our kids squabble just like any
other kids.''
   Ms. Birney, a runner and a vegetarian, says she puts a lot of
effort into how she looks. ``In my business, the way you look is so
bound up with getting work, with staying employed. ... When you're
in front of the public eye, your past rises up to haunt you.
   ``People see reruns of shows I did five years ago, and they say
`Look how young she looks there.' You're in constant competition
with your former self,'' she said.

   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia toured
the construction site for Expo 92, giving a royal boost to the
international exposition's image in Spain four years before the
opening date.
   The royal couple visited the Expo site Tuesday on Cartuja
Island, across the Guadalquivir River from Seville's historic
district, and inaugurated a traveling exhibit and model of the
513-acre grounds.
   ``The Expo is completely irreversible. It will be done and done
well,'' said one top exposition official, who asked not to be
named. ``The king's visit is the definitive show of backing.''
   The official said he wanted to dispel rumors that the exposition
was in trouble following press reports of an internal squabble
between two Expo commission members.
   Expo 92 and Barcelona's 1992 Summer Olympic Games are the
centerpieces of a government plan to spread a message of a modern,
democratic Spain on the 500th anniversary of Columbus' voyage
across the Atlantic.

   Atlanta Braves officials say Carolyn King has
broken two barriers as the team's ballpark organist this year _ she
is the first black organist and the youngest full-time organist in
major league baseball.
   Miss King, an 18-year-old senior at Avondale High School, ``can
play anything,'' said Miles McRea, the Braves' director of
promotions. ``She's just outstanding. Not many people can walk
right up to an organ as complex as the one we have and just start
playing. She did it.''
   During tryouts for the job, Miss King beat out six other
candidates, including Lowery Ballew, the Braves' organist for the
past 10 years.
   She uses no printed music. ``I play by ear,'' she said. ``After
I first hear a song, I normally can learn to play it between five
minutes and three hours. I'd say classical music is one of my
favorites, and so are songs from children's cartoon shows.''
   Miss King also is a member of her high school band, sings and
plays organ at Ebenezer Baptist Church, and teaches music to nine
students.
   ``Even though she's going away to college somewhere this fall,
we can work something out for the future,'' said McRea. ``She's
great.''

<HEAD>Marine Killed On Patrol; 8 U.S. Soldiers Injured In Helicopter
Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Marine sentry was killed on a
security patrol and eight soldiers were injured in the collision of
two U.S. army helicopters in Panama, the U.S. Southern Command said
today.
   The senty was shot and killed Monday night, apparently by fellow
Marines, while investigating a reported intrusion at a petroleum
storage area at Howard Air Force Base, on the outskirts of Panama
City, the command said.
   It also announced that two UH-60 helicopters collided on a
runway at Fort Sherman, about 50 miles north of the capital near
the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal, during a nighttime
exercise.
   Eight soldiers were taken to Gorgas Army Hospital with minor
injuries, the command said, but their names were not immediately
released. They were assigned to the 228th Regiment at Fort Kobee,
another U.S. installation along the canal.
   Air Force Col. Ron Sconyers of the Southern Command said the
dead Marine was a corporal from I Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th
Marine Regiment, based at Camp LeJeune, N.C. His name was not made
public.
   Sconyers said the corporal was part of a 52-man Marine patrol at
the Arriajan tank farm, a fuel storage area near the air base, when
he was shot in the stomach while investigating a reported break-in.
   Attempts to revive him with open heart massage were
unsuccessful, the colonel said, adding that several major arteries
were severed and the Marine suffered massive internal bleeding.
   Sconyers and other spokesmen for the Southern Command said they
had no further information, but in Washington, a Pentagon
spokesman, Dan Howard, said there had been ``an apparant intrusion
by six or eight individuals.''
   Howard said there have been a series of recent intrusions at the
base by individuals wearing camouflage uniforms who he described as
apparent members of the Panamanian Defense Forces, the joint
ground, air and sea unit commanded by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.

<HEAD>Northeastern States Have Most Vital Economies, Research Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northeastern states with high levels of public
spending have the most vital economies while ``low wage, low tax''
states in the South, Plains and Mountain regions have the worst, a
private research organization said Tuesday.
   The Corporation for Enterprise Development, seeking to counter
business climate studies that give high marks to states with the
least government spending, released an economic report card that
listed six states as leaders in the economic competition between
the states. All but one border on or include parts of the
Washington-Boston urban corridor.
   ``The Northeast is where today's economic action is,'' said
Robert Friedman, president of the non-profit research group.
   Getting grades of A or B in each of four areas _ economic
performance, business vitality, economic capacity and policy
strength _ were Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
Vermont and Minnesota.
   Friedman said those states have in common ``a long-standing
commitment to public investments.''
   States should not compete with Third World countries for
industries whose prime concern is cost, Friedman argued. ``In
today's economy, we will compete not just by making more of
something cheaper, but by making it better or differently.''
   New Jersey and Vermont are new on the honor roll, which was
released for the first time last year.
   California and New York, which made it into the top group last
year, slipped. Friedman said that was largely because the 1988
report more heavily weights the gap between rich and poor in those
states.
   The next group of states, which did well overall in the 1988
ranking and which Friedman called ``the contenders,'' were:
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Washington, California, Maine, Delaware
and Virginia.
   States getting mostly Ds and Fs this year were Idaho, Nevada,
South Dakota and the Southern states of Alabama, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
   Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, which had
ranked near the bottom in 1987, moved out of the lowest group of
states.
   The report cautioned that the rankings are relative and that a
state's movement may not be due to any change within the state but
could be caused by improvement or deterioration in other states.
   The economic performance grade includes job growth, pay levels,
the poverty rate, the crime rate, environmental quality and infant
mortality.
   Business vitality refers to the competitiveness and diversity of
current business and a state's ability to spawn new businesses.
   Economic capacity covers a state's financial resources, its
infrastructure such as roads and bridges and the education level of
its workforce.
   Policy strength measures the effectiveness of government
regulation, education spending and support for research.
   The $200,000 study was paid for by grants: 38 percent from
private foundations, 32 percent from businesses and 30 percent from
labor unions, Friedman said.
   Grant Thornton, a Chicago accounting firm which compiles one of
the most well-known business climate indexes, has noted the union
funding and has criticized the Corporation for Enterprise
Development for being too subjective. It says its own rankings,
which assign greater weight to cost factors, reflect the priorities
of manufacturing firms.

<HEAD>35 Jews Seeking to Emigrate Reported Arrested at Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested 35 Jews on Tuesday after a
demonstration in central Moscow in which the asked authorities to
explain why they haven't been allowed to emigrate, a Jewish
activist said.
   Bella Gulko said she and 45 other refuseniks _ those who have
been denied permission to emigrate _ went to the reception office
of the Communist Party Central Committee seeking promised
explanations on why they have been unable to obtain exit visas. No
one would receive them, she said.
   The group of refuseniks had alerted the Central Committee on
Monday of their plan to visit, citing a pledge given them by party
and government officials at a March 1 meeting that they would be
given a reply within 40 days, she said.
   When the refuseniks were denied a meeting with officials, they
went across the street from the Central Committee building and
stood there, some holding placards demanding exit visas, said Ms.
Gulko, 48, who has been seeking for nine years to emigrate.
   Three buses then pulled up to the group, and 35 were arrested,
she said.
   ``The police treated us roughly, ripping up our signs and
pulling us and twisting us by the arms,'' Ms. Gulko said. None of
the demonstrators was injured, she said.
   The Jews were taken to two police stations, where some were held
for more than five hours, she said. A police complaint was filed
against the refuseniks accusing them of holding an illegal
demonstration, she said.
   Two of the protesters were fined the equivalent of $16 by a
Moscow neighborhood court. The others requested legal
representation, and were told they would go on trial later, she
said.
   New regulations that went into effect last year require Soviet
authorities to tell applicants for emigration why their request has
been rejected.
   Jewish activists, however, say the rules are ignored or that
overly general reasons are given that don't tell applicants for an
exit visa exactly why their request has been refused.
   Ms. Gulko formerly was employed as an engineer specializing in
ventilation and air conditioning systems. She said she has never
been given a specific reason for why she has been unable to get an
exit visa.
   She also said she never engaged in secret work for the
government, which Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has said
is the sole legitimate reason that can cause rejection of an
application to leave the Soviet Union.
   Last year, as relations between the Soviet Union and the West
improved, more than 8,000 Soviet Jews were permitted to emigrate,
nearly eight times as many as the year before and the highest total
since 1981.
   Among those who have left in recent months are longtime Jewish
activists and refuseniks Josef Begun, Vladimir Slepak and Ida
Nudel. Jewish activists say thousands, if not tens of thousands, of
Jews want to emigrate but have been turned down.

   Thousands of striking workers closed
down the country's second largest auto plant Tuesday, and
anti-government students battled riot police at six campuses
nationwide.
   About 4,000 workers at Daewoo Motor Co. began a sit-in at their
plant in Pupyong near Seoul. Union leaders are demanding a 26
percent increase in monthly salaries at the company, a joint
venture with the U.S. General Motors Corp.
   Labor leaders at the Pupyong auto plant also said more than
9,000 other workers joined their indefinite strike Tuesday at four
company plants near Seoul and in the southern port city of Pusan.
   About 1,000 students from 10 schools battled riot police at
Seoul National University after vowing to lead a unified
anti-government movement before National Assembly elections on
April 26. Police fired barrages of tear gas at about 600 students
shouting ``overthrow the dictatorship together with workers.''
   A policeman was seriously injured in clashes with hundreds of
students at a seminary near Pupyong after a campus rally supporting
labor rights, the Yonhap news agency reported.
   Labor disputes, mostly peaceful, have escalated in recent weeks.
Government officials say workers in several major industries are
now braced for new strikes.
   Union leaders have urged workers to shun violence and political
demands.
   However, near downtown Seoul Tuesday, riot police carried off
400 workers from Daewoo Precision Industries Ltd. who tried to
march into headquarters of the Daewoo conglomerate.
   No injuries were reported.
   Violent protests battered many Korean companies last summer
after student-led demonstrations prompted the government to promise
major reforms, including December's presidential election. Roh
Tae-woo won the election over a divided opposition, and government
opponents have been escalating their campaign to topple him.
   The dispute at Daewoo has delayed delivery of cars for export,
mostly to the United States.
   Workers also continued their two-day-old strike Tuesday at
Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery Ltd., the nation's
second-largest shipyard, on southern Koje island.

<TEXT>
   The government will pay $177 million to
borrow and exhibit more than 700 Swiss-owned paintings in its
capital for 10 years, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The report in Spain's leading daily El Pais came less than a
week after Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, whose trust owns
the paintings, signed a loan agreement with Culture Minister Javier
Solana.
   The government and press have hailed the accord as a coup that
cements Spain's reputation as an international art center. The
paintings come from a 1,600-painting collection owned by Tyssen's
trust and valued at $2 billion.
   The loaned paintings have not been announced, but they are
expected to include some by great artists in the 13th to 20th
century collection.
   The Duke of Badajoz, King Juan Carlos' brother-in-law, served as
intermediary in the accord and said earlier it could pave the way
to make Spain the collection's permanent home.
   Under the agreement, Spain will pay $44 million to set up a
national trust, which will in turn pay Thyssen $4.4 million a year
in rent.
   The newspaper, citing unnamed Culture Ministry officials, said
the government would also pay to refurbish and maintain
Villahermosa Palace, a 19th-century building that will house the
paintings. The palace faces the famous Prado Museum.

<TEXT>
   City planners thought they had the
perfect solution when a developer sought to build homes next to a
marsh where endangered species of mice and birds live: Ban all cats
from the homes.
   But that was before the cat lovers began phoning, and one city
council member says he'll bring up the issue at next Monday's
council meeting.
   ``It's unconstitutional,'' said City Councilman Gary Frugoli.
``We'll be the laughingstock of everybody.''
   ``It's ridiculous that the city's trying to restrict people from
having animals ...,'' he said. ``How do we enforce it? Are we going
to have police officers out there checking to see if they have
cats?''
   But it's not so ridiculous, countered City Planning Director
Anne Moore, who said the city imposed the ban at the suggestion of
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The homes are to be built near swampy grasslands by Gallinas
Creek in this suburb about 20 miles north of San Francisco. The
swampland is home to the salt marsh harvest mouse and the clapper
rail bird, both of which are on state and federal endangered
species lists.
   Permits for the 224-home development were issued March 29 after
the city Planning Commission approved construction on condition
that felines be banned.
   ``There's definitely a logic to this,'' Ms. Moore said. ``This
is the mouse that has stopped development all over San Francisco
Bay when it is found in an area where development is proposed.''
   Ray Royce, chief of subdivisions in the California Real Estate
Department, said the cat ban could be the first in the nation to
affect private homes.
   ``I don't know of a similar proposal,'' he said.
   The developer, Southwest Diversified, had no problems with the
ban.
   It's a ``reasonable compromise'' between the environment and the
need for housing, said Richard Garlinghouse, senior vice president
of Southwest Diversified. ``Twenty years ago we would have simply
gone in and bulldozed.''
   The executive said he has agreed that a section of land that
lies between the housing project and the marsh will remain wild, as
sort of a buffer zone.
   Ms. Moore, who acknowledges getting some irate phone calls from
cat lovers, praised the developer for ``being very sensitive to the
environmental situation. It was not an issue with the developer.
They said `fine.'''
   Gail Kobetich, field supervisor of the federal wildlife
service's Sacramento endangered species office, said that cats
``are one of our major concerns. They're predators.''
   Negotiations aimed at saving the endangered mouse are going on
over several planned developments on the east and south sides of
San Francisco Bay, said Kobetich.
   ``We generally arrive at a reasonable solution,'' he said.

   A Marine guarding a petroleum storage area
near a U.S. military base in Panama was shot and killed, apparently
by fellow Marines, while investigating an alleged intrusion by
Panamanian forces into the area, a Pentagon official said today.
   ``This petroleum tank farm has been the site of a series of
intrusions in the recent past, which resulted in increased
vigilance and patrol,'' said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   The purpose of the intrusions and the exact identity of the
intruders were not clear, he said.
   The facility stores fuel for U.S. airplanes and vehicles at
nearby Howard Air Force Base, he said.
   ``When one has intruders into the base perimeter, who are in
uniform and are camouflaged, the assumption that one comes to is
that, of course, they are PDF,'' or members of the Panamanian
Defense Force, said Howard.
   No intruders were apprehended. ``In the confusion of the firing,
the intruders all escaped,'' said U.S. Air Force Col. Ron Sconyers,
a spokesman at U.S. Southern Command.
   The Marine was identified as Cpl. Ricardo M. Villahermosa, 25,
of Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was part of I Company, 3rd Battalion,
4th Marine Regiment, part of the 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigade
and was sent from Camp LeJeune, N.C., to Panama as part of a
strengthened security force last week, officials said.
   Villahermosa was struck by at least one shot in the abdomen, and
was pronounced dead at Gorgas Hospital in Panama.
   Attempts to revive the Marine with open-heart massage were
unsuccessful. Several major arteries were hit by the bullet and the
Marine suffered massive internal bleeding, Sconyers said.
   Describing the incident as a ``tragic accident,'' Howard told
reporters at the Pentagon that it ``occurred after an apparent
intrusion by six or eight individuals into the tank farm area.''
   ``U.S. security forces patrolling the area split up and were in
the process of rejoining when a trip flare was set off, sounding
like gunfire,'' he said.
   ``In response, two elements of the patrol fired. Seven rounds
were discharged before the on-the-scene commander ordered a
ceasefire. Initial indications are that the fatal gunshot wound was
not the result of hostile gunfire, but rather the result of a
crossfire from the U.S. shots fired,'' he said.
   ``Details of the incident are sketchy at this time,'' he said,
and the matter is under investigation.
   In another accident, two U.S. Army UH-60A Blackhawk helicopters
carrying a total of eight soldiers collided during a night training
exercise at an airstrip at Fort Sherman in Panama, Howard said.
   ``The soldiers were conducting routine training involving
familiarization with night-vision devices immediately prior to the
crash,'' at about 10:45 p.m. EDT Monday night, said the spokesman.
   The soldiers, assigned to the First Battalion, 228 Aviation
Regiment, in Panama, were treated for minor injuries, he said.
   The accident came just over a month after two UH-60 helicopters
collided during a night training mission and crashed 250 feet to
the ground, killing 17 servicemen near Fort Campbell Army Air Field
in Kentucky.
   The Blackhawk is one of the Army's newest helicopters, but has
been grounded several times. Last summer, officials said that about
40 people had been killed in crashes of the helicopter since 1978.

   Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore Jr. traded barbs in a New York
debate Tuesday on the Middle East, welfare cuts and timidity in
dealing with fellow Democrat Jesse Jackson. Republican George Bush
said he ``can't wait to take on'' one of them in the fall campaign.
   A week before the pivotal New York primary, the Democratic
battle was turning into ``a bloodletting,'' Bush said, as he moved
sedately toward the GOP nomination that is all but his.
   ``We're warming up for the fall race,'' the vice president said
before tossing out the first ball for a New York Mets-Montreal
Expos game at Shea Stadium.
   ``I still intend to campaign right through the end of the
primary season,'' Bush said in Schenectady. ``I can't wait to take
on whichever one of those three Democrats wins the Democratic
nomination.''
   The balloting in New York next Tuesday is a foregone conclusion
for the Republicans. But for the Democrats, the primary offers rich
prizes and harsh judgments.
   For Jackson, it offers another chance to prove he can attract
white votes and continue the growth of a mainstream campaign.
   ``I was an underdog for 45 years and 11 months, and now I'm one
of the top dogs, and I just love it,'' Jackson said in the New York
Daily News debate. ``New York loves a winner, and I'm a winner. ...
Vote for a winner. Vote for Jackson action.''
   Dukakis, the front-runner in the polls, is hoping to make it
three primary victories in a row and stretch out his delegate lead
with the lion's share of the 255 New York delegates at stake.
   On Tuesday in the AP delegate count, Dukakis has 750.15 votes;
Jackson, 713.1; Gore, 396.8 and uncommitted, 506.7.
   In search of the 2,082 votes needed to win the nomination at the
Democratic National Convention in July, Dukakis said he was seeking
delegates who supported candidates who have dropped out and even
``maybe for Al Gore's delegates.''
   ``Don't lick your chops too soon, Gov. Dukakis,'' Gore fired
back in the debate. ``New York's going to have a bigger say about
that than you will.''
   Gore, trailing badly in the polls, must do well in the April 19
primary just to keep his campaign alive.
   As he has in past debates, the Tennessee senator landed the
first punches in the confrontation, one of several scheduled before
Tuesday's balloting.
   Hitting on the Middle East _ a key issue in New York _ Gore said
Dukakis had sounded a note of ``enthusiasm'' about an independent
Palestinian state and he said he disagreed ``with the way Jesse
Jackson advocates a Palestinian state.''
   ``That's not a personal attack,'' Gore concluded.
   Dukakis retorted that Gore was just wrong. ``I didn't express
enthusiasm for a Palestinian state yesterday,'' he said.
   For his part, Jackson did not back down from his support for a
Palestinian homeland: ``While we can guarantee secure borders, we
cannot insure tranquility so long as there is occupation.''
   Then the Massachusetts governor brought up Gore's attacks on him
a week ago.
   ``I think we can disagree without suggesting anyone is attacking
anyone,'' Dukakis said. ``And Al, I think I heard you correctly
when you were attacking me for not attacking Jesse. That's the
first time that's happened in 25 years.''
   With Jackson watching the exchange, Gore retorted: ``What I said
was you were timid in not being willing to say why you believed you
would make a better president than Jesse Jackson.''
   Dukakis would not let Gore have the last word: ``No, you said I
was timid because I would not attack this man. First time that's
happened.''
   Earlier this month, Gore attacked Dukakis for being ``absolutely
timid'' in his comments about Jackson and said Dukakis was ``afraid
to say a single word about Jesse Jackson.''
   On welfare, Gore said Dukakis recently recommended ``very, very
deep cuts'' in aid to welfare recipients in Massachusetts. ``You're
wrong. You're wrong,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor proposed a 5.5 percent increase in
state spending next year for Aid to Families with Dependent
Children, only enough to keep up with inflation.
   Without a serious opponent for the GOP nomination, Bush
campaigned across New York, saying he was ``running against the
ghost of Jimmy Carter'' and saying there is little difference
between the 1988 Democratic contenders.
   ``Do you want Americans to go back to those terrible days of
malaise and darkness?'' he asked in a speech at a Syracuse shopping
mall.
   ``That's exactly what we'd have if we ended up electing one of
them,'' Bush told reporters.
   Pressed by reporters as to why he was attacking Carter _ who has
been out of office for more than seven years _ Bush replied:
   ``Because the policies of the Democrats will take us right back
to the high interest rates and the double-digit inflation of the
Carter years.''
   Bush also made a pitch for black voters, saying the GOP offers
``more hope than some of those age-old Democratic answers that have
failed. A lot of blacks have voted the straight lever, voted
automatically for Democrats and what's it gotten them? Taken for
granted over and over again.''

<HEAD>U.S. Calls for Multinational Effort To Resettle Afghan Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRYGOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration urged the United
Nations on Tuesday to organize a multinational drive to help
millions of Afghan refugees ``return in safety and honor'' when
Soviet troops withdraw.
   The United States is prepared to aid the effort, but ``the
United Nations and its specialized agencies are the logical
organizations to coordinate the job,'' State Department spokesman
Charles E. Redman said.
   More than 5 million Afghans have fled to neighboring countries,
mostly Pakistan, during the eight-year war that has pitted the
Afghan government and Soviet troops against U.S.-backed guerrilla
forces.
   Now that Soviet forces are to leave the country by early next
year, under an agreement to be signed in Geneva on Thursday, the
return of the displaced Afghan population is emerging as one of the
next difficult regional issues to be settled.
   Adding to the difficulty is the likelihood of continued fighting
after the departure of Soviet troops, because both superpowers have
reserved the right to keep aiding the warring factions.
   Redman, referring to further settlement talks led by United
Nations mediator Diego Cordovez, said ``a constructive effort is
taking place to work out an interim government and to help the
refugees return in safety and honor.''
   He said there was no timetable for the return of the refugees
and added:
   ``This process has to be done in such a way that it's done
securely, that these people are taken care of. There is obviously
going to be some social disorganization inside Afghanistan as this
proceeds. We need to try to do this in a coordinated way.''
   Pakistan, though which much of the U.S. aid to the Afghan
resistance has been funneled, is especially eager for the return of
the refugees from border regions that have been made unstable by
the war.
   State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they hoped for the earliest possible return of the refugees
but were concerned about the impact further fighting in the country
would have on resettlement.
   They also said the withdrawal of Soviet forces from the country
could touch off a massive desire among the refugees to trek home.
   ``The likelihood of continued violence does not frighten the
Afghan people,'' one official said. ``What made them flee in the
first place was not violence, it was the magnitude of the violence,
namely attacks from the Soviet air force, napalm attacks,
helicopter raids on villages.''
   ``When that ends they will want to return,'' the official said.
   Under the Afghan accords, the Soviets will withdraw their troops
by Feb. 15, 1989, the refugees will return, and Afghanistan will
become an independent, non-aligned nation.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed between
themselves, nevertheless, to continue aiding their clients in the
country.
   Redman said that agreement has been clarified in private
communications between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and will be
reinforced in statements by the two when they attend the signing
ceremony in Geneva.
   Some U.S. conservatives, led by Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H.,
have said they are concerned nonetheless that U.S. acceptance of
the Afghan accord is a signal of flagging Reagan administration
support for the resistance forces.
   A group of conservatives met the president Tuesday to express
those concerns.
   ``We think the administration is well intentioned, but we
question the results,'' Paul Weyrich, president of the Free
Congress Foundation, told reporters after the meeting.
   Weyrich said the conservatives told Reagan that Pakistan ``is
going to have a very difficult time'' helping supply any new aid,
because the accord calls for non-interference by Pakistan, as well
as the Soviet Union.
   Reagan reminded the group that he had received personal
assurances from Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq ``of their
willingness to take the heat and the willingness to continue
supplying'' the resistance forces, Weyrich said.
   ``The president told us repeatedly and in very definitive terms
that he is going to stand by the Afghan freedom fighters no matter
what,'' Weyrich said.

   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd
announced today he will not run for the leadership post next year
and will, instead, seek the chairmanship of the Senate
Appropriations Committee if he is re-elected to a sixth term and
the Democrats retain control of the Senate.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., announced his intentions at a private meeting of
Senate Democrats and in a two-way satellite hook-up between
Washington and West Virginia State College in Institute.
   The decision of Byrd, who has been either the Senate's majority
or minority leader for the last 12 years, opens up a race for the
Senate's most powerful and influential post among the Senate's 54
Democrats, assuming Senate control remains in their hands.
   Byrd said that as appropriations committee chairman, he would
have an opportunity to help his state, which he said has suffered
under the Reagan administration's economic policies.
   ``Now, for the first time, I have a new opportunity to have a
more direct influence on the allocation of our nation's scarce
fiscal resources,'' Byrd said.
   ``At this point in time, I believe I can best serve the people
of my state by becoming chairman of the appropriations committee,''
he said.
   Since the Democrats reclaimed control of the Senate in 1986 and
Byrd reclaimed the title of majority leader, it had been rumored
that he would step down at the end of this term.
   He said earlier that the appropriations chairmanship would put
him ``in a better position to constantly see something that might
be put into West Virginia and to influence it going there.''
   Several political leaders in West Virginia had urged Byrd this
week to choose the powerful appropriations chairmanship, saying he
could do more for the state there than he could as majority leader.
   Three senators who are the leaders in the race to succeed Byrd _
Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and
George Mitchell of Maine _ all confirmed that they are actively
campaigning for the job, and several members said there was no
clear front-runner.
   ``This is Senator Byrd's day,'' said Mitchell. ``The emphasis
ought to be on his contribution.''
   Asked whether he was seeking the top job, Inouye said, ``Yes, I
will.'' As to whether he had the votes to win, the senator said:
``They look good.''
   Inouye said he did not believe any residual criticism of his
performance as chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra investigating
panel last summer would be a problem to his bid.
   Johnston said Byrd had announced his retirement from the
majority leader post in ``a very eloquent statement'' which
received sustained applause from party members.
   Asked whether he believed he had the votes, Johnston said: ``I
hope to have them. I do not now. No one does. I just became a
candidate.''
   One who had been thought a possible candidate, Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., said he would not make the race. ``I'm one of 54
who's not running,'' he said.
   Senate Democrats will elect their leader late this year,
following the November elections that will determine whether they
retain control of the Senate.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said Byrd's retirement as
Democratic leader ``portends a new era.''
   Lautenberg called Byrd, who has been known for his mastery of
Senate rules but somewhat dry leadership style, ``a very effective
leader'' but said he did not necessarily think a successor will
follow in the same vein.
   ``What we'll be looking for in the leader is perhaps someone
with less knowledge of the process, but hopefully able to do it
differently ... the time for change I think is appropriate.''
   Lautenberg said he did not believe seniority would be the key
factor in the leadership race.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said ``I have all the respect
for Senator Byrd over the period of time he has served as majority
leader and minority leader. He made this judgment for the best
interests of the nation and the Senate.''
   Byrd will be 71 on Nov. 20. He came to the Senate 30 years ago
and cultivated a reputation as a master at the legislative game, a
courtly strategist who gained power by attending to his colleagues'
smallest wishes.
   In 1971, Byrd called in his favors and orchestrated a major coup
by ousting Kennedy for the No. 2 party post of assistant leader, or
majority whip. He was a loyal aide to Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, and was easily elected to succeed him in 1976.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III neglected to
tell an FBI agent investigating the Wedtech scandal of discussions
about filling a key Justice Department post with Meese's longtime
friend, Wedtech consultant E. Robert Wallach, the attorney
general's lawyer said Tuesday.
   Meese was interviewed in the Wedtech probe by the FBI on April
17, 1987, just over a week after being informed that Wallach was
under criminal investigation in the matter. A week or so before
being notified of Wallach's status, Meese had asked Wallach whether
he was interested in becoming counselor to Meese at the Justice
Department.
   Meese lawyer James Rocap said that an FBI agent on April 17
asked Meese a question that ``was broad enough to elicit the
counselor job.'' But Meese at the time was ``focusing on an earlier
period'' and perceived the question to relate to whether Wallach
considered taking a job during Meese's early tenure as attorney
general in 1985.
   Meese thought about the FBI interview over the weekend and the
following week, on his own initiative, informed the agent of the
counselor job discussions.
   ``He didn't make a conscious decision during the FBI interview
to withhold the information,'' said Rocap. When he talked to the
agent a second time, Meese also informed the FBI that he and
Wallach had discussed possibly creating an advisory commission in
1986 on which Wallach would serve to examine the administration of
the Justice Department and to suggest possible changes. The
commission was never formed.
   Meese wanted Wallach to join the Justice Department last spring,
despite the growing Wedtech scandal that eventually led to
Wallach's indictment on racketeering charges.
   The attorney general knew at the time that Wallach was a witness
in the Wedtech case, said Rocap.
   But it wasn't until April 8, 1987 that the attorney general was
notified formally under an administrative mechanism involving the
FBI that Wallach was a subject of the criminal investigation into
Wedtech Corp. by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in Manhattan. The
FBI interview of Meese was part of Giuliani's probe. Wallach was
indicted on racketeering charges in the Wedtech scandal last
December. He has pleaded innocent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Land Management said Tuesday it
is going to decide whether recent allegations of cruelty to animals
should mean an end to its practice of giving away large numbers of
wild horses.
   ``We're putting the large-scale adoptions under an intensive
review,'' BLM spokesman Tim Locke said. But he declined to confirm
a report that the no-fee, large-herd ``adoption'' program had been
suspended.
   Since the mid-1970s, the bureau has offered for ``adoption'' the
wild horses taken in its roundups from the Western range on payment
of $125.
   Use of the term ``adoption'' is really a marketing tool, since
after a year the bureau gives the ``foster parent'' title to the
horse.
   Since 1984 the bureau has waived the fee for people willing to
take 100 animals or more.
   Locke said the review was prompted by recent allegations of
abuse, including one at Sheyenne, N.D., where earlier this month
bureau officials reclaimed what was left of a herd of 400 horses on
a ranch there.
   Forty-two horses were missing and 87 had died, mostly of
dehydration or starvation.
   The Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald last week quoted John Boyles, head
of the bureau's wild horse and burro division, as saying, ``We're
not approving any more than those already approved.''
   Both Boyles and Robert Burford, director of the bureau, were
traveling Tuesday and unavailable for comment. Locke would say
only, ``The instruction memo has not been issued. Large-scale
adoptions are still in our regs.''
   Locke said Burford would take up the question when he returns.
   Last year the bureau transferred 8,600 horses to private
caretakers in large-herd, no-fee adoptions. These are generally
horses that no one has taken in individual adoptions, and
frequently undesirable because older horses are more difficult to
break.
   About 5,000 horses a year are adopted by individuals.
   The bureau has to round up horses to keep them from eating so
much forage that cattle cannot graze on the range. It previously
killed the surplus animals, but it abandoned that practice in 1982
following protests by animal rights groups.

   Former Democratic presidential nominee George
McGovern told Jewish voters in New York on Tuesday that Jesse
Jackson is neither anti-Semitic nor anti-Israel and should not be
judged ``on the indiscretions of an earlier time.''
   ``It is not worthy of the great traditions of Judaism for its
adherents to been seen as unforgiving toward a black man who is
extending the hand of reconciliation and peace,'' McGovern said in
a statement.
   As the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee called for
peace-making, however, leaders of two major Jewish groups slammed
Jackson's campaign manager for saying they wanted to meet with
Jackson simply to harass him.
   The statement by Jackson aide Gerald Austin is ``false,
unfortunate and offensive,'' said Malcolm Hoenlein, executive
director of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations.
   ``In view of his theme of healing, we are dismayed that the
Jackson campaign seems to have made a decision not to meet with the
leadership of the New York Jewish community,'' said Lester Pollack,
president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York,
even as the invitation to speak was issued again.
   Jackson alone among the three remaining major Democratic
candidates has not accepted the invitation of the two groups to
speak before the April 19 New York primary. Jewish voters usually
account for up to one-quarter of the Democratic primary voters in
the state.
   The conference of presidents is made up of 44 national Jewish
groups. The council is a coordinating body for 59 Jewish
organizations in the New York metropolitan area.
   McGovern sought to reduce some of the tensions by writing what
he called an ``open letter to the Jewish voters of New York.'' He
said he is not endorsing Jackson.
   ``I have no doubt that Jesse Jackson is free of anti-Semitism _
a bigotry totally at odds with his years of passionate devotion to
civil rights,'' McGovern wrote. ``I do not want to see this
steadily improving political leader judged on the indiscretions of
an earlier time rather than the more mature conduct he demonstrates
today.''
   Three items in particular were addressed by McGovern: Jackson's
``views on the Middle East, his earlier association with the
intemperate Louis Farrakhan and a slurring reference to New York
City as `Hymietown.'''
   ``I fully understand the concerns of Jews on these matters.
Indeed, four years ago, I took public issue with Jesse because of
this,'' McGovern said.
   During his 1984 campaign, Jackson referred to New York as
`Hymietown'' and Jews as ``Hymie'' in what he thought was a private
conversation.
   ``With reference to the `Hymietown' slur, Jackson has long ago
expressed his regrets over this unfortunate language,'' McGovern
wrote. ``He also clearly ended his association with Farrakhan some
years ago.''
   Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, referred to
Judaism as a ``gutter religion'' in 1984, when he was a Jackson
backer.
   On the Middle East, McGovern said that Jackson's positions are
not extreme, that he can be ``a reconciling force in that
hate-ridden region.''
   ``If I were a Jew with special concerns for Israel, I would not
be disturbed by Jesse Jackson's positions,'' McGovern said.
   The 1972 nominee said that Jackson's convictions are ``close to
those'' of some Israeli leaders. He named Abba Eban, Eser Weisman
and Shimon Peres.
   ``It is true that Jackson has met with PLO Leader Yasser Arafat,
favors direct negotiations between Palestinians and the Israelis,
supports the concept of self-determination for Palestinians and the
exchange of Israeli-occupied territory for peace,'' McGovern said.
``These position, with which I agree, do not threaten Israel. Quite
the contrary, they are essential conditions of justice and a secure
peace for Israelis as well as Palestinians.''

<HEAD>Jim Brady, Wife Describe Plight Of Head Injury Victims</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential press secretary James Brady and
his wife Sarah asked Congress on Tuesday to expand home health care
and other services vital to head injury victims, describing vividly
their own plight since Brady was shot.
   ``My name is Jim Brady. I am a seven-year survivor of a
traumatic brain injury,'' Brady said evenly as a hush fell over the
packed Senate hearing room. ``I know only too well the tragedy
surrounding a head injury. I am pleased that you are taking a keen
look at our problems.''
   Brady was shot during the 1981 assassination attempt on
President Reagan and at one point was reported dead. He delivered
his brief statement to the Senate Labor and Human Resources
subcommittee on the handicapped from a wheelchair, with little
expression in his face or voice.
   Though clearly not fully recovered, Brady demonstrated during
his wife's testimony that his famous sense of humor survives in
some form.
   ``Speaking as a family member, I can tell you that going through
that initial trauma is surely difficult, but somehow you do,'' Mrs.
Brady said.
   ``It was difficult for me, too,'' Brady interjected dryly,
winning a roar of laughter from the audience, which included many
head trauma victims.
   Mrs. Brady said Brady had received first-rate care, even down to
a 24-hour Secret Service guard by his hospital room door. ``That
was so I couldn't sneak out,'' Brady interrupted.
   The rude shock came when Brady was released from the hospital
and there was no support network, his wife said. She said she felt
trepidation about facing the situation alone and had no one with
whom to discuss the best way to handle Brady's rehabilitation.
   Under questioning, Mrs. Brady said her family's No. 1 need is
for home care for her husband, who cannot be left alone during a
short shopping trip much less the many hours of a full-time workday.
   ``Jim for example is not able to get out of a chair by himself,
and would not be able to leave our home in the event of a fire,''
she said. ``It's very frustrating to see that home health care is
not always covered'' by government or private insurance.
   Mrs. Brady said families and survivors also need support and
counseling programs to cope with the tragedy that has shattered so
many lives _ children, parents, spouses and the victims themselves.
   She said the shooting has had a devastating impact on Brady's
elderly mother and his 9-year-old son. As for Brady himself, she
said, ``He laughs and keeps a sense of humor up, but I know that he
thinks daily of what he could have been doing.''

<HEAD>Christian Democrat to Form Italy's 48th Postwar Cabinet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier-designate Ciriaco De Mita received final
approval from coalition members Tuesday to form Italy's 48th
post-World War II government and said he would present his Cabinet
list to the president.
   The Christian Democrat leader told reporters, ``All the problems
are resolved'' in negotiations to form another five-party
government.
   De Mita, 60, indicated he would go to the Quirinal Palace on
Wednesday to present his list of Cabinet ministers to President
Francesco Cossiga, thus formally ending the monthlong government
crisis.
   The coalition is to be made up of the same parties that have
governed off and on since 1981: the Christian Democrats,
Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals.
   Leaders of the parties gave their final endorsement of De Mita's
plan on Tuesday.
   Crucial support came from the Socialists, the second-largest
party in the coalition and a frequent critic of the dominant
Christian Democrats.
   Giovanni Di Michelis, a Socialist representative, said the party
will participate in a ``loyal and constructive way.''
   But the top Socialist leader, former Premier Bettino Craxi,
predicted rough going for the new government.
   He was asked if De Mita's government could last through the end
of the legislative term in 1992 and replied, ``It would be a
miracle.''
   Craxi said the new coalition was based on the same foundation as
that led by Premier Giovanni Goria, a Christian Democrat who
resigned on March 11 after eight turbulent months in office.
   Goria said he would not join the new government as a minister.
   Christian Democrat Giulio Andreotti is expected to remain as
foreign minister and Liberal Valerio Zanone as defense minister.
   After presenting his Cabinet list to Cossiga, De Mita will seek
a confidence vote in Parliament where the coalition holds a
comfortable majority in both houses. The vote is expected next week.
   De Mita cleared the final hurdle when the parties agreed on
proposed anti-trust legislation for the Italian media. Under the
accord, no individual or group can own or control both a newspaper
and a television network.
   If the legislation is passed, private television magnate Silvio
Berlusconi will have to give up his Milan newspaper Il Giornale,
while the Fiat automaking company will have to drop plans to expand
into television.
   Fiat owns the newspaper La Stampa of Turin and controls the
Rizzoli publishing group that includes the Corriere Della Sera
newspaper of Milan and the sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport.
   The Socialists had sought to gain equal management control of
the state-run RAI television network, headed by a Christian
Democrat, but that was rejected by De Mita.
   On the issue of nuclear power, the parties put off a final
decision on the fate of the unfinished nuclear plant at Montalto di
Castro near Rome. The Socialists had insisted the plant be
converted to another form of energy production. The Christian
Democrats favor completing the nuclear station.

   Viewers tuning in to watch Cher and her
eye-popping dress helped the Academy Awards show reverse a ratings
decline and rack up its biggest television audience in four years.
   Fans who stuck out the full three hour, 33-minute telecast
Monday night also saw ``The Last Emperor,'' filmed amid the
imperial splendor of Beijing's Forbidden City, sweep all nine
awards for which it was nominated.
   During prime time, from 9-11 p.m. EDT when the networks are
competing against each other, the 60th annual Academy Awards show
on ABC had a rating of 30.1 and a 47 share. Last year, the show
rated 27.5 and a 43 share. The rating is a percentage of the
nation's 88.6 million homes with television. The share is a
percentage of sets in use.
   It was the highest-rated Oscars since 1984, when the live
Hollywood extravaganza had a rating of 30.3 and a 50 share.
   ABC estimated that 80 million viewers saw all or part of this
year's show.
   ``I'm staggered. I don't know what to say about it,'' Producer
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. said Tuesday of the ratings.
   Goldwyn said despite the ratings success, he is bowing out after
two years as the Oscar show producer.
   ``There are a lot more people in this town more talented than I
who should try,'' he said. ``I wish the next guy luck.''
   Cher's sheer, sequined Bob Mackie-designed dress left little to
the imagination when she won the best actress Oscar for
``Moonstruck.'' Another best-actress nominee, Sally Kirkland,
showed up in a black gown with a deep plunging neckline.
   The other acting winners were Michael Douglas, best actor for
``Wall Street''; Sean Connery, best supporting actor for ``The
Untouchables''; and Olympia Dukakis, best supporting actress for
``Moonstruck.''
   ``The Last Emperor,'' writer-director Bernardo Bertolucci's
story of China's boy ruler, won best picture, best director and
best adapted screenplay for the Italian director and collaborator
Mark Peploe.
   Goldwyn said Tuesday he arranged the show's sequences on a hunch
``The Last Emperor'' might sweep the awards.
   ``I knew the big thing was to program against it (the sweep) by
giving entertainment for people while watching a rout,'' he said.
``When I saw it get the editing award, I knew that was it.''
   Oscar gold may translate into box-office silver for ``The Last
Emperor.'' Ticket sales increased last weekend by 49 percent and
Columbia Pictures added 74 screens to the movie's distribution,
apparently in anticipation of Oscar victories.
   The movie so far has earned only $25.1 million in U.S. box
office, compared with ``Three Men and A Baby,'' which has earned
$156.7 million.
   The Oscar show, directed by Marty Passetta, came in the second
month of a strike by the 9,000 members of the Writers Guild of
America. A writing team led by ex-WGA president Mel Shavelson
stopped work on the script and never returned to it after the
strike began March 7.
   The relocation of the Oscars to the cavernous Shrine Auditorium
caused logistical problems, including a monumental traffic jam that
forced some stars to leave their limousines and walk rather than
miss the show.
   Best actress nominees Meryl Streep and Glenn Close, who is nine
months pregnant, were spotted hiking up Jefferson Boulevard in
their Oscar finery.
   It was the first Oscar show at the Shrine in 40 years. The site
was chosen because of its 6,300-seat auditorium, nearly double the
number available in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion where the show
has been staged for the past several years.
   Goldwyn said the bigger audience helped the ambiance of the
awards.
   ``The audience was very warm. The standing ovations were a
knockout. We didn't expect that. The audience was much looser than
at the Dorothy Chandler.''
   The academy confirmed Tuesday that another name should be added
to the list of Oscar winners.
   Set directors Bruno Cesari and Osvaldo Desideri shared as
co-winners in set direction for ``The Last Emperor,'' said academy
spokeswoman Marci Blaze. Desideri's name was inadvertently omitted
from the original list of nominees.

   Stock prices rose again Tuesday as a late
splurge of buying pushed the market to its highest point since the
October crash.
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.09 points to close at
2,110.08, its first close above that level since the market
collapsed on Oct. 19. The gain was the sixth consecutive rise for a
total rise of nearly 130 points.
   Early in the session stock prices were mixed and the market
appeared to lack direction.
   But computer-guided ``program trading'' late in the day set off
a surge of stock buying that pushed up the market. Such programs
seek to profit from price disparities between stock index futures
and the stocks mirrored by the indexes.
   Trading volume remained light, which accentuated the move upward
once buyers did step in, analysts noted.
   Analysts said many investors were sitting on the sidelines
awaiting fresh economic data, such as the government's report on
the U.S. trade deficit for February, which is due Thursday.
   ``A lot of people are going to play it close to the vest until
they see some direction from the numbers coming out,'' said Peter
Vandenberg, a vice president at Smith Barney, Harris, Upham & Co.

   Blacks and whites joined in
paying tribute to Alan Paton, the country's most renowned author
and an outspoken advocate of racial justice who died Tuesday at the
age of 85.
   Paton, whose novel ``Cry, The Beloved Country'' became one of
the world's best-known depictions of apartheid, died of throat
cancer at his estate outside the port city of Durban a day after he
was released from a hospital to spend his last hours at home.
   ``He went peacefully, happy to have been in his own bed,'' said
his wife, Anne.
   ``With his passing, an era has ended and our beloved country
cries,'' Enos Mabuza, leader of the black homeland of Kwangane,
said of the white author who was also a prison administrator,
commentator, politician and public speaker.
   ``Paton was the champion of South Africa's oppressed, a
visionary who campaigned for peace, for freedom within the rule of
law and justice for all,'' he said.
   ``Cry, the Beloved Country,'' published in 1948, tells the story
of a Zulu priest in search of his son, who is being sought by
police for the murder of a white man. It has sold 15 million copies
in 20 languages and was made into a musical, ``Lost in the Stars,''
by composer Kurt Weill and playwright Maxwell Anderson. Only the
Bible outsells his book in South Africa.
   ``I have one great fear in my heart,'' says the main black
character at the end of the book. ``One day when they (the whites)
have turned to loving, they will find we are turned to hating.''
   That passage has been quoted often by Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, the prominent anti-apartheid campaigner and Nobel
peace laureate.
   President P.W. Botha said of Paton: ``Although he was a noted
critic of the government, he was respected for his sincerity, never
failing to temper his criticism with a recognition of positive
developments and the realities of the situation.''
   Paton wrote only four works of fiction but campaigned
unrelentingly against apartheid, under which the white minority
excludes blacks from national politics and restricts them to
segregated neighborhoods, schools and hospitals.
   Paton vowed to keep silent after the 1968 banning of the
multi-racial Liberal Party he helped found, but he began speaking
out publicly again in the early 1980s.
   Prior to his first novel, Paton served for 13 years as principal
of Diepkloof Reformatory, a home for 650 delinquent black boys aged
10 to 21 outside Johannesburg.
   Paton was 32 when he arrived at Diepkloof to find a prison with
high walls, no latrines and a staff that considered its main job to
be guard duty.
   When Paton left Diepkloof in 1948, the barbed wire was gone and
it had the lowest escape rate in the country. He became known as
``the man who pulled up the barbed wire and planted geraniums.''
   In his later years, Paton was regarded as the elder statesman of
South Africa's liberals. Some anti-apartheid groups considered him
too conservative, and he was tolerated by National Party supporters
who once considered him a traitor for his writings.
   ``Save the Beloved Country,'' a compilation of some of his
articles and speeches, was published in January.
   ``Journey Continued,'' a sequel to his autobiography, ``Toward
The Mountain,'' is due out at the end of April. The sequel focuses
on people with whom Paton worked in the early days of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   Mrs. Paton said there would be a private cremation service. She
said a public service would be held Saturday in Pietermaritzburg,
the southeasterm city where Paton was born. Another service will be
held next week in Johannesburg.
   Besides his wife, survivors include Paton's two sons from his
first marriage and five grandchildren. His first wife, Dorrie, died
in 1967.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis campaigned in a
conservative Jewish community Tuesday, declining to criticize rival
Jesse Jackson despite shouted invitations from some in the crowd.
   Dukakis, seeking Jewish support in next Tuesday's New York
presidential primary, met privately with Jewish leaders in the
Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn and later spoke to hundreds
of Hassidic and orthodox Jews who filled the street outside.
   It was the second day of meetings with Jewish leaders for the
Massachusetts governor, who came to the neighborhood just hours
after facing rivals Albert Gore Jr. and Jackson in a locally
televised debate.
   Gore earlier had said Dukakis has shown ``enthusiasm'' for
creation of a Palestinian state in the Middle East, something some
Jewish leaders oppose. Dukakis denied that during the debate.
   As Dukakis took questions from reporters in Brooklyn, some young
Hassidic Jews in the crowd shouted to him asking what he thought
about Jackson _ who has drawn the ire of some Jews for his
positions regarding Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and for
his 1984 reference to New York as ``Hymietown.''
   ``I have some disagreements with Rev. Jackson; I have some
disagreements with Sen. Gore,'' Dukakis said to reporters. ``I'm
going to run a strong campaign that puts my best foot forward ...
in the hope I can win suppport of the people of New York.''
   Dukakis referred to his own heritage as the son of Greek
immigrants and praised the largely Jewish community as ``a model of
what a caring community is all about, a recognition that we're all
in this together.''
   New York's primary campaign has focused on Middle East issues,
reflecting the fact that Jews generally make up close to
one-quarter of the Democratic primary electorate.
   Dukakis said he also planned to campaign in black and Hispanic
communities, and he went from Brooklyn to a health clinic in a
predominantly Hispanic section of New York City's Upper West Side.
There he talked of his commitment to basic health insurance and day
care, addressing several dozen people, most of them women who work
at the clinic and their children.
   In Borough Park, he was strongly endorsed by the council's
leader, Rabbi Morris Schmidman, who said a Palestinian state would
be ``a dagger at the heart and soul of Israel.'' Dukakis has said a
Palestinian state should be a matter of negotiations for Israel and
its neighbors.
   Also appearing with him was the area's congressman, Rep. Stephen
Solarz. He praised the work of Dukakis' wife Kitty as a member of a
national commission working to honor victims and survivors of the
Holocaust, ``of which there are more survivors here in Borough Park
and Brooklyn than any other city'' in America.
   The rabbi called Dukakis ``the best choice'' and said, ``I urge
my friends to follow me'' in voting for him.
   Some in the crowd, however, expressed reservations.
   Daniel Cohen, a Hebrew teacher, said, ``He was very vague in
regard to Israel. ... I find him hazy.''
   Several said they liked Gore, who has taken a strongly
pro-Israel stance recently, but they voiced concern that votes for
Gore would have the effect of enhancing Jackson's position in the
three-way primary.
   ``There is a fear of Jackson,'' said Cohen.
   A woman from Borough Park who would identify herself only as
Rachel said she liked Gore but ``we'd rather have Dukakis than to
give too much power to Jackson.''

<TEXT>
   A polygamist clan leader bombed a Mormon
chapel to bring about a ``final confrontation'' he believed would
trigger the downfall of church and state, a federal prosecutor said
Tuesday.
   U.S. Attorney Brent Ward's opening statement began the trial of
four clan members facing charges relating to the Jan. 16 chapel
bombing and a 13-day standoff that ended Jan. 28 in gunfire that
killed a state corrections officer.
   In addition to opening statements, the first witnesses were
called to testify.
   And U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins denied a defense motion to
move the trial out of Utah.
   Ward for the first time officially identified John Timothy
Singer as the clan member authorities believe killed Corrections
Lt. Fred House when officers attempted to capture clan leader Addam
Swapp and his brother with attack dogs.
   Singer, 21, son of clan matriarch Vickie Singer, has not been
charged in the death. State authorities say they will file murder
charges following the federal trial.
   ``Vickie Singer and Addam Swapp made it clear there would be no
surrender and that the nation, church and state would have to be
destroyed first,'' said Ward, who detailed the bombing of the Kamas
Stake Center and the standoff at the clan's Marion homestead.
   ``Evidence and witnesses will show the events were part of a
pattern of criminal activity having a common purpose,'' Ward said.
``Evidence will show in this case that Addam Swapp was the bomber.''
   ``You will hear evidence that this was more than just a bombing
_ that it was an invitation to a violent confrontation,'' Ward said.
   The clan blamed the state and the Mormon church for various
problems, including the death nine years ago of Mrs. Singer's
husband, John, who was killed in a confrontation with police.
   Swapp, 27, married to two of Mrs. Singer's daughters, is charged
with seven counts and Mrs. Singer, 45, eight counts. John Timothy
Singer and Swapp's brother, Jonathan Swapp, 21, are charged with
attempted murder of federal agents, assault on federal officers and
two firearms violations.
   Swapp and Mrs. Singer face the same counts, plus use of an
explosive to damage the chapel and use and possession of a bomb.
Mrs. Singer also is charged with possession of a sawed-off shotgun.
   Using an aerial photograph and a surveyor's diagram, Ward also
walked jurors through the sequence of events leading up to the
clan's shootout with police.
   Kathryn Collard, representing Mrs. Singer, said there was no
evidence specifically linking her client to the eight charges.
``Mrs. Singer's defense in this case is simple. It is the truth,''
she said. ``There was not anything so much as a threatening gesture
from Vickie Singer.''
   John Timothy Singer's attorney, Fred Metos, urged the jury to
look closely at the attempted murder charge and determine whether
his client had the malice and intent to kill.
   The government, he said, ``must show that John Timothy Singer,
or whoever did the shooting at these officers, had the specific
intent to cause their death.''
   ``Except he will tell you that he had no intention of harming
anyone. He just wanted to keep the dogs off his brother-in-law and
Jonathan Swapp,'' Metos said.
   Attorneys for the Swapp brothers reserved their opening
statements for later.
   The government called its first two witnesses: a couple who live
across the highway from the bombed church building. They testified
about hearing the blast and later finding the damage.

   Officials said Tuesday that a
juvenile court will try a Lebanese man charged in a TWA hijacking
in which a U.S. sailor was killed.
   If convicted in the youth court, Mohammed Hamadi would face a
maximum 10-year term. He had been scheduled to go on trial next
month as an adult and could have drawn a maximum life sentence.
   In West Germany defendants under 21 are tried in youth court.
Hamadi's 21st birthday came two days before the hijacking on June
15, 1985, according to the Frankfurt state court.
   ``However, a possibility exists that the perpetration of the
crime that he is accused of may have begun before June 13, 1985,
and goes back to the time of his adolescence,'' a court statement
said.
   ``Therefore, the case has been turned over to the youth court,''
it said.
   Hamadi was charged in February with murder, hostage-taking and
other crimes stemming from the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner to
Beirut during which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and
39 U.S. citizens were held hostage for 17 days.
   Moving the case to a youth court means the news media could be
barred from Hamadi's trial and proceedings may not begin for
months, authorities said.
   Judicial sources in Frankfurt said they believed Hamadi's trial
was not likely to start before the end of the year.
   ``The Hesse state youth court will now need time to study the
case files before it can decide on when Mohammed Hamadi's trial
will start,'' the court statement said.
   A federal Justice Ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the youth court could decide to exclude the press
from Hamadi's trial. He said the decision would not be made until
the trial begins.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987,
carrying liquid explosives and false documents.
   Last year, the United States asked for Hamadi's extradition on
air piracy and murder charges.
   The West German government refused the request after the
kidnapping in Beirut of West Germans Rudolf Cordes and Alfred
Schmidt in January 1987. It said he would be tried in West Germany
instead.
   Defense attorneys in Duesseldorf gave their closing arguments
Tuesday in the case of Hamadi's brother, Abbas.
   Abbas Hamadi is charged with kidnapping the two West Germans in
an attempt to force West German authorities to release his brother.
   Schmidt was released by his captors in September in what they
said was a ``goodwill gesture,'' but Cordes is still being held.

   Tipper Gore, wife of Democratic
presidential hopeful Albert Gore Jr., said today that the two
kissed on their first date when she was 16 and he was 17.
   ``Absolutely!'' declared the Tennessee senator's wife when
asked, during an interview with WVOX-WRTN radio, whether she and
her husband-to-be kissed their first time out together.
   Is he a good kisser?
   ``Well, take a look at our family and draw your own
conclusion,'' the mother of four said from her Washington home.
   Tipper Gore may be best known for her campaign against obscene
and violent lyrics in rock music. She is co-founder of the Parents'
Music Resource Center and author of ``Raising PG kids in an X-Rated
Society.''
   Mrs. Gore said she met her future husband at his high school
graduation party 23 years ago. ``We both had dates with different
people,'' she said. ``He called me the next day and we made a date
for the following weekend and we've been together ever since.''
   The two were married five years later, in 1970, after she
graduated from Boston University and he from Harvard.

<HEAD>Aviation Interests Form Coalition to Get More Airports,
Controllers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The leaders of often-feuding factions in
American aviation joined forces Tuesday to fight for more airports
and air traffic control support to meet the needs of commercial and
private air transportation.
   ``Unless we modernize the (air traffic system) quickly, we'll
choke off growth to the detriment of all,'' said Robert Crandall,
chairman of American Airlines.
   Crandall was among five airline chief executives, and leaders of
groups representing aircraft manufacturers, business flyers,
private and commercial pilots and airport officials who called a
news conference to announce a new organization to promote the
expansion of airspace and airport capacity.
   The group, calling itself Partnership for Improved Air Travel,
envisions spending up to $15 million over the next two years to
publicize the need for more airports and an improve air traffic
control system.
   The executives said they hoped to enlist the support of the
traveling public to pressure Congress into providing more funds for
an expansion of aviation capacity. Although some ``modest''
increase in aviation taxes might be needed, most of the additional
money would come from funds now bottled up in the federal aviation
trust fund, the coalition leaders said.
   The Reagan administration has denied repeatedly that any money
is being held back and has argued that the surplus in the $5
billion aviation trust fund is only temporary.
   The group listed as founding members all of the major U.S. air
carriers, aircraft manufacturers and 16 other organizations from
aviation labor unions to airport operators.
   ``The nation has not yet made a commitment to create an
(aviation) system that can efficiently meet today's demand and
anticipate tomorrow's,'' said Herbert Kelleher, chairman both of
Southwest Airlines and of the new coalition.
   He and other airline executives said that unless the airspace
and ground capacity is expanded, flight delays and congestion will
not only continue but become more serious each year. The result
will be government-imposed constraints that will translate into
higher air fares, the executives suggested.
   The coalition voiced many of the same complaints heard before
from the aviation industry: too few air traffic controllers are
being hired and trained, federal efforts to modernize the air
traffic control technology is way behind schedule, there are too
few airports and the Federal Aviation Administration needs to be
restructured because it is hamstrung by bureacratic restrictions.
   ``There's not enough manpower, there are too few facilities,
equipment is outdated and the (the air traffic) system's management
structure is ill-suited to its mission,'' said American Airlines'
Crandall.
   Kellerer alluded to the ``unique alliance'' that is represented
by the coalition, which includes not only the largest air carriers
but also groups representing aviation labor and the pilots of
small, general aviation aircraft.
   ``We all share a common ground in wanting to modernize the
(aviation) system,'' added Kellerer.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley briefly address the group
and acknowledged that the federal government ``cannot keep up with
the rapidly changing industry'' spawned by airline deregulation.
``We are ill-equipped to that kind of dynamic,'' he said.
   Burnley in the past has called for Congress to enact legislation
that would allow the FAA to streamline its procurement procedures
and personnel policies so that they may better react to sudden
changes in the aviation industry.

   A weary Police Chief Billy Prince said Tuesday he
is quitting a department in turmoil over public accountability, the
treatment of minorities and slayings of officers in a city he
claims breeds cop-haters.
   Prince came into office six years ago a young reformer but left
an entrenched insider. He tried to curb the use of deadly force but
presided over one of the bloodiest times in department history
before deciding the tension was too much.
   ``I woke up Easter Sunday and just didn't feel good about
returning,'' Prince said at a news conference. ``I told my wife
then, `I think it's time for me to go.'''
   Prince, 45, said he was stepping down immediately but would
serve in an advisory role through the summer. City Manager Richard
Knight appointed first Assistant Police Chief Louie C. Caudell as
interim chief in the nation's seventh-largest city.
   In recent months, Prince had come under fire for criticizing
City Council members and opposing efforts to increase the
accountability of a department embattled over recent police
shootings of black residents.
   At the request of local minority groups, the U.S. House
subcommittee on criminal justice held a day-long hearing in May
1987 into the department's use of deadly force but did not issue a
report.
   Within minutes of Prince's announcement, black City Council
members who have been critics of the department called for a black
chief, and insisted the new chief be an outsider. Caudell is white.
   Police and city leaders say Prince leaves a legacy of tension
that will mark the search for a new chief, the continuing struggle
over a citizens' review board and perhaps even the 1989 race for
mayor.
   Supporters of Prince, including one law-and-order city
councilman already talking about running for mayor, criticized
Mayor Annette Strauss and called the retiring chief a scapegoat who
was ``hounded out of office.''
   The mayor denied Prince was forced out, and the 24-year Dallas
police veteran said his decision to resign was ``totally my own.''
   Monica Smith, head of the Dallas Police Association, said Prince
was a casualty of the recent deaths of several officers, not of
political infighting. She saw more trouble on the horizon over
Prince's successor.
   The chief angered many opponents with an outburst in January
after a homeless black vagrant shot white Officer John Glenn Chase
in a downtown parking lot.
   He went on television to proclaim that city leaders' criticism
of his department had created a public so hostile that such a death
was inevitable. He then refused to back down even after Strauss
demanded an apology.
   Knight, who is black, also warned Prince against making public
remarks about the council.
   The department already had been facing criticism for the police
shootings of two black people.
   A 70-year-old black woman was shot to death by an officer
responding to a burglary call at her home in October 1986. After
Prince fired the officer, the Dallas Police Association passed a
``no confidence'' vote on the chief.
   Police also shot dead a teen-age black girl during a drug raid
at an apartment complex in November 1987.
   Prince sharpened his differences with the City Council last year
when he lobbied against an expansion of the powers of the review
board to evaluate the use of police force and the creation of a
special office to review minority hirings and promotions. The
council introduced both changes in December.
   The feud with the City Council and the Chase shooting has
produced a backlash of support for the police, and the DPA is
seeking to go over the heads of council members and force a
referendum on the review board.

<TEXT>
   The troubled PTL ministry tried Tuesday to
auction the home used by former leaders Jim and Tammy Bakker, but
there were no bidders for the plush, million-dollar mansion.
   The auction of that home and eight other properties, chiefly
homes used by other ministry officials, raised only a fraction of
the $4 million that ministry officials had hoped for.
   The ministry accepted bids on five of the nine properties,
raising about $596,500. The Bakker home attracted no bids, bids on
two other properties were deemed insufficient, and a $425,000 bid
on former PTL President Richard Dortch's home is still being
considered, said PTL Trustee David Clark.
   Clark said the setback means the ministry based in nearby Fort
Mill will have to re-examine its options for raising $5.3 million
by a May 2 bankruptcy court deadline.
   ``I believe that we will make it in one way or another,'' Clark
said.
   The 9,300-square-foot lakeside house used by the Bakker and his
wife before he resigned a year ago amid a sex scandal boasts three
kitchens, four bedrooms and 5{ bathrooms.
   The grounds include a two-story, heated and air-conditioned
playhouse; a guardhouse; boardwalks to a white, sandy beach on
nearby Lake Wylie; and a large dock where the Bakkers once kept
their 58-foot houseboat and a small power cruiser.
   It was built in 1976 and enlarged four times after PTL bought it
in 1981 to be used as a parsonage by the Bakkers and their two
children.
   Auctioneer Rodney L. Robinson opened the sale of the Bakkers'
house by asking for $900,000. He stopped the auction when his
asking price fell to $500,000 without any takers. The house was
valued at about $1 million.
   ``We didn't get an offer that I thought was substantial enough
to open the bidding,'' Robinson said afterward. About 40 bidders
participated in the 30-minute auction.
   One of the rejected bids was $900,000 for 33 acres of
undeveloped land. Clark said that property and  No official cause has been
given for the explosions that ripped
through the ammunition depot, sending rockets showering across the
cities.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that agents from the
pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan were apparently responsible.
   According to the newspaper, the blast was caused by three
incendiary devices carried to the ammunition dump by trucks bearing
Afghan license plates and equipped with time fuses. They were
exploded in sequence, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said Pakistani
military experts had told U.S. officials that this was the cause of
the blast.
   Unidentified U.S. sources told the newspaper the explosions
wiped out a major source of CIA-supplied tactical assault weapons
for guerrillas battling the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan.
   The Pakistani Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Mohammad Khan
Junejo and the Senate met Tuesday to review the situation.
   Pakistani television said that during the Cabinet meeting, it
was decided that a committee investigating the explosion should
submit its findings with recommendations within 10 days and that
they will be made public.

   Satanic and ritualistic practices and beliefs
may be a motivating factor in a one form of child abuse, a
children's welfare group said Tuesday.
   ``People have now moved to a new level of how to assault
children,'' said Dr. Daniel Saxton of Childhelp USA. ``Just abusing
the child in the home is not enough. We've gotten into this very
sadistic kind of stuff with children.''
   Saxton, who is director of a Childhelp hotline, based his
remarks on initial findings of a national study to determine the
extent of cult involvement in specific abuse cases. The results
represent 36 separate cases, documented by 59 questionnaires from
16 states.
   He said 97 percent of children reported male and female abusers,
50 percent described six or more perpetrators, and more than 30
percent told of more than 11 persons involved.
   Sixty percent of the children responding to the questionnaires
indicated the incidents lasted from seven months to two years.
   Seventy-eight percent of the children said they were
photographed in the nude, while more than 60 percent said they were
photographed during sexual activity.
   In two-thirds of cases, Sexton said the children said they were
drugged, saw or participated in rituals, animal killings and
mutilations as part of the incident. About half said they were
taken to cemeteries and curches for these rituals.
   Roughly 46 percent of the children were forced to eat or drink
bodily waste, while a little more than 40 percent were forced to
ingest what they were told was human flesh or blood.
   Although Sexton said it would be premature to say the figures
represent a national trend, he is receiving calls from therapists
nationwide about adult patients exhibiting behavior or
experienceing dreams similar to those of some sexually abused
children.
   Sexton told of an incident in which a therapist had a patient
who remembered having a baby when she was 13, but could not
remember what happened to the child.
   ``Two days later I get a call from this therapist saying, `Good
God, this woman remembers having to kill her child,''' he said.
Sexton also mentioned that one of his adult patients, who had been
a sexual abuse victim from ages 12 through 16, gave birth to five
children, all of whom ``disappeared'' in the same manner.
   Childhelp USA is California-based, non-profit organization that
assists child abuse victims and their families through public
education, clinical programs, research and its 24-hour child abuse
hotline.
   According to the information from hotline's 148,452 calls last
year, the incidence of sexual and physical child abuse is more than
double that of the nationally accepted figures. National statistics
indicate 11 percent of abuse reports are sexual, while 36 percent
of the hotline calls were for sexual abuse.
   Similarily, national figures indicate 15.5 percent of reported
abuse is physical, but calls for physical abuse totaled 37 percent
of the hotline calls last year.
   Randall Silverston, Childhelp research director, said many
children are being exposed to the threat of AIDS as a result of
sexual abuse. The organization and the University of California,
Irvine, were asking the National Institutes of Health to fund a
three-year study of those children who are in the high-risk
category.

   A delegation of Soviets arrived in Washington
on Tuesday for a second round of talks about on-site monitoring to
verify an arms control pact signed at the summit last December, a
U.S. spokesman said.
   The dozen or so Soviets arrived at Dulles International Airport
on an Aeroflot flight from Moscow and were to open talks Wedneday
with an American team headed by Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, said the
spokesman, Cmdr. Ken Pease.
   The Soviet team is headed by Gen. Vladimir Medvedev, who helped
negotiate the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty under which
the superpowers are to destroy nuclear-tipped missiles with ranges
from 300 to 3,000 miles.
   Lajoie heads the On-Site Inspection Agency, created shortly
after President Reagan and Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
signed the INF accord at the Washington summit last December.
   In talks scheduled to last until Saturday, Lajoie and Medvedev
will discuss what a U.S. official called ``housekeeping details,''
such as living quarters for the inspectors, the transportation of
equipment, and call signs that aircraft carrying the teams will use
while in the other's airspace, said American officials.
   The U.S. agency will select and train an estimated 125 people to
monitor the destruction of the Soviet missiles and verify that no
more are deployed.
   Thirty days after Reagan and Gorbachev notify each other that
the treaty has been ratified and is in effect, members of the U.S.
teams will visit 126 sites in the Soviet Union, six in East
Germany, and one in Czechoslovakia over two months to verify data
supplied by the Soviets concerning their forces.
   The Soviets will visit 21 sites in the United States and Western
Europe where the missiles have been made or deployed.
   Once those inspections are complete, teams of 30 U.S. inspectors
will be stationed for three months at a stretch over the next 13
years in the small city of Votkinsk near the Ural Mountains, where
the Soviets produce a longer range missile that resembles the
SS-20, one of the weapons banned under the INF pact.
   The Soviets will station similar teams in Magna, Utah, where the
United States has been producing components of Pershing 2 missiles,
also to be eliminated under the treaty.

   Federal housing officials plan to
significantly increase the number of people getting vouchers to
help pay their rent, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce said Tuesday.
   The voucher program, the Reagan administration's alternative to
building more public housing, now assists about 100,000 low-income
families, with another 34,000 to be added by the fall, Pierce told
a House Appropriations subcommittee.
   HUD plans to add another 100,000 families in 1989, he said.
   Rather than subsidizing housing units, the program gives poor
families a voucher which can be used to pay a portion of the rent
on living space they choose for themselves. The value of the
voucher is fixed according to each family's income, leaving the
amount of additional rent flexible. The program was made permanent
by Congress last year.
   ``Vouchers give families the dignity of choice, offering them
the opportunity to locate near family and friends, schools,
churches and jobs,'' rather than in public housing projects, said
Pierce. He appeared before the subcommittee on HUD-independent
agencies to discuss his $21.6 billion budget request for fiscal
1989. HUD's 1988 budget is $18.6 billion.
   Pierce said the number of households to be assisted by various
HUD programs would increase from 4.3 million in 1988 to 4.4 million
next year.
   Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass., questioned
Pierce's conclusion that the major problem for low-income families
is not the availability of houses but their affordability. Boland
said some studies show a severe shortage of low-income housing as
units built in the 1960s are converted into more profitable uses.
   Pierce quoted Commerce Department statistics putting rental
vacancy rates at their highest in 20 years, with an 8.4 percent
vacancy rate among apartments renting between $200 and $249 a month.
   Boland also questioned HUD's estimate last week that it would
take between $7.5 billion and $9.2 billion to bring the nation's
1.3 million public housing units up to modern safety and sanitation
standards. He said other estimates put the cost as high as $20
billion.
   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., asked Pierce if he is concerned that
many middle-income people are being priced out of the housing
market.
   ``I'm not as disturbed as you, because I don't see that it is
such a big problem,'' the secretary said.
   Pierce, who is the only Cabinet member still in office from
among President Reagan's original appointees, noted record sales
and record housing starts in recent years. ``Somebody's buying the
homes,'' he said.
   Thomas Demery, assistant secretary for housing, told the
subcommittee several factors have affected middle-class families'
ability to buy homes, including a decline in savings brought about
partly by increased education costs.
   Meanwhile, former developer James Rouse told a Senate
subcommittee that Congress should appropriate another $3.4 billion
a year to support a federal program to increase the supply of
low-income and rental housing by the year 2000.
   Rouse, who chaired an ad hoc committee which studied housing
needs in the United States, told a Senate banking subcommittee that
the nation faces the worst housing crisis in the past 10 years.
   Rouse, who headed his own development company and now is
chairman and chief executive officer of The Enterprise Foundation,
said the $3.4 billion would be added to the $13.6 billion currently
available.
   Half of the $3.4 billion would be allocated to the states, which
would be required to match the funds by various means: providing
land or distributing money to local authorities. The other half
would go directly to cities which would have wide discretion for
use of the funds but would not be required to match the money.

<HEAD>World Bank Establishes Body To Insure Against War Losses</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New throughout with Conable news conference</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   World Bank President Barber Conable on Tuesday
announced the formation of a worldwide body to insure private
investors against loss from war and other hostile actions.
   ``The flow of private investment must be strengthened,'' Conable
told a news conference while saying investors put $16 billion into
Third World countries in 1981 and only $10 billion in 1987.
   The new Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency has 29
countries which formally have accepted membership. Nine of them are
industrial nations, including the United States and Britain, whose
ratifications arrived Tuesday. Another 34 governments of both
industrial and Third World countries have signed the agreement but
not yet ratified it.
   So far, Ecuador is the only Latin American government to ratify.
Others, including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, have not signed.
Some Latin American countries have a strong tradition against
allowing foreigners any share in settling disputes with their
citizens, as might have to be done under the agreement setting up
the agency.
   Conable said the new body's Governing Council will hold its
first meeting in Washington on June 8 to adopt bylaws and choose a
board of directors. He said he expects the new agency to be doing
business by the end of the year.
   He added that after it is in operation it can take up a proposal
that originated with Japanese Financer Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to
enable it to guarantee bank loans as well. Such operations would
greatly broaden its scope and probably require more capital.
   The object of the new agency is to attract more direct
investment into Third World countries, to help them build the
industries they need so they can produce more goods, create jobs
and make more payments on their debts. New investments also would
reduce the need to add to their existing debt, now over $1 trillion.
   It will begin with $1.08 billion, but only 10 percent of that
will be paid in cash by the member governments. Conable will be its
president as well as heading the bank.
   The agency's immediate future was assured when Congress voted
$44 million for U.S. participation at the end of last year. The
U.S. contribution will be the largest.
   The United States already has its own agency to insure American
investors, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. MIGA's services
will be available to investors from all member countries. Citizens
of a host country also can be protected if they bring home assets
from abroad.
   That provision is designed to help solve a major problem in
Third World nations, the flight of billions of dollars that their
citizens have sent to the United States and other havens considered
safer than their own territory.
   In addition to protecting investors against war and civil
disturbances, the agency's insurance policies will cut a company's
losses if the government of a country where the money is invested
restricts the right to take money out of the country, expropriates
property or repudiates a contract.
   Other risks also can be covered by a decision of the agency's
board of directors.

   Lawyers for Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and three
co-defendants charged in the Iran-Contra affair urged a federal
judge on Tuesday to put off their trial until next year to give
them sufficient time to prepare a defense.
   Attorneys for North, along with former national security adviser
John M. Poindexter and two arms dealers, retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, objected to the
prosecution's proposal to begin the trial in July, instead
proposing a March 1989 date.
   ``We have a million documents in the case. Evelyn Wood could not
read those documents between now and July,'' said North's attorney,
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., referring to the founder of the famous
speed-reading course.
   ``There is no conceivable way'' of disposing of the many
pretrial issues before early next year, said Sullivan, who proposed
that the trial begin two months after President Reagan leaves
office.
   ``I'm frightened to have a trial during a political election
year,'' Sullivan told U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   Gesell, who said he was concerned about ``having the trial under
way while ballots were being cast,'' and independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh both proposed starting the trial in July.
   Walsh said the trial could take three or four months, but
defense lawyers suggested it could take even longer. ``This is a
difficult case,'' Walsh said. But ``it's not going to be made any
easier by just putting off the trial date.''
   The possibility of a presidential pardon for North and
Poindexter was not mentioned at the hearing, but it is widely
believed that the defense would want to take advantage of such a
possibility.
   The White House has said Reagan has not considered pardons, but
the president has repeatedly said he thought the defendants did
nothing illegal.
   At the outset of the hearing, Gesell said ``this case is not
going to be on a slow track. There is no need for it to be on a
slow track.''
   But a number of obstacles to a summer trial were raised during
the 3{-hour hearing, the first since the four defendants were
arraigned on charges they conspired to illegally divert profits to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels from the U.S.-Iran arms sales.
   These include the issue of whether Walsh obtained evidence
against the defendants from their compelled testimony to Congress,
as well as a complicated procedure for government review of 300,000
classified documents that Gesell ruled should be given to the
defense.
   Unless those procedures can be streamlined, ``were talking about
a trial next year at the earliest,'' Gesell said.
   Walsh said he could make 50,000 pages available by month's end
following a review of the sensitive documents by an interagency
task force for material that might compromise U.S. intelligence
operations.
   Gesell expressed frustration at the detailed review procedure
and warned that the case would be dismissed if the government
doesn't declassify the documents needed by both the prosecution and
defense.
   ``The classification system must be adjusted to the needs of
this case or the case will collapse,'' Gesell said.
   The defendants should have the documents, the judge said,
because ``they are entitled to show to the jury what motivated
them, why they did it, who told them to do it, and what was going
on.''
   ``I have to allow them that chance to give them a fair trial.''
   Gesell also invited a challenge to the constitutionality of the
Classified Information Procedures Act when Barry Simon, one of
North's attorneys, complained that the security measures the law
prescribes would hamper defense preparation for trial.
   Gesell scheduled an April 25 hearing at which Walsh will outline
procedures followed by his office to prevent his staff from being
exposed to the congressional testimony of the defendants.
   The defense will get an opportunity at that time to present
evidence that at least one witness gave grand jury testimony that
was influenced by what the defendants told the House and Senate
committees that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   The law prohibits Walsh from using the compelled congressional
testimony of North, Poindexter and Hakim as evidence against them.
Unlike his co-defendants, Secord testified on Capitol Hill without
a grant of limited immunity from prosecution.
   Gesell warned that he will not proceed to trial unless he is
satisfied that Walsh obtained his evidence against the defendants
independently of their congressional testimony.
   ``If we don't have a case to be tried, we are not going to try
it,'' the judge said.
   Earlier, Gesell scolded the prosecution for playing a ``cat and
mouse'' game by delaying the production of documents he had ordered
turned over to the defense.
   ``We're not here to play games,'' said Walsh, who added that the
defense already has received more than 30,000 documents, including
the records of Swiss bank accounts through which the arms sales
were brokered.

   A hijacked jet left Cyprus for Algeria on
Wednesday carrying more than 30 hostages held for over a week by
Moslem gunmen demanding freedom for terrorists jailed in Kuwait.
   The blue-and-white Boeing 747 took off at 1:17 a.m. Wednesday
(6:17 p.m. EDT Tuesday) after the hijackers freed 12 hostages.
   Forty people were believed on board the aircraft after the
latest release, including a half-dozen hijackers. The plane was
seized a week ago by gunmen demanding freedom for 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists held in Kuwait.
   The plane was refueled after repeated demands by the hijackers,
who have killed two hostages in Larnaca.
   The freed passengers were driven from the Boeing 747 at around
10:25 p.m. (3:25 p.m. EDT) then taken to Larnaca General Hospital,
reporters at the scene and hospital officials said.
   A hijacker told the tower the released included two Palestinians
with Jordanian passports and 10 others who were sick, poor or had
numerous children.
   They said the releases were a ``goodwill'' gesture but added
also that the Jordanian nationals were freed as a ``present to the
uprising in Palestine,'' a reference to four months of anti-Israeli
violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The plane's engines started shortly after the latest passengers
were released, and loud bangs rang out across the tarmac. Officials
said the noise was caused by the engines.
   PLO and government negotiators held talks with the hijackers
before the latest hostages were being freed.
   The hijackers said earlier in the day that they had on death
shrouds. One hijacker, in a statement radioed to the Larnaca
Airport control tower, cited Koranic verses usually read at
funerals that said ``those killed in the name of God are always
alive.''
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat was quoted today as saying the
hijackers want to fly to Algeria and ``arrangements are being made
to this end.'' The Kuwait News Agency said Arafat told reporters in
Kuwait he expected the hijacking to end tonight.
   In London, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Javad Larijana said
Iran had offered to take the jet by force after it was forced to
land in Iran last week, but Kuwait rejected the idea.
   At one point today, the hijackers radioed the control tower
demanding the plane be refueled in 45 minutes. The deadline passed
without incident after two Palestine Liberation Organization
officials went out on the tarmac and spoke with the hijackers.
   One hijacker later radioed that they had extended the deadline
``for a short time ... to permit the mediators to act'' in getting
the plane refueled.
   ``We are warning against false promises,'' he said in broken
English.
   When a C-130 military transport landed a short time later, one
of the hijackers screamed over the radio: ``Identify this plane.''
   The tower replied it was a Greek air force plane carrying
supplies.
   The hijacker replied: ``My men were about to shoot at it.''
   The hijackers of the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 shot and killed a
second passenger Monday. The hijackers are demanding Kuwait free 17
convicted terrorists and have said they want to leave for an
unspecified ``neutral country.''
   The hijackers are armed with grenades and handguns. They have
repeatedly threatened to blow up the plane since the hijacking
began a week ago.
   The hijackers' statement today indicated, as had been suspected,
that the gunmen are Shiite Moslems.
   The statement said ``hail the glory of Imam Mahdi,'' the
messiah-like holy person Shiites believe will one day appear on
earth. Only Shiite Moslems revere the imams, or saints, among the
Islamic sects.
   The 17 pro-Iranian terrorists whose freedom is sought by the
hijackers were convicted in 1984 of bombing the U.S. and French
embassies in Kuwait. The emirate has rejected the demand. All but
one of the 17 are Shiites.
   Among those on the plane are three members of Kuwait's royal
family, a man and two women.
   Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed Al-Sabah of Kuwait said
Monday his country is prepared to lose more hostages rather than
give in.
   ``We will try our utmost to protect our dear ones aboard the
plane, but we will not surrender to any blackmail, even if we lose
more of them,'' he said. He added that the presence of three
members of the ruling Al-Sabah family aboard the jet ``will not
influence our decision.''
   Terrorist groups in Lebanon have threatened to kill foreign
hostages they are holding, including three Americans, if security
forces storm the plane. Two of the Americans are held by a group
that also has demanded freedom for the 17 terrorists jailed in
Kuwait.
   In today's statement, the hijackers declared in classical,
Koranic Arabic: ``We have decided to call our plane the plane of
greatest martyrdom and death. Death with glory is better than life
under humiliation... We call on the Kuwaiti people to revolt
against the Kuwaiti dictatorship. We'd like to point out we're not
against the people of Kuwait, but against the regime.''
   They added: ``We have decided to wear the death shrouds under
our clothes and that either all our 17 brothers come back to us or
else we shall meet, in our shrouds, in the heaven of eternal
happiness.''
   The Kuwait News Agency identified the man killed Monday as
Khalid Ayyub Ismail Ayyub Bandar, a 20-year-old worker for Kuwait's
fire brigade. On Saturday, the hijackers killed another man, also a
Kuwaiti.
   The plane was hijacked April 5 with 112 people aboard on a
flight from Bangkok to Kuwait and forced down in Iran, where 57
people were freed. The jet left Iran on Friday after refueling.
   After Lebanon and Syria refused to let it land, the plane flew
to Larnaca.
   One hostage was freed in Larnaca on Saturday.

   A twin-engine charter plane
crashed Tuesday night in South Africa's main gold mining region,
killing all 23 people on board, a government spokesman said.
   The World War II-vintage Dakota crashed about 90 miles northeast
of Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State, said Leon Els, a
spokesman for the Department of Transportation.
   It had taken off from Bloemfontein for Johannesburg.
   There was no immediate word on the cause of the crash or the
identities of those on board the plane owned by United Airline, a
private domestic carrier.
   The South African Press Association said the plane was carrying
jockeys and horse racing officials returning to Johannesburg from a
race in Bloemfontein.
   The news agency said there was an unconfirmed report the plane
burst into flames before it crashed.

   Boeing Co. officials Tuesday defended
their widebody jets against complaints of serious quality control
problems from at least three airlines.
   Phil Condit, executive vice president for Boeing Commerical
Airplanes, said recent publicity about the complaints against its
747s and 767s stemmed partly from the company's open way of dealing
with its problems, which has made many workers aware of items that
need improving.
   ``Air transportation is the safest transportation mode there
is'' and is getting even safer because airlines, manufacturers and
regulatory agencies work together to identify and correct problems,
Condit said.
   ``I could not be prouder than I am about the kind of employee we
have in this country. ... The people are dedicated and proud of
what they build,'' he told reporters at Boeing's Everett plant,
where the widebodies are made.
   One airline complained specifically that the aerospace company's
workers seemed oblivious that defects could compromise an
aircraft's safety.
   Boeing's news conference came one day after the Federal Aviation
Administration confirmed it has issued 50 directives in the last
two years telling airlines to fix various problems with Boeing jets.
   The most recent warning was issued Friday concerning possible
fuel leaks in the cargo area of Boeing's 747-200 series of jets.
The leaks can be caused by a bolt giving way in a wing section, and
the FAA ordered airlines to inspect them before returning the
planes to service.
   Boeing officials said the order applied to 317 operating
747-200s.
   Airlines, Boeing and FAA officials have said that none of the
defects cited has been linked to a crash or other major damage.
   However, Friday's directive warned, ``Fuel in this compartment
could result in a fire and substantial damage.''
   Nick Wantiez of the Seattle FAA office said Tuesday the
directive came after reports of incidents by Japan Air Lines,
Northwest Airlines, Lufthansa, Air India, Aerolineas Argentinas and
a leasing company, starting Nov. 21 with a JAL report in Los
Angeles of a fuel leak.
   Condit said the recent publicity presented only a ``snapshot''
view of Boeing's continuing efforts to see how its planes can be
improved.
   He also said Boeing has become more open with its workers and
has shared letters of complaint from airline customers with top
managers and their staffs. That openness makes it more likely the
public will hear about the complaints, he said.
   Wantiez said the agency has expanded its normal monitoring of
production at Boeing to include recent complaints by airlines,
which range from wrong parts to incorrectly installed firefighting
systems.
   ``We are putting together a plan this week to deal with these
complaints and to determine what actions must be taken to assure
compliance with federal regulations,'' Wantiez said.
   Complaints have been sent to Boeing by British Airways, Japan
Air Lines and All Nippon Airways, a domestic Japanese carrier.
   Gary Reich, an aerospace industry analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York, said airlines may be taking an opportunity
to improve their leverage with Boeing, the world's biggest maker of
commercial aircraft.
   ``I think that what the airlines are doing is holding Boeing's
feet to the fire,'' Reich said. ``They want an airplane with
absolutely no defects now.''

   The White House said Tuesday that President
Reagan was upset and it was an ``outrage'' that former presidential
spokesman Larry Speakes had made up quotes and given them to
reporters as Reagan's words.
   ``Everyone is appalled that he made up quotes,'' said spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater, who replaced Speakes 14 months ago.
   In a kiss-and-tell book that has roiled White House officials,
Speakes disclosed that he made up a widely reported statement that
was attributed to Reagan during his first summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985.
   In another instance, when a Korean Air Lines passenger jet was
shot down by the Soviets in 1983, the president ``had almost
nothing to say'' during meetings with the Cabinet and congressional
leaders, Speakes said. So, he said, he took statements made by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and attributed them to Reagan.
   Speakes said Tuesday that he subsequently told the president
what he had done and Reagan ``never objected.''
   Fitzwater, at a news briefing dominated by questions about
Speakes' revelation, blasted his predecessor, who in his six years
as White House spokesman had boasted that he never lied to the
press.
   ``It's a damned outrage, that's what it is,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``I resent it so much. It casts asperions on the presidency and
on my position ... It's wrong.... He shouldn't have done it and ...
I won't do it,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said he had not talked to the president, ``but I'm sure he
would be upset about it. I'm sure he is.'' Later, after conferring
with the president, Fitzwater said, ``I stand by my comments.''
And, another White House official, speaking anonymously, said
flatly, ``The president is upset about the book.''
   James Brady, the White House spokesman shot during the 1981
assassination attempt on Reagan, said ``the best writer for the
president is the president himself.''
   ``No one talks for President Reagan but President Reagan,'' said
Brady, who still holds the title of White House press secretary and
goes to the office about once a week. ``We had a half-joke around
the office, let Reagan be Reagan.''
   Conservative leaders who met with Reagan on Tuesday also were
angry. ``I think Larry Speakes has done a disservice to the
president,'' said Peter Flaherty, chairman of Citizens for Reagan.
   Paul Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation, said, ``The
president is ill-served by all of these people who are in public
service and then write books the minute they get out and reveal
things that ought not to be revealed.
   ``All they're in it for is making a buck ... and frankly, they
ought to be ashamed of themselves,'' Weyrich said.
   Speakes had no reaction to the White House statements. ``I'd be
better off not to comment,'' he said in a telephone interview from
New York, where he is vice president for communications at Merrill
Lynch Corp.
   However, he offered no apologies, saying ``It's an honest book.''
   Speakes said the two instances of phony quotes he cited ``were
the only two that I specifically recall. ... It was a case of
knowing the president well and knowing how he felt about the events
taking place and knowing what he would say.''
   He said he had told Reagan about the quotes.
   ``I generally told him, you know, what I had done, you know, and
the reasons for doing it. He never objected to, you know, these
cases where I said, you know, I've gone ahead and done this,''
Speakes said.
   In his book, ``Speaking Out,'' Speakes recalled it was Shultz
who said the shooting down of the Korean airliner was not a problem
between the United States and the Soviet Union, but ``a Soviet vs.
the world problem.''
   However, Speakes told reporters the president had said those
words. He also attributed to Reagan some of Shultz's suggestions
about retaliatory action.
   ``My decision to put Shultz's words in Reagan's mouth played
well and neither of them complained,'' Speakes wrote.
   Discussing the summit, Speakes said he ``felt that Gorbachev was
really getting the advantage over us in his give-and-take with
reporters, while Reagan was very tentative and stilted'' in his
comments.
   ``Fearing that Reagan was losing the media version of Star Wars,
I instructed Mark Weinberg (a White House press aide) to draft some
quotes for the president,'' Speakes wrote.
   ``I polished the quotes and told the press that while the two
leaders stood together at the end of one session, the president
said to Gorbachev, `There is much that divides us, but I believe
the world breathes easier because we are talking here together.'''
   ``Another Reagan quote which we manufactured that received
extensive play in the press was, `Our differences are serious, but
so is our commitment to improving understanding,''' Speakes wrote.
   ``In retrospect, it was clearly wrong to take such liberties,''
he added. ``Certainly, Reagan would not have disavowed the words,
but the Soviets could have said they never heard anything like
that. Luckily, the Russians didn't dispute the quotes and I had
been able to spruce up the president's image by taking a bit of
liberty with my PR man's license.''
   Fitzwater, commenting on his policy, said, ``I don't make up
quotes and I don't just write them and run them by the president.
   ``On the other hand, the whole business of communication is the
drafting of material that the president may use in one form or
another, whether it's a speech or a statement or quotes on a
various issue that tell what the president thinks,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>City Gives Adoption Agency Notice of Closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Wolfram Brueck said Tuesday
a private adoption agency is ``damaging the basic dignity of
mankind'' and will be closed in a week unless it proves it is
operating legally.
   The Hamel and Keller service sells babies to adoptive parents
for a profit.
   Private adoption agencies are illegal in West Germany, but Hamel
and Keller claims there is a loophole in the law involving a
declaration of fatherhood.
   Uwe Hamel told The Associated Press after hearing of the city's
order: ``I am not concerned about this at all. I will simply
continue.''
   One of the agency's advertisements reads: ``I can arrange
immediately for a child. The prices: 30,000 marks ($18,000) for a
child from the Middle East; 15,000 marks ($9,000) for a child from
the Far East; 45,000 marks ($27,000) for a German child.''
   According to the agency, a prospective adoptive father declares
an illegimate child to be his and makes a contract with the baby's
mother, who is paid a fee to verify the claim. The man then applies
to a court for the child to be declared his legitimate offspring.
   Hamel's agency has operated for two months. He claims it has
arranged the adoptions of nine babies.

   A teary-eyed William Stern on Tuesday
gave his daughter to surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould for
a day of court-ordered visitation.
   Stern carried the 2-year-old girl into a Bergen County youth
center, and a smiling Mrs. Whitehead-Gould emerged with the child
and drove her to an unknown location.
   The visit is one of the first since a judge on April 6 awarded
Mrs. Whitehead-Gould gradually expanded, unsupervised visitation
with the child, known as Baby M in court papers and legally named
Melissa Stern.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who sparked a landmark court case by
refusing to part with the baby she bore under a $10,000 contract,
is allowed to spend one six-hour day a week with the child, with
the schedule expanded over the year to include overnights, holidays
and a three-week vacation next summer.
   Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, have custody of Melissa.
   A judge ordered attorneys not to comment on the specifics of
visitation or describe the visits. Calls to attorneys in the case
late Tuesday were not answered.

<HEAD>Publisher Says Free and Paid Newspapers Have Common Rivals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers that sell their issues and those that
distribute free have greater rivals than each other, Ralph
Ingersoll, chairman of Ingersoll Publications Co., said Tuesday.
   Ingersoll's company is the largest free-circulation publisher in
the United States, but publishes other newspapers with paid
circulation. He bought 10 regional British papers of both kinds in
January.
   ``In the United States, there are still paid daily publishers
who view free newspapers of any kind as a threatening phenomenon,
but we don't happen to feel that way ourselves,'' he told a
Financial Times conference on the newspaper industry.
   ``Free circulation and paid don't have to be pitched in mortal
combat. Indeed, both have more serious natural enemies, several of
which have yet to show their full strength in the U.K. (Britain).''
   He said the real rivals include development of local commercial
broadcasting, direct mail and outdoor advertising. Ingersoll said
his company publishes free-circulation newspapers wherever it
publishes paid papers in the United States.
   Also, he said, ``We publish free-circulation newspapers in
markets in which other publishers, paid or free, have defaulted on
their obligation to deliver dependable readership to local retail
advertisers.''
   Ingersoll Publications is the first foreign company to invest in
the British regional press, where ``the free versus paid wars ...
are relatively new,'' the publisher said.
   It acquired the Birmingham Post, Birmingham Evening Mail,
Coventry Evening Telegraph and the regional Sunday publication
Sunday Mercury, all paid newspapers, and six free weeklies in the
Midlands region.
   The privately held company publishes more than 40 daily papers,
including the Trentonian, and more than 200 weeklies. It has annual
revenues of $700 million and employs 11,000 people.
   ``It is arguable that the traditional paid daily no longer
exists,'' Ingersoll said, adding that papers rely on advertising
and not circulation revenue for their profits.
   He said daily newspaper circulation began deteriorating after
World War II because populations became more transient, sprawling
suburban markets developed and commerical broadcasting grew.
   Free papers moved into the gap, Ingersoll said.

   Movie director Bernardo Bertolucci, who was
prosecuted in Italy for ``Last Tango in Paris,'' was a national
hero Tuesday after ``The Last Emperor'' swept the Academy Awards.
   It won nine Oscars, including best picture and best director.
   Congratulatory messages poured in from President Francesco
Cossiga, other politicians and figures in the Italian movie
industry hailing the victory as a great day for Italy.
   Bertolucci said in an interview with state-run RAI-TV from
Hollywood that he hoped the prizes would give a boost to Italy's
flagging movie industry.
   Recalling his visit to the set in Italy of ``The Last Emperor,''
Cossiga said the awards ``underlined yet again the great merit of
Italian cinema and its authors.``
   The film was an international production but five Italians
shared in the awards, for art direction, cinematography, film
editing and direction.
   Bertolucci, 48, won acclaim for his 1970 film ``The Conformist''
but ran into legal problems in Italy two years later because of the
sexual content of ``Last Tango in Paris.''
   Obscenity charges were filed against him and the stars, Marlon
Brando and Maria Schneider.
   They were acquitted eventually, but the movie was released for
showing in Italy only last year after an appeals court ruled that
what once was considered obscene need no longer be classified that
way.
   At one point, a judge ordered all copies of the movie destroyed,
but after Bertolucci appealed to then-President Giovanni Leone the
court allowed copies to be kept in the National Cinema Library.
   ``My film has been spared execution and the verdict commuted to
a life term in the archives,'' the director said at the time.
   The awards Monday night brought the number of Oscars won by
Italians to 31. Two other Italian directors, Federico Fellini and
Vittorio De Sica, each won four Oscars, but in the foreign film
category.

<HEAD>Indian Museum Compromise Leaves Smithsonian Unhappy</HEAD>

   The New York City-based Museum of the American
Indian, which has long been searching for a more spacious home,
would move and stay in the same place under a compromise plan
revealed Tuesday.
   But as soon as the plan was announced, objections were raised by
the Smithsonian Institution, which has a stake in the negotiations.
   Under the proposal, the bulk of the museum collection would move
into the Custom House in lower Manhattan, while its current upper
Manhattan site remains open and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii,
pursues a plan for a National Museum of the American Indian in
Washington. The national museum would be part of the Smithsonian
Institution and have borrowing privileges from the New York Indian
museum.
   ``Instead of one museum, we get three,'' Sen. Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y., said in announcing the plan. He was flanked by
Inouye, who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs, and Reps. Charles Rangel and Ted Weiss, both New York
Democrats.
   However, Smithsonian Secretary Robert McC. Adams later issued a
statement calling the Smithsonian's association with the plan
``unwise and unworkable.''
   In a letter to Inouye released late Tuesday, Adams detailed his
objections, which include building a new museum to house borrowed
objects; placing undue financial burdens for the facility on the
Smithsonian; and not giving the Smithsonian sufficient authority
over the new museum.
   The Museum of the American Indian long has been starved for
space, visitors and funding. The 15,000-square-foot building in a
decaying neighborhood is too small to display more than about 1
percent of its million-artifact collection at a time, so most of
the objects have languished in a Bronx warehouse.
   The compromise was aimed at resolving a longstanding dispute
over where to house the collection amassed by George Gustav Heye
and established by his will. The trust stipulates that the
collection remain in New York state, spurring New York officials to
rebuff an offer in 1986 by Texas tycoon H. Ross Perot to move the
museum to Dallas.
   Adams suggested that the Smithsonian ``stand aside at this time
so that the possibility of making the New York Custom House
available to the Heye Foundation can be pursued.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press_</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A surprise spring storm dumped heavy snow in the western North
Carolina mountains and scattered rain and a few thundershowers over
the southern Atlantic Coast region into Florida.
   North Carolina's Mount Mitchell recorded 17 inches of snow and
other mountain areas near the Tennessee border reported between 5
and 10 inches of snow.
   The snow blocked roads in Avery County, which sits on the border.
   Up to six inches of snow covered mountain tops in northeast
Georgia and snow mixed with rain fell over central Georgia.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered across much of
Florida and rain also spread north into Virginia.
   Clouds covered parts of Southern California and the New England
coast. Skies were mostly sunny over much of the rest of the nation.
   Tuesday morning's low was 13 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34 degrees at Bluefield,
W.Va. to 91 degrees at Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.
   Scattered rain was forecast along the central Atlantic Coast for
Wednesday, with temperatures climbing into the upper 60s. Mostly
sunny or partly cloudy skies were predicted for most other regions.
   Highs in the 40s were forecast across the upper Mississippi
valley, Maine and coastal parts of New England; in the 50s from the
northern plains through the upper Great Lakes into interior New
England; in the 80s from eastern Oregon and southwest Idaho through
the California valleys, the southern Rockies and the central high
Plains into much of Texas; and in the 90s over the Southwest
deserts.
   Highs in the 60s or 70s were called for most of the rest of the
nation.

   Vice President George Bush said Tuesday he hoped
former White House aides John Poindexter and Oliver North would be
found ``innocent of any wrongdoing'' in the Iran-Contra affair.
   As to a possible pardon, Bush said he would deal with that issue
only if he is forced to face it if elected president.
   Bush made the comments in interviews with New York reporters in
a day in which he pitched the first ball in a baseball game, called
it ``warming up'' for the fall and defended his attacks against the
``ghost of Jimmy Carter.''
   Bush was asked if he would pardon then-National Security Adviser
Poindexter and then-White House aide North if elected.
   He called the question ``too hypothetical,'' but then added: ``I
hope, my own personal hope is, they're found innocent of any
wrongdoing.''
   ``If I had to face that (a pardon) at some time, then I'd keep
my own counsel and make my own decision.'' It was the first time
the vice president had expressed a desire that the two indicted
former officials be found innocent.
   Bush defended anew his refusal to disclose the advice he gave
President Reagan on the Iran-Contra matter.
   ``I've taken lots of shots (on that). But it doesn't bother me
because I know I'm doing what's right,'' Bush told his interviewers.
   On another subject, Bush told reporters that he did not think he
was too aristocratic to build wide support.
   ``If so, why would I have cleaned them (Republican rivals) up in
the primaries?'' he asked.
   ``For you to suggest that some aristocratic bias makes it
impossible for me to reach out _ just you watch,'' Bush declared.
   Bush, campaigning in New York one week before the state's
primary elections, threw out the ball for the start of a New York
Mets baseball game.
   ``We're warming up for the fall race,'' he joked, practicing by
tossing an apple aboard Air Force Two with Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y.
   The vice president continued what aides depicted as a generic
campaign against Democrats in speeches taking aim at the policies
of former President Carter.
   ``That's exactly what we'd have if we ended up electing one of
them,'' Bush told reporters at an airport news conference in
Syracuse.
   He said he saw little difference among the three Democratic
contenders, Jesse Jackson, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee _ all of whom were also in New
York, for a debate and for primary campaigning.
   Asked by reporters why we was campaigning against Carter, who
left office in 1981, Bush said: ``Because the policies of the
Democrats will take us right back to the high interest rates and
the double-digit inflation of the Carter years.''
   At a later speech at a shopping mall in Syracuse, Bush expanded
upon the theme, saying he had no problem ``running against the
ghost of Jimmy Carter.''
   ``Do you want Americans to go back to those terrible days of
malaise and darkness?'' he asked.
   Bush attended a $1,000-a-ticket fund-raising reception Tuesday
night sponsored by developer Donald Trump, who endorsed the vice
president's candidacy. ``He's a great gentleman,'' said Trump.
   Bush told the packed reception at New York's Plaza Hotel that
the Democratic contenders ``want to set the clock back'' and ``bust
the federal government.''
   Bush has already raised the $27 million allowable by federal
election law for direct campaign spending. His current fund-raising
activities are designed to raise money for accounting expenses
exempt from the limit and for party organizations.
   At a fund-raising breakfast Tuesday in Schenectady, Bush told
supporters, ``I can't wait to take on whichever one of those
Democrats win the Democratic nomination.''
   In his campaign stops in New York, Bush has focused on economic
achievements under President Reagan's administration.
   ``I want to lead the country in making good changes last, and
building on them,'' he told the Schenectady audience.
   Peter Teeley, Bush's spokesman, said it is still not clear when
Reagan will begin to give the vice president campaign assistance,
since Pat Robertson is still technically a candidate.
   ``We welcome any activity on the part of the president as
quickly as he feels it's appropriate,'' Teeley said.
   Before the Trump fund-raiser, Bush said he disagreed with
comments by Dukakis on a Palestinian state.
   ``We shouldn't have a Palestinian state,'' Bush said. ``It isn't
in the interest of the national security of the United
States...It's not good foreign policy. (But) solving the
Palestinian problem is.''

   A group of men hurled grenades at a
house in northern Mexico, dashed inside and fired submachine guns
on the four sleeping occupants, killing them, according to news
reports Tuesday.
   Men in combat fatigues later fired grenades at the house from
helicopters, the reports said.
   The Mexico City daily newspapers El Universal and Excelsior
quoted Federico Valenzuela, Sonora state judicial police director,
as saying that the slayings were related to drug trafficking.
   Valenzuela said police had no suspects in the attack Monday in
Caborca, about 60 south of the Mexico-Arizona border.
   The men in the helicopters earlier planted a bomb in front of
another house in the city, but no injuries were reported,
newspapers said.
   Sonora state judicial police in Caborca said by telephone
Tuesday that federal authorities were handling the investigation.
An operator at the federal public ministry in Caborca said all
agents and federal police officers were out of the office and
unavailable for comment.
   According to the Mexico City reports and another published
Tuesday in the daily newspaper El Norte in Monterrey, the attacks
occurred about 6:30 a.m. Monday.
   Witnesses reported that men driving a small truck and two other
vechicles stopped in front of a house in a residential
neighborhood, threw grenades at the door, then burst inside firing
submachine guns at the four sleeping occupants.
   Police later recovered the bodies of the four men.
   Men in three helicopters then launched grenades at the home,
according to the Mexico City reports.
   Other witnesses reported seeing men in camouflage clothing with
black paint on their faces descend from one of the three
helicopters to another house, according to the news reports.
   The men planted explosives at the house, then returned to the
helicopter. The bombs detonated as the helicopter flew away, El
Norte said.
   According to police, the home is owned by Miguel Angel Caro
Quintero, brother of Rafael Caro Quintero, who is jailed in Mexico
City in connection with the slaying of American drug agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar, El Norte reported.
   The house apparently was vacant at the time.

   The Williamsburg Bridge was built in 1903 for
bicycles and horse-drawn buggies, but it has had to carry a much
heavier load for most of its 85 years, and now one of America's
busiest commuter spans is falling apart.
   The culprits are decades of rust and the daily rumblings of more
than 100,000 cars and 420 subway trains that ferry commuters over
the East River between the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and the
Lower East Side of Manhattan.
   They did, at least, until Tuesday, when the city Transportation
Department closed the bridge indefinitely to all traffic. All but
four of the Williamsburg's eight traffic lanes had already been
closed this week and service suspended on the two subway lines that
cross the bridge.
   ``It was decided it would serve the interests of safety to close
the bridge until a further evaluation is made of the material
submitted to us,'' said Transportation Department spokesman Victor
Ross after a meeting of city and state engineers and officials.
   The city acted after inspectors discovered such extensive
corrosion that they feared the bridge might collapse. A team of
more than 60 inspectors is being deployed to determine the extent
of the problem.
   ``We're finding that, yes, there is corrosion, yes, the bridge
is worse than what we imagined,'' said Chuck Carlson, deputy
commissioner of the state Department of Transportation.
   What has happened to the Williamsburg is hardly unique. The
Federal Highway Administration keeps track of 271,300 bridges, and
of those, 36,000 have some kind of structural deficiency and 41,000
are considered functionally obsolete.
   The government estimates it would cost more than $50 billion to
bring all the nation's bridges up to standard.
   ``This is a real crisis in the infrastructure situation in this
country that people aren't focusing on,'' said William D. Toohey
Jr., a spokesman for the American Road and Transportation Builders
Association. ``It's a national crisis, and in New York state it's a
lot worse than in other places.''
   In New York City, decay has forced the closing of two lanes of
traffic on each of two other major bridges across the East River,
the Manhattan and the Queensboro.
   But the Williamsburg ``is certainly one of the worst bridges
that we have,'' said Foster J. Beach III, regional director of the
state Department of Transportation. ``For 80 years, the bridge
really hasn't been maintained.''
   Problems were built into the bridge. Most suspension bridges at
the time were built with galvanized steel cables; the Williamsburg
builders chose ungalvanized steel to cut costs.
   The cables were coated with oil to protect them from corrosion,
but the protection didn't last. And just at the time when the
corrosion was beginning to cause serious damage, the city became
engulfed in the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. Bridge maintenance and
inspections went by the wayside.
   Some steel strands within the cables already have snapped.
   The Williamsburg has always been the Rodney Dangerfield of New
York City bridges. It lacks the elegance of the George Washington
Bridge, the romance of the Brooklyn Bridge and the impressive span
of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
   Stout and practical, the Williamsburg ``received a great deal of
criticism for its lack of aesthetic consideration'' when it was
finished, according to engineer Nils D. Olsson, who wrote about the
bridge in the Municipal Engineers Journal.
   At the time, the Williamsburg, at 1,600 feet, was the longest
suspension bridge in the world.
   The city now must decide whether to repair the Williamsburg or
replace it. Just last month, engineering firms from around the
world presented 25 proposals for replacements. This summer, the
city is to decide.
   The cost of replacing the bridge has been estimated at $200
million to $600 million. The cost of renovating was estimated at
$250 million _ but that was before the latest damage was found.
   In the meantime, said Samuel Schwartz, the city transportation
department's chief engineer, there has been yet another unexpected
development. ``We're finding that thousands of people have returned
to walking across the bridge,'' he said.
   Ross said he did not know if pedestrians would be barred from
the bridge.

   Senate Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd
announced Tuesday he will not seek re-election to the party post he
has held for a dozen years, touching off a wide-open race to
succeed him.
   The 70-year-old West Virginian said he will run for a sixth
Senate term and, if elected and the chamber remains under
Democratic control, assume the chairmanship of the Senate
Appropriations Committee. He also would likely become Senate
president pro tempore, the post reserved for the most senior
majority member.
   ``I believe I have been fair, firm and honest, and I have done
my best,'' Byrd told his fellow Democrats. ``I hope that you agree
... I have led my party from the ambivalence of the Carter years
through the extremes of the Reagan administration ....''
   Some Democratic senators privately have criticized Byrd's
leadership style over the years, saying he looked bad on television
and did not project well when trying to present the party's
position to the nation.
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana challenged Byrd for his
position in 1976, but dropped out when it became clear he did not
have the votes to win. He criticized Byrd at that time for
appearing to be out of step with the times.
   There had been rumors that Byrd told Democratic senators in 1986
that if re-elected to the leadership post he would not seek it
again. Those rumors were never confirmed.
   Byrd told reporters he had ``absolutely no doubt'' that he could
have won again as leader had he chosen to run.
   Byrd said that as chairman of the Appropriations Committee,
which provides money for all federal programs, he would be able to
help his state of West Virginia, which he said has suffered under
the administration's economic policies.
   However, West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore criticized Byrd's
decision, saying Byrd would have more influence as majority leader
than as appropriations chairman and that the change was unlikely to
benefit his state.
   ``Moving down to the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations
Committee is very significant, and I would be hard-pressed to
suggest that West Virginians will notice any difference as a result
of the change,'' the Republican governor said in a statement.
   The majority leader of the Senate is that chamber's chief
strategist and controlling party spokesman. He sets the agenda.
   Byrd's decision drew immediate announcements from three
Democratic senators _ George Mitchell of Maine, Daniel Inouye of
Hawaii, and Johnston _ that they will seek the leadership post.
Senate Democrats will decide the issue in a party tally to be held
after next November's election.
   Several senators said there is no clear front-runner.
   ``This is Senator Byrd's day,'' said Mitchell. ``The emphasis
ought to be on his contribution.''
   Asked whether he will seek the top job, Inouye said, ``Yes, I
will,'' and added that he believes his prospects are ``very good.''
   Inouye said he did not believe lingering criticism over his
performance as chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra investigating
committee last summer would pose an obstacle to his bid. Some
Democratic senators have complained, mostly privately, that Marine
Lt. Col. Oliver L. North was permitted to steal the show.
   One senator who had been thought a possible candidate, Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., said he would not make the race.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Byrd had earned
a special place in history as ``the grand master of Senate rules
and procedure.''
   ``He is one tough ball carrier for his party,'' Dole said.
``He's a senator's senator.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said that while Byrd himself had
provided solid leadership, ``this institution will find new
leaders. There is a very competent group of people running.''
   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., said the announcement ``was not
unexpected. The likelihood of his running again seemed to fade over
the past year. The Democrats will seek a new leader now, and go on
from there.''
   Byrd's reign has been marked by his mastery of Senate rule and a
somewhat dry, if verbose, leadership style. Insider grumbling about
his leadership qualities has grown over the years.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said Byrd has been ``a very
effective leader.'' He added, however, that ``what we'll be looking
for in the leader is perhaps someone with less knowledge of the
process, but hopefully able to do it differently ... the time for
change I think is appropriate.,''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said: ``I have all the respect
for Senator Byrd over the time he has served as majority leader and
minority leader. He made this judgment for the best interests of
the nation and the Senate.''
   Since he first entered the Senate in 1958, Byrd forged a
reputation as a courtly master strategist who revered the Senate
and its history and gained power inch-by-inch by attending to his
colleagues' smallest wishes.
   Orphaned at an early age, Byrd was raised by an aunt and uncle
in the impoverished coal country of West Virginia. He graduated
first in his class in high school, but he had to work 12 years at
such jobs as gas station attendant, grocery store clerk and butcher
before he could afford to attend college.
   Byrd's prowess as a country fiddle player helped his campaign
for the state legislature in 1946, and since then he has never lost
an election.
   After three House terms, Byrd won a Senate seat, rising in party
ranks by using his posts to do legislative and personal favors.
   In 1971, Byrd called in those favors and ousted Kennedy for the
No. 2 party post of assistant leader. He became a loyal aide to
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, and succeeded him in 1976.
   With the 1980 loss of the Senate to the Republicans, Byrd lost
his position and became minority leader.
   In that role, Byrd led Democratic opposition to a highly popular
Republican president.
   But Byrd returned in triumph when the Democrats swept the 1986
elections, recapturing majority rule in the 100th Congress.

   Moslem guerrillas killed the vice
commander of the Afghan army's central corps in an attack in the
western province of Parwan, Kabul Radio said Tuesday.
   In Moscow, meanwhile, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official told a
visiting Italian government delegation that the Kremlin will remove
50,000 troops from Afghanistan during a three-month period
beginning May 15, a source said.
   The statement by First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov
appeared to be the first time an official source gave any
indication of the size of the Soviet force backing the Afghan
government.
   Official Kabul Radio said Brig. Gen. Aqa Shah was assaulted by
``extremist opposition elements'' _ a reference to the guerrillas _
in the town of Pul Mattak. He later died of his wounds, it said,
without giving a date.
   He was buried Tuesday along with several victims of a passenger
plane shot down by guerrillas on Sunday, said Kabul Radio,
monitored in Islamabad.
   Defense and Interior Ministry officials attended the funeral in
Kabul, it said. Other victims of the crash, in which 29 people were
killed, were buried in the northern province of Faryab. The
Soviet-made plane had been on a domestic flight in northern
Afghanistan.
   The radio said the guerrillas who downed the plane were ``guided
by leaders based in Peshawar,'' referring to the seven-party
guerrilla group which maintains headquarters in Pakistan.
   Under an accord to be signed Thursday in Geneva, the Soviet
Union has agreed to remove all of its soldiers from Afghanistan
within nine months of May 15, the first half of them by Aug. 15.
   The troop figure provided by Vorontsov would make the size of
the Soviet force about 100,000 soldiers. Western sources have
estimated there are 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan, but the
Soviets never have provided a figure.
   The Italian source attended the meeting but spoke on condition
he not be further identified.
   Vorontsov told the group of eight Italian lawmakers that half of
the Soviet force would leave Afghanistan within three months, and
``he mentioned 50,000 soldiers,'' the source said.
   Vorontsov did not provide any further details.
   The Italian delegation that met with Vorontsov was headed by
Christian Democrat Flaminio Piccoli, president of the Foreign
Commission of the Italian Chamber of Deputies.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and
replaced one pro-Soviet government with another. They remained to
help government forces fight anti-Communist insurgents, who have
received aid from Pakistan and the United States.

<HEAD>Athol Fugard's `The Road to Mecca' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>

   In the dry, dusty South African outback, an
elderly woman creates an outdoor sculpture garden filled with
strange and wondrous things _ camels, wise men, owls, pyramids, a
Buddha, mermaids, peacocks, even a mosque made of beer bottles.
   She calls it her ``Mecca,'' and it is the catalyst for ``The
Road to Mecca,'' Athol Fugard's astonishing and affecting new play
which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Promenade Theater.
   Fugard is the South African playwright best known for such works
as ``Blood Knot'' and ``Master Harold . . . and the boys.'' They
deal with the pervasiveness of apartheid as well as the necessity
and inevitability of seeing everything in South Africa in terms of
black and white.
   ``The Road to Mecca,'' with its three white characters, touches
on an apartheid of a different sort. It concerns an adventurous
artist named Miss Helen, at odds with and cut off from the rigid
and unyielding Afrikaners around her. It's her eccentric art work
that severs her from society.
   Miss Helen stands at the center of a battle between Marius, a
staid minister, and Elsa, an embittered, frustrated English
teacher. Marius feels Miss Helen should move to a retirement home,
while the teacher champions the woman's right to remain where she
is and create her exotic statues.
   The fight for control of Miss Helen's life and artistic spirit
takes a while to develop. Fugard doesn't rush his story. He
examines each member of this trio with sensitivity and care.
   Act 1 focuses on the two women. Their relationship is the most
interesting aspect of the play. The younger woman admires Miss
Helen's independence, her ability to pursue what she wants,
regardless of the consequences. The older woman relishes the
companionship of the young teacher whose enthusiasm she admires.
   The minister comes between them in the second act, a powerful
explosion of drama that leads to a heartfelt and hopeful
conclusion. Fugard's mastery of language is never more evident than
near the end of Act 2 when Miss Helen explains how she came back to
life after a loveless marriage ended.
   Yvonne Bryceland, who plays Miss Helen, is a revelation. The
South African-born actress originally was rejected by Actors Equity
from performing in the United States because it felt she wasn't an
actress of international stature. Her performance confirms how
wrong the union was.
   The actress, dressed in a gray gunnysack of a dress, commands
the stage with her ingratiating smile and honey-combed voice. At
first, she projects a childlike enthusiasm but the demeanor is
deceptive. Gradually, the woman's crisis of faith is revealed, and
the iron will behind her infectious laugh comes through.
   Fugard, who also directed in a careful, deliberate manner,
offers a controlled performance as the rigid clergyman. He has a
difficult task _ to portray a sympathetic antagonist who is as much
a victim as he is a villain.
   Amy Irving starts on too strong a note as the volatile teacher,
and then has nowhere to go. It's an emotional, showy role, but the
part demands more shading than the actress gives it.
   Miss Helen's Mecca is never actually seen on stage but a glimpse
of its glories is offered in designer John Lee Beatty's
approximation of the woman's living room: Her home literally
glitters with the artist's handiwork, lighted by Dennis Parichy.
   The play ends on a reaffirmation of life, a reaffirmation by the
aging artist that recognizes the darkness while celebrating the
light. With Miss Bryceland as a most entrancing free spirit, ``The
Road to Mecca'' soars above every other play in New York.

   The development of high definition TV
offers U.S. industry a chance to improve the trade imbalance for
consumer electronics products, according to a government report
released Tuesday.
   The report by the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, a Commerce Department agency, estimates the total
potential U.S. sales of high definition TV equipment at more than
$150 billion by the year 2010.
   ``The message of the report is that there is a huge amount of
money at stake and the strength of the consumer electronics
industry as well,'' said Alfred C. Sikes, head of NTIA, in
releasing the report on the final day of the four-day National
Association of Broadcasters annual convention here.
   Advanced television technology, including high definition TV,
was a hot topic at this year's convention, and most of the dozen or
so competing systems under development were demonstrated. The
technology produces clearer images with more brilliant colors on a
wider TV screen.
   Broadcasters are concerned that a Japanese lead in developing a
high definition technology could put them at a competitive
disadvantage to cable TV, video cassette recorders and satellite
distribution systems if the Japanese system, which is not
compatible with existing U.S. television sets, takes hold in the
United States.
   Sikes said he anticipates that HDTV will follow the same path as
color television sets and video cassette recorders, though he said
he could not predict how fast sales of HDTV equipment will grow.
   ``That will turn on general economic conditions, prices of
equipment and the availability of software,'' he said.
   The report, however, says that if HDTV sales grow as fast as
color receivers and VCRs, the new products would find their way
into about 1 percent of American households by 1997 and grow to
93.9 percent in 2008, when total sales of HDTV equipment would
reach $144 billion.
   The potential sales are ``immense,'' the report said, and
``substantial participation by U.S. manufacturers'' in this
developing market could help restore balance in the trade and
federal budget deficits.
   The debate over HDTV development in the United States has been
over deciding on an industry transmission standard. Sikes said he
believes a standard can be agreed upon by 1991.

   Amtrak train No. 392 left Carbondale at
mid-afternoon as usual, but when it pulled into Chicago's Union
Station about seven hours later, five people were dead after two
collisions with the locomotive, authorities said Tuesday.
   A young Southern Illinois couple and two of their children died
Monday when their car turned off a parallel road near Effingham and
crossed the track in front of the train about 90 minutes into its
run, police and Amtrak officials said.
   About 3{ hours later, a 20-year-old woman was killed when her
car skirted horizontal crossing gates and struck the train near
Kankakee, about 60 miles south of Chicago, officials said.
   ``You don't forget things like this. ... You get the shakes,''
said engineer T.B. Parker, who was operating the train when the
second crash occurred.
   None of the train's more than 50 passengers was injured, said
Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Marciniak.
   She said the two train drivers were not responsible for the
deaths. ``They were powerless to avoid the accidents, and no
disciplinary action is planned,'' she said.
   Ms. Marciniak said the Federal Railroad Administration had
contacted Amtrak operations personnel Tuesday about the accidents.
Bill Loftus, a spokesman for the agency in Washington, said he was
unaware of any investigation but that his agency might have called
to make sure no federal railroad laws had been violated.
   The victims of the first accident were identified as Cecil Ray
Chandler, 26, of La Clede; his wife, Brenda, 25; their 4-year-old
daughter, Kerry, and 3-year-old son, Carl, said state Police Sgt.
Don Boldrey.
   Parker said fireman William White, 55, was driving when the run
began. They both saw the Chandler car turn off a parallel road and
head slowly toward the track.
   Parker said he did not believe the family saw the train at the
crossing, marked with a crossing symbol but no gate or lights.
   ``I could see the female occupant of the car, and she never
looked at us. ... I thought I saw the woman holding a child.
   ``Mr. White had already applied the brakes,'' Parker said. ``He
started blowing the whistle. Then we put the brakes in emergency,
but it was too late.''
   He said the engine had been traveling about 76 mph and came to a
halt one-third of a mile down the track. Ms. Marciniak said she did
not know what the authorized speed limit was in that area but said
the train was traveling within it.
   ``There was nothing the guy could have done to stop it,'' Ms.
Marciniak said of the train's driver. She said the car exploded on
impact.
   Chandler, an unemployed saw-mill worker, and his wife had three
other children, said Ronald Pagel, owner of Pagel Funeral Home in
Edgewood.
   The train was delayed about an hour and then headed north again,
with Parker taking the controls about halfway through the 300 mile
run _ a routine switch.
   The train passed through Kankakee after dark at the maximum 79
mph when the railway men saw a car approach rapidly from the west,
Parker said.
   ``The crossing signals were working, the gates were down, and we
were blowing the whistle,'' he said.
   But the car moved into the left lane as if to bypass the gates,
Parker said. The vehicle struck the train's front wheels, causing
what he described as ``a minor jolt'' that destroyed the compact
car.
   Annette Hanshew, who lived outside Bourbonnais, died in the
crash, said Deputy Kankakee County Coroner Robert Gessner.
   Last year, Illinois ranked second in the nation with 481
accidents at rail crossings, Ms. Marciniak said, behind Texas with
625.

   Right-wing terrorists opened fire on two
police agents early Tuesday at a ranch, seriously wounding them,
police reported.
   They said officers Carlos Covilobos and Antonio del Valle were
shot by members of the extreme-right National Alert organization
and the gunmen then escaped in the agents' car.
   The shooting took place at a ranch 40 miles north of Buenos
Aires, police said.
   Police have blamed National Alert for four bombings in Buenos
Aires and Cordoba this month that injured four people. Two victims
were patrons in a movie theater and two policemen were wounded
trying to defuse a bomb.
   The Buenos Aires-based group seeks a return to military rule and
supports former Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led unsuccessful army
mutinies in January 1988 and April 1987. Rico is in the Magdalena
military prison near Buenos Aires awaiting trial on rebellion
charges.
   One of National Alert's leaders, Luis Alberto Vega, was shot to
death last week on a street in a Buenos Aires suburb. Officials
said police shot Vega, 24, after he threatened them with a grenade.
They said weapons and explosives were found in a search of Vega's
house.
   The Third Army Corps said Tuesday that two bombs exploded over
the weekend at an army compound in Cordoba but caused no injuries
or damage. It said no group or individual asserted responsibility
for the bombings.

   Moslem guerrillas killed the vice
commander of the Afghan army's central corps in an attack in the
western province of Parwan, Kabul Radio said Tuesday.
   In Moscow, meanwhile, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official told a
visiting Italian government delegation that the Kremlin will remove
50,000 troops from Afghanistan during a three-month period
beginning May 15, a source said.
   The statement by First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov
appeared to be the first time an official source gave any
indication of the size of the Soviet force backing the Afghan
government.
   Official Kabul Radio said Brig. Gen. Aqa Shah was assaulted by
``extremist opposition elements'' _ a reference to the guerrillas _
in the town of Pul Mattak. He later died of his wounds, it said,
without giving a date.
   He was buried Tuesday along with several victims of a passenger
plane shot down by guerrillas on Sunday, said Kabul Radio,
monitored in Islamabad.
   Defense and Interior Ministry officials attended the funeral in
Kabul, it said. Other victims of the crash, in which 29 people were
killed, were buried in the northern province of Faryab. The
Soviet-made plane had been on a domestic flight in northern
Afghanistan.
   The radio said the guerrillas who downed the plane were ``guided
by leaders based in Peshawar,'' referring to the seven-party
guerrilla group which maintains headquarters in Pakistan.
   Under an accord to be signed Thursday in Geneva, the Soviet
Union has agreed to remove all of its soldiers from Afghanistan
within nine months of May 15, the first half of them by Aug. 15.
   The troop figure provided by Vorontsov would make the size of
the Soviet force about 100,000 soldiers. Western sources have
estimated there are 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan, but the
Soviets never have provided a figure.
   The Italian source attended the meeting but spoke on condition

   Vorontsov told the group of eight Italian lawmakers that half of
the Soviet force would leave Afghanistan within three months, and
``he mentioned 50,000 soldiers,'' the source said.
   Vorontsov did not provide any further details.
   The Italian delegation that met with Vorontsov was headed by

Commission of the Italian Chamber of Deputies.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and
replaced one pro-Soviet government with another. They remained to
help government forces fight anti-Communist insurgents, who have
received aid from Pakistan and the United States.

   A federal judge refused Tuesday to overrule a
ban ordered by the Agriculture Department last month on the use of
padded shoes on Tennessee Walking Horses.
   U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Gasch denied breeders and
displayers of the high-gait show horses a temporary restraining
order to lay aside Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng's order
prohibiting the use of the 4-inch-thick pads on the horses' front
hooves.
   Lyng issued the order on March 25 after Gasch had ruled four
days earlier that the department's present regulations allowing use
of the pads to accent the breed's high gait violated the 1970 Horse
Protection Act.
   The 1970 law was intended to eliminate the practice of
``soring'' _ using chemicals or devices to accent a horse's gait
through the infliction of pain to the animal _ in the Tennessee
Walker industry.
   Whether the 4-inch pads, sometimes called stacks, ``sore'' or
cause pain to a horse has been a legal dispute in Gasch's court for
the past four years through a suit by the American Horse Protection
Association.
   Gasch described the pads, which effectively elevate the front of
a horse and thus shift its weight to its rear legs, as being
similar to high-heeled shoes that a women might decide to quit
wearing because they hurt her feet.
   ``The horses, however, don't seem to have a choice,'' he added.
   The Tennessee Walking Horse Breeder's Association and a new
group called Friends of the Show Horse formed in response to Lyng's
ruling had petitioned Gasch for the restraining order.
   John Harmon, an attorney for the latter group, argued that Lyng
had overstepped the judge's March 25 ruling by immediately
implementing the ban instead of going through the normal, lengthy
process of rewriting the regulations after first holding hearings
and seeking comments.
   The Agriculture Department, which had defended its present
regulations and agreed with the breeders that the pads were legal,
has started that process of redrafting them. But in the interim, it
is prohibiting the padded shoes.
   Harmon said Lyng's action caused the immediate cancellation of
11 Tennessee Walking Horse shows and threatens another 24 scheduled
between now and the end of April around the country.
   ``It's like Pearl Harbor to Shelbyville,'' said Rep. Jim Cooper,
D-Tenn., whose district includes the town that is site to the
annual Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, the industry's
largest show.
   Cooper estimated that the show held each year just prior to
Labor Day pumps about $35 million into the Shelbyville area's
economy.
   ``It's the flashy, fast-gaited horses that draw the crowds,'' he
said. ``People in the business tell me the horses without pads are
not as exciting,''
   However, Sharon Rice, who owns a small stable of Tennessee
Walkers in Fairfax, Va., said she is now showing five horses that
have never had pads put on their hooves.
   ``They don't need to use them,'' she said of the devices. ``It
just makes it easier and quicker to train them. And for people
running large farms, that means they can just run that many more
horses through.''

   Little Rock Police Chief Jess F. ``Doc''
Hale, suspended following his arrest on theft charges, died of an
apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound Tuesday, authorities said.
   Lt. Bert Jenkins said Hale's wife, Jean, found Hale, 47, shot in
the head in the laundry room of his home.
   Hale, of Cabot, was suspended as chief pending the outcome of
his trial on a charge of theft of less than $200 from a cash
register in a Little Rock drug store. He was arrested March 10
outside the store.
   Hale's trial was to begin May 24 in Pulaski County Circuit
Court. He pleaded innocent to the charge March 11 and was released
on his own recognizance.
   In a statement, Little Rock City Manager Tom Dalton said the
gunshot wound ``appears to be self-inflicted.''
   ``Our entire city is shocked and stunned as we share this
tragedy and sorrow,'' Dalton said. ``We extend our deepest sympathy
to Doc's family.''
   Hale was charged after state police made secret videotapes in
the store, which is a favorite hangout for local politicians and
police.
   Chief Deputy Larry Jones of the Lonoke County sheriff's office
said notes on several sheets from a yellow legal pad were found in
Hale's residence, but he did not know the contents.
   However, Sheriff J.O. Isaac said Tuesday night that Hale didn't
leave any note that would explain his death.
   ``There was not a note found in the vicinity of where the body
was. Any businessman or law officer keeps notes and that's what
these were,'' Isaac said of the sheets from the legal pad.
   Isaac said he expected results of an autopsy conducted late
Tuesday would be released Wednesday by the state Crime Laboratory.
The sheriff said he would not know until then whether Hale's death
was a suicide.
   He said tests were also being conducted on a pistol _ not Hale's
service revolver _ that was found near the body.
   Radio station KARN, quoting sources who insisted on anonymity,
reported late Tuesday that a settlement of the Hale case was being
negotiated. Under the settlement, KARN said, the charges against
Hale would have been dropped if the chief resigned.
   Pulaski County Prosecuting Attorney Chris Piazza declined
comment on the report, and attorneys for Hale and the store owner
could not be reached at their homes or offices Tuesday night.
   Hale was hired as chief Oct. 20, 1986, after running the
Medicaid Fraud Division of the state attorney general's office. He
had joined the attorney general after a long career with the Little
Rock Police Department.

   An 11-year-old boy was taken into welfare custody
Tuesday after he disappeared for six days, apparently with a
neighbor woman who his mother claims was infatuated with the
youngster.
   The woman allegedly involved, 37-year-old Janette Buckley, was
arrested by detectives at a house at Peterborough 75 miles north of
London on Tuesday night.
   Detectives later took her for questioning to Corby, where she
and the boy were neighbors, Northamptonshire police said in a
statement. Corby is 20 miles southwest of Peterborough.
   Mrs. Buckley, who is married and has five children, disappeared
from her home in Corby at about the same time April 6 that
schoolboy Wayne Burgess disappeared from his home a few doors away,
according to Press Association, the domestic news agency.
   Welfare workers took Wayne into their care Tuesday after he
telephoned police from Kettering, 60 miles north of London, and
then made his way about 10 miles north to the Corby police station.
   Wayne's mother, Kathleen Burgess, was quoted by the agency as
saying, ``I saw this unhealthy friendship developing over the past
year and warned Janet to stop it. ... She has taken the love and
affection of my son and I thought she was my friend.
   ``They just got too close and I warned her to leave him alone
but she wouldn't listen,'' she said.
   The agency quoted neighbors as saying Mrs. Buckley was
``completely besotted'' with the boy.

   Palestinians and Israeli troops clashed in the
occupied territories Tuesday while Arabs accused of inciting
violence fought deportation orders through the courts.
   More than two dozen Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets
or tear gas in scattered protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
army sources said.
   Palestinians in the West Bank village of Beita, where an Israeli
teen-ager was killed last week, said they feared retaliation by
Jewish settlers once the army lifts a curfew, but insisted Arabs
were not to blame for the girl's death.
   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, troops shot rubber bullets and
live ammunition to disperse a demonstration near a military
building, Palestinian reporters said.
   An army helicopter hovered above the Beach camp, also in the
Gaza Strip, firing tear gas grenades and gravel at the protesters,
Israel Radio reported. The army clamped a curfew on the Beach camp
and its 42,000 residents.
   One resident, Hassan Mahmoud Kaoud, 21, reportedly perished
Tuesday. Arab sources told the Itim news agency he died after
inhaling tear gas on Monday.
   Army sources said 10 Gaza residents suffered beating injuries,
four were hurt by rubber bullets and 10 suffered tear gas
inhalation. They said one Arab was wounded by a regular bullet.
Ahli Arab hospital officials in Gaza City identified the victim as
a 12-year-old boy and said he had a gunshot wound in his left arm.
   In the West Bank village of Asira esh Shamaliya near Nablus, two
Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops when residents
blocked the road and stoned a bus transporting soldiers, the army
reported. It said an army officer was injured when he was hit by a
rock.
   A virturally total commercial strike was observed in the West
Bank and Gaza, but many Arab workers left for work in Israel,
Israeli media reports said.
   Three of twelve Palestinians who received deportation notices on
Monday appealed the orders to a military tribunal, Israel Radio
reported. The rest said they plan to appeal.
   Eight Palestinians were deported to Lebanon Monday.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the Jewish state will
continue ``to build the kingdom of Israel'' and threatened to
deport more Palestinian activists.
   Beita's 6,000 residents are living under a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
Soldiers patrol the village, which is surrounded by thick groves of
olive, fig and almond trees.
   Troops guard the village entrance.
   The army has ordered the deportation of six residents. Hundreds
have been detained, and Beita residents said 60 were still being
held Tuesday.
   ``This is an act of retaliation against us, against the whole
village,'' said Ahmed Hassan Salman, 27. ``It is a collective
punishment to satisfy the settlers' demands. A settler killed the
girl _ and they are punishing us.''
   Villagers said no Arabs were involved in the shooting of
15-year-old Tirza Porat on April 6, but they said the army has
destroyed 16 of their homes.
   Initial army reports said the girl was stoned to death by Arabs
while hiking through Beita, 35 miles north of Jerusalem, with a
group of Jewish teen-agers and two armed guards. Enraged Jewish
settlers screamed for revenge and attacked Arab homes and cars.
   After an autopsy, the army concluded that Tirza was accidentally
shot by one of the Israeli guards.
   Tirza was the first Israeli civilian to die since unrest broke
out Dec. 8 in the occupied territories Israel seized in the 1967
Middle East war. According to U.N. figures, 143 Palestinians have
died. On Israeli soldier also was killed.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering expressed concern over Israeli
tactics in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, specifically
deportations, administrative detentions and house demolitions.
   He told an audience at Jerusalem's Hebrew University that it was
essential that basic concepts of due process be observed.
   Israel's deputy chief of staff, Gen. Ehud Barak, told Israeli
newspapers reserve soldiers would be called up for 62 days a year
instead of the usual 40 to cope with violence in the occupied
territories.
   Barak also said there were five times as many troops serving in
the occupied territories than a year ago due to recent unrest, the
Hadashot daily reported. He declined to give a figure in keeping
with military policy.

   Former White House spokesman Larry Speakes
says he attributed remarks on major foreign policy issues to
President Reagan that the president did not make, in one case
because the president himself ``had almost nothing to say.''
   Speakes, in his new book, describes two occasions on which he
attributed remarks to Reagan that he says the president never made.
   Speakes says that after a Korean Air Lines plane carrying 61
Americans was shot down in 1983, he credited statements made by
Secretary of State George Shultz to Reagan.
   And he says that during Reagan's summit meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985 he attributed to
Reagan remarks that he and an assistant press secretary, Mark
Weinberg, had manufactured.

   A decade of school reform has produced stacks of
legislation, higher teacher pay and tighter teaching requirements
but has left unresolved whether teachers are full-fledged
professionals, a report says.
   ``By sheer volume of legislation, it is clear that teaching has
been `reformed,''' said the 80-page Rand Corp. report, ``The
Evolution of Teacher Policy,'' released Monday.
   ``Teaching policy is up for grabs _ and there are lots of people

documents released Tuesday.
   The documents include a 1986 opinion from the Office of
Government Ethics which concludes that even if the group of
businessmen decided to give the $2.5 million Los Angeles estate to
the Reagans free of charge, the president probably would not be
violating any federal ethics regulations by accepting it.

   Major environmental groups and the Environmental Protection
Agency hailed the decision by members of the Foodservice & Packing
Institute as an important symbolic step in persuading others to
find substitutes for the chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, compounds.
   Consumers will notice little impact because the the decision

clamshell hamburger containers used by fast-food chains. Two-thirds
of those foams currently are made without CFCs.

<TEXT>
   Edgar and Arthur Simionescu lived the
simplest of lives in the most complex of times, quiet men in a
quiet town measuring their wealth in their devotion to each other.
   Few people noted the passing of Edgar and Arthur two years ago,
three months apart, in the brown shingled house where they spent 90
years. They outlived almost everyone who ever knew them.
   They might have faded away completely, side by side in
Hackensack Cemetery, the fragments of their lives preserved only in
bits of paper in the Bergen County Courthouse, but for the matter
of their will, Hackensack High School and a pile of money.
   That bit of paper turned the simple story of Edgar and Arthur
into Hackensack legend.
   The sons of a Romanian head waiter at a Wall Street restaurant
arrived in Hackensack in 1896. The family moved to a large frame
house on Sussex Street, not far from the site of the first
Hackensack High School, built a year later for $12,000.
   Edgar, the eldest, attended the school for a year in 1904. By
the time his brother, Arthur, entered in 1909, the brick building
was already bursting with students and plans were in the works for
a new high school.
   Arthur left two years later, and Max, the family baby, was the
only Simionescu to attend the new school completed in 1918 and the
only brother to graduate.
   Max became an accountant and married Kathleen Ryan, a girl he
met while working summers at an uncle's ice cream stand at the
Connecticut shore.
   Arthur was stricken with polio at age 17, and the paralysis left
him wheelchair-bound for the rest of his life.
   Edgar became a machinist and was drafted into the Army's horse
cavalry in World War I. He had served only a couple of months when
the war ended, and he never again ventured far from the house on
Sussex Street or from Arthur's side.
   For years, Edgar had Arthur and Arthur had his stamp collection,
and they both had Max, who always called them ``the boys'' even
though he was at least 10 years younger, and even after they were
all over 70.
   In the summer, Max and Kathleen invited the boys to their home
for picnics. Edgar was the cut-up, the extrovert, always looking
for attention. Arthur was more serious, more thoughtful.
   ``They were very close. Whatever Arthur said, Edgar went
along,'' said Matthew O'Connor, assistant vice president in the
trust department at United Jersey Bank, who came to love the
brothers like uncles. ``I never heard one raise their voice to the
other.''
   They lived contentedly, undisturbed. Every day, Edgar helped his
brother dress, eased him in and out of his wheelchair and assisted
with his stamp orders. Edgar cooked their meals as long as he was
able and maintained the house. Even into his 80s, he was fixing
things, painting or repairing this or that. He didn't believe in
bringing in outsiders.
   For years, they had a weekly poker game with another pair of
brothers, plumbers. Dealer's choice, nickel stakes.
   They never watched television. All the news worth learning was
in the newspaper, Edgar believed, and he would sit in his mother's
chair and read it aloud to Arthur, who couldn't turn the pages. Or
he'd lay the paper in front of Arthur, and turn the pages for him.
   The city shifted and grew around them; public housing projects
sprang up on the site of the Hackensack High School they had
attended, and businesses and warehouses cropped up around their
home. Their sister-in-law begged them to move, but they refused.
The more Hackensack changed, the more Edgar and Arthur stayed the
same.
   ``They were happy the way they lived,'' O'Connor said. ``To our
standards, they probably lived frugal lives; to them, they did not.
They had enough to eat, clothing, a roof over their heads. They
paid their bills.''
   Money meant little to the boys; dignity was everything. Arthur's
last wish was that Edgar, whose health and mind were deteriorating,
never be placed in a nursing home. The night Arthur died, at 90,
the men from the funeral home almost took away the sleeping Edgar.
``Not yet,'' O'Connor told them.
   On their doctor's advice, Edgar was never told of Arthur's
death, but those around him were sure he sensed it. He died three
months later, at 93.
   They had some investments, stocks and bonds purchased years ago.
Most of the certificates were so old they were handwritten, and
some of the companies no longer existed, having long since been
swallowed up by others.
   They never changed securities. That was their philosophy. But
the value of their investments changed radically in the last 10
years.
   By the time Edgar and Arthur died, their estate was worth more
than $1.5 million.
   The money was left in trust for Hackensack High School, with
direction that the $120,000 or so in annual interest be given in
college scholarships to its students, based on need. Administrators
hope to award the first batch this spring.
   ``If you or I had a million and a half, 2 million bucks, would
you not consider moving into some kind of condo, where you had the
elevators, where you had all the services, where you could have the
sunshine?'' wondered Harold Bloom, principal at Hackensack High.
``These men were not frightened men. Why did they stay? They must
have loved their community, or their home.''
   What they loved most, perhaps, was growing old in a place where
they didn't have to open the door when change came knocking, a
place where two bachelor brothers could turn quiet lives into an
eloquent gift of hope for other people's children.
   ``We're the family of the Simionescus,'' Bloom said. ``In
perpetuity. For generations. That's a nice memorial, isn't it?''

   The lighting is soft, the food and wine
exquisite, the conversation witty and sophisticated _ ingredients
for a perfect evening.
   But the men and women at the elegant restaurant are more
interested in salmon mousse than sizzling amour. Dalliance, though
welcome, is not the goal of The Single Gourmet _ a less romantic
but frequently more satisfying pleasure lies behind the
organization with about 10,000 members in North America.
   ``It's probably the best way to meet people,'' said Art Fischer,
who began the club in New York in 1982. ``It's not a dating agency.
It's not a matrimonial agency. It's a dining club. We try to bring
people together for good food and congenial conversation.''
   The organization's recipe, stirred by changes in courtship and
fascination with the arts of the kitchen, has been successful. The
New York branch has grown to 2,600 members, and 14 independent
chapters have opened in the United States and Canada, Fischer said
in a telephone interview.
   Members pay up to $75 a year to join The Single Gourmet and
$25-50, not including wine, for meals at restaurants or on other
outings. Most are upper-middle-class professionals _ lawyers,
business executives, stockbrokers and doctors, Fischer said.
   In keeping with the classy, low-key approach, members are not
afflicted with name tags, but are identified discreetly at tables
of six to 10 with placecards bearing only first names.
   In San Francisco, about 35 members of The Single Gourmet
recently enjoyed salmon tortellini, pear and parsnip soup, lamb
with couscous and other specialities of California cuisine at Cafe
Majestic, a popular restaurant in a restored Victorian hotel.
   ``I've wanted to come to this restaurant ever since it opened,
but I never dared come by myself,'' said Jenny, 49, a medical
secretary. ``So this is a real option for me.''
   The chapter, about 18 months old, has about 270 members in the
Bay area. One member travels from Nevada to attend its dinners,
winery tours and other functions, which occur about twice a month.
   Some regulars simply find The Single Gourmet a way to fit a
social life into their busy schedules.
   ``It forces you to go out. For instance, I would not on a
Tuesday night go out to Cafe Majestic or someplace like it,'' said
Louis Sclafani, a designer in his 30s.
   ``It gives you a nice experience trying different restaurants
and lets you experiment without, as a single man, having to go out
on a date,'' he said.
   Others, like Gary Sternitzke, first used the club as a way to
learn about good restaurants and find friends in a new city. He was
hooked when he ended up belly dancing at a Moroccan restaurant at
the first Single Gourmet dinner he attended a year and a half ago.
   Sternitzke, 35, credits the club for introducing him _ a native
of the Midwest raised on ``meat-and-potatoes stuff'' _ to culinary
adventure.
   ``I've tasted food I can't even say,'' he said. ``And I've tried
food when I've asked them not to tell me what it is until I've
eaten it.''
   But all the diners agreed they hadn't joined The Single Gourmet
as a singles club or dating service.
   ``I just enjoy meeting people. If it was single and married
people, I'd probably join then, too,'' said Jeanne Swift, who began
attending dinners six months ago.
   Jenny, who declined to give her last name, said sex wasn't a
factor in the civilized pleasure of enjoying food with others.
   ``When you're eating lovely food, you want to look across the
table and say, `This is wonderful; you must have a taste,''' she
said. ``I don't care if it's with men or women.''
   But changing sexual behavior has definitely helped The Single
Gourmet, members and coordinators said.
   ``It just seemed like an idea that came at the right time,''
Fischer said. ``It was the time (the novel and movie) `Looking for
Mr. Goodbar' was giving singles bars and discos a bad name. ... You
almost had to make up your mind about someone on eye contact.
That's hardly the way to get to know somebody.''
   But while people may not be looking for love when they join,
sometimes they find it anyway. The New York chapter has seen 28
marriages of club members in six years, Fischer said.
   Fischer, a retired film importer, owns The Single Gourmet name
and sells licenses for branches, which operate independently
although members may attend dinners and other Single Gourmet events
in other cities.

<HEAD>As Bishops Begin Periodic Visits, Rome Seems Mellow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. bishops making obligatory treks to Rome are
finding that Pope John Paul II is happier with their church than
some had supposed.
   Nevertheless, their representatives have been summoned for a
special meeting next year with him about the whole situation.
   Indications had arisen in several recent diciplinary cases of
strains between the Vatican and this country's Catholicism,
including John Paul's rebuke to dissent on his visit last year.
   But as the bishops began their once-every-five years ``ad
limina'' visits, the pope was said to seem highly upbeat about the
state of the American church.
   He ``seems to have a very strong, postitive estimate of the
church in the United States since his trip,'' says Archbishop John
May of St. Louis, president of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops.
   ``I got the impression he was a little irked by people who had
filled him with all kinds of warnings and apprehensions,'' May said.
   He said the bishops welcome a special meeting with the pope next
year, an unusual summit session John Paul announced last month to
21 Midwestern bishops at the close of their group's visit.
   They were the first a series of such callers to continue through
October in which all the U.S. bishops, in rotation, visit the pope.
   In interviews with the initial returning group from Kansas,
Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska, the National Catholic Reporter said
they were elated by the ``open and warm atmosphere'' of the
meetings.
   ``Several said they were apprehensive going in but left with a
far greater sense that the pontiff supports the thrust and
direction of U.S. Catholicism,'' the paper summarized.
   They ``said the pope left them with the distinct impression he
thought he had been ill-served by some in Rome who had painted a
dire image of Catholic life in the United States...
   ``To the contrary, John Paul said he found an energetic and
faithful church ... committed to serving the needs of the poor.''
   His announcement of the 1989 meeting came as no surprise, as it
had been suggested by U.S. bishops last spring.
   At the time, various concerns about relations with the Vatican
had been brewing, including its ouster of a Washington, D.C.,
theologian, the Rev. Charles Curran, and restrictions, later
lifted, on Seattle Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen.
   Those issues have quieted, however, and May said the summit
meeting was not focused on any crisis in the church, as have been
some such sessions with bishops in Brazil and Holland.
   He said the pope never mentioned the rift that has developed
among U.S. bishops over a statement issued in December by their
50-member administrative board on AIDs, but that it was discussed
with Vatican doctrinal officials.
   They expressed ``concern about the apparent disagreement'' among
bishops about the document, he said. The document emphasized
pre-marital chastity and fidelity in marriage, but some bishops
objected to its tolerating information about condoms in public
education about AIDs.
   Meanwhile, with the number of active U.S. cardinals down to
three, speculation rose that the pope may soon appoint new ones in
this country and elsewhere. Worldwide, there are only 98 cadinals
younger than 80, the maximum age for eligibility to vote for a
pope, while the minimum number set for that task is 120.
   Among the leading prospects for ``red hats'' in this country are
Archbishops James Hickey of Washington, D.C., Roger Mahoney of Los
Angeles, Edmund Szoka of Detroit and May.
   However, retired cardinals still are living in Detroit, St.
Louis and Los Angeles, and the usual custom is not to name another
in their sees in their lifetimes.
   Philadelphia also has a retired cardinal, John Krol, but he
stepped down only last year, and his replacement, Archbishop
Anthony J. Bevilacqua, is likely considered too new on the job for
elevation now.
   Other possibilities are Minneapolis Archbishop John R. Roach and
Baltimore Archbishop William D. Borders, although their progressive
leanings may be against them, and Archbishop Patrick Flores of San
Antonio.

   Over the ages, storytellers have bridged
generational and geographical boundaries by retelling folk tales,
usually invoking some magic of their own to highlight their talents
and suit the audience.
   Continuing the tradition in the TV age is Jim Henson, creator of
``Fraggle Rock,'' ``The Muppet Show'' and Kermit the Frog and Big
Bird on ``Sesame Street.''
   Borrowing a monster here, blending in a few fairy tales there,
Henson has been delighting even the crustiest of curmudgeons with
``The Storyteller,'' a series of half-hour specials on NBC. The
fourth installment, ``The Luck Child,'' airs Saturday.
   For ``The Luck Child,'' Henson has borrowed a griffin from the
brothers Grimm and blended elements of some early Russian folk
tales. The show's magic is seamless thanks to the witty script by
British playwright Anthony Minghella, and, of course, the Muppet
mutations.
   The 14-foot-tall talking griffin (a thinking man's Big Bird _ it
claims to be misunderstood) is one of the biggest bunches of wood,
wire and widgets ever created in the London-based Muppet ``creature
shop.'' With some high tech and human help, the people-eating,
havoc-wreaking beast is brought to life by Henson's 24-year-old
son, Brian.
   ``Performing the griffin on a small platform inside its neck,
throwing my body out at different angles was sort of like being in
an aerobics class,'' said Brian Henson.
   On a smaller scale, he also ``performs'' the storyteller's
talking dog with an assistant, a tiny TV monitor, a computer and 13
thimble-size motors controlling the dog's facial movements. He says
the dog, a stylized blend of breeds, ``has a hard edge, intended to
play against the lecturing style of the narrator,'' played by
British actor John Hurt in the title role.
   ``The Luck Child'' borrows elements from ``The Lucky Child'' and
``Marco the Rich and Vasily the Luckless'' in a collection by
Alexander Afanasev. A Russian ethnographer and lawyer, he published
more than 600 native folk tales in the mid-1800s, becoming the
Russian counterpart to the brothers Grimm of Germany.
   ``The Luck Child'' also contains elements of Grimm's ``The
Griffin'' and ``The Devil with Three Golden Hairs.'' A peasant
child is born and, according to a prophecy, he will one day rule
the land, whose current leader tries to do away with him. But the
luck child survives, after tricking the griffin.
   The sponsors hope viewers will look for more stories like ``The
Luck Child'' in books. One of the show's sponsors, Clorox, also is
a sponsor of the national, non-profit literacy organization,
Reading Is Fundamental, which has distributed 78 million books to
children since 1966. It's a rare event: a prime-time network
sponsor hoping you'll read more books!
   One such book could be ``Folk Tales of the Amur'' (Abrams),
which includes 31 stories from the Russian far east. Another is
Afanasev's collection, ``Russian Fairy Tales'' (Random House).
   The Afanasev book is a standard, according to Alex Alexander,
head of the Slavic Department at Hunter College in New York and an
expert on Russian folklore. It includes Russian versions of
universal fairy-tale figures as well as the Firebird, the witch
Baba Yaga and Ivan the Terrible.
   Ironically, Russian tales like these apparently first appeared
in written form, not in their homeland in their native tongue, but
in England in the 1600s after being brought out and translated by
foreign travelers. This was mainly because Russian written
literature was almost entirely based on church teachings and folk
tales were passed by word of mouth.
   The tradition of borrowing and retelling to suit different
nations and storytellers continued when authors such as Gogol,
Dostoevski and Tolstoy, incorporated folklore into their works.
   For example, although Pushkin knew Russian folk tales and
recorded them, he wrote story poems based for the most part on
French translations of the Arabian Nights, Grimm or Washington
Irving. Pushkin's ``Tale of the Golden Cockerel'' is simply a
retelling of Irving's ``Legend of the Arabian Astrologer.'' Yet
Russian and American readers think it's Russian folklore.

   Israel turns 40 this week, beset by a rebellion
among Palestinians who have spent more than half that time under
occupation and a wrenching debate on the young nation's future.
   The Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has
drained much of the joy from a year-long birthday celebration that
climaxes April 22, which coincides on the the Hebrew calendar this
year with May 14, 1948, the date Israel was founded.
   A poetry festival and a $10 million rock music extravaganza in
the Negev Desert are going ahead but plans to bring singer Barbra
Streisand, tennis star Chris Evert and the rock group Pink Floyd
collapsed.
   Officials had hoped to demonstrate Israel's achievements and
acceptance during the anniversary year. Instead, canceled plans and
the absence of foreign heads of state underline its vulnerability.
   Much of Israel's success has been in developing military power,
the result of five wars with neighboring Arab states. For example,
it ranks sixth in the world in arms exports, which bring in about
$1 billion a year.
   There also is a flourishing cultural life, especially in a range
of music from Hebrew punk-rock to that great national cultural
achievement, the Israeli Philharmonic.
   Since Dec. 8, when the violence began, Israel has been consumed
by the question of what to do with the territories captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. For the first time
the issue is likely to be the focus of elections, now scheduled for
November.
   Liberal politicians say 20 years of occupation has had a
corrosive effect on morality and does not square with being a
``light unto nations'' the goal declared by Israel's first prime
minister, the late David Ben-Gurion.
   Abba Eban, elder statesman of the Labor Party, said growth of
character has not matched the country's growth in material wealth
and military power.
   ``We anticipated that within a period of 40 years we would have
outlived the rhetoric of struggle and resistance and would be
moving into some kind of drama and romance in social creativity,''
the former foreign minister said.
   ``Modern Israel does not owe the same allegiance, debt or
devotion to its traditional Jewish character, and it very rarely
compares its actions to criteria that come from the Jewish ethical
tradition.''
   He said democracy was being undermined by the emergency measures
of occupation, and the cooperative spirit of pioneer days was being
supplanted by materialism.
   Such misgivings are not shared by the rising star of the
conservative Likud bloc, Benyamin Netanyahu, who recently resigned
as ambassador to the United Nations. He said Israel's success
``borders on the miraculous.''
   Half a century ago, Netanyahu said, the Jewish people had
crawled from the Holocaust and the possibility of building a
national life seemed hopelessly remote.
   ``Yet in a few years the Jews recovered their homeland, fought
off armies that assaulted them, liberated their ancient capital,
built a modern economy, theaters, universities and concert halls,
and revived an ancient tongue,'' he declared.
   Netanyahu, whose brother Yonathan was killed leading the daring
1976 rescue of hijacked airline hostages at Entebbe, Uganda, said
the Arab threat is undiminished.
   ``The grim truth remains that the majority of the Arab world
still refuses to accept Israel's right to exist, and still seeks to
wage war against it, war by different means, including the present
means of mass violence and media stampede,'' Netanyahu said.
   In the former ambassador's view, withdrawal from the occupied
lands would shrink Israel's waist to a 10-mile-wide strip against
the sea, with thousands of young Palestinians holding rockets
instead of stones.
   The left believes Israel is strong and secure enough to risk
trading land for peace and that greater danger lies in keeping the
occupied territories and trying to rule the hostile and rapidly
growing popuatlion of 1.5 million Arabs.
   Palestinian intellectuals attribute the sudden explosion of
anger and violence Dec. 8 to three factors:
   _The Palestinian question was ignored by the U.S.-Soviet summit
last December and given secondary priority to the Iran-Iraq war at
the Arab summit in November
   _Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed satisfaction with the
status quo and a desire to make the occupied land a permanent part
of ``Greater Israel.''
   _Daily frustrations about army rule radicalized younger Arabs.
   A generation of Palestinians has been born and grown to
adulthood since 1967, resentful of occupation and less intimidated
by the might of the Israeli military. Many also have been attracted
to the Moslem fundamentalism spreading through the Arab world
   One result of these forces has been a young, underground
leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization that has taken
charge of the rebellion and is directing it.
   Saeb Erakat, a political science professor at An Najah
University in the West Bank, said: ``The uprising is a message to
the Israelis, the Americans and the Arabs: We don't want to become
Israeli. We are not a minority, but a people, and therefore we
demand our right to self-determination,''
   Many Israelis say the Arabs fail to comprehend or accept the
historical connection Jews feel to the land.
   Yehuda Avni immigrated from Chicago in 1949 and built the Vered
Hagalil ranch near the Sea of Galilee with his wife Yona. Across
the road from his stable of pure-bred Arabian horses is the ruin of
the home of an Israelite who lived about 200 B.C.
   ``We both picked this site with its beautiful view for our
farms,'' said Avni, 60. ``I feel a kind of kinship with him. I feel
I am part of a chain. The sense of continuity is something vivid,
and it gives depth to my life.''
   In Efrat, a Jewish settlement eight miles south of Jerusalem,
Rabbi Shlomo Riskin showed a reporter the rocky hills on which he
has founded a community of 300, mostly religious Jews.
   Seeking to dispel the image of settler as fanatic, Riskin
stresses his desire for coexistence with Arabs.
   The difficulty of achieving it is illustrated by his experience
with Majid, a Palestinian handyman who taught Riskin Arabic.
   ``I studied with him a few times a week,'' the rabbi said. ``He
had gefilte fish at my home on Friday evening a number of times. We
had what I thought were very good relations.''
   Then one day a bomb was planted just outside Efrat and one of
the prime suspects was Majid, who disappeared.
   ``I teach my children and myself to respect every human being as
innocent until proven guilty,'' Riskin said. ``At the same time, I
have to make sure that I protect myself.''
   The Arab-Israeli conflict touches almost every aspect of life,
even the 110-piece Israel Philharmonic.
   Ely Eban, 38, a clarinetist and son of Abba Eban, said the
unseen impact was brought home to him when he returned from
studying in the United States. In Israel, the tempo of life was
rapid.
   ``Whenever I would hear myself playing something here, it always
seemed a little fast, a little strident, a little more nervous,''
he said. ``When you live here, there is this rhythm that you take
on, and it does affect the music making.''

   Palestinians say a feeling they have been
neglected by the world and other Arabs, tough statements from
Israel and day-by-day frustrations of occupation led to the
rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The spark was a traffic accident Dec. 8 in which an Israeli army
truck killed four Arabs near the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza
Strip.
   Tensions were such that Arabs saw it not as an accident but as
revenge for the stabbing death in Gaza City two days earlier of
Shlomo Sakel, an Israeli businessman.
   Anger had been building among Palestinians because they felt
abandoned by Arab nations and the world community. The Arab summit
at Amman, Jordan, in November, and the U.S.-Soviet summit in
Washington in December, did not give priority to the Palestinian
issue.
   ``It was clear to us that we had been put on the shelf,'' said
Saeb Erakat, a political science professor at An Najah University
in the West Bank.
   ``The message (of the uprising) is that we don't wish to become
Israelis. We are not a mere community or a minority living in
greater Israel. We are a people ... and we demand our liberty and
our right to self-determination.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rubbed salt in the wound by noting
publicly that the Arab summit put the Iran-Iraq war ahead of the
Palestinian issue.
   He and other right-wing leaders suggested the status quo could
continue indefinitely and Israel had a right to keep the lands it
captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   This deepened the bitterness. Palestinian statements became
extreme in rejecting negotiations for a peaceful settlement.
   An example of the harder line could be found in the poetry of
Mahmoud Darwish, an Israeli Arab living in Paris who had favored
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   Many saw his poem ``Those Who Pass Between Fleeting Words'' as a
demand for all of Israel, not just the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   About the Israelis, it says:
   ``O those who pass between fleeting words,
   ``Carry your names, and be gone;
   ``Rid our time of your hours, and be gone;
   ``Steal what you will from the blueness of the sea and the sand
of memory.''
   Sari Nusseibeh, a Palestinian intellectual who advocates a
negotiated settlement, said many want all Israel included in a
Palestinian state just as some Israelis want all the land for the
Jewish state.
   ``The question is whether both sides are ready to settle for
less than what they want,'' he said. ``Are they prepared to settle
for some kind of partition of this land?''
   He said most Palestinians are ready for a two-state solution,
but this feeling is ``like a comet that comes close to the earth.
If one wants to use it, one has to grab it while it is there.''
   He also cited the cumulative affects of 20 years of occupation
on the new generation, noting that half the people of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip are under 20 years old and 77 percent under 28.
   For them, he said, leadership status is ``determined by how many
times you have been in jail, how bad was the interrogation and has
anybody in your family died fighting.
   ``The more `yeses' to such questions the more of a leader you
became within your neighborhood or community,'' he added.
   As Palestinian militancy grew, the deterrent power of Israel's
army was weakened.
   Palestinians saw Shiite Moslem guerrillas drive the Israelis out
of south Lebanon in 1985 with a determined guerrilla campaign.
   Then, in late November 1987, a Palestinian guerrilla sailed over
Israel's well-defended northern border with a hang glider and
killed six soldiers. Israeli analysts said the attack encouraged
Palestinians to challenge the army in the occupied territories.

   Oil prices have leaped to the highest level of
the year, partly reflecting speculation that OPEC would be able to
recruit help from outside producers to constrict world supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May-delivery contract
for West Texas Intermediate crude oil jumped $1.01 per barrel on
Monday to $17.89, the highest level since a closing of $17.85
reached Jan. 5. It was one of the biggest one-day moves ever,
traders said.
   Some traders and analysts said the gain was not sustainable. But
others said it signaled a more fundamental change in market
sentiment that indicated the end of a low-price era in the

his decision to set $2.475 billion in compensation for Dalkon

complacency, poor planning and a lack of contact with the business
world.
   But the 372-page report, released Monday at a national

corporate officials who said the report didn't go far enough in
addressing social and ethical issues, including minority

   The report chided schools for preaching long-term planning in

   Oil futures prices have soared to their highest
level so far this year, with the runup stirring inflation fears
that pushed interest rates sharply higher in the credit markets.
   Traders said oil prices rose Monday partly on speculation that
OPEC would encourage other oil producers to rein in production.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price
monitoring committee, which met over the weekend, said it would
meet soon with non-OPEC exporters to consider shared production
restraints.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May-delivery contract
for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude oil, jumped $1.01
per barrel to close at $17.89, its highest level this year.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating
oil rose 2.42 cents a gallon to 47.88 cents, and wholesale unleaded
gasoline rose 2.18 cents a gallon to 50.95 cents.
   Oil market experts debated whether the gain was sustainable.
Some believe the jump in prices may be signaling an end to the
recent low-price era in the petroleum business.
   The sharp run-up had a negative impact on the credit markets,
where the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose to
8.77 percent from 8.68 percent late Friday.
   The stock market edged slightly higher, extending last week's
rally despite some resistance from sellers. The Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials rose 5.80 to 2,095.99 on top of last week's
102.13-point jump to new closing highs since the crash last fall.
   The dollar rose against most major currencies except the
Canadian dollar, while gold prices were mixed.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Hanover Agrees to Sell Consumer Finance Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturers Hanover Corp. says it will retain
major consumer banking operations even after the proposed sale of
its consumer finance unit to a Texas company for $685 million cash.
   Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's sixth-largest bank holding
company, said Monday it had agreed in principle to sell the finance
unit to American General Corp., a financial services concern.
   The acquisition, if approved by the boards of both companies,
would nearly double the size of Houston-based American General's
consumer credit finance operations.
   The transaction also is subject to a definitive agreement being
reached.
   Although the proposed sale would remove one of its major
consumer operations, Manufacturers Hanover said it would remain a
strong player in the consumer market through its Branch Banking
Division, a New York area regional bank, and its nationwide credit
card operation.
   Manufacturers Hanover's decision to sell its consumer finance
unit, which is based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., came as no surprise
as it tries to recover from heavy losses absorbed last year when it
boosted its loan loss reserve.
   The bank holding company posted a $1.14 billion loss in 1987 as
it boosted its loan-loss reserve by $1.7 billion in anticipation of
problems with some of its Third World loans.
   Manufacturers Hanover expected a pre-tax gain of about $300
million from the proposed sale.
   ``We are realizing a substantial premium over book value on this
well-managed company,'' said John F. McGillicuddy, chairman and
chief executive of Manufacturers Hanover.
   Manufacturers Hanover's common stock rose 12{ cents to $26 a
share and American General was off 50 cents a share to $32.50 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   American General would make the acquisition through its
Credithrift Financial Corp., based in Evansville, Ind.
   The purchase would boost Credithrift's assets to more than $6
billion from $3.3 billion and give it a total of 1,400 branch
offices in 42 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   Both Credithrift and Manufacturers Hanover Consumer Services
market consumer and home equity loans and retail financing
services, and have insurance subsidiaries that provide
credit-related coverage.
   Lawrence Cohn, who follows the banking business for Merrill
Lynch & Co., said Manufacturers Hanover appeared to have gotten a
good price for the unit and that the sale should not hurt its
overall profitability.
   Manufacturers Hanover said the consumer finance unit earned
$55.2 million in 1987. Cohn said the company should be able to earn
that much in interest on proceeds from the sale.
   Cohn also said the sale will help Manufacturers Hanover toward
its goal of boosting the ratio between shareholder's equity and its
assets, a key indicator monitored by federal regulators.
   Manufacturers Hanover had told shareholders earlier this year
that it intended to boost that ratio to 4 percent by the end of
1988 through a combination of stronger operating earnings, $400
million in pre-tax gains on the sale of undervalued assets and use
of tax benefits.
   Manufacturers Hanover said the consumer finance sale would add
about $275 million to shareholders' equity and reduce total assets
by about $3 billion from $73.3 billion at the end of 1987.
   Cohn figured the sale would boost the equity-to-assets ratio to
about 3.32 percent from 2.81 percent at the end of 1987.
   American General posted a profit of $555 million in 1987 and had
$28 billion in assets. Its Credithrift subsidiary earned $68.9
million in 1987.
   Harold S. Hook, chairman and chief executive of American
General, said the purchase should not dilute American General's
earnings and there were no plans to alter the company's previously
announced stock repurchase plan.
   American General said it would change the name of its consumer
credit segment to American General Financial Services upon
completion of the deal.
   In addition to purchase price, Manufacturers Hanover said it
also would receive a cash dividend of $20 million representing the
consumer finance unit's earnings between Jan. 1 and the closing of
the transaction.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in the government's latest auction, with
rates on three-month bills unchanged and rates on six-month bills
edged down slightly.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 5.98 percent on Monday, the same as
last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.19 percent, down from 6.21 percent last
week.
   The three-month bill rate this week and last was the highest
since these bills averaged 6 percent on Dec. 14. The 6.19 percent
rate for six-month bills was the lowest since 6 percent on March 28.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.16 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,848.80 and 6.48 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,687.10.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, was 7.01
percent last week, up from 6.78 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Bidding Continues Escalating For Stevens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.P. Stevens & Co. remains the hub of a frenzied
bidding contest, with rival suitors Odyssey Partners and West
Point-Pepperell Inc. each sweetening their buyout offers a third
time for the textile giant.
   Odyssey ended the latest round in the lengthy auction late
Monday by raising to $1.22 billion, or $68.50 a share, the price it
is willing to pay under its March 29 agreement to acquire Stevens.
   The sweetened offer by the investment firm came hours after
Pepperell had raised its cash tender offer for New York-based
Stevens to $1.19 billion, or $67 a share for each of Stevens' 17.8
million common shares outstanding.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens stock rose 50
cents a share to close at $66.50, indicating speculators were
unsure that the heated bidding would move much higher.
   Odyssey's latest bid, which topped its previous $64-a-share
offer, worth about $1.14 billion, will expire at midnight EDT April
22 unless extended.
   In addition to sweetening its rival bid, Pepperell said it
removed major antitrust concerns about its proposal by agreeing
with the Federal Trade Commission to sell certain Stevens assets if
its offer succeeds.
   Analysts had predicted further bidding in the battle for
Stevens, a leading maker of home textiles such as sheets and
towels. But they said the bidding was reaching the upper limits of
a reasonable price for the 175-year-old company.
   ``Based on my expectations for Stevens' cash flow this year, and
assuming some overhead...and capital spending could be cut some, it
supports a bid of $65 a share and not significantly above that,''
said Deborah Bronston, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Co.
   Joseph L. Lanier Jr., Pepperell's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in an interview that he considered $1.19 billion a
fair price. But he said the company would have to ``consider our
options'' if Odyssey increased its bid.
   Pepperell had no comment late Monday on whether it would
initiate yet another round of bidding. The company's offer, which
is not conditioned on financing, expires at midnight EDT April 22.
   Odyssey had charged that a Pepperell-Stevens merger would
violate antitrust laws. But Pepperell said it reached agreement
with the FTC on Friday over divestitures to ease those concerns.
   The FTC would permit Pepperell's previously announced plans to
sell half of Stevens' bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines
for about $170 million to NTC Group, parent of the textile
manufacturer Bibb Co., Pepperell said.
   The FTC also waived waiting requirements under federal
disclosure laws but might require Pepperell to sell a sheeting
mill, a yarn plant, certain designer licenses and a brand name if
the deal was consummated, Pepperell stated.
   The FTC has six months to decide whether Pepperell must divest
those Stevens assets.
   Prudential-Bache's Bronston said the sheeting mill generates
annual sales of between $30 million to $40 million, while the yarn
plant is relatively small.
   Among the designer licenses the FTC has identified as potential
problems are Ralph Lauren, Gloria Vanderbilt, Eileen West and Perry
Ellis, Bronston said.
   Pepperell's Lanier said that while he would prefer not to sell
those assets, ``it would have no significant impact if we had to.''
   Bronston said that given its situation, Pepperell might be
forced to sell the licenses at prices lower than what the company
paid for them.
   Stevens also has licenses for the designers Laura Ashley, Pierre
Cardin and Givenchy, among others. Pepperell's brands include
Arrow, Martex, Lady Pepperell and Burberry.
   Bidding for Stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout
offer earlier this year from a group led by its own senior
management, including Chairman Whitney Stevens, a fifth-generation
member of the family that founded the company in 1813.
   Pepperell, which is based in West Point, Ga., launched a
$62.50-a-share tender offer last month after Stevens agreed to a
buyout by Odyssey at $61.50 a share.
   Odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to $64, and announced
last week that it had commitments in place to finance the $1.14
billion bid.
   Under terms of its agreement with Odyssey, Stevens board said it
would pay the firm up to $8 million if the textile company was
acquired by a third party for more than $64 a share.

<HEAD>Iowa Attorney General Sues Credit Card Giant Over Consumer Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit seeking to force Citibank to
obey Iowa consumer credit laws potentially could affect other
companies that, like Citibank, offer credit cards in Iowa but base
their card operations elsewhere, the state's attorney general says.
   Attorney General Tom Miller filed a federal lawsuit Monday
seeking to sto Citibank, the nation's biggest credit card issuer,
from applying the less stringent credit laws of South Dakota, where
its credit card operation is based, to other states.
   The suit contended that although the courts consistently have
allowed credit card issuers to use the laws of their home state in
setting interest rates wherever they operate, that power should not
apply to other consumer credit issues.
   ``We are challenging the assumption that they can export the
laws of states which have few consumer protections into states like
Iowa that have stronger protections for their citizens,'' Miller
said at a news conference announcing the suit.
   ``The suit could affect every bank that has a national credit
card operation,'' he said.
   Miller said other states had indicated interest in joining the
action.
   Citibank's Sioux Falls, S.D. office referred reporters' calls to
its New York headquarters. Spokesman Bill McQuire in New York said
that while the company had not seen the suit, it did comply with
federal law.
   Citibank is the banking subsidiary of the New York-based
Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company. It is accused
of collecting late charges and other fees that are allowed under
South Dakota law but are banned in Iowa.
   The company has issued about 15 million credit cards nationwide
but insists that South Dakota's consumer laws govern its cards
wherever they are issued. There are 36,000 Citibank MasterCard and
Visa cards issued in Iowa.
   Miller said although Iowa has deregulated credit card interest
rates, it also has banned late payment fees and insufficient funds
check charges. Iowa also requires companies give three months
notice before changing the terms of a credit card contract.
   ``The banks argue that Iowa law doesn't apply in this
situation,'' Miller said. ``We say our (state) law does protect
Iowans.''
   Miller also said the South Dakota law gave Citibank a
competitive advantage over Iowa-based issuers who had to follow
their state's stricter credit rules.
   Miller's suit seeks a ban on collection of the late payment
fees, plus unspecified civil penalties and a refund of any payments
which have been collected.
   The state targeted Citibank for the suit because it is the
biggest card issuer, although other companies may be sued as well,
Miller said. The state failed to reach an out-of-court settlement
over the issue with Citibank, he said.
   The nation's top 10 credit card companies have about 64 million
cards outstanding, representing accounts of more than $32 billion.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French industrial group is offering
$75.9 million to acquire Wolverine Technologies Inc., a maker of
vinyl siding and vinyl windows for the home remodeling industry.
   The $23 a share offer made Monday by SG Acquisition Corp., a
subsidiary of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, topped an earlier
$18.50-a-share merger agreement Wolverine had with Ply-Gem
Industries Inc.
   Wolverine stock jumped $4.87{ to $23.25 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The Saint-Gobain offer, which expires May 6, was conditioned at
least 2.1 million of Wolverine's 3.3 million outstanding shares
being tendered, said Toney File, a Saint-Gobain spokesman in New
York.
   Although Wolverine had agreed to be acquired by Ply-Gem, its
board of directors will consider the new offer, said Thomas
Jeffers, Wolverine's treasurer and vice president for finance. A
board meeting has not been scheduled.
   ``We really need to find out more about it,'' Jeffers said.
``The cash price is certainly a more attractive offer as far as the
shareholders are concerned.''
   The Ply-Gem agreement prohibited Wolverine from soliciting other
offers but not from considering an offer, Jeffers said.
   Wolverine reported 1987 earnings of $8.4 million on revenue of
$111 million.
   Saint-Gobain has more than 300 plants and 140,000 employees in
17 countries. It owns 94.2 percent of the stock in CertainTeed
Corp. in the United States following a tender offer that expired
last week.
   Saint-Gobain manufactures industrial products including flat
glass, insulation, containers, fiber reinforcement, industrial
ceramics, pipe and machinery, and includes a contracting and
services unit.
   The Saint-Gobain Group had 1987 net income of about $515.7
million on consolidated net sales of $14.43 billion.

   The motor oil refining company had no other comment about the

   Ardshiel offered $26.50 per share to acquire the company, which
sells Quaker State motor oil, owns Quaker State Minit-Lube Inc.
drive-in automobile lubrication centers, and manufactures truck
lighting systems and automobile brake lights.
   Ardshiel said it currently owns 3.3 percent interest in Quaker

   Quaker State employs about 6,300 people, including about 450 at

   Secret contract talks between Eastern Airlines and
its pilots union to reach a labor agreement before a possible
Machinists' strike have broken off, according to company and union
officials.
   The talks, which were kept secret by ``a gentleman's agreement
of confidentiality,'' lasted ``a couple of months,'' said union
spokesman Ron Cole.
   They ended April 1, according to an April 8 letter from the
airline, that warned pilots a settlement with the company is the
``least preferred alternative'' of union leaders.
   Facing a possible Machinists' strike, Eastern has been seeking
to guarantee pilot stability and cooperation.
   ``It made sense to reach an agreement now ... than start all
over again with the pilots after the (Machinists) negotiations. The
time was right to reach an agreement because the company needed the
pilots,'' said the letter to pilots from Tom Matthews, Eastern's
senior vice president for human resources, and Don Breeding, vice
president for flight operations.
   The pilots' contract officially becomes open for amendment July
1, and the latest talks were not official negotiations, Cole said.
   Eastern has been negotiating a new contract with the Machinists,
the largest of the three unions at the financially troubled
carrier, since last fall.
   Eastern is a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., the
nation's largest airline holding company.

<HEAD>Study: Chrysler Plant Closing To Cost Taxpayers $209 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union-commissioned study says Chrysler
Corp.'s planned shutdown of auto production here would cost more
than $209 million in the first two years for welfare and jobless
benefits and lost tax revenue.
   The two-year social cost analysis by the Midwest Center for
Labor Research in Chicago estimated the cost to local, state and
federal governments from the plant shutdown at $38,000 for each
unemployed Chrysler worker.
   Chrysler announced in January it plans to end auto production at
Kenosha by Sept. 30, laying off 5,500 workers. Chrysler took over
the plant last year as part of its purchase of American Motors Corp.
   ``Of about the two dozen studies that we've done, that's the
highest figure we've ever come up with,'' Greg LeRoy, MCLR research
director, told reporters at the United Auto Workers Local 72
headquarters Monday.
   LeRoy said the study, commissioned by Local 72, was based on a
previous MCLR study in 1985 but used more comprehensive welfare and
employment figures from the state, Kenosha and Racine counties and
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   It estimated that the plant's closing would result in $62.4
million in unemployment compensation, $54.5 million in lost federal
income tax revenue, $26 million in lost Social Security tax
revenue, $21.4 million in welfare expenditures and $17 million in
lost state sales and excise tax revenue.
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson has threatened to sue Chrysler,
claiming the automaker broke a promise to keep the plant open for
five years.
   Chrysler officials have said they may have been overly
optimistic when negotiating with the state for improvements and job
training funds, but have repeatedly denied making any such promise.

<HEAD>European Investor to Take Control of Cannon Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European investor Giancarlo Paretti will
assume control of Cannon Group Inc., the ailing entertainment
company headed by Menachem Golan and Yoram Globus.
   Under an agreement unveiled Monday, Cannon's film entities would
become Cannon Entertainment Group, a separate division under Golan
and Globus. However, the two men would no longer jointly control
the company.
   Cannon would be headed by Paretti as chief executive officer and
Florio Fiorini as chairman.
   Paretti and his wife own 40 percent of Cannon stock.
   ``Paretti and certain of his affiliates and associates have
committed to inject additional equity into Cannon over the next 12
months, with a value of at least $100 million,'' a Cannon statement
said.
   The form of equity to be infused into the company had not been
determined, Paretti said in the statement. He said, however, he was
considering diversifying Cannon through travel, real estate and
insurance operations in Europe.
   Cannon finances, produces and distributes films for theatrical
release and handles distribution for pay television and home video
markets. The company has been plagued by a lack of hit films in
recent years.
   The company has delayed reporting its fourth-quarter losses,
which company officials recently described as ``very substantial.''
Last year, the company said its losses for 1987 would surpass the
$60 million figure reported the previous year.
   Cannon also announced plans Monday to produce 20 feature films
next year.
   Among its recently completed works are ``Evil Angels'' with
Meryl Streep; ``Hanna's War'' with Ellen Burstyn, and ``Hero'' with
Chuck Norris.

   The stock market took a tentative step into
positive territory today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.32 to 2,097.31 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 410 up, 582
down and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.19 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market headed lower at the opening bell, and analysts noted
that the pull back was not unusual after last week's impressive
rise.
   ``It went up a long way, and we expect it to retrench,'' said
Hidegarde Zagorski, vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   ``Once the selling is over, (stocks) will move into higher
ground,'' she said. Indeed, within the first half hour the market
turned upward.
   Analysts noted that investors may be waiting for Thursday's
release of merchandise trade figures for February. In addition, the
2,100-level on the Dow appears to be a psychological barrier.
   ``The Dow has bumped its head against that level so many times,
so there is some hesitation'' when it approaches that level,
Zagorski said.
   Among the most actively traded issues were USX Corp., up | at
32|; Salomon Inc., up | at 23[; Colt Industries, down | at 17|, and
National Semiconductor, down [ at 13[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.11 to 152.36.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.80 to 2,095.99
on top of last week's 102.13-point jump.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 926 up, 624 down and 436 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 146.37 million shares, against 169.30 million in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Nissan Will Curb Car Exports To the United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Co., Japan's No. 2 automaker, will
reduce car exports to the United States to ease pressure from
mounting inventories, Nissan officials said Tuesday.
   They wouldn't specify the scale of the planned reduction. But
Japanese press reports, which Nissan officials called speculative,
said the company will cut shipments of passenger cars by about 30
percent to 200,000 in the April-September period from 283,000 a
year earlier.
   Nissan dealers in the United States are flooded with unsold
cars, an auto-industry analyst in Tokyo said.
   According to U.S. industry estimates, Nissan had about 155 days'
worth of inventories in the U.S. at the beginning of March, well
above the 70-day average for Japanese carmakers as a whole.
   Nissan attributes its sales slump in the United States to
complete model changes planned later this year for some of its
popular cars, such as 200SX coupes and Maxima sedans. Consumers
tend to refrain from buying cars that are slated for restyling and
other major changes, Nissan officials explained.
   Industry watchers said Nissan's newly styled models in the
domestic market are proving popular among consumers. However,
because of the scale of the company, which sells about 2.7 million
units of motor vehicles worldwide annually, it takes about four
years to carry out a full, company-wide model changeover.
   Nissan began restraining U.S.-bound car shipments late last year
as a result of a sales slowdown following price hikes forced under
the yen's prolonged strength.
   Mainly because of Nissan's slower exports, Japan's car shipments
to the United States in the year ended March 31 fell short of the
2.3 million-unit limit for the first time since the restraints were
imposed by the Japanese government in 1980.
   According to unofficial industry figures, Japanese car exports
to the U.S. fell about 86,000 units short of the limit last year.
   Japan decided it would continue the ceiling at 2.3 million units
a year for the new year beginning April 1.

<HEAD>Tighter Banking Scrutiny After Marcos, Duvalier Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swiss banks and big financial
institutions will come under closer supervision in accepting funds
from foreign leaders, the Swiss Banking Commission said Tuesday.
   The cases of deposed presidents Ferdinand Marcos of the
Philippines and Jean-Claude Duvalier of Haiti sparked the need for
stronger surveillance, the regulatory agency said in its annual
report.
   Philippines officials claim Marcos stashed up to about $5
billion in Switzerland during his 20-year rule. Duvalier is alleged
to have diverted several hundred million dollars into Swiss
accounts. Both were ousted from office in 1986.
   The commission's probe of the case failed to find any wrongdoing
by the banks involved, which were not named. But the agency said it
will now require top management of Swiss banks, rather than
lower-ranking employees, to judge whether to take up or continue
``such exposed business ties.''
   The panel also called for tougher Swiss laws against money
laundering, terming existing measures insufficient to combat the
practice. Lawmakers should consider criminal penalties for legal
entities caught laundering money, it said.
   On other topics, it said that in the wake of last October's
stock market crash, banks will have to report more openly on how
they cover losses in securities trading, and on notes issues.

<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnson & Johnson has ended its attempt to
acquire the family products subsidiary of Playtex Holdings Inc.,
the companies said.
   The sale was scuttled because of ``difficulties in structuring
and completing the definitive agreements for the transaction,'' a
joint statement by both companies said Monday.
   Officials declined to elaborate further.
   ``The business had a highly successful year in 1987 and is off
to a strong start in 1988,'' Joel E. Smilow, chairman and chief
executive officer of Playtex, said in a statement.
   ``If you look in The Wall Street Journal, there are stories of
similar deals that fell through every day,'' said F. Robert
Kniffen, spokesman for Johnson & Johnson.
   Since news of the possible sale became public Feb. 16, there was
speculation that Johnson & Johnson would close or move the
subsidiary. Delaware officials had begun attempts to try to
persuade Johnson & Johnson to keep the jobs in the state. About 700
workers are employed at the complex.
   The family products subsidiary manufactures and markets tampons,
disposable baby bottles, rubber gloves and toothbrushes.
   Playtex's intimate apparel subsidiary is in Dover and the
facility also is the distribution point for products made by other
divisions.
   Playtex is continuing to seek a buyer for its Jhirmack hair
products subsidiary, Smilow said. Jhirmack products are distributed
through Dover.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerald W. Fronterhouse, chairman of financially
troubled First RepublicBank Corp., is expected to submit his
resignation today, according to published reports.
   The resignation is believed to be part of a management shake-up
arranged by federal regulators overseeing recapitalization of the
big bank holding company, the Dallas Morning News reported.
   Spokesmen for the Dallas-based company declined to comment on
the report.
   A meeting of the full board of directors was scheduled for late
today. Board members also are expected to review the company's
first-quarter results, which banking analysts expect to include
another large loss.
   Fronterhouse, 51, succeeded James D. Berry as chairman of
predecessor RepublicBank Corp. in July 1986. He has spent his
entire 26-year banking career at First RepublicBank.
   Fronterhouse's resignation would add to a list of senior
management changes since the company's troubles began. The most
recent change came three weeks ago when Charles H. Pistor Jr.,
chairman of the lead bank First RepublicBank Dallas, announced he
would leave in mid-April and Fronterhouse would assume his duties.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. loaned $1 billion last month
to First RepublicBank Corp., the nation's 13th-largest bank,
securing with it a deal with company officials that its most senior
executives would resign if asked to by the FDIC.
   The banking company, which claims $33.2 billion in assets,
reported a $656.8 million loss for 1987 after non-performing loans
in real estate, oil and other areas soared to nearly $4 billion.

<HEAD>Japan Notes Shift in Economy as Fiscal-Year Surplus Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A change in the structure of Japan's economy
contributed to the first decline in Japan's fiscal-year trade
surplus in eight years, government and private analysts said
Tuesday.
   The Finance Ministry announced Monday that Japan's overall trade
surplus dropped 15.3 percent in the fiscal year ended March 31 to
$76 billion from $89.7 billion in the previous fiscal year.
   It was the first decline since 1979, when Japan's oil import
bill soared because of the second oil crisis.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States posted its first
annual decline since 1982, dropping 2.2 percent to $50.9 billion
from a record $52 billion the year before.
   ``A shift toward the direction of a decline in trade surplus is
taking place at a steady pace,'' said Nobuo Murakami, deputy
director of the Finance Ministry's Export Division.
   The yen's rapid appreciation against the dollar the past two
years and the government policy to promote domestic demand were
major factors in the decline in the surplus, Murakami said.
   The yen has roughly doubled in value against the dollar since
its most recent low in February 1985. In September 1985, monetary
authorities from seven major industrialized countries agreed to
drive down the dollar's value to help reduce the huge U.S. trade
deficit.
   A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and
less competitive, while imported products are cheaper in Japan.
   Japan sent 35.8 percent of its exports to the United States in
fiscal year 1987, down from 38 percent the previous year. Its
exports to the European Economic Community increased to 16.7
percent from 15.4 percent, and to Southeast Asian countries to 23.7
percent from 20.6 percent.
   ``It is clear that some major Japanese products, including
automobiles, are losing their competiveness on the U.S. market,
though personal computers and other office equipment remain in high
demand,'' said Taku Hiramatsu, assistant manager of the research
department of Bank of Tokyo.
   Hiramatsu said Japan's auto exports to the United States, which
accounted for about 30 percent of the nation's total exports to the
United States, ``will be getting further squeezed in the future''
because several Japanese automakers will be making car in the
United States in 1990s.
   Japanese automakers have fallen short of the government-set
export quota of 2.3 million passenger cars during the year, the
first such shortfall since Japan began limting its auto exports to
the U.S. market in 1981, local news reports said Tuesday.
   An official of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association
said the figures for Japan's car exports to the United States would
be announced late this month, and the volume would be ``far below''
the 2.3 million vehicles sent to America the previous year.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, blamed the
shortfall on the higher yen and the ``slower-than-expected increase
in the U.S. car market.''
   Japanese car makers have raised their export prices to the
United States by more than 20 percent on the average over the past
two years to make up for losses stemming from the dollar's
depreciation.
   ``More significant results in the reduction of (Japan's) trade
surplus with the United States will surely come in years to come,''
Murakami said. ``It's just two years since the yen's appreciation
began.''

<TEXT>
   Allis-Chalmers Corp. said Tuesday it has
agreed to sell its air quality control business for $245 million in
cash to Snyder General Corp., a Texas-based manufacturer of heating
and air conditioning equipment.
   Allis-Chalmers' air quality control business is operated by the
company's American Air Filter subsidiary, which is based in
Louisville, Ky.
   The company described American Air Filter as the world's largest
supplier of air filter products and well as a supplier of heating,
ventilating and air conditioning equipment and air pollution
control products.
   The air quality control segment had $275 million in sales last
year.
   Allis-Chalmers filed for protection from its creditors under
federal bankruptcy laws last June while it prepares a financial
reorganization plan.
   Wendell F. Bueche, Allis-Chalmers' chairman and chief executive,
said the sale is subject to review by the various parties in the
reorganization proceedings and the approval of regulators and the
Bankruptcy Court as well as by the Allis-Chalmers and Snyder
General boards.
   The acquisition will bring Snyder General, which is based in
Dallas, ``strengths of reputation, product and distribution that
strategically complement our current business,'' said Richard
Snyder, chairman and chief executive.
   Snyder General is a privately-held company with sales in excess
of $500 million and employs about 5,000 people.
   Its eight domestic and two European manufacturing facilities
produce McQuay commercial air conditioning and refrigeration
products, Arcoaire and Comfortmaker residential and light
commercial heating and cooling equipment, Barry Blower fans,
Webster air handling systems and fan coils and Climate Control
refrigeration systems.

   District Court Judge M.W. Deo cancelled
Tuesday's scheduled hearing on the Bhopal gas disaster but set a
deadline of April 23 for outlining a hearing schedule in the case,
the United News of India reported.
   Deo adjourned the proceedings after lawyers for both Union
Carbide Corp. and the Indian government said they had not yet
received a copy of a higher court's ruling on Deo's earlier order
that Carbide pay interim reief to the victims of the accident.
   India is suing Union Carbide for $3 billion in damages for the
1984 gas leak from the pesticides plant operated by one of the
company's subsidiaries. More than 2,800 people were killed and
hundreds were injured in the accident.
   Last December, Deo ordered Union Carbide to pay interim relief
to the victims, and the company appealed the ruling to the High
Court in Jabalpur, about 150 miles east of Bhopal.
   The High Court on April 4 rejected Union Carbide's appeal and
ordered the multinational to pay $192 million in interim relief to
the victims.
   Union Carbide has not yet said whether it will appeal the
decision to the Indian Supreme Court.

   Six months after the stock market crash of 1987,
a sense of shock and confusion still pervades Wall Street.
   As the days, weeks and months have passed since Black Monday on
Oct. 19, many industry leaders, market analysts and investors have
been relieved to see the damage, extensive as it was, apparently
contained.
   Stock prices have since recovered some of their losses. Several
reforms are being made in the mechanism of the marketplace itself.
And, perhaps most important of all, the economy has endured the
experience with hardly any sign of significant damage.
   But the crash still weighs heavily on just about any financial
decision or economic forecast these days. By all accounts, it has
severely dampened the enthusiasm of both professional money
managers and the American public for stock investments.
   Trading volume in all the major stock markets so far in 1988 is
running behind the pace it set a year ago. Through April 8, volume
was down 4.1 percent at the New York Stock Stock Exchange, and 16.7
percent in the over-the-counter market.
   The NYSE decline would be much bigger were it not for heavy
trading in stocks of companies targeted for takeovers and
high-yielding issues with impending dividend payments.
   Veteran observers caution that it will take still more time to
assess the crash's ultimate effects. Even with the advantage of
hindsight, it is clear that the crash was many different things to
many different people.
   At one extreme, some analysts will tell you Black Monday was
just the first stage of a severe bear market that will usher in a
recession _ or worse _ in the nation's economy.
   At the other, some insist it was nothing more than an
exaggerated ``correction'' that drove excessive enthusiasm out of
the marketplace, setting the stage for new rallies in stock prices
and helping to prevent a recession that might otherwise be in
progress today.
   While there isn't yet, and may never be, a widely accepted
consensus on what precisely caused the crash, a good many analysts
have come to agree that it stemmed in large measure from a change
in the credit policies of the Federal Reserve and central banks of
other prominent industrialized countries.
   In this view, these powerful institutions created a financial
boom in the mid-1980s by fostering the growth of a vast pool of
``liquidity,'' or money looking for a place to go to work.
   Starting in early 1987, they began to shut off the flow,
prompted by fears of inflation and a long decline in the value of
the dollar against leading foreign currencies.
   Economist Albert Wojnilower, a managing director at the Wall
Street firm of First Boston Corp., said in a recent appraisal:
   ``As 1987 wore on, it became more and more evident _ so that
ultimately even the stock markets had to accept the fact _ that
U.S. monetary policy was on a course leading to an eventual
recession.''
   That recession didn't arrive on schedule, Wojnilower added,
because restrictive monetary policies were immediately abandoned in
the aftermath of the crash.
   He says a business slump is still in the offing, probably in
1989, ``but it need not be severe. The end of the world is not at
hand.''
   With all the studies, investigations and reports by blue-ribbon
panels that have been done since the crash, major steps to reform
and fortify the markets have come slowly or not at all.
   The presidential commission headed by Nicholas F. Brady of
Dillon, Read & Co. promoted the idea that the nation's financial
markets _ the stock market and the futures market where contracts
on stock indexes are traded _ could be set up and managed as ``one
market.''
   The Brady plan called for coordinating the regulation of the
markets and installing ``circuit breakers'' that would prevent a
crisis from erupting in one market and spreading to the other.
   Those who blame computer-driven program trading for contributing
to the October debacle point out that such techniques are triggered
by discrepancies in the prices of stock index futures and the
underlying equities. But the two markets have long operated under
significantly different rules and have resisted regulatory changes
that might threaten their franchises.
   Brady's super-regulatory proposal has been bogged down by
haggling over who would be the super regulator. Although the Brady
panel favored the Federal Reserve, the central bank appears
reluctant to take on the job.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is more willing to fill
the void, but regulators of the futures markets have resisted the
idea of turning over a measure of their authority to the SEC.
   To help sort out the competing interests, the White House has
appointed yet another committee, comprised of representatives of
the various regulatory agencies, which is expected to report still
more recommendations later this spring.
   The New York Stock Exchange has adopted one notable new rule _ a
constraint known as a ``collar'' that bars use of its main
order-processing system for one method of program trading should
the Dow Jones industrial average rise or fall on any given day by
as much as 50 points.
   In addition, the NYSE has announced a sharp increase in the
amount of capital that must be held by its specialists, the brokers
who act as meeting points for buy and sell orders on the trading
floor.
   Separately, the National Association of Securities Dealers has
moved to try to strengthen the over-the-counter market for unlisted
stocks, which it oversees.
   By summer, NASD procedures are scheduled to be in effect to
decrease the market's dependency on voice communication by
telephone, and to punish dealers who back away from fast-moving
markets without a special-case excuse.
   The aim of such measures is to increase the markets' strength
and accessibility in times of stress, so that the machinery doesn't
break down altogether and turn an already bad situation into a
disaster.
   Still, many regulators and securities industry officials say it
would be pointless and quite possibly dangerous to attempt to
legislate away the threat of any future crashes.
   If the Fed were standing by with its enormous resources as a
buyer of last resort in times of crisis, presumably the stock
market would be less susceptible, if not immune, to panics. But
something like that would also cost the market what Joseph
Hardiman, president of the NASD, calls ``the discipline of risk.''
   If investors believed they could rely indefinitely on an
institution like the Fed to support the market, they might well go
on a speculative binge that would create stresses not even the Fed
could deal with.
   Under this line of reasoning, the quickest way to set the stage
for the next market crash would be to create a system to assure
everybody that it could never happen again.

   The strength of the U.S. economy since the Oct.
19 stock market crash has demolished the belief that history
invariably repeats itself.
   Generations of schoolchildren learned that the stock market
crashed in October 1929 and the nation then slid into a depression
from which it did not fully recover until World War II.
   Last year's crash was even bigger than 1929's. Half a trillion
dollars of stock wealth was wiped out in a single day as the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 508 points, a record
22.6 percent.
   Yet six months later, the unemployment rate is at a nine-year
low and industries such as steel, paper and chemicals are straining
to keep up with booming demand.
   In fact, many economists now believe the crash helped keep the
economic expansion alive by throwing cold water on inflation fears
and bringing about lower interest rates.
   Suddenly the idea of a crashing stock market doesn't seem so
frightening _ especially to the 80 percent of households that don't
own stock.
   Of course, fearful chart watchers point out that even though the
Dow average is rebounding now, it also rebounded after the 1929
crash.
   They note that while President Reagan is optimistic in April
1988, President Herbert Hoover was optimistic in April 1930.
   By extension, the pessimists conclude that history may yet
repeat itself. Poverty, they say, may be just around the corner.
   The attempt to draw parallels falls short, however.
   ``People who argue that history will repeat itself simply don't
understand history,'' said Richard Day, an economist at the
University of Southern California.
   History shows that stock indexes may repeat previous patterns
for a few months but inevitably go off in different directions, Day
said.
   The economy of 1988 is far healthier and more resistant to
shocks than the economy of 1930 was. For example:
   _The rise of service jobs means Americans are more insulated
from the ups and downs of farming and manufacturing, two sectors
that led the way into the Great Depression.
   _Unemployment insurance, Social Security and other programs
protect Americans, and the economy as a whole, from sudden drops in
income.
   _The 1929 crash came against the backdrop of recession.
Industrial production had fallen at an annual rate of 20 percent
since August of that year. Prices and incomes fell, too. This time
production, prices and incomes have all been rising.
   _World trade spiraled downward in the late 1920s and early 1930s
because of slumping economies and protectionism. This time world
trade is expanding and the crash helped dissuade Congress from
enacting a replay of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff act of 1930.
   _Finally, New Deal regulatory reforms instituted in the 1930s,
such as federal deposit insurance, helped keep Wall Street's fear
from infecting the banking system this time. The Federal Reserve,
which bungled its job after the 1929 crash, acted quickly to quell
panic.
   ``Money is not disappearing into mattresses,'' said Brent
Erensel, senior banking analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. Consumer confidence rebounded to pre-crash levels
within months.
   Economists worried last fall that Wall Street was a canary in a
coal mine, sending an early warning of disaster. Now many believe
the signal was false.
   ``These sudden drops, caused by this kind of ... stampede
behavior _ you just kind of ignore that. It doesn't give you much
information,'' said William Brock, a University of Wisconsin
economist.
   To be sure, the U.S. economy is not glowingly healthy. Last
year, 184 banks failed, the most since the Depression. But the
closings were orderly, not triggered by bank runs. In the 1930s,
panics forced thousands of banks to close annually.
   Depositors assume, correctly, that regulators will not allow
major banks to fail, said Christopher Mahoney, an associate
director at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   There are other problems: the trade deficit, the budget deficit,
the Third World debt bomb. Unemployment and poverty persist in an
underclass of disadvantaged minorities.
   But the problems, while worrisome, don't point to a 1930s-style
depression, most economists say.
   ``Right after the Monday massacre people said, `Oh my God, here
we go again,''' but now no one is quite certain why the crash
occurred or what it means, Wisconsin's Brock said.
   ``As one jokester said, `If we could have another one of these,
maybe we could settle this debate.'''

   The Japanese stock market's unrelenting climb to
new heights since Black Monday has made the land of the rising sun
and its booming economy the envy of every market struggling to
regain lost momentum.
   Unlike the crash, when markets from Brussels, Belgium to
Singapore plummeted in reaction to Wall Street's collapse, the
recovery of world markets since Oct. 19 has been relatively uneven.
   Markets have followed the pace of their own economies, and
investors who once roamed the globe in search of equities have
returned to the backyard markets they know best.
   ``I don't think I could describe any spillover effects,'' said
Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. ``It's more the case that stock markets seem to
be tracking economic growth internally.''
   So far this year, major stock markets outside the United States
are up about 13.5 percent, according to an index compiled by Morgan
Stanley & Co., while the U.S. market is up about 4.5 percent.
   European markets have turned in a mixed performance since the
crash. The Brussels exchange is up on takeover activity; West
Germany's market is sluggish; and a slow-growing French economy is
taking its toll on the Bourse.
   But if those markets show glimmers of life, the advance has been
blinding in Japan, home of the world's biggest equities market.
While the Dow Jones industrial average has sputtered to and fro
beneath pre-crash levels, Japan's key market barometer has reached
stunning all-time highs with ease.
   The key Nikkei 100-share index breezed its way into record
territory in early April.
   ``The story this year really is mostly a story about Japan,''
said Mark Sladkus, a vice president at Morgan Stanley. But, he
noted, the market's momentum isn't due to its magnetic attraction
for investors outside the island nation.
   ``It's totally due to domestic considerations,'' Sladkus said.
   Spurred by a roaring financial boom, Japan's stock market is
reaping the benefits of a surge in corporate profits, a sharp
increase in consumption and tax reforms that are likely to prompt
consumers to move their money out of savings accounts and into
equities.
   While the quick about-face isn't causing Japanese investors to
lose any sleep, some on the other side of the ocean watch with
furrowed brows.
   ``There's concern that with the market going up so strongly and
with the economy growing that maybe the Bank of Japan is not going
to be as accommodative,'' Brusca said, noting that some fear
Japan's central bank ``could take away one important underpinning
of the market _ the liquidity that helped spur the growth'' in the
first place.
   ``Nobody is quite comfortable that a country the size of
California and with half the population of the United States has
the biggest stock market, even though (the Japanese) seem to do
everything right,'' said Byron Wien, managing director and U.S.
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
remains about 25 percent below its level just prior to the crash.
Despite the fact that the market has been extremely volatile,
analysts aren't too concerned about the speed of its recovery.
   ``The equity market was overvalued before the crash,'' said
Randal Goldsmith, a market strategist with the London investment
firm James Capel & Co. ``There's no reason to go right back up to
that level yet.''
   The market has been supported by an increase in the number of
companies buying back their own shares, heightened takeover
activity, better-than-expected corporate profits and relief that
the economy wasn't hit harder by the crash.
   Thanks to the takeover battle for Societe Generale de Belgique,
the largest Belgian corporation, the Brussels Bourse has put in the
best performance among the European exchanges.
   In Hong Kong, where the stock exchange shut down for four days
following Black Monday, trading volume stalled and investor
confidence had to be rebuilt from the ground up. But the market is
enjoying some spillover enthusiasm from Japan, since ``the Asian
investment community is linked together,'' Brusca noted.
   West Germany, on the other hand, is a ``dog, if you will; it's a
real barker,'' Brusca said. ``They've been experiencing sluggish
growth, their monetary policy remains restrictive, and their
currency is appreciating, which makes it difficult for German firms
to sell their products overseas for a profit,'' he said.
   Trading volume throughout the world has been relatively light,
which analysts say is a sign of confusion among investors.
   To alleviate fears of the unknown, international investors went
home.
   ``People were operating in markets overseas that they didn't
understand that well, and so they brought their money home. These
markets may not be doing so well, but at least investors understand
them,'' Brusca said.

   The Federal Aviation Administration is
investigating safety complaints from airlines about Boeing 747 and
767 widebody jets and has issued a safety inspection directive for
one of the aerospace company's jetliner models.
   FAA officials revealed Monday that an ``airworthiness
directive'' on the 747-200 was issued Friday because of reports
that fuel leaking into cargo compartments.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes officials refused Monday to respond
to the airline complaints or comment on the FAA action, but said
they would hold a news conference later.
   However, Phil A. Condit, executive vice president of Boeing
Commercial Airplanes, was quoted in today's editions of The Wall
Street Journal as saying letters from the airlines represent
``communications that go on between us and airlines all the time.
That's how we make our products better.''
   Airline, Boeing and FAA officials have noted that none of the
defects cited to date has been linked to a crash or other major
damage, but the directive warned, ``Fuel in this (cargo)
compartment could result in a fire and substantial damage.''
   The directive said the leaks were caused by loose or broken
bolts that attach fuel tanks to the wings and called for repairs
``before further flight.'' Boeing officials said the order applied
to 317 operating 747-200s.
   Nick Wantiez of the local FAA office said Monday the
investigation also would cover airline complaints ranging from
wrong parts to incorrectly installed firefighting systems.
   ``We are putting together a plan this week to deal with these
complaints and to determine what actions must be taken to assure
compliance with federal regulations,'' Wantiez said.
   He said the inspection order followed reports of incidents by
Japan Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Lufthansa, Air India,
Aerolineas Argentinas and a leasing company, starting Nov. 21 with
a JAL report in Los Angeles of a fuel leak involving a bold that
had broken from corrosion.
   David Jimenez of Boeing confirmed Monday that letters citing
problems in 767s and 747s had been received from Japan Air Lines,
All Nippon Airways, British Airways and American Airlines.
   Problems cited by All Nippon included a wing flap disintegrating
in flight on the first day of service, smoke from a misassembled
power unit that caused an emergency landing, and problems in a fire
extinguisher system.
   Bob Baker, American's senior vice president for operations, said
his company's maintenance crews found three 767-200s with faulty
pipelines that carry firefighting chemicals to the forward and rear
cargo compartments.
   ``The pipes were misrouted,'' Baker said. ``If you light them
off for the forward belly system they go off in the rear.''
   Baker said that after being informed by American, Boeing found
one faulty system on its production line and All Nippon and JAL
found several in their planes.

   For Richard S. Locke, E.F. Hutton Group Inc.'s
post-crash demise derailed a 13-year career at the once-proud
investment giant, leaving him jobless.
   Dean Thompson scrambled to start his own company after Hutton's
new parent Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. fired him. Jack Clevenger
was among the luckier ones: Shearson invited him to stay.
   Hutton was the biggest Wall Street casualty in the aftermath of
the Oct. 19 collapse in stock prices. Already reeling from
management struggles, excessive expenses, declining profits and the
legacy of an embarassing check-kiting scandal, the crash sent the
company into a desperate search for a buyer.
   The new Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. describes itself as one of
the strongest and biggest brokerages. But the marriage has left at
least 6,000 people out of work.
   ``I was concerned long before the crash that the end was near,''
Locke said in an interview. ``Nothing lasts forever. We'd had a
bull market for five years. The compensation had gotten out of
hand.''
   Locke, former senior executive vice president and managing
director of Hutton's public finance unit, had at one time been in
charge of more than 80 investment bankers and earned a $700,000
salary.
   When Shearson acquired Hutton in December, Locke said he was at
first invited to say, but quickly discovered there was no place for
him in the merged operation. ``I felt redundant. We parted
friends,'' he said.
   Now the 50-year-old veteran spends his time visiting potential
job contacts and using a borrowed office and telephone to arrange
interviews. He is considering moving to the West Coast and might
start his own consulting firm.
   ``I don't know what October 19th was, a signal or an accident,''
he said. ``But I think Wall Street faces much more consolidation.''
   Locke said his only Hutton memento is an antique he and his wife
bought, a carved-out pig from a butcher's shop with the
inscription, ``Hutton's For Pork.''
   But Locke said he harbored no bitterness toward Hutton. ``I've
been in this business too long to get angry,'' he said.
   For Thompson, who had worked at Shearson's parent American
Express Co. before he quit and went to Hutton four years ago as
vice president in charge of its in-house financial video unit,
there was a bitter irony in the acquisition. ``In a roundabout way
I was hoist by my own petard,'' said Thompson, 41. ``Dad came back
and sucked us up.''
   Thompson said he earned nearly $100,000 at Hutton producing an
internal monthly news show, sales promotions and advertising. Like
everybody else at Hutton, he was well aware of the company's
problems but wasn't prepared for the sudden finale.
   ``The big shock was the speed with which it took place,'' he
said of the merger announcement. ``Twelve days later we were
fired.''
   With a half-dozen other people in his department, Thompson
negotiated to acquire Hutton's video production facilities, housed
in a second-floor office building in Manhattan's wholesale
merchandise district north of Wall Street.
   Thompson started Metro Production Group Inc., which has since
received video production assignments from several financial
service companies.
   Dressed in casual clothes behind a simple black desk in his
office, Thompson was philosophical about the sudden change and said
he expected to do ``as well, if not better.''
   Nevertheless, he said, ``Let's face it. When I saw the movie
`Broadcast News,' I loved the line where the fired executive told
the boss, `I hope you die real soon.'''
   For Clevenger, who started with Hutton in 1969, the Shearson
acquisition injected stability and relief. As a first vice
president in Hutton's consulting services unit in Kansas City,
Clevenger had long been worried because of client concerns about
Hutton's health.
   ``I was pleased that the merger happened,'' said the 42-year-old
father of two.
   He wouldn't disclose his salary, but as one of the senior people
in Hutton's nationwide network, he was among the highest paid.
Although his post-crash business is down 20 percent, Clevenger
said, ``I'm guessing that when the year's over, I'll be in
approximately the same position with the combined firm.''
   Nevertheless, he said, he had some regrets about Hutton's
collapse.
   ``I'm remorseful because of what it did to a group of people
that I relate to, particularly the 600 or 700 people who are part
of our division. Some of the closeness has gone because some of
these people have left,'' he said.

   When recruiters for accounting giant Touche Ross
& Co. visited graduate business schools earlier this year, students
scrambled to get interviews. At the same time, the venerable
investment banking firm Goldman Sachs & Co. had trouble finding
good candidates.
   The contrast illustrates what students, school officials and
campus recruiters agree is a disillusionment with Wall Street
careers in the aftermath of the October stock market crash and a
corresponding surge of interest in high-paying consulting and
accounting professions.
   ``We found here that the presentations investment banks made
were not attended well at all,'' said Joyce Watts, director of
career counseling and placement at Northwestern University's J.L.
Kellogg Graduate School of Management. ``That's very different than
in the last five years, when you could hardly get in the door of a
presentation.''
   Graduate business students participating in a recent conference
at Northwestern said that consulting positions, which offer
starting salaries ranging from $50,000 to $100,000, are a lot more
attractive than investment banking careers now because of the
employment uncertainty raised by the crash.
   ``A good part of my class had pegged hopes on Wall Street,''
said Mark Sheridan, a 28-year-old Cornell University business
student at the conference. ``You see a lot of chameleons out there.
Suddenly they're all into consulting.''
   Several schools have projected sharp reductions in the number of
students who will go into investment banking this year. At Kellogg,
for example, only about 12 percent will accept Wall Street offers,
down from 17 percent last year. Columbia University expects about
15 percent, down from 28 percent, and Pennsylvania's Wharton School
expects about 15 percent, down from 25 percent.
   Wall Street firms themselves have been curtailing campus
recruitment drives this year, partly because they are undergoing
their own post-crash retrenchment. But many have found the pool of
MBA talent has shrunk.
   ``This year we've had more people turn down jobs than in the
past five years,'' said James P. Gorter, a Goldman Sachs partner
who spoke at the Northwestern conference.
   Roy Cohen, manager of professional recruiting at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets, said although his firm hunted for fewer MBAs this
year, ``student interest was down on campus, I have to be very
direct with you about that.''
   Although Merrill Lynch had no trouble filling positions, Cohen
said ``with the downturn in the market, students were starting to
think about less risk-oriented careers.''
   The shift has been welcomed by major consulting and accounting
firms, which are enjoying strong growth and seeking thousands of
additional MBA graduates. At Arthur Andersen & Co., for example,
recruiters expect to hire 8,000 new employees this year, said
Lawrence A. Weinbach, a managing partner.
   John N. Fox Jr., a Touche Ross partner with recruiting
responsibilities, said he has noticed much stronger interest from
leading schools.
   ``At Harvard, we saw 230 people, more than we've ever seen
before,'' Fox said. ``Previously, we've seen 150, 160.''
   Fox said at least some of those additional applicants had been
pursuing a Wall Street career prior to October.
   ``I think those always interested in investment banking are
still interviewing,'' Fox said. ``Others have been sobered by
what's happened.''

   New York City, the epicenter of last October's
stock market quake, remains jumpy at any aftershocks and watches
warily for warning signs of future trouble.
   ``So far, so good,'' is the opinion of Samuel Ehrenhalt, the
regional commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
``The economy has held up better than most expected, but we still
haven't got the situation fully in focus.''
   Among the fuzzy images, six months later:
   _The city, whose financial worries faded during the bull market,
has scaled back its plans for growth. The goal of a 30,000-member
police department is on hold, two firehouses are closed, and
museums and libraries found their budgets cut.
   _The real estate market, though still inflated by standards of
most American cities, has lost some steam, with office vacancy
rates up, several construction projects on hold and condos no
longer guaranteed to skyrocket in value.
   _Unemployment figures remain stable overall, but layoffs in the
financial sector may show up in the statistics later as severance
pay runs out for some and as businesses that depend on Wall Street
are forced to follow suit.
   The city adopted a cautious stance almost immediately after the
crash. Within 10 days, Mayor Edward I. Koch had ordered a 90-day
hiring freeze.
   ``We needed the three months to evaluate what the crash meant,''
said Anthony Shorris, deputy director of the city Office of
Management and Budget. The city recalculated its projections for
fiscal 1989 _ July 1 to June 30, 1989 _ and figured its tax
revenues would be about $270 million less than expected.
   ``A lot of people were doomsayers, taking terrible, grim
positions'' after the crash, Shorris said. ``In context, $270
million out of a tax base of $14 billion is hardly a major change.
But there was a reduction of growth.''
   The slowdown in the local economy will force the city to keep a
tight rein on spending. Plans to expand the Sanitation Department
were cut by 260 positions. The Department of Cultural Affairs saw
its fiscal 1989 budget cut by $5.6 million; libraries will get $7.7
million less than originally expected, which will probably result
in shorter hours and other cuts in services.
   Yet Shorris said the true effect of the crash shows up not so
much in the data about the city that pours into his office, but in
conversations and attitudes across the nation.
   ``More than the crash itself, it was reevaluation of nation's
economy that was the most important byproduct,'' Shorris said.
``That has a very important effect on us. New York City has been
more affected than almost any other city or state because of the
high concentration of security and finance activity.''
   One obvious casualty of the crash was a two-tower office complex
planned for the southwest corner of Central Park, with the
investment firm Salomon Brothers as the prime tenant. Though the
firm gave a variety of reasons for pulling out of the project, the
crash and subsequent cutbacks contributed.
   That also hurt the city, which was counting on selling the
property for $455 million, including $40 million in subway
improvements.
   ``There's really been a reassessment of new construction.
Several projects have been put on hold as a result of Black
Monday,'' said Lloyd Lynford, a real estate market analyst and
publisher of an industry newsletter.
   The office vacancy rate was at 9{ percent in October and may be
in the 14 percent range by the end of this year, Lynford said,
noting that one percentage point represents 3.5 million square feet
_ or more than half of one of the World Trade Center towers.
   In the residential market, he said, ``Unless you're talking
about the premier residential units in the city, there has been and
will be a comparatively more sluggish market than it has been the
last couple of years, with slower rates of appreciation.''
   Much of the shifting in the real estate market, both office and
residential, can be traced to job cuts in the financial services
industry, he said. From 1982 to 1987, 25 percent of the city's job
growth was in financial services.
   ``New York City is making a new transition into an economic
environment characterized by uncertainty, risk and vulnerability in
its dependence for growth on Wall Street and the financial
industry,'' said Ehrenhalt.
   ``We're not out of the woods yet.''

   The stock market was mixed in light trading
today as the market its digested recent gains and investors waited
for fresh economic data to be released later in the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.32 at 2,098.31
by mid-afternoon.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 in the
overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 722
down, 681 up and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 95.48 million shares at 2 p.m.
on Wall Street.
   ``The volume is very light, and what it shows is that there's no
enthusiasm,'' said Ronald Daino, a technical analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris, Upham & Co.
   Analysts were not surprised that the market was little changed,
noting that the impressive 102.13-point rise the Dow posted last
week had to be digested. While the market appeared to be staying
put throughout the session, most analysts agreed there are positive
underpinnings for equities.
   ``(The market) went up a long way, and we expect it to
retrench,'' said Hidegarde Zagorski, vice president of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., but ``once the selling is over,
it will move into higher ground.''
   Meanwhile, many investors remain on the sidelines as they await
the release of new economic data. While they are certain to focus
on February's merchandise trade report due out on Thursday, the
release of retail sales figures and a meeting of the Group of Seven
major industrial countries, both scheduled for Wednesday, are
likely to attract attention.
   ``A lot of people are going to play it close to the vest until
they see some direction from the numbers coming out,'' said Peter
Vandenberg, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Analysts also noted that investors are once again confronting
what has become a psychological barrier at the 2,100-level on the
Dow. Indeed, the key market barometer touched 2,101 shortly after
noon but then eased back.
   ``The Dow has bumped its head against that level so many times,
so there is some hesitation'' when it approaches the mark, Zagorski
said.
   Honda Motor was the shining star in an otherwise dull auto
sector, rising 3 to 146{. Aircraft issues were lower, with Boeing
falling | to 46}. The Federal Aviation Administration said it would
conduct an investigation into alleged defects in the some of the
company's wide-body jets.
   Electronic issues were mostly higher, with Honeywell up 1] to
70; Kyocera up 1} to 89{, and Matsushita up 2{ to 226.
   Among other actively traded Big Board issues, Zayre was up 1 to
24| and USX Corp. was up 1[ to 33[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
unchanged at 152.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 2.14 at 305.83.

<HEAD>Officials Agree on Restructuring Plan to Make Company More
Accountable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government participants in Airbus Industrie
approved guidelines Tuesday to overhaul management of the European
aircraft consortium and make it more accountable financially.
   The approval came against a background of intense competition
between Airbus and U.S. aircraft makers, who complain that the
company sells planes more cheaply because of unfair government aid.
Airbus denies the accusations but has been under increased internal
pressure to become more efficient.
   British Trade and Industry Minister Kenneth Clarke, Spanish
Industry Minister Luis Carlos Croissier, German Economy Ministry
State Secretary Erich Riedl and French Transport Minister Jacques
Douffiagues approved the guidelines, contained in a report
presented by four consultants, one from each country, calling for
fundamental management changes.
   Clarke told a news conference the ministers reached what he
called surprisingly speedy agreement on the need for a management
restructuring aimed at cutting costs, clarifying costs and
expenses, accelerating decision-making and running the operation
``on clear commercial lines.''
   The report asserts that despite an increase in production and
sales, Airbus Industrie had failed to reduce costs and increase
efficiency.
   Based in Toulouse, France, Airbus was created in 1970 by the
French firm Aerospatiale, British Aerospace PLC,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH of West Germany and Construcciones
Aeronauticas S.A. (CASA) of Spain, with the aid of the governments
of Britain, West Germany, France and Spain.
   Aerospatiale and MBB GmbH each own 37.9 percent of Airbus, while
British Aerospace owns 20 percent and CASA 4.2 percent. Combined
assets of the consortium exceed $12 billion.
   Riedl called the general agreement Tueday among the officials
``a giant step forward.''
   ``Airbus Industrie's pioneer stage is now something we've
definitely left behind. Airbus has come of age,'' he said.
   The officials called for Airbus and its industrial partners to
present detailed plans of action to implement the recommendations
at a meeting May 5 in Hannover, West Germany.
   Croissier said the officials did not discuss U.S. officials'
accusations of unfair government subsidies to Airbus in the Tuesday
meeting, but said recent talks between European Economic Community
officials and U.S. trade officials had led to a better climate.
   Clarke said the four governments aimed to revamp Airbus'
management structure ``so that government support is reduced.''
   Airbus has received orders for more than 1,000 aircraft,
including from five of the top 10 U.S. airlines, and carved out an
estimated 20 percent share of the world jetliner business,
competing against U.S. builders Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas
Corp., which dominate the industry.
   The treasuries of Britain, France and West Germany financed
development of two new Airbus models, but now the governments
believe it is time the consortium begins to function like a public
company.
   Clarke said the importance of the accord to overhaul Airbus
management structure is that ``Airbus will have to become a project
economically feasible on its own.''
   Croissier called Airbus Industrie ``by far the most succesful
European industrial cooperation project.''
   The so-called ``Four Wise Men's report'' the officials approved
Tuesday called for turning the Airbus consortium into a public
limited company by 1992; revamping the supervisory board to
increase policy control; and creating a financial director post to
account for program costs, profits and losses.

<HEAD>Canadian Buyer Nominates Federated Directors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. has proposed a slate of five
executives headed by Chairman Robert Campeau to become directors of
Federated Department Stores Inc. once Campeau takes over Federated.
   Federated, under its merger agreement with the Canadian company,
agreed to obtain the resignation of all but three of its current 17
directors once Campeau's tender offer for all of Federated's stock
is completed.
   Campeau's offer to pay all Federated stockholders $73.50 a share
is to expire at 5 p.m. April 20, but may be extended to May 12.
   The director changes would give Campeau control of five of the
eight seats remaining on the revamped Federated board. Campeau said
its slate of directors would act to complete the merger with
Federated as soon as possible following completion of the tender
offer.
   Besides Campeau, 63, founder of the Toronto-based development
company, the other Campeau nominees are: James T. Roddy, 45,
Campeau Corp.'s president and chief operating officer; Ronald
Tysoe, 45, Campeau senior vice president for corporate development;
Robert H. Morosky, 46, president of Campeau's Allied Stores Corp.
who will become chairman and chief executive of Federated and
Allied; and Carolyn Buck Luce, 35, senior vice president of Campeau
Corp. and Allied Stores.
   A Federated representative said no decision on which of the
current directors will resign would be made until Campeau takes
control of the company.
   At least two of the three Federated directors who remain on the
board will be picked from Federated's non-management directors,
according to Campeau's tender offer document sent to shareholders.
   Campeau's offering to shareholders also disclosed that on April
1, when Campeau said Federated reached the merger agreement,
Federated representatives estimated the company had lost $20
million before taxes during February. Campeau said that was higher
than the $10 million to $15 million loss Federated projected to
Campeau on Feb. 28 when they were negotiating a merger before New
York's R.H. Macy & Co. made a bid for Federated.
   Federated also projected that income before taxes for March and
April would be between $35 million and $76 million, Campeau said.
For the fiscal year ended Jan 30., Federated had net income of
$312.9 million, or $3.32 a share.

<HEAD>Societe Generale Shareholders To Vote On Takeover Thursday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Societe Generale de
Belgique SA meet Thursday to seal the fate of the company that is
older than Belgium and controls a third of its economy.
   The meeting also will decide the fate of the 3-month-old hostile
bid of Italian industrialist-financier Carlo De Benedetti, which
has bogged down in a swamp of legal, political and managerial
conflicts.
   De Benedetti's offer rocked the company, long home to the
blue-blooded cream of Belgium's business leaders and one in which
Belgian royalty and the Roman Catholic Church are said to have
shares.
   De Benedetti, head of Italy's Olivetti SpA, claims he and his
allies own as much as 49 percent of shares in 166-year-old Societe
Generale.
   His bid has spawned a rival alliance led by Cie. Financiere de
Suez of France and Groupe AG, Belgium's biggest insurer, that
claims a 50.7 percent stake.
   After months of conflicting statements and claims, the
extraordinary shareholders meeting which De Benedetti called must
show who owns what exactly.
   Analysts say the meeting may turn into a peace conference or a
showdown. ``Anything is possible,'' said Maurice Lippens, head of
Groupe AG.
   Some 1,000 shareholders and 200 journalists are to attend the
meeting in a specially built tent at the company's headoffice.
   Lippens has said De Benedetti must agree to share in management
of Societe Generale, not run it.
   But De Benedetti has said he seeks a free hand in Societe
Generale which has stakes in some 1,300 companies around the globe
active in just about every field of industrial endeavor.
   He wants to turn the company into a pan-European holding before
1992 when the European Economic Community is to remove borders
within the EEC and, with it, a thicket of regulatory restrictions.
   His search for control is entirely in character.
   Early in his career, De Benedetti, 53, left the board of Fiat
SpA when it was too slow in adopting his ideas for change. He went
to Olivetti whose fortunes he turned around after taking control of
the Italian office automation giant.
   The battle for Societe Generale has drawn companies from eight
nations into the fray in a hodge-podge of coalitions.
   France's Suez has a stake of 30 percent of the shares.
   Its main partner is Belgium's Groupe AG which only has a share
of 3.78 percent. In all, the AG-Suez camp totals a dozen or so
Belgian, French, Luxembourg and Swiss firms.
   De Benedetti's allies include Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc of the
United States and other U.S, Swiss and Australian finance companies.
   He has created a holding company for some of the shares in his
stable to attract major European companies. The Swiss food giant
Nestle SA has agreed to buy into it and Philips, the Dutch
communications and electronics company, may follow suit.
   The confrontation over Societe Generale is more than just
counting heads.
   For one thing, the target was long considered untouchable.
Societe Generale was founded 1822 by King William I of the
Netherlands, eight years before Belgium became independent of Dutch
rule and for years was Belgium's central bank.
   Today, its interests extend to mining, energy, financial
services, chemicals and engineering and its estimated worth is $3
billion.
   De Benedetti's bid led Societe Generale to isse 12 million new
shares. This has sparked several court cases which will likely take
years to produce a final settlement and adding confusion to a
takeover bid already riddled with complex alliances.
   Andre Leysen, head of Belgium's Gevaert Group, a one-time rival
but now an ally of De Benedetti, has called the saga ```Dallas,'
but without women,'' referring to the popular American television
series.

   Soybean futures closed lower Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as profit-taking erased some of last week's
dramatic gains. Corn futures also retreated while wheat advanced.
   Soybeans started the session on a weak note and slipped even
lower during the day but firmed near the end of trading to finish
down only a few cents.
   ``They came up fairly good on commercial buying,'' said Joel
Karlin, a research analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn futures retreated in sympathy with soybeans. Dim prospects
for corn exports and indications that the Agriculture Department
may move to make more surplus corn available on the open market
pressured corn futures, Karlin said.
   Wheat was supported by reports that China had bid for 500,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat offered under the USDA's subsidized
export sales program, and by indications that India is seeking to
buy U.S. wheat, he said.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 2} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.19 a bushel; corn was { cent to
1{ cents lower with May at $2.06\ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1\
cents lower with May at $1.66{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3{

   Harvard University was granted a patent for a
genetically altered mouse today, the first time a U.S. patent has
been issued for an animal.
   The laboratory mice were altered to make them more susceptible
to cancer, and have been in use in experiments at Harvard since
1984, said University spokeswoman Lilliam Blacker.
   Patent Commissioner Donald J. Quigg said using the animal will
simplify cancer research and make it easier to test both
cancer-causing substances and chemicals that fight cancer.
   The action drew fire from Jeremy Rifkin, who heads a coalition
of groups opposed to genetic engineering.
   He termed the action a usurpation of power by the Patent Office,
noting that there have been discussions in Congress of imposing a
moratorium on such patents until ethical questions can be worked
out.
   Quigg, however, said that the patent application, which was
filed in 1984, met the legal criteria for a patent, and so one was
issued. Ethical questions, he said, need to be settled in Congress
and the medical laboratories, not the Patent Office.
   While this was the first patent on an animal, plants and forms
of bacteria have been patented previously.
   The Supreme Court in 1980 ruled that man-made life organisms
could be patented, but the Harvard patent is the first to protect a
genetic change in a higher life form.
   The patent was issued to Harvard University, with the inventors
listed as Philip Leder and Timothy A. Stewart.
   Quigg said his office has 21 other applications for animal
patents pending. Details could not be disclosed, however, he said.
   He said that virtually any changed animal could be patented,
except humans.
   Patents allow the inventor the exclusive right to use a product
for 17 years, although in practice the patent holder usually
licenses use of the product for a fee.
   ``This opens the floodgates for a whole range of patents, from
fish to house pets,'' said Jack Doyle of the Environmental Policy
Institute, which supports a moratorium on animal patents.
   But Geoffrey Karny, a Washington patent attorney, said the
action was ``not a radical departure from existing policy.''
   ``Granting a patent on animals is an entirely logical
application of existing patent law principles, and in many respects
is nothing different from what society has been doing with regard
to the commercial ownership of animals for thousands of years.''

   Share prices ended slightly lower in thin,
featureless trading Tuesday, as investors awaited news from a
meeting of monetary officials of the Group of Seven major
industrialized nations.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 5.2
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,805.3 at the close.
   Volume was scant at 364.7 million shares, down from 405.4
million on Monday.
   Shares traded in positive territory for much of the day but fell
off in the afternoon on lack of buying interest.
   Prices also were weakened by market rumors, later denied, that
Tesco PLC, a major British supermarket chain, would launch a new
share issue Wednesday when it reports its 1987 earnings. Recently
announced share issues have depressed share values.
   Share prices got little help from the British pound's continued
retreat against both the U.S. dollar and the West German mark,
which boosted shares Monday.
   One dealer said, ``People are awaiting more news on the G-7
meeting,'' to take place Wednesday in conjunction with a meeting of
the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
   There was little corporate news to move the market. Among the
100-share index stocks, 58 were lower, 14 were unchanged and 28
showed gains.

<HEAD>Trump Rejects Griffin's Planned $105 Million Tender Offer for
Resorts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer-businessman Merv Griffin stepped
up the pressure Tuesday in his attempt to gain control of Resorts
International Inc., announcing he will make a $105 million tender
offer for a majority of the company's stock.
   New York investor Donald Trump, who controls 88 percent of the
hotel-casino operator's voting power, rejected the offer out of
hand, calling it ``a feeble and futile attempt to recast his prior
offers to further confuse the marketplace.''
   The $36-per-share offer to stockholders, to be initiated within
the next five days, follows Griffin's March 30 offer to management
to acquire all of Resorts' Class A common shares. The earlier offer
also is for $36 a share.
   ``Our new tender offer would effectively give Resorts' Class A
shareholders the opportunity to vote on Griffin's March 30 bid
now,'' said Michael Nigris, president of the Griffin Co.
   The offer would carry the condition that at least 2.9 million
shares be offered, a majority of the 5.7 million shares of Class A.
   Other conditions are that Resorts' board approve the merger and
that it agree to sell Griffin 1.2 million newly issued shares of
Class B stock for $36 a share. The Class B stock carries 100 votes
per share while the Class A carries one vote per share.
   The last condition, also part of Griffin's original offer, would
require the company to issue additional Class B stock and would
give him more voting strength than Trump. Trump owns 95 percent of
the 572,000 Class B shares that presently exist.
   In his response, Trump again made clear he has no intention of
sharing control of the company with Griffin, the former talk show
host who has built a private entertainment and real estate empire.
   ``Mr. Trump explained that Mr. Griffin's latest offer contained
nothing new and is still contingent upn Mr. Trump's aproval, an
approval which will never be granted,'' his news release said.
   A special committee of Resorts' management met with a Griffin
representative Friday to discuss his efforts to buy the company,
but resolved nothing, said Harvey Freeman, executive vice president
of the Trump organization and a director of Resorts.

   The stock market advanced to a post-crash high
today in a late wave of buying spurred by computerized trading, a
firmer dollar and rebounding bond prices.
   The Dow Jones industrial average surged to close firmly above
the 2,100 mark for the first time since the market collapsed almost
six months ago.
   Analysts noted the Dow average had flirted with the
psychological barrier on several recent occasions, but investors
shed their inhibitions when the key market barometer held above
that level in mid-afternoon.
   Stock prices were mixed earlier in the session and the market
appeared to lack direction despite its sound underpinnings. Many
investors sat on the sidelines awaiting fresh economic data due out
later this week.
   Those who were waiting for new statistics from the Commerce
Department, scheduled to release February's merchandise trade data
on Thursday, missed the market's latest uptick, analysts said.
   ``A lot of people are going to play it close to the vest until
they see some direction from the numbers coming out,'' said Peter
Vandenberg, a vice president at Smith Barney, Harris, Upham & Co.
   Analysts also noted, however, that volume remained extremely
light, initially indicating a lack of investor enthusiasm but then
serving to accentuate the move upward once buyers did step in.

   International Paper Co. said Tuesday its
first-quarter profit jumped 76.7 percent as revenue rose 27.8
percent, reflecting strong demand for all of its major products.
   The company said it earned $159 million, or $1.38 a share, in

cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first quarter rose to $2.3 billion from $1.8
billion in 1987.
   John A. Georges, chairman and chief executive, said prices for
most of the company's products are ``holding firm or increasing.''
   ``Demand across our major products lines _ white papers, coated
papers, containerboard, bleached board, pulp and lumber _ remains
strong,'' he said.
   He said the sales increase also reflected the benefits of recent
acquisitions, and that earnings should continue to improve from
last year if the economy remains strong.

<HEAD>Batus Says It Will Raise Stock Offer Price</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Batus Inc. told the
nation's third largest home and auto insurer Tuesday his company is
ready to open friendly merger talks and boost its $4.35 billion
takeover offer.
   Patrick Sheehy made the proposal in a letter sent to
representatives of the Farmers Group Inc., which is based in Los
Angeles. On Monday, Farmers Group had indicated that it is willing
to open talks with Batus under certain conditions.
   In over-the-counter trading, Farmers Group edged up 12{ cents a
share to close at $65 a share.
   Sheehy said the Louisville-based Batus, a subsidiary of the
British retailing, tobacco and financial services concern BAT
Industries PLC, was prepared to pay more than its current bid of
$63 per share ``in a friendly negotiated transaction.''
   Farmers Group had about 69.7 million shares of common stock
outstanding as of April 1. Batus already owns 696,000 shares of
Farmers stock, putting the value of its offer for the stock it does
not own at $4.35 billion.
   Sheehy also said Batus would like to receive the same
confidential information that Farmers had made available to other
parties.
   Sheehy asked, however, that the confidentiality agreement be
modified to ensure ``that there would be no unreasonable
restrictions on the freedom of Batus to pursue its offer if
negotiations failed, and that a fully level playing field would be
established between Batus and any other potential acquirer.''
   Tom Welch, director of corporate investments for Farmers, said
``the next step will be for our attorneys to look over their
request for a modification of the agreement. Then, we will respond
to them but I don't know when that will be.''
   Farmers has scheduled its annual meeting for May 20.
   The company has been resisting overtures from Batus' overtures
but altered its position Monday in a letter from Leo E. Denlea Jr.,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Denlea said the board of directors would consider a bid from
Batus only if ``you are prepared to state unequivocally that Batus
is, in fact, prepared to offer a higher price and, if so, what that
price is. I am requesting hereby that you advise us without delay
of any higher offer you are prepared to make.''
   Denlea's letter also offered to share confidential information
disclosed to other potential suitors if Batus agreed to
confidentiality guidelines.
   ``You should be aware that at this point, Farmers' board of
directors has made no decision to pursue a sale of the company,''
Denlea wrote. ``That possibility is, as you may expect, under
continuous review. Depending on your response to the request made
herein, and other circumstances, the board of directors may or may
not revise its decision.''
   Batus, with businesses in retail sales, tobacco and paper goods,
made an unsolicited $63-a-share offer for Farmers on March 3. Last
week, Sheehy said the company would consider increasing its offer
if Farmers management would agree to negotiate.
   BAT has been seeking a foothold in the U.S. financial services
market for some time.

<HEAD>Dollar Steadies in Quiet Trading; Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in quiet trading Tuesday as
foreign exchange markets waited for a key finance ministers'
meeting and the release of U.S. trade deficit figures.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid of $450.20 for a troy ounce of gold, down 50
cents from $450.70 Monday.
   Traders said there was little foreign exchange activity in
advance of Wednesday's meeting of finance ministers from the seven
major industrialized countries and the release of U.S. trade
figures for February on Thursday.
   In the meantime, the dollar was ``holding up very well, going
nowhere,'' said Ted Wolicki, a trader with Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago.
   The finance ministers are expected to discuss the dollar. West
German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said they are
likely to reaffirm December's agreement on economic-policy
cooperation and the stabilization of exchange rates.
   The trade figures are considered key to the dollar's direction
because the Reagan administration has supported a lower dollar as a
way to cut the trade deficit. When the dollar is down, imports are
more expensive, but U.S. goods become cheaper overseas.
   Dan Holland, a trader at Discount Corp., said the dollar also
was boosted partly by technical factors, but also spurted upward on
the news that a U.S. marine had been shot and killed in Panama.
Traders consider the dollar a safe haven during times of political
uncertainty.
   In London, the British pound declined to $1.8515 from $1.8560
late Monday. In later New York trading, the pound fell to $1.8468
from $1.86075.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.68945 West German marks, up from 1.68115;
1.39875 Swiss francs, up from 1.3914; 5.7255 French francs, up from
5.71375; 1,275.375 Italian lire, up from 1,246.45; and 1.23705
Canadian dollars, down from 1.24015.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.6853 West German marks, down from 1.6855; 1.3967
Swiss francs, up from 1.3953; 5.7165 French francs, up from 5.7145;
1.8890 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8910; 1,249.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,249.50; and 1.2370 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2390.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 126.50 Japanese yen from
125.71 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, the dollar was
quoted at 126.49 yen, and in New York, it rose to 126.685 yen from
126.175 yen.
   The price of gold bullion fell on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, where it closed at $450.90 a troy ounce, compared with
$452.80 late Monday.
   Gold rose in thin trading in London to a late bid price of $451
an ounce, up from a bid of $449.50 late Monday. In Zurich, gold
also rose to $451 an ounce, up from $449 bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $452.21 an
ounce from $451.95 at Monday's close.
   Silver bullion closed at $6.425 a troy ounce on the New York
Comex, down from late Monday's $6.444. Silver rose earlier in
London to a bid price of $6.45 an ounce from $6.42 bid late Monday.

   The stock market hit a post-crash high Tuesday
in its sixth straight advance, helped by a late wave of
computerized buying.
   The Dow Jones industrial average surged to close firmly above
the 2,100 mark for the first time since the stock market collapsed
almost six months ago. Computer-triggered buy programs, a firmer
dollar and rebounding bond prices all were credited with spurring
the advance.
   The Dow average of 30 industrials jumped 14.09 points to
2,110.08, bringing its gain in the week-old rally to a total of
about 130 points. Broader market gauges also moved upward.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 879 up, 621 down and 471 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 140.40 million shares, against 146.37
million shares in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index
gained 0.72 to 153.19.
   Analysts noted that volume remained extremely light, initially
indicating a lack of investor enthusiasm but then serving to
accentuate the move upward once buyers stepped in.
   Stocks were mixed early in the session, and the market appeared
to lack direction.
   The Dow average tentatively touched 2,100 around noon but
quickly retreated. It was not until the key market barometer held
above that level in mid-afternoon that investors discarded their
inhibitions over equities.
   ``When the Dow went above 2,100 decisively, it attracted new
buyers,'' said Michael Metz, a vice president and technical analyst
with Oppenheimer & Co.
   The 2,100 mark had become somewhat of a psychological barrier.
The Dow average flirted with that level on several recent
occasions, but investors seemed reluctant to make it stick.
   ``A lot of market watchers are getting nervous that they missed
something on the upside,'' Metz said referring to the many
investors who sat on the sidelines awaiting fresh economic data due
out later this week.
   ``A lot of people have missed this move,'' he said.
   Some inactive investors hoped the Commerce Department's release
of February's merchandise trade data on Thursday would lend clues
to the state of the economy.
   Many were playing it ``close to the vest until they see some
direction from the numbers coming out,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris, Upham & Co.
   Besides the trade figures, retail sales figures were due out
Wednesday, the same day the so-called Group of Seven industrialized
nations was set to hold a meeting that could have implications for
the dollar.
   Among actively traded issues, Honda Motor was the exception in
an otherwise lackluster auto sector, jumping 4 to 147{.
   Aircraft issues were mixed. Boeing was unchanged at 47]. The
Federal Aviation Administration said it would conduct an
investigation into alleged defects in the some of the company's
wide-body jets.
   Electronic issues were mostly higher, with Honeywell up 1] to
70; Kyocera up 2\ to 90, and Matsushita up 3] to 226~.
   Oil stocks were widely higher, with Chevron up 1{ to 50}, Mobil
up 1[ to 49[ and Atlantic Richfield up 1[ to 90]. Oil prices hit a
four-month high in the second day of a rally inspired by OPEC
efforts to rein in supplies.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $12.47 billion, or
0.47 percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 171.75 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.45 to 316.16,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.21 to 271.37.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.90
to 306.59. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 383.38, up 0.86.

<HEAD>Ex-Salesman Presses Effort To Become President Of US Sprint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY NACHTIGAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WESTWOOD, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top salesman for US Sprint
Communications Co. told stockholders of one of the company's parent
corporations Tuesday that US Sprint is rife with mismanagement and
he should become its president.
   Paul Walton, who last year received a $1.74 million settlement
from US Sprint over unpaid commissions, said US Sprint's management
is ``totally out of touch'' with the telecommunications industry.
   ``Management's thinking is years behind the times,'' Walton said
in an interview following the annual meeting of United
Telecommunications Inc. of Westwood, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo.
   United Telecom is joint owner of US Sprint with GTE Corp. of
Stamford, Conn.
   Walton, a 32-year-old former school teacher from San Diego, has
campaigned from college campuses to Wall Street in an attempt to
oust Robert Snedaker as president of US Sprint. He's also calling
attention to billing problems that have plagued the company since
its formation in 1986.
   Because US Sprint's president is not elected but is chosen by a
six-member partnership committee of United Telecom and GTE, Walton
wants shareholders to pressure company officials to put him in
charge.
   Walton got a cool reception from the approximately 200 people
attending the meeting.
   ``I think he means well but Sprint is showing signs of coming
around,'' said Marvin Bell of Lenexa, Kan., a shareholder. ``What
he's saying really isn't an issue any more.''
   US Sprint, based in Kansas City, Mo., is the nation's
third-largest long-distance telephone company behind American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp.
   US Sprint lost $1.1 billion last year on revenues of $3.1
billion. Analysts have predicted that the company would lose from
$115 million to $140 million in the quarter that ended March 31.
   William T. Esrey, United Telecom's president and chief executive
officer, conceded Tuesday that US Sprint's losses for the first
quarter of 1988 likely would be more than the $116 million loss in
the last quarter of 1987.
   US Sprint probably won't turn a profit in 1988 but its losses
should decline in 1988, Esrey said. He told stockholders that US
Sprint's fiber-optic long-distance telephone network and other
technological advancements would boost its share of the market and
help trim losses.
   Esrey also said the billing problems _ some customers weren't
billed for months or have been charged for calls they didn't make _
have been cleared up.
   However, Walton, who was fired in July 1986 after sending a
letter to Esrey complaining about customer service and not
receiving commissions on some of the 600,000 Sprint accounts he had
signed up, challenged Esrey's remarks.
   ``Everywhere I go, people come up to me and tell me horror
stories about US Sprint,'' he said. ``Their service hasn't been
connected, they don't receive bills, they're billed for calls they
don't make or a collection agency is after them because of
company-caused errors. There's just no excuse.''
   Esrey declined to comment on Walton's charges, but agreed with
Walton that the price of the company's stock should be higher.
   Walton said he also will appear at GTE's stockholders' meeting
April 20.
   Walton and his supporters have handed out T-shirts, buttons and
bumper stickers promoting his candidacy, which he expects to cost
$60,000.
   ``It's clear that they don't know the best ways of running the
company,'' he said. ``I'm willing to roll up my sleeves and work
18-hour days, seven days a week, like I once did for this company.
We need a change in management, change in direction and an
entrepreneurial approach.''

<HEAD>Pork Belly Futures Plummet; High Supply Levels Cited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices surged for the second straight day Tuesday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, closing above the $18-a-barrel barrier
for the first time in four months.
   In other markets, frozen pork bellies plunged the limit allowed
for daily trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; livestock
futures fell; copper futures fell sharply and precious metals
retreated slightly; grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index
futures moved higher.
   Crude futures were supported by unconfirmed rumors that the
trans-Panama pipeline would be shut down and by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries' recent moves to reduce world oil
output, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil, up a sharp $1.01 a barrel on
Monday, settled 19 cents to 20 cents higher with May at $18.09 a
barrel. It was the first time oil for the near-month contract
closed over $18 since a Dec. 11 close of $18.31.
   Heating oil was 1.03 cents to 1.32 cents higher with May at
48.91 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .75 cent to 1.12 cents
higher with May at 52.07 cents a gallon.
   Frozen pork belly futures plunged on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, in a selloff sparked by a continuing unusually high
amount of bellies in cold storage.
   Large amounts of pork bellies have been moved into cold storage
due to weak demand by bacon producers, and pessimistic traders
expected a report issued after Tuesday's close to show the trend
continuing, analysts said.
   The Merc's weekly report on out-of-town storage showed more than
68 million pounds of pork bellies stored in freezers outside of
Chicago compared with about 21.9 million pounds a year ago. The
figure represented an increase of about 2 million pounds during the
past week.
   Traders, expecting an increase of 2.5 million to 3.2 million
pounds, had bid the contracts for May and July delivery down the
daily limit of 2 cents a pound.
   Selling in pork bellies spread to hog futures, which finished
significantly lower. Cattle futures slumped in response to slack
demand on cash markets, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .52 cent to 1.25 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in April at 74.75 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .65 cent to 1.20 cents lower with April at 80.02 cents
a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .75 cent lower with April at 54.65
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 2 cents lower
with May at 53.02 cents a pound.
   Copper prices fell for a second straight day on New York's
Commodity Exchange, with all contracts settling below $1 a pound
for the first time since March 8. The contract for May delivery
plunged 4.55 cents, settling at 95.65 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures retreated slightly, responding to the
stronger dollar, said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Gold settled $1 to $1.90 lower with June at $453.70 a troy ounce
and May silver fell 4.5 cents to at $6.425 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures closed lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as
profit-taking erased some of last week's sharp gains. Corn futures
retreated in sympathy with soybeans, while wheat rose on reports
that China and India were seeking to buy U.S. wheat under the
government's subsidized export sales program, said Joel Karlin, a
research analyst for Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 2} cents higher with May at $3.20\ a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $2.06\
a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $1.66{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with May at $6.79\
a bushel.
   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 1.35 points higher at 272.55. The underlying spot
index closed 1.21 points higher at 271.37.

   Hilton Hotels Corp. reported
Tuesday that first-quarter earnings rose 15 percent, paced by
strong performances in both hotel and gambling operations.
   Net profit for the quarter was $27.6 million, or $1.15 per
share, up from $24.0 million, or 96 cents a share in the first
quarter of 1987, the company reported. Revenues for the quarter
ended March 31 were $214.2 million, up from $201.2 million for the
same period in 1987.
   Per-share earnings rose more than net earnings because the
company bought back 1.1 million shares.
   Chairman and President Barron Hilton said hotel revenues were up
12 percent, attributing the gain to completion of large renovation
projects. Gambling revenues also rose 12 percent because of
improved performances at the Las Vegas Hilton and Flamingo Hilton,
he said.

<HEAD>Social Security Surpluses Said Hiding True Extent of Fiscal 1989
Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New in first 6 new grafs with Senate vote on amendment; picks

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fiscal 1989 budget hides the true size of
the federal deficit because it factors in huge surpluses from the
Social Security system and other programs, senators said Tuesday
while considering the $1.1 trillion spending plan.
   By an 85-8 vote, the Senate gave preliminary approval to an
amendment to the budget urging the lawmakers to discount the
surpluses amassed by two funds set aside for highway and aviation
projects when calculating the federal deficit.
   The two funds have a combined projected surplus of $2 billion
for next year.
   The Senate budget blueprint officially predicts the deficit
problem is easing.
   But under an amendment offered by Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.,
chairman of the budget committee, the mammoth surplus the Social
Security program accumulates each year would no longer be counted
when figuring the federal deficit. That amendment could be voted on
as early as Wednesday.
   ``The deficit is heading up, not down,'' said Chiles.
   The Senate budget, which Chiles helped write, predicts the red
ink will shrink to $136 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1, a drop of more than $10 billion from the amount anticipated in
the current fiscal year.
   However, that counts a $46 billion surplus in Social Security,
which is expected to grow even larger through the beginning of the
next century. The funds then would be expended when the Baby Boom
generation reaches retirement age.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said that even if the Congress and
president meet their promise under the Gramm-Rudman law for a
balanced budget by fiscal 1993, the deficit that year actually
would be more than $100 billion if the Social Security surplus
isn't counted.
   Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., said he thought the amendment was an
inadequate gesture and that major revisions of the federal
accounting system were needed, not just non-binding legislative
language.
   There was less debate about the substance of the budget, which
would carry out the mandate of last fall's deficit-reduction
agreement between President Reagan and congressional leaders.
   The spending plan, like the agreement, calls for $294 billion in
military spending, $16.1 billion for foreign assistance and $169.2
billion for domestic agencies, outside of entitlements and other
programs set by automatic formulas.
   The Senate plan features a 27 percent increase in spending on
the space program and big boosts in AIDS research, both requested
by Reagan. Education would receive $1.2 billion, a 7.4 percent
boost.
   Like the president's plan, the budget doesn't call for new taxes
beyond the $14 billion for fiscal 1988 which was enacted last
December.
   The Senate plan also calls for:
   _A 4.3 percent pay increase for the military and 2 percent for
civilian federal workers. Reagan had requested the different pay
boosts, but the House voted for 3 percent across the board.
   _$500 million for more farm commodities for the poor, to replace
exhausted surplus stocks.
   _Expansion of Medicaid health program and enactment of Medicare
catastrophic illness insurance, assuming fees raised to pay for
them.
   _An 11 percent increase for National Science Foundation for its
research programs and a 25 percent increase in Energy Department
nuclear physics program, toward development of the superconducting
super collider project.
   _A 3 percent cut in rural housing assistance, along with
reductions in elderly housing and community and regional
development.
   _Aviation safety increase of 19 percent from $5.5 billion this
year, to hire 900 more air traffic controllers and modernize the
system.
   The House budget, approved last month, also follows the overall
budget guidelines of last fall but it differs in detail from the
Senate plan. For example, the House voted to spend more on aid to
local communities and less on space than the Senate plan.
   The two chambers must agree on a single spending plan, after
which it serves as a guide for regular fiscal legislation. The
budget is a congressional resolution that does not require the
president's signature.
   The official deadline for completing the budget is Friday.
Although Congress is unlikely to meet that target, this year's
budget action is coming at the earliest dates in years.

<HEAD>Pepperell Overall Earnings Down, Continuing Operations Income Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc. reported
Tuesday its net income declined 2.1 percent in its second quarter,
although income from continuing operations rose 22.4 percent.
   The West Point-based company, which is involved in a
billion-dollar bidding war for rival textile giant J.P. Stevens &
Co., reported net income of $15.3 million, or 51 cents per share,
in the quarter ended March 26. That compared with a profit of $15.6
million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $459.9 million, up 12 percent from
$410.4 million in the year-earlier quarter.
   Income from continuing operations rose to $18.6 million from
$15.2 million a year earlier.
   Joseph L. Lanier Jr, chairman and chief executive officer,
stated the rise in operating earnings stemmed from solid sales
increases in knit apparel fabrics and in the company's bed and bath
lines and from lower tax rates in 1988.
   Lanier said the company had an after-tax charge of $3.3 million
against a gain on the sale of discontinued carpet operations. West
Point sold substantially all of its assets of its carpet and rug
division last November to Shaw Industries Inc.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Pepperell reported
net income of $40.9 million, up 11.8 percent from the previous
period's $36.6 million. Per-share earnings rose to $1.34 from $1.25
in the previous quarter.
   Sales for the first half were $940.9 million, up 12.9 percent
from $833.1 million a year earlier.
   Pepperell is dueling with Odyssey Partners for control of J.P.
Stevens. New York-based Stevens has entered a merger agreement with
Odyssey, an investment group, but Pepperell has continued bidding
for the company. Odyssey on Monday offered $1.22 billion for
Stevens, topping Pepperell's $1.19 billion bid made earlier in the
day.
   Lanier has said Pepperell may consider topping Odyssey's latest
price.

<HEAD>Greenspan: Banking Reserves Must Be Increased To Handle Global
Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hazards of deregulated banking on a
global scale demand that banks increase their reserves, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday.
   Greenspan said the need for bigger bank reserves was underscored
last year when major banks took big losses because of reserves set
aside to cover bad loans to Latin America. For some banks, those
moves erased most of a decade's worth of growth in their capital
reserves.
   Such losses might be digested by healthy banks in a stable
domestic economy, Greenspan said. But the volatile nature of
international lending and increasing bank involvement in real
estate, insurance and securities brokering demanded a bigger safety
net, he told the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.
   Last December, federal banking officials and supervisory
officials from the 10 largest industrialized nations jointly
proposed establishing uniform international capital requirements.
   The plan would set an internationally accepted minimum equity
capital requirement and a menu of acceptable non-traditional assets
that could supplement a bank's equity base.
   Greenspan said the plan should be viewed as a crude first step
in focusing attention on the need for additional reserves.
   ``Some revisions may be required over time, but it provides an
important base to allow bank organizations to adapt in years
ahead,'' Greenspan said.

<HEAD>Western Union To Cut More Than 1,800 Workers In Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Union Corp. will lay off
about 1,800 workers, some 25 percent of its work force, by the end
of this year as part of its financial restructuring, the company
said Tuesday.
   Robert J. Amman, president and chief executive officer, also
said the company had established five separate business units under
the restructuring.
   Western Union's restructuring plan, completed Dec. 30, included
the $178 million acquisition of ITT World Communications Inc., an
exchange of debt for stock and the borrowing of about $500 million
through the sale of high-interest debentures.
   The plan was aimed at helping keep the communications company
afloat after years of major financial losses. Western Union
officials have said that without the restructuring the company
would have had to file for bankruptcy protection.
   The layoffs will affect workers in all parts of the combined
company, spokesman Warren Bechtel said.
   Amman said in a news release that the creation of separate
business units, to operate on a stand-alone basis, and the
integration of ITT World Communications into Western Union ``are
the first steps in implementing our strategic plan to make the
company more profitable.''
   The business largest unit, business communications services,
oversees the company's international and domestic telex and
electronic mail service.
   Money transfer services and mailgram and telegram message
services are handled by another division. The consumer
communications and financial services unit will coordinate the
nationwide network of 11,000 Western Union agents and the company's
centralized telephone bureaus.
   A third division, priority mail services, is responsible for
commercial mailgram messages, priority letters and computer letters
to business and special interest groups.
   Western Union's advanced transmission systems supervises
construction and operation of local and regional fiber optic
transmission facilities for corporate customers and other
communications carriers.
   The fifth unit is responsible for national marketing of Western
Union's long distance and leased transmission servicees, along with
the company's international leased line business and satellite
service.
   Western Union earned $88.1 million in 1987 on revenue of $802
million, Bechtel said.
