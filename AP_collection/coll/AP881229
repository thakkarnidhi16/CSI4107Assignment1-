   Japan's newly appointed justice minister resigned
Friday under a barrage of criticism for accepting political
donations from a company at the center of a major scandal.
   ``There is nothing wrong with politicians accepting donations
made from the good will of their supporters,'' Takashi Hasegawa told
reporters at the Justice Ministry. ``However, as minister in charge
of clearing up the Recruit problem in the Takeshita administration,
which is trying to heighten trust in government, it is regrettable
that I received donations from Recruit.
   ``I apologize deeply and resign from my post as justice
minister.''
   Kyodo News Service said Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita accepted
the resignation. Just Tuesday, Takeshita chose Hasegawa to handle a
probe of a stock-profiteering scandal involving influential
politicians and business leaders and the Recruit Co.
   The secretary general of Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party,
Shintaro Abe, said the administration may look outside government to
replace Hasegawa. He said a new minister probably would be named
before the weekend.
   Takeshita reshuffled his Cabinet on Tuesday in a move to rid his
administration of any links to the scandal involving the purchase of
unlisted stocks by a select number of individuals.
   On Thursday, Takeshita told Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi
to look into the history of other new Cabinet members' ties to
Recruit Co., an information and publishing conglomerate at the
center of the scandal.
   Kyodo said Obuchi also accepted donations from Recruit. Two other
new Cabinet members have acknowledged that Recruit bought tickets
for their fund-raising parties.
   Opposition party leaders had demanded Takeshita fire Hasegawa and
said the prime minister should take responsibility for appointing
Hasegawa without checking whether he had ties with Recruit.
   ``Appointing a person related to the Recruit scandal as justice
minister, who is in charge of investigation into the scandal, is out
of the question. It is not something they can get away by saying
they did not know,'' said Mitsuhiro Kaneko, head of the Japan
Communist Party's secretariat.
   Influential politicians and business leaders were offered
bargain-priced shares in Recruit-Cosmos, a Recruit real estate
subsidiary, before they were listed for public sale. Share prices
rose sharply after their public offering, and some shareholders made
more than $80,000 in tax-free profits.
   Former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa heads the roster of 17
politicians and business leaders who resigned earlier in the
scandal. A former Recruit official pleaded guilty to trying to bribe
an opposition Parliament member to tone down his investigation.
   But Hasegawa's and Obuchi's reported links with Recruit differed
from the other cases.
   The day after Hasegawa's appointment, it was disclosed that his
political support organization received $46,000 in membership dues
from Recruit over 12 years. The latest donation of $3,800 came in
October, about three months after the Recruit scandal erupted.
   On Thursday, Takeshita said Hasegawa told him that accepting
membership fees from Recruit ``lacked prudence, and I fully agree
with him.'' But Takeshita added, ``I believe his ability will allow
him to fulfill his responsibility as justice minister.''
   The prime minister said earlier Hasegawa would play a key role in
promoting reform in political ethics and that Hasegawa was the best
man for the job.
   Hasegawa, 76, told a news conference Thursday he was ``truly
careless'' in not knowing about the donations, but ``as justice
minister I don't think this matter will be an impediment.''
   Hasegawa first denied allegations about the donations, and then
said they were made without his knowledge. But his son and
secretary, Akira Hasegawa, said he told his father about the
donations as early as October.
   In forming his new Cabinet on Tuesday, Takeshita sought to put
the Recruit scandal behind him.
   But critics link Takeshita himself to the scandal since one of
his aides profited from sales of bargain Recruit shares. The prime
minister has denied any personal involvement.
   Kyodo said Obuchi's support organization has been receiving $160
a month from Recruit, although it was not known for how long.
   It said Obuchi's only comment was, ``We have been complying with
the law in handling political donations.''
   Tsutomu Hata, the new agriculture minister, acknowledged that
Recruit bought tickets for his fund-raising party in 1986, but did
not disclose the amount.
   Another new Cabinet official, Ken Harada, director general of the
Economic Planning Agency, acknowledged he received donations from
Recruit for more than 10 years and that Recruit has bought tickets
for his fund-raising parties.
   Like the stock transactions, the political donations were legal.
But critics contend the stock deals were unethical and were
donations in disguise.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, general secretary of the largest opposition
party, the Socialists, had demanded Hasegawa's resignation.

   A quick-spreading outbreak of Chinese flu has ruined
the holidays for tens of thousands of Italians, filled hospitals and
clinics, and left many doctors sick in bed, Italian newspapers
report.
   The outbreak surprised health officials, who had predicted the
annual flu season would begin in January, according to news reports
Wednesday.
   While health officials do not consider this year's virus, which
they think originated in Chinese pigs, to be more severe than recent
types, its timing has caused numerous problems.
   Throughout Italy, family doctors, understaffed emergency rooms
and clinics were unprepared for the onslaught of people seeking
relief from the virus, which is considered dangerous only to infants
and the elderly. There have been no reports of deaths in Italy from
the flu.
   In Rome, weekend calls to the city's main emergency center poured
in at almost twice the normal rate. An estimated 15 percent of the
city's doctors and 35 percent of its nurses were unable to work,
mostly due to the virus.
   Health officials in Bologna estimate that about 20,000 citizens
remain in bed with symptoms of the flu, which include high fever,
aching joints and the chills.
   Doctors have said the flu normally lasts three days and should be
treated with rest, fluids, aspirin and vitamin C.

<TEXT>
   The Picasso Museum, home for the past three years to
nearly 3,500 works by Pablo Picasso, is closing to the public for
two months for repairs, a museum spokesman said.
   The refurbished 17th century mansion, known as the Hotel Sale
after one of its former owners, opened as a museum in 1985 with the
world's largest collection of works by the Spanish master who died
in 1973.
   The 203 paintings, 158 sculptures and 3,000 drawings were taken
by the French government from Picasso's heirs in lieu of death
taxes, along with works by Matisse, Cezanne, Braque and Renoir in
the artist's private collection.
   A spokesman said Wednesday that the repairs involved replacing
the building's stone floors, which had proven ``too porous and
fragile,'' to handle traffic from some 40,000 visitors monthly.
   The museum closes Saturday and reopens March 1.

   Ignore the wheelchair and arthritis.
Her 80 years weigh lightly upon the mind and wit of M.F.K. Fisher,
whose gifts to the world of food and literature are still mounting.
   But shed a tear for the grand dame of gastronomy: Mary Frances
Kennedy Fisher denies herself the pleasure she gives her army of
admirers in the 17 books and scores of magazine pieces that for 50
years set a lean and spicy standard few can match.
   ``I never read anything I've written,'' she snapped. ``I don't
care to go back. I never read a word of print about me or by me.''
   She wouldn't argue with going back to being able to use her hands
for typing. Fate has ruled that she must dictate into a tape
recorder. There's no question of her not doing it. Writing is as
important to her as air.
   ``I am compulsive about it,'' admitted the Michigan-born author,
who wrote such tasty morsels as ``How to Cook a Wolf,'' ``The
Gastronomical Me,'' ``Consider the Oyster'' and her pungent
``Alphabet for Gourmets.''
   Chafing among cushions in her little wine-country house, she
added, ``But it's like pulling teeth. It's just awful. I can't
dictate to a person so I dictate secretly. I don't make many
mistakes, you know. It's my newspaper training. ... I don't have any
errors once I get it down on paper, thank God.''
   In 1937, the world's food writers discovered a tough new kid on
the block when they eyed this paragraph leaping from the pages of
``Serve It Forth,'' Mary Frances' first book:
   ``The quails are an artful lure to the most refined of palates,
and the rabbit stew, steaming, aromatic, is made just as tempting
with an onion or two, pepper freshly ground, a little bacon and a
dash of cheap, pure wine.''
   A somewhat less literate reporter observed, ``It's a shame you
don't get to read your good stuff like that.'' She was not
impressed. Others are. It was once said of her crisp prose:
   ``She writes about food as others do about love, but rather
better. ... Fisher writes not as a specialist but as a whole human
being, spiky with prejudices, charming, short-tempered,
well-traveled and cosmopolitan. ... She is a person, not a gourmet
masked as a writer. Her passion comes from inside her.''
   That was 35 years ago. Except for such indignities as two hip
replacements, a corneal implant and the arthritis, nothing has
changed, and she remembers everything between times _ three
husbands, magazine pieces, the books that ``never made me any
money,'' the travels in Europe.
   Of all her mates, said Mary Frances, ``my real husband was Jimmy
Parrish (Dillwyn Parrish).'' They lived in a stone house surrounded
by a vineyard and garden in Vevey, Switzerland.
   It was there, she said, that she learned from her Italian Swiss
neighbors to cook vegetables in their own juices ``with sweet butter
or thick olive oil to encourage them a little; tomatoes and onions
and sweet peppers and all the summer things.''
   She credits her start in food-writing on an episode during
prohibition when she was living in Whittier, Calif., and her
newspaperman father, Rex Kennedy, was teaching at a nearby college.
She was working in a postcard shop. One afternoon she had a half-day
off and decided to go the public library, where she found an
Elizabethan cookbook on a table.
   ``It smelled so good ... the binding. I started writing,'' she
said.
   She showed her writing to Alfred Fisher, the man who became her
first husband. She had just turned 21 when they married, and 11 days
later they set off to France and three years in Dijon, where he got
his doctorate and she earned a degree at the University of Dijon.
   Back in the states, her writing started making the rounds. At 26,
she sold her first magazine story, ``The Standing and the Waiting,''
and it conjured visions, full of verbs and wide swaths of color. The
most scholarly of her work is her translation of legendary
gastronomer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin's ``The Physiology of
Taste,'' her favorite work.
   Smoothing her red polka-dot dress, she peered out the window of
the small, busy house she has lived in for 18 years, craning to see
who was coming to visit her next. They come all day long, for a few
moments in her ``youthful'' presence. They come professionally or as
friends, for interviews, a publisher's conference, a chat, advice or
perhaps to drop off a particularly nice piece of cheese or share a
plateful of the chincoteague oysters she loves so much.
   She calls her visitors ``strays and wayfarers.'' They sit with
her near a large picture window in her Sonoma County house on the
edge of the old Bouverie Ranch, in Jack London country.
   But in her eighth decade, Mary Frances is not overwhelmed with
the way things have gone with the world.
   ``We're suicidal,'' declared the mother of two daughters. ``Our
doom is sealed. I take a very dim view of us as a human race, the
only one that kills itself and everything around it. ... We've
poisoned the earth and the land and the water. What else is there to
poison? ... I don't have any hope for us at all.''
   We looked out on her green meadow, rolling to the trees,
peaceful, and the harsh pronouncement seemed a long way away.

   A dozen environmentalists protesting
East bloc air pollution erected two tents on the East German side of
the border as Communist border guards watched without intervening,
West German police said.
   Police said the activists staged the protest Wednesday just
inside East Germany near where West Germany, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia meet.
   The environmentalists contend East German and Czechoslovak
authorities are too lax in enforcing air pollution laws, resulting
in harmful emissions that affect air quality in West Germany as well.
   Twelve of them erected two tents just inside the East German
frontier, but outside the fence that separates the two countries.
They also released balloons with slogans such as ``Pollution knows
no borders.''
   West German police said East German border guards watched the
developments from a distance, but did not intervene. Czechoslovak
sentries also watched from their side of the border.
   Five other environmentalists stayed on West German territory as
the protest continued late Wednesday.

   The Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an estimated
55,000 people brought tragedy and sorrow to countless Armenians. But
it also was a time for bravery. Here is one woman's story of her
fight to save the life of her child, as they lay buried alive for
eight days.

   Mother and daughter were entombed in
eternal night and their only food, a jar of jam, was gone. Tons of
smashed concrete around them had become their prison. ``Mommy, I'm
so thirsty, I want to drink,'' cried the 4-year-old girl.
   Susanna Petrosyan said she was trapped flat on her back. A
prefabricated concrete panel 18 inches above her head and a crumpled
water pipe above her shoulders kept her from standing. She wore only
a slip, and it was horribly cold.
   Beside her in the darkness lay the lifeless body of her
sister-in-law, Karine. She had been crushed by falling walls, and
died pinned beneath rubble one day after the Dec. 7 earthquake
leveled much of Leninakan and other towns in northwestern Armenia.
   ``Mommy, I need to drink,'' sobbed Mrs. Petrosyan's daughter,
Gayaney. ``Please give me something.''
   ``I thought my child was going to die of thirst,'' Mrs.
Petrosyan, 26, recalled. ``I had no water, no fruit juice, no
liquids. It was then I remembered that I had my own blood.''
   Although she was trapped in darkness, she could slide on her back
from side to side. Her groping fingers, numb from the cold, found a
shattered glass. She sliced open her left index finger with a shard
and gave it to her daughter to suckle.
   The drops of blood weren't enough. ``Please, Mommy, some more.
Cut another finger,'' Mrs. Petrosyan remembers her daughter saying.
The woman made more cuts in her flesh, feeling nothing because of
the bitter cold. She put her hand to her child's mouth, squeezing
her fingers to make more blood come.
   ``I knew I was going to die,'' Mrs. Petrosyan said. ``But I
wanted my daughter to live.''
   Many stories of courage have emerged from the earthquake in
Armenia, but few, if any, are as touching or harrowing as the tale
Susanna Petrosyan told this week in a soft voice from her Yerevan
hospital bed.
   Around 11:30 a.m. on the day of the quake, she said the two were
driven by Mrs. Petrosyan's husband, Gerkham, a shoemaker, to the
apartment building on Leninakan's Kamo Street where Karine lived.
   Mrs. Petrosyan, a petite woman with thick black hair and curving
eyebrows, wanted to try on a black dress with puffed shoulders that
Karine had for sale.
   It fit her perfectly. As she took it off at 11:41 a.m., the
fifth-floor apartment began to tremble, then shake violently.
   Dressed only in a slip and her underwear, she grabbed Gayaney,
wearing a heavy winter sweater, and ran to the door. Then the floor
opened up and the 36-unit building collapsed.
   The three fell into the basement, with the nine-story building
crumbling around them.
   Although trapped on her back, Mrs. Petrosyan found a 1{-pound jar
of blackberry jam that had fallen to the basement from Karine's
pantry. On the second day of their captivity _ the day Karine died
of her injuries _ she gave the entire jar to Gayaney to eat.
   Mrs. Petrosyan said she found a skirt, perhaps the one she had
tried on, and made a bed for Gayaney to lie on. Despite the bitter
cold, she took off her stockings, and wrapped them around her
daughter to keep her warm.

   As the days passed, and Gayaney's pleas for something to drink
become more pressing, her mother remembered something she had seen
on television.
   ``It was a program about an explorer in the Arctic who was dying
of thirst. His comrade slashed open his hand and gave his friend his
blood,'' she said.
   Losing track of time because of the unchanging darkness, Mrs.
Petrosyan doesn't know what day she cut open her fingers, or how
many times she used the method to feed her daughter.
   Her thoughts wandered. She saw scenes of her life pass before her
eyes, and she hallucinated.
   ``When I closed my eyes and opened them again, I could see boxes
full of apples and bottles of lemonade,'' Mrs. Petrosyan recalled.
``I told my daughter, `My child, there are so many things to eat and
drink.' But when I reached out to touch them, they were gone.''
   Gayaney cried that she wanted to go home. ``I want to be back in
my bed again, and see my daddy,'' she said.
   ``I lost all hope,'' the mother said. ``I was just waiting for
death.''
   On Dec. 14, the eighth day of their captivity, rescue workers
opened a small hole that let in a shaft of light. ``We're saved!''
Mrs. Petrosyan cried.
   ``There's a child in here, be careful not to hurt her!'' she
screamed as they got closer.
   Her husband, a shoemaker, was uninjured by the quake. He was with
the rescuers and the two tearfully embraced. Mrs. Petrosyan was
placed on a stretcher.
   Mother and daughter were flown to Yerevan, Armenia's capital, 60
miles away. Gayaney was taken to Children's Hospital No. 3, Mrs.
Petrosyan to the Armenian national hospital.
   Gayaney was in intensive care for four days, hooked up to
intravenous bottles that dripped liquids into her parched body.
   Her temperature was dangerously low, her blood alarmingly thick
and she was in shock, said Dr. Silva Nersesyan, her physician. The
girl also was in a deep state of depression, and wouldn't talk or
smile.
   Mrs. Petroysan, also dehydrated, was given intravenous fluids and
placed in a coffin-like box so that pressurized oxygen could be
pumped around her as a treatment against exposure.
   It was then that doctors discovered that the woman, who also has
a 7-year-old son who was not hurt in the earthquake, is two months'
pregnant.
   Doctors say both mother and daughter could be released from their
hospitals in as little as a week, but differ about whether Mrs.
Petrosyan's blood helped keep Gayaney alive.
   ``For a child, the concentration of liquids in the body is much
more important than for an adult,'' Nersesyan said. ``For Gayaney,
her mother's blood played an important, perhaps decisive role.''
   Dr. Ripsime Parsadanyan, who treated Mrs. Petrosyan, disagrees.
``Susanna lost a very little, even insignificant amount of blood.
What saved them was that they were together. The mother didn't have
time to panic. She had to think of her child.''
   Gayaney is still weak and has a light case of pneumonia. But the
girl with the big, dark eyes has started to talk again and to smile.
   In her hospital bed, she strings colored yarn through cardboard
dolls and plays with a teddy bear _ Christmas gifts that Jeb Bush,
the son of President-elect George Bush, gave her when he visited the
hospital Sunday.
   Gayaney is too young to understand what happened to her the day
she was buried alive.
   ``Bad people pulled down the house where we were, and we couldn't
get out,'' she said. ``I wanted my father to come and defend us from
those bad people. But he didn't come. Not for a long time.''

   As China enjoys a marked thaw in restrictions on
cultural debate, an intense, voluble man with no political stature
and little fame has launched a one-man crusade to open up debate on
democracy and communist rule.
   Sexual themes now can be portrayed on canvas and the screen, and
economists can question the wisdom of state ownership of factories.
But suggestions for limits to the Communist Party's power are an
invitation for arrest.
   Ren Wanding, a thin, shaggy-haired accountant who rarely laughs,
knows it.
   He spent 1979-83 in prison for having advocated multiparty
democracy, and after a long silence renewed his call last month with
an open letter to the U.N. Human Rights Commission and a 22-page
essay on freedom.
   This week, he began distributing among foreign journalists four
new essays denouncing the ruling Communist Party as a narrow-minded
bully and appealing to the world at large to show concern for human
rights in China.
   ``If one just thinks about things and doesn't have the freedom to
speak out, then there's no freedom,'' Ren wrote in one essay,
explaining his motivation.
   Aware that his own arrest now would prove the point, Ren wrote in
another, ``I appeal to the power of international society for
protection.''
   Ren, an accountant, said in an interview that he spends most of
his non-working hours writing essays and plans to distribute batches
of them each month to foreign and Hong Kong media.
   He said he does not expect to persuade the government to change,
but wants to stimulate public debate and make China's political
prisoners better known abroad, as are the dissidents in the Soviet
Union.
   Ren also is indignant that, as China celebrates the 10th
anniversary of its opening to the outside world and economic reform
under senior leader Deng Xiaoping, activists who advocated many of
the same reforms remain in jail.
   Those jailed, like himself, were leaders of the 1978-79 Democracy
Wall Movement. During those few heady months, intellectuals debated
politics in home-mimeographed journals and posters pasted on a wall
in central Beijing, dubbed Democracy Wall.
   Ren insisted they had an impact, despite their eventual silencing.
   ``If one says that Chinese society has progressed over 10 years
and the economy has grown greatly, all of this is because Chinese
social reformers paid the painful price of sacrificing their freedom
and fortune,'' he wrote. ``Without their brave spirit, could Chinese
have as much freedom of discussion and modernization as they have
today? Would the ruling authorities have voluntarily granted this?''
   Such Democracy Wall themes as the need for multicandidate
elections, greater contact with the outside world and policies to
end China's backwardness have since been adopted by the government.
``Where then is the crime?'' Ren wrote.
   Despite thick glasses and a solemn manner, Ren looks younger than
his 44 years. His work at as an accountant at a Beijing equipment
installation company is not demanding, he said, but he has been
given no chances for promotion.
   Officials have refused to transfer his wife's residence permit
from Tianjin to Beijing, 75 miles away. She lives illegally in
Beijing with him, making it impossible for her to find work.
   Ren said he has not told his 12-year-old daughter that he was in
prison.
   His essays are closely argued outpourings of personal frustration
and outraged principles. In one, he denounced communist authorities
as ``narrow-minded .... They fear the general public but bully small
groups of people.''
   He also denounced the practice of bypassing the courts for
misdemeanor cases and allowing police to hand out sentences for
``labor education.''
   ``There is no way to appeal in court, and covzr-ups, false
arrests and illegalities are hidden,'' he wrote. ``Why doesn't China
even respect its own regulations?''
   Ren, who never was tried, was ordered to undergo labor education
but actually spent his four years in jail ``without labor and
without education,'' he said.
   Newly emerged from his long silence and without a wall or journal
to proclaim his views, Ren seems uncertain how to proceed. He said
he has no plans to go to campuses and address China's most volatile
and receptive sector _ the students _ or to start up a publication.
   So far, neither his employers nor police have questioned him
about his new political activity.
   ``I'm not alone. Many people agree with me,'' he said. But he is
at a loss to explain why he is the only one stepping into the
dangerous limelight. ``I've always been a free-thinker,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Has Powerful Weapon To Negotiate Trade
Accords</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little-known deal between the White House and
Congress should make it easier for President-elect Bush to reach
agreements with the rest of the world on tough trade issues such as
the current dispute over hormones in U.S. beef.
   Beginning Sunday, the 12 countries of the European Economic
Community are banning all imports of meat treated with hormones _
including U.S. beef and veal worth about $100 million a year. The
Reagan administration promised to retaliate by raising duties on
European food shipped here.
   Counterretaliations and counter-counterretaliations are
threatened, in what some see as a potential trade war.
   Over the long run such conflicts can be limited by the United
States using the ``fast track'' for making trade agreements. A
series of agreements is being drafted by 96 governments in the
current ``Uruguay round'' of trade talks.
   Despite its name, the fast track is less important for its speed
than for the power its gives the president. Reagan signed the latest
version into law last August as part of a major trade bill. On
Wednesday he issued an executive order on regulations to implement
the new law.
   It associates key members of Congress closely with trade talks,
though not as actual negotiators. After an agreement is reached,
Congress is pledged to vote it up or down in 90 days _ no exceptions
or conditions, no internal bargaining over details.
   That differs from the usual relations between the White House and
Capitol Hill. Often the administration and Congress bargain for
months or even years over what goes into an important bill before it
becomes law _ or fails.
   The fast track allows the administration to make promises that
are bound to be unpopular in Congress, such as ending protection for
a small industry against foreign competition. Under the fast track
system the negotiators can gamble that Congress will accept the
entire agreement, even if many members dislike parts of it.
   Governments of other countries long have complained that they
cannot get firm commitments from a U.S. negotiator. They can make
firm promises themselves because the French or Japanese prime
ministers, for example, can threaten to dissolve parliament and
force members to fight a new election unless his promises are
supported. A U.S. president can't do that.
   Raymond Vernon, who negotiated for presidents from Franklin
Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter, tells a story about Lord Keynes, the
famous economist who came to Washington to get more aid for Britain
in World War II. Keynes was annoyed to hear one official after
another explain how Roosevelt favored many measures but Congress
would not approve them.
   Keynes dropped his usual politeness when one American, more
pompous than the others, began by saying:
   ``My government _ ''
   ``You know,'' Kenyes interrupted, ``you people don't really have
a government at all, in the usual sense of the word.''
   Many officials, Americans and non-Americans, fail to grasp the
difference between the American system and the parliamentary system.
Non-Americans often complain that the United States has gone back on
a pledge when a U.S. negotiator promises his best effort to get
something done and then Congress _ not operating on the fast track _
refuses to do it.
   Some blamed President Woodrow Wilson for World War II because he
negotiated for a League of Nations after World War I and Congress
refused to join it. Wilson failed to bring key senators close to the
negotiations.
   Vernon identified the inventor of the fast track as Richard L.
Rivers, a Washington lawyer who worked for the Senate Finance
Committee in 1973. President Nixon was trying to negotiate what was
first called the ``Nixon round'' of trade agreements. The White
House asked Congress for a law that would give him almost unlimited
power to negotiate, but allow either house to disapprove the result.
   Rivers said in an interview that he will always remember former
Sen. Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., a key member of the Finance Committee,
fiery reaction to that proposal: ``That's not the way we make our
laws in this country.''
   The Supreme Court since has ruled that such ``legislative
vetoes'' are unconstitutional.
   Rivers wrote a memorandum that devised the fast track for
Talmadge and it became law as part of the president's authority to
negotiate. It was used under Nixon and President Ford to complete
what became known as the ``Tokyo round'' after Nixon resigned.
   Later versions of the fast track have been used under Reagan to
negotiate free trade agreements with Israel and Canada.
   In a recent book, ``Beyond Globalism,'' Vernon has proposed
widening it.
   ``There is a strong temptation to look for a mechanism in which
the main lines of trade policy, monetary policy, fiscal policy and
establishment policy will have been jointly explored between the
branches in an effort to identify the key assumptions, establish the
principal goals and iron out the gross inconsistencies,'' he wrote.
   But he added that it is difficult to envision an effective
dialogue between the president and Congress on so wide a range of
issues.
   Vernon, 75 years old, has retired as a professor of international
relations at Harvard University. His book was written with Debora L.
Spar, who was studying for a doctorate there.

<HEAD>Ag Officials Worry That Low Soil Moisture Will Hurt 1989 Harvest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It will be months before the Agriculture
Department begins to estimate the size of 1989 farm crops, but
analysts are watching carefully how weather and conditions shape up.
   Effects of the savage 1988 drought and moisture-sapping heat are
still being felt in Corn Belt areas badly deficient in subsoil
moisture. Corn and soybeans won't be planted until spring, so
there's some leeway.
   But for winter wheat farmers who planted their 1989 crop this
fall, the crunch is on right now. And in parts of the Great Plains
the news is far from encouraging.
   ``Winter wheat fields in Kansas continued to show signs of
moisture stress,'' the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said Wednesday. ``Greenbug infestation was a continuing
problem.''
   Texas farmers have been spraying to control the greenbugs, and
much of the winter wheat crop in the state also is hurting from lack
of moisture.
   In Colorado, the wheat crop was in ``mostly good'' condition
during the week of Dec. 19-25, but more snow cover was needed, the
report said. Montana's winter wheat was reported in ``mostly fair to
good'' shape, and the Oregon crop was said to be in ``mostly good''
condition, although Russian wheat aphids continued to be a problem
in the eastern part of the state.
   The farm weather facility is operated by the Agriculture and
Commerce departments.
   On Jan. 13 the USDA will issue a report showing how many acres of
winter wheat farmers planted for the 1989 harvest, and there will be
``projections'' of potential harvest output based on past trends,
weather indications and other factors. However, the department's
first official 1989 winter wheat production estimate will not be
ready until May.
   Meanwhile, reports such as the one issued by Commerce and USDA
are sifted carefully by trading interests and others for signs of
what the future may bring.
   Some other observations in Wednesday's report included:
   _The Texas cotton harvest was 97 percent complete by Christmas,
14 percentage points ahead of the five-year average for this time of
the season.
   _Peanut harvesting in Texas was virtually complete.
   _North Carolina's soybean harvest was about 96 percent complete.
   _Tobacco bed preparation continued in the South. In Kentucky,
recent rains brought burley tobacco into ``case,'' and stripping
resumed.
   _Florida's citrus groves were in ``mostly good'' condition,
although lack of rain forced producers to irrigate in most areas.
The vegetable harvests were under way, mainly tomatoes, peppers,
celery and cucumbers.
   _In Arizona, harvesting included lettuce, cauliflower, cabbage
and carrots. In California, rain and cool weather slowed vegetable
planting and harvesting.
   _Pastures in the South were in ``mostly good to fair'' condition,
and livestock was reported mostly in good shape. Snow and cold
temperatures increased livestock stress in Wyoming and Nevada.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has continued its corn-buying splurge and has added some
soybean meal, making up for some orders it had canceled recently.
   Officials said Wednesday the new sales included 600,000 metric
tons of corn and 600,000 tons of soybean meal. The cancellations
earlier in the month had totaled more than 300,000 tons.
   In a separate announcement, USDA said China has bought an
additional 200,000 tons of wheat at subsidized prices, part of 1
million tons authorized for China on Dec. 7. Only 10,000 tons remain
in that authorization.
   The latest sales of corn to the Kremlin brought the Soviet
Union's total to 9.63 million tons in the agreement's sixth year,
which began Oct. 1. Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union
totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 600,000 tons of
corn would be about 23.6 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.63 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning the latest sale
could have a farm value of around $62 million.
   The soybean meal, based on recent Decatur, Ill., prices, could
have a processor value of around $144 million.
   Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under
the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and
1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.

   The Agriculture Department has proposed to
reduce import restrictions on shipments of British swine, pork and
pork products.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday the proposal is a
result of Britain's eradication of hog cholera, a contagious and
sometimes fatal disease of swine. He said no cases of the disease
have been reported since August 1987.
   The restriction currently requires that pork and pork products be
cooked, heated or cured and dried before being shipped from Britain
to ensure that disease organisms were destroyed.
   Under the proposed rule change, small quantities of untreated
pork and pork products for personal consumption will be allowed to
enter the United States from Britain. However, commercial shipments
must orginate only from plants which meet U.S. requirements.
   Glosser said the proposal would affect some U.S. swine producers
who have expressed a desire to import swine breeding stock or semen
from Britain. However, he said, these expected shipments ``would not
have an impact on U.S. swine production.''

   The presidential panel charged with the task of
recommending which military bases to close was conceived in a 1983
report by a group of private businessmen on how the government could
save money.
   That 1983 group, headed by industrialist W.R. Grace, proposed a
non-partisan commission to review the nation's base structure and
suggest which should be shut down.
   The idea was to take Congress out of the picture as much as
possible because of the reluctance on Capitol Hill to permit bases
to be closed. Shuttered installations mean lost jobs among voters,
and Congress has blocked any base closings since 1977.
   The Grace panel's proposal was received unenthusiastically in
Congress, but in 1987, Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, tried to win
approval for the commission. His amendment to a Pentagon budget bill
failed by seven votes.
   Armey was undaunted and spent much of the following winter
rounding up support. With Congress under pressure to cut federal
spending because of rising budget deficits, there were predictions
that closing unneeded bases could save as much as $5 billion a year.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci signed on to the Armey plan
and appointed a commission last summer to begin work.
   But Congress delayed final approval until early October, shortly
before adjourning for the year. The measure passed by Congress and
signed into law by President Reagan created a 12-member commission
and a complicated procedure designed by Armey and other supporters
of closing bases as a way to circumvent congressional pressure.
   Once Carlucci has received the panel's recommendations, he will
have until Jan. 15 _ five days before he leaves office _ to either
accept or reject the entire list. Carlucci cannot pick from among
the list, which is expected to recommend closing two dozen or more
of the nation's largest facilities.
   If Carlucci approves the list, Congress will have 45 legislative
days, starting March 1, to try to block it. For that to happen, both
the House and Senate would have to pass a disapproval resolution,
but that could be vetoed by George Bush. That means the resolution
would need the two-thirds support in each chamber required to
override a veto.
   The base-closing commission has grouped all installations by
military mission, such as Air Force fighter bases and Navy ports for
surface ships. Then, five factors will be used to define a
facility's military value, including:
   _How well a base can fulfill its purpose for deployment of troops.
   _Availability of physical facilities, including runways, storage
areas and warehouses.
   _The physical condition and technical sophistication of those
facilities.
   _Quality of life for personnel and their families at the base.
   _Community support, including transportation, utilities, related
industrial activities and technical help.
   Bases within a certain group, such as Air Force fighter bases,
were ranked using those five criteria. Lower-ranking bases were
considered for closure if higher-ranking facilities could take over
their duties.
   Other factors also were considered, including cost evaluations of
the money to be saved by closing a particular base, environmental
factors such as disposal of hazardous waste, and the impact on the
community of lost jobs.

   President-elect Bush's bass fishing
excursion today takes him to a crossroads community that once played
host to another vice president _ Aaron Burr.
   Bush's itinerary calls for about four hours of fishing with
prominent Alabama sportsman Ray Scott, whose 55-acre private lake is
set in rolling countryside about 15 miles south of Montgomery.
   ``We just want to get in some fishing,'' said Scott, who became a
friend, political ally and infrequent fishing partner of Bush in
1978. ``His fishing is so token, he doesn't have a chance to get at
it much.''
   Scott, who founded the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society two decades
ago and sold the publishing enterprise for $15 million in 1986, is
an outspoken conservationist who predicts Bush will rival Teddy
Roosevelt in supporting America's outdoors.
   ``He feels we've spent enough money on research ... and it's time
for action,'' said Scott in an interview. ``He'll be reasonable but
firm'' in protecting the environment.
   Scott, who got a Thanksgiving Day call from Bush to arrange the
bass fishing outing, has brought attention to a farm community that
is composed mainly of a small elementary school, a library, a fire
station and Mosley's store and service station at the junction of
U.S. 31 and Federal Road.
   Scott, who also has a whitetail deer research program on his
land, enjoys talking about the legends of Pintlala, including visits
made by White House figures prior to Bush.
   He said the old Federal Road that crossed through Pintlala _ a
paved portion of which now runs in front of Scott's gate _ was the
route taken by Gen. Andrew Jackson on his way to New Orleans for the
battle of 1812. Scott and historians also say Burr, the vice
president who killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, paid an unplanned
visit to Pintlala in 1807.
   Burr was was captured in southwest Alabama on treason charges in
Februrary 1807 and was brought up the Federal Road. Scott said Burr
spent one night at Manac's Tavern, which was located at a site about
a quarter-mile from Scott's property at Pintlala.
   ``Pintlala is a Creek Indian word that means `fish swamp.' It
once was a heavy Creek settlement,'' said Scott. ``Manac's Tavern
was owned by Sam Manac, a Creek with large landholdings.... Manac's
son, David, was the first Indian ever to graduate from West Point.''
   The news media descended on Mosley's store and service station in
anticipation of Bush's visit.
   ``It's been a three-ring circus around here,'' said Mary Meadows
as she prepared hot dogs for the lunch crowd Wednesday. Scott said
Secret Service agents had checked out ``every squirrel nest and deer
stand'' on his property.
   The only overt indication that the president-elect was on his way
was a sign outside the Pintlala Baptist Church. It read: ``Welcome
President Bush. Godspeed and Good Fishing.''
   Scott, who remains as a figurehead of the B.A.S.S. operation,
plays host at its fishing tournaments, some of which are carried on
cable television.
   Scott said he met Bush in Montgomery about 10 years ago and was
asked to manage Bush's 1980 campaign in Alabama. ``I'm not sure his
pickin' was too good, otherwise he wouldn't have picked me,'' said
Scott, recalling their loss to Ronald Reagan in the state's primary.
   ``But I'm a good salesman. That's about all politics is anyway,''
he said. ``We just always clicked.''

<TEXT>
   A trout farmer who lost his fish-breeding
license for importing grass-eating carp has vowed to continue his
fight to bring the white amur into the state because of its unique
way of weeding ponds.
   State wildlife officials said they dropped criminal charges
against Warren Candee because they failed to advise the breeder of
his constitutional rights.
   But the 75-year-old Candee is unrepentant.
   ``God made these fish and if he made them to eat weeds, why
should we use chemicals to pollute our water systems?'' he said.
   The chairman of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife said
the agency has banned the fish and all other non-native wildlife
because their long-term effects on the environment are unknown.
   ``Mr. Candee certainly isn't a marine biologist, nor is his
lawyer,'' George L. Darey said Tuesday. ``Until we're 100 percent
sure that they won't have any negative effects on the environment,
we will not turn these fish loose.''
   Candee said he imported the fish from Arkansas and kept them in a
cement pond behind his house. The fish are native to the Amur River,
which flows along the boarder of the Soviet Union and China.
   Darey said he is awaiting the findings of a four-year study
conducted by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation to determine whether Massachusetts should continue its
ban against the fish.

   President Reagan's decision to extend U.S.
territorial waters an additional nine miles offshore will make it
more difficult for foreign countries to spy on American shores,
administration officials say.
   Reagan took the action Wednesday at the Bel Air home where he
will live after Jan. 20. He and first lady Nancy Reagan are spending
the holidays there, but were leaving today for three days in Palm
Springs.
   By a proclamation, the president extended U.S. ``sovereignty and
jurisdiction'' from the present three miles to 12 miles.
   Maureen Walker, a foreign affairs officer in the State
Department's Office of Ocean Law and Policy, said the extension
makes the United States the 105th country to claim a 12-mile limit.
   The 12-mile limit was called for in 1982 by the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the U.S. action leaves only
six countries claiming narrower bands of offshore water. Finland and
Norway claim four miles each, and the Dominican Republic, Greece,
Israel and Turkey each claim six miles, Ms. Walker said.
   ``It will make foreign intelligence-gathering more difficult and
less effective because foreign ships will no longer be able to
station themselves off our shores within the 12-mile limit,'' the
State Department officer said.
   The proclamation assures foreign ships the right of ``innocent
passage'' through U.S. territorial waters and the right to pass
through straits.
   Ms. Walker said it would not affect U.S. and state laws that
govern offshore mineral and fishing rights.
   It applies to the waters off the United States, Puerto Rico,
Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana
islands and any other territory over which the United States
exercises sovereignty. It applies to airspace over the ocean, as
well as the waters and the bed and subsoil of the ocean.
   In another action, the president extended for six months the
state of emergency that he proclaimed in 1986 between the United
States and Libya. The step was needed to continue in effect the
president's 1986 order blocking Libyan assets in the United States
in retaliation for alleged terrorist action.
   The president also signed a seven-page executive order
implementing the 1,100-page trade act passed by the last Congress.
White House deputy press secretary Leslye Arsht said the order will
enable the United States ``to continue effectively to work for more
open world markets and strengthened international institutions.''
   Ms. Arsht said the president's national security adviser, Lt.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, telephoned him at the Bel Air home to inform
him of the announcement by the British Department of Transport that
last week's crash of Pan American Flight 103 in Scotland was caused
by a bomb.
   ``The investigation will continue to determine how the explosives
were introduced into the plane,'' she said. ``The FBI and the FAA
are working closely with the British and Scottish authorities on the
investigation. We are determined to find out who did it, using all
available resources.''

   Judging by previous crashes in which bombing
was suspected, authorities investigating the Pan American Flight 103
disaster may need a lucky break in the case to apprehend those who
carried out the sabotage.
   British authorities said Wednesday that from examining wreckage
they had gathered ``conclusive evidence'' that a bomb blew up the
Pan Am Boeing 747 jumbo jet over southern Scotland last week.
Spokesman John Boyd said Scotland Yard and the FBI had joined forces
in ``a criminal inquiry of international dimensions.''
   The challenge of finding those responsible is illustrated by
looking at two crashes widely blamed on bombing: the Nov. 29, 1987,
crash of a Korean Air Boeing 707 off the coast of Burma and the
plunge of an Air-India 747 into the Irish Sea on June 22, 1985. The
Korean Air crash killed 115 people, while the Air-India tragedy
claimed 329 lives.
   In the incident involving Korean Air Flight 858, suspicion
quickly focused on two passengers, a man and a woman, who were
detained for questioning about forged Japanese passports in Bahrain
as they were about to board a plane for Rome. They had left the
doomed Korean aircraft, bound from Baghdad to Bangkok, at an
intermediary stop in Abu Dhabi.
   The pair, who turned out to be North Korean agents, both bit into
cyanide capsules hidden in cigarette filters. The man, identified as
Kim Sung Il, 70, succeeded in his suicide attempt, but the woman,
Kim Hyon Hui, 25, survived and was extradited to South Korea.
   After questioning by South Korean authorities, Ms. Kim told a
nationally televised news conference on Jan. 15, 1988, that she had
been involved in bombing the Korean Air jet. She said the episode
was intended to disrupt preparations for the 1988 Seoul Olympics and
create unrest in the South.
   ``I came out here hoping such violent, meaningless incidents
would never happen again in the future and I would like to apologize
to family members of the dead and the people here by disclosing the
truth,'' she said in admitting her role in the incident.
   South Korean intelligence officers said Ms. Kim was acting on the
personal orders of Kim Jong Il, son and political heir of top North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
   North Korea officially denied involvement with the crash.
   By contrast, in the crash of Air-India Flight 182, lengthy
investigations by Indian, Canadian, British and Irish authorities
have failed to conclusively pinpoint blame for the tragedy.
   Soon after the crash, unidentified callers to news media said the
crash was the work of extremists associated with Sikh separatist
organizations. Spokesmen for Sikh groups, however, denied any role
and accused India of trying to foment anti-Sikh sentiment.
   According to Indian officials, tapes from the plane's cockpit
voice and flight data recorders, recovered from 6,700 feet below the
surface of the Irish Sea, neither proved nor disproved the
possibility that sabotage was involved. One official, S.N. Sharma,
told reporters the cockpit conversation was normal until it came to
a ``sudden and abrupt end.''
   A report by Canada's Aviation Safety Board, disclosed in January
1986, said there was ``considerable circumstantial and other
evidence that an explosive device'' detonated in the front cargo
compartment of the plane, which was headed from Toronto to Bombay
via London.
   The report linked the explosion to a suitcase checked onto the
flight by a man using the name Singh who did not board the plane.
Singh, meaning lion, is a name used by all male Sikhs.
   A book published in Canada in May 1987 pointed to the lack of
arrests in the Air-India case.
   ``Among the bereaved families, the call for justice is louder,
the bitterness and cynicism sharper than at any time since the
crash,'' said the book, ``The Sorrow and the Terror.''
   The book by award-winning Canadian writers Clark Blaise and his
India-born wife, Bharati Mukherjee, claimed that four members of a
Sikh terrorist cell in Vancouver, British Columbia, were suspected
by police.
   It also claimed that the principals in the case celebrated with
pizza at a Sikh temple in the Toronto suburb of Malton at about the
time the Air-India jet plunged into the sea.
   The problem is to have a case solid enough to prove in court, the
authors said. ``To lose the case on any kind of technicality would
be a political nightmare,'' according to the book.

<HEAD>Administration Identifies Public Buildings That Could Shelter
Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although they may not be available this winter,
44 ``underutilized'' government buildings and 50 land sites have
been designated by the Reagan administration as suitable for
sheltering the nation's homeless.
   Meeting a court-appointed deadline, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development on Thursday ruled that 94 of the 220 pieces of
property it reviewed in the past two weeks are suitable for
assisting homeless people.
   However, only 33 of the buildings were determined to be suitable
for overnight occupancy or for daytime activities. Another 11 were
called suitable only for non-occupancy programs such as warehousing
food and clothing.
   James E. Schoenberger, deputy assistant HUD secretary for
housing, said the unused or underutilized land parcels could be used
as sites for erecting mobile homes or modular units as temporary
shelters.
   It is problematic whether any of the facilities might be made
available for the homeless before this winter is over.
   ``This is a multi-stage process and HUD is sort of in the middle
of it,'' Schoenberger said. ``But this could be a relatively quick
process from this point on.''
   Some of the properties could be made available in less than 45
days, HUD officials said, assuming they meet local health and
building codes.
   City and state officials or private, non-profit organizations
wanting to use the buildings or land have 30 days to submit
applications. The General Services Administration and the Department
of Health and Human Services, which own the properties, then have a
maximum of 15 days to review the applications.
   HUD was under a Dec. 28 deadline imposed two weeks ago by U.S.
District Court Judge Oliver Gasch here to review at least half of
350 properties listed by GSA and HHS as being excess or surplus. He
gave HUD until Jan. 12 to survey the rest of the listed properties,
which includes some 1,000 buildings.
   The government defines excess property as buildings or land under
the authority of a particular agency that doesn't have any use for
it. Surplus property is that for which no government agency has any
use.
   Because HUD had only two weeks under Gasch's order to come up
with a list, Schoenberger said the determinations of suitability
were made solely on the basis of questionnaires filled out by GSA
and HHS.
   ``We originally intended to have HUD field office staff inspect
all properties which appeared to be suitable,'' he said. ``However,
the short amount of time allowed ... required that we omit the
on-site property inspection.''
   Gasch imposed the deadlines in response to a suit filed last
September by the National Coalition for the Homeless accusing the
administration of failing to implement a law passed in July 1987 to
make ``underutilized'' federal property available for use as
emergency shelters.
   Maris Foscarinis, an attorney for the coalition, called
President-elect Bush's support of the program encouraging but said
it is ``shameful that the Reagan administration forced a protracted
court battle before obeying a congressional mandate.''
   Of the 126 facilities found unsuitable because they lack sound
floors, foundations, roofs, walls, electric power or sanitary or
water facilities, 53 are buildings and 73 are land sites.
   The locations of unused or underutilized federally owned
buildings listed as suitable for overnight shelters were listed as:
   Bell, Point Arena, Tracy and West Los Angeles, Calif.;
Washington, D.C.; Waycross, Ga.; Oxford and Shoshone, Idaho; Dana,
Ind.; Boothville, La.; Middle River, Md.; Pontiac, Mich.; Remer,
Minn.; Vicksburg, Miss.; Tonopah, Nev.; Binghamton, N.Y.;
Smithfield, N.C.; Hauser and Klamath Falls, Ore.; Phoenixville, Pa.;
Aquadilla and San Juan, Puerto Rico; Maryville, Tenn.; Carrizo
Springs, Rockwall and San Antonio, Texas; Arlington, Va.; Elma and
Warden, Wash., and Lander, Wyo.

<HEAD>Bush Taps No. 2 CIA Official For Deputy National Security Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush has picked No. 2 CIA
official Robert M. Gates as his deputy national security adviser and
is nominating career intelligence analyst Richard J. Kerr to replace
Gates at the spy agency.
   Gates ``knows the system, the critical importance of the
interagency process for presidential decision-making and the details
of the management of that process,'' Bush said Wednesday in a
statement issued in Washington while he was hunting in Texas.
   Gates gained national attention in the spring of 1987, when
President Reagan nominated him to succeed the late William J. Casey
as director of central intelligence.
   Furor over the Iran-Contra affair delayed Senate confirmation of
the nomination, and Gates asked that his name be withdrawn in March
1987.
   Gates has denied consistently that he tried to cover up the CIA
role in the Iran arms deal, and he has kept a high reputation among
intelligence experts on Capitol Hill.
   The vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen.
William Cohen, R-Me., said Wednesday that Gates ``brings a
tremendous reservoir of talent'' to the National Security Council
staff.
   Cohen, in a statement issued through a spokeswoman, called Gates
``an outstanding choice. Bob Gates is a loss for the intelligence
agency and a gain for the National Security Council.''
   Gates would serve as deputy to Bush's designated national
security adviser, retired Air Force Gen. Brent Scowcroft. Now, Lt.
Col. Colin L. Powell is national security adviser and John D.
Negroponte is his deputy.
   Gates' appointment is not subject to Senate confirmation; that of
Kerr as deputy to CIA Director William Webster is subject to
hearings by the Senate intelligence panel and a two-thirds vote of
the full Senate.
   Had Gates been confirmed as director of central intelligence, he
would have been the first CIA analyst to have attained that post.
Previous CIA directors either have served in the spy agency's
clandestine service or have come from outside, like Webster or Bush,
who was CIA chief in 1976.
   Kerr has spent his career as a CIA analyst and administrator.
   Webster said the appointment of Gates ``is tribute to him and a
vote of confidence for the agency. While we will miss him here, his
appointment is a real plus for the national security of this
country.''
   Kerr is ``a highly qualified CIA career officer ...,'' said
Webster. ``As deputy director for intelligence, heading up the
analytical side of the agency, Kerr is my principal adviser on the
production of finished intelligence, and is widely respected
throughout the intelligence community.''
   The Kerr selection also won praise on Capitol Hill.
   ``Dick Kerr's appointment sends a message that the new
administration is recognizing professional excellence in selecting
top officials in the intelligence area,'' said Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
   Gates, 45, has served with the CIA for 22 years, including a
five-year loan from 1974-79 to the NSC staff.
   He was raised in Wichita, Kan., where he earned straight A's in
high school and was an Eagle Scout. He received a bachelor's degree
from William and Mary College in 1965, a master's degree from
Indiana University in 1966 and a doctorate in Russian history from
Georgetown University in 1974.
   Gates was deputy director for intelligence for more than four
years, and according to one intelligence source greatly improved the
quality of CIA reports.
   Kerr, 53, joined the CIA as a military analyst in 1960,
concentrating on biographical and reference material relating to the
Soviet Union. According to a biography released by the Bush
transition office, Kerr also has worked as an imagery analyst,
apparently scrutinizing satellite photographs.
   Kerr received a bachelor's degree in history and did some
graduate work at the University of Oregon.

<HEAD>Document Points To Alleged Fraud, Bribery By Air Force Official</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wiretaps on the telephones of a defense
consultant and bugging devices in his office have helped
investigators paint a picture of alleged contract fraud and bribery
involving a top Air Force procurement official, according to a
government affidavit.
   The eavesdropping on conversations between Victor D. Cohen, a
deputy to the assistant Air Force secretary for acquisitions, and
consultant William Galvin showed that Cohen ``has used his official
position'' to help Galvin or his clients in exchange for ``payments
and other gratuities,'' the document says.
   One example outlined in the affidavit involves Cubic Corp. of San
Diego, a client of Galvin and maker of shells that house electronic
gear, called pods. Sometime before April 1, 1987, when Galvin's
phones were tapped, Galvin asked Cohen to award an unidentified pod
contract to Cubic on a sole-source basis so that Cubic would be the
only supplier, the document says.
   In a tapped phone conversation May 15, 1987, Cohen told Galvin he
wouldn't award the contract to Cubic as a sole source. But he said
he planned to have the Air Force issue the request for proposal with
a required delivery schedule that Cubic's competitor could not meet,
the affidavit says.
   ``Cohen assured Galvin that by doing it this way, the procurement
would appear to have been completed when, in actuality, Cubic would
be guaranteed the award of the contract,'' the document said.
   Cohen also said he would have the Navy exercise an option on a
joint Air Force-Navy project being built by Cubic's competitor. This
way, Cohen assured Galvin, the competitor would not protest the
delivery schedule and he would not have to justify a sole source
procurement, the document says.
   However, Colvin Wellborn, president of Cubic, didn't like the
plan. Wellborn told Galvin in a phone conversation May 21, 1987,
there was adequate justification for giving Cubic the contract as a
sole source and ``he saw no reason to do a `crooked' competition,''
the affidavit said.
   The document says that later that day Galvin told Wellborn that
Cohen had changed his mind and the contract would be given to Cubic
as a sole source.
   The $9.8 million contract was awarded to Cubic in December 1987.
   The affidavit, which was used to justify a search last June of
Cohen's home in Potomac, Md., does not tie a specific payment from
Cubic or Galvin to Cohen for that contract or for other contracts
mentioned.
   However, the document alleged that ``Cohen's willingness to
assist Cubic in obtaining government contracts can be traced to what
is believed to be the receipt of a payment from Cubic.'' The section
in the affidavit that follows that statement was deleted, as were
other parts of the document at the request of the U.S. attorney's
office.
   The affidavit also says that Cohen appears to have been paid by
Galvin and two of his other clients _ Unisys Corp. and Loral
Electronic Systems Division.
   A receptionist in Cohen's office said he was ``on leave'' and
could not be reached for comment. His home telephone number is
unpublished.
   Cubic and Loral are closed for the holidays and officials could
not be reached for comment. Charles F.C. Ruff, an attorney for
Unisys, said he had no comment.
   The Cohen affidavit and portions of two others were released on
Tuesday in response to a lawsuit by The Washington Post. A hearing
is scheduled for Friday to determine whether portions of the
affidavits that were deleted should also be unsealed.
   The other two affidavits supported searches of the Berwyn
Heights, Md., house of Richard Seelmeyer, a self-employed
consultant, and the Rockville, Md., home and office of consultant
Bill Sanda.
   These locations along with Cohen's home were among 40 locations
raided by FBI agents last June, when the case was first revealed. No
indictments have been handed down.
   Prosecutors have said they have evidence that consultants,
including some former top Pentagon officials who worked for the
nation's largest defense contractors, bribed Defense Department
officials for information that helped them win billions of dollars
in government contracts.

   When Nezar Hindawi wanted to blow up an Israeli
plane in 1986, he packed his girlfriend's suitcase with three pounds
of an odorless explosive called Semtex and sent her to London's
Heathrow airport to board an El Al Boeing 747.
   The bomb, which was pre-set to detonate, passed through an
airport X-ray machine, and it was discovered only after an El Al
security guard questioned the young woman, Anne-Marie Murphy, who
was unaware she was carrying the explosive device.
   Terrorism experts say Semtex, which is one of the substances
suspected in the bombing last week of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland, is a terrorist's dream. So far, it has defied all
detection attempts by X-ray machines, dogs trained to sniff bombs
and other devices.
   ``It's a favorite with these groups because it's significantly
harder to detect than anything else _ it's more powerful than other
plastics,'' said George Carver, a senior CIA analyst in the 1960s
and 1970s who now is a researcher at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think tank.
   Like its American cousin, C-4, Semtex is malleable like putty and
shows up on an X-ray operator's screen as an indistinct, dense mass.
But unlike C-4 and other known plastic bombs, Semtex is odorless.
   Semtex also has the advantage of being stable, meaning it cannot
go off unless it is meant to. Terrorism experts, including Neil
Livingstone of Georgetown University, say Semtex is so reliable it
has been used by Arab terrorists sending letter bombs to Israeli
officials.
   Technology is being developed to overcome the Semtex threat, and
two experimental devices are in use at the Los Angeles and San
Francisco airports. The devices shoot neutrons which can interact
chemically with plastic explosives in luggage and indicate the
existence of a bomb.
   Czechoslovakia, which has a well-developed, state-run arms and
munitions industry, makes Semtex at a plant called the Eastern
Bohemian Works, Livingstone said. State Department officials say
they have asked Czech authorities in the past to stop making Semtex
or at least to prevent its export.
   Recently, Czechoslovakia indicated it might be willing to stop
selling Semtex, said Livingstone, who has served as a consultant to
government security and intelligence agencies and has written seven
books on international security and terrorism.
   Czechoslovakia is believed to have supplied Semtex to Syria and
Libya, said one State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In testimony at Hindawi's 1986 trial, British authorities said
Syria had supplied the bomb for the El Al plane. The British
government subsequently broke off diplomatic relations with Syria
over the affair, although ties later were restored.
   The State Department official said Libya has supplied Semtex in
several shiploads of weapons to the Irish Republican Army in 1986
and 1987 and may have given it to other terrorist groups.
   Semtex also is believed to have been used by a tiny Syrian- and
Libyan-supported Palestinian group once known as the May 15
organization and which is now known as the Hawari group.
   The group is believed to have been responsible for the April 1986
explosion aboard a TWA Boeing 727 flying from Rome to Athens. Four
Americans were killed in the blast, which Greek investigators said
probably was caused by a Semtex bomb the size of two or three
cigarette packs. The bomb was placed under a seat in row 10.
   The Hawari group specializes in plastic bombs, according to U.S.
counterterrorism experts. One of its operatives, Mohammed Rashid, is
being sought by the United States for questioning in the 1982
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Hawaii which resulted in one death.

<HEAD>Bomb Experts Hope New Machine Will Replace Airport X-Ray Detectors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   While X-ray machines are severely limited in
keeping modern explosives off airliners, researchers say they have
developed a device that can detect bombs inside luggage with uncanny
regularity.
   But no airline has ordered one of the devices, and with the
exception of two prototype machines used in a yearlong test program
in San Francisco and Los Angeles, no airports have put the machine
into operation.
   The disclosure Wednesday that a bomb detonated aboard a Pan Am
jumbo jet last week over Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard, is
likely to spur interest in the new explosives detection device,
industry officials said.
   The machine goes by the name of Termal Neutron Analysis device,
or TNA, and is about twice the size of an airport X-ray machine.
During the yearlong test under a contract from the Federal Aviation
Administration it demonstrated a 95 percent detection rate with few
false alarms, the agency said.
   The FAA recently ordered five more TNAs at a cost of $8.4
million. The agency plans to put them into other U.S. airports
beginning next summer.
   ``We are now in the production phase. The research and
development is over,'' said Hadi Bozorgmanesh, a vice president for
Science Applications International Corp. of San Diego, the developer
of the machine. He said the five machines will be used to routinely
monitor baggage checked on regularly scheduled flights.
   Once the FAA and airlines are convinced of the reliability of the
machines, the agency is likely to require the devices be installed
at certain U.S. airports. But that is expected to be several years
away, according to agency sources.
   Bozorgmanesh said his company also has had inquiries from a
number of foreign governments, including Britain, Japan and Italy.
``But none of them have put in orders,'' he added.
   Bozorgmanesh said he is confident the machine can detect a wide
variety of explosives, even the plastic type of explosive which is
believed to have been smuggled aboard the Pan Am jetliner in a piece
of checked luggage.
   Security officials use the conventional X-ray machines that are
currently at airport screening points to detect metal parts or
wiring that might resemble a bomb. But there are many explosives
that can be shaped in a variety of innocent-looking forms _ and they
are so powerful that a few pounds can rip apart a jetliner.
   However, the TNA machine does not look for certain sizes or
shapes. It relies instead on the fact that all explosives contain
large and concentrated amounts of nitrogen.
   According to TNA's developers, the machine bombards a piece of
luggage with neutrons, which pass through all types of material _
even sheets of lead _ without a significant reaction. But the
nitrogen in explosives absorbs the neutrons and immediately gives
off gamma radiation. The gamma radiation gives the luggage a unique
signature that can be detected by the machine.
   The amount of radiation has no significant effect on the suitcase
or its contents, Bozorgmanesh said.
   The FAA _ with a nudge from Congress _ stepped up its development
of bomb detection devices after a terrorist bomb apparently caused
an Air-India jumbo jet to crash off the Irish coast in l985 and a
bomb detonated aboard a Trans World Airlines jet over the
Mediterranean in 1986, killing four Americans.
   While the technology soon became workable in a laboratory
environment, adapting it for use at a crowded airport where
thousands of pieces of luggage must be scanned in a short period was
more of a challenge.
   Raymond Salazar, director of aviation security at the FAA, said
initially there were too many false alarms, but those problems
appear to have been resolved. ``Our results have been very, very
satisfactory,'' he said.
   According to the FAA, the device is capable of scanning a piece
of luggage in six seconds and can be adapted for use with a conveyor
system that could handle large numbers of baggage in relatively
short periods of time with a low rate of false alarms.
   ``You could do an entire Boeing 747 in a half hour or so,''
Bozorgmanesh said in a telephone interview from the company's San
Diego office.
   Each machine now costs more than $1 million, but eventually the
cost is expected to range from about $500,000 to $900,000, depending
on how many are produced, according to FAA and industry estimates.
   ``We could produce a lot of them in a short period of time,''
Bozorgmanesh said. But he added, ``The airlines are not lined up
right now to purchase these things. We have to demonstrate to them
that it works.''

<HEAD>Final Vote Tally Gives Bush Victory By Just Over 7 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Final, official vote tallies from the Nov. 8 presidential
election show Republican George Bush defeated Democrat Michael
Dukakis by slightly more than 7 million votes of the more than 91.5
million cast in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
   The president-elect garnered 53.37 percent of the vote, while
Dukakis got 45.67 percent. Minor party candidates received less than
1 percent of the votes.
   A total of 91,585,872 votes were cast for candidates who were
listed on the state ballots.
   Bush's biggest vote margin came in Florida, where he bested the
Massachusetts governor by about 960,000 votes. His biggest
percentage margin was in Utah, where Bush received 66.2 percent of
the total vote, to 32.04 percent for Dukakis.
   Dukakis' biggest vote margin was in New York, which he won by
266,000 votes of more than 6.4 million cast. The District of
Columbia gave Dukakis the highest vote percentage _ 83.31 percent _
followed by Rhode Island, where he won 55.65 percent of the vote.
   Libertarian nominee Ron Paul was the leading vote-getter among
the non-major party candidates, garnering more than four-tenths of
one percent of the votes. That is above the one-quarter of a percent
of the 1984 vote won by Libertarian candidate David Bergland.
   New Alliance candidate Leonora Fulani won more than two-tenths of
one percent, good for second place among the independent hopefuls.
   Most of the third-party candidates were on the ballot in only a
handful of states each. Only Fulani was on the ballot in all 50
states. Paul was on the ballot in 47 states.
   Here are the final national vote returns and the percentage for
each candidate. A party identification is listed for most
candidates, although many third-party candidates run under different
banners in different states.

<HEAD>Continental Flight Diverted After Cabin Depressurized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flight carrying 40 passengers was diverted for an
unscheduled landing at Logan International Airport Wednesday after
losing cabin pressurization, apparently due to a faulty valve,
officials said.
   Continental Airlines Flight 269 from Hartford, Conn., to
Cleveland had been airborne for about a half hour when the cabin of
the Boeing 737 aircraft depressurized, said Continental spokesman
Dave Messing in Houston. Passengers were told to use oxygen masks,
and no-one was injured, he said.
   The flight was diverted to Logan, where it landed without
incident at about 5 p.m. and passengers were put on other flights.
   The plane was to be repaired overnight, Messing said.
   ``The mechanics are looking at it. At this point it appears the
depressurization stemmed from a faulty valve in the pressurization
system,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Roseanne' Beats `Cosby'; NBC Might Have All-Win Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC had its first No. 1 series since 1984 when
``Roseanne'' edged NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' for the top spot in the
weekly A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   The last ABC No. 1 show that was a regularly scheduled series was
the Dec. 19, 1984, episode of ``Dynasty.''
   Due to expected low holiday week viewing, NBC loaded up its
schedule with repeats. A first-run ``Roseanne'' beat a repeat of
``Cosby.''
   The rest of the top 10 were: ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Who's the Boss?''
ABC, ``Monday Night Football,'' ABC; ``A Different World,'' NBC;
``L.A. Law,'' NBC; ``Matlock,'' NBC; ``Night Court,'' NBC; and ``In
the Heat of the Night,'' NBC.
   CBS' highest-rated shows of the week were ``Designing Women'' at
17th, followed by ``Murphy Brown'' at 18th.
   NBC racked up its 27th straight weekly victory. If NBC wins the
rest of the season, it would be the first time a network has done so
since CBS won every week of the 1963-64 season. NBC came within a
week of that 39-week record last year, but the World Series on ABC
broke the streak.
   If NBC does set a record for 1988-89 it will be with an asterisk
because the writers' strike delayed ABC's and CBS' fall lineups,
while NBC began the season with the Summer Olympics.
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time
rating of 13.7 to ABC's 11.7 and CBS' 10.9. The season officially
began 14 weeks ago, giving NBC a season-to-date average rating of
16.0 to ABC's 13.1 and CBS' 11.9. ABC and CBS count the season as
having begun in late October, at which time they had gotten most of
their strike-delayed new shows on the air.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television.
   The network news race is so close, the ratings changed ever so
slightly last week and turned the standings around. The ``CBS
Evening News'' resumed first place with an average 11.0 rating.
``ABC World News Tonight'' had 10.8, and ``NBC Nightly News'' had
10.6.
   Due to Christmas Eve and Christmas Day falling on Saturday and
Sunday, the only two nights of Fox programming, Fox ran all repeats
and suffered an expectable drop in ratings. It's lowest-rated show,
``Beyond Tomorrow,'' had a meager 1.9 rating.

<TEXT>
   At a City Council meeting this month,
Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima was asked his opinion of Emperor Hirohito's
wartime responsibility _ an especially sensitive question
considering the monarch's frail condition.
   The mayor's response, that Hirohito shares the blame for World
War II and might have spared this city the atomic bomb, has created
a nationwide backlash that includes calls for Motoshima's ouster and
huge anti-Motoshima rallies.
   It cost Motoshima the support of the governing party and will
likely cost him a fourth term in office, and it illustrated the
risks of speaking negatively of the 87-year-old emperor.
   At the meeting, Motoshima said that judging from historical
accounts and his own wartime experience, ``I believe the emperor
shares responsibility for the war, as well as all of us who lived in
that period.''
   Coming on the 47th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor,
the comments were seen as especially inappropriate by Japanese, who
consider it despicable to criticize a suffering person.
   More than 100 trucks with loudspeakers paraded through the city
center blaring demands that Motoshima be removed from office. About
1,200 riot police were mobilized, both to guard the mayor and to
prevent street violence.
   Apart from leaders of the anti-emperor Communist Party, few
public figures have spoken about Hirohito's wartime role since he
became seriously ill three months ago with intestinal bleeding and
has been hovering near death since.
   Soon after Motoshima's comment, which came in response to a
question from a Communist municipal assembly member, right-wingers
had about 10 sound trucks roaring down Nagasaki's streets.
   Rightists from many parts of Japan converged on this port city of
450,000.
   On Dec. 21 and 22, about 100 sound trucks surrounded City Hall
for three hours each afternoon.
   Haranguing speeches and slogans like ``Death to Motoshima!'' and
``Kick the traitor out of Japan!'' blared from loudspeakers, and
about 260 radical rightists wearing military-style uniforms were
present.
   A delegation from the Liberal Democratic Party, which controls
the national government and had backed the indepependent Motoshima
since he took office in 1979, demanded the mayor retract the
comments.
   When he refused, the party decided to withdraw its support,
making it unlikely Motoshima could win a fourth term.
   ``It was an act of extreme indiscretion for a public figure like
him to express such a view publicly at this time when the emperor is
ill,'' said Shigeki Honda, deputy head of the party in Nagasaki
prefecture.
   Motoshima has received death threats, and last week a rightist
charged into City Hall carrying a can of gasoline. He was arrested
before he could do any damage.
   ``I never felt in such immense danger to my personal safety as
well as to my family's in my life,'' the mayor told The Associated
Press.
   ``How can I take it back when I said what I believe?'' he asked.
``I feel the withdrawal of my statement would endanger the hard-won
freedom of speech in this country.''
   His view of the emperor's partial responsibility for the war is
believed widely held among Japanese, especially intellectuals.
   Hirohito was a figurehead while real power was held by
militarists, but he was able to decide to end the war when the
government was evenly divided in August 1945, after the United
States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   In Nagasaki on that Aug. 9, more than 70,000 people died, about
35 percent of the city's population. In Hiroshima, which took the
first bomb Aug. 6, the death toll was about 140,000.
   ``Especially among the people of Nagasaki, there is a strong
feeling that if the emperor could stop the war on Aug. 15, 1945, why
couldn't he have done it a week earlier, so the tragedy on Aug. 9
could have been avoided,'' Motoshima told the AP.
   He said the Japanese have been wrong to put such a taboo on
discussing the wartime role of the emperor, revered as a Shinto god.
   ``I said what I believe, but to be honest, I did not expect this
would cause such a big fuss,'' he said. ``I guess the real mistake
was I waited to say it until now.''
   He blamed ``the fear of rightist attacks and the complexity of
the matter'' for making most Japanese hesitate to even talk about it.
   Some Nagasaki citizens have expressed support for the mayor.
   ``He said what long needed to be said,'' said Shigetoshi
Iwamatsu, a social studies professor at Nagasaki University. ``Right
now, the more serious problem is the rightists' threat to freedom of
speech.''
   Said Tatsuichiro Akizuki, a noted peace activist and president of
St. Francis Hospital, ``This incident shows how crippled we are in
discussing the emperor properly and objectively.
   ``The question of the emperor's responsibility in the war was
left out of our mind for so long that most of us have forgotten how
to deal with it.''

<HEAD>Regulators Feel Year-End Pressure To Arrange S&L Bailouts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are racing the clock to
complete a string of bailout packages for insolvent savings and loan
institutions before the end of the year when tax breaks for
investors will be cut in half.
   Officials expect that before Sunday as many as 200 failed savings
and loans will have been dealt with this year, setting a
post-Depression record. By contrast, 48 S&Ls were merged or closed
last year.
   So far the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has handled the cases of
184 failed S&Ls, including two bailouts announced Wednesday that are
among the largest.
   The bank board put together a $5.1 billion package to assist in
the takeover of five of the most troubled savings and loans in Texas
by an investment group led by Ronald O. Perelman, the head of
Revlon, the cosmetics company.
   Also on Wednesday, the bank board pledged $1.7 billion in
government assistance in the purchase of American Savings and Loan
Association of Stockton, Calif., the nation's largest insolvent S&L,
by a group headed by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass.
   The size of the government assistance packages being required to
attract new investors points up the depth of the problem facing the
S&L industry and the incoming Bush administration, analysts said.
   The trouble is that virtually all of the options President-elect
Bush can select from to deal with the crisis involve spending more
federal money, which will in turn worsen his other big economic
problem: finding a way to narrow the federal budget deficit without
resorting to new taxes.
   Estimates of the total cost to the government of resolving the
S&L mess range as high as $112 billion, and losses are mounting by
$1 billion a month. For this reason, analysts said, Bush cannot
afford to delay seeking a solution.
   ``The Bush administration will be committing political suicide if
it doesn't candidly address this problem immediately after taking
office,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria,
Va. ``This is a big, expensive problem and it is getting bigger.''
   The bank board worked late into the night Wednesday as the agency
raced the clock to finish as many deals as possible before Jan. 1
when certain tax writeoffs will expire.
   The provisions that will expire had allowed firms purchasing
failed S&Ls to deduct the previous losses of those associations from
profits the firms earned on other operations.
   The loss of that provision will effectively cut the tax benefit
to purchasers in half. In virtually all transactions completed in
1988, the firms taking over the S&Ls will qualify for tax breaks
that will exceed what they are paying for the institutions.
   Critics have charged that even though the size of the lost tax
revenues will be enormous, the bank board is not taking this revenue
drain into account in figuring the total cost to the government of
the bailout packages.
   In a recent letter to Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was concerned about the tax
benefits being handed out and he said Congress would likely look
into that in the new year.
   Even with the post-Depression record number of insolvent S&Ls
being handled this year, more than 400 insolvent institutions remain
open, and hundreds more are close to insolvency.
   So far the government assistance has come primarily from the
insurance fees the healthy S&Ls pay to the federal agency which
insures individual deposits up to $100,000.
   But the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which is an arm
of the bank board, is itself technically insolvent, with its
obligations to merge or close sick S&Ls far outweighing the revenue
stream expected from industry fees.
   It is this gap which critics say the Bush administration and
Congress will have to find a way of closing. Even now, the Reagan
administration is grappling with the problem of finding additional
money for S&Ls in its final budget, which must be submitted to
Congress on Jan. 9.
   All of the S&Ls being taken over this week have been insolvent
for several years but have been kept open because the insurance fund
did not have enough cash to pay off depositors or shut them down.
   Some in Congress have criticized the bank board's rescue packages
for failing to attract enough money from the investors taking over
the failed S&Ls.
   But Wall said Wednesday that the cost to the government of simply
closing the insolvent institutions and paying off depositors to the
maximum of $100,000 would be far more costly.
   In addition to the American Savings rescue plan and the takeover
of five of the most troubled Texas institutions, the bank board on
Wednesday also approved takeovers of:
   _First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Columbus, Ga., by
Barnett Bank Inc. of Jacksonville.
   _McLean Federal Savings and Loan of Virginia by NVRyan L.P., a
home construction company.
   _First Financial Savings Bank of Des Moines, Iowa, by
Metropolitan Federal Bank of Iowa.

<HEAD>Debate Over Growth Hormones in Meat Pits Profits Against Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although U.S. and European officials agree that
the scientific debate over hormone-treated meat is just one aspect
in their cross-Atlantic trade dispute, it nonetheless has focused
concern on whether health safety is being sacrificed for profits.
   European consumers and U.S. health advocacy groups say eating
hormone-treated meat may be hazardous to your health. But many
American scientists and government officials disagree.
   The debate has been spotlighted by a ban that the European
Economic Community plans to implement Jan. 1 against hormone-treated
beef and veal from the United States and all other foreign suppliers.
   The ban, which will cost U.S. meat producers some $100 million in
export sales to the 12-nation EEC, has sparked a warning of U.S.
retaliation against some European food products that could
deteriorate into a full-scale trade war.
   Producers of beef and veal treat their cattle with hormones in
order to make them grow faster, but U.S. regulatory officials say
the quantities are minuscule compared with the amounts of the same
hormones produced naturally by the human body.
   The maximum dose allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for
cattle equals one-tenth of the amount of the hormone found in
pre-pubescent children, who have the lowest hormone level in humans.
``It's totally inconsequential,'' Richard Teske, deputy director of
the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said Wednesday.
   The FDA approves only three kinds of hormone treatment: estrogen,
progesterone and testosterone. It banned diethyl stilbestrol, or
DES, 10 years ago after it was proven to be cancer-causing.
   Use of DES by European cattle growers resulted in a scare for
Italian consumers in 1980, when hundreds of children showed signs of
early sexual development such as breast growth.
   Similar reports of pre-pubescent development among some 3,000
Puerto Rican children in the early 1980s were never traced back to
hormone use in animals, Tiske said.
   Residues of DES also were discovered in residents of West Germany
and Holland, prompting a consumer movement that led to European-wide
legislation against hormone-treated meat.
   But unlike European breeders, who in the past injected hormones
into the skeletal parts of the cattle, American cattle raisers are
only allowed to administer the hormones to the non-edible parts of
the animals.
   Under FDA regulations, the hormone pellets are shot into the
animals' ears, from where they release the substance slowly into the
blood stream. Thus, humans do not ingest meat with a high
concentration of hormones.
   Some abuses of the FDA standards have been reported, such as meat
producers who inject the pellet into the edible portion of the
cattle to make the hormones spread faster, Teske said. But such
cases are rare, and there are no known black-market exports to
European consumers, he added.
   Ironically, there have been many more reported cases of
black-market meat sales in Europe, and the European Parliament is
investigating reports of hormone treatment of animals in defiance of
the EEC ban.
   But some American consumers, despite assurances from the FDA,
have decided to take their case directly to the retailers.
   ``The question is whether consumers should be forced to wait
until the scientific dust settles, or whether it's better to be safe
than sorry,'' said Dan Howell of the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group concerned with nutrition
and health issues.
   The center has been spearheading a grassroots campaign to
encourage consumers to demand hormone-free meat. Several businesses
already produce it.
   Howell said that despite the lack of conclusive scientific
evidence of a direct link between cancer and hormone-treated meat,
the government has been derelict in failing to pursue more research.
   He attributed the reluctance partly to a decline in government
regulation under the Reagan administration and partly to pressure
from the cattle industry.

   Pan Am Flight 103 disappeared from radar screens soon after
taking off from London on its way to New York and crashes into the
village of Lockerbie, Scotland. All 259 people on the Boeing 747 are
killed, and 11 missing townspeople are presumed dead.
   Investigators said they found conclusive evidence that a plastic
explosive was used to blow up the plane. The evidence was found on a
metal luggage container recovered from the wreckage.
   Speculation on who was responsible focused on several terrorist
groups in the Middle East. Among them were the Fatah Revolutionary
Council headed by Abu Nidal, and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command headed by Ahmed Jibril.

   Korean Airlines Flight 858 disappears over the jungle near the
Thailand-Burma border. All 115 people aboard the Boeing 707 are
killed.
   Suspicion about a planted bomb focused on two passengers, a man
and woman, detained after they were questioned about forged Japanese
passports and bit into cyanide capsules hidden in cigarette filters.
The couple had left the KAL flight, which was bound from Baghdad to
Bangkok, in Abu Dhabi, one stop before it disappeared. The man
succeeded in his suicide attempt, but the woman survived.
   South Korean officials believe the couple left bags on the plane
that contained a bomb, and suggested they were North Korean agents
who blew up the plane as part of a long_range scheme to disrupt the
1988 Seoul Olympics. North Korea called the accusation ``silly and
far-fetched.''

   Four Americans are killed when a bomb explodes under a seat on
Trans World Airlines Flight 840 from Rome to Athens. Nine other
passengers are injured.
   The Boeing 727 was beginning its descent when the bomb blew a
gaping hole in the fuselage. Two women, a mother and daughter, and
the daughter's baby were killed when they were sucked from the plane
and plummeted to the ground. The fourth victim, also found on the
ground, was killed instantly when the bomb exploded under his seat.
   Authorities speculated the terrorist who set the charge may have
been confused by Italy's recent shift to daylight-saving time. Had
the bomb gone off an hour earlier _ before the jet began its descent
_ the massive decompression of the fuselage would have caused a
crash killing all 122 people aboard.
   Police said the explosive device was left under the seat by a
woman carrying a Lebanese passport under the name Mei Mansour who
sat in the seat earlier, when the plane was westbound. Mansour later
appeared in Beirut and denied responsibility.

   Air-India Flight 182 blows apart off the coast of Ireland,
killing all 329 people aboard. The Boeing 747 was on its way from
Toronto to Bombay, via London.
   An inquiry by the Indian government concluded that a bomb caused
the crash.
   Canadian authorities said a man checked a suitcase onto the plane
but did not board. In another incident the same day, Canadian
officials say, Sikh militants planted a suitcase bomb on a Canadian
jetliner in Vancouver. The bag exploded while being transferred to
an Air-India flight at the Tokyo airport, killing two baggage
handlers.
   Despite circumstantial evidence, police have been unable to prove
their contention that extremist Sikhs based in British Columbia
planted the bombs to retaliate for the storming of a Sikh shrine in
India by government troops. Anonymous callers claimed responsibility
for the crash on behalf of Sikh groups.

   A 16-year-old Japanese boy is killed by a bomb that explodes
aboard a Pan Am jetliner bound from Tokyo to Hawaii. Fifteen other
passengers, including the boy's parents, are injured.
   The plane, carrying 285 people, landed safely despite the
explosion, which occurred about 140 miles out from Hawaii. No
individual or group claimed responsibility for the explosion.
   In May 1988, a Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, was arrested at
Athens airport, on a tip from the U.S. Embassy in the Greek capital,
and charged with planting the bomb aboard the trans-Pacific
airliner. American officials have said Rashid also was involved in
the 1986 TWA bombing.

   A Cubana Airlines DC-8 crashes into the sea minutes after taking

24 members of the Cuban national fencing team.
   Nine minutes after takeoff, the pilot contacted the control
tower: ``Seawell, Seawell, C0455. We have an explosion on board.
We're descending fast. ... We have fire on board. ... Request
immediate landing permission.'' Another explosion went off and the
pilot was heard shouting, ``Shut the door!'' The plane hit the ocean
several miles offshore.
   Four Cuban exiles living in Venezuela were charged with the
bombing. Two were convicted, one escaped, and a fourth, anti-Castro

fighting the charges, was never convicted, and finally was released
and returned to the United States last February.

   Snow continued in the Northeast on Wednesday and hurricane-force
winds blasted Maryland, blowing the roof off a terminal at a
Baltimore airport, collapsing at least three buildings and knocking
out electricity for at least 300,000 customers in the region.
   Light snow extended from the upper Ohio Valley to northern New
England, and up to 8 inches blanketed Indiana by Wednesday morning.
   Heavier snowfall totals for the six-hour period up to 1 p.m. EST
included 3 inches at Dayton, Ohio, and 2 inches at Buffalo, N.Y.,
Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, and at Evansville, Ind.
   An inch of snow in Little Rock, Ark., established a record for
the date.
   In California, Interstate 5 was closed for hours after a gasoline
tanker truck slipped on icy pavement, crashed into other cars and
exploded with a fireball visible miles away, authorities said. There
were only two minor injuries in that wreck.
   Snow advisories were posted Wednesday night for most of Ohio,
portions of Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
   Strong northerly winds were ushering cold air into the eastern
portion of the country.
   In Baltimore, gusts were clocked at 80 mph. The wind collapsed
three vacant buildings, blew roofs off five houses and ripped the
roofs of two buildings in Baltimore County, authorities said.
   Part of the roof on the main terminal at Baltimore-Washington
International Airport flew onto the tarmac and the wind blew out two
glass windows, said Bob Ware, advertising manager at BWI. There were
no injuries, he said.
   Other buildings also were damaged, but flights returned to normal
after a brief delay, airport officials said.
   About 185,000 customers of Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. lost
electricity in the storm, spokesman Charles Franklin said, and
99,000 remained without power late Wednesday.
   Other utility spokesmen said 30,000 customers lost power in
Delaware and more than 100,000 in Washington, D.C.
   Winds gusted at up to 77 mph in the nation's capital, blowing
trees onto houses and into crowded streets at rush hour.
   Firefighters in nearby Fairfax County, Va., reported rescuing
several people from collapsed structures such as trailers and
buildings under contruction.
   A gale warning was in effect for Lake Ontario, and a high wind
warning was posted for the mountains of North Carolina.
   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed ahead of the cold front in
the eastern United States. Temperatures were in the 70s over much of
the southern Atlantic Coast region, with lower 80s across much of
Florida.
   Daytona Beach surpassed its record high for the date of 81
degrees set in 1987.
   Temperatures were freezing from the northern and central high
Plains to the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes region, and were
generally below zero from eastern Montana to Minnesota.
   Parts of the Southwest had snow, including southern Utah and
Nevada. A winter storm watch was posted in New Mexico.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees below zero at Grand Forks, N.D., to 84 degrees at Fort
Myers, Fla. The nation's low Wednesday morning was 18 degrees below
zero at Dickinson and Williston, N.D.
   The forecast for Thursday called for wet weather to extend from
the northern Pacific Coast to the northern Rocky Mountains, with
snow in the higher elevations. Rain and snow showers were expected
to be scattered across much of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Widely
scattered snow showers were predicted from Illinois to the lower
Great Lakes region. Fair to partly sunny skies should prevail across
the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were forecast to remain below freezing all day
across much of the Plateau and Rocky Mountain region and from the
northern high Plains through the middle and upper Mississippi Valley
to northern New England. Highs in the teens and single digits were
expected from eastern Montana through the Dakotas to upper Michigan
and across northern Maine. The rest of the nation should have highs
in the 50s, 60s and 70s.

<HEAD>GAO Study Says Criteria For Veterans' Disability Benefits Are
Outdated</HEAD>

   Many disabled veterans may be missing out on
hundreds of dollars' worth of benefits from the Veterans
Administration because the payments are calculated with outdated
medical standards, according to a congressional study.
   The VA, responding to the report Wednesday by the General
Accounting Office, said it has agreed to make the first
comprehensive overhaul of the medical standards since 1945.
   The standards have been updated on a piecemeal basis over the
past few decades, the report said, but they still fail to take into
account many medical advances.
   As a result, the GAO said many veterans may be over- or
under-compensated for injuries that occurred both during military
duty and afterward.
   ``VA cannot ensure that veterans are given accurate and uniform
disability ratings because the rating schedule has not been adjusted
to incorporate the results of many recent medical advances,'' the
study said.
   The VA paid about $14.3 billion in disability benefits to about
3.8 million veterans and their survivors in 1987, said the GAO, the
investigative branch of Congress.
   ``It is inherently difficult to achieve uniform and accurate
administration of this type of program; out-of-date rating schedules
make it almost impossible,'' according to the report.
   Some medical conditions are not listed in the schedule, which
means a VA rating specialist must use his or her own judgment to
classify the disability, the report said.
   Veterans Administrator Thomas K. Turnage, responding to the
study, said he would prepare a plan for a ``methodical review'' of
the rating schedule, and added that he agreed with a recommendation
that the schedule be reviewed regularly from now on.
   The Department of Defense said it agreed with the report's
findings.
   A 1983 internal study by the VA used 13 sample cases representing
23 separate disabilities for which veterans already had been awarded
compensation benefits. Those cases were sent to 56 of the 58 VA
regional offices to be classified.
   In one case, a veteran with hypertensive heart disease was
assigned five different ratings, ranging from 10 percent disability
to 100 percent. Twenty-five rating boards gave him a 30 percent
disability, or $202 per month in benefits, and 21 boards gave him 60
percent, or $516 in benefits.
   In another case, a veteran with post traumatic stress disorder
was rated from zero to 70 percent disabled by the various boards,
which would have meant anywhere from no benefits to $410 a month,
the report said.
   In a GAO survey of 383 VA rating specialists, 61 percent said it
was ``somewhat likely'' or ``very likely'' that in rating mental
disorders, they could reach two or more rating percentages with the
same medical evidence.
   Fifty-one percent said the same situation could occur in rating
neurological and convulsive disorders, and for all types of illness,
22 percent said it was likely to reach more than one conclusion with
the same medical evidence.

<HEAD>Suit Accuses Du Pont Of Putting Too Much Lead in Gasoline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government filed a $8.23 million suit
against E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., accusing the chemicals giant
of helping produce gasoline containing too much lead at a New Jersey
refinery from 1983 through 1985.
   The company, a major supplier of lead compounds, said the suit
was ``without merit'' because it was not subject to the regulations
it is accused of violating.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said a complaint, filed
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., charged that a
joint venture of Du Pont and three other companies put 2 billion
grams too much lead _ 2,200 tons _ in gasoline blended at Carteret,
N.J.
   The government seeks the maximum fine of $10,000 a day for each
of the 823 days specified in the complaint.
   EPA in 1986 filed an administrative complaint against Du Pont but
was unable to reach a settlement with the company.
   In Wilmington, Del., company spokesman Tom Barry read a statement
from Jerry McCleskey, planning director of the company's chemicals
and pigments department, charging that EPA's action was ``without
merit.''
   ``The allegations are false. We will contest the novel and
strained interpretation of the regulations. We complied fully with
all regulations applicable to lead suppliers,'' and cannot be held
responsible for alleged violations by others, McCleskey said.
   Later, Barry himself said it was ``simply not a fact'' that the
operation was a ``joint venture'' as EPA said.
   Du Pont said it was only a supplier. But EPA contended that Du
Pont decided how much lead was to be used, injected the compound at
the blending plant, determined that the final product was suitable
for sale as leaded gasoline and advised the other participants in
the venture about EPA regulations.
   The activities in effect made Du Pont a refiner, subject to the
refining regulations and just as responsible for the excess lead as
any of the other parties, EPA said.
   The agency filed administrative complaints against the other
three companies, two of which are now inactive. The third, A.
Tarricone Inc., a New York petroleum marketer, is operating under
protection of the bankruptcy courts and EPA said it had filed a
claim against that company in the bankruptcy case.
   Lead is the cheapest way to increase gasoline octane, but high
concentrations in auto emissions can cause neurological damage to
children and may contribute to high blood pressure in adults. It
also damages pollution control equipment in cars not designed for
leaded gasoline.
   EPA has been ordering lower concentrations of lead in leaded
gasoline for years. The 1982 limit of 1.1 gram per gallon was
reduced to 0.5 gram on July 1, 1985 and 0.1 gram on Jan. 1, 1986.
   The 2 billion grams of excessive lead added by the Carteret plant
would amount to about 2 percent of all lead used in fuels in
1983-1985, according to EPA estimates.

<HEAD>Report Says Top Aides Refused Mayor's Plan To Blame Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry wanted to blame city police
for unfairly raising suspicions about him in connection with the
aborted drug investigation of an acquaintance, but his senior aides
refused to go along with the plan, according to a published report.
   Barry met with his aides Wednesday in an attempt to draft a
formal response to accusations that he consorted with a man police
identified as a drug suspect.
   The Washington Post reported today that Barry had planned to
suggest that his visits to a downtown hotel to meet former city
employee Charles Lewis involved no wrongdoing, and that poor police
work had unfairly raised suspicions about him. However, three of
Barry's aides refused to endorse the plan, the newspaper reported,
citing sources it did not identify.
   In advance of an expected statement by Barry today on the
incident, one official and a city council called on him to explain
publicly his relationship with Lewis.
   City Councilman James Nathanson said Wednesday that Barry is
suffering ``a credibility problem'' with various council members and
other city officials.
   ``My reaction is, it's too bad we're here again,'' said
Nathanson, referring to allegations of drug involvement that have
dogged Barry for several years. ``My only suggestion is that the
mayor make a public statement about what's happening with him, just
lay it on the line.''
   Police investigators have turned over to the U.S. Attorney's
Office the results of an internal probe into why two detectives were
stopped from attempting an undercover drug buy from Lewis last
Thursday, after Barry turned up at Lewis' hotel room.
   Barry has since acknowledged making several calls upon Lewis,
whom he described as an acquaintance, but denied any involvement
with drugs.
   The current probe was expected to determine whether Lewis was
involved in any drug activity, why the mayor was in the hotel, and
why the police officers did not search Lewis' hotel room until after
he had checked out Friday morning.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office would not comment on
the report.

<HEAD>Second Recall Issued for Wooden Enclosures After Child's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, spurred by the death of a
17-month-old boy in Pennsylvania, has issued a second recall for
wooden, accordion-style enclosures used as playpens for small
children.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday that
Nu-Line Industries of Suring, Wis., is offering a $10 cash refund or
$15 coupon for anyone who returns a wooden enclosure, whether it was
manufactured by Nu-Line or another company.
   The agency said children between 10 months and 2 years of age are
at the greatest risk because their heads can become stuck in the
diamond-shaped openings in the middle of the enclosure or the
V-shaped openings at the top.
   People may reach Nu-Line by calling a toll-free number,
1-800-558-7300.

<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration says more than 15
percent of the men who served in the Vietnam war are suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder.
   A four-year study ordered by Congress and released Wednesday
projected that 479,000 of the 3.1 million veterans who served in the
war suffer the disorder and that about 20 percent have sought
treatment from the VA.
   The survey, based on face-to-face interviews conducted with more
than 3,000 veterans, also found that 8.5 percent of women Vietnam
veterans, or 610 out of an estimated 7,000 who served, now have the
disorder.

   The Federal Trade Commission and Budget
Rent-A-Car Corp. have settled a complaint that the firm had failed
to give timely service to rental cars for which recall notices had
been issued.
   Under a consent agreement with the FTC announced on Wednesday,
Budget agreed to inspect and repair affected vehicles within a

   Some relatives of the 259 people killed on Pan Am Flight 103 were
preparing funerals when authorities confirmed a bomb blew up the
jetliner. The news, although expected, elicited bewilderment, anger
and calls for vengeance.
   The first five bodies of Americans killed in the Dec. 21 crash
arrived in the United States on Wednesday, the day British
investigators confirmed that a bomb had been planted on the
Frankfurt to New York flight, which had stopped in London.
Investigators were trying to determine who planted the bomb.
   Len Colasanti, father of 20-year-old Gary Colasanti, got the news
while preparing for his son's funeral.
   ``If it were an act of God it would be easier for us to accept,''
said Colasanti, of Melrose, Mass. ``The fact that it was a terrorist
act makes it much more difficult to accept Gary's loss.''
   ``At this point, we're just trying to cope with the loss of our
son,'' said Sally Pitt of South Hadley, Mass., mother of victim
James Pitt, 24. ``That sort of thing is more than we can deal with.''
   After the crash, U.S. officials acknowledged that its diplomats
had been warned of a threat to bomb a Pan Am airliner on the
Frankfurt-New York route in December.
   ``I feel that every passenger on that plane should have been
given the same warning as diplomats,'' said Susan Cohen, whose
20-year-old daughter, Theodora, was among 35 students returning home
from a Syracuse University overseas program. ``They know how to
differentiate between safe and real threats.
   ``In those cases where it's serious, security should be heavy,''
Mrs. Cohen said. ``Every piece of luggage should be inspected by
hand. Why didn't they? I'll tell you why. Money.
   ``We cannot allow greed to endanger the lives of American
citizens. My baby will never come back. I will fight with every
breath to see this never happens to another mother,'' she said.
   Gheorghina Vuclu, whose 21-year-old son, Peter, was killed while
heading home for the holidays from his studies in Romania, said she
wasn't surprised by the finding that a bomb caused the crash.
   ``I hope the government does something with this mess and finds
out who did this,'' the Alliance, Ohio, woman said. ``I am so sorry
for this. Everybody loved Pete. God help anybody who suffers like I
do.''
   The family of 20-year-old Steve Berrell of Fargo, N.D., said the
confirmation of a bomb was disheartening.
   ``Although we suspected a bomb from the beginning, the reality is
overwhelming the loss of our Steven by such a senseless act
magnifies the problems that exist in our world today,'' a family
statement said. ``We pray that peace and sanity will soon take over
as the dominant words in our civilization.''
   W.W. Coursey of Faulkville, Ga., whose son U.S. Army Sgt. W.
Larry Coursey was on the flight, said the news ``didn't surprise me
one bit.''
   Coursey said whatever country or party is determined to be
responsible for the bombing ``should be wiped out.''
   ``I hate to be hard-nosed about it, but that's the way I feel,''
he said.
   Margaret Evans of Chattanooga, Tenn., whose nephew, William Mack
of New York City, was aboard, said she was angry but doesn't want
revenge.
   ``I don't believe in retaliation,'' she said. ``I think it would
make more trouble.''

   In their efforts to identify the
bombers, investigators sought today to determine the type of plastic
explosive that downed Pan Am Flight 103 and where and how it was
planted.
   On Wednesday, British authorities ordered U.S. airlines to
toughen their security for checked baggage in light of the Dec. 21
attack, which claimed the lives of 259 people aboard the Boeing 747
and at least 11 local villagers.
   ``At this point, we don't have one particular lead or theory that
we think is more promising than others,'' State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said in Washington. ``We are simply
pursuing all the leads that we have.''
   The investigation is known to involve Scottish police, the FBI,
Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch and federal police in West
Germany. The New York-bound flight originated in Frankfurt with a
Boeing 727.
   The Israeli daily newspaper The Nation has quoted West German
intelligence sources as saying they believe a suspect from the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, led
by a rival of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat named Ahmed Jibril, boarded
the plane in Frankfurt.
   The suspect carried ``a briefcase packed with Syrian-supplied
explosives that cannot be detected by routine security methods,''
The Nation said.
   The guerrilla left Flight 103 while it was in transit in London,
leaving the briefcase behind, the paper reported Friday without
elaborating.
   The Syrian-backed Popular Front became the first terrorist
organization to bomb an airliner in flight when it blew up a Tel
Aviv-bound Swiss airliner in 1970, according to Ian Geldard,
director of research at the private Institute for the Study of
Terrorism in London. Forty-seven people were killed.
   He said the group may have felt itself isolated from the Middle
East peace process because Arafat recognized Israel's right to exist
and renounced terrorism, leading Washington to open a dialogue with
the PLO this month.
   Geldard, however, said he considered Abu Nidal ``the top suspect
because he's the most capable of undertaking a mission of this
type.''
   Abu Nidal heads the Fatah Revolutionary Council, a Palestinian
faction opposed to Arafat's recognition of Israel and talks with the
United States. The Libya-allied guerrilla group has been blamed for
dozens of hijackings, bombings and assassinations since it broke
with Arafat in 1976.
   On Tuesday, Abu Nidal's group said from Lebanon that it was
``painfully saddened'' by the crash.
   But Yonah Alexander, head of the Institute for Studies in
International Terrorism at the State University of New York, said
Abu Nidal does not always take responsibility for attacks for which
his group has been blamed, including a 1986 synagogue attack in
Turkey that killed 22 people and the commandeering of a Pan Am jumbo
jet the day before in Pakistan that left 20 people dead.
   Alexander said Abu Nidal's group is believed to have easy access
to Semtex, a Czechoslovak-made plastic explosive that Libya and
Syria possess. It is lightweight, odorless and the only substance
known to have defied all detection attempts by bomb-sniffing dogs,
X-ray machines and other devices.
   In announcing their finding that a bomb downed Flight 103,
British authorities said Wednesday that the residue of explosives
recovered from the debris was ``consistent with the use of a high
performance plastic explosive'' like Semtex.
   Michael Charles, the chief investigator, said examinations of a
metal luggage pallet found ``conclusive evidence of a detonating
high explosive.''
   ``Much investigative work remains to be done to establish the
nature of the explosive device, what it was contained in, its
location in the aircraft and the sequence of events immediately
following its detonation,'' he said.
   The jet broke apart six miles in the air and rained wreckage and
bodies on Lockerbie and the surrounding countryside. One wing has
still not been located. So far, 241 bodies have been found; nine
identified and released to next-of-kin. Police spokesman Angus
Kennedy said there would be no easing of the search effort, which
involved about 600 people daily.
   L. Paul Bremer, who heads the State Department's anti-terrorism
office, said three groups have claimed responsibility for the
attack: the Guardians of Islamic Revolution, the Islamic Jihad, and
a group of Irish Protestant extremists whose name he did not have.
   The investigation will concentrate principally on two airports:
in Frankfurt and London's Heathrow, where the jumbo jet took over
the flight.
   David Wilshire, an aviation expert and Conservative member of
Parliament, said in London that the passengers on Flight 103
included a dozen who transferred from other flights feeding into
Heathrow.
   The luggage of the 12 transit passengers went through the
Heathrow security system, but luggage belonging to the Frankfurt
passengers did not, he said.
   On Wednesday night, Britain's Transport Department said that,
following consultations with the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration, it was ``immediately directing U.S. airlines to take
additional measures in Britain, in particular in relation to hold
baggage.''

   Fire erupted on the ninth floor of a 13-story
building housing news and entertainment organizations Wednesday
night, briefly trapping an undetermined number of people above the
flames, authorities said.
   More than 80 firefighters battled the blaze, which broke out
shortly before 9:30 p.m. and was put out within an hour, said
Firefighter Jim Wells.
   Office and maintenance workers trapped by the flames at the
Cahuenga Sunset Building on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard fled to the
roof while firefighters entered the building and hosed down the fire.
   No injuries were reported.
   After the blaze was doused, firefighters rappelled to the roof
from a hovering helicopter and escorted people down the stairs from
the upper floors.
   ``Everything's out and everything's OK,'' said Wells. ``That's
the bottom line.''
   The cause of the fire, which was contained to the ninth floor,
was being investigated.
   Among the building's tenants are the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers; Cable News Network; Paramount
Pictures; Actors Equity Association; radio stations KJOI and KIQQ
and a modeling agency.
   The fire broke out as renovation continued on the 62-story First
Interstate Bank building, where a spectacular May 4 fire on the 12th
through 16th floors killed one person and injured 40.

   The U.S. dollar rose for the third consecutive day
against the Japanese yen Thursday in Tokyo.
   The dollar ended the year's trading at 126.03 yen, up 0.76 yen
from Wednesday's close and up 4.03 yen from its 1987 year-end
closing. It had opened Thursday at 125.42 yen.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange finished its last trading day of the
year Wednesday and will be closed through Jan. 3.
   An exchange dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar
``strengthened after the market interpreted Wednesday's intervention
by the West German Bundesbank as a signal of concern over
inflation.''
   The Bundesbank was reported to have sold about $100 million in
support of the West German mark during Wednesday's trading, the
official said, speaking anonymously.
   He said, however, that the dollar and yen were likely to remain
around the same levels for the remainder of the year due to sparse
staffing of dealing offices in Japan and elsewhere prior to the New
Year holiday period.

   Palestinian extremists motivated by a desire to undermine PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat's peace initiative are among the possible
suspects in the downing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Perhaps No. 1 on the list of suspects is Abu Nidal, followed by a
Palestinian faction headed by a rival to Arafat, pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslems, a group of Protestant extremists in Northern Ireland,
terrorists opposed to U.S. forces in Europe and even Mafia hitmen
for hire, terrorism experts say.
   ``Abu Nidal is the top suspect because he's the most capable of
undertaking a mission of this type,'' said Ian Geldard, director of
research at the private Institute for the Study of Terrorism in
London.
   Abu Nidal heads the Fatah Revolutionary Council, a Palestinian
guerrilla group opposed to Arafat's recognition of Israel and talks
with the United States. The group, allied with Libya, has been
blamed for hijackings, bombings and assassinations since it broke
with Arafat in 1976.
   ``Such an act of terrorism by Abu Nidal would be a message to the
world that Arafat cannot bring peace to the Middle East. ... It's a
message to the United States and a slap in the face for Yasser
Arafat,'' Geldard said.
   On Tuesday, Abu Nidal's group said from Beirut that it was
``painfully saddened'' by the Dec. 21 crash of Flight 103, which
originated in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Yonah Alexander, director of the Institute for Studies in
International Terrorism at the State University of New York, said
Abu Nidal does not always take responsibility for attacks his group
has been blamed for, including the 1986 attack on a synagogue that
killed 22 people in Istanbul, Turkey.
   Abu Nidal's guerrillas also were held responsible for
commandeering a Pan Am jumbo jet the day before in Karachi,
Pakistan. About 20 people were killed.
   One alleged member of the group, Mohammed Rashid, is wanted by
the United States in the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner flying
from Tokyo to Honolulu. One person was killed and 15 injured in the
attack.
   Rashid, 39, is serving a seven-month sentence for entering Greece
with a false passport. Greece's Supreme Court last month
indefinitely postponed a decision to extradite him to the United
States.
   Alexander also speculated that pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
terrorists may have planted the bomb.
   On Dec. 22, an anonymous caller to The Associated Press in London
claimed a pro-Iranian group called Guardians of the Islamic
Revolution was responsible. The caller said the motive was revenge
for the July downing of Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf by the
USS Vincennes, which the Navy said was a case of mistaken identity.
   But U.S. officials said the group was probably was not involved.
   Geldard said the group has claimed responsibility for just one
incident: an attack on a leading Iranian dissident in London in
September 1987.
   Last week, L. Paul Bremer, director of the State Department's
office of counterterrorism, said callers claimed two other groups
were responsible. He said they were Islamic Jihad, another
pro-Iranian Shiite group; and a group of Protestant extremists in
Northern Ireland whose name he did not have.
   Geldard said other Palestinian suspects include the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, led by Ahmed
Jibril, and the May 15th Organization led by Mohammad Amri.
   The Popular Front was the first terrorist organization to bomb an
airliner in flight when it attacked a Swiss airliner in 1970, he
said. Forty-seven people were killed.
   Geldard said the group is closely associated with Syria, whose
president, Hafez Assad, may ``feel that he has been marginalized
from the Middle East peace process.''
   Ariel Merari, a senior researcher in terrorism at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said Jibril's
group often uses tourists and other unsuspecting carriers to plant
its bombs.
   He said a sophisticated bomb was found concealed in a radio when
13 members of the group were detained in October in raids in West
Germany.
   Geldard said the May 15th Organization was responsible for the
attack on a TWA airliner over the Mediterranean in April 1986 that
killed four peole and injured nine.
   Alexander said European terrorists, including the Red Army
Faction, may have staged the Pan Am attack to press their demands to
pull U.S. forces out of West Germany.
   Other possibile culprits include Mafia assassins ``recruited by
Libya or Syria to perpetrate this kind of crime,'' he said. ``They
use these soldiers of fortune, terrorists for hire, to erase any
footsteps.''

   William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and other
starship Enterprise crew members gathered in Hollywood to toast
completion of nearly all filming for the movie ``Star Trek V: The
Final Frontier.''
   With only a few special-effects sequences left to be filmed, cast
members on Wednesday sipped a mixture of champagne and green melon
liqueur.
   Joining Shatner, who plays Capt. James T. Kirk, and Nimoy, who
plays Mr. Spock, were DeForrest Kelley (Dr. Leonard ``Bones''
McCoy), Walter Koenig (Ensign Pavel Chekov) and James Doohan
(Engineer Montgomery ``Scotty'' Scott).
   The subtitle,``The Final Frontier,'' doesn't mean that's the end
of the voyages of the Enterprise.
   Doohan says the actors have been signed up for ``Star Trek VI,''
and that the producer's services have been enlisted all the way to
``Star Trek VII.''

   Despite continuing improvement in his
condition, country music star Johnny Cash will spend another week or
so at the hospital where he underwent double bypass surgery last
week, a spokeswoman says.
   The 56-year-old performer's condition was upgraded Wednesday from
critical but stable to satisfactory, said Baptist Hospital
spokeswoman Aileen Katcher.
   ``He will remain in the intensive care unit until next week for
observation,'' Ms. Katcher said, and probably be released sometime
next week.
   The precaution is not standard in such cases, but is not unusual
either, she said.
   Generally speaking, Cash ``is doing a lot better,'' Ms. Katcher
said. ``He was up and walking around again today.''
   Cash began having lung problems during the weekend after the
surgery, but Ms. Katcher said they were under control.

   The National Enquirer says it stands by its
report that the mother of singer Engelbert Humperdinck's daughter
fears he is ``battling the AIDS virus.''
   The newspaper issued its statement Wednesday, a day after
Humperdinck filed a $50 million-plus libel lawsuit against it,
saying the story in this week's editions was false and malicious.
   ``The article, written and researched with extreme care, was
based on court papers filed in New York's Family Court,'' the
tabloid said in a statement from its Lantana, Fla., headquarters.
   ``The headline, `Mother of His Child Claims in Court ...
Engelbert Has AIDS Virus,' is totally accurate,'' the statement
said. ``It was published only after being closely reviewed by our
legal counsel.''
   The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court says the
entertainer doesn't have and never had acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, and has never tested positive for the virus.
   Kathy Jetter filed papers in New York City's Family Court
demanding that Humperdinck, 52, provide for the financial future of
her 12-year-old daughter, already ruled by a court to be his
daughter.
   The woman's unsubstantiated and false claims about the
entertainer in a reply affidavit in the case were ultimately
dismissed by the New York court, Humperdinck's lawsuit said.
   The National Enquirer is a weekly supermarket tabloid that boasts
the largest circulation of any paper in America.

   ``Thirtysomething'' star Ken Olin will wind
up in court in an episode of the TV show that's set here. But he'll
be carrying a basketball, wearing a Philadelphia 76ers uniform and
playing with Charles Barkley.
   Olin makes the winning dunk in the dream sequence filmed
Wednesday at the Los Angeles Forum, but needed a 7-foot ramp to do
it.
   In the show, Olin's character, Michael, suffers a loss of
self-esteem, and dreams of playing for the 76ers. His friend
Elliott, played by Tim Busfield, also appears in the dream, along
with players Mike Gminski, Maurice Cheeks and Barkley and Coach Jim
Lynam.
   Olin said the filming ``was incredible for me. I went to the
University of Pennsylvania so I kind of grew up watching the
Sixers.''
   The episode will be broadcast Jan. 24, said 76ers spokesman Dave

   Whether the name Gallo is a trademark or a
legitimate name that a person can use on products was debated by
attorneys representing rival members of the winemaking family.
   An attorney for Joseph Gallo, 67, argued Wednesday that his
client has a perfect right to label cheese he manufactures with his
full name, but an attorney for E&J Gallo, the world's largest
winery, contended Gallo is a trademark name that cannot be used
without the winery's permission.
   ``The record clearly established that the name Gallo long since
stopped being a family name and became a trademark of considerable
significance,'' winery counsel Patrick Lynch said in his closing
argument in a trademark infringement trial. ``The name Gallo is
virtually synonymous with a brand of wine.''
   The winery is owned by Gallo's brothers Ernest, 79, and Julio, 77.
   Defense counsel Denis Rice said if the winery wins, it would be
the only case so far as he knows where a ``person using his full
name ... would be precluded from using it on a non-competing
product.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Coyle is expected to issue a ruling in
March.

   A 250-foot cargo ship with 11 people sank in rough
seas off the mid-Atlantic coast late Wednesday, leaving at least one
person missing after he slipped through his life jacket during a
rescue, authorities said.
   A merchant ship rescued two other crew members, the Coast Guard
said early Thursday.
   After searching the Atlantic for two hours, a Coast Guard jet
spotted a life raft with an unknown number of survivors. A
helicopter was dispatched to assist, said Coast Guard Petty Officer
Kenneth Arbogast.
   ``There were people on the raft waving flashlights, but we don't
know how many,'' he said.
   The crew of the Lloyd Bermuda abandoned ship in two rafts about 7
p.m. when the ship's load shifted, causing the vessel to sink about
160 miles south of Nantucket and 200 miles off New Jersey, said
Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Jonathan Trumble.
   Searchers were hampered by 40- to 45-mph winds and 20- to 25-foot
seas. Despite the heavy seas and poor visibility, Arbogast said the
crew's chances of survival were good.
   A merchant vessel, the Eagle, which was nearest to the Lloyd
Bermuda when the ship went down, was guided to one of the rafts by a
Coast Guard plane, said Coast Guard Lt. Paul Wolf.
   Two Lloyd Bermuda crew members were pulled aboard the Eagle, said
Wolf, who earlier reported that at least three were saved.
   ``The Eagle recovered two and in the process of trying to get the
third guy on board, he slipped through the life jacket and back into
the water and they can't see him now,'' Wolf said early Thursday. He
said didn't know about the others.
   Two helicopters, a jet from the Coast Guard air station on Cape
Cod and a C-130 aircraft from Elizabeth City, N.C., arrived in the
vicinity about 10:20 p.m. and immediately began the search. But the
helicopters ran low on fuel after about 90 minutes and returned to
Cape Cod, Trumble said.
   When the life raft was sighted about 12:15 a.m., another
helicopter was sent out, Arbogast said.
   The Lloyd Bermuda, registered in Cyprus, is a container ship that
makes a regular weekly passage from New York to Bermuda, Arbogast
said. He said it probably was carrying textiles, rubber and various
small goods.
   He said the Lloyd Bermuda's captain sent a distress signal at
7:10 p.m. and lost communication about five minutes later.

<HEAD>Models Angered by Nude Art Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Controversy over Beijing's first exhibition of
nude paintings has taken a new turn with models theatening to sue an
art institute for exposing them to the public eye.
   Reporters for the official China Youth News told The Associated
Press today that two of the six nude models of the Central Fine Arts
Institute will file suit because the institute did not obtain their
permission to allow a publishing house to print postcards and a book
of paintings sold at the exhibition.
   The 18-day exhibition at the China Art Gallery opened Dec. 22 and
has drawn crowds of 10,000 a day, many of them young men willing to
pay 10 times the usual admission price for their first look at
officially sanctioned nude art.
   The reporters said the models also stayed off the job Monday, a
claim denied by an official at the Fine Arts Institute.
   Chinese sources also said that the husband of one of the models
was seeking a divorce after learning his wife had been posing in the
nude without his knowledge. Another woman is also facing marital
difficulties because of the show, they said.
   The painting of nudes has traditionally had a very minor role in
Chinese art history, and the use of nude models was banned for a
long time under Communist China's puritanical commissars of art.
   Modeling in the nude was revived in 1984, but women models have
often been subject to social ostracism. The official press earlier
this year carried stories of a female model at the Nanking Institute
of Fine Arts who went insane after neighbors accused her of being a
prostitute.
   The English-language China Daily said Wednesday that one model
for the Beijing exhibition was so terrified her husband would find
out about her secret job that she kept him away from home so he
wouldn't see the opening day of the event on the television news.
   Models at the Fine Arts Institute are paid about five times what
an average Chinese worker earns per hour.
   The show, 128 paintings by 21 artists, has drawn high praise from
people who say it is a breakthrough in Chinese society's ability to
differentiate art from pornography.
   It has also been criticized by others who say the paintings
appeal to the prurient interests of young Chinese and are out of
step with Chinese artistic and social values.

   A small bomb exploded under a car parked
near a Syrian Army checkpoint in Moslem west Beirut today. Police
said a pedestrian was wounded.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said the bomb went off at 8:45 a.m. in the Tarik
Jedideh residential district, about 50 yards from the checkpoint.
   No casualties were reported among the Syrian soldiers, but the
blast damaged the car and shattered windows, he said.
   The bombing came the day after a Syrian-backed Palestinian
guerrilla group claimed to have smashed a ``sabotage ring'' run by
supporters of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat that carried out bomb
attacks against the Syrians in beirut.
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in east and north Lebanon as
well as west and south Beirut under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   The Syrians are at loggerheads with Lebanon's right-wing
Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, as well as with Arafat's
Palestine Libereation Organization.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges On Inflation Concern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen today as
life insurance companies bought dollars actively ahead of the New
Year, pushing the U.S. currency up for the third consecutive day,
dealers said.
   The dollar closed at 126.03 yen, up 0.76 yen from Wednesday's
close and up 4.03 yen from its 1987 year-end closing. It opened
today at 125.42 yen.
   ``Life insurance companies are on stage,'' said Kaneo Ogino, a
dealer at Goldman, Sachs in Tokyo. He said other traders, reluctant
to make large moves ahead of the New Year, largely reacted to active
buying and selling by the life insurance firms.
   The dollar began the day on a strong note following overseas
gains due partly to intervention Wednesday in the market by the West
German Bundesbank, dealers said.
   The dollar ``strengthened after the market interpreted
Wednesday's intervention by the West German Bundesbank as a signal
of concern over inflation,'' said one dealer, speaking anonymously.
   The Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, reportedly sold
about $100 million in support of the West German mark on Wednesday,
he added.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to remain around the
current level for the remainder of the year due to current sentiment
toward the U.S. currency. It has gained 1.31 yen in the last three
days.
   ``I think it could go higher,'' Ogino said.
   The foreign exchange market in Tokyo will end 1988 trading with a
full day of business Friday and will resume trading on Jan. 4.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed for the year on Wednesday. It
will begin the New Year with a half-day session Jan. 4.

<TEXT>
   U.S. carriers using British airports were ordered
by the government to tighten security just hours after it announced
that a bomb had downed Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland.
   The directive Wednesday said especially close attention should be
paid to the handling of baggage stored in aircraft cargo bays.
   It was issued by the Department of Transport after consultation
with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which the British
agency said was ``also considering further security requirements for
U.S. airlines worldwide.''
   The decision on the same day investigators announced that a bomb
caused the Dec. 21 crash of Flight 103, killing all 259 people
aboard the Boeing 747 and at least 11 on the ground.
   Officials said evidence of the explosion, believed to have been
caused by hard-to-detect plastic explosives, was found in wreckage
from a cargo hold of the New York-bound jumbo jet.
   The Department of Transport statement said: ``We have reviewed
the security arrangements for flights by U.S. carriers in the light
of this incident, in consultation with the FAA, and are immediately
directing U.S. airlines to take additional measures in Britain, in
particular in relation to hold baggage.''
   A spokesman, who by custom was not identified, refused to
elaborate or give any details on the additional security measures it
wants taken.
   The announcement followed calls by British lawmakers and aviation
experts for increased security following the crash, Britain's worst
aviation disaster.
   ``The question that now has to be asked is how and where did a
bomb get on board?'' said David Wilshire, an aviation expert and
lawmaker from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governing
Conservative Party.
   Wilshire said there were three sources of passengers on the
flight: those who got on at Frankfurt where the flight originated;
those who joined at Heathrow Airport; and 12 in transit from other
flights.
   ``We are not therefore just talking about Heathrow or
Frankfurt,'' he said.
   The luggage of the 12 transit passengers went through the
Heathrow security system, but luggage belonging to the Frankfurt
passengers did not, although it was transferred under supervision of
Pan Am guards, said Wilshire.
   Opposition lawmakers have protested angrily that the Department
of Transport never informed British airports or travelers about a
U.S. warning of a terrorist threat to bomb a Pan Am airliner on the
Frankfurt-New York route in December.
   The government said that after receiving the threat, it had
reviewed security for U.S. flights at British airports _ which
already is higher than for some other destinations _ and decided it
was adequate.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former government ministers were
arrested today on corruption charges stemming from an investigation
into widespread abuses under former President Chun Doo-hwan,
officials said.
   Government prosecutors said Kim Chong-ho, the former construction
minister, was arrested on charges of taking bribes from construction
companies in the massive urban redevelopment projects in central
Seoul.
   Also arrested was Cha Kyu-hun, who once served as transportation
minister under Chun. Cha was charged with taking bribes from
businessmen for helping them obtain permits to build and operate
golf courses.
   Prosecutors are investigating allegations of widespread
corruption under Chun, including extortion of money from businesses,
diversion of government funds, influence peddling and forced
political donations. The National Assembly is investigating
corruption and human rights abuses under Chun.
   Some of Chun's relatives and associates have been arrested or
convicted of corruption, but it was the first arrest of former Chun
ministers. The former ministers are also ex-generals.
   There have been allegations the former president collected
illicit political donations through the licensing of golf courses.
Licenses to build golf courses are highly profitable and much
sought-after.
   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but has admitted he
managed political donations.
   A former general who took power with military backing in 1980,
Chun went into voluntary rural exile last month after apologizing to
the nation for abuses under his seven-year rule, which ended in
February.
   President Roh Tae-woo, a former general and once close ally of
Chun, has asked the nation to forgive his disgraced predecessor. Roh
opposes punishing Chun, but the opposition demands the former
president appear before the National Assembly's probe into his
government.
   Opposition parties say they will not agree to consider a pardon
for Chun until he appears before National Assembly. Roh says Chun
must be forgiven to promote national unity.
   Some opposition leaders hope nationwide furor over Chun and
revelations of abuses under his rule will hurt Roh's chances of
winning a referendum sometime next year on his rule.
   Roh promised to hold the referendum after the Seoul Olympics,
which ended in October. The government is identified with Chun in
the eyes of some South Koreans and Roh, who was elected a year ago
when two candidates split the opposition vote, faces a major
challenge in winning the referendum.
   The government has not said what Roh will do if he loses the
referendum. Roh would not be obliged to resign, but a defeat would
signal a lack of public confidence and the government would be under
pressure to call elections.
   No date has been set for the referendum, which is expected in the
spring.

<HEAD>Studies Show Hormones And Drugs Improve Breast Cancer Survival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies of nearly 29,000 breast-cancer patients
leave no doubt that drug and hormone therapies improve chances of
surviving the disease, the second-leading cancer killer of American
women, researchers say.
   Analysis of 61 studies showed that a synthetic hormone called
tamoxifen improves the survival of breast cancer victims over age
50, while chemotherapy helps younger women.
   During the first five years after treatment, tamoxifen reduced
the odds of death among older women by about one-fifth, the analysis
revealed, while a combination of chemotherapy drugs reduced the odds
by about one-quarter for younger victims.
   The studies were started as far back as 20 years ago.
   The analysis ``has established beyond reasonable doubt that both
tamoxifen and cytotoxic chemotherapy can reduce five-year
mortality,'' the researchers wrote in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The treatments already are widely used for women after surgery to
remove breast tumors. In most of those studied, the disease had
spread to their lymph nodes but hadn't invaded other organs.
   ``There have been continued critics who argue that either
chemotherapy or tamoxifen or both used early on didn't change
survival,'' said Dr. I. Craig Henderson of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston.
   Henderson, one of 79 co-authors of the analysis, said that while
the treatments do not necessarily cure the cancer, the review shows
that ``they substantially delay death.''
   Many of the studies in the analysis were too small to clearly
demonstrate any effect from the treatments. But after their results
were combined, the impact became apparent.
   The overview method ``takes out the wrinkles from all the
studies,'' said Dr. Nicholas Robert of New England Medical Center.
``We can use conclusions with a strong statistical foundation about
the benefit and lack of benefit of treatments.''
   Breast cancer is second to lung cancer as a cancer killer of
American women. An estimated 135,000 new cases of breast cancer were
diagnosed in the United States this year, and 42,300 women died of
the disease.
   Many cancer specialists already are familiar with the findings,
since they have been presented at medical meetings during the past
three years.
   ``These data have already had a major impact on the way women are
treated in this country. Now physicians will have the actual numbers
in hand,'' said another co-author, Dr. William Wood of Massachusetts
General Hospital.
   The data were reviewed by a consensus panel of the National
Institutes of Health before it recommended in 1985 that tamoxifen
and chemotherapy be used for breast cancer that has spread to the
lymph nodes.
   Last May, the National Cancer Institute told doctors that the
treatment could be extended to women in the earliest stages of
breast cancer that is not yet evident in the lymph nodes. The
institute based its recommendation on three unpublished studies
showing that cancer was slower to return when these women were
treated after surgery to remove their tumors.
   However, that recommendation remains controversial. Some
specialists contend that tamoxifen and chemotherapy should not be
routinely given to women with very early breast cancer until there
is proof that the treatment actually makes them live longer. Others
say that even if the drugs don't lengthen survival, they still may
improve the quality of women's lives by giving them more time
without cancer.
   Chemotherapy often carries unpleasant side effects, such as
nausea and hair loss. Tamoxifen is much milder, although some women
complain of hot flashes, but its long-term effects on the body are
not known.
   Many doctors are reluctant to subject all women with early breast
cancer to these powerful medicines, especially when many will remain
free of cancer with surgery alone.
   The analysis was organized by Dr. Richard Peto of Oxford
University and combined the results of 61 comparison studies,
conducted mostly in Europe and North America, on 28,896 women. The
researchers sought out all the studies that had been conducted,
including those that found no benefit of treatment, since these are
less likely than positive studies to be published in medical
journals.
   ``We wanted the whole story,'' said Wood. ``The goal was to be
comprehensive.''

   San Francisco gave out wool-lined coats and long underwear to
hundreds of homeless as Californians shivered in a cold spell today
that apparently killed three, including a transient in an avocado
grove near President Reagan's ranch. Hurricane-force winds wreaked
havoc in the East.
   Gusts up to 77 mph Wednesday triggered the collapse of a
Philadelphia factory roof that killed two people, hampered efforts
to rescue the 11-man crew of a cargo ship that sank in rough seas
off New Jersey and blew off part of the roof of an airport terminal
near Baltimore, authorities said. More than 350,000 buildings lost
power.
   The fast-moving cold front that brought the winds to the East
left snow in the Midwest, where four people died after shoveling
snow in Indiana. Two jets skidded off runways at Greater Cincinnati
International Airport, which shut down for an hour Wednesday.
   California's cold spell entered its third day today with frost
and freeze warnings for another round of temperatures in the teens,
20s or 30s in effect in many sections of the state, and in Arizona.
   ``We won't get any warmer until Saturday or Sunday,'' said Craig
Peterson of the National Weather Service.
   Authorities said the cold was suspected in the deaths of the
transient found Tuesday in the avocado orchard near Reagan's ranch
in the Santa Ynez Mountains northwest of Los Angeles, another man
found Tuesday in his unheated home in the Los Angeles suburb of
Glendale and a man who turned up Monday in downtown Los Angeles clad
only in his underwear.
   The homeless fought off the cold by huddling together outdoors or
taking refuge in packed emergency shelters.
   In downtown San Francisco, dozens of transients crawled into
sleeping bags or flimsy cardboard shelters.
   ``It takes at least four blankets and still you can't stay
warm,'' said Vincente Jones, who is 29 and homeless.
   The city is giving away 700 wool-lined raincoats and long
underwear to help ward off the cold, said Deputy Mayor Myra Snyder.
   In Los Angeles, Skid Row shelters have been packed for a week.
City buses took the overflow to 25 temporary shelters at county
parks and National Guard armories.
   Growers statewide fired up smudge pots, switched on wind machines
and flooded irrigation canals with warm water to ward off the cold
that threatened citrus crops, avocados and nursery stock.
   The weather also triggered several serious accidents.
   In Southern California's high desert, a motorist distracted by a
rare blanket of snow hit a guardrail, killing her 80-year-old
passenger, authorities said. A tanker truck skidded on icy
Interstate 5 near Redding in northern California, smashed into cars
and blew up in a fireball, causing two minor injuries.
   The winds that tore through the East were clocked at 77 mph in
Baltimore, 67 mph in Martinsburg, W.Va., and 60 mph in Newark, N.J.,
and Elizabeth City, N.C.
   The wind knocked out power to 185,000 customers in the Baltimore
area, 100,000 in the Washington area, 31,000 in Delaware, nearly
11,000 in New Jersey and at least 31,400 in New York state.
   Winds of 40-45 mph and 20- to 25-foot seas hampered efforts to
rescue 11 seamen who abandoned the cargo ship Lloyd Bermuda before
it sank 200 miles east of New Jersey, authorities said. Rough seas
and a shifting load were believed to have caused the sinking.
   In Philadelphia, two people were killed when sections of a
factory roof crumbled and smashed into their cars, said a witness,
the Rev. Robert Falkenstein. The wind helped cause the roof to give
way, city Licenses and Inspections Commissioner Don S. Kligerman.
   At Baltimore-Washington International Airport, the wind tore off
part of the roof of the main terminal, blew out two large windows
and damaged other buildings, said airport advertising manager Bob
Ware. There were no injuries.
   The wind dropped trees and debris onto houses and into evening
rush-hour streets, stalling traffic in Baltimore.
   Four vacant buildings collapsed and roofs were torn off five
houses and several buildings in the Baltimore area. Seven buildings
collapsed in Fairfax County, Va., near Washington.
   Flying debris hit three people in New York City, causing minor
injuries. The strong winds in the East came on a day of relatively
mild temperatures. Seventy-degree readings were reported as far
north as Washington.
   ``It's a little bit crazy,'' said Tom Grant of the weather
service in New York.

   A judge has ordered a burglar who carries
the AIDS virus to stay home and refrain from sex for five years.
   District Judge Lewis O. Lauve said a report confirmed that
Argentry Eaglin, 21, is a carrier of the virus that causes the
deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The sentence Lauve issued Tuesday for breaking probation also
included two years of house arrest under jurisdiction of the Rapides
Parish sheriff.
   House arrest, the judge said, means that Eaglin cannot leave his
home except for employment and other necessary trips.
   In June, Eaglin pleaded guilty to two counts of simple burglary
and was put on probation. He later tried to commit suicide because
he thought he had AIDS, the judge said.
   AIDS has been spread most often through sexual contact.

<TEXT>
   As part of an Iranian crackdown on
high-level corruption, a Tehran court has sentenced to death for
fraud a multimillionaire who headed an organization to help families
of the country's war dead.
   Ali Mousavi of the private Nabovvat Foundation was also ordered
by the court Wednesday to pay $17.8 million to 17 creditors,
according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored
in Nicosia.
   Tehran's First Criminal Court also convicted him of an
``illegitimate sexual act'' with a woman identified only as Azar B,
the agency reported. The couple was sentenced to 74 lashes each by
the judge, a middle-ranking clergyman identified as Hojatoleslam
Jalal Mousavi.
   IRNA did not say if the judge was related to the defendant.
   Iran's Supreme Judicial Council, headed by Ayatollah Abdulkarim
Musavi Ardebili, must ratify the sentence.
   The crackdown on corruption, which was rampant during the 8-year
war against Iraq, comes as the government moves to loosen social,
political and economic restrictions after the hardship and sacrifice
of the war years.
   It also is aimed partly at luring home tens of thousands of
educated exiles whom the Tehran hierarchy wants to help rebuild the
country.
   Ardebili has declared repeatedly that lawlessness and the
excesses of revolutionary police and the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps are among main obstacles preventing many of the
estimated 2 million emigres from returning.
   Iran's fundamentalist leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, last
month called for a campaign ``to rid the people of leech-like
elements affiliated to the government and the bazaar ... to end
rip-offs and hoarding in government and private enterprises.''
   The agency report did not say how Ali Mousavi, a former teacher,
made his millions.
   It said he set up his supposedly non-profit foundations several
years ago with capital of $147,000 and advertised their aim of
providing no-interest loans and other services to ``the families of
the martyrs.''
   ``Soon Mousavi was able not only to provide 250 million rials
($3.6 million) in loans, but to invest heavily in trade and various
businesses worth more than 2 billion rials ($29.36 million),'' IRNA
noted.
   It said Mousavi's trial, which began Oct. 8, was ``a test case
for a number of other cases involving savings and loan organizations
that mushroomed after the Islamic revolution.''
   IRNA quoted the judge as saying: ``A lot of people thought that
high-ranking officials had their hands stuck in the Nabovvat
Foundation case.
   ``But the court followed up the issue with utmost patience,
precision and fairness and, praise be to God, did not come up with
anything.''
   But he stressed: ``We are bound by Islam and the Islamic Republic
... to bring any individual on key positions, who God forbid is
involved in such issues, into this courtroom and deal with him.''
   Mousavi's conviction followed that of Toraj Mansur, former
managing director of state-run Saipa Co., which manufactures Renault
sedans. He was jailed for eight years and fined $236 million for
embezzling $115 million.
   The official media has not disclosed how effective the
anti-corruption campaign has been. But the Tehran daily Ettelat
noted in a recent editorial: ``Cases like Saipa are not rare.
   ``If the government does not translate into action its will to
purge ... renovation will remain nothing but an ideal.''
   Travelers from Tehran, including Iranian businessmen, have
reported scores of cases in which Revolutionary Guards and officials
of police revolutionary committees have demanded protection money,
or confiscated goods then demanded money for their return.
   The corruption crackdown coincides with new moves to stamp out
drug smuggling and abuse, widespread in Iran, and to curb
profiteering.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Link Between Mood and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moods of anger and depression have been implicated
in chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating weakness sometimes
called the ``yuppie disease,'' according to a report today.
   ``It is possible that mood itself is one of the factors in the
development of this syndrome,'' said Dr. Stephen E. Straus. ``People
who have certain emotional makeups may be more predisposed to get
this syndrome than others.''
   Doctors have searched unsuccessfully for a viral cause of the
illness, which is especially likely to afflict well-off young
professionals. A theory that it results from the Epstein-Barr virus,
which causes mononucleosis, has largely been abandoned.
   Some doctors had noticed that acyclovir, a drug used against
Epstein-Barr virus, seemed to relieve the syndrome. The latest study
was conducted to see if it worked.
   The researchers found that those who took acyclvir frequently
improved, but so did a comparison group that received placebos.
   The study found that the only factor that could clearly be linked
to improvement was mood. As people's moods improved _ especially
their feelings of anger and depression _ their fatigue also lessened.
   Straus said the latest findings do not mean that the syndrome is
imaginary. Instead, the symptoms may be caused by the influence of
people's moods on their hormones and immune defenses.
   ``I think it is very possible that a person's psychological
makeup could have a real impact on the expression of diseases,'' he
said.
   He noted that people with some personality types appear to be
less likely to survive heart attacks or cancer.
   ``You have to ask how that would work,'' he said. ``It's possible
that there is a psycho-immunological or metabolic link, and that may
exist in this syndrome, as well.''
   The latest study, directed by Straus at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was published in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Twenty-seven adults took part in the study. Neither they nor the
researchers knew whether they were getting acyclovir or dummy drugs.
Of the 24 who finished the study, 11 who took acyclovir and 10 who
took placebos said they felt better.
   In most of them, the perception of improvement lasted two or
three weeks after the treatment ended. However, four said their
improvement lasted for at least a year. Three of these four had
received placebos.
   Many of the patients were surprised by the study's results. Some
were relieved, others dismissed the findings.
   Straus said that some of the results are reassuring. For
instance, the research found that people with the syndrome do not
grow steadily worse. Instead, the symptoms come and go and can
disappear for years.
   The link between mood and the syndrome is controversial. The
study does not prove that people get better because their moods
improved. In fact, Straus said that the opposite might be true.
   ``It could not be determined whether their moods improved because
they felt better or they felt better because their moods improved,''
said Straus. ``Both are possible.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Morton N. Swartz of
Massachusetts General Hospital said it's likely that the syndrome
will prove to have mental and physical causes.
   Straus said that even though the illness has been formally
recognized as a syndrome, it is not new. He said there are accounts
of similar afflictions in the medical literature dating to the 1700s.

   A little girl who called the 911
emergency telephone number to find out why Santa Claus missed her
home got a late Christmas delivery from some of his law-and-order
elves.
   The call from 8-year-old Brenda Cervantes came in Tuesday
afternoon, said police Sgt. Richard Grodt in this Los Angeles suburb.
   ``A little girl came on and said she wanted to know where Santa
was because mommy told her Santa didn't come to the house because he
was helping the Police Department,'' Grodt said.
   The girl, one of four children, made the call while her mother
was seeing a doctor, Grodt said.
   When police called back later to talk to the mother about her
daughter using the emergency telephone number they learned that the
family was financially burdened.
   The department raised $175. Gifts were purchased and delivered
Wednesday morning to the family's apartment, Grodt said.

   Hazelnut growers can't wait to get cracking on
a new promotion to make Oregon the only state with an official nut.
   Government and industry representatives said Wednesday that
Oregon's dominance in the nation's hazelnut production needs more
recognition.
   Oregon already has a state fish, rock, dance and flower. And
Richard Fritz, an assistant director of the state Agriculture
Department, said lawmakers in 1989 will be asked to designate the
hazelnut as Oregon's official nut.
   He said Oregon in 1987 produced 21,000 tons of hazelnuts, or 98
percent of the domestic harvest. Washington state grows the rest of
the domestic crop of hazelnuts, which are also called filberts,
Fritz said.
   The crop generated $20.5 million for Oregon's economy last year
and has yielded up to $38 million annually, he said.
   The Hazelnut Marketing Board in Portland says the state has more
than 1,100 hazelnut growers tending 3.2 million trees on 25,000
acres.
   Fritz said the designation of an official nut is likely to be the
brunt of jokes. But that will help increase recognition of the crop,
Fritz said.
   ``I'm sure it will bring smiles to some faces, but that's what
you want,'' he said.

<HEAD>Former Marine Awarded Vietnam Medals 22 Years Late</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   While his friends' fathers had medals to prove
they had served in Vietnam, Marty Kehoe's dad couldn't produce the
goods, even though he is a former Marine with a distinguished
service record in Southeast Asia.
   But on Wednesday he got the proof he needed. Marty's father,
Chicago police Patrolman Martin Kehoe, was given four ribbons and
four medals for his service as a Marine fighting in Da Nang and Chu
Lai in 1965 and 1966.
   ``I'm proud of my father,'' said Marty Kehoe, 14. ``Now I know he
was really doing something in the war.''
   With his wife and three children watching, the elder Kehoe, 44,
was given the awards and a special plaque by Marine Lt. Gen. Charles
Pitman at a brief ceremony at O'Hare International Airport, where
Kehoe is assigned.
   ``It really felt good to finally get them, in front of the family
with the kids being there,'' said Kehoe, a 17-year police veteran.
   ``A lot of us were over there, and not a lot of us were
recognized for what went on.''
   Col. Cary Kelly, commanding officer of the Marine Corps reserve
group at Glenview Naval Air Station, said Kehoe should have been
decorated by his unit soon after earning the honors. But he said
awards are sometimes put off when servicemen are in the field or on
assignments that make ceremonies impractical.
   Kehoe said he mentioned the missing medals to Pitman last month
after Marty Jr., who had been studying the Vietnam War in school
this year, asked him why he didn't have any medals to prove he had
fought there.
   ``He was asking me about (Vietnam),'' Kehoe said. ``He's got some
friends whose dads were there and they had medals.''
   Kehoe said he had brought up the long-delayed awards when he
chatted with Pitman in early November while on assignment
accompanying the general at the airport.
   ``It was just kind of like a fluke,'' Kehoe said. ``I ran into
this guy, he was a general, and he went to Washington to look up my
record. And he was nice enough to come back and give (the awards) to
me.''
   Pitman said that while he does not normally deal with such
matters, he was touched by Kehoe's story about his son.
   ``He had a good record,'' Pitman said. ``He was a good Marine _ a
fine guy who served his country well _ and we're proud to honor him.
... I know his son certainly appreciated it.''
   Pitman, the Marines' deputy chief of staff for aviation in
Washington, said such delays were not unusual.
   ``We still get requests for verification of awards from World War
II and the Korean War,'' he said.
   Pitman said he gave Kehoe, who was a corporal when he left active
duty, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Meritorious Unit Citation, the
Good Conduct Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the National Defense
Service Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, the Vietnamese
Campaign Medal, and a Vietnamese unit citation.

<TEXT>
   City officials appealed today for an end to
the daily anti-black demonstrations that have followed a Christmas
Eve fight between African students and Chinese. The embattled
Africans remained sequestered.
   Two foreign reporters were barred from talking with the roughly
140 African students, who were being held under virtual house arrest
in a guest house 1{ hours by car outside this east-central city.
   The Africans, accompanied by students from Pakistan, Nepal,
Bangladesh, Japan and Western Europe, were not allowed to make
telephone calls or leave the guest house other than to return to
their universities in Nanking.
   Chinese police forced virtually all of Nanking's black African
students to the guest house Monday after thousands of Chinese
marched through the city's streets throwing rocks and destroying
property at the African students' dormitories.
   The Chinese youth chanted ``down with black devils'' and ``black
devils go home.''
   The Africans, fearing for their lives, tried to leave for
Beijing, but were stopped Sunday by armed police at Nanking's train
station.
   The clash and demonstrations are the latest in a series of
incidents between Chinese and the 1,500 African students invited
here to show Beijing's solidarity with the Third World.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, asked in Beijing whether
Nanking authorities had the right to hold the African students,
called ``groundless'' charges that the Africans were being held
illegally.
   Li added, ``The incident that has occurred in Nanking is an
isolated one having nothing to do with racial discrimination.''
   He said students from 40 African nations are studying in China
and, ``They always get on quite well with the Chinese students. Of
course, because of the difference of the customs of life, it is
sometimes unavoidable for some misunderstanding and even something
unpleasant.''
   Today, the only African student to leave the guest house and
return to Nanking said he wanted to leave China as soon as possible.
   ``I am very fearful,'' said a 23-year-old from Comoros who
identified himself only as Bourhane in an interview in his dormitory
at Nanking Polytechnical Institute. ``I won't leave this building.
Even seeing a Chinese outside the window makes me cold with fright.''
   In a front-page editorial, the Xinhua Daily, Nanking's largest
newspaper, urged students to stop demonstrating. Students, youths
and workers have been marching by the thousands since the Saturday
night fight between Chinese officials and students who refused to
register the names of their Chinese female companions they were
taking to a campus party.
   Eleven Chinese were reported injured, including one critically.
   On Wednesday, more than 2,000 youths jammed a major city
intersection as hundreds of police gathered nearby. Riot police
charged the crowd sporadically, hitting youths with rubber
truncheons.
   Other police placed demonstrators in an unmarked van.
   American witnesses said protests earlier this week were highly
racist in nature, with Chinese yelling, ``Kill the black devils!''
   In demonstrations Tuesday and Wednesday night, however, Chinese
began calling on the government to punish those involved in the
fight, ``according to the law.''
   ``In the beginning it was `down with the black devils,' but we're
not calling for that,'' said Lin Min, a 23-year-old Nanking
University student. ``We want matters to be settled according to
law.''
   At the guest house, at a chemical fiber factory to the northwest,
Chinese officials refused to let Western reporters talk with the
students.

<HEAD>Boston Adopts New School Enrollment Plan After Years Of Forced
Busing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 14 years of court-ordered busing that
triggered riots and white flight, the city has approved a school
assignment plan that allows parents to shop around for schools
closer to home.
   ``Clearly, it's time for change,'' school Superintendent Laval S.
Wilson said at a meeting Wednesday night in which the Boston School
Committee endorsed 10-1 the new student assignment plan in
principle. Two committee members did not vote.
   The panel stopped short of full approval. It ordered Wilson to
complete a review of the plan, which was devised by consultants, and
develop ways to put it into effect, at least in part, by September.
   The plan would split the school system into three zones of 14,000
parents each, with parents permitted to choose any school in their
zone. Students would be allowed to go to the school unless the
racial balance was upset. If a school was oversubscribed, a lottery
would be held, said School Committee President John Nucci.
   Backers say the plan would cut the long bus rides many students
now endure. They also hope the resulting inter-school competition
will spur improvements and lure back whites who fled to private
schools or the suburbs when the desegregation order was imposed in
1974.
   Critics say the plan won't work without more money and that it
would hurt some people, such as those without access to special
magnet schools. Boston school woes include rundown buildings, a
perennial budget crunch and a 40 percent high-school dropout rate.
   ``Nowhere in this plan do I see a commitment from this city to
pay for choice,'' said Jean McGuire, one of the two abstaining
committee members.
   Nucci said he doesn't believe money will make or break the plan.
   The 1974 desegregation order by U.S. District Judge W. Arthur
Garrity Jr., stemmed from a 1972 lawsuit filed by black parents who
said their children were receiving lower quality education than that
at predominantly white schools.
   In 1975, Garrity imposed the busing plan, triggering
rock-throwing protests.
   ``We've put that kind of violence and racial strain behind us,''
committeeman John P. Grady said. ``We want all of our children to
have the best education we can give them. As a city, we've grown
up.''
   When the lawsuit was filed, public schools served 96,000
students, 60 percent white. Today there are 59,000 students, but
only 24 percent are white, although whites comprise 60 percent of
Boston's population. Forty-eight percent of students are black, 19
percent are Hispanic and 8 percent are Asian.
   As a result, some schools effectively have been resegregated, and
nearly 90 percent of their pupils belong to minority groups, Grady
said.
   Garrity returned some control of the system to the committee in
1985. Two years later, a federal appeals court ruled that Boston
schools had integrated and that increased minority influence would
prevent a return to segregated classrooms.
   Garrity has since left the bench. His orders require only that a
racial balance be maintained, freeing the committee to come up with
a plan of its own.
   Any change in the student assignment plan would require approval
by the state Board of Education.
   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, who once was a fervent busing foe,
supports the plan. He has said that schools could tap into existing
funds to help fund it.
   Wilson said he did not know how much the new plan might cost, but
said he expected there would be a request for funds.

   Social Security officials say a quadriplegic
who won a seat in the Legislature has been warned he could lose his
medical benefits if he takes his newly won seat and begins drawing
expense reimbursements.
   Bill Boharski, a Kalispell Republican, defeated Democrat Gordon
Hall in November, to win his first term in the Montana House.
   But after drawing expense reimbursements for attending
legislative caucuses in November, Boharski said he was notified the
reimbursements were ``unearned income'' that would make him
ineligible for continued medical benefits under Medicare and
Medicaid.
   And Boharski, who is paralyzed from injuries he suffered in an
automobile accident five years ago, says he can't afford to lose the
money. He estimates his medical expenses at $15,000 a year.
   ``That put me in a position where I had to seriously consider
whether or not I had to resign my position,'' the 27-year-old
legislator-elect said. ``That amount of medical bills isn't
something you can just pay.''
   Boharski said the situation is not desperate because state and
federal officials are trying to help.
   Legislative leaders say they're considering a change in state
compensation law to redefine the reimbursements, and Boharski said
Social Security has advised him the case is under review. Boharski
also said he will ask Congress for help if need be.
   Montana legislators earn $52.13 for each working day in the
session plus $50 a day during the session as reimbursement for
living expenses in Helena. The 1989 session begins Monday.
   It's the expense reimbursement that concerns Social Security
Administration officials.
   Mark Fredenberg, operations supervisor for the agency's Kalispell
office, said that under federal law, the expense allowances are
considered unearned income.
   Social Security disability benefits are reduced by the amount of
unearned income over $20 that a person receives, he said. And a
person who loses eligibility for those payments because of unearned
income also loses eligibility for medical coverage, he said.
   Most people receiving disability payments don't work or don't
travel to work, Fredenberg noted, saying a situation such as
Boharski's arises ``very, very seldom.''
   Boharski said he checked into the federal regulations before he
filed for office last spring. He said he was told then he would
qualify for continued medical benefits if elected, under a program
that allows people to continue receiving medical coverage even if
they are working.
   Boharski said Social Security officials have since told him he
should be able to continue receiving his medical benefits. But, he
said, he hasn't yet received written verification. Fredenberg said
he could not comment directly on Boharski's case because of federal
privacy laws.
   Boharski said if legislation at the state level doesn't resolve
the problem, he will try to have changes made at the federal level
so he can retain his legislative seat.
   ``I'm counting on staying,'' he said. ``Anyone who knows me knows
I don't quit that easy.''

<HEAD>Sakharov's Wife Says Gorbachev OK'd Ethnic Peace Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a close
confidant approved a trip to Armenia and Azerbaijan by Andrei
Sakharov to seek a compromise in the republics' bitter ethnic
dispute, the human rights activist's wife said today.
   Yelena Bonner said in a telephone interview that she and her
husband, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, were in a five-member
delegation that visited the capitals of the southern republics and
Stepanakert, the largest city in the region at the center of the
dispute.
   She said the group returned to Moscow on Monday and may make
another trip to the region, which has been wracked by 10 months of
violence. Armenia demands annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a
predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
   Bonner said the mission had the backing of Gorbachev and
Alexander Yakovlev, the member of the ruling Politburo considered
closest to Gorbachev.
   Asked whether the officials or Sakharov, a 67-year-old nuclear
physicist, proposed the mission, and how the leaders had expressed
their backing, Bonner said: ``If he wanted to publicize this, he
would.''
   Gorbachev's approval of the Sakharov mission, however, is further
evidence of the gaining official stature of a man exiled to the
closed city of Gorky in 1980 for criticizing the Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan.
   In December 1986, Gorbachev telephoned Sakharov and said he could
return to Moscow. Sakharov was restored to good graces at the
Academy of Sciences and has been quoted frequently in the official
press.
   Bonner declined to say who the group met with during its trip or
what was discussed.
   The mission was aimed at resolving a protracted dispute over
control of Nagorno-Karabakh. The district has been part of
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan since 1923. Armenians, who are
mostly Christian, insist that the region should be annexed to the
Armenian republic.
   The central government has refused to side with the Armenians,
and strikes, riots and demonstrations have plagued both republics
since February.
   Gorbachev has said the dispute threatens his reform effots and
has expressed anger at activists who continually raise the issue.
   During a visit to the United States earlier this month, Sakharov
proposed a compromise. He recommended that Nagorno-Karabhk be taken
out of Azerbaijani hands and placed temporarily under a central
administration. Sakharov has also called for U.N. observers to
investigate the ethnic unrest.
   In the Armenian capital of Yerevan, Vigen Sarkisyan, a journalist
for the Communist Party newspaper Kommunist, said Sakharov ``tried
to find compromises'' in a meeting with Armenian scientists at their
Academy of Sciences. None of the scientists familiar with the
meeting was available today, said an academy secretary.
   Rafael Popoyan, a former Armenian political prisoner and literary
critic, said by telephone from Yerevan that Sakharov also visited a
center for Armenians who fled Azerbaijan because of violence in
connection with the territorial dispute. At least 60 people have
been killed.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, asked about the
trip Wednesday, said, ``As far as I know he went there as a member
of a group of academics and scholars. That trip had nothing to do
with any authority whatsoever.''
   In Nagorno-Karabakh, the group met with the Kremlin's negotiator
in the ethnic dispute, Arkady Volsky, according to Popoyan.
   It appeared the group's ostensible reason for visiting the region
was to review conditions at a controversial nuclear power plant near
Yerevan, Popoyan said. The Soviet leadership has asked the Academy
of Sciences to study the power station.
   Many Armenians feared the plant was damaged in the Dec. 7
earthquake, which claimed about 55,000 lives and left a half million
people homeless.
   Soviet officials have repeatedly said the plant, which is built
on a fault, was not damaged. Nevertheless, Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov says it will be closed in two years because of the
earthquake danger.

<HEAD>Judge Signs Order Selling PTL Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL has officially been sold to Toronto
real estate investor Stephen Mernick, but spurned suitors for the
television ministry have left the door open to appeal the decision.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds signed an order Wednesday
formally selling the assets of the Christian ministry to Mernick for
$65 million. That gives Mernick 11 days to come up with a $3.25
million deposit and 41 days until he can assume administration and
operation of PTL.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy court since June 1987, three months
after its founder, Jim Bakker, resigned in a sex and money scandal.
   The Rev. Sam Johnson, pastor of Heritage Village Church at PTL
and president of Heritage Ministries, told said he hasn't given up
his hope to buy Fort Mill, S.C.-based PTL.
   Last week, Johnson said PTL's independent religious arm would
continue to raise money in case Mernick's deal falls through. He
said Mernick, through extensions, could delay the closing until
September.
   ``We plan to buy Heritage USA,'' Johnson said of PTL's Christian
retreat. ``That's been our plan all along. Heritage USA has not been
sold. No money has changed hands. We don't know that Mr. Mernick
will follow through and put the money down. Obviously, nothing's
been sold.''
   Johnson said Heritage Ministries has raised $5.4 million, which
is being held in an interest-bearing escrow account.
   If Heritage Ministries doesn't get a chance to buy PTL, the
donations but not the interest will be returned, Johnson said. He
said the interest is being used to minimize administrative costs of
handling the money.
   Charlotte broadcasting executive Cy Bahakel also may contest the
sale. Bahakel claimed he wasn't given a fair chance to beat
Mernick's bid, and his lawyer, Faison Barnes, said two weeks ago
Bahakel would appeal the order.
   On Wednesday, Barnes declined to say whether Bahakel would follow
through with an appeal. ``We have to see the order itself to know
exactly what we plan to do,'' he said.
   Mernick, an Orthodox Jew, has said he is willing to deal with
Heritage Ministries about keeping alive Christian broadcasting on
the PTL satellite television network. He said in October that he was
interested in PTL as a real estate deal.
   The network, carried on more than 800 cable systems, is among
PTL's most valued assets. Other assets include 1,700 undeveloped
acres in northern York County, S.C.; two 500-room hotels, one of
them unfinished; and a water park.
   Once Mernick pays the balance of the $65 million, the money will
be distributed to PTL's creditors.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Fate Of Bucky, A `Super Pit Bull Dog'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some say Bucky is mutt, others say it's a
``super pit bull.'' A judge's decision on the matter ultimately
could cost the dog its life under the state's new anti-vicious-dog
law.
   Lucas County Dog Warden Thomas Skeldon said Wednesday that Bucky
apparently is a ``super pit bull'' _ part pit bull, part Rhodesian
ridgeback _ making it extremely dangerous.
   A Rhodesian ridgeback is known as an African lion hound because
of its ability to hunt lions, Skeldon said. Bucky, he said, has the
aggressiveness of a ridgeback and the tenacity of a pit bull.
   Skeldon said mixed breeding is on the rise because some people
see it as a way of circumventing Ohio's new vicious-dog law, which
was passed in 1987 after a Dayton-area doctor was fatally attacked
by two pit bulls. The law singles out only pit bulls.
   ``We can foresee larger pit bulls coming into the pound, and pit
bull crosses with larger breeds. We've never seen one this large
before,'' Skeldon said about Bucky, who weighs about 90 pounds.
   ``We hear there's an attempt to cross pit bulls with breeds so
that it doesn't look like a pit bull, and there also is the tendency
to breed the dog with a larger animal. This is frightening,'' he
said.
   County deputy dog wardens on Dec. 15 confiscated Bucky, who is
licensed, after the dog was seen running loose from its yard, which
had an open gate.
   Ron Cannon, a deputy dog warden, said the pound was notified by
the U.S. Postal Service, which complained that the dog chased one a
letter carrier, who had to use a spray deterrent to keep the dog at
bay.
   The owner, Amy Adkins, was cited for having a vicious dog
improperly confined and for having no liability insurance.
   Her attorney, Christopher Park, disputes Skeldon's contentions
that Bucky is a pit bull.
   ``It is my understanding that it is not a pit bull. I know the
owners say it isn't,'' he said.
   He said talking about the case would be premature because of a
Jan. 12 pretrial conference in Municipal Court.
   If a judge determines the dog is a pit bull, he can order it
destroyed.
   The previous attack classifies Bucky as a dangerous dog under the
law, but the question remains whether he is a pit bull, the only
breed listed in the state statue as a vicious dog.
   Penalities for violations involving dangerous dogs and vicious
dogs are similar, but the law requires the owner of a vicious dog to
carry proof of liability insurance, which is often difficult to
obtain.
   Skeldon said he thinks the dog is a threat to the public.
   ``I am willing to euthanize the dog if that's the case. But if I
am told by the court to return the dog to its owners, I will comply
with that also,'' he said.

Down</HEAD>

details. Picks up 6th pvs, `Hasegawa, 76 ...' TRIMS to edit and

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said today that he
would keep his new justice minister despite the man's history of
donations from a company at the center of a stock scandal that
reaches deep into Japanese politics.
   Opposition parties demanded the resignation of Takashi Hasegawa
because he has admitted receiving donations for 12 years from
Recruit Co., which his office is probing for suspected bribery.
   Hasegawa was named to the justice portfolio on Tuesday as
Takeshita reshuffled his Cabinet and launched an ethics reform drive
in a bid to put the Recruit scandal behind him.
   But Takeshita's attempts to restore confidence in his government
seemed to be falling apart Wednesday night when the justice minister
confirmed he had taken money from Recruit.
   Takeshita, after consulting leaders of his Liberal Democratic
Party, said he would keep Hasegawa even though the new justice
minister had not been prudent in accepting the donations.
   ``But I fully trust that his ability will allow him to fulfill
his responsibility as justice minister,'' Takeshita said.
   Hasegawa, 76, told a news conference this afternoon he had
learned only Wednesday that Recruit Co. had been paying membership
dues since 1976 in an organization called Hakusenkai, which helps
finance Hasegawa's campaign and political activities.
   He said it was ``truly careless'' of him not to have known about
the donations, and he apologized.
   But, he continued, ``As justice minister I don't think this
matter will be an impediment. Accordingly, I will carry out my
duties as justice minister in the future.''
   Hasegawa had told reporters Tuesday he had no links to the
Recruit Co. ``and that's why I can appear before you'' as the new
justice minister.
   But news reports Wednesday night said Recruit had been giving
money to Hasegawa for 12 years, and that the last donation had been
in October, when the Recruit scandal was front-page news every day.
The donations totaled $46,000.
   The donations were legal and quite different from the
transactions in shares of a Recruit subsidiary called Recruit-Cosmos
that so far have brought the resignations of 17 politicians and
businessmen.
   Hasegawa told a late-night news conference Wednesday that he had
asked his aides, including his son, Akira, whether they had received
Recruit-Cosmos shares, and when they said no, he felt able to take
the justice portfolio. But he said he hadn't asked whether Recruit
had given him political donations.
   Mitsuhiro Kaneko, head of the Japan Communist Party's
secretariat, told a news conference that Hasegawa should resign and
``the prime minister's responsibility in appointing him should not
be escaped as well.''
   Leaders of the Socialist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party
and the Komeito (Clean Government Party), said Hasegawa was
inappropriate to serve as justice minister.
   Prosecutors have questioned Recruit founder Hiromasa Ezoe as well
as officials of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., Japan's giant
telephone utility, about business links between Recruit and the
utility.
   The scandal has been developing since last summer, when it
emerged that Ezoe had sold bargain-priced shares in Recruit-Cosmos
to influential politicians and business figures before the shares
were listed.
   Another Recruit subsidiary gave interest-free loans to finance
some of the transactions, and when the shares were listed in 1986,
the price rose sharply and the shareholders made hefty profits.
   The sales were not illegal under the securities law but they
appeared to be ethically dubious ways for a company to give
donations above the limit of one million yen ($8,000) a year, if not
bribes, to have the officials give advantages to Recruit, a huge
conglomerate based on employment services.
   The Recruit-Cosmos subsidiary deals in real estate.
   Some of the shareholders made over $80,000 in tax-free profits.
   Heading the list of those who have resigned in the scandal is
ex-Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who repeatedly changed his
story of how an aide had used Miyazawa's name to buy Recruit-Cosmos
shares. His Dec. 9 resignation was interpreted as a sacrifice by
Takeshita.
   The most prominent casualty in the business world is Hisashi
Shinto, who resigned as chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
on Dec. 14. He had denied any involvement in an aide's purchase of
shares but some of money from the eventual sale went into Shinto's
personal bank account.

<HEAD>General Strike Idles Most Of Sudan; Coalition's Junior Partner
Quits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's main international airport and
seaport were idled and its key cities paralyzed today by a general
strike in protest of the government-decreed price hikes in basic
commodities.
   Telephone and Telex operators in Cairo, Egypt, said all lines to
Khartoum were out of order, indicating telecommunications workers
had made good their threat to join the strike and cut Sudan's links
with the outside.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi called an emergency cabinet meeting
for today, and hinted he might give in to the strikers' demands.
   Meanwhile, the governing coalition's junior partner, the
Democratic Unionist Party, quit the government Wednesday in sympathy
with the strikers. The unionists dominate the powerful
2-million-member Sudan Workers' Trade Union Federation, which called
the strike.
   The Unionists had been under grass-roots pressure for some time
to quit the government because it failed to follow through with a
plan party leader Mohammed Osman Mirghani negotiated to end a
5{-year civil war in the south.
   Mirghani handed Mahdi resignations of the six unionist cabinet
members, including Foreign Minister Hussein Suleiman Salih.
   In a statement, the Unionists called for ``a national
reconciliation government'' to roll back the price increases,
implement the peace agreement and prepare for elections.
   Cairo's Middle East News Agency said Mahdi had called on the
Sudanese not to engage in ``destruction and rioting,'' adding, ``The
democratic system is capable through its institutions to take
decisions, then study them and reform them if necessary through
democratic means.''
   On Monday, Mahdi's financially strapped government increased the
price of sugar by 600 percent and cigarettes by 50 percent and
levied a 15 percent sales tax on all commodities.
   Ministers explained the increases were to finance subsidies as
well as salary increases of 50 percent to 500 percent decreed two
days earlier for public and private employees. The edict covered 1
million government workers.
   Newspapers and the official Sudan News Agency reported that many
of the country's major cities were at a standstill today.
   Reports from Port Sudan, the principal Red Sea port, said a
strike began last Saturday and that police had arrested several
people. The shutdown apparently was to protest the government's
alleged reneging on a promise to make pay increases retroactive to
July 1. They were made effective Dec. 1.
   On Wednesday, all union workers at Khartoum International Airport
left their posts.
   Officials in Cairo said flights that normally crossed Sudanese
airspace were being rerouted because of the lack of communications
with Khartoum air traffic controllers.
   Other major central Sudan towns _ Dongola, Atbara, Wad Medani and
Sennar _were reported in complete paralysis because of the work
stoppage.
   The general strike took hold after two days of demonstrations in
the capital. Thousands remained on the streets Wednesday night. One
group, as it passed the Ministry of Information, shouted: ``The head
of the prime minister is a public demand!''
   Similar unrest in March 1985 ended the 16-year authoritarian rule
of President Gaafar Nimeiri. His defense minister led a coup in
early April that began a process leading to the return of civilian
rule a year later.

   The dollar eased against most major currencies in
quiet early European trading today, but dealers said the outlook was
bullish. Gold prices fell.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.76 yen to a closing 126.03. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 125.77 yen.
   But the dollar was lower in Europe, except against the British
pound, which was quoted at $1.7887, cheaper for buyers than $1.7900
Wednesday.
   ``There was a bit of (a dollar) surplus in the market Wednesday
in New York which brought it down and seemed to have an effect all
the way into the beginning of the Tokyo day,'' said one London
trader.
   ``But the dollar seems to have come back pretty well from that.
It's looking very resilient.''
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7862 West German marks, down from 1.7960
   _1.5127 Swiss francs, down from 1.5177
   _6.1005 French francs, down from 6.1225

   _1,317.50 Italian lire, down from 1,320.90
   _1.1940 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1963
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.75 a troy ounce,
down from $413.95 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $411 bid at noon, down from $412.25
bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.38 to close at a bid $416.07.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.06 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $6.07.

<HEAD>Report: French Girls Freed In Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two French girls held for 13 months by Abu Nidal's
Palestinian terrorist group arrived today in Libya and will be
turned over to French authorities, the state-run Libyan news agency
JANA reported.
   The news came just minutes after Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of
France said the government's efforts to win the release of the girls
were on the verge of succeeding.
   An employee in JANA's Paris office, reached by telephone, said
the release of the girls, Marie-Laure, 7, and her sister, Virginie,
6, came after an appeal from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``Following the appeal by the `Guide of the Revolution (Gadhafi)'
on the occasion of Christmas for the release of hostages detained in
Lebanon, the two little French girls Marie-Laure and Virginie have
been freed,'' the employee said, reading the JANA dispatch.
   The dispatch did not say from whence the girls arrived.
   ``The two little French girls arrived in the city of Benghazi and
measures have been taken so they can be turned over today to a
delegate of the government and their family,'' JANA said.
   Walid Khaled, spokesman for the Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, said Monday that the girls had been freed and were on their
way home. The group has since issued a series of contradictory
statements about the girls.
   ``The efforts undertaken a long time ago by the government for
the release of Marie-Laure and Virginie are on the point of
succeeding,'' Dumas said in a statement in Paris. ``A group has been
in place for several days and a special envoy, Leon Bouvier, French
ambassador, is present in Tripoli.''
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council has been holding the girls, their
mother, Jacqueline Valente, and five Belgians since they seized
their yacht last year.
   The group claimed it seized the yacht off the occupied Gaza Strip
territory of Israel and that the adult hostages were Israeli spies.
Israel denies the charge.
   Ms. Valente, who is separated from the father of Marie-Laure and
Virginie, gave birth to a third child in captivity and said in a
recent videotape that she is again pregnant.

<HEAD>Agreement Will Open Up Soviet Jewish Grave Sites, Activist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish cemeteries in the Soviet Union will be
preserved and visitors will have greater access to historical and
religious documents under a new agreement, a Jewish activist says.
   ``The Soviets have gone out of their way to work with us to
preserve many of the traditions that exist in the Soviet Union,''
City Councilman Noach Dear said Wednesday, a day after his return
from Moscow.
   Many Jewish leaders are buried in the Soviet Union, including the
founder of Hasidism, Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, or the Ba'al Shem
Tov, who is buried in the Ukrainian town of Medzhibozh, said Dear,
co-chair of the private Joint Committee for the Preservation of
Jewish Heritage in the Soviet Union.
   ``The history of the Jews is basically in the Soviet Union at the
present time,'' said Dear.
   Under the agreement with Soviet officials, cities and historical
sites that had been closed to outsiders would be opened to Jews from
around the world, Dear announced Wednesday.
   The Soviets also agreed to assist visitors and preserve Jewish
grave sites and historical documents, Dear said.
   He said the agreement also would help keep Jewish life alive in
the Soviet Union as outsiders visit the burial sites and ``give a
little life to the Jewish community that exists in many of these
cities and towns which probably have never seen outside Jewish
leaders.''
   Dear said many Jewish cemeteries and grave sites are in poor
condition and that members of the committee would return soon to the
Soviet Union to catalogue the sites.
   ``These are significant steps in a world that was closed off to
us,'' said committee co-chair Aaron D. Twerski. ``As the doors open
up and as their attitudes become more positive we will be pressing
for additional rights for Soviet Jews.''
   Another sign of improvement in the way Jews are treated under
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms is increased Soviet
Jewish emigration. In November, 2,284 Jews left the Soviet Union,
slightly lower than the 2,480 figure for October that marked the
highest monthly total since 1980 but still a high level. Soviet
authorities also have loosened restrictions on the teaching of
Hebrew and are planning a Jewish cultural center in Moscow.

   A security guard was shot during an apparent
robbery at a supermarket early today and two other employees and a
customer who hid after hearing the gunfire had to be coaxed out of
the store, police said.
   The wounded security guard, who was shot several times, was found
by another customer entering Angelo's Food Mart at about 12:20 a.m.
The customer ran to a restaurant and told an employee to summon
police.
   Police surrounded the supermarket when initial reports indicated
the gunman was still inside. Authorities established telephone
contact with the people in the store, and persuaded two men to come
outside about 3 a.m. One said he was a store employee, the other
said he was a customer, according to police.
   A woman who identified herself as a store employee locked herself
in a room at the back of the store and refused to come out, police
Lt. James MacArthur said. Police later escorted the woman out of the
store.
   Police searched the store but did not find the suspect.
   A Baylor Medical Center emergency room spokesman said no
condition was immediately available for the wounded guard.
   The woman employee told police she was in a back room when she
heard what she thought were two shots from the front of the store,
MacArthur said. The other employee and the customer also told police
they were near the back of the store when they heard what they
thought were shots. They also sought safety near the back of the
store, police said.

   Relaxed after a private quail hunting
trip, President-elect Bush was headed for Alabama today for a few
hours of fishing before buckling down to work back in Washington.
   With his inauguration about three weeks away, Bush had retreated
for three days to a 10,000-acre ranch 70 miles from Corpus Christi
for an annual stint of quail hunting.
   Bush, a keen outdoorsman, teamed up today with a friend, Ray
Scott, for some fishing on Scott's private lake at Pintlala, Ala.
Scott is founder of Bass Anglers Sportsman Society and headed Bush's
1980 presidential campaign in Alabama.
   Before leaving from Chase Naval Air Station, Bush was taking a
few minutes for a nostalgic gesture that recalled his days as a
fighter pilot in World War II.
   Bush was to sign his wife's name, Barbara, across the fuselage of
a restored TBM Avenger, a torpedo bomber of the sort he flew in the
Pacific.
   Bush, who named his planes after his then-fiancee, Barbara
Pierce, narrowly escaped death when he was shot down on a bombing
mission Sept. 2, 1944.
   Leo Nadeau of San Diego, Calif., Bush's regular tail gunner on
bombing missions, was joining Bush at the fuselage signing ceremony.
Mrs. Bush did not accompany her husband to Texas, remaining instead
in Washington to pack for the move to the White House.
   The TBM Avenger, one of about 20 of that type left in the world,
was restored by Bob Schneider, a Braniff pilot from Hawkins, Texas.
Schneider estimated the project, which he did for a hobby, cost
about $20,000.
   In Pintlala, Bush scheduled about six hours on Scott's private
lake about 15 miles from Montgomery. Scott, a conservationist and
long-time Bush supporter, said the vice president called him to
arrange the outing.
   ``We just want to get in some fishing,'' he said.
   To give him more time for fishing, Bush ordered his departure
time moved up by about two hours today.
   Bush didn't have much luck on a post-election fishing trip to
Florida, and he found quail hunting harder than in previous years
because of the dry conditions, Stephen Hart, spokesman for the
president-elect, said.
   ``They have been successful on the hunt, but not as successful as
in past years,'' he said.
   Bush didn't volunteer how many birds he had bagged, he said.
   But Bush was ``very relaxed, very upbeat,'' after the hunting,
Hart added.
   While Bush was isolated at the Lazy F Ranch, owned by his friend,
Houston millionaire Will Farish, his transition office announced
that he had selected Robert M. Gates, the No. 2 official at the CIA,
to be the new deputy director of the National Security Council.
   Bush, in a statement, called Gates, an expert on Soviet affairs,
``admirably suited for this key position.''
   Gates, a Kansas native and a career CIA employee, will report to
Brent Scowcroft, who Bush has designated as his national security
adviser. Neither job requires Senate confirmation.
   To replace Gates, Bush chose Richard J. Kerr, the CIA's current
deputy director for intelligence whose background is in East Asian
affairs. The Kerr appointment is subject to confirmation by the
Senate.
   Bush, while in Texas, was notified in advance about a British
announcement that investigators determined a bomb had caused the
crash of a Pan American World Airways plane last week, but he had no
comment on it, Hart said.
   Joining Bush on his vacation were Farish and his wife, Sarah,
James Baker III, the designated secretary of state, and his wife,
Susan, and the president-elect's brother, Jonathan Bush of New York.
   Bush has said that when he returns to the nation's capital, he
will concentrate on policy and legislative issues as well as the
budget. He still has one Cabinet job, energy secretary, to fill, and
he is looking for a drug czar, a Cabinet-level job.
   Bush has not said when another announcement will be forthcoming,
but aides indicated it could be as early as Friday.

<HEAD>Two Brothers Captured In Connection With Slaying Of Famed Ecologist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sons of a cattle rancher who
favored clearing the Amazon for grazing have been arrested in
connection with the killing of an ecologist who fought to preserve
the jungle, police say.
   Brothers Aleci and Oloci Alves da Silva were captured after a gun
battle with police Tuesday night on their family ranch in Xapuri,
the jungle town where Francisco Mendes was gunned down last week,
Deputy Minister of Justice Luis Fernando Eichenberg said. Oloci was
wounded in the shootout.
   The two are sons of Darly Alves da Silva, a rancher who was angry
over Mendes' campaign to save the rain forest. Mendes had said the
rancher threatened to kill him.
   The internationally known ecologist, who organized jungle workers
to try to stop destruction of the rain forest by plantation owners,
was fatally shot Thursday outside his home in Xapuri, 2,650 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   The issue of how to develop the Amazon jungle, an expanse of rain
forest about two-thirds the size of the continental United States,
has often erupted in violent conflicts between landowners, landless
peasants, politicians, clergymen and ecologists who defend the
peasants.
   In Brazil, about 4 percent of the population owns half of the
arable land.
   Cattle ranchers, eager to clear forest lands for grazing, often
order the killings of squatters and ecologists who oppose them.
   Some experts say uncontrolled burning of the Amazon is
aggravating the greenhouse effect _ atmospheric warming caused by
the buildup of carbon dioxide.
   Federal police were still looking for five other members of the
rancher's family in connection with Mendes' death, Eichenberg said.
   A third son, 21-year-old Darcy Pereira, turned himself in to
police Monday and claimed he hired someone to kill Mendes. Officials
said they did not believe the confession.
   ``Our impression is that Darcy's confession is a smoke screen,''
said Eichenberg. ``We won't stop our search until we get to his
boss.''
   On Wednesday, police began a 48-hour operation to confiscate
illegal weapons in the region in an effort to halt widespread
violence in the western Amazon.
   Two years ago, federal police carried out a similar campaign in
the Parrot's Beak region of Brazil, a rural area 1,800 miles north
of Rio torn by land disputes.
   They set up roadblocks, searched vehicles, raided ranches and
confiscated hundreds of unregistered arms, but the violence
continued unchecked.
   Violent conflicts over land have increased since President Jose
Sarney, the first civilian president since a 21-year military regime
ended in 1985, announced a sweeping agrarian reform program.
   Since 1985, about 250 deaths a year have resulted from land
conflicts. In 1971, just 20 people were killed in 109 battles,
according to government figures.

   Fast cash turned into fast food for a man

   Police Chief George Price said Roger Thomas Wilson put the
crumpled check in his mouth and swallowed it while he was being

   Wilson and Linda Brello-Wilson of Summerfield were arrested as
they left the store, about 25 miles from St. Louis, after trying to

   Divers on Thursday recovered 24 more
bodies from the sinking of a launch earlier this week, and more than
100 people remained missing, police said.
   Since Tuesday's accident, 29 bodies have been recovered.
   The launch was carrying more than 250 people _ double its
capacity _ when it sank in the Dhaleswari River about six miles
south of Dhaka.
   The United News of Bangladesh said the launch was still under 21
feet of water. The ship was yet to be pulled out due to delay in the
arrival of a salvage vessel.
   Rescue operations were suspended until Friday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is considering new
federal labeling and processing rules to ensure that certain kinds
of meat patties, including pre-cooked hamburgers, are safe to eat.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service, said there has been ``increasing evidence
over the past several years'' that disease organisms survive in
products that many consumers erroneously believe are fully cooked
when bought.
   The proposal would affect fully cooked, partially cooked and
``char-marked'' ground meat patties.
   Crawford said examples include such items as ``Char-Broiled Beef
Patties,'' and ``Pre-Browned Fresh Pork Sausage Patties.''
   ``As these types of covenenience products continue to become more
popular we must establish requirements to reduce the potential for
food-borne illnesses,'' he said.
   Recently, Crawford said, a strain of bacteria _ Escherichia coli
_ was linked to an outbreak of food poisoning which hospitalized six
Minnesota school children with severe diarrhea and cramps.
   Crawford said the Centers for Disease Control determined that
undercooked beef patties caused the illness, although the specific
strain of bacteria that infected the children has not been isolated
from the patties.
   The proposed rule would establish requirements for the storage of
raw ingredients, processing times and temperatures, handling to
prevent contamination after processing, and labels that include
cooking instruction for final preparation.
   For example, he said, the partially cooked ground meat patties
would bear the label statement, ``Partially Cooked: For Safety, Cook
Until Well Done (Internal Temperature of 160 F).''
   Public comments on the proposal can be sent by Jan. 27 to: Policy
Office, Linda Carey, Hearing Clerk, FSIS, USDA, Washington, D.C.
20250.

   Rescuers plucked four seamen from the stormy
Atlantic after their 250-foot cargo ship sank, but one died and
seven others were missing today, including a crewman who slipped
through his life jacket, authorities said.
   An aircraft flying over the area spotted one of the men on a life
raft, but rescuers found the raft empty when they reached it.
Rescuers later spotted another man in the water, but they were
unsure whether he was alive.
   The rescue effort was hampered by heavy rains, 40- to 45-mph
winds and 20- to 25-foot seas, the Coast Guard said.
   The 11-member crew abandoned the Lloyd Bermuda in two rafts after
the ship's load shifted during the storm Wednesday night, said Coast
Guard Lt. j.g. Jonathan Trumble. The ship sank about 160 miles south
of Nantucket and 200 miles east of New Jersey, Trumble said.
   The captain sent a distress signal at 7:10 p.m. and lost
communication about five minutes later, the Coast Guard said.
   A merchant vessel, the Eagle, which was nearest to the Lloyd
Bermuda when it went down, was guided to one of the rafts by a Coast
Guard plane, said Coast Guard Lt. Paul Wolf.
   Two Lloyd Bermuda crew members were pulled aboard the Eagle about
1:45 a.m. today, but a third was lost at sea during a rescue
attempt, he said.
   ``The Eagle recovered two and in the process of trying to get the
third guy on board, he slipped through the life jacket and back into
the water and they can't see him now,'' he said.
   The two men aboard the Eagle were conscious and alert, Wolf said.
They were treated for mild hypothermia but were otherwise unharmed.
Their identities were not released.
   About 4 a.m., Coast Guard frogmen jumped from a helicopter and
saved two men who were drifting without rafts in the water, Wolf
said.
   They were taken by helicopter to Falmouth Hospital, where nursing
supervisor Kathy Correia said one was dead on arrival at about 6:45
a.m., apparently of hypothermia. The other, identified as Dario
Macio-Lopez, 35, was in fair condition in the intensive care unit.
   An aircraft flying over the area spotted a man on a life raft
about 7:30 a.m., but rescuers later found the raft empty, Chief
Petty Officer Bill Ball. Rescuers saw another man in the water but
could not reach him because of rough seas.
   Two helicopters, a jet from the Coast Guard air station on Cape
Cod and a C-130 aircraft from Elizabeth City, N.C., began searching
for survivors late Wednesday. But the helicopters ran low on fuel
after about 90 minutes and returned to Cape Cod, Trumble said.
   Another C-130 was dispatched from Cape Cod shortly after the
first two crew members were rescued.
   The Lloyd Bermuda, registered in Cyprus, is a container ship that
makes a regular weekly run from Port Elizabeth, N.J., to Bermuda,
Arbogast said. It was believed to be carrying general cargo,
including food and building materials, and is one of the three main
supply vessels to the island nation off North Carolina.
   The ship's captain was American, while the crew was mostly from
Central America, said John W. Moore of the Meyer Agencies Ltd. in
Hamilton, Bermuda, the ship's agent.

   Military base spokesmen today reacted with a stiff upper lip to a
government commission's cost-cutting proposal to close 86 bases
nationwide, but civilians decried the effects the closings would
have on their economies.
   Politicians declared victory in areas where bases were spared by
the measure, which would save an estimated $5.6 billion over 20
years.
   ``We're not going to fight with anybody. It's not our decision.
Things are going to fall where they're going to fall,'' said Lt.
Col. Ron Yacovelli, a spokesman for Fort Sheridan outside Chicago.
   Fort Sheridan serves as headquarters for the 4th U.S. Army, which
includes reservists in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin,
Iowa and Minnesota. It employs about 1,500 civilians and 1,500
military personnel.
   ``The decision has been made and like any decision, we'll press
on and carry it out,'' said Maj. Dave Sutherlin, a spokesman for
Chanute Base, about 15 miles north of Champaign, Ill. ``I want to
stress that it's only a recommendation. ... We're not going to shut
our gates tomorrow.''
   The base employs about 7,000 people in Rantoul, a town of 20,000.
   Plans to shut down the Presidio in San Francisco, where the Sixth
Army is headquartered, was a surprise to Mayor Art Agnos' office.
   ``What we heard was that it will close partially,'' said mayoral
spokeswoman Eileen Maloney. She said the announcement will have to
be studied and run through ``a number cruncher'' before the mayor
would be ready to comment on what it means to the city in terms of
lost jobs and money.
   ``It will depend, I guess, on how many people will be gored by
this,'' she said. ``We're not pleased it's closing. (Agnos) has
already signed onto the Committee to Save the Presidio.''
   In addition to the complete closure of 86 bases, 59 others were
slated for partial closing or realignment.
   Among those was Fort Dix, New Jersey's largest military base. The
panel recommended that it be reduced to ``semi-active status'' for
an annual savings of $84.5 million. The base, now one of the Army's
eight basic-training posts, would lose that function entirely.
   The announcement was bad news for the Pemberton Township Board of
Education, whose schools are attended by children of Fort Dix's
military personnel.
   Mark Cowell, business administrator for the district, said
children of base personnel comprise 38 percent of its student body.
   ``We are in the middle of adding an addition to our high school
because they have been expanding the base,'' he said.
   A historic fort built to protect stagecoach travelers from Indian
attack also fell under the ax. Fort Douglas, built in 1862 in the
foothills of Utah's Wasatch Mountains, had long been criticized by
congressional foes as contributing little to national defense.
   ``I'm sure there's going to be people disappointed who work
here,'' said Army Maj. Bill Auer, the fort's spokesman. ``One of the
things we have to contend with is 44 of our buildings here are also
registered national historic landmarks.''
   Not all the news from the report was bad. Several communities
were elated by the panel's recommendation to expand several
facilities.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., welcomed the proposal to add 661
military and 126 civilian personnel at Fort Jackson, the Army base
in Columbia.
   ``Fort Jackson is one of our nation's finest and most vital
military training facilities and I am enthusiastic about the
increase of its role in providing for our nation's defense,'' he
said.
   Although the commission report spelled doom for the Philadelphia
Naval Hospital, which the Navy had long anticipated closing, the
announcement brought relief to supporters of the Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard.
   ``We won,'' said U.S. Rep. Thomas Foglietta, standing with
workers at the gate of the Navy base and shipyard, which employs
about 8,500 people.
   ``We are going to stay open,'' he said. ``I am happy. In fact I
am thrilled the Philadelphia Naval Base and Naval shipyard is not on
the list of defense facilities that are to be closed around the
country. The workers won. This is their victory.''
   Residents of Ayer, Mass., site of Fort Devens, New England's only
Army base, also rejoiced at being spared.
   ``It's the best news we could have for a New Year's,'' said Ed
Kelley, owner of a local card shop and a director of the town's
chamber of commerce. ``It's the life and blood of the town. It would
have been devastating if Fort Devens had been closed.''

<HEAD>Armenian Officials Cool to Sakharov Mediation in Ethnic Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Armenian official on Thursday dismissed the
mediation effort by human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov in the
bloody Caucasus ethnic dispute, saying authorities can settle the
matter on their own.
   ``I think we have sufficient help and advice from the government
and party on the Karabakh issue,'' said Vardges Artsruny, a deputy
premier of the Armenian republic, when asked if officials welcomed
Sakharov's mission.
   Sakharov, a 67-year-old physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner,
returned Monday from a trip to Armenia and the neighboring republic
with which it is feuding, Azerbaijan. Armenians familiar with the
mission said it was aimed at seeking a compromise in the
10-month-old rift over control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Armenians began strikes and demonstrations in February to press
their demand that the territory, part of Azerbaijan since 1923, be
incorporated into the Armenian republic. Azerbaijanis have refused
to cede the district, and Moscow authorities have sided with them.
Clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the dispute have
left at least 60 people dead.
   Bonner, who accompanied Sakharov on the trip with three other
people she declined to identify, said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and his closest ally, Alexander Yakovlev, a member of the ruling
Politburo, had approved the trip.
   She said the group visited the Armenian capital of Yerevan, the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku, and Stepanakert, the main city of
Nagorno-Karabakh, but declined to say whom they met or exactly what
they discussed.
   Asked whether the officials or Sakharov proposed the mission, and
how the leaders had expressed their backing, Bonner said: ``If he
wanted to publicize this, he would.''
   Artsruny, the deputy premier, was asked about the Sakharov
mission in a television hookup in which Moscow-based reporters put
questions to Armenian officials in Yerevan. He said Sakharov's help
was not needed and then lashed out at journalists who raised the
Nagorno-Karabakh issue while Armenia was suffering from the Dec. 7
earthquake.
   Another deputy premier, Yuri Hojamiryan, said he met with
Sakharov in Yerevan but that they only discussed earthquake relief
efforts, not the ethnic dispute.
   Also in the news conference, Armenia's Interior Minister, Usik
Arutunyan, said his forces had restored order to the republic and
that there had been ``no conflicts stemming from racism'' recently.
   Authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and sent tanks and
troops into many parts of Armenia and Azerbaijan late last month to
quell ethnic unrest. Several Armenian political activists have been
arrested.
   Gorbachev has said the ethnic dispute threatens his reform
program known as perestroika and has expressed anger at activists
who continually raise the issue.
   During a visit to the United States earlier this month, Sakharov
recommended the disputed territory be taken out of Azerbaijan's
hands and placed temporarily under a central administration.
Sakharov also called for United Nations observers to investigate the
ethnic unrest.
   Gorbachev's approval of the mission reflects Sakharov's improving
official standing.
   Sakharov won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his human rights
campaigning, but was exiled to the city of Gorky in 1980 for
criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. In December
1986, Gorbachev telephoned Sakharov and said he could return to
Moscow. He was restored to good graces at the Academy of Sciences
and has been quoted frequently in the press.

<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had her
first meeting with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India on Thursday
and urged her fellow south Asian leaders to spend less money on
weapons and more on fighting disease and poverty.
   Ms. Bhutto assumed the chairmanship of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation and opened the first session of
the seven-nation summit, then met with the leader of the nation that
has long been her country's bitter rival.
   Less than a month after Pakistan's first free elections in 11
years propelled her into the prime minister's job and made her the
first woman leader of a modern Moslem nation, Ms. Bhutto used the
summit to call for a reassessment of priorities in the impoverished
Asian subcontinent.
   ``Some of us are spending too great a proportion of our national
resources on defense, maintaining large military forces that face
each other,'' Ms. Bhutto said, speaking in English with an accent
that reflects both her Harvard and Oxford educations.
   Ms. Bhutto, whose country spends almost 40 percent of its budget
on defense, added: ``The truth is that our people face the same
common problems _ the problems of poverty, disease, slums, ignorance
and unemployment _ and it is to the vanquishing of these enemies
that we should direct all our efforts.''
   Gandhi, in his speech at the opening session in the auditorium of
the State Bank Building, also spoke of the need to translate the
group's scores of seminars and study groups into concrete action.
   ``In each of our countries, the highest priority is the war on
poverty,'' Gandhi said. ``Until we make (the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation) a people's movement, its achievements will
lie recorded only in dusty files or molder in the cabinets of our
bureaucracies.
   ``We have not taken even one full step down the road towards
regional cooperation of a kind which interfaces with our people on
development issues at the grassroots,'' ghe said.
   Ms. Bhutto urged fellow members ``to seek regional solutions for
curbing the arms race and the danger of nuclear proliferation of
war.''
   India's nuclear weapons program and Pakistan's ability to
manufacture nuclear arms have been a major obstacle to friendlier
relations between the two countries.
   Moslem Pakistan has fought three wars with predominantly Hindu
India since 1947, when the two nations were created through
partition along religious lines out of the British colonial India.
   Ms. Bhutto chatted occasionally with Gandhi while seated on the
platform at the 2{-hour opening session of the fourth annual summit.
She saw him privately afterward, and two more private sessions are
scheduled Friday and Saturday.
   Their meeting has eclipsed the presence of the five other
leaders: President Hussain Muhammad Ershad of Bangladesh, King Jigme
Singhe Wangchuk of Bhutan, President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the
Maldives, King Birendra of Nepal and President Junius R. Jayewardene
of Sri Lanka.
   But the summit, by providing a venue for Gandhi and Ms. Bhutto to
get to know each other, has prompted hopes that this new generation
of Indian and Pakistani leaders can transcend the bitter memories of
their nations' intertwined histories.
   Gandhi, 44, took office in 1984 after the assassination of his
mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Ms. Bhutto, 35, led her
Pakistan Peoples Party to an electoral triumph in last month's
Parliament elections. On Dec. 2, she was sworn in as prime minister,
a post held by her father, Prime Minister Zulkifar Ali Bhutto, who
was ousted in a military coup in 1977 and later executed.
   India, with 880 million people, and Pakistan, with 107 million,
are the mightiest military and political powers of the nations,
which have a combined population of 1.1 billion.

   A government commission today proposed closing,
partially closing or changing the missions of 145 military bases or
installations for savings of $693 million a year.
   The Commission on Base Realignment and Closure called for closing
86 installations, including 52 military housing units. Five more
installations would be partially closed and 54 others would get new
missions and additional personnel.
   If Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci accepts the commission's
recommendations, Congress will have to either accept them all or
reject them all. Under the procedure it enacted, Congress,
historically reluctant to close bases, cannot spare some of the
facilities while letting others close.
   Under a formula taking into account future inflationary costs and
other factors, the commission estimated savings would amount to $5.6
billion over a 20-year period. That would amount to a minuscule part
of defense costs; the Pentagon's budget runs now at about $300
billion a year.
   ``My initial impression is favorable. My general feeling is that
this will be well received by the Congress,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   He said the odds ``are heavily in favor'' of the recommendations
taking effect.
   ``The recommended changes reflect an opportunity to improve the
nation's defense position,'' said Abraham Ribicoff, a former
Democratic senator from Connecticut, who headed a commission which
presented the list of recommended changes at a Pentagon news
conference this morning.
   Co-chairman Jack Edwards, a former Republican congressman from
Alabama, said the panel used ``improvement in military value of our
domestic base structure as the pre-eminent consideration.''
   ``Our report presents an opportunity to reduce training costs in
terms of manpower, overhead costs and fuel, to improve command and
control, consolidate training and improve economies of scale and to
remove unnecessary administrative burdens to our defense managers,''
said Edwards.
   ``Despite these improvements, we do not anticipate any
substantial socio-economic disruption to the communities that are
closely linked to the bases that are recommended for closure,'' said
Edwards.
   The largest affected bases were five Air Force bases _ Chanute in
Illinois, George, Mather and Norton in California and Pease in New
Hampshire, all recommended for closing; plus three Army
installations _ Fort Dix, in New Jersey, to partially close, Fort
Sheridan, in Illinois, the Presidio in downtown San Francisco to
close and Fort Dix in New Jersey, to partially close _ and one naval
installation, the Philadelphia Naval Hospital, to close.
   Other important bases that would be affected are Fort Meade, Md.,
to partially close, and the Jefferson Proving Ground, in Indiana, to
close.
   A naval station at Hunters Point, San Francisco, would not be
built. Several facilities will gain personnel from the changes,
including the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, Fort Devens, Mass.,
and the Naval Station at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
   The news came as a blow to several communities, but others that
were spared exulted.
   ``We won,'' said Pennsylvania Rep. Thomas Foglietta, standing
with workers at the gate of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, which
employs about 8,500 people. ``We are going to stay open,'' he said.
   Implementation of the recommendations would follow a complex
procedure involving Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, both Houses
of Congress and George Bush after he becomes president on Jan. 20.
   The process, which requires that the whole package of proposals
be either accepted or rejected, is designed to withstand political
pressure from congressmen trying to protect bases in their districts.
   Former Missouri Sen. Tom Eagleton, a commission member,
complained that the armed services, especially the Navy, had impeded
the panel's work.
   ``The Air Force ultimately gave its cooperation,'' Eagleton said
in an ``additional view'' at the close of the 88-page final report.
   ``The Army begrudgingly gave its reluctant cooperation. The Navy
stonewalled, and got away with it,'' Eagleton's statement said.
   ``Intransigence paid off. When the new secretary of defense looks
to further base closings as a means of trimming the Pentagon budget,
he should most certainly start with the Navy. The Navy `refused to
play' this time: it should be obliged to next time,'' Eagleton said.
   As Ribicoff and Edwards presented the report to Deputy Defense
Secretary William H. Taft IV at the Pentagon, copies were delivered
simultaneously to the chairmen of the House and Senate Armed
Services committees: Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., and Nunn.
   Before the commission acted today, and aide to Aspin said his
office had been besieged with telephone calls from members of
Congress trying to learn whether their districts were affected.
   The Pentagon has closed no major installations since 1977, mainly
because of pressure from members of Congress with major bases in
their districts.
   Members of the commission visited about 40 bases during a
seven-month examination of the nation's 3,800 military
installations. The review generally centered on the 870 largest
bases, said Jim Abbee, a commission spokesman.
   The estimated annual savings of $693 million cited by Ribicoff
and Edwards fell far short of earlier Pentagon estimates, which
reached as high as $5 billion. Aspin had said that $2 billion a year
was ``a more realistic figure.''
   Edwards said his panel did not start out with specific targets,
either in number of bases to be closed or in dollars saved.
   Release of the panel's report was the biggest step yet in the
process set up by Congress to close unneeded bases and remove
congressmen from the political heat that follows the lost jobs.
   The Edwards panel was approved in the waning days of the 100th
Congress as a political compromise by legislators who wanted to
reduce the federal budget deficit and also avoid constituent
criticism.
   Carlucci will have until Jan. 15 _ five days before he leaves
office _ to accept or reject the panel's findings. He will not have
the option of picking or choosing among the bases.
   Approval of the package by Carlucci would send the issue back to
the House and Senate, which may block the closings if both pass
resolutions against them.
   George Bush, after he becomes president, would have the right to
veto that resolution, and his veto could be overridden by a
two-thirds majority of both houses.

<HEAD>California Court Restricts Suits by Fired Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court today
restricted the right of fired workers to sue their employers on the
grounds that a dismissal broke a promise of continued employment.
   In a victory for employers, the court ruled 4-3 that a worker who
is fired without good cause, in violation of a company's express or
implied promise, can sue only for reinstatement and back pay, and
not for emotional distress and punitive damage awards that often are
much larger.
   Citing the need for ``commercial stability,'' Chief Justice
Malcolm Lucas wrote that it was ``important that employers not be
unduly deprived of discretion to dismiss an employee by the fear
that doing so will give rise to potential tort recovery (for
additional damages) in every case.''
   The court allowed employees to seek the additional damages when
their firings involved violations of public policy, such as a
worker's refusal to violate a law. But Lucas placed new limits on
such lawsuits, saying the policy involved must serve the public and
not merely the employer's interests.
   One pro-employee aspect of the ruling was the court's willingness
to allow lawsuits to proceed based on an oral promise of continued
employment.
   Justice Allen Broussard, who wrote one of three separate
dissenting opinions, accused the majority of ``a radical attempt to
rewrite California law in a manner which ... will leave the
wrongfully discharged worker without an adequate remedy.''
   The ruling reinstates but sharply limits a lawsuit by Daniel
Foley, who was fired from his $56,164-a-year job as Los Angeles
branch manager of Interactive Data Corp. in 1983, after telling the
company that his boss was being investigated by the FBI for
embezzlement from a former employer.
   The boss later pleaded guilty to embezzlement. Foley, who had a
spotless record in nearly seven years of employment, refused a
transfer to another office and was fired two days after he got a
merit bonus of $6,762.
   His lawsuit, still in the pretrial stages, contends the firing
violated a company promise of continued employment and was a pretext
for covering up wrongdoing, in violation of public policy. Today's
ruling allowed Foley to proceed with his lawsuit but limited his
potential damages to lost salary payments.

   Q. Congressman (Les) Aspin (D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee) suggested that there was a loophole in this
whole procedure and that funds had to be appropriated annually to
close these bases and, by use of that loophole, bases could be
prevented from being closed. Did you address that question and what
did you do about it?
   EDWARDS: There is a problem, because the proceeds of the sales of
these facilities will go into the fund to carry out the purposes of
this law. And those proceeds are not going to start coming in on Day
One. It's going to take a while to come in. And so we have
recommended in this report that Congress in (fiscal 1990)
appropriate $300 million to put the first money in the fund so we
can start the process. And obviously, if Congress refuses to
appropriate enough money to get ... the process going, then it's
going to be very difficult.
   Q. It's often said that certain bases have remained open over the
years for political or pork barrel reasons. Did you find any
evidence of that in your study? And how far have you gone to
eliminating it, if that's the case?
   RIBICOFF: I don't think there was any influence or any attempt to
protect pork barrel bases. I don't think that was taken into account
at all. I don't think anybody on the commission felt any pressure.
We looked at these bases seriously. We looked at all the figures. We
spent a lot of time in discussion. Each and every base was voted on
unanimously, with the action taken.
   EDWARDS: You should understand first that we simply did not start
with a list. ... We started with a set of criteria which we applied
to all 4,300 installations in this country. ... And we took those as
we found them.
   Q. There are four states that are missing _ West Virginia,
Mississippi, Georgia and Wisconsin, all home states of the chairmen
of the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. Were there no
bases in those states worthy of closing?
   EDWARDS: That's certainly not by design. We did take a little
something out of Fort McPherson in Georgia, I recall. I don't
believe we touched Wisconsin. West Virginia, I'm going to bet,
doesn't have a whole lot of military in the first place. ... We had
to deal with bases where we found them.
   Q. Could you please elaborate on some of the personnel changes
that are going to take place at Fort Devens and some of the other
bases that are getting increases of people?
   RIBICOFF: We found that certain missions were split between a
number of bases _ they didn't make any sense _ when they should have
been consolidated and put in one base. And what we did in many
instances, we just do that, and especially when you talk about Fort
Devens. ... You will find a shift from one fort to the other, one
base to the other, which will make it more effective, more
efficient, and be able to do a much better job with their mission.
   Q. I wonder if you had the opportunity to pass judgment on the
value of strategic home porting, to see whether dispersion of ships
offers protection in the nuclear age, or whether it's really just a
way of building local political support for various naval tasks.
   EDWARDS: I don't know anything that was discussed more than
strategic home porting. ... We concluded that our job was not to
deal with force structure. That's the military's job. ... Our job
was to try to deal with that force structure as we found it, and try
to accommodate it to the facilities that we were working with. And
so we had to live with the fact that there's going to be a 600-ship
Navy. Maybe there never will be... but we don't know that.
   So we had to look at the home ports with an idea where are you
going to put that other 150 ships that are building up from the
450-ship Navy. And we concluded that we could justify some home
ports, most of them.
   Q. If it were not for political constraints, could you actually
... expand your list? Are there a lot of other bases you consider
still vulnerable or could be effectively closed?
   EDWARDS: The biggest constraint ... is the six-year payback
constraint. We found a lot of facilities that had 10-year paybacks,
12-year paybacks, even 20-year paybacks, where we could have made
some major savings over a longer period of time. But we were
constrained by our charter, which had a six-year payback.
   RIBICOFF: Once you got over the six years, we had to stop. I
think wisdom and better planning would have been more meaningful if
we weren't stuck with that six-year payback.
   Q. In other words, some of these places survived because of
   their inefficiency?
   EDWARDS: No, I think it may cost a lot of money to move one
facility into another base and have to build all-new construction,
and your payback just simply won't make it.

<HEAD>State Department Assumes Pan Am Bombing Was Terrorist Act</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: TOP 7 grafs new; picks up 2nd graf, Government officials.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said today investigators
were working on the assumption the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 was
an act of terrorism rather than a nonpolitical crime.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley also said officials believe the case
can be solved. ``We think that the chances are pretty good,'' she
said. ``We can't be sure.''
   As the probe of the Dec. 21 disaster moved into its second week,
U.S. investigators were still unable to pinpoint guilt. Mrs. Oakley
said they had no hard leads, no specifically incriminating evidence.
   But asked if the boming of the plane was an act of terrorism, in
contrast to a simple criminal act, she said ``clearly most of us
feel that it is more likely, but we are not sure.''
   The U.S. official added: ``We really have to pursue all the
avenues of the investigation to say with certainty that it was a
terrorist activity.''
   Mrs. Oakley said no new information had been received since
Wednesday when she declined to say whether a terrorist was behind
the bombing. ``We are all operating in that sense on the basis of
assumptions of what seems likely,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration, mystified how the
bomb got aboard, began searching for possible security lapses by
American airlines abroad and directed tighter screening of
passengers and their baggage.
   Government officials acknowledged Wednesday that a week after the
Pan American World Airways jumbo jet exploded over Scotland, killing
at least 270 people, there are no hard leads on who put the
explosive device on the jet or where the deed was done.
   Shortly after it was confirmed Wednesday by British investigators
that a bomb caused the Boeing 747 to crash Dec. 21 on a flight to
New York from London, the Reagan administration promised ``all
available assistance'' in investigating the bombing.
   U.S. officials said there was a wide range of terrorist groups
that may have been responsible. But Paul Bremer, the State
Department's chief of counterterrorism, told reporters it was too
early to focus suspicion on a particular group.
   ``We shouldn't narrow our field of inquiry until we get more
evidence or intelligence that leads us in a certain direction. ...
There isn't any prime suspect,'' he said.
   Bremer said today on ``CBS This Morning'' that ``we have a very
good chance'' of finding out who was responsible for the bombing but
that ``we're a long way from those conclusions at this point.'' He
said officials don't yet know if it was a terrorist attack.
   The FAA, meanwhile, said it was ``reviewing current security
measures'' being taken by U.S. air carriers abroad because of the
bombing and said it was preparing ``more stringent security
requirements which will afford additional protection to U.S. air
carriers and the traveling public.''
   The FAA in a statement did not cite specific changes that are
being directed at the airlines. Agency spokesman Fred Farrar said
FAA security experts are still working out details of the new
requirements, some of which are likely not to be made public.
   Much of the focus is expected to be on tightening passengers
screening, inspection of carry-on luggage and taking additional
precautions to match all baggage with boarding passengers.
   ``In some cases it will be a matter of degree,'' Farrar said.
   The FAA is responsible for establishing security requirements for
U.S. airlines both in the United States and abroad, although many
security measures are imposed in cooperation with the other
governments involved.
   While little evidence so far has been uncovered to indicate who
might be responsible for the Pan Am bombing, U.S. officials said
there are a number of potential suspects. They include radical
Palestinians such as the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine _ General Command, and the pro-Libyan Abu Nidal group,
as well as an Iranian group, the Guardians of Islamic Revolution.
   Bremer said among the tasks confronting investigators was to find
out how the bomb got aboard Flight 103, where it was placed and what
it was made of. It's not known whether the bomb eluded security at
Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated as a Boeing
727, or at London's Heathrow Airport, where the flight shifted to a
Boeing 747 for the trip to New York.
   Senior FAA officials have acknowledged that they are perplexed by
the bombing because both the Frankfurt and London airports are
considered to be particularly security conscious and Pan Am had
undertaken special security precautions because of a tip the airline
might be a target of a terrorist bombing.
   According to FAA Administrator Allan McArtor these precautions by
Pan Am included having all checked bags go through X-ray, having all
carry-on bags checked by hand, matching all checked luggage with
boarding passengers and imposing special surveillance of caterers
and others who might have access to the jetliner.
   The White House pledged ``all available resources'' to help the
British investigation, including assistance from the FBI. FBI
Director William B. Sessions said that includes interviewing
relatives and associates of passengers aboard the Pan Am jet to
determine if a bomb might have been placed aboard the plane to
target a specific passenger.
   Last week, the U.S. government offered a reward of up to $500,000
for information leading to the prosecution of any terrorist or
saboteur who caused the crash.
   ``The incident points up the need for the international community
to adopt even more stringent air security measures,'' State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   She said the United States had agreed with Finnish police in
ruling out any connection between the crash and a Dec. 5 telephone
call to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki from a person who said a Pan Am
jet would be the target of a bombing in December. That call had
prompted an alert from the FAA and caused Pan Am to increase
security at Frankfurt and London, officials have said.

   Two Israeli helicopter gunships attacked
with rockets and destroyed a base of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal
in southern Lebanon today. Police said eight people were wounded.
   On Wednesday, Israeli soldiers shot and killed three suspected
infiltrators who crossed the border from Egypt, and mounted searches
in the Negev Desert for a fourth man who escaped, a military
spokesman in Israel said today.
   The Israeli army said today's raid was conducted to eliminate an
Amal base used by Palestinian guerrillas who raided northern Isreal
on Wednesday.
   Lebanese police said the Israeli Cobra gunships struck at 8 a.m.,
today hitting a four-story hilltop building used as an Amal command
post in Bir el-Salassel near the village of Tibnin, 9{ miles north
of the Israeli border.
   ``The building took several direct rocket hits and was leveled,''
said a police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations. The Israelis said the helicopters had returned safely.
   Tibnin is north of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone and is
the headquarters of the Irish battalion serving with the United
Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon.
   The air raid was Israel's first on an Amal base since 1985, when
the Israeli army pulled back and established the 8-to-10-mile-wide
security zone three years after invading Lebanon.
   An Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem said three Palestinian
guerrillas had used the Amal base for an attempt to infiltrate
Israel Wednesday. They were killed by Israeli troops at the border.
   The guerrillas belonged to the Palestine Liberation Front, a
small leftist faction supported by Syria, which also backs Amal.
   Amal members from the base assisted the Palestinian guerrillas in
their attempt to sneak into Israel and attack an Israeli settlement
on Wednesday, the Israeli army said.
   In the clash near the Egyptian border on Wednesday, it was not
immediately clear if the infiltration involved guerrillas or,
possibly, smugglers.
   The Israeli army said no identification papers or weapons were
found on the three bodies. One military official said, however, that
the possibility they were terrorists ``has not been ruled out.''
   The last major infiltration from Egypt was in March, when three
Palestinian guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three Israeli
civilians before they were shot to death. The PLO's Force 17 claimed
responsibility.
   Soldiers first detected the infiltration Wednesday when they
found footprints leading across Israel's southern border with Egypt,
said a military spokesman, who cannot be identified by name under
army rules.
   In another development, The Washington Post, quoting Israeli
sources, said a group of armed Palestinians was trapped Wednesday
night near the Jordanian border settlement of Ein Yahav. Unconfirmed
reports said three members of the group were killed. However, an
Israeli army spokesman, asked if there were two infiltrations, said:
``We have only the one we announced from Egypt.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Wednesday that Palestinian
guerrillas are stepping up attacks against Israel partly because of
the U.S. decision to talk to the PLO.
   Shamir and other Israeli leaders in their recent statements have
not mentioned the deep divisions within the PLO, apparently in part
because terror attacks pinned on the group help discredit the
diplomatic initiative of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Arafat, who heads the PLO's mainstream Fatah faction, said
earlier this month that he recognized Israel and renounced terror,
and in return the United States dropped its refusal to talk to the
PLO.

   A woman was shot to death by her estranged
husband Thursday as she ran from him with her 2-year-old daughter in
her arms, police said. The man then killed himself in Long Island's
second murder-suicide this week.
   In both cases, the woman was killed despite a court order of
protection.
   In Thursday's shooting, Elizabeth Croff, 30, of Central Islip,
had dropped her mother off at work and started to drive away when
her husband, William Croff, pulled up behind and rammed her car,
said Suffolk County police Officer Mark Ryan.
   Croff then jumped out with a shotgun and began firing at his
wife, who fled down the street carrying their daughter, Bernadette.
The volley hit the woman in the head, killing her, and struck the
child in the hip, police said.
   Croff returned to his car and shot himself in the head, Ryan said.
   The toddler, who also suffered cuts, probably when the mother
fell, was in stable condition at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore,
authorities said. No vital organs were damaged, said hospital
spokesman Clifford Steward.
   Police said Mrs. Croff had obtained a protection order against
her husband, but they had no information on when it was issued or
why.
   On Monday, Joseph Grohoski, 34, kicked in the door to his
estranged wife's home in Cutchogue, police said. Grohoski chased his
wife, Lydia, to the basement, where he killed her with a shotgun
blast to the head.
   He then killed himself while their 2-year-old son sat in the
kitchen.
   Police said Mrs. Grohoski obtained a protection order after he
threatened her Dec. 2.

   Domino's Pizza owner Tom Monaghan
wants to help the 500 residents of this bucolic island make some
dough, and he's not just talking pizza.
   Monaghan, who owns a vacation home and corporate retreat on the
island, plans to create a bank to serve residents, a spokesman said.
The island has a credit union but no commercial bank, aide Dick
Brunvand said Wednesday.
   The entrepreneur will apply next month with the state and hopes
to open the bank by mid-1989, Brunvand said. Monaghan, who also owns
the Detroit Tigers baseball team, expects to be chairman of the bank.
   Monaghan owns 1,700 acres on the island off the eastern tip of
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The land is mainly used as a vacation
spot for Domino's employees and includes a golf course and compound
for three orphaned bear cubs.
   The pizza magnate is dredging the harbor to make room for his
sailing ship, the Domino Effect.

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson's former trainer
was arrested after hitting another car and scuffling with two police
officers, police said.
   Kevin Rooney was charged with drunken driving, leaving the scene
of an accident and resisting arrest following the fender-bender
Wednesday night, said Sgt. Peter Sweeney, a police spokesman. No one
was injured in the accident.
   Rooney kept going after hitting the other car, but the driver

   Tim Matheson, one of the actors who starred in
the hit movie ``Animal House,'' is among a group of investors that
served notice it may seek control of struggling National Lampoon
Inc., which made the film.
   Matheson, who played Otter in the 1978 movie, is part of
Grodnik@Matheson Co., a Los Angeles-based independent production
company said to represent about one-fifth of the shares of publicly
traded National Lampoon.
   The group may seek to take over the New York-based magazine and
film company, according to documents filed this week with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   National Lampoon Chairman Matty Simmons said Matheson and two
other individuals of the group have told him they may not pursue a
takeover if they are given representation on the board.
   Simmons said National Lampoon is recovering from a four-year
slump that he blamed in part on opposition from fundamentalist
religious groups and the Justice Department's Commission on
Pornography.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer, well known for
his good works, wants a pardon for a black mark on his record:
conviction on three charges of making secret contributions to a
presidential campaign.
   Hammer pleaded guilty in 1976 to the misdemeanors during
President Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign. He was fined $3,000 and
placed on a year's probation.
   He has spent several years seeking a pardon and has approached
President Reagan about it, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
   The 90-year-old head of Occidental Petroleum Inc. has donated
millions of dollars to cancer research and other charities and has
used his contacts with the Soviet Union to promote world peace.

   The State Department criticized the Supreme
Court of El Salvador on Thursday for deciding against the
extradition of a former air force captain who was arrested last year
in Miami in the investigation of the 1980 assassination of
Archbishop Oscar Romero.
   The Salvadoran government withdrew its request for the
extradition of Alvaro Saravia after the Central American country's
court ruled last week there were no grounds for arresting him on
charges he had violated his visa and that the extradition request
itself was illegal.
   Romero, an outspoken critic of rightist death squads, was killed
March 24, 1980, while saying Mass. In November 1987, President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, who is opposed by rightist political forces in El
Salvador, released testimony by the driver of the getaway car that
he worked for Saravia.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the United
States was concerned whether Salvadoran judicial authorities were
vigorously pursuing human rights cases regardless of the political
persuasion of violators.
   ``We are still seeking a full explanation of the implications of
this decision by the Salvadoran court,'' she said. ``Our embassy
will indicate our strong disatisfaction with the decision to the
Salvadoran government.''
   The Salvadoran government said Wednesday the case would remain
unresolved because of the ruling.

   Chinese officials said Thursday they
probably would punish at least seven African students for a brawl
with Chinese workers, students and teachers that set off days of
anti-black demonstrations.
   They said no Chinese students would be punished for participating
in the clash and subsequent demonstrations, or for sacking the rooms
of some African students.
   ``We know who the Africans are that carried out the beating,''
said Yang Ruiju, president of Hehai University where the clash took
place. ``The African students did this in a planned way.''
   But the Chinese students ``demonstrated out of anger. They didn't
hurt anybody so none of them will be punished,'' Yang said in an
interview.
   About 140 African students, joined by about a dozen other foreign
students, remained in isolation at a guest house about a 90-minute
drive outside of this eastern China city. Yang said the seven
``suspects'' were at the guest house.
   The students have been at the house since Monday night, when
Chinese police forced them there from the Nanking train station. The
students wanted to travel to Beijing because they fear for their
safety.
   Officials said Thursday that all the students except the seven or
eight Africans involved in the fracas could leave the guest house as
long as they returned to their schools in Nanking.
   Two Western reporters who went to the guest house Thursday were
refused permission to speak with the students. Chinese officials at
the Jiangsu provincial foreign affairs office also refused to let
reporters talk with the students.
   Young Chinese took to the streets for the fifth straight day
since Saturday, when 11 Chinese and two Africans were injured in the
Hehai clash.
   A crowd of about 800, well below the figure on previous nights,
gathered at Gulou, an old drum tower on a main Nanking intersection.
Some 600 later marched peacefully from there to the city center,
escorted by hundreds of police.
   The students again called on the government to deal with the
Hehai clash ``according to law.''
   Earlier demonstrations on Sunday and Monday were markedly racist
in tone, with youths chanting ``Down with black devils!'' and
``Black devils go home!''
   Some Chinese students also protested preferential conditions
given to foreign students.
   On Wednesday night, riot police wielding clubs charged a crowd of
thousands. Officers hit youths and drove some off in unmarked vans.
   Thursday's Xinhua Daily, the city's main paper, called for peace
in the streets. The front-page editorial also called for Chinese to
be friendly to foreigners.
   In the interview, Yang claimed the African students at Hehai
planned the bloodshed.
   He said the Africans started the fight because they were unhappy
about a wall that was being built around their two dormitories at
the university. If the wall was erected, he said, the Africans
``couldn't play with girls freely.''
   He also accused the African students of consorting with
prostitutes.
   African students, mostly men who spend up to six years in China,
say their social contacts with Chinese women frequently are the
catalyst for racial confrontations. Although China has close
relations with most black African states, deep-seated prejudices
against blacks are common among Chinese, they say.
   Huang Jie, division chief of the Jiangsu provincial foreign
affairs office in Nanking, said no arrests have been made so far.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing stressed at a weekly news
briefing that ``the incident that has occurred in Nanking is an
isolated one having nothing to do with racial discrimination.''
   He said charges the Africans are being illegally held were
``groundless.''
   On Thursday, the only African student to leave the guest house
and return to Nanking said he was afraid for his life and wanted to
leave China as soon as possible.
   ``I am very fearful,'' said a 23-year-old from the Comoro Islands
in the Indian Ocean.
   ``I won't leave this building. Even seeing a Chinese outside the
window makes me cold with fright,'' said the student, who identified
himself only as Bourhane and spoke in an interview at Nanking
Polytechnical Institute.
   At the guest house, located at a chemical fiber factory northwest
of the city, Chinese officials refused to let two Western reporters
talk with the students.

<HEAD>Government Reportedly Gives in to Strikes, Rolls Back Prices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government rolled back huge price
increases Thursday after a general strike cut off communications,
shut down a main airport and seaport and virtually paralyzed major
cities, reports said.
   Police fired on anti-government demonstrators in Khartoum who
continued to press for greater reforms after hearing that the
government had agreed to cut prices, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
   In Baghdad, the official Iraq News Agency transmitted a report
from Khartoum that said ``intensified'' shooting flared up shortly
after dark, ``especially near the headquarters of the council of
ministers.''
   There was no word on casualties in either incident, the first
reported violence in three days of protests in this financially
strapped northeast African country.
   The demonstrators who were fired on reportedly were demanding
that in addition to the economic concessions, the government work
toward cementing a tentative plan to end a 5{-year civil war in
southern Sudan.
   The peace pact was negotiated by John Garang, leader of the rebel
forces, and the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.
   The party, junior partner in the ruling coalition, dominates the
2 million-member Sudan Workers' Trade Union Federation, which
organized Thursday's general strike. The party announced on
Wednesday it was resigning from the government in sympathy with the
strikers.
   The reported price rollback was decided in an emergency cabinet
session chaired by Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi. It canceled increases
imposed Monday of 600 percent for sugar and 50 percent for
cigarettes and a 15 percent sales tax for all commodities.
   A statement reported by the Middle East News Agency reaffirmed
salary increases of up to 500 percent that the government had
decreed on Saturday. It also said people immediately could buy sugar
at old prices and that subsidies would be applied to sorghum,
Sudan's staple food.
   The government's had said he it needed the price increases to
finance the salary increases and subsidy program.
   The Egyptian agency also quoted Abdullah Mohammed Ahmed, the
information minister, as saying work would begin ``in the coming
hours'' on forming a new government in light of the Democratic
Unionists' pullout.
   The Sudan News Agency quoted Information Minister Abdullah
Mohammed Ahmed, the government's chief spokesman, as promising
immediate steps to form a new Cabinet.
   Ahmed presumably meant Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi would keep his
post, since his Umma Party has the largest number of parliamentary
seats.
   Meanwhile, Sudanese newspapers and the Sudan News Agency reported
many of the country's major cities were at a standstill Thursday.
   Communications were cut at midmorning, the time designated for
the strike, apparently the result of telecommunications workers
walking off their jobs.
   Coupled with the shutdown of Khartoum International Airport and
Port Sudan, the country's main Red Sea port, Sudan was virtually
isolated. Aircraft that normally fly over Sudan were being rerouted
because of the lack of radio contact with Khartoum air traffic
controllers.
   The trouble is similar to widespread unrest over high prices that
brought down former dictator Gaafar Nimeiri in 1985 after 16 years
in power. Then, however, powerful professional associations of
doctors and lawyers were in the forefront rather than workers and
students leading the current protests.

   A man who refused to force his son to cut his hair
to bring the teen-ager into compliance with a high school's grooming
code has been convicted of violating the state's compulsory school
attendance law.
   Jurors deliberated about 45 minutes Wednesday before convicting
Dub Wilkinson of the misdemeanor and fining him $25, the maximum.
   With court costs, Wilkinson, 48, will have to pay $100.
   Wilkinson, who said he will appeal, was found guilty of not
requiring his 14-year-old son Travis to attend Northbrook Senior
High School.
   Travis and his brother Brian, 16, have not attended class since
Oct. 28, when they were barred for failing to adhere to the school
district's dress code, which prohibits boys from having hair that
falls below their shoulders.
   Wilkinson had said it was his sons' right to wear their hair the
way they wanted. His position remained unchanged after the verdict.
   ``I will not ask my sons to cut their hair. That is their
decision,'' he said.
   ``My dad wouldn't keep me from school,'' Travis said Wednesday.
``I love him.''
   Texas' compulsory attendance law only applies through the
academic year a student turns 16, so Brian's non-attendance was not
part of the charges against his father.
   During the two-day trial, Wilkinson's attorney, Darrell
McAlexander, argued that the hair-length rule is enforced
selectively. He also questioned its purpose and said it held the
potential for sexual discrimination.
   Assistant District Attorney David Furlow said the verdict is a
reminder to students that the school ``is not a Burger King _ Travis
can't go there and demand he have it his own way.''
   District Superintendent Hal Guthrie and Principal James King said
the boys still must cut their hair before they are admitted to class.

   When it comes to pronouncing the name of
this tiny community, the official ruling is hold the ``MAY-o.''
   The Town Board of Carmel _ which includes the hamlet of Mahopac _
has ruled that the proper pronunciation is Mah-HO-pak, rather than
MAY-o-pak.
   The vote Tuesday night was 3-2, reflecting the division on the
long-debated issue in this community about 35 miles north of New
York City.
   Carmel Supervisor Richard Othmer said that in his experience _
which includes going door-to-door in the past 10 elections _ half
the residents call the community Mah-HO-pak and half said MAY-o-pak.
   Surveys conducted in 1986 came to opposite conclusions _ one
found 74 percent saying MAY-o-pac, and another found Mah-HO-pac
preferred 113 to 23.
   The name is believed to stem from an American Indian word, but
its original pronunciation is lost in history.
   Dorothy Jewell of the Carmel Historical Society presented each
board member at the meeting with a copy of the March 13, 1929, issue
of the old Lake Mahopac weekly, which bears the headline
``Mah-HO-pak is the Right Pronunciation.''
   Thomas Carey, a lifelong Mahopac resident who is the town
comptroller, seconded that pronunciation. He pointed out that the
Mahopac high school song includes the phrase ``High above the
Mah-HO-pak's waters.''
   ``It's the out-of-towners _ those city folk _ who moved in over
the years and changed the name of the community,'' he said.

   As part of its centennial celebration,
the Tournament of Roses Parade will feature a first Monday, a
wedding aboard one of the flower-studded floats.
   Carie Humphries, 21, and Ron Simms, 23, will exchange vows aboard
the Romance in California float before the millions who watch the
televised New Year's Day spectacle.
   Humphries, a student at California State University Long Beach,
and Simms, a student at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic in
Whittier, were chosen among entrants in the Search for the Most
Romantic Couple in Southern California contest.
   Officials estimate that the 60 floats, 22 musical units and more
than 250 equestrians will be viewed by 300 million people worldwide,
about 1 million of them at the parade site.
   The grand marshal for the 100th Tournament of Roses parade is
Shirley Temple Black. Mrs. Black, 60, also was grand marshal in
1939, when she was the child star of such classics as ``Heidi'' and
``Curly Top.''
   ``I can't imagine a more appropriate person to symbolize the

said John H. Biggar III, president of the Tournament of Roses

   The government has filed a lawsuit seeking to void
the 1987 re-election of Teamsters secretary-treasurer Weldon L.
Mathis as president of his Atlanta local, saying the voting may have
been rigged.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court Wednesday by the U.S. Justice
Department, seeks to invalidate Mathis' re-election as president of
Local 728 and the election of his son, W. Lamar Mathis Jr., and
other local officers.
   It also asks that a new election be conducted under federal
supervision.
   The elder Mathis, general secretary-treasurer of the
1.3-million-member Teamsters union, lost his bid to succeed Jackie
Presser as Teamsters president in July. The lawsuit would not affect
his position in the international.
   He resigned as Local 728 president in June after 21 years on the
job and created Local 928. He then transferred more than half of
Local 728's 8,000 members to the new local and appointed his son to
head it.
   Another son and a nice also joined Local 728, the son as business
agent.
   Two groups of candidates who ran against the Mathis slate in 1987
filed petitions with the Labor Department this year challenging the
election.
   They also accused the elder Mathis of forming the new local to
protect his relatives' jobs if he lost his re-election bid.
   If a federal judge grants the government's request, Local 728
officers appointed by the elder Mathis must stand for re-election.
   ``It's long overdue that we get a fair election,'' said Donald S.
Scott, who ran against Mathis in the disputed election. He said he
would run again.
   Weldon Mathis and Lamar Mathis were on vacation and unavailable
for comment, their secretaries said.

<TEXT>
   The decision to close Fort Douglas, a
119-acre Army installation built in 1862 to protect stagecoach
routes from Indians and keep an eye on Mormon settlers, came as
little surprise Thursday.
   The once-strategic post in the Wasatch Mountain foothills east of
downtown Salt Lake City had long been criticized in Congress as
contributing little to national defense.
   The government commission that put the fort on a list of
installations to be shut down or scaled back estimated that closing
Fort Douglas _ a collection of parade grounds, barracks and other
brick and whitewashed buildings, some dating from the 1920s and
1930s _ would save $1.4 million over 20 years.
   Members of the Utah congressional delegation expressed
conditional support for the decision. The commission called for the
reassignment of most of the fort's 640 full-time employees to other
Utah military installations.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, a Democrat whose district the fort is in,
``won't stand in the way if the decision was arrived at fairly, and
if indeed it will save more money than it costs to implement,'' said
Owens' spokesman Art Kingdom.
   Kingdom said Owens would introduce legislation to turn over the
property to the University of Utah. Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Utah, also
said he would propose such a bill.
   ``I'm sure there's going to be people disappointed who work
here,'' said Maj. Bill Auer, fort spokesman. ``One of the things we
have to contend with is 44 of our buildings here are also registered
national historic landmarks.
   ``Some of these buildings are quarters that military personnel
live in,'' he added. ``Personally, at this point, we're kind of
curious as to what and how they're going to do this.''
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said he would support the fort's closing
if convinced it is a cost-effective move for the Army. He said he
understood the installation's historic sites and buildings will be
preserved.
   ``I am pleased that the proposed impact on Utah is minimal,
because it is a clear affirmation of the efficiency and value of
Utah's military installations and personnel and the contribution
they make to our national security,'' Garn said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he understood only 77 civilian
jobs will be lost as a result.
   While Salt Lake City has no plans for the land and buildings,
Mayor Palmer DePauli believes it would ``be perfect for an Olympic
village'' if the city succeeds in its bid for the 1998 Winter
Olympics, said chief of staff Mike Zuhl.
   While officially built as an Indian post, the fort's first
commander, Col. Patrick Conner, acknowledged that he chose the
foothills overlooking Salt Lake City so he could keep an eye on
Brigham Young's polygamy-practicing Mormon pioneers.
   Connor referred to the settlers, who had arrived in the Salt Lake
Valley in 1847, as ``a community of traitors, murderers, fanatics
and whores'' who also were too friendly with the Indians.
   Tensions ran so high that when troops fired the fort's cannon to
salute Connor's promotion to general in 1863, the Mormons assumed it
was an attack. A thousand or more Mormon ``minutemen'' quickly
assembled to protect the city, but hostilities were avoided.
   Relations between the government and Mormons were strained when
Conner tried to force merchants to take an oath of loyalty to the
United States as a condition of selling goods at the fort. The
crisis abated after Conner's departure.
   The church dropped polygamy in 1890, and Utah became a state in
1896. From that point, the Army and city got along well.
   In modern times the fort's personnel have been assigned a variety
of missions. The base gives logistic and administrative support
primarily to reserve units, but also active units, in Utah, Idaho
and Wyoming.
   It also is headquarters for Pentagon recruiting efforts in the
region and is the reserve pay office for 14 states. More than 2,300
reservists with the Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard train at the
fort each year.

   The government has refused to grant automatic
resident status to 85,000 people living in Canada who claim to be
refugees, immigration officials said.
   The government instead will begin screening each case after Jan.
1, with some deportations virtually assured, said Immigration
Minister Barbara McDougall,
   ``I want to state categorically that removals will take place,''
she said. ``Many people came here making refugee claims to
circumvent our immigration laws. ... We must restore integrity to
our refugee and immigration system.''
   She declined at a news conference on Wednesday to estimate how
many of the 85,000 claims pending will be accepted under a two-year
screening program expected to cost $83 million.
   The announcement of the screening program drew criticism from
some quarters.
   ``No one wants to reward refugee scam artists or the blatant
queue-jumpers who take the place of legitimate applicants,'' the
Toronto Star said in an editorial. ``But to show little compassion
for those thousands who have been here for months seems hard-hearted
at the very least.''
   The Star, which frequently criticizes Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government, asked if this could
be the same Canada that ``demonstrated its compassion to the world''
in 1979 by accepting more than 75,000 Vietnamese boat people.
   But the tabloid Toronto Sun praised the decision. ``Deporting the
phony refugees is the only fair way to handle those who try to jump
the queue ahead of those who have been waiting for years, some of
them to be reunited with their families.''
   Officials said humanitarian or compassionate grounds will be
considered before any deportation.
   Although activists believe the program could threaten people
genuinely seeking refuge in Canada, others say many of the
immigrants are seeking economic improvements and not political
safety.
   The program will send each of the 85,000 people claiming refugee
status before government panels, each with two members. A decision
by any one member of the panel that political, religious or other
reasons threaten the claimant's safety is enough to clear the way to
immigrant status.
   The special program was needed only for the backlog because a new
system is intended to reject false refugee claims upon arrival in
Canada. A limited amnesty was declared in May 1986 for about 22,000
people who were then claiming refugee status, granting residency to
all who already had jobs or family in Canada and no criminal record.
   The backlog of refugee claims has increased steadily from 6,500
in 1984 to the current level, which would take five to seven years
to clear under the present system.
   Alan Shefman of the Ontario Human Rights Commission said in a
phone interview there was cautious optimism that the refugee
claimants will get ``fair and quick hearings.'' He said the
organization was relieved that the claimants will be able to work
while awaiting a decision.
   Canada, the world's second-largest country in territory, has a
population of 26 million. It traditionally has encouraged
immigration, and the government has raised its target from 125,000
to 135,000 in 1988 to 150,000 to 160,000 next year.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed three
infiltrators who crossed the border from Egypt, and mounted searches
Thursday in the Negev Desert for a fourth man who escaped, a
military spokesman said.
   It was not immediately clear if the infiltration Wednesday
involved guerrillas or possibly smugglers. The army withheld reports
of the incident until Thursday, apparently to prevent panic among
the public.
   An army spokesman said no identification papers or weapons were
found on the bodies. One military official said, however, that the
possibility they were terrorists ``has not been ruled out.''
   The infiltration came on the heels of three attempts earlier this
week by Palestinian guerrillas to enter Israel from Lebanon.
   Nine guerrillas were killed in those attacks, which were seen as
attempts by dissident Syrian-backed groups to disrupt the PLO's
dialogue with the United States.
   Speaking to reporters, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the
U.S. decision earlier this month to open a dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization had created a climate for
increased attacks.
   ``It is a fact that the latest American decision to have talks
with the PLO has encouraged the tendency of violent acts against
Israel,'' he said.
   The last major infiltration from Egypt was in March, when three
Palestinian guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three Israeli
civilians before they were shot to death. The PLO's Force 17 claimed
responsibility.
   Soldiers first detected the infiltration Wednesday when they
found footprints leading across Israel's southern border with Egypt,
said a military spokesman, who cannot be identified by name under
army rules.
   He said troops followed the tracks to a small truck south of the
town of Mitzpe Ramon, 10 miles from the border with Egypt.
   The soldiers opened fire when the driver ignored an order to stop
and killed three men. A fourth escaped, he said.
   Military helicopters circled above the Negev desert Thursday as
searches for the missing man continued, Israel army radio said.
   State radio said the resort town of Eilat, 90 miles south of
Mitzpe Ramon, was cut off from the rest of the country for most of
the day after the army closed the road for its searches.
   On Monday, Israeli troops killed three suspected Palestinian
guerrillas not far from Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Three
more guerrillas were killed in the same area on Wednesday.
   Also Monday, three guerrillas drowned when their boat capsized
off the coast of southern Lebanon as they made their way to the
northern Israeli coast.
   The army spokesman denied rumors that two Israeli soldiers were
injured in the gunfight.

<HEAD>Academy Wants Radar Station to Monitor Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet scientists have recommended a Siberian radar
station that the United States says violates the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty be turned into an ecological center, Radio Moscow
reported Thursday.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev previously offered to turn over
the giant, phased-array radar in Krasnoyarsk to a civilian agency,
but the United States had rejected anything short of dismantling the
station.
   Disputes over the observance of the 1972 ABM Treaty are among the
differences that have stymied superpower negotiations on a treaty to
halve U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long-range, offensive nuclear
weapons.
   The Soviet Academy of Science suggested that the Krasnoyarsk
radar center would make a good international ecological center
because its equipment is capable of closely measuring atmospheric
processes caused by air pollution, the official radio said.
   On Sept. 27, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said at the
United Nations the radar should become part of an international
space organization. He did not specifically say it would be
dismantled. He also said U.S. radars in Greenland and Britain should
be converted.
   The Kremlin announced in October that it was giving the station,
which is in central Siberia, to the Academy of Sciences, and Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said it would be turned over
to international space study.
   But the U.S. government said the move was unsatisfactory because
it did not include the complete dismantling of the radar.
   The United States says the plant violates provisions of the ABM
treaty that specify that radar stations capable of giving advanced
warnings of missile attacks may only be located on the periphery of
U.S. or Soviet territory.

<HEAD>Panel Proposes Closing 34 Military Installations; Approval Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government commission called Thursday for
closing 34 military installations, including five major Air Force
bases and the Army's second-largest basic training site, in a
recommendation that could send economic shock waves to communities
across America.
   In addition, the Commission on Base Realignment and Closure
recommended closing 52 military housing units in 13 states that date
back to the construction of Nike missile bases in the 1950s, and
partially closing five military facilities and changing the mission
_ and the manpower levels _ at 54 other facilities.
   The panel's recommendations appeared to have a good chance of
taking effect. If Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci approves them,
as expected, Congress would have to reject the whole list in order
to save any of the facilities. And even such a resolution of
disapproval could be vetoed by President-elect George Bush after he
moves into the White House on Jan. 20.
   Carlucci, who has strongly supported the work of the bipartisan
commission, has until Jan. 15 _ five days before leaving office _ to
either accept or reject the entire list.
   The first overhaul in 11 years of the nation's web of 3,800
military installations could save an estimated $693 million a year
without hindering the national security, said Abraham Ribicoff, a
former Democratic senator from Connecticut and co-chairman of the
panel.
   The $693 million savings is minuscule when compared with the
Pentagon's annual budget of $300 billion.
   The states hit hardest by the panel's recommendations were
California, which would lose five major installations; and Illinois,
which would lose two. The area of the nation faring best was the
South, which wouldn't lose any major facilities.
   The five Air Force bases recommended for closure include Chanute
in Illinois; George, Mather and Norton in California, and Pease, in
New Hampshire. Their missions would be shifted to other bases.
   Also closed would be the Presidio, a major Army administrative
base in San Francisco; and Fort Douglas in Utah, a facility built in
1862 to protect Pony Express riders from Indians. It has often been
cited as a prime example of unneeded bases.
   The five bases that would be partially shut down include Fort
Dix, N.J., where 33,490 recruits underwent basic training in the
year that ended Sept. 30. Only Fort Jackson, S.C., trains more
recruits. Fort Dix would go on semi-active status at a loss of 4,686
military and civilian jobs.
   Fifty-four other bases should be realigned, meaning they would
either gain or lose personnel, the commission said.
   Also closed would be part of Fort Meade, Md.; and the
Philadelphia Naval Hospital, which the Navy has long wanted to shut
down.
   The panel called for halting construction at three sites where
the Navy wanted to built new ports for its growing fleet of ships
and closing the sites. They are the Hunters Point Naval Station in
San Francisco; the Galveston, Texas, Naval Station; and the Lake
Charles, La., Naval Station.
   The early reaction from Congress was generally positive. Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said
``the odds are heavily in favor'' of the list becoming law.
   ``My general feeling is this will be well received by the
Congress,'' he said. Nunn's state would not lose any major bases.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Armed Services
Committee, agreed. ``I think the recommendation will make it all the
way through,'' he said.
   But Sens. Alan Dixon and Paul Simon, both Illinois Democrats,
noted their state is losing Chanute Air Force Base and the Army's
Fort Sheridan. They complained that overseas bases should be closed
before any U.S. facilities are mothballed.
   Ribicoff and panel co-chairman Jack Edwards, a former Republican
congressman from Alabama, predicted some legislators would be
unhappy but said Congress isn't likely to overturn the decision.
   Legislators with bases on the reduction list are ``going to be
unhappy and we understand that,'' said Edwards. ``But we feel like
the majority of the House and Senate will support what we have
done.''
   Local communities will be unhappy, Edwards said. ``Of course,
they will have a hard time swallowing'' the decision. In some
communities, a military base provides a source of employment and a
sure source of income in good times and bad.
   Edwards said he was sympathetic with communities that would lose
facilities because an Air Force base closed in his district 25 years
ago, costing 14,000 jobs. ``I certainly understand the impact,'' he
said.
   Closed bases mean lost jobs and Congress has refused to permit
any major closures since 1977, when the first of a thicket of rules
and regulations was enacted to make it hard for the Pentagon to pare
down the installation list.
   The 12-member panel was created this year as a way to circumvent
such congressional roadblocks and there were predictions the annual
savings might be as high as $2 billion to $5 billion.
   The savings estimate provided by the commission ``does fall short
of the savings estimates which many had predicted,'' Nunn said.
   But Hayden B. Bryan, executive director of the panel, said those
early estimates ``were just pulled out of the air.''
   The panel, working in strict secrecy, considered a number of
factors, including military utility and whether a base's functions
could be better carried out at another location.
   Another requirement was that the one-time costs of closing a
base, such as severance pay and waste clean-up, would be offset
within six years by the money that would be saved.
   ``Our report represents an opportunity to reduce training costs
in terms of manpower, overhead costs and fuel, to improve command
and control, consolidate training and improve economies of scale and
to remove unnecessary administrative burdens to our defense
managers,'' Edwards said.
   Two installations _ Loring Air Force Base in Maine and Virginia's
Fort Monroe _ escaped even though they have long been included on
critics' lists of unneeded bases. It was the Air Force's attempt to
close Loring in 1977 which prompted the congressional roadblocks to
the Pentagon's base realignment efforts.
   Fort Monroe was originally built with a moat to protect U.S.
forces from British attack in the War of 1812.
   Edwards said Loring and Fort Monroe escaped the ax because they
have developed new uses in recent years, meaning they didn't met the
commission's complicated set of criteria for closing a base.
   While some of the 34 bases that would be closed are major
installations with big payrolls, others are far smaller
installations.
   The latter include such places as Fort Wingate, a New Mexico site
where the Army stores ammunition and which employs only 92 people;
the Army's Tacony Warehouse in Philadelphia; and Hamilton Army
Airfield near San Francisco, which employs only 29 people and is
used only as a training center for reservists.

   The law and order minister
Thursday banned four anti-apartheid groups, using state-of-emergency
regulations that have shut down 28 other organizations this year.
   Two of the latest targets were teachers' unions and a third was a
student group that coordinated anti-government protests this year in
mixed-race townships near Cape Town.
   The fourth banned group was the National Detainees Forum,
established in July to carry on monitoring work that had been
conducted by the Detainees Parents Support Committee before its
banning in February.
   Both watchdog groups have played a major role in providing
information on the thousands of activists, most of them black,
detained without charge for varying periods during the 30-month-old
state of emergency.
   A statement issued on behalf of Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok said the predominantly black Democratic Teachers Union and the
predominantly mixed-race Western Cape Teachers Union had promoted
``people's education'' _ an effort by non-white communities to exert
greater control over curriculum in their schools.
   A year ago, the Cabinet minister for black education, Gerrit
Viljoen, said the government saw important positive elements in
people's education. But Lt. Peet Bothma, a spokesman for Vlok, said
Thursday that the concept was inspired by the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   The two teachers' unions, both founded in 1985, were
``politicizing education and discrediting the education system,''
said Bothma. ``Both are involved in the broad revolutionary
onslaught against South Africa which could escalate into strikes,
boycotts, terror and unrest incidents.''
   Bothma said the government had similar concerns about the
predominantly mixed-race Western Cape Students Congress, one of a
dozen youth and student groups banned this year.
   Thousands of mixed-race students around Cape Town, in some cases
supported by faculty, staged a widespread classroom boycott in April
to protest detentions and harassment of students and teachers.
   The latest bannings were denounced by South Africa's Human Rights
Commission. It described the government as ``power-drunk'' and said
that only 24 organizations had been banned in a 37-year period
before 1988.
   The newly banned organizations ``have never been accused in court
of any illegal actions,'' the commission said in a statement.
``Their bannings are a result of their steadfast opposition to
apartheid policies.''
   The 17 groups affected by the initial banning orders in February
included the largest anti-apartheid coalition, the United Democratic
Front, and a nationwide black-consciousness group, the Azanian
People's Organization.
   The main anti-apartheid labor federation, the Congress of South
African Trade Unions, was prohibited from political activity as part
of the crackdown, although it has not muted its criticism of the
government.
   But much of the above-ground leadership of the anti-apartheid
movement has shifted to an alliance of clergymen, including Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the
World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   The country's main mixed-race political party Thursday ended its
annual conference with a pledge to seek contacts with the African
National Congress.
   Labor Party delegates rejected a proposal to quit Parliament as a
protest against apartheid, but resolved to take more initiative in
working with non-parliamentary groups to undermine the white
government's racial policies.
   Parliament has chambers for whites, Asians and people of mixed
race, but the black majority is excluded.

<HEAD>Brazilian Police Step Up Manhunt For Killer of Ecologist</HEAD>

   Police said Thursday they have
located five more cattle ranchers who may be linked to the slaying
of a prominent ecologist who fought to protect the Amazon forest.
   Three other cattlemen already have been arrested in the death of
Francisco Mendes, 44, who was gunned down Dec. 22 outside his home
about 50 miles outside of Brasilia.
   About 80 officers from Brasilia and Sao Paulo were transferred
Wednesday to the western Amazon state of Acre to search the jungles
for suspects in the death, said Deputy Justice Minister Luis
Fernando Eichenberg.
   ``Overnight, the police located five ranchers who may be suspects
in the Mendes case but nothing has been confirmed,'' Eichenberg
said. He gave no further details.
   Eichenberg, contacted by telephone in Brasilia, refused to
confirm press reports that said five suspects _ all cattle ranchers
_ had been arrested by police on a ranch near the jungle village of
Xapuri, where Mendes was slain. Xapuri is about 2,600 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Police already were holding in custody three sons of Darly Alves
da Silva, a cattle rancher who Mendes had said sent him death
threats. Mendes led a local rubber tappers union that fought against
clearing the Amazon for cattle grazing.
   Mendes last year received a United Nations Global 500 prize given
to top ecologists worldwide.
   Eichenberg said police had found several clues indicating that
Oloci Alves da Silva, captured Tuesday after a gun battle on the
family ranch in Xapuri, was at the scene of the Mendes shooting.
   ``The police have analyzed several cigarette butts found in front
of Mendes' house, and Oloci is known to have smoked the same
brand,'' said the Justice Minisitry official. ``This and other clues
lead us to believe he was present when Mendes was killed.''
   Also being held were 21-year-old Darcy Pereira da Silva, who
claims to have killed Mendes, and his brother Aleci Alves da Silva.
Police have said they doubt Darcy da Silva participated in Mendes'
slaying and that he is being used as a decoy by his father, whose
whereabouts is unknown.
   Eichenburg said the police would extend ``possibly throughout the
month of January'' a ``sweep operation,'' begun Wednesday to find
and confiscate illegal weapons in the region in a push to halt
land-dispute violence in the western Amazon.
   For the second day, police flew over the jungle in helicopters
and search planes. They set up road blocks along highways and the
state's border with Bolivia in the search for da Silva and any
unregistered weapons.
   ``The atmosphere in Acre is extremely tense and it is up to the
police to control any further outbreaks of violence,'' said
Eichenburg.
   The battles over the Amazon jungle, an expanse of rainforest
about two-thirds the size of continental United States, has often
erupted in bloody clashes.
   Cattle ranchers, eager to clear forest lands for grazing, often
order the killings of squatters and ecologists who oppose them.

<HEAD>Agriculture Department To Establish Offices At Black Schools</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Thursday it
will establish offices at each of 17 historically black universities
to help encourage more minorities to enter agriculture and forestry.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said the offices will be ``a
focal point for all USDA activities'' at the universities,
collectively known as 1890 institutions because of land-grant
college legislation that year.
   A few department agencies have offices at some of those schools,
but Myers said this will be the first time that there will be an
on-campus link between USDA and each of the universities.
   Myers said the offices will help with curriculum development,
recruit and counsel students on employment opportunities in USDA,
and develop new ideas and approaches to help small-scale,
limited-resource and minority farmers.
   ``From international trade to the revitalization of rural
America, there are numerous career opportunities in agriculture and
forestry,'' he said. ``USDA is strengthening its ties to the 1890
institution to ensure that minority youth know of those
opportunities and are encouraged to seek out careers in
agriculture.''
   Myers said USDA is recruiting among current employees for the
liaison offices and expects to have all positions filled by April.
   The 17 institutions are:
   Alabama A&M, Huntsville.
   Alcorn State University, Lorman, Miss.
   University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff.
   Delaware State College, Dover.
   Florida A&M University, Tallahassee.
   Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley, Ga.
   Kentucky State University, Frankfort.
   Langston University, Langston, Okla.
   Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Mo.
   Unversity of Maryland-Eastern Shore, Princess Anne.

   Talks between South Korea and North Korea
on easing tension suffered a sharp setback Thursday when North Korea
demanded an end to U.S.-South Korean military exercises.
   The five-member delegations of both sides agreed to meet again
Feb. 10 at this truce village inside the Demilitarized Zone
seprating the two nations.
   The three-hour meeting plunged into stalemate a few minutes after
it opened when North Korea issued a new demand for an end to annual
U.S.-South Korea ``Team Spirit'' exercises it says threaten its
security.
   The chief North Korean delegate, Chon Kum Chul, said this was a
precondition for the parliamentary talks and other proposals for
inter-Korea contacts.
   ``Team Sprit war exercises have created a state of quasi-war and
affected South-North talks in progress. The exercises have been the
biggest obstacle blocking the progress of dialogue,'' Chon said.
   His South Korean counterpart, Chai Mun-shick, accused North Korea
of laying a new obstacle before the talks and insisted the issue be
addressed at other government-level talks expected early next year.
North Korea rejected the idea.
   South Korea and the United States hold annual spring military
exercises to practice their joint command system in the event of a
North Korean invasion. About 200,000 troops of both sides took part
in last year's exercises from February to April.
   South Korea had hoped before Thursday's meeting, the seventh
since August, that agreement was near on setting terms for
full-scale talks between each side's legislatures after making
progress at a Nov. 17 meeting.
   Chai expressed ``surprise and suspicion'' at North Korea's new
demand and asked that it be dropped, saying the exercises are annual
and defensive.
   ``North Korea's demand is very disappointing. I suspect that
their resolve to make the talks a success has weakened,'' Chai said
after the meeting.
   Chon declined to withdraw the demand and suggested the military
exercises could be an obstacle to the parliamentary talks and
proposals for separate government and sports talks.
   Rep. Park Kwan-yong, an opposition member on the South Korean
delegation, said North Korea used the same tactics three years ago.
   Park, a member of South Korean negotiating team in talks with
North Korea in 1985, said lawmakers of both sides were close to
agreement and scheduled to meet in mid-February in 1986. North Korea
unilaterally suspended all dialogue to protest the ``Team Spirit''
exercises.
   The meeting was held the day after Seoul sent a message to North
Korea agreeing to separate political and military talks on arms
reductions and other tension-easing measures.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon wrote his North Korean
counterpart, Yon Hyung Muk, that they head delegations to
alternating talks in Seoul and Pyongyang to discuss
non-interference, cooperation in select areas and building ``mutual
trust in military matters.''
   South Korea has yet to respond to three more North Korean
proposals for political, military and sports talks. One proposal
seeks the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed here under
a mutual defense treaty.
   Talks have been held on and off since the early 1970s with little
progress. Both sides have tended to stress their respective
initiatives and play down the other's proposals.
   The two Koreas have hundreds of thousands of troops facing each
other along the 150-mile border. The border is sealed and there are
no communications except for a hot line.
   U.S. and Soviet forces divided the Korean peninsula when they
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II in 1945.
North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950 to start the Korean War.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission issued a
warning Thursday about the unauthorized use of emergency locator
transmitters used to aid in the search and rescue of downed or
disabled aircraft.
   The warning was directed at users of emergency personal locators,
for which ``misleading advertisements'' imply that these devices are
authorized for use by backpackers and hikers to alert search and
rescue personnel, the FCC said.
   Emergency locator transmitters are authorized for use only by
aircraft in distress or in an aeronautical emergency. Their use for
any other purpose is prohibited because it would jeopardize the
effectiveness of the transmitters in aeronautical search and rescue
operations, the FCC said.
   The frequencies allocated to emergency locator transmitters
``cannot accommodate an additional large number of personal users
such as backpackers and hikers,'' the commission said in its warning.
   The penalty for unauthorized use of these transmitters includes
fines up to $10,000 and possible imprisonment, it said.
   The FCC said ads for emergency personal locators have appeared in
sales catalogs, but it did not identify the publications. Officials
at the agency said they did not know whether unauthorized use of
these transmitters has hampered any aeronautical search and rescue
operations.

   Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu said
in a rare interview with a Western newspaper that his controversial
plan to raze 7,000 villages is needed to modernize the countryside.
   In a related development, a Frankfurt-based human rights
organization said Romanian border police this year have killed at
least 400 Romanians, many of Hungarian or German descent, trying to
flee to Yugoslavia.
   Among the villages to be razed under Ceausescu's plan are most of
those where ethnic Hungarians or Germans form a majority of the
local population.
   The Bonn daily newspaper Die Welt said the autocratic Communist
Party ruler spoke in a recent interview in Bucharest, Romania's
capital. Die Welt released excerpts of the interview to news
agencies before its publication Friday.
   ``Our villages should systematically take on a new appearance,''
Ceausescu was quoted as saying. ``Romanians in the third millenium
must belong to a nation with a higher living standard enjoyed by
each citizen in equal measure.''
   Ceausescu last spring revealed plans for destroying about 7,000
of Romania's 13,000 villages and resettling residents in housing
complexes attached to agro-industrial centers.
   The plan is aimed at providing more farmland and at modernizing
the agricultural industry, but it has drawn criticism from East and
West.
   Foreign critics, including former U.S. Ambassador David
Funderburk, contend Ceausescu is trying to wipe out the vestiges of
Romania's capitalist and religious past.
   Last month, the Romanian leader appeared to back down somewhat
from his announcement the villages would ``disappear'' under his
resettlement plan. He said at the time that some communes in rural
Romania would be preserved to avoid depopulating the countryside.
   In the Die Welt interview, Ceausescu reiterated that those who
want to stay in their village homes will be allowed to.
   But he contended that a systematic consolidation of rural
residents into agricultural centers is necessary to improve living
conditions, transport and labor productivity.
   Ceausescu has said the relocation project should be completed by
2000.
   So far, only scattered villages near the capital, Bucharest, have
been razed, but the policy has caused widespread disruption in the
countryside and disturbed relations with foreign countries,
particularly allied Hungary.
   The International Society for Human Rights in Frankfurt said
Thursday that the Romanian-Yugoslavian border is ``the bloodiest in
Europe.''
   Romanians have attempted to flee the country in droves, and at
least 400 have been shot and killed by Romanian border police in the
past year, the private human rights group said in a dispatch to news
media.
   It said an even larger number of Romanians drowned while trying
to escape by swimming the Danube, which borders the two countries,
but it did not give a figure.
   The society said many of those who succeeded in reaching
Yugoslavia were sent back to Romania, unless the refugees managed to
contact United Nations authorities in Belgrade.
   In Budapest, Hungary, the commander of Hungary's border guards
said 6,974 Romanians have tried to cross illegally into Hungary this
year, a four-fold increase over last year.
   But the commander, Janos Szekely, disputed reports that hundreds
of Romanians attempting to flee to Hungary were shot and killed by
Romanian border guards.
   An estimated 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians,
have found refuge in Hungary, which in January took the
unprecedented step of accepting refugees from a fellow Warsaw Pact
country.
   Szekely said 1,400 Romanians who fled illegally into Hungary were
returned to Romania, but he said they were ``undesirables'' such as
common criminals, vagrants and teen-age delinquents.
   Die Welt also quoted Ceausescu as rejecting the reforms of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a model for other socialist
nations.
   ``There is no model, no stencil, for development in the socialist
world,'' Ceausescu was quoted as saying. ``Each nation must
differentiate itself in this way.''
   The newspaper said Ceausescu also rejected suggestions that his
efforts to pay off foreign loans have harshly affected living
conditions in Romania, including widespread shortages of power, food
and consumer goods.
   He acknowledged ``a few difficulties,'' but he said the
government has brought prices under control and expects a stable
energy situation in two years.

   Passengers traveling on U.S. airlines were
questioned about their luggage and had their bags X-rayed Thursday
in a security clampdown at British airports prompted by the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The disclosure that plastic explosives blew up the Boeing 747 on
Dec. 21, killing all 259 people and 11 on the ground, set off a
worldwide hunt for the perpetrators.
   The British foreign secretary called for the cooperation of
governments in the Middle East, where Palestinian and Iranian
extremists are key suspects.
   President-elect George Bush said he would ``severely punish'' the
bombers if they were found.
   At Britain's four airports that handle U.S. carriers, passengers
fed their checked luggage through X-ray machines and were asked
about who packed their bags, when they were packed, whether the bags
had been out of their sight since, and whether strangers gave them
parcels to carry.
   The X-rayed suitcases were bound in a tough plastic strip to
prevent them from being opened between the check-in desks and the
plane. Anything arousing suspicion was opened and searched by hand.
   At Heathrow Airport's busy Terminal 3, used by U.S. carriers Pan
Am and TWA, police patrolled with submachine guns issued to them
after 1986 terrorist incidents in Europe.
   ``Sure there's a risk, but you've got more chance of getting
killed on a street in New York,'' said Sam Fleischacker, a
Philadelphia college professor rushing to catch a TWA flight to New
York.
   He said he flew to London on vacation the day after the Pan Am
crashed into the Scottish village of Lockerbie, and ``I was worried
then.'' Gesturing to the X-ray machine, he said: ``What worries me a
lot too is that they didn't have all this then.''
   As he spoke, he drifted a few feet away from his bags and was
promptly upbraided by ground staff for leaving them unattended.
   On Wednesday, the Department of Transport ordered the four
British airports handling U.S. carriers to step up security. Hank
Auerbach, Pan Am's chief in northern Europe, said the airline had
met ``all the requirements set by the Department of Transport.'' He
refused to elaborate.
   In France, police said security was heightened at Paris' Charles
de Gaulle and Orly airports, with undisclosed measures for U.S.
carriers. Officials at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport also said
they had increased security.
   The British directive took effect a few hours after Wednesday's
disclosure that a bomb blew Flight 103 out of the sky. The directive
was aimed at Heathrow, neighboring Gatwick, Manchester in northern
England and Prestwick in Scotland.
   Amid a now familiar debate about what else can be done to protect
airlines from terrorists, analysts speculated that the bomb could
have been smuggled aboard in a suitcase, or into the cargo hold by
ground staff.
   Many looked to El Al, Israel's national carrier, which has had
long experience fighting terrorism and hand-searches all baggage.
British lawmaker David Wilshire, whose constituency includes
Heathrow, said El Al also puts freight through simulated pressure
procedures, so that any bomb set to be detonated by altitude changes
would explode on the ground.
   Brian Jenkins, a U.S. terrorism consultant, said key tasks for
the investigators were to check the background of every passenger on
Flight 103 and look for false identities; to discover whether any
had connections that could make them ``witting or unwitting''
accomplices; and to trace every item of cargo back to its origins.
   The investigation involves Scottish police, the British
anti-terrorism squad, the FBI and West German federal police.
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe asked for the cooperation of
Middle East governments.
   ``This may well be a long, painstaking, structured matter,''
warned Detective Chief Superintendent John Orr of the Glasgow area
police, who is heading the criminal investigation.
   Police officers flew to West Germany Thursday as part of the
investigation, Orr said in Lockerbie. He said officers also would be
sent to ``other parts of the world.'' He declined to elaborate.
   Washington has offered a $500,000 reward for information leading
to those responsible for the crash.
   Bush, asked for his reaction to the air tragedy, said Thursday:
``Well, horror. And seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those
who did this, if you could ever find them.''
   But Charles Price, the U.S. ambassador to Britain, said the U.S.
government was unlikely to retaliate if the killers were identified.
   ``I don't know of any contingency plans that involve some form of
retaliation on our part and I can't imagine that it is very
likely,'' Price told reporters at Heathrow before boarding a British
Airways Concorde jet en route to California for New Year's. He said
he would return to Lockerbie Jan. 4 to attend a memorial service for
the victims.
   In a field outside a church in the countryside near Lockerbie,
engineers sawed up the plane's nose section for removal. John
Wagner, the brother of co-pilot Raymond Wagner, visited the church
and asked for and was given two Bibles as mementos for the family,
said the minister, the Rev. Cameron Gibson.
   Relatives laid wreaths by the cockpit, while in Lockerbie, a
crane lifted one of the engines out of the 15-foot-deep crater in
which it had lain for eight days.
   So far, 241 bodies have been found but only 16 have been
identified and released for burial. Six Americans and a Briton were
identified Thursday.
   They are the plane's pilot, James Bruce MacQuarrie, 55, of
Kensington, N.H., co-pilot Wagner, 52, of Pennington, N.J., Melina
Hudson, 16, of Albany, N.Y., Joseph Kenneth Miller, 56, of Woodmere,
N.Y., Douglas Eugene Merlicote, 22, Army Post Office, N.Y., Martin
Bernard Christopher Simpson, 52, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Elyse Jeanne
Saraceni, 20, of London.

<HEAD>Judge Stays Out Of Dispute Over Communist Student Government Leader</HEAD>

   A judge Thursday declined to get
involved in a dispute over the election of a communist student body
leader at the University of Massachusetts, saying the students and
university should resolve the matter.
   The student, Jason Rabinowitz, was elected co-president of the
student government last spring with Shari Silkoff, a self-described
progressive.
   But they had been barred from taking office by a student judicial
body on the ground that the student constitution prohibited
co-presidents.
   Rabinowitz and Silkoff contended they were barred because of
their political beliefs, and they asked Superior Court Judge
Elizabeth Porada to issue an injunction assuring their right to take
office.
   In turning down the request, Porada wrote that the matter is
``best left to the decision of the students, student senate and
university judiciary without the intervention by the courts or
trustees of the university.''
   The judge also said an injunction was unnecessary because the
school's Student Supreme Court had recently lifted its own ban
against the two students taking office.
   The students' election still must be ratified by the Student
Government Association's Senate.
   Edward Etheredge, an attorney for Rabinowitz and Silkoff, said
the students were away for the holidays but that he had expected the
judge's decision.
   He added that because of the recent ruling by the Student Supreme
Court, his clients had moved back into their offices.
   ``The issue now is whether the university pays Jason and Shari
their back compensation and attorney's fees. If they don't, we'll be
back in court,'' he said.
   University attorney Terrence O'Malley was reported to be out of
his office Thursday afternoon and could not be reached for comment.
   Running as a team, Rabinowitz _ a founding member of the Young
Communist League _ and Silkoff were elected in March by 1,454 votes,
a 361-vote margin over a conservative candidate at the
19,000-undergraduate school.
   A month after the election, the Student Supreme Court barred the
two from the post.
   The presidency of the Student Government Association is a paid
position with the power to hire and appoint other students to the
government body.
   Rabinowitz and Silkoff argued that bylaws allow for
co-presidents, and that the student judicial tribunal consisted of
conservatives hand-picked by a student attorney general, who was
chief among their political foes.
   The Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts sued on their behalf,
alleging that their civil rights were violated by campus
conservatives intent on keeping them from office.

   Leaders of the military committees in Congress
said Thursday they like the base-closing recommendations made by a
special commission and predicted the proposals will be accepted by
Congress.
   ``I have a positive reaction,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a news conference.
``This process is a step forward. ... I would have liked to have
seen more.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, told reporters he supports the plan and will urge
colleagues to do likewise.
   Aspin said his only criticism was that the commission's report
was ``too modest'' and that the list of targeted bases could have
been up to about 30 percent larger. He did not specify what other
bases could have been included.
   ``This is a good start,'' said Virginia Sen. John Warner, a
former Navy secretary who is the ranking Republican on Nunn's
committee. He said the commission's report ``confirmed that there
are inefficient aspects of our defense budget.''
   The three lawmakers said they believe the panel's recommendations
to close 86 installations and reduce or alter operations at 59
others will be accepted by Congress, which would face an
all-or-nothing decision once the report reaches Capitol Hill after a
review by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   ``My general feeling is this will be well received by the
Congress,'' Nunn said. ``The odds are heavily in favor of this
becoming the law of the land.''
   Warner told reporters he believes ``the recommendation will make
it all the way through'' Congress, which created the commission this
year to break the impasse that has prevented lawmakers from agreeing
on any major closings since 1977.
   Warner and Nunn said budget deficits require the Defense
Department and Congress to look toward further base closings and
consolidations to generate more economies than the $693 million a
year the commission says its plan would save.
   ``I think this ought to be a continuous source of study by the
new (defense) secretary,'' said Nunn, who wants overseas basis
included in such a review. ``There's still a way to go in terms of a
complete review based on the new budget circumstances.''
   Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif., said his initial reaction to the plan
was positive. Lowery is the ranking GOP member of the Appropriations
subcommittee on military construction, which would have the initial
House say on financing the closure plan.
   Lowery represents San Diego, which would be a winner under the
plan, gaining five Navy ships, 1,473 military personnel and 22
civilian jobs _ all of which had been slated for San Francisco.
   ``There is no question in these tight budgetary times we are
going to have to do more with less,'' Lowery said in a statement.
   Sen. Bill Roth, R-Del., one of the principal authors of the law
that created the commission, said the recommendations are ``a
crucial step towards achieving real savings for the American
taxpayer.'' Delaware had no bases on ths hit list.
   But Illinois did _ Fort Sheridan and Chanute Air Force Base _ and
its two Democratic senators issued a joint statement saying the
commission should have looked at overseas bases before targeting
domestic installations.
   ``How can we justify closing military bases in our own back yard
when we don't even consider a single one of the 1,500 overseas U.S.
military facilities for the same treatment?'' said Sen. Alan Dixon,
chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on readiness.
   ``The overseas bases ought to be looked at first to make sure the
need is still there,'' Sen. Paul Simon said.
   Nunn and Warner said they thought the commission had done the
best job it could under various constraints, some imposed by the
Pentagon and others, like a relatively short study period, imposed
by Congress.
   Nunn said the panel had to use current Pentagon budget figures,
even though the new spending plan going to Congress next month is
expected to be lower, changing the parameters for evaluating the
need for some bases.
   He specifically said the commission approached Navy installations
with the assumption the U.S. battle fleet would have 600 ships, a
goal he said is not attainable in the forseeable future.
   Nunn also questioned wby the Pentagon prevented the commission
from studying the need for defense facilities owned by the
government and operated by private contractors.

<HEAD>Mother Of Baby M Expecting Fifth Child; To Promote Upcoming Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould is
pregnant with her fifth child and is planning a 22-city promotional
tour in March of a book she co-wrote about the Baby M case, her
lawyer and publisher said Thursday.
   ``The book's focus is going to be a lot about the ills of how
people are affected by surrogacy,'' said Robert D. Arenstein, her
attorney. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould feels ``it's her duty to convey to
the public what surrogacy has done to her.''
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's unsuccessful legal fight to keep the child
she agreed to bear for another couple sparked nationwide debate on
surrogacy contracts.
   The book, ``A Mother's Story,'' was written with Pennsylvania
investigative journalist Loretta Schwartz-Nobel and published by St.
Martin's Press.
   The first printing will be 100,000 copies, and the company has
set aside $100,000 for advertising and promotion, said Maryanne
Mazzola, publicity director for the publisher.
   The 31-year-old Mrs. Whitehead-Gould lives in Bayport, N.Y., with
her second husband and three of her children _ Ryan, 14; Tuesday,
12, and Austin, 7 months, Arenstein said.
   ``She is pregnant and she is happy about it,'' the attorney added.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould gave birth in 1986 to the girl originally
known in court papers as Baby M. At the time, she was married to
Richard Whitehead.
   When she refused to give up the child, whom she agreed to bear
under a $10,000 contract for William and Elizabeth Stern of Tenafly,
N.J., a landmark court battled ensued.
   Stern, eventually granted custody of the girl by the New Jersey
Supreme Court, had tried to stop Mrs. Whitehead-Gould from writing
the book, arguing it would exploit the child, named Melissa.
   But a Superior Court judge ruled that the book could focus on
Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's relationship with the child up until her
second birthday.

   The Soviet Union continues to buy U.S. grain
under a recently extended long-term agreement between the two
countries, including a new deal for 420,000 metric tons of wheat at
subsidized prices, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part
of 2 million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment in January. Counting
some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, the Soviets
have about 1.6 million tons still available under the program.
   The Soviet Union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under
EEP arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. The
pact expired Sept. 30 but was later extended for another year.
   Department officials said also the Soviets bought an additional
314,256 tons of U.S. corn that had previously been reported by
exporters as headed for ``unknown destinations.'' The corn sales are
not subsidized.
   With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 10.4 million
tons of U.S. corn for delivery in the sixth year of the supply
agreement.
   The EEP arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly
less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized,
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 420,000 tons of
wheat would be about 15.4 million bushels. The latest corn sales
would be about 12.4 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $4 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $62 million. The corn, at $2.60 per bushel, could
have a farm value of about $32 million.
   Besides the corn and wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact,
the Soviets have ordered 450,000 tons of soybeans and 1,132,500 tons
of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.
   Goldthwaite said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy
rate of $21.75 per ton, or about 59 cents per bushel. He said the
bonuses on the 420,000 tons of wheat will be paid to three
companies: Cargill Inc., 120,000 tons; Continental Grain Co.,
250,000; and Richco Grain Ltd., 50,000.

   A gay midshipmen who says he was forced to
resign from the Naval Academy, after admitting his homosexuality two
months before his scheduled graduation, asked a federal court on
Thursday to order his reinstatement.
   Joseph C. Steffan, 24, of Moorhead, Minn., claimed in the suit
filed in U.S. District Court that his ``forced separation'' from the
academy violated his constitutional rights of free speech, due
process and equal protection under the law.
   Paula L. Ettelbrick, legal director for the Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund, a homosexual rights advocacy group acting as
Steffan's legal counsel, said that, to her knowledge, the suit is
the first of its kind against a service academy.
   Steffan, now employed by a computer software company in Fargo,
N.D., acknowledged that he was aware of a provision in the
midshipmen's manual that homosexuals would be dismissed from the
academy.
   Although Steffan said that he realized by the end of his
sophomore year that he was homosexual, he tried to keep it apart
from his life as a midshipman until he was informed in March 1987
that he was being investigated by the Navy.
   At the time Steffan was a battalion commander in charge of
one-sixth of the academy's 4,500 midshipmen, a solo performer with
the academy glee club, and in the top 10 percent of his class,
according to the suit.
   Upon learning of the Navy investigation, Steffan said he admitted
to a chaplain and then to the academy's commandant, Capt. H.W.
Habermeyer Jr., that we was a homosexual.
   Within eight days, a brigade performance board and an academic
board on the Annapolis, Md., campus recommended Steffan's discharge
after determining that he had an ``insufficient aptitude'' for a
Navy officer's commission, according to the suit.
   ``The boards said my evaluations were completely irrelevant,''
Steffan said at a news conference here Thursday. ``All they needed
to have was that I was gay. They never even looked at my record.''
   Steffan said he agreed to submit a qualified resignation rather
than fight a dismissal because of stress that his situation was
causing his family and because his father was suffering from high
blood pressure at the time.
   The suit names Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and Navy
Secretary William Ball in addition to the Naval Academy's
superintendent and commandant as defendants.
   Jay Fromer, a spokesman for the Naval Academy, said the school
only abided by Navy regulations.
   ``Since we are a part of the Department of the Navy, we are bound
by Navy regulations which state homosexuality is incompatible with
military service,'' Fromer said.
   In the suit, Steffan is seeking re-admission to the academy, a
diploma from it and a commission in the Navy, but he conceded the
unlikelihood of winning the latter by the time the case winds its
way through the courts.
   ``If I'm 30 years old at the time, I'm not going to be in much of
a position to go in as an ensign,'' he said. ``My goal is not only
to get a diploma but to have this policy of discimination reversed.''

<HEAD>Closure Of Historic Base Could Be Birth of Park</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The closing of the Presidio Army base on a
hillside overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge could transform one of
the city's loveliest spots into a park _ at the cost of thousands of
civilian jobs.
   The Presidio was one of 34 military bases recommended for closing
by a government commission Thursday. The panel also said the Navy
should not base the USS Missouri at Hunters Point, an issue that has
divided the city for years.
   The recommendation to close the Presidio surprised and
disappointed city officials and neighborhood businessmen, even
though the commission said the move would have minimal impact on
local employment.
   Founded by the Spanish in 1776 and operated as an Army base since
1846, the Presidio is one of the most important spots in San
Francisco history. Now headquarters of the 6th Army, it employs
about 3,000 civilians and 2,700 servicemen.
   ``I think it will have a significant effect on the economy unless
the commission is definite in recommending that there be economic
assistance to communities near bases,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a
Democrat whose district is next to the Presidio.
   The base, she said, is the third-largest employer in San
Francisco and has an annual payroll of $600 million.
   ``It's bad. We need this (base). I hope it doesn't happen,'' said
Bill Wakileh, a delicatessen owner who estimated that half his
business over the past 20 years has come from the nearby base.
   Mayor Art Agnos said the commission's decision had ``very grave
consequences'' for the city. He planned to meet with the local
congressional delegation to evaluate the effect of losing the base.
   ``For 112 years the Presidio has been an integral part of San
Francisco. It was here before San Francisco was a city. It's been a
very good neighbor and ... an important part of our economy,'' he
said.
   The site's future is restricted by the 1972 law that established
the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which includes most of the
base.
   Except for 36 acres belonging to the Letterman Army Medical
Center, all 1,490 acres would come under the control of the park.
The hospital also is slated for closing.
   Commercial development would not be allowed on the property, said
Brian O'Neill, the park area superintendent. Open space,
recreational and educational use and preservation of historic
buildings at the base would be the most likely uses, he said.
   Servicemen and civilians at the Presidio were apprehensive about
the prospect of leaving what many consider the most beautiful
military base in the nation, the site of last year's film ``The
Presidio,'' starring Sean Connery and Mark Harmon.
   ``It's long been considered a prime assignment. ... It's sort of
a combination military office building, museum and park all rolled
into one,'' said Jim Hudgins, Presidio chief of community relations.
   The base is mostly open to the public and is often the scene of
bicycle races, running events and picnics. Thousands of people
gather there every Fourth of July to watch fireworks over San
Francisco Bay.
   In its proposal to close the base, the commission said the
Presidio has no space for expansion and the Letterman hospital needs
structural repairs. Closure would save $74.1 million a year, the
committee estimated.
   The panel also said Hamilton Army Airfield in Marin County, the
airfield for the Presidio and a training center for reserve units,
should be shut down.
   The Navy, it said, should drop plans to base a battleship at the
Hunters Point Naval shipyard on the bay. A base was to be built
there if the Navy decided that the area should be the home port for
the Missouri and its group.
   The proposal to make San Francisco the battleship group's base
generated heavy debate. In November, voters narrowly passed a
proposition supporting the basing plan.
   Missouri supporters said the battleship group would pump millions
of dollars into the city's economy and provide hundreds of jobs.

<HEAD>Minor Malfunctions Reported on Mars Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some instruments have failed on board a satellite
headed for the Martian moon Phobos, but the mission is not in
jeopardy, the Soviet news agency Tass reported Thursday.
   The Soviets have lost the first of the pair of probes, Phobos I
and Phobos II, heading for Mars. Reports from the United States this
week said the second satellite also was experiencing problems,
putting the entire project in danger.
   ``Routine equipment checks revealed isolated malfunctions in some
of the instruments on board'' Phobos II, Tass said.
   But it quoted Garri Rogovsky of the Babakin Research and Testing
Center in Kaliningrad as saying that ``most have been rectified
while the rest won't prevent the research program from being carried
out in full.''
   Phobos I was launched on July 7, but in September a wrong
computer command caused it to stop responding to commands from Earth
and it was lost.
   Phobos II, launched days later, continues on course toward Mars.
It is to enter a Mars orbit late next month and approach the moon
Phobos in April.
   Its package of instruments and experiments were prepared by a
group of 12 countries and by the European Space Agency, but the
project is especially valuable to the Soviet Union because Soviet
scientists are aiming for a manned mission to Mars early in the 21st
century.
   Tass said Phobos I and Phobos II carried almost identical
equipment, but the lost probe carried instruments to register
neutron radiation from Phobos' surface and to study Mars' magnetic
field _ not included on Phobos II.
   On approaching Mars, Phobos II will take infrared and gamma ray
readings, compile a temperature map and data on its mineral make-up,
atmosphere and ionosphere, Tass said.
   Moving on to Phobos, it will drop to within 165 feet to analyze
the Martian moon's soil with the help of a laser, and then drop two
small landing craft onto the moon's surface.

   The Labor Department will hold hearings in
February and March on lifting a World War II-era regulation that
bars apparel manufacturers from employing seamstresses in their
homes, officials said Thursday.
   The department will publish in Friday's edition of the Federal
Register an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking as the first
formal step for lifting the ban, said Allan McMillan, a deputy
assistant labor secretary in charge of enforcing the prohibition.
   President-elect Bush urged the action last October after the
Labor Department won approval from the White House budget office to
remove homework prohibitions in five other apparel fields effective
Jan. 8.
   In a letter to Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin two weeks before
the election, Bush said he had been assured ``that the last piece of
this rulemaking will be given top priority for clearance.''
   McMillan said the Labor Department will hold hearings on the
proposal in Miami on Feb. 22-23; in San Antonio, Texas, on March
2-3; and in Chicago on March 8-9.
   ``The department believes that changing demographics such as more
women working demand increased workforce flexibility, including the
option to work in one's home,'' he said. ``The current ban
forecloses that possibility.''
   The prohibitions on apparel industry homework were imposedin 1942
to combat widespread exploitation of immigrants and other low-wage
workers. Lifting them has been the Reagan administration's top
deregulatory proposal in the labor relations area for the past
several years.
   The administration succeed in 1984 in removing the ban on knitted
outerwear but was thwarted by court rulings in response to suits
from unions in lifting the prohibitions in six other apparel fields.
   However, two days after the election, the Labor Department
announced it was removing the prohibitions, effective Jan. 8, in
five apparel fields: gloves and mittens, embroideries, buttons and
buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry.
   The Labor Department estimates between 9,000 and 100,000 workers
are employed in those five industries, compared with up to 500,000
in women's apparel.
   The International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which represents
some 170,000 workers, said last week it will seek a court injunction
next week to prohibit the further removal of any of the remaining
bans on homework.

   Two French girls held hostage in Lebanon for 13
months returned home Thursday night, six days after their captors _
the Palestinian guerrilla group commanded by Abu Nidal _ first
promised them freedom.
   Left behind in the hands of Fatah-Revolutionary Council were the
girls' mother, Jacqueline Valente; five Belgians also captured
aboard the yacht Silco; and a baby sister born in captivity.
   Marie-Laure Betille, 7, and her 6-year-old sister, Virginie,
landed at a military base in Istres, near Marseille, in a government
plane with their father, Pascal Betille, a spokeswoman for the
Foreign Ministry said.
   They came from the Libyan capital of Tripoli, where the girls
were handed over to French officials.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who bankrolls the guerrilla
faction, had called for the girls' release on Christmas Eve.
   Later Thursday, Libya's official JANA news agency quoted Gadhafi
as calling for the release of all hostages.
   ``Once again, I ask the Fatah-Revolutionary Council and the rest
of the liberation movements in the Middle East to respond to my
appeal for the release of the remaining hostages on this holy
occasion,'' Gadhafi was quoted as saying, in apparent reference to
Christmas.
   In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said ``France ... welcomes this
humanitarian gesture in appropriate measure'' and ``it thanks
foreign authorities who contributed.'' The statement did not
elaborate.
   The guerrilla group's spokesman, Walid Khaled, said in a
statement issued in Beirut, Lebanon, that the release was a ``gift
to the French authorities, all French political parties, the French
people and President (Francois) Mitterrand in the name of the
children of Palestine, the children of the revolution of the stones,
on the occasion of Christmas and New Year.'' He was referring to the
year-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   JANA said the girls received medical examinations and were found
to ``enjoy good health.''
   Betille, the girls' divorced father, told Radio-Television
Luxembourg in Tripoli that his children would undergo medical
examinations at a Marseille hospital.
   The girls arrived Thursday in the Libyan port of Benghazi, JANA
reported earlier, but it did not say from where.
   On Monday, Khaled said the girls were freed and on their way to
Paris, but they didn't turn up and the Palestinian group issued
contradictory statements.
   Two official cars were placed at the disposal of the girls'
family in Lyon, southeastern France, and the relatives were to leave
for Paris to welcome the children home.
   ``That's 14 months that we have been fighting for the release of
the hostages,'' said Andre Metral, brother-in-law of the girls'
mother. ``I remain reserved as long as I have not seen the two
little girls in the arms of their father.''
   His wife, Anne-Marie, sister of Ms. Valente, said: ``After hope
disappointed ... all these false joys have upset us. Now we know
that they are free, we want to see them and above all to continue
the fight for the other hostages.''
   Fatah Revolutionary Council announced the capture of the hostages
on Nov. 8, 1987, saying the yacht was seized off the coast of the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. It accused the captives of spying for
Israel, a charge that family members and Israel have denied.
   The group has been blamed for hijackings, bombings and
assassinations since it broke with PLO chief Yasser Arafat in 1976.
   Ms. Valente gave birth to a third child in captivity and said in
a recent videotape that she is pregnant again.
   The case is considered unrelated to the 15 Westerners held
hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions.

<HEAD>Indian Artifact No Fact, Says Reasearcher: In Fact, It's `Mammoth
Fraud'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A piece of shell jewelry once hailed as a
10,000-year-old Indian relic depicting a woolly mammoth is really
about 1,000 years old and was found in the last century by a shady
amateur archaeologist, an anthropologist says.
   David Meltzer of Southern Methodist University called the carving
resembling the animal that became extinct 10,000 years ago a
``mammoth fraud.'' He spent eight years researching the history of
the piece, a hand-size whelk shell pendant, and used carbon 14
dating to determine its age.
   The pendant was rediscovered in the 1970s by Smithsonian
Institution researchers who found it in a drawer, where it
apparently had lain since the end of the 19th century.
   It had been produced by Hilbourne T. Cresson as a discovery he'd
made in northern Delaware, near Holly Oak. But for some reason, the
artifact, known as the Holly Oak pendant, was forgotten about for
decades, Meltzer said.
   By the time it was noticed again, archaeologists had proven that
humans lived with woolly mammoths in the Western Hemisphere, at
least in the New Mexico area. It had been known since 1864 that man
lived at the same time as the beasts in Europe; that was the year
that a mammoth tusk was found at La Madeliene, France, with etchings
on it.
   In May 1976, Science magazine carried an article attributed to
John C. Kraft, a geologist at the University of Delaware, that the
pendant could be authentic, but one year later he told another
journal the piece might be a fraud.
   When Metzler began his investigation in 1981, he found Cresson
claimed to have found the pendant in 1864 but told no one about it
until 1889. The researcher checked newspaper microfilms that might
have clues about Cresson.
   ``When the microfilm came back, I was flabbergasted,'' Meltzer
said. According to front-page stories, Cresson ``blew his brains
out'' in a New York City park. One report quoted his suicide note as
saying he was suspected of counterfeiting and was being followed by
Secret Service agents.
   Metzler learned that Cresson had studied art and archaeology in
France about the time of the La Madeliene discovery. ``The more we
learned about Cresson, the more suspicious we got,'' he said. The
carbon dating, measuring the amount of radioactive carbon 14 left in
the pendant, was the final confirmation.

<TEXT>
   The noontime peal of church bells Thursday
implored Peruvians to interrupt their activities and pray for an end
to a vicious leftist insurgency that has bloodied Peru's landscape
and shrouded its future.
   Police and fire sirens roared and many motorists stopped their
cars and honked in Lima and other cities to usher in a ``minute of
silence for peace.''
   Thousands elsewhere in Lima froze in their tracks on downtown and
suburban streets for a moment of private reflection, but many others
others went about their business, ignoring the event.
   Officials say nearly 2,000 people have died in the leftist
insurgency of the Shining Path guerrilla group since the first
nationwide peace vigil was held exactly one year ago.
   ``Too much blood has been spilled. This is both a silent
invitation and the clamor of the multitudes. We want peace,''
Cardinal Juan Landazuri said in a nationally televised speech.
   Lima's Municipal Palace, where Landazuri spoke in a ceremony
attended by dozens of the nation's leaders, was guarded by scores of
heavily armed police, a stark reminder of the possibility of a
terror attack.
   Riot police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse a noon
march near the Municipal Palace of about 300 members of the
Confederation of State Laborers, said reporters on the scene.
   The protesters said they were marching to demand that authorities
release a confederation leader arrested three weeks ago. Police have
denied the man was detained.
   In the highland, where rebel violence has been heaviest,
Thursday's vigil passed unheeded in Ayacucho, 225 miles southeast of
Lima. But church bells rang and sirens wailed in Huancayo, 125 miles
east of Lima, witnesses said.
   The protest against terrorism came as Peru faces a severe
economic recession. Inflation is expected to hit 1,800 percent this
year.
   A recent report by the Senate's commission on violence said the
economic woes and the insurgency and repressive countermeasures by
government forces were undermining Peru's democracy.
   The commission said the roots of the insurgency are imbedded in
centuries of hatred and discrimination between Peru's rich and poor.
   Along with increasing reports of violence since October,
newspapers daily carry stories on factory shutdowns, layoffs, a
dramatic fall in public spending power and growing lines for basic
foods.
   ``Peru's general crisis brings us toward decisive years during
which our revolution will accelerate powerfully,'' the leader and
founder of the Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, said recently during
his only published interview since the fighting began.
   Guzman launched the insurgency to topple Peru's elected
government and install Marxist rule in May 1980.
   Since then, the fighting has killed more than 12,000 people and
has spread throughout the central highlands, down to the major
coastal cities and into the eastern jungle.
   Among those slain this year were one American and two French
agricultural development workers, the first foreigners known to have
been executed purposely by the guerrillas.
   To counter the guerrillas, the government has installed states of
emergency, giving the military broad policing and governing powers
in eight states where more than half of Peru's 21 million people
live.
   Both the London-based Amnesty International and the New
York-based Americas Watch sharply criticized Peruvian authorities in
reports this year for tolerating human rights violations.

   The stepped up security measures for U.S.
airliners around the world announced by the Federal Aviation
Administration on Thursday are directed primarily against one type
of bomb that has so far defied all detection methods _ plastic
explosives.
   The FAA announced it is requiring tightened security by U.S. air
carriers at 103 airports in the Middle East and Western Europe,
including X-ray or physical inspection of all checked baggage and
random physical checks of some carry-on baggage.
   Investigators sifting through the debris of Pan Am flight 103
which crashed last week in Scotland have determined that a powerful
plastic bomb blew up the giant Boeing 747, killing its 259 occupants
and 11 people on the ground.
   Attention has focused on one type of plastic explosive which has
been used in the past with frightening success by Arab terrorists _
an odorless, orange substance known as Semtex.
   ``It's a favorite with these groups because it's significantly
harder to detect than anything else, it's more powerful than other
plastics,'' said George Carver, a senior CIA analyst for many years
and now a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
   Czechoslovakia, a Communist country which has a well-developed
state-run arms and munitions industry, makes Semtex at a plant
called the Eastern Bohemian Works. U.S. State Department officials
say they have asked the Czechs to desist from production of Semtex
or at least to prevent its export.
   Recently, Czechoslovakia indicated it might be willing to stop
selling Semtex, said Neil Livingstone, who has served as a
consultant to government security and intelligence agencies and has
written seven books on international security and terrorism.
   Czechoslovakia is believed to have supplied Semtex to Syria and
Libya, said one State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The United States also makes plastic explosives for use by the
military. But those substances, known as C-4, are not available to
commercial users such as dynamiting contractors.
   Like C-4, Semtex is malleable like putty and shows up on an X-ray
operator's screen as an indistinguishable dense mass. But unlike C-4
and other known plastic bombs, Semtex is completely odorless.
   Semtex also has the advantage of being stable, meaning it cannot
go off unless it is meant to.
   Conventional X-ray machines, as well as bomb sniffing dogs, have
so far been thwarted by Semtex and C-4. But researchers have come up
with what they say is a nearly foolproof response.
   The machine goes by the name of Thermal Neutron Analysis device,
or TNA, and is about twice the size of an airport X-ray machine.
During the yearlong test in the Los Angeles and San Francisco
airports under a contract from the FAA, it demonstrated a 95 percent
detection rate with few false alarms, the agency said.
   As part of the new security measures announced Thursday, the FAA
said it is accelerating by six months the delivery of more TNAs.
Under the accelerated program, the first unit will be in operation
next summer and the last of five, perhaps six, will be operational
by the beginning of 1990.
   The agency said it had not been decided where to place the
thermal neutron equipment, which could go into airports either in
the United States or overseas or a combination of the two. Each unit
costs $750,000 to $1 million.
   According to the FAA, the device is capable of scanning a piece
of luggage in six seconds and can be adapted for use with a conveyor
system that could handle large numbers of baggage in relatively
short periods of time with a low rate of false alarms.
   Lee Grodzins, an FAA consultant, said that until now, ``there was
no impetus. There was no public demand to put them into airports.''
   But the Pan Am disaster has provided the impetus to move the TNAs
from the experimental to the operational stage.
   The FAA _ with a nudge from Congress _ stepped up its development
of bomb detection devices after a terrorist bomb apparently caused
an Air-India jumbo jet to crash off the Irish coast in l985 and a
bomb detonated aboard a Trans World Airlines jet over the
Mediterranean in 1986, killing four Americans.
   The TWA bombing was determined to have been caused by Semtex and
carried out by a Palestinian faction known as the May 15
organization.
   Semtex also was the culprit in a foiled attempt sponsored by the
Syrian government to blow up an Israeli El Al airliner at London's
Heathrow airport in 1986.

<HEAD>Embassy Charges Terrorist Groups Learned From Arafat Organization</HEAD>

   The Israeli government said Thursday that the
Palestine Liberation Organization set the examples for all terrorist
groups which attack civilian airplanes and their passengers.
   A statement titled ``PLO: The first of its kind,'' did not
directly link Yassar Arafat's group to the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103, the Boeing 747 jetliner that crashed last week in Scotland and
killed all 259 aboard and an estimated 11 people on the ground.
   But the statement, released by the Israeli embassy, said all
terrorist groups that have targeted civil aviation in recent years
``learned from one source _ the PLO.''
   Arafat's organization was the first to hijack an airplane, an El
Al fight in 1968; the first to destroy a plane in midair, a Swissair
flight to Israel in 1970; and the first to carry out a
gun-and-grenade attack on passengers, an El Al plane in Greece in
1968, the statement said.
   ``Internationalist terrorist organizations have learned from the
PLO in other areas as well,'' the embassy said. It cited the murder
of 11 Israeli athletes at the Olympics in Munich, West Germany, and
the seizure of the Israeli embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, also in
1972.
   U.S. investigators so far have been unable to pinpoint the person
or group that placed a bomb aboard the Pan Am plane. At least two
radical Palestinian organizations, both outside the PLO, are among a
wide spectrum of possible suspects. These are The Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and the Al Fatah
Revolutionary Council headed by Abu Nidal.
   ``The PLO has throughout the years develped links and cooperated,
at times very closely, with other terror organizations,'' the
Israeli statement said, ``providing them with funds, arms, training
and operational assistance.''
   In the Middle East, it said, Abu Nidal and others used terror
methods which they first learned from the PLO before breaking away
to form their own groups.
   The PLO itself ``has not ended its own campaign of terror, but
has only redefined the direction, range and tactical form of the
`armed struggle,' which is another definition of terror and violence
sanctioned by the PLO,'' the statement said. ``From earlier years to
more recent attacks, PLO violence shows that when it comes to
terrorism, the PLO wrote the book.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz accused the PLO of terrorism
last month as he denied Arafat a visa to speak to the U.N. General
Assembly in New York. He called the PLO chairman an ``accessory'' to
terrorism.
   Subsequently, Arafat said he renounced terrorism ``in all forms''
and Shultz approved U.S. talks with the PLO, the first authorized by
the United States in 13 years.
   The first session was held Dec. 16 in Carthage, Tunisia.
Afterward, Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy and other
senior Reagan administration officials cautioned the PLO the
``substantive dialogue'' would be terminated if acts of terrorism
were traced to Arafat's organization.
   There have been no U.S. accusations against the PLO since.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Soar After Devaluation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>

   Interest rates soared in Israel on Thursday as
skepticism grew over the government's decision to devalue the shekel.
   The Bank of Israel, the central bank, raised its lending rate to
banks and other large financial institutions to 48.25 percent a
year, compared to 32.8 percent a week ago.
   The rate is high because of Israel's high inflation rate.
   Bank Leumi, the nation's largest commercial bank, raised its
basic lending rate to 2 percent a month from 1.5 percent. Other
financial institutions were expected to follow suit.
   Israel radio said people are ``panicked'' and many believe
further devaluation is imminent.
   The Central Bureau of Statistics published more bad news at a
news conference Thursday.
   It estimated that Israel's gross national product _ the value of
all goods and services produced in the economy _ grew 1 percent this
year, down from 5.2 percent in 1987. Figures were adjusted for
inflation.
   Ezra Hadar, director of the bureau's national accounts division,
told reporters the slowdown reflected declines in industrial
production and agricultural output as well as side-effects from the
year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories.
   Palestinians boycotted Israeli-made products and some quit jobs
in Israel, reducing the output of industries like textiles and
construction.
   Hadar estimated the uprising cost $300 million in sales, and
cancellation of the Israeli-built Lavi fighter jet reduced sales
another $300 million.
   Israel' s unemployment rate was above 7 percent compared to 6.1
percent last year, he said.
   The government on Tuesday devalued the shekel by 5 percent in an
effort to stem a speculative buying binge of foreign currencies.
   That lowered the currency to 1.680 shekels to the dollar from
1.599.
   Purchases of foreign currencies, especially the dollar, slowed to
$70 million from $80 million on Wednesday and a record $135 million
on Tuesday, said Bank of Israel spokesman Amnon Yakobi.
   Critics say the devaluation is inflationary and badly timed,
throwing off year-end closing of corporate balance sheets.
   Business leaders believe a larger devaluation is needed next year
to bring the shekel more in line with U.S. and European currencies.
   Zvi Amit of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce said companies
with foreign currency debts have had to revalue them upward by 5
percent in shekels, reducing their profits for the year.
   ``It hurts their credit lines, it hurts their efforts to attract
investment, it hurts all around,'' Amit said.

<HEAD>Officials Using New Inspections Of Boeings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, trying to counter a wave of
negative publicity, said Thursday it will regularly use electrical
current devices to detect the tiniest of gaps in the bodies of older
Boeing 727s.
   ``We had an unfortunate incident and we are responding,'' said
Joseph B. Leonard, executive vice president, referring to Monday's
emergency landing of an Eastern Boeing 727 in Charleston, W.Va.,
with a 14-inch tear in its fuselage.
   After the incident, in which two people suffered minor injures,
the airline visually inspected the 46 oldest of its 111 727s _ those
with 30,000 or more landings.
   Ed Upton, Eastern vice president for maintenance and engineering,
said that currently, the airline inspects its planes visually. When
it suspects a crack in an obscure place, it uses electrical
detectors known as eddy-current devices.
   Upton said the devices have been recalibrated to go deeper into
the metal and detect a gap of one-130,000th of an inch, and will be
used on older Boeings on a regular basis.
   How often depends on results of the electrical inspection of the
46 oldest jets, he said.
   The rivet-to-rivet testing will be conducted on a 100-inch-long
stretch of the planes, from about the last row of seats to the rear
door. The 22-year-old plane that tore open Monday developed the hole
in the roof near the tail.
   A Boeing 727 was grounded in Boston on Monday after a three-inch
crack was discovered near the tail. On Wednesday Eastern maintenance
workers in Miami found corrosion near fuselage rivets on a 727. The
company also disclosed that cracks were found in a McDonnell Douglas
DC-9 during an unrelated, previously begun industrywide inspection
of DC-9 planes with 55,000 or more landings.
   Leonard said tiny, nonhazardous cracks are found in aircraft
every day during routine inspections.
   ``This is not an Eastern-exclusive problem. It's absolutely
consistent with the industry,'' Leonard said.
   He also said the age of the aircraft was being overemphasized and
he said a plane's age doesn't necessarily affect its safety.
   The tear on the flight Monday was from inside an overlap of
aluminum on the fuselage, ``a new twist,'' Upton said. The routine
visual inspections conducted after 1,100 landings couldn't detect
such ``inside-out'' tearing, he said.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said it will take about a
month for the electrical testing to be completed on the 46 planes.
   By then, the company would know better the cause of the tear that
forced Monday's emergency landing and will adjust its maintenance
program accordingly, she said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration will propose in January that
operators of older 727s be required to replace some rivets, agency
spokesman Dave Duff said Wednesday. Duff said it had not been
determined how many airplanes would be covered.

   Pease Air Force Base, where George Bush
arrives when he visits Maine, is one of the biggest installations
put on the chopping block Thursday, and officials hunted for ways to
soften the $340 million shock.
   News that the 33-year-old base, home to some of the country's top
bomber groups, might close as soon as January 1990 shocked many
people in the state.
   The base employs 3,700 military personnel and 500 civilians.
There also are an estimated 1,700 secondary jobs stemming from the
base, and the closing is expected to cost $340 million to the
economy within a 100-mile radius.
   Base commander Col. Orin Godsey said local officials ``were
amazed, and I don't think they expected it'' when he met with them
to break the news. ``It's like a lot of other communities in the
United States today because no one ever wants to think they will be
on the closure list.''
   The Commission on Base Realignment and Closure proposed that 34
military installations be closed. It also recommended partially
closing five other bases and reorganizing 54 more that would get new
missions and additional personnel.
   Godsey said despite the shock, local officials ``had a very
positive outlook. They're looking at ways they can make the military
base a usable installation.''
   One of the most frequently mentioned ideas was to convert the
base into a regional airport.
   The state's congressional delegation, who supported creation of
the commission, said they would not fight the closing if it is
justified.
   ``I don't want to raise false expectations about altering this
recommendation,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a conservative
Republican. ``At this juncture, it looks like a foregone conclusion
that it will close. It's highly unlikely that Congress will reject
this list.
   ``If there's a good case to be made to close Pease, so be it.
Military bases aren't forever.''
   Rep. Robert Smith, another conservative Republican, said he and
the rest of the delegation planned to meet with people in the state
to acertain their feelings. ``If they want me to fight it, I'll
fight it,'' he said.
   The commission recommended closing Pease because of a shortage of
facilities at the base and its vulnerability to sub-launched
ballistic missiles that could strike before its planes get off the
ground, the panel said.
   Pease opened in 1956 and has been home of the 509th Bombardment
Wing, whose predecessor, the 509th Composite Group of the Army Air
Corps, dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.
   In 1985 Pease was listed in the book ``Nuclear Battlefields'' as
having 190 atomic warheads, ranking New Hampshire 21st among the
states. The federal government does not acknowledge where it keeps
its nuclear weapons.
   Since its founding, Pease has been a base for B-29, B-52 and B-47
bombers. Today it deploys KC-135 refueling tankers and FB-111
fighter bombers.

   A brother of a Pan Am crewman came
seeking a Bible on Thursday from the church near the spot where the
cockpit of Flight 103 fell.
   ``I said he could take the Bibles or take anything else he
thought might help,'' said the Rev. Cameron Gibson of Tundergarth
Parish Church. ``He had free rein to take what he wanted.''
   The brother wanted to take the Bible ``to his old mother in
America as a memento of near where her son had died,'' Gibson said.
   The country church is three miles east of Lockerbie, where the
jumbo jet crashed Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and leaving
11 people on the ground missing and presumed dead.
   Investigators said the crash was caused by a bomb in the cargo
hold.
   John Wagner, brother of First Officer Raymond Wagner, 52, of
Pennington, N.J., had approached police in Lockerbie about obtaining
two prayer books.
   Gibson said there were no prayer books in the Calvinist Church of
Scotland, but that he was welcome to take King James Bibles.
   The bodies of Wagner and pilot James Bruce MacQuarrie, 55, of
Kensington, N.H., were among the first to be released this week to
next-of-kin.
   Royal Engineers using circular saws cut the nose of the plane
into sections for transport to the Air Accident Investigation
Branch's facility in Farnborough in southern England.
   The nose, still displaying the plane's designation Clipper Maid
of the Seas, is the largest piece of wreckage and one of the few
immediately recognizable as part of an aircraft.
   The engineers and members of the Royal Highland Fusiliers are
billeted in the Tundergarth church. The nose fell just beyond the
churchyard wall.
   Several relatives of the dead came to the site with flowers on
Thursday.
   Despite the disaster, the church went ahead with its Christmas
service, ``one of the most difficult I have ever had to prepare in
the 26 years of my ministry,'' Gibson said.
   ``The only thing I could possibly tell them was God was with us.''
   Gibson, like other ministers and priests in the area, has taken
on an unexpected burden of counseling grief-stricken parishioners
and relatives of the dead.
   Social workers who have also been counseling townspeople say they
have encountered some who refused to face up to the disaster.
   ``We are experiencing a typical part of the Scots' personality
which says `We don't want help,''' said Tom McMenamy, director of
the regional department of social work.
   ``People are denying the event happened at all and we have got to
make sure they don't stay like that. ...
   ``The fact it was a bomb gives them a focus for anger. They know
now how it happened, but they don't know who did it; but it is much
healthier to know how something happened.''
   It may be months before the town of 2,500 people regains its
normal appearance. John Orr, the detective who is heading a criminal
investigation based in Lockerbie, said he was prepared for a long
and painstaking operation.
   As the search continues, helicopters are frequently overhead, and
military and rescue vehicles jam the streets.
   Outside the Town Hall, being used as a temporary morgue, the pile
of flowers from relatives of the dead and from sympathizers in
several countries has grown daily.
   In private meetings arranged for residents of damaged areas,
several people have complained about being questioned by some of the
dozens of reporters on the scene, according to a local newspaper,
the Annandale Herald.
   ``There's been no Christmas in Lockerbie,'' one young man said
Wednesday night as he edged away from a camera crew. ``I don't want
to talk about it. No one wants to talk about it.''
   Leslie Jardine, a spokesman for the social work department, said
nearly $360,000 had been collected for relief work in Lockerbie.
More than half that amount came from Pan Am and its insurer.
   The local parish of the Church of Scotland is planning a memorial
service Jan. 4, and arrangements have been made to seat expected
overflow crowds in other halls and churches.
   The Rev. John Owen, a Church of Scotland minister from nearby
Lochmaben, wrote in the ``Reflections'' column of the Annandale
Herald, that there were no easy answers to the disaster.
   ``If you want truth, take your coat off and sit down. This will
take whatever time truth takes,'' he wrote.
   ``There is a time for everything, and when the time comes to
speak of other things we will. Now we need to give ourselves a time
to mourn.''

<HEAD>Child With AIDS To Get Visit From Brothers, Sisters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven-year-old AIDS victim Eliana Martinez
will be reunited with her two brothers and two sisters next week
when the siblings are flown here from Puerto Rico by the Make-A-Wish
Foundation.
   The visiting children are 8 to 12 years old and live with two
sets of adoptive parents. They will be accompanied by their mothers
and stay at a hotel for about five days, officials said.
   Eliana, who acquired AIDS through blood transfusions shortly
after her premature birth, has become widely known through her
mother's court battles to enroll her in a public school.
   School officials barred the girl from class, saying she might
transmit the AIDS virus because she is mentally impaired and not
toilet trained. A federal judge ruled Eliana could attend classes if
she were isolated in a glass booth.
   The child's adoptive mother, Rosa Martinez, fought that decision,
saying she refused to let the girl ``sit in a cage.'' A federal
appeals court has ordered hearings to determine whether the
youngster poses a health threat.
   Eliana, who speaks through sign language, may not understand that
the four children coming to visit are her biological brothers and
sisters, her mother said Wednesday.
   ``I'm going to tell her she's going to have children playing with
her,'' said Ms. Martinez. ``She doesn't know what to think of little
people. I don't even know if she realizes she is one.''
   All but the eldest of the children were taken from their parents
in Puerto Rico at birth, said Ms. Martinez, who adopted Eliana in
1982 after hearing a radio appeal for someone to take in a homeless
toddler.
   ``Their parents were the equivalent of the homeless people here.
The oldest got to live with them about three months'' but was
neglected and then placed with a welfare agency.
   Eliana's siblings know who their baby sister is from seeing her
on television and in the newspapers, said Ms. Martinez. She said
their mothers have encouraged them to write Eliana.
   The little girl was hospitalized with pneumonia and congestive
heart failure for a week in early December but has recovered, said
Ms. Martinez, who added, ``She's into everything.
   ``I just want her to have children to play with. I don't know how
she'll react,'' said Ms. Martinez. ``She's got no social skills.''
   The children and their adoptive parents are expected to arrive on
Jan. 2.
   The group plans a trip to Walt Disney World, outings to parks
``and quiet evenings at home with Eliana,'' said Ms. Martinez.
   The Make-A-Wish Foundation tries to made dreams come true for
dying children.

   A 1-year-old boy was shot and wounded in a car
driven by his babysitter through a housing complex while the woman
looked for a drug dealer, Tampa police said.
   Theresa Charlene Robertson, 30, was arrested after telling police
that the infant was shot as she struggled with a man who approached
her car and tried to rob her at gunpoint Tuesday night at the
Riverview Terrace housing complex.
   ``She has admitted to us that she drove over to that area last
night for the sole purpose of buying crack cocaine,'' police
spokesman Steve Cole said Wednesday.
   The infant, Sebastian Placker, was reported in guarded condition
at St. Joseph's Hospital. His mother, Debra Placker, 26, was on a
trip to Philadelphia and left the child with Ms. Robertson, police
said.
   Two other children in the car, Sebastian's 7-year-old brother
Jerome and a 6-month-old child belonging to another woman, were not
hurt, Cole said.
   Ms. Robertson was held on a charge of possessing four grams of
cocaine, the police spokesman said.

   Israel's deputy foreign minister on Thursday
sought to tie the PLO to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and blamed
the U.S. decision to talk to the guerrilla organization for
encouraging international terrorism.
   The statement by Binyamin Netanyahu, a leading member of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, follows repeated Israeli
criticism of the United States for including Yasser Arafat and the
Palestine Liberation Organization in the Middle East peace process.
   ``By having these kinds of talks ... you are sending a message, a
very clear message, that terrorism pays,'' Netanyahu told a news
conference. ``The American talks with the PLO have seriously
weakenened the American effort against terrorism.''
   He said suspicion in the Dec. 21 Pan Am bombing focused on groups
experienced with the type of explosives used in the blast, including
the PLO and Syria.
   However, he said he had no firm information on who was to blame
for the bombing, and an Israeli security expert said Arafat's
mainstream PLO faction was ``not a likely candidate.''
   Netanyahu's comments echoed Shamir's, who suggested Tuesday that
Washington's decision was encouraging renewed infiltration attacks
along the Israeli border. Shamir said the American move ``encouraged
the tendency of violent acts against Israel.''
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
earlier this week that a major Israeli foreign policy goal would be
to reverse Washington's decision to talk to the PLO.
   On Thursday, Netanyahu called the PLO ``the foremost practitioner
of aviation terrorism.'' It was responsible for the first airliner
hijacking, the first destruction of a passenger plane in midair and
the first gun and grenade attack on passengers, he said.
   ``I say the PLO, I mean Fatah, I mean Arafat,'' he said,
referring to the PLO chief's mainstream guerrilla group.
   Netanyahu spoke at a news conference called to announce an
international seminar on airline security in February in Tel Aviv.
The conference focused on the bombing of the Pan Am jet over
Scotland in which more than 260 people died in the air and on the
ground.
   Ariel Merari, an Israeli terrorism expert, told reporters at the
news conference that he doubted the mainstream PLO would have
carried out the attack when Arafat is making statements about peace
with Israel.
   ``I don't think the present political situation is such that the
PLO would sponsor such an attack,'' he said. ``My guess is at least
for a while they'll refrain from international terrorism because it
is politically counterproductive.''
   Merari, director of a project on terrorism at Tel Aviv
University, said earlier he believed the Pan Am attackers probably
were radical PLO factions opposed to Arafat's more moderate stands.
   He said it was such splinter groups that actually carried out the
first hijacking and first blowing up of a plane in midair, not
Arafat's Fatah.
   Israel began criticizing the United States after Secretary of
State George Shultz announced Dec. 14 that the PLO had met American
demands for inclusion in the peace process by recognizing Israel and
renouncing terrorism.
   Israel's new government included in its political program a
refusal to negotiate with the PLO, which it views as a terrorist
organization.

   Thabo Moloi, 17, had his
picture printed on the front page of The Sowetan newspaper Thursday,
the only high school student in the township of 2.5 million to
graduate with a ``B'' grade average.
   There were no ``A'' students among the 4,508 who took their final
examinations in Soweto. Only five of all South Africa's black
students had ``A'' averages.
   Nationwide, 57.4 percent of the 170,966 full-time black high
school students who wrote final exams passed, a slight improvement
over last year's 56.9 percent. In Soweto, 37.8 percent of all high
school seniors passed, an increase over last year's 32 percent.
   ``There is no reason to believe that black children are less
intelligent than whites. ... But year after year the black
matriculation results are disastrous,'' said The Sowetan in an
editorial.
   ``The sensible view surely should be to improve black education.
Blacks will outnumber whites in ever-increasing numbers as we reach
the turn of the century. Black skills will be needed with
ever-increasing desperation,'' The Sowetan said.
   In the 1950s, under legislation supporting the apartheid system
of race separation, the white government instituted an inferior
education system for blacks and prohibited them from attending
missionary and other private schools where most of today's black
leaders received their education.
   Today the government says its standards for black education are
the same as for whites. But since resources are allocated by race,
the amount of money spent on a white child's education is five times
that spent on a black.
   Black schools also have been wracked by boycotts since nationwide
unrest broke out in 1984. Although there was no boycott this year,
graduating students had years of material with which to catch up.
Another disadvantage is that many of their teachers themselves have
not passed the high school graduation examination.

   President Reagan pledged Thursday that the
United States would make ``every effort'' to discover who was
responsible for last week's bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed
259 people in the air and 11 on the ground in Scotland.
   ``Now that we know definitely that it was a bomb, we're going to
make every effort we can to find out who was guilty of this savage
and tragic thing and bring them to justice,'' Reagan said at Los
Angeles International Airport before he boarded Air Force One to
head to Palm Springs.
   Asked whether he thought the Pan Am attack was perpetrated by
terrorists, Reagan said it seemed to be, ``but we're going to have
to have more details. We're doing everything we can to find them.''
   As his wife, Nancy, stood off the side, Reagan expressed sympathy
for the families of those who died and said that whoever was
responsible for the deaths would be charged with murder.
   The Reagans were headed for the desert estate of publisher Walter
Annenberg, the former ambassador to Britain. The Reagans will remain
there until Monday, when they are to return to Los Angeles to
complete their two-week California vacation.

   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski told
Poland in a televised address that fighting inflation will be the
government's top priority next year, and he appealed to consumers
not to hoard scarce goods.
   He also noted in a Wednesday night broadcast that the country's
economic reform policy is based on competition. Some people would be
better off under the reforms, but others would lose ground, he
cautioned.
   ``We of course have to be aware of this problem. We have to put
on the agenda the problem of caring for the weakest,'' he said.
   Rakowski said the government hopes to limit inflation to 20
percent next year. However, officially published estimates have
projected an overall inflation rate of 50 percent in 1989, compared
with 60 to 70 percent in 1988.
   Incomes have outstripped available supplies. Consumer hoarding of
limited goods, such as gasoline and paper supplies, exacerbates
shortages in stores.
   Rakowski appealed to Poles to observe ``the principle of reason.''
   ``It is necessary to limit demand in our conditions,'' he said.
``I think I should ask citizens not to stock up needlessly. It
really makes no sense.''
   Rakowski was making the fifth in a series of informal TV
addresses since he became premier Sept. 27.

<HEAD>Aide says Experts Studying Provisional Palestinian Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO's official spokesman said Thursday
that a special committee of experts has started discussing possible
formation of a provisional Palestinian government.
   Spokesman Ahmed Abdul Rahman told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview that the Palestinian experts in international
law and government will report their findings to the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Executive Committee within a month.
   He said a provisional government could be expected to represent
the Palestinians at the proposed international conference on Middle
East peace.
   ``Everything depends on the outcome of the effort to form a
preparatory committee for the international conference. If all goes
well we will immediately proclaim the provisional government,'' he
said.
   The Palestinian National Council, the PLO's legislature, declared
an independent Palestinian state at its meeting in November. It
passed a resolution authorizing the Executive Committee, the PLO's
governing body, to look into the feasibility of forming a
provisional government.
   In Helsinki, Finland, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the
government has officially invited PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to
visit, a move seen by some newspapers as signalling a policy shift
toward the PLO.
   An official of the PLO information office in Helsinki, who spoke
to the AP on condition his name not be used, said Arafat accepted
the invitation and was likely to go to Finland within a month.
   But Foreign Ministry official Pertti Torstila said a formal reply
was still awaited and details had not been worked out yet.
   Israeli Embassy spokesman Ehud Eitam said the invitation ``does
not contribute to the Middle East peace process.''
   The PLO official said Arafat was expected to meet President Mauno
Koivisto, Prime Minister Harri Holkeri and Foreign Minister Kalevi
Sorsa.
   Finland has refused to officially recognize the PLO, although it
allowed the Palestinian umbrella group to establish an office in
Helsinki five years ago.
   King Hussein of Jordan meanwhile was quoted as saying in an
interview released Thursday that the U.S. decision to begin a
dialogue with the PLO was ``a good start.''
   The London-based magazine Al-Hawadeth also quoted the monarch as
saying he expects President-elect George Bush to make more headway
in the Middle East because Bush has more experience and interest in
world problems.
   ``The world is beginning to face solving the Palestinian problem,
which is the most dangerous problem. I think the world will try to
solve it through an international peace conference,'' Hussein was
quoted as saying.
   ``America during ... Bush's term will be different from America
during President Reagan's term.
   ``President Reagan did not care for the Middle East problem, he
knew little about it, but Bush I think has a good experience in
world problems.''
   The interview in Arabic was translated by the AP in Cyprus.
   In Jordan's capital of Amman Thursday, Foreign Minister Marwan
Kassem met with PLO Executive Committee members Mahmoud Abbas and
Yasser Abed-Rabboo to discuss efforts for Arab-Israeli peace, the
official Jordan news agency Petra reported.

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Yugoslav human rights
activist and dissident, Dobroslav Paraga, said he was granted a
passport to travel abroad on Thursday, eight years after his
passport was taken away from him.
   He told The Associated Press the passport was delivered to him in
this Slovenian capital following his 16-day hunger strike and
appeals by Yugoslav intellectuals, including Cardinal Franjo
Kuharic, head of the Roman Catholic Church of Croatia.
   The last time Paraga requested the passport was when West German
President Richard von Weizsaecker invited him to attend a Dec. 12
meeting in Bonn organized by Amnesty International to mark the 40th
anniversary of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights.
   Asked about his travel plans, Paraga said in his telephone
interview: ``Now that I missed the meeting with Weizsaecker, I have
no other invitation or financial means to travel abroad.''
   He was arrested in 1980 and sentenced to four years' imprisonment
for collecting signatures on a petition calling for authorities to
free political prisoners.
   After his release, he published an account of his prison
experiences in which he claimed political offenders routinely are
mistreated by prison guards.
   In April 1987, he received a 6-month suspended sentence on
charges of spreading false information about treatment of political
prisoners.
   Paraga said his brother Domagoj has not yet received a passport
taken away when Paraga was arrested eight years ago.
   ``Hundreds of former political prisoners are still being denied
that right,'' he said.
   In an apparent easing of restraints, Yugoslavia's collective
federal presidency on Tuesday granted amnesty to 25 prisoners jailed
for political offenses.
   Tanjug, the state news agency, said 68 such prisoners were freed
this year.
   The vast majority of Yugoslavs routinely get passports and are
free to travel abroad.

   Rescuers plucked five seamen from 25-foot swells in
the stormy North Atlantic on Thursday, but one was dead and another
died and six others were missing after their 254-foot ship sank, the
Coast Guard said.
   The ship Lloyd Bermuda sank Wednesday night 160 miles south of
Nantucket and 200 miles east of New Jersey when its cargo shifted in
weather that was ``nothing short of horrendous,'' said Coast Guard
spokesman Lt. Paul Wolf.
   ``The last of the crew to get off said they watched the ship
sink,'' Wolf said.
   Rescuers searching for survivors were hindered by heavy rains, 40
to 45 mph winds and 25-foot seas, the Coast Guard said.
   At first light Thursday, a Navy pilot spotted what he thought was
a man waving from a life raft, but when rescuers reached the raft
they found nobody on board, Wolf said.
   Three hours later, rescuers spotted another man but, because of
choppy seas and floating debris, could not get close enough to tell
if he was alive. By the time a rescue helicopter reached him four
hours later, the man was floating face down, Coast Guard Petty
Officer Brandy Ian said.
   His body was recovered and taken to Nantucket Island for
post-mortem examination by a state medical examiner.
   The container ship was one of the three main vessels that bring
food and other supplies to Bermuda, said Ian Clark, harbor master in
Hamilton, Bermuda.
   The captain of the ship was American and the crew was a mix of
nationalities, John W. Moore of the Meyer Agencies Ltd., the ship's
agent in Bermuda, said in a telephone interview from Hamilton.
   The Lloyd Bermuda, registered in Cyprus, made a run to Bermuda
every week, and had left Port Elizabeth, N.J., Tuesday night, Moore
said.
   The Rev. Barbara Crafton, an Episcopal priest at the Seamen's
Church Institute Center in Port Newark, N.J., who spent Christmas
with the men before their ship departed, said most were from Central
America and the Philippines.
   Wolf said crew members told him they abandoned ship in two
lifeboats, but only one was recovered.
   Shortly after midnight Wednesday a Coast Guard jet spotted three
people in the water waving flashlights. Rescuers aboard the merchant
ship Eagle were able to pull two from the water about 1:45 a.m. but
the third ``slipped from his life jacket, fell back into the water
and was not seen again by his rescuers,'' Wolf said.
   The two men were treated for mild hypothermia but were otherwise
unharmed. Their identies were not released.
   About 4 a.m., Coast Guard frogmen rescued two more men drifting
in the water without life rafts. They were flown by helicopter to
Falmouth Hospital, but one, who was not identified, was pronounced
dead on arrival, apparently of hypothermia, or loss of body heat, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   The other man, Dario Macio-Lopez, 35, was in fair condition and
was being treated for hypothermia, spokeswoman Marie Johnson said.

<HEAD>Weapons Linked to Man Held in Palme Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have seized several large-caliber
pistols that could be linked to a suspect accused of killing Prime
Minister Olof Palme, the Dagens Nyheter newspaper reported Thursday.
   The murder weapon has been a key piece of missing evidence in the
nearly 3-year-old case.
   The paper quoted Chief Detective Hans Olvebro as saying a number
of weapons were test-fired to compare the slugs with those found at
the scene of the assassination. Only some were ruled out as the
murder weapon, he said.
   Christer Pettersson, 41, the man arrested on Dec. 14, could have
had access to the pistols, Dagens Nyheter said.
   Pettersson, who has a long history of violent crime and of drug
and alcohol abuse, was to remain in custody until Friday.
Prosecutors said they will seek an extension from the courts.
   Several witnesses reportedly have identified Pettersson, with
varying degrees of certainty, as being at the scene when Palme was
shot while walking home with his wife Lisbet from a Stockholm movie
theater on Feb. 28, 1986. Mrs. Palme is the key witness.
   Two bullets were found at the scene, but a massive search failed
to turn up the weapon itself.

   An inmate who says the state is turning
prisoners into TV addicts failed in a bid to have televisions banned
behind bars.
   ``Wisconsin prisons are chock-full of inmates who are completely
addicted to television, soap operas and all,'' Adrian Lomax, an
inmate at an Oshkosh prison, said in a letter to The Milwaukee
Journal. ``Most male inmates spend almost all their free time
watching television.''
   Without television, inmates would be more likely to better
themselves and ``develop the tools necessary to become productive
members of society,'' he said.
   Warden Don Gudmanson rejected the complaint filed Nov. 7, and an
appeal to the state health and social services secretary also
failed. Gudmanson said television has a pacifying influence and
gives inmates something to do in their idle time.
   ``I don't think the inmates are any more addicted to TV than
anyone else in the community. I think watching television is a
healthy release,'' Gudmanson said Thursday. ``I don't know of any
prison in the country that doesn't allow personal televisions.''
   About 40 percent of the 400 inmates at Oshkosh have personal TV
sets, which are permitted as long as the screen is no larger than 13
inches and speakers are disconnected and headphones used. TV sets
are also in the prison day rooms.
   Lomax, who is serving a life sentence for murder, taught himself
Spanish while behind bars, and his prison job is translating prison
manuals into Spanish for Hispanic inmates. He had predicted his
request would not get far.
   A frequent filer of inmate complaints, Lomax has three others
pending, but officials said they are kept confidential unless
revealed by the inmate.
   ``He's come up with a lot of good ideas, but he's come up with
some bad ones, too,'' Gudmanson said.

   Predictions ranged from economic disaster to inconvenience as
communities speculated Thursday on how they would be affected by a
federal commission's recommendation to close or reorganize 145
military installations.
   For towns whose military bases were spared or even slated to
expand, the commission's report brought unalloyed relief.
   The commission called for closing 34 installations, partially
closing five others and reorganizing 54 others that would get new
missions and additional personnel. The panel said the measures would
save $5.6 billion over 20 years.
   California was the state most affected by the Commission on Base
Realignment and Closure report, which recommended that six
installations be shut: Norton, George and Mather air force bases,
the Presidio Army Base, Hamilton Army Air Field and the Salton Sea
Test Base.
   Plans to build Hunter's Point Naval Station at San Francisco also
would be scrapped if the panel's report is approved by Congress.
   ``The closure of Mather will certainly have an adverse economic
impact on our community,'' said Paul Salemi, a Sacramento
Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce official. ``If you look at an
industry that employs close to 7,000 people and has a payroll of
$154 million, what else can you say?''
   The shutdown of George, an air base in the desert 70 miles
northeast of Los Angeles, would signal hard times for the
surrounding communities, where the base contributes an estimated
$516 million to the economy, said U.S. Rep. Jerry Lewis.
   ``I would dread the fiscal impact it would have on the entire
high desert,'' said Adelanto City Administrator Pat Chamberlaine.
   ``We just won't survive,'' said Anita Hilton, a longtime employee
of Wright Cleaners, an establishment adjacent to Fort Dix, N.J.,
that advertises ``3 Hour Service For Fatigues And Khakis.''
   ``More than 95 percent of our business is Army. If they cut back
Fort Dix, we'll all be looking for new jobs,'' she said.
   Similar sentiments echoed through Wrightstown's four-block
downtown strip, which begins at the Fort Dix boundary and includes
several bars, a tatoo parlor, fast food restaurants, a store called
GI Joe's and a barber shop that advertises military haircuts. The
area also has a high school that is being expanded at a cost of $16
million to serve military families, school board President Thomas
Bridge said.
   New York City, which has three military installations within its
city limits, would lose one, a largely administrative naval station
in Brooklyn, but personnel would simply move to a new base on Staten
Island 20 miles away.
   ``On balance it could have been a lot worse,'' said Rep. Guy
Molinari, a Republican whose district includes the Staten Island
port.
   For some, effects of a facility closing were impossible to
predict.
   ``We've never been through one of these,'' said Col. Walt Siders,
a spokesman for the Arizona National Guard, which operates the
Navajo Army Depot slated for closing. ``It came as a complete
surprise when we heard about it on the radio this morning.''
   Salt Lake City Mayor Palmer DePaulis said he wasn't surprised the
commission recommended closing historic Fort Douglas, built in 1862
to protect stagecoach travelers and keep watch on Mormon settlers.
   It had long been criticized as contributing little to the
nation's defense.
   He said the fort, with 44 buildings registered as national
historic landmarks, would ``be perfect for an Olympic village'' if
the city is selected as host of the 1998 Winter Olympic Games.
   For many the states, the commission news was a mix of good and
bad.
   In Massachusetts, officials and merchants in Ayer were relieved
that the Fort Devens Army Base escaped the budget ax, but Watertown
residents lamented the passing of an Army facility that has been a
neighbor since the War of 1812.
   The Army Materials Technology Laboratory in Watertown, which
oversees development of metals and other materials for use in
weapons, armor, bridges and military structures, had long been
rumored to be on the verge of closing.
   Harold Laye, an employee since 1956, said workers regarded former
House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill to be the lab's protector.
O'Neill retired two years ago. ``We knew it was coming,'' Laye said.
``It's a sad day.''
   Ayers residents found that Fort Devens, also mentioned as a
candidate for closing, was instead recommended for enlargement. ``I
think we ought to be celebrating today,'' said Ed Kelley, owner of a
card shop and a director of the chamber of commerce. ``It's the best
news we could have for a New Years.''
   In Virginia, Cameron Station in Alexandria and the Defense
Mapping Agency in Herndon were recommended for closing, but state
leaders were relieved that four larger bases considered vulnerable
were untouched: Fort Monroe in Hampton, Fort Pickett in Blackstone,
Fort Lee in Petersburg and Vint Hill Farms near Warrenton.
   Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County was recommended for a major
expansion.
   ``I am extremely happy,'' said Arlene Crittenden, a dress shop
owner in Hampton Roads who had led efforts to save nearby Fort
Monroe. ``I don't even care if I sell a dress today.'' She said
community leaders would go ahead with plans for a party Thursday
night to celebrate the fort's survival.

<TEXT>
   A windy and sometimes wet day in the West kept people indoors
Thursday, while freezing temperatures did the trick along the
nation's northern tier.
   A cold front brought rain to the Pacific Northwest, especially
along the coast, and warnings of freezing rain and snow were posted
inland. At Astoria, Ore., more than an inch and a quarter of rain
fell in six hours Thursday morning.
   In the mountains of northern California and western Nevada, a
winter storm watch was posted for Friday, in anticipation of up to 2
feet of new snow.
   Farther east, high winds buffeted the eastern slopes of the
Rockies in Montana and Wyoming. Wind gusts greater than 80 mph were
reported in southeastern Wyoming's Curt Gowdy State Park near
Cheyenne.
   In southern California, gusty Santa Ana winds howled again, with
advisories posted for mountain areas in the northern part of the
region and along the canyons east of Los Angeles.
   Unseasonably cold weather chilled the Southwest as half a dozen
cities reported record low temperatures for the date, including
Tucson, Ariz., where the 20-degree reading broke the record of 23
set in 1966. A freeze warning was posted for part of the Arizona
desert.
   Icy temperatures gripped the northern United States from New
England and the Ohio Valley across the Great Lakes region and middle
and upper Mississippi Valley to the northern and central Plains.
Afternoon readings were in the single digits or below zero across
much of the area from eastern Montana to Wisconsin and Michigan's
Upper Peninsula.
   The warm spots were Texas' lower Rio Grande Valley, where it was
in the 60s, and the Florida Peninsula, where it was generally in the
60s and 70s.
   Snow showers dampened the Great Lakes area, while skies were
sunny from the Southwest to the central Plains. Partly cloudy to
cloudy skies prevailed elsewhere.
   The overnight low for the nation was 33 degrees below zero at
Hibbing, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees below zero at Ely and International Falls, both in
Minnesota, to 83 degrees at Sanford, Fla.
   On Friday, rain and snow were expected to spread from the
northern and central Pacific coast to the northern Rockies, with
heavy snow possible at higher elevations. Light snow was forecast
for the north-central states and the Great Lakes region. Showers and
thunderstorms were predicted from southern Texas and the central
Gulf coast into the lower Mississippi Valley, with scattered rain
and snow showers north along the river valley into the Ohio Valley.
Elsewhere, it will be fair to partly sunny.
   Temperatures were expected to stay below 32 degrees throughout
the day from the northern Plateau and central Rockies through the
Dakotas and much of the Great Lakes to northern New England. The
forecast called for temperatures to rise into the 50s and low 60s
from the central coast of California to southern Arizona and from
the Rio Grande Valley to the southern Atlantic coast, but reach the
70s and low 80s in Florida.

<HEAD>Agency Says 1988 Pontiac LeMans Seat Belt Buckles May Be Defective</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you own a 1988 Pontiac LeMans, your seat
belt buckles may be defective and should be replaced, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday.
   LeMans owners should contact their dealers to have the buckles
replaced ``as soon as possible,'' NHTSA administrator Diane K. Steed
said in a statement.
   There will be no charge for the replacements.
   ``To our knowledge, no one has yet been injured, but the
potential exists for safety belt failure at the worst possible
moment,'' said Steed.
   On Dec. 9, General Motors recalled about 85,000 of the cars to
replace the defective buckles because they may appear to be latched
when they are not.
   NHTSA said 46 percent of Americans use safety belts, and the
devices saved about 4,000 lives in 1987.

   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Thursday it is requiring tightened security by U.S. air carriers at
103 airports in the Middle East and Western Europe, including X-ray
or physical inspection of all checked baggage and random physical
checks of some carry-on baggage.
   The new measures, coming in the wake of the Dec. 21 bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 which killed all 259 people on board and 11 people
on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland, will be effective within 48
hours and ``far exceed existing international standards,'' said FAA
Administrator T. Allan McArtor.
   Many of the new measures already are being followed, but until
now had not been required all the time, he said.
   The new measures ``may well result in passenger delays and
inconvenience,'' McArtor said, adding that they could mean
``check-in earlier, perhaps as much as an hour.''
   McArtor said he was ``not at liberty'' to discuss how passengers
would be selected for random inspection of hand-baggage or what
proportion would be chosen for those inspections.
   Asked why similar measures were not being required at U.S.
airports, McArtor told a news conference, ``The threat appears to be
more international in scope. We are encouraging our carriers to be
more vigilant domestically.''
   In addition to the 100 percent inspection of checked baggage and
the random inspection of carry-on baggage, here are the main points
of the FAA's new program:
   _Passengers may not have access to checked baggage after it has
cleared security.
   _Airlines must ``perform positive match'' of passenger and
baggage to keep unaccompanied bags off the plane. Asked what would
happen if a passenger boarded a plane in Frankfurt with a ticket to
New York but departed the plane at a stop in London, Ray Salazar,
director of the FAA's office of civil aviation, said that person's
baggage would have to be removed from the plane in London in
accordance with the already required ``reconciliation at the
transfer gate'' of the passenger and baggage manifests.
   _Additional measures will be required to preclude unauthorized
access to baggage. McArtor did not say what these additional
measures would be.
   _Parcels shipped through passenger ticket counters also must be
X-rayed or physically examined.
   _The FAA is accelerating by six months the delivery of thermal
neutron analysis devices which are capable of detecting all known
explosives, even those that are transparent to X-rays such as the
plastic explosives favored by terrorists. Under the accelerated
program, the first unit will be in operation next summer and the
last of five, perhaps six, will be operational by the beginning of
1990.
   McArtor said it had not been decided where to place the thermal
neutron equipment, which could go into airports either in the United
States or overseas or a combination of the two. Each unit costs
$750,000 to $1 million.
   _The agency's security inspection staff will be increased by 22
percent, from 550 people to 670, over the next 20 months.
   The FAA had not computed any estimates of additional costs to the
airlines for the tightened security arrangements, said agency
spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane.
   Stephen Hayes, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an
organization of the major U.S. air carriers, said the airline
industry will comply fully with the new security initiatives.
   ``However, more must be done than simply placing additional
security requirements on the airlines,'' Hayes said. ``The
government itself must become more directly involved in meeting the
threat that international terrorism presents.
   ``We believe the FAA should assign more of its security personnel
to Europe and the Middle East. And we believe the FAA should impose
the same security requirements on foreign airlines which serve the
United States as it imposes on U.S. airlines,'' he said.
   McArtor said the new measures overlap and duplicate to a certain
extent precautions ordered by the British authorities at Heathrow
Airport near London that took effect Thursday, and ``are quite
similar to the procedures of El Al ... the best in the world.''
   El Al is the Israeli national carrier known for its rigorous
security precautions. It has never suffered a midair explosion.
   In April 1986, an Arab terrorist gave his unsuspecting girlfriend
a bomb to carry onto an El Al jetliner bound from London to Israel.
The plastic explosive was discovered by an Israeli security guard at
Heathrow.
   Ms. Sloane, the FAA spokeswoman, said the FAA did not anticipate
imposing any additional training requirements for security personnel
hired by U.S. airlines, domestically or overseas.

   Hollis Day gave his daughter an extra warm
hug the last morning of her Christmas visit and told her he would
watch her 2-year-old handicapped son, Dylan, while she packed for
the trip home.
   The 75-year-old man then drove off with his only grandson,
leaving a note that said only: ``Gramps and Dylan have gone bye-bye
together.''
   On Thursday, two days later, Hollis Day and his grandson were
found shot to death in a locked vehicle on wooded, family-owned land
50 miles away, Sheriff Bill Logan said. The gun was near the bodies.
Both were shot in the head.
   ``At this point, the evidence appears consistent with a
homicide-suicide theory,'' Logan said. Autopsies were scheduled for
Friday.
   Debbie Day said she had realized a few hours after her father
left with Dylan that he may have been saying goodbye forever. ``He
told me what a wonderful girl and mother I was,'' she said of the
exchange Tuesday.
   Ms. Day, 40, said she called police a few hours after her father
left.
   ``It's hard to believe he would hurt anybody, much less his
grandson, but he'd written me a number of letters, talking about
dreams he'd had about flying with Dylan into the hereafter,'' Ms.
Day said. ``He had a hard time with the fact the boy was such a
burden to me.
   ``He wasn't a burden to me because I love him, but he wanted me
to be free of this responsibility, which was all-consuming.''
   Day had tried to give his daughter some time off, most recently
offering to hire a nurse or a nanny for the boy while she went on a
Hawaiian vacation.
   Dylan was developmentally disabled, his mother said. He couldn't
walk or talk, and the right side of his body was limp because of
palsy. Hollis Day was scheduled for cataract surgery Thursday and
was anxious about his own future, she said.
   ``Dad was going to watch my little boy for a few minutes while I
packed'' to return home to Portland, Ore., with Dylan and his
father, Al Berreth, said Ms. Day. They had been visiting her father,
the retired president of a clothing company, and his wife, Uwarda,
for Christmas.
   Instead of watching Dylan, Day bundled the pajama-clad boy in a
coat and hat, loaded the tot into his Jeep Wagoneer and took off.
   ``My son was beginning to talk. He was doing just fine,'' said
Ms. Day, who said Dylan was in a hospital therapy program.
   ``He was a gregarious, outgoing, happy, loving, affectionate
child. He was a beautiful child. He had all the support and love of
both parents and all of his family members,'' she said.
   Ms. Day said she believes her father was trying to help.
   ``He was the kind of person who didn't want to be burdened in his
own life and didn't want me to be burdened by my child,'' Ms. Day
said.
   ``When you have a handicapped child they're a little bit more
work and he thought that having a child like that would be a total
altering of my lifestyle that he didn't want to see imposed upon a
daughter that he loved dearly. But it wasn't in my wildest dreams
that he'd do this.''
   After Ms. Day called police, law enforcement authorities
statewide were alerted. Logan said a family member called his office
Wednesday and asked for a search of the family property near
Packwood in the Cascade Mountains.
   ``It was definitely premeditated,'' Ms. Day said before the pair
was found. ``He had the car all warmed up and ready to go so he
could sneak my little boy out of the house.''

<HEAD>Libyan Ambassador Predicts Better Ties with Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Libyan ambassador to Tunisia was quoted
Thursday as saying George Bush's administration may usher in better
relations between America and Libya, which are at odds over
terrorism and chemical warfare.
   The weekly magazine Realites quoted Ambassador Abdelati Laabidi
as saying in an interview that Libyan-U.S. relations may soon ``make
a slight improvement'' with Bush as president.
   Libya was ``ready for any dialogue which will succeed in opening
up better relations with Washington,'' the magazine quoted him as
saying.
   It said Laabidi repeated Libyan denials of U.S. charges that a
remote desert factory is producing chemical arms and insisted the
factory makes only medicines.
   President Reagan has threatened military action against the plant.
   The ambassador said Tunisia might eventually help mediate the
dispute, according to Realites.
   The ambassador also was quoted as saying Libya did not support
terrorism but ``would not stop at anything to support the just
causes of Palestine, Namibia, etc.''
   Separate guerrilla groups have been fighting to establish a
Palestinian state and to win independence for South African-ruled
Namibia. A U.N.-brokered accord providing for Namibian independence
was signed this month.
   The United States bombed Libya in 1986 for terrorism it blamed on
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   This week, suspicion fell on Libya when British authorities
announced that Pan Am Flight 103 crashed on Dec. 21 because of a
bomb explosion.
   Terrorism specialists said Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary
Council, a Palestinian guerrilla group allied with Libya, may have
planted the explosive.
   Other possible culprits mentioned included professional assassins
recruited by Libya or Syria.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen people, including six current or former
police officers, were indicted Thursday on 1,500 charges in an
alleged towing scam that bilked at least 600 people from 1982 to
1987, authorities said.
   Sgt. William H. Kelley Jr., 51, head of the Boston police auto
theft unit, was charged with six counts of conspiracy, perjury and
writing a false police report, according to indictments returned by
a Suffolk County grand jury.
   The suspects allegedly participated in several schemes to tow
legally and illegally parked cars and overcharge owners who
retrieved them, said David Rodman, a spokesman for Suffolk County
District Attorney Newman Flanagan.
   ``I was very disturbed by the arrogance and disrespectful
attitude that some police officers had _ a total disregard for the
public trust,'' Boston Police Commissioner Francis X. Roache said.
``It really sickens me.''
   Also indicted were three other Boston police officers, one
Metropolitan District Commission police officer, one former Boston
police captain, two employees of the city's abandoned car division,
two former inspectors at the state Registry of Motor Vehicles, a
special agent with the National Auto Theft Bureau and the owners of
two city garages.
   The defendants face charges ranging from larceny to concealing
stolen motor vehicles to perjury, conspiracy and insurance fraud,
according to the indictments.
   Kelley and Officer William R. Cantin, 40, who was indicted on 535
charges, have been suspended without pay, Boston police spokesman
Jim Jordan said.
   Two other indicted officers, Peter Doherty, 47, and John Ulrich,
44, were put on administrative leave guns pending a departmental
hearing, Jordan said.
   The indictments cap a two-year investigation by the Suffolk
County district attorney's office with help from the Boston Police
Anti-Corruption Unit, the MDC police and other law enforcement
agencies, officials said.
   Rodman said one alleged scheme profited from different charges
levied on cars towed by the Boston police and those towed by the
Registry of Motor Vehicles, which charges more to retrieve cars,
Rodman said.
   He said Boston police would tow a car that was parked illegally
but the defendants would tell the owner the car had been towed by
the registry.
   Another scheme, Rodman said, would be to tow a legally parked car
and wait several weeks after the owner reported it stolen to collect
daily storage charges, often as much as $600.
   He said the scheme affected at least 600 people. The indictment
does not say how much money was lost in the alleged schemes.

<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court, citing the
need for ``commercial stability,'' on Thursday limited the right of
wrongfully fired employees to collect big damage awards.
   The ruling by the conservative-dominated court moved away from
the course the California judiciary has taken since 1980, when a
court then controlled by liberals led the nation in restricting an
employer's right to fire at will.
   The court ruled 4-3 that a worker who is fired without good
cause, in violation of a company's express or implied promise, can
sue only for reinstatement and back pay, not for emotional distress
and punitive damages.
   ``Initially, predictability of the consequences of actions
related to employment contracts is important to commercial
stability,'' wrote Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas in the majority
decision.
   ``In order to achieve such stability, it is also important that
employers not be unduly deprived of discretion to dismiss an
employee by the fear that doing so will give rise to potential tort
recovery (for additional damages) in every case,'' the opinion said.
   The court allowed employees to seek additional damages when their
firings involved violations of public policy, such as a worker's
refusal to break a law.
   Justice Allen Broussard, who wrote one of three dissenting
opinions, accused the majority of ``a radical attempt to rewrite
California law'' in a way that will leave wrongfully fired workers
without adequate relief.
   ``This court is only concerned with stability of the corporation
and not the slightest bit with stability of everyday working
people,'' said Cliff Palefsky, a lawyer for employees and labor
unions.
   Victor Schachter, an employers' attorney, said the ruling
``provides a welcome bridle to unwarranted and costly termination
claims.''
   The ruling reinstates but sharply limits a suit by Daniel Foley,
who was fired from his $56,164-a-year job as Los Angeles branch
manager of Interactive Data Corp. in 1983, after telling the company
that his boss was being investigated by the FBI for embezzlement
from a former employer.
   Lucas said Foley could sue only on the grounds that his
encouraging treatment during nearly seven years of employment may
have amounted to a promise that he wouldn't be fired without good
cause.
   Under Thursday's ruling, his damages would be limited to lost pay.
   Since the court's 1980 ruling allowing wrongful-termination
suits, more than 40 other states have allowed some types of claims
by fired workers.
   But few have gone as far as California appellate court rulings
allowing emotional distress and punitive damages for workers
wrongfully fired.
   Those rulings were repudiated by the court majority Thursday.
   Most plaintiffs are managerial employees; union members generally
cannot sue, but must seek reinstatement through their labor
contracts.
   About 1,000 wrongful-termination suits were filed statewide in
1986; studies have shown employees winning about two-thirds of the
cases that go to trial, with damages averaging $177,000 for 120
winning plaintiffs in a 1980-86 Rand Corp. survey.

   Airline reservations and ticket sales indicate
travelers have been undeterred by the bombing last week of Pan Am
Flight 103, the carriers said Thursday.
   Spokesmen for TWA, British Airways and Pan Am said there has been
no appreciable change in ticket sales, reservations or telephone
inquiries.
   ``Business is normal,'' said Margie Vodopia, a spokeswoman for
British Airways. ``The airline has just come out of what is
traditionally our busy holiday period and business was normal and we
are entering what is traditionally a slower time, and it has been
business as usual for that time too.''
   ``We have not seen any effect,'' TWA spokesman Robert Blattner
agreed.
   ``This is of course a quiet period,'' said Pan Am spokesman Jeff
Kriendler, ``and we see no effect on future bookings.''
   Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that
while there was no evident change in business during the
post-holiday season, he wonders about long-range consequences,
particularly for summer vacationers who are more sensitive to safety
and economic concerns.
   ``My guess is that summer '89 travel will not be as good as
summer '88 because of those two factors, the weaker dollar and fear
of terrorism,'' Murphy said.
   While the fear of terrorism might deter some discretionary
travelers and cause some business travelers to switch to
European-based airlines, Murphy said growing fears of poor
maintenance and old aircraft might have an even bigger impact on the
airline industry.
   ``In a way, it was good news that it was a bomb and not metal
fatigue, because if it was metal fatigue, people really wouldn't
trust the rest of the fleet,'' Murphy said.
   Travel agents say some flyers have voiced concerns about aging
jetliners, but not enough to cause cancellations.
   ``I was booking someone today on Eastern to Lima (Peru) and their
only question was: `How old is the airplane?' But they still
booked,'' Iris Carroll, vice president of Adventure Travel in
Pompano Beach, Fla., said Thursday.
   ``Sophisticated clients know these things happen and that they
have no control over it,'' said Jack Bloch, president of JB's World
Travel in New York. ``If they were afraid, they couldn't travel.''
   It's the infrequent, leisure flyer who is most susceptible to
post-crash jitters, Bloch said.
   ``It's an immediate reaction, but if nothing happens in the next
month or two, they'll forget about it, which they always do,'' he
said.

   Yugoslavia may have to declare a
moratorium on foreign debt payments after parliament refused to pass
a law the IMF demanded for continued financial support, a newspaper
said Thursday.
   The major Yugoslav Communist Party daily Borba quoted an
unidentified Cabinet minister as saying the government should resign
as a result.
   It said parliament on Wednesday voted against a government
austerity law to limit wages in hard-pressed public services such as
health and education.
   Deputies defied warnings from Premier Branko Mikulic of
``Yugoslavia's obligations to the International Monetary Fund,'' the
newspaper said.
   Mikulic reportedly said the IMF insisted on the law before
agreeing in June to grant Yugoslavia a one-year standby credit of
$416 million.
   About $260 million of that credit already has been used,
according to official statistics.
   Parliament's decision ``destroys the standby arrangement with the
IMF, which in turn carries a series of other consequences,'' Borba
quoted the Cabinet minister as saying. ``After this, the government,
if it is intelligent enough, should submit its resignation,'' it
quoted the minister as saying.
   The Mikulic government faces widespread public calls to resign or
be swiftly replaced because of its inability to resolve Yugoslavia's
economic and social crisis.
   It is standard practice for the IMF to insist on curbing public
spending in inflation-ridden countries to reduce the rate of price
increases.
   With unemployment at 15 percent and inflation around 250 percent,
the standby loan was designed to help Yugoslavia meet payments on
its $21 billion foreign debt and reach agreements on loan
rescheduling with Western creditors.
   Western commercial banks and governments usually follow the IMF's
lead in judging whether to continue supporting a debtor country.
   The Cabinet minister was quoted as saying parliament's decision
``could endanger the rescheduling of $1.6 billion of Yugoslavia's
foreign debt falling due next year,'' which had been agreed
tentatively with foreign creditors.
   ``If that should happen, according to preliminary estimates, the
gross national product would decrease next year by eight percent,
thus presenting us with the possibility of declaring a moratorium,''
the Cabinet minister reportedly said.
   Borba said the Cabinet convened an emergency session immediately
after the vote late Wednesday ``to discuss the resulting
situation.'' The closed meeting published no statement by Thursday.
   Meanwhile, thousands of workers in different parts of the country
were reported on strike Thursday, protesting low wages and living
standards that officially have dropped to mid-1960s levels.

   President-elect Bush, expressing ``horror''
that a U.S. jetliner was downed by a bomb, said Thursday he would
``seek hard and punish firmly'' those responsible, if they can be
found.
   But Bush said it would be ``imprudent'' for him or any other
official to discuss ``what kind of action can be taken'' to
retaliate against terrorists.
   Bush, who has been secluded at a 10,000-acre south Texas ranch
hunting quail for three days, said he had no other information than
what was in the ``public domain'' about the bomb that blew up a Pan
American jetliner over Scotland last week. The crash killed 259
passengers and crew members and 11 people on the ground.
   The vice president made his comments as he left Chase Naval Air
Station in Beeville, Texas, headed for Pintala, about 15 miles from
Montgomery.
   Bush spent a few hours here fishing for bass on a private 55-acre
lake owned by Ray Scott, head of the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society
and founder of Bassmasters.
   ``Oh-oh ... real trouble,'' the president-elect said as he
snagged a tree by mistake. But, casting from the back of a boat, he
caught a two-pound fish a few minutes later.
   Bush caught nine fish by the end of the day, the largest of which
weighed three pounds, and he threw them all back, said Bush's
spokesman, Steve Hart.
   The president-elect arrived back to Washington in the evening.
   Asked about the British investigators' conclusion that a bomb
destroyed the Pan Am jumbo jet, Bush said he felt ``horror'' at the
finding.
   Pressed by reporters on what action should be taken, he
responded, ``Seek hard and punish firmly, decisively those who did
this, if you can ever find them.'' He added: ``When I say punish
severely, that's what I mean.''
   Despite his tough rhetoric, Bush acknowledged that stopping
terrorism was virtually impossible.
   ``When you're dealing with something as cowardly as that it's
almost impossible to guarantee there will never be another terrorism
act,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, we've seen that happen several
times.''
   To stop terrorist acts, officials need to ``continue and step up
'' anti-terrorism policies, including improved intelligence and
heightened worldwide awareness to the problem, Bush said.
   As vice president, Bush headed a presidential task force on
terrorism, and he referred to that role Thursday.
   ``We have a fine anti-terrorism policy,'' he said. ``I take great
pride in having coordinated ... the anti-terrorism report and
setting high standards for people around the world,'' he said.
   At Chase Naval Air Station, Bush took a few minutes to mount a
restored TBM Avenger, a torpedo bomber like the one he flew on World
War II missions over the Pacific.
   Clutching a white marking pen, he signed and underlined his
wife's name, Barbara, just below the cockpit. He then wrote,
``George Bush.''
   All of Bush's planes during were named for the vice president's
then-fiancee, Barbara Pierce. The plane will be transported to the
Corpus Christi, Texas, Naval Air Station for display.
   Attending the ceremony was Leo Nadeau of San Diego, Bush's
regular tail gunner on bombing missions. Nadeau's name and that of
his wife, Ginny, also were written on the plane.
   Bush said his annual hunting trip was enjoyable, particularly the
exercise from walking. The shooting wasn't up to past years, though.
   ``The drought, I think, caught up with the quail this year.'' The
hunting party shot about 10 birds a day instead of the usual 30 to
40, he said.
   While Bush enjoys most outdoor sports, he said fishing is his
favorite.
   In fact, Hart said the vice president planned another two-day
fishing trip to Florida before the Jan. 20 inauguration, possibly
over the Martin Luther King Birthday holiday.
   The next trip will be to Islamorada in the Florida Keys, about 75
miles south of Miami.
   During this stay at the Lazy F Ranch, Bush said he and his fellow
hunter and nominee for secretary of state, James Baker III,
discussed some ``personnel matter'' as well as policies after Bush
is sworn in.
   In Washington, Bush said he will ``finish the Cabinet, start
fleshing out the (deputy) secretary and undersecretary levels and,
most important, formulating definitive plans for the first 100
days.''
   He said he is ``fairly close'' to naming an energy secretary and
a drug czar, the two Cabinet-level posts that remain vacant.
   Bush said he didn't know if he would make any personnel
announcements Friday, but his aides indicated that was a possibility.

<HEAD>$250,000 Bail for Alleged Drunken Driver Unlicensed Since 1983</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POMONA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man with 10 drunken driving convictions
who lost his license for the offense in 1983 had his bail set at
$250,000 Thursday in a new drunken driving case.
   The bail for William Raymond Hilbert, 43, of Pomona was raised
from $15,000 at the request of a deputy of Los Angeles County
District Attorney Ira Reiner, who called the defendant a hazard to
the community.
   ``This is a blatant example of the kind of driver we must keep
off the roads and freeways, especially over the holiday weekend, for
the safety of other drivers,'' Reiner said.
   Municipal Court Commissioner Richard Grey ordered Hilbert jailed
when he couldn't post the bond on new misdemeanor charges.
   Hilbert was arrested Oct. 2 after a breath test showed his blood
alcohol level was .27 percent, nearly triple the legal maximum of
.10 percent, said Al Albergate, the district attorney's spokesman.
He is charged with drunken driving and with driving on a revoked
license.
   Since 1981, he has been convicted 10 times of drunken driving,
and has been sentenced twice to the maximum one-year term, Albergate
said. His license was revoked in 1983 on one such conviction, the
spokesman said, adding that he didn't know how much time Hilbert has
served on the various convictions.
   In six of his convictions, Hilbert's blood alcohol level
registered .28 percent or higher, according to the prosecutor on the
case, Deputy District Attorney Gary Hernsberger.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' Hernsberger said. ``What's
amazing is that he hasn't killed somebody.''

<HEAD>Judge to Hear Antitrust Suit Against Miami News Closure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge agreed Thursday to hear arguments in
a last-ditch lawsuit seeking to stop the closing of The Miami News,
but the 93-year-old daily's publisher still planned to stop the
presses Saturday.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus scheduled a hearing Friday
afternoon on a lawsuit by community newspapers, readers and News
distributors contending that closing the News would violate
antitrust laws.
   The lawsuit is based on the joint operating agreement between the
News' owner, Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. and The Miami
Herald's owner, Knight-Ridder Inc.
   Under the planned shutdown, Knight-Ridder would continue to pay a
share of profits to Cox, the plaintiffs said.
   ``It is incredible what they've done, which is to pay a
competitor not to operate,'' said Jeffrey M. Herman, one of the
lawyers representing the plaintiffs. ``It's the same as GM paying
Ford not to build cars.''
   A Chicago newspaper consultant representing a group negotiating
to buy the News said he was still working on a deal with Cox. ``It's
close,'' said John Malone. ``We are proceeding ahead with what Cox
wants.''
   Cox Newspapers President James Easterly, however, said Malone had
failed to come up with money Cox required to keep the paper open
pending the sale.
   Easterly said if the Malone deal falls through, he has no other
offers and will shut the paper down Saturday as scheduled.
   The antitrust lawsuit filed Wednesday lists as plaintiffs Florida
Publications Inc., which publishes more than a dozen community
newspapers in Dade; two Miami News readers and six independent News
distributors.
   The lawsuit asks for an injunction barring Cox and Knight-Ridder,
from shutting down the News or selling it without profit-sharing
rights under the joint operating agreement. Easterly said Cox will
contest the lawsuit.
   Knight-Ridder spokeswoman Lee Ann Schlatter said Thursday that
her company feels the lawsuit had no merit and incorrectly implies
that Knight-Ridder was involved in the decision to shut down the
News.
   The complaint, which seeks in excess of $500 million in punitive
damages, alleges that Cox and Knight-Ridder ``conspired to
monopolize the market'' for daily newspapers in Miami and that the
plaintiffs will suffer ``irreparable injury'' if the News closes.
   The lawsuit contends the deal triggering the closing of the News
conflicts with the Newspaper Preservation Act, which Congress passed
in 1970 to save failing newspapers and competing editorial voices by
allowing the opposing papers to combine their business operations.
   U.S. Justice Department officials already are independently
investigating the planned shutdown or sale of the News for possible
antitrust law violations. Federal officials have refused to discuss
the status of their probe.

<HEAD>Survey: Americans Unwilling To Pay More Taxes To Cut Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than 10 percent of Americans would be
willing to pay a higher federal income tax to reduce the national
deficit, but most believe President-elect Bush will ask for one,
according to a newspaper poll released Thursday.
   The nationwide survey of 611 adults _ conducted for USA Today
which will publish the complete results in Friday's editions _
showed only 9 percent of Americans favor a tax hike to reduce the
national deficit, but 75 percent say Bush is somewhat or very likely
to seek one.
   However, higher percentages of Americans would favor raising
taxes on gas, alcohol and tobacco if the money were earmarked solely
to reduce the government's red ink. Fifty-six percent would favor a
higher gasoline tax and 83 percent a higher tax on alcohol and
tobacco.
   Most of those surveyed _ 72 percent _ say the way to cut the
deficit is to reduce government spending, with defense spending
singled out by 50 percent as the category most easily targeted for
cutting.
   The poll, conducted Dec. 14-16, had a 4 percent margin or error.

<TEXT>
   Two federal courts cleared way Thursday for
the setting of a statewide date for election of trial judges,
delayed for years by lawsuits charging racial discrimination.
   State Attorney General Mike Moore said the court action would end
the ``piecemeal fashion'' in which Mississippi voters elect chancery
and circuit judges by allowing one general election on June 20 in
which blacks would have a fair chance of being elected.
   ``Now, I don't think Mississippi is discriminatory and I think it
is time we stood up and showed it,'' Moore said.
   No black has been elected a judge in Mississippi without first
being appointed. As a result, blacks challenged judicial election
practices in lawsuits filed in 1984 and 1985, and some judges whose
terms expired have remained in office awaiting court action on an
election date.
   The action Thursday involved the signing of final drafts of
proposed orders in two separate courts, officials said.
   Carroll Rhodes, a lawyer in Hazlehurst who represents black
plaintiffs in the four-year-old lawsuit, said an agreement had been
reach to allow federal courts in both Mississippi and Washington to
move quickly to close out all pending cases and appeals dealing with
the election of chancery and circuit judges.
   Under the agreement, primary elections will be held statewide
April 4 for the judgeships, with the general election on June 20,
Rhodes said. Earlier, elections in about half the districts had been
scheduled in February and April.
   U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. signed an order
delaying until June elections that would have been held in February
in 21 districts that have not voted for judges since 1982.
   Under a settlement of a racial bias lawsuit already worked out by
Barbour, 13 blacks had filed in those districts before a Dec. 9
deadline. Attorneys said under the agreement, filing would not be
reopened in the 21 districts.
   The other court that signed an order Thursday was a panel of
three federal judges meeting in Jackson and led by the chief judge
of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It tentatively accepted
settlement of a similar redistricting lawsuit in which election of
judges post-by-post instead of districtwide was challenged as
designed to dilute the voting strength of blacks.
   The plan calls for redrawing 19 eastern districts to allow
multijudge elections, with a Feb. 28 qualifying deadline, Rhodes
said. He said that with all candidates running in one districtwide
election, blacks could concentrate their voting strength on one
candidate, a technique called single-shot voting that has helped
minorities elsewhere.
   The state attorney general's office said the qualifying deadline
for the 19 districts would be scheduled to allow the Legislature
time to adopt the redistricting, which must be approved first by the
U.S. Justice Department under the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
   Moore said he expected rapid approval because federal
representatives participated in negotiations, in which the state
pushed for the cost-saving uniform election date and gave in on
opposing the multijudge redistricts.
   ``This is something new for Mississippi and I think it shows
there is progressive leadership in the state,'' said Rhodes. ``I
just hope this progressive leadership will continue and this will
not be the end of it.''

<HEAD>Angola Sends Aid Request to U.N., Rebels Claim Bomb Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
formally asked the United Nations on Thursday for aid to finance the
withdrawal of approximately 50,000 Cuban troops, the state news
agency ANGOP reported.
   A report monitored in Lisbon said dos Santos sent a letter to
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar requesting
international aid for the $800 million the Luanda government says it
will cost to send the Cubans home.
   The troops have supported Marxist Angola in its 13-year civil war
against U.S.- and South African-backed rebels. They are being
withdrawn as part of a peace plan for southern Africa.
   Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed pacts Dec. 22 that foresee
the gradual pullout of the Cubans and implementation of an
independence plan for neighboring South-West Africa, better known as
Namibia, which South Africa has ruled for 73 years.
   ``Because of the economic difficulties faced by Angola and Cuba,
(their economies) cannot bear the costs alone,'' ANGOP quoted dos
Santos as saying.
   In Lisbon, rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) said they planted a bomb that
exploded Tuesday in downtown Luanda, killing one person and injuring
13.
   Angola on Thursday accused the rebels of killing 31 civilians and
kidnapping 92 in terrorist attacks over an unspecified period, ANGOP
reported.
   It said troops killed 69 rebels and captured six in clashes
across Angola during the last week, with 11 soldiers killed, 33
wounded and two missing .
   Soldiers also freed 129 civilians from rebel captivity, the
report said.
   No independent confirmation was available.
   In South Africa, Foreign Affairs Minister Roelof Botha said peace
in neighboring Mozambique would mean more to his country's
international position than ending hostilities in Angola and Namibia.
   This would strengthen South Africa's role as a regional power,
Botha said in an interview broadcast on state radio.
   For years, Mozambican officials have accused the Pretoria
government of supporting rightist Mozambican National Resistance
guerrillas in their fight to topple the Marxist-oriented Maputo
government.
   Relations between the two countries improved this year, with
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano playing host to South African
President P.W. Botha at a summit in September. Mozambican officials
still refer to elements in South Africa, however, who they charge
aid the rebels' sabotage campaign.

<TEXT>
   A group of Cuban intellectuals on Thursday sharply
criticized a proposal by more than 100 writers, artists, and
scientists living abroad that President Fidel Castro hold a
referendum on extending his rule.
   Roberto Retamar, a longtime supporter of Castro who heads a
cultural center in this city, said the appeal was tainted because it
likened Cuba's situation to that of Chile. In Chile, military
President Augusto Pinochet was defeated last October in a yes-or-no
vote on extending his 15-year rule.
   Speaking at a news conference with four other intellectuals,
Retamar rejected the comparison and called Pinochet an ``assassin.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman made a similar criticism earlier
this week when he was quoted as rejecting the proposal.
   Retamar said many who signed the open letter asking for a
referendum ``would applaud the establishment of a fascist regime in
the entire world.''
   Abriel Prito, an essayist at the news conference, said such a
plebiscite is unnecessary because few societies have undergone a
period of self-examination as profound as Cuba has over the past two
years. He said Cuba has carried out perhaps ``the purest revolution
in history.''
   Those who signed the open letter to Castro asking for the
referendum come from the United States, Europe and Latin America.
The appeal was also signed by about 50 Cubans exiles.
   The letter was made public earlier this week as Castro prepares
to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Cuban revolution on Sunday.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Claim They Killed or Wounded 7,932 Soldiers in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas said Thursday they killed
or wounded 7,932 soldiers this year and a human rights group said
1,747 civilians died in that time in El Salvador's civil war.
   A report on the rebels' Radio Venceremos gave no breakdown of
dead and wounded. Nor did it say how many guerrillas were killed.
   It claimed the guerrillas, from the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, caused $3 million in property damage through
sabotage attacks, including those on numerous military installations.
   The independent Human Rights Commission of El Salvador said 1,747
civilians were killed in violent conflicts this year and 231
civilians were reported missing.
   Commission spokesman Celia Medrano told a news conference the
numbers were up from last year, when the group reported 1,415
civilians killed and 204 missing.
   The head of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, Col. Rene
Emilio Ponce, recently said the army killed 914 guerrillas and
wounded 702 in 1988.
   Like the rebels, the military did not mention its own casualties.
However, the military said it suffered a combined total of 2,039
deaths and injuries between June 1987 and May 1988.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte condemned violence from both the
left and right late Wednesday after returning from Washington, where
he underwent an evaluation of chemotherapy he is receiving for
terminal liver cancer.
   His successor, to be chosen in presidential elections in March,
must seek an end to the 9-year conflict, he said.
   ``If not, we are going to bring the country to a moment of
gigantic confrontations,'' Duarte said. ``We must seek the path of
tolerance and comprehension.''
   About 65,500 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the
war between rebels and U.S.-backed governments since 1979.

   A 35-year-old hospital porter was charged with
conspiracy and withholding information about terrorism ``regarding
Northern Ireland affairs'' after police uncovered a bomb factory in
a south London apartment, Scotland Yard said Thursday.
   In Bangor, Northern Ireland, a bomb planted by the Irish
Republican Army exploded Thursday night under a policeman's car
outside his home, police said. The bomb, containing about three
pounds of explosives, destroyed the car but the officer was inside
his home with his family and no one was hurt, they said.
   The IRA claimed responsibility in a message to Belfast news
organizations.
   Many police officers live in Bangor, a predominantly Protestant
seaside resort 10 miles northeast of Belfast, the provincial capital.
   In London, Scotland Yard identified the hospital porter as Edward
Wadley of north London and said police arrested him on Dec. 22, the
day after the arsenal was found in the Clapham area.
   A brief Scotland Yard statement gave no arrest details and did
not indicate any link with two fugitive IRA suspects being sought by
police in connection with the arsenal.
   Police found the haul after an incident in which an 18-year-old
man was shot in the stomach after breaking the window of a car
parked outside the apartment.
   Authorities say a man inside the car, a suspected IRA member,
apparently was asleep or keeping watch in the back seat when the
would-be thief tried to break in.
   A police sweep resulted and officers reported finding a cache of
Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosive, often used by the IRA; machine
guns; rifles; handguns and bomb-making equipment.
   Police say they believe two fugitive IRA suspects rented the
apartment recently.
   In Belfast, police said soldiers and police on Thursday found a
4OO-pound bomb hidden in a stone wall near the main Belfast-Dublin
railroad line in South Armagh.
   A spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with
British practice, said the explosives _ in eight bags and primed for
use _ were found about 250 yards from where a Dec. 16 bomb damaged
rail track at Kilnasaggart Bridge.
   The bomb apparently was intended for security forces moving about
the area after the bridge attack.
   ``We were expecting a booby trap of some sort,'' said the
spokesman.
   No claim of responsibility was advanced. Suspicion, however, fell
on the IRA, which uses explosives widely in its battle to drive the
British from the Protestant-dominated province and unite it with the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland to the south.

   Harrods and 65 sister department stores will stop
selling aerosols that damage the Earth's ozone shield, the store
chain announced Thursday.
   Mohamed Fayed, chairman of the House of Fraser chain that owns
Harrods, said he hoped other businesses and industries would follow
suit.
   ``The preservation of the environment is the responsiblity of
every one of us,'' he said. He did not announce a date by which the
aerosols would be off the shelves.
   Marks and Spencer PLC, a large clothing and food retailer that
purchased the U.S. Brooks Brothers chain this year, already has
vowed to stop selling aerosols by the end of the year.
   Prince Charles, who is known for his environmental concerns,
announced lsat summer that his household would give up aerosols.
   On Dec. 16, Britain, seven other European countries, and the
European Economic Community ratified a treaty limiting production of
ozone-destroying chemicals. The treaty goes into effect Jan. 1.
   Chlorofluorocarbon compounds in aerosols are one of a number of
non-toxic chemicals that can last for more than a century in the
atmosphere. They rise slowly to the ozone layer, 15-25 miles high,
where their chlorine atoms destroy ozone.
   The ozone layer protects the Earth's surface from the harmful
ultraviolet rays of the sun. Other damaging chemicals that destroy
the ozone layer include refrigeration fluids, foam-blowing agents,
and cleaning solvents.

<HEAD>Judge Questions Jurors About Copper 7 Damage Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge questioned jurors Thursday to
determine if a $8.15 million damage award against the G.D. Searle &
Co. drug firm should be overturned because of possible jury
misconduct.
   Esther Kociemba of Elk River won the award in September after a
three-month trial and almost 10 days of jury deliberations. The
verdict supported her claim that a Searle Copper-7 intrauterine
birth control device had triggered a pelvic infection that left her
infertile.
   But three of the eight jurors later signed affidavits alleging
they were the victims of verbal harassment and intimidation and had
been bullied into an ``unjust'' verdict.
   The affidavits also said newspaper accounts of the trial had been
smuggled into the jury room along with information from a medical
dictionary. U.S. District Judge Robert Renner had specifically told
the jurors not to discuss the case, read about it or consult medical
dictionaries.
   Renner questioned the jurors one at a time. He did not say when
he would issue a ruling. Under federal law, the hearing could not
delve into the process of deliberations, including the allegations
of intimidation, but only into evidence of improper outside
influence.
   In an interview following the hearing, Searle attorney, Paul
Strain, said the jurors' testimony definitely points to misconduct.
   ``The record of misconduct is even more extensive than we
thought,'' including one juror discussing the case with a relative
who is a doctor, Strain said.
   ``What is striking is the tremendous degree of use of extraneous,
prejudicial information,'' he said. ``It clearly infected the entire
deliberative process.''
   Kociemba's attorney, Michael Ciresi, said there is no basis to
Searle's motion to impeach the verdict. Ciresi and other lawyers for
Kociemba had complained in a previous, open hearing that Searle
refuses to accept its defeat and is trying to retry the case outside
the court room.
   ``I didn't believe there was any basis for the motion before the
hearing. And I don't believe anything happened during the hearing to
change that opinion,'' Ciresi said Thursday. ``Indeed, what took
place during the hearing supported the plaintiff's (Kociemba's)
position.''
   The Kociemba verdict was the first time punitive damages had been
awarded against Chicago-based Searle over the Copper-7 and Ciresi
said the verdict was a victory not only for Kociemba, but for the
more than 500 women who have suits pending against Searle over the
IUD.

<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou shurgged off
calls for his resignation on Thursday and struck back at the
opposition and press in the face of widening financial scandals that
are rocking his Socialist government.
   Addressing 140 members of his party's central committee,
Papandreou also spurned demands for immediate elections. He said
general elections would be held in June 1989, as scheduled.
   ``I repeat, with even greater emphasis this time, that I will
remain in active politics,'' he said during an hourlong speech at an
Athens hotel.
   Both conservative and Communist opposition parties have united in
demanding Papandreou's resignation and immediate elections.
   Papandreou said Thursday his Panhellenic Socialist Movement
(PASOK) was going through its worst crisis since he founded it in
1974, and accused opposition parties of plotting to undermine the
government.
   ``We do not have the right to remain passive and defensive
against the deterioration of PASOK which is being pursued,'' said
the 69-year-old premier.
   Popular support for PASOK has been eroding following a series of
multimillion-dollar financial scandals. Most of Greece's usually
pro-government press has chided the governing party.
   The latest scandal involves the sale of weapons to Iraq by a
state-owned operation. Finance Minister Dimitris Tsovolas denied
newspaper allegations that he and Papandreou gave the state-owned
arms industry permission to pay kickbacks to foreign arms dealers.
   Another scandal is swirling around the Bank of Crete and its
ousted chairman, George Koskotas. He is accused of fraud or
embezzlement involving millions of dollars, and his ties to
government leaders have created an embarrassment. Seven ministers
have quit over the scandal.
   Papandreou accused the domestic press Thursday of orchestrating
``an unhealthy and destabilizing climate by creating forged,
fabricated and unfounded stories.''
   In an effort to shore up his government, Papandreou threatened to
resign earlier in the month and asked Parliament for a vote of
confidence during debate on the 1989 budget. The deficit budget was
approved by a narrow margin.

<TEXT>
   A state communications company on
Thursday ordered a radio station run by the Roman Catholic Church to
operate at one-tenth power, a move that opposition leaders called
harassment.
   Radio Caritas news director Benjamin Fernandez said the order
from ANTELCO's department of radio communications limits how far the
station can broadcast. It had been reaching most populated areas in
this rural country of 3.5 million, but now is difficult to hear
outside this capital city.
   The station has been one of the most popular and independent in
the country.
   ANTELCO offered no explanation for its order, but foes of
President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner said it was a warning to the
station.
   Radio Caritas was blocked this week from broadcasting a panel
discussion featuring politicians and economists from outside the
governing Colorado Party. Police barred participants from entering
the station.
   Earlier this month, five Radio Caritas reporters were arrested
with opposition leaders organizing a rally for the 40th anniversary
of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Police
broke up the rally.
   Opposition leaders on Wednesday called 1988 a benchmark year in

   Rebels offered to renew peace talks
with the Sandinista government in Washington on Jan. 25, a leader of
the Nicaraguan Resistance said in Miami.
   But ``if the Sandinista government does not reach a peace accord,
the Nicaraguan Resistance will be obligated to renew the war,''
Aristides Sanchez said in a tape recording played for The Associated
Press bureau in Managua.
   Sanchez is a director of the political organization of the
U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras. Radio Liberation reporter
Alejandro Acevedo in Miami played the recording during a telephone
call to Managua.
   Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra said on Tuesday
that the government is ready to resume talks with the Contras.
   Efforts to reach government spokesmen following the rebel
announcement Thursday were unsuccessful.
   Sanchez said the proposed talks would renew negotiations that
broke down in Sapoa, Nicaragua, in June. An attempt to resume talks
in Guatemala failed in September.
   He said the rebels will give a copy of the peace proposal to
Central American presidents on Jan. 3. Sanchez suggested the talks
be held at the headquarters of the Organization of American States
in Washington.
   Agreements reached in Sapoa last March established a 60-day
cease-fire that has been renewed several times. This month, the
Sandinistas unilaterally extended the cease-fire until next June and
the rebels said they would support the continued truce.
   However, minor armed confrontations have continued.
   The Defense Ministry said on Thursday that Honduran soldiers
attacked Sandinista border guards in eastern Chinandega province,
firing M-16 rifles from Honduran territory. It did not say when the
alleged attack took place.
   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, the Foreign Ministry
meanwhile announced Thursday that less than half the 104 Nicaraguan
prisoners released by the Contras on Honduran territory on Dec. 23
had returned to Nicaragua.
   Others said they want to go to the United States, Mexico and
Canada, said ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro.
   He said 44 former prisoners crossed the border from Honduras to
Nicaragua at Las Manos.
   Those who did not return will remain in Honduras while awaiting
visas, Castro said.
   The Contras said the 96 men and eight women, some of them
Sandinista troops, were captured a year ago during battles in the
Nicaraguan provinces of Chontales, Matagalpa and Madriz.
   On Dec. 20, Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said Honduras
would not let armed groups hold prisoners illegally in Honduras.
   The rebels say they no longer hold any captives.
   More than 55,000 people have died in seven years of civil war in
Nicaragua.

   Seven of 115 complaints of police misconduct
stemming from a riot at a park on a hot August night have been
forwarded for departmental trial, a civilian review board said
Thursday.
   The Civilian Complaint Review Board said it has taken up 22 of
the 115 complaints, and has recommended to Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward that departmental trials be held for six officers on
seven allegations of brutality.
   At least 52 officers and 18 civilians required hospital treatment
for injuries received during the Aug. 7 riot at Tompkins Square
Park. A police chief accused of poor supervision resigned and two
policemen were indicted this month on assault charges.
   Most of the complaints not forwarded to the commissioner were
dropped for lack of substantiation, with complainants failing to
follow up their allegations, the board said in an interim report.
   ``Everyone's going to be disappointed about this investigation,''
said Thomas Reppetto, the head of the Citizens Crime Commission, a
nonprofit group that monitors crime in New York City.
   ``Civilian Complaint Review Boards around the country tend to be
very legalistic, that's the way they have to be,'' Reppetto added.
``That has a tendency to disappoint people who thought a civilian
review board was going to work a miracle.''
   The report expressed frustration that no police officers had
volunteered evidence.
   ``Here you've got over 100 complaints in the presence of 400
police officers and 40 sergeants over a period of about six hours in
about a six-block area and no police officer has come forward to
either defend one of his fellow officers or to provide evidence that
one of these things happened,'' board member Dan Johnston said at a
news conference.
   Johnston accused the Policeman's Benevolent Association of
recommending officers not cooperate, which police union President
Phil Caruso denied.
   Chairwoman Mary Burke Nicholas said the board would hear 27 more
complaints on Jan. 18 and should resolve the rest by February.
   She said at the news conference that of the 15 cases closed
without disciplinary charges, eight were dropped because
complainants or victims were uncooperative or unavailable. Three
other complaints were withdrawn, two were found to be outside the
board's jurisdiction, one was unsubstantiated and one was closed
because the officer could not be identified, the report said.
   ``In my judgment, we're going to end up with a large number of
cases where we believe the abuse occurred, and where we can't
identify the officer,'' said Johnston.
   Videotapes taken by residents showed that several officers
covered their badges with dark tape to keep from being identified.
   The melee between police and demonstrators was sparked by
enforcement of a curfew in Tompkins Square Park.
   The park, in a Lower East Side neighborhood called the East
Village, is a gathering place for musicians, drug dealers, homeless
people and teen-agers. Its neighbors range from squatters to owners
of luxury condominiums, the latter group favoring the curfew.

   The Federal Aviation Administration, mystified
at how a bomb got aboard Pan Am Flight 103, began searching for
possible security lapses by U.S. airlines abroad and directed
tighter screening of passengers and their baggage.
   Government officials acknowledged Wednesday that a week after the
Pan American World Airways jumbo jet exploded over Scotland, killing
at least 270 people, there are no hard leads on who put the
explosive device on the jet or where the deed was done.
   Shortly after it was confirmed Wednesday by British investigators
that a bomb caused the Boeing 747 to crash Dec. 21 on a flight to
New York from London, the Reagan administration promised ``all
available assistance'' in investigating the bombing.
   U.S. officials said there was a wide range of terrorist groups
that may have been responsible. But Paul Bremer, the State
Department's chief of counterterrorism, told reporters it was too
early to focus suspicion on a particular group.

   While X-ray machines are severely limited in
keeping modern explosives off airliners, researchers say they have
developed a device that can detect bombs inside luggage with uncanny
regularity.
   But no airline has ordered one of the devices, and with the
exception of two prototype machines used in a yearlong test program
in San Francisco and Los Angeles, no airports have put the machine
into operation.
   The disclosure Wednesday that a bomb detonated aboard a Pan Am
jumbo jet last week over Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard, is
likely to spur interest in the new explosives detection device,
industry officials said.
   The machine goes by the name of Termal Neutron Analysis device,
or TNA, and is about twice the size of an airport X-ray machine.
During the yearlong test under a contract from the Federal Aviation
Administration it demonstrated a 95 percent detection rate with few
false alarms, the agency said.

   Studies of nearly 29,000 breast-cancer patients
leave no doubt that drug and hormone therapies improve chances of
surviving the disease, the second-leading cancer killer of American
women, researchers say.
   Analysis of 61 studies showed that a synthetic hormone called
tamoxifen improves the survival of breast cancer victims over age
50, while chemotherapy helps younger women.
   During the first five years after treatment, tamoxifen reduced
the odds of death among older women by about one-fifth, the analysis
revealed, while a combination of chemotherapy drugs reduced the odds
by about one-quarter for younger victims.
   The studies were started as far back as 20 years ago.

   Federal regulators are racing the clock to
complete a string of bailout packages for insolvent savings and loan
institutions before the end of the year when tax breaks for
investors will be cut in half.
   Officials expect that before Sunday as many as 200 failed savings
and loans will have been dealt with this year, setting a
post-Depression record. By contrast, 48 S&Ls were merged or closed
last year.
   So far the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has handled the cases of
184 failed S&Ls, including two bailouts announced Wednesday that are
among the largest.
   The bank board put together a $5.1 billion package to assist in
the takeover of five of the most troubled savings and loans in Texas
by an investment group led by Ronald O. Perelman, the head of
Revlon, the cosmetics company.

   The new justice minister today rejected calls for
his resignation after admitting he received donations from a company
at the center of a stock-profiteering scandal that reaches deep into
Japanese politics.
   As part of a reform drive launched in response to the scandal,
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita appointed Takashi Hasegawa to the
post two days ago with a mandate to probe the company for suspected
bribery.
   Hasegawa was to have personally headed the investigation of
Recruit Co., whose dealings have led to the resignations of 17
prominent business and political officials.

   Suggestion: All the blame for the ``economic
illiteracy'' so widespread in the American populace should not fall
on the nation's schools.
   It is not just in the classroom that economics is shrouded in
ignorance, mystery and superstitution, but also in politics and
government, in the workplace and in the shopping mall, and just
about everywhere else you care to look.
   For example, when congressmen discuss the state of the economy
with officials of the Federal Reserve Board, emotion and political
prejudices often overshadow the whole debate.
   Legislators are wont to charge that the Fed is heedlessly hurting
their constituents by setting interest rates too high.
   A Fed official counters by declaring that the Fed doesn't set
interest rates, market forces do. And interest rates would be a lot
lower if only Congress stopped voting for inflationary spending
programs and balanced its budget for a change.
   Ordinary citizens may not have been given much schooling on the
factors that determine interest rates, or on the workings of the Fed.
   But they may quickly come to the conclusion that both sides in
this argument are engaged in some self-serving posturing.
   The results of an economics test given to more than 8,000 high
school students made a lot of headlines when they were made public
the other day.
   Fewer than half of the students, it was reported, showed a grasp
of such basic economic concepts as inflation and the gross national
product. ``Our schools are producing a nation of economic
illiterates,'' said one of the study's authors.
   Some of the sample questions from the test were not as simple as
they looked, though, if you consider the emotional baggage that
comes with so many basic economic terms.
   One multiple-choice item, for instance, called for a definition
of ``profits.'' By the time they reach high school, how many
Americans have not heard that word used as a pejorative?
   Would the question have read the same if the test-takers were
asked to define ``earnings of a business'' or ``net income?''
   If economic ignorance begins in the schools, a case can certainly
be made that it is perpetuated by the pillars of capitalism as it is
practiced in this country.
   The bank that gives away ``free'' toaster ovens to new depositors
rather than promoting competitive interest rates is doing nothing to
further the cause of enlightenment.
   And the ``greed is good'' school of financiers on Wall Street
hardly proved their case when several of them went to prison.
   Many honest business people also reinforce ignorance and
suspicion about the free enterprise system by talking in euphemisms
and defensive generalities about what they do at work.
   Consider the stock market. Of what social benefit is this
institution, prone as it is to menacing the rest of the economy with
wild and unpredictable swings?
   When this question is put to Wall Street leaders, they typically
invoke phrases like ``corporate democracy'' and ``capital
formation.''
   Nobody seems comfortable enough to acknowledge that the market is
a machine driven by individuals' hunger for wealth, designed to
harness the vast amount of energy created by that hunger, and to put
it to as much general social benefit as possible.
   Whether it serves that function as well as it might, of course,
is a separate question. If it is worthy of its place in the system,
it could certainly stand up to the scrutiny of a well-informed
society of economic literates.
   It might even benefit from that scrutiny by gaining a little
respect.

   Nancy Gardner hangs out on the subway platform
defiantly chain-smoking, a tough customer in leather and denim.
Other commuters give her wide berth.
   Anybody can see she's looking for trouble.
   And when it arrives _ often in groups of teen-age thugs who
victimize people in and around subway stations _ Gardner wants
nothing more than to get in the thick of it.
   For the last three months, that's been her job.
   As part of an elite, 23-officer plainclothes unit of the transit
police known as the Repeat Offender Robbery Strike Force, Gardner
and her partner, Officer Roger Fanti, spend hours loitering around
subway stations, waiting for crime to happen and trying to ensure
that the subway offers no escape.
   So far, the unit has chalked up 42 arrests, and Gardner is
responsible for eight of those.
   ``I especially get satisfaction out of robbery arrests,'' said
Gardner, 26, who at 5-foot-4 and 110 pounds, has had to push around
perpetrators twice her size. ``A lot of bad guys show no remorse and
don't think twice about taking people's property and leaving them
injured and bleeding. We try to get the best possible case so they
do time.''
   One evening during the busy Christmas shopping season, Gardner
and Fanti spent hours following a group of teen-agers as they tried
to rob a shopper at Macy's, wandered in and out of the subway and
nearby stores and finally made a grab for racks of clothes from one
shop.
   Four of the would-be shoplifters ended up in handcuffs, and
Gardner suffered a bruised knee in the struggle. She knows that
violence comes with the job, but it is a job she always has wanted
to do.
   ``When I was growing up, I always thought cops were heros,'' said
Gardner, a 3{-year veteran of the transit police who hopes to become
a detective. ``Now I want to make a difference for my son. Every
little bit counts.''

<HEAD>Historians' First Rough Draft on Rating Reagan: Fair to Medium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury is still out on Ronald Reagan, but
history is likely to regard him as an average to good president,
according to some scholars of the presidency.
   With little time left in Reagan's final term, The Associated
Press interviewed eight presidential scholars including specialists
in history, political science and social psychology.
   Their tentative verdict: Reagan will get high marks for his use
of the White House pulpit to unite the country and will get credit
for improving East-West relations even though Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev may have been more responsible for it than he.
   ``My view is that he will be viewed by the American people as an
above-average president,'' said Thomas Cronin, a historian of the
presidency at Colorado College who calls himself a moderate
Democrat. ``I think the historians and biographers will treat him a
little bit more harshly, still ranking him at least an average
president but not as high as the American people now do or will.''
   But Daniel Franklin, a professor of political science at Colgate
University who is critical of many Reagan policies, said, ``I think,
in the historical sense, somewhere down the road, that Reagan will
be considered as a somewhat worse than average president because of
the problems that he has left us.''
   If the economy turns sour in the wake of his administration's
record budget and trade deficits, Reagan may go down in history like
Calvin Coolidge as a president who failed to take action to stave
off coming disaster.
   Some scholars said Reagan's reputation will also suffer from
scandals in his administration and from his failure to deal
effectively with such social ills as the plight of the homeless.
   ``I think probably in the short range reaction in the next five
or 10 years, even liberal and radical historians will find something
good to say about him and that will be that he somehow represented a
kind of quality of Americanism and a sense of national unity and he
projected that from the White House,'' said Herman Belz, a
neo-conservative historian at the University of Maryland.
   ``Whether or not in the long run our relations with the Soviets
will be so good that people will always say it started in the fall
of 1988 under Ronald Reagan I don't know, but it would certainly
look that way,'' said Vaughn Davis Bornet, professor emeritus of
history at Southern Oregon State College and a self-described
moderate Republican.
   Edward W. Chester, a conservative historian at the University of
Texas, said it is too early to evaluate Reagan. But, echoing many of
his academic colleagues, he said, ``The deficit does bother me. The
deficit does bother me.''
   ``I think we can say history will probably look most kindly upon
him not necessarily for any substantive policy changes that he
brought about but for the tone that he brought to the office and for
a renewed sense of national pride,'' said Charles W. Dunn, a former
Republican congressional aide who teaches political science at
Clemson University and has written widely on the presidency.
   Austin Ranney, chairman of the Department of Political Science at
the University of California at Berkeley, said, ``On just the
externalities of it, I think Reagan's presidency, with one huge
`if,' will probably go down as one of the most successful ones
certainly in this century and maybe ever.''
   However, comparing Reagan with one of the predecessors the
president most admires, Ranney also said that ``Reagan may go down
in history pretty much the way Coolidge did'' if some economists'
predictions of economic collapse come true.
   ``Coolidge is not seen now as a successful president followed by
Hoover, a bum, but as a president whose do-nothing policies led to
the huge crash of the early '30s that Hoover was the victim of,'' he
said.
   Dean Keith Simonton, a professor of psychology at the University
of California at Davis who has devised a formula for predicting how
history will rate presidents, said, ``When you put all the pros and
all the cons in the equation, Ronald Reagan comes out as a slightly
above average president.''
   One of the ``pro'' factors for Reagan, said Simonton, is the
improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations that he and Gorbachev have
forged.
   ``He gets nice points for that in foreign policy when actually he
didn't take the initiative for that,'' Simonton said.
   ``In all fairness, Gorbachev deserves more credit than he does,''
said Colorado College's Cronin.
   ``Still,'' said Southern Oregon's Bornet, ``Ronald Reagan stepped
forward as usual and managed to pin it on himself and that's going
to be hard to erase, I'll tell you.''
   Clemson's Dunn, similarly, argued, ``A good leader also must
seize the opportunity, and Gorbachev offered an opportunity to play
for high stakes in the international arena. He seized that; he was
not frozen in place by rigid ideology, and thus I think one has to
give him credit.''
   From Berkeley, Ranny said the relaxation of East-West tensions
was the most important of Reagan's accomplishments in foreign policy.
   ``Now you might say that's because he got lucky and had Gorbachev
there, and I wouldn't quarrel with that,'' he said. ``Nevertheless,
it did happen. And I think when historians look back at that, they
will say that he was in terms of foreign policy one of the most
successful postwar presidents that we have had.''
   Psychologist Simonton said one big factor working in Reagan's
favor is the simple fact that he was the first president since
Dwight Eisenhower to serve eight years.
   ``The longer you serve the more events happen that can be
credited to you, whether or not you are responsible for them,'' he
said. ``You make a thick chapter in the history of America under
your name.''
   Although Reagan recently pictured himself as the adversary of a
``Washington colony'' protecting special interests at the expense of
ordinary citizens, some scholars argued that one of his own chief
shortcomings is his failure to be an advocate for those on the
outside.

   ``There will be a feeling that he was largely indifferent to
those without voice in Washington, that he responded much more to
upper middle class and middle class America,'' said Cronin. ``The
presidency ought to be a place which raises its voice on behalf of
those who don't have the powerful lobbies.''
   Cronin is self-described as a Democrat with a liberal viewpoint
compared with Reagan's, but the more conservative Chester agreed,
``I also think Reagan could perhaps have done more for the
homeless.''
   The Iran-Contra affair and the investigations and indictments
that have marked Reagan's administration also will cast their
shadow, the scholars said.
   ``The people will forget that quickly; the historians won't,''
said Cronin. ``The historians will have chapters on the sleaze stuff
and they'll call it as bad or equal to the Watergate mess.''
   Some who praised Reagan highly on other grounds conceded he was
not as attentive as he should have been to his duties.
   ``He didn't keep his ear to the ground enough and he didn't have
enough interest in political life, the warp and woof of it, to do as
good a job as he could have,'' said the neo-conservative Belz.
   In strikingly similar language, Ranny said, ``I imagine he loses
a few points because of the large number of scandals and indictments
and things like that,'' and Simonton said that ``he is probably
going to get some negative points'' because of such troubles.
   In comparing Reagan with past presidents, scholars cited the
names ranging from Eisenhower to Lyndon Johnson.
   ``Personality and character issues for 20 years have overwhelmed
evaluation of Lyndon Johnson as president and if that's any
precedent, then maybe for several decades it will be difficult to
get down to serious business with Ronald Reagan,'' said Bornet, who
has written extensively on Johnson.
   Johnson, he said, ``is still the crude, cornpone president, and
Reagan is going to continue to be for a long time this image people
watched on TV and this person the press correctly portrayed as
essentially a lazy president.''
   As for Eisenhower, he has undergone a re-evaluation in recent
years, with scholars believing him a much more activist president
than first believed. Ranney said, ``If future scholarship finds out
that behind the scenes and when the truth is known Reagan himself
was also a much more hands-on active president than we now believe _
and incidentally it is unlikely that they will find that _ he might
undergo the same kind of upgrading.''
   Dunn, however, said, ``Definitely a comparison of Eisenhower and
Reagan is in order. Eisenhower had a very subtle style of leadership
that evidently caused him to lead more effectively than most people
thought he was leading. Reagan's leadership I don't think will come
off as that kind of subtle hidden hand leadership so much as it has
been leadership through orchestration of symbols and movement of the
public mind.''
   On the other hand, the Clemson political scientist said, Reagan
may also be in for the kind of scaling down of his reputation that
John F. Kennedy has suffered as the force of his personality recedes.
   ``There is no longer the Camelot mystique to Kennedy; a lot of
that has worn off,'' he said. ``I suspect that with Ronald Reagan
there will be a little bit of wearing off of the mystique that
surrounds him.''

   John Sullivan's lawless young life was
already careening out of control by the time the 12-year-old struck
and killed two people with a stolen car while trying to outrun the
cops.
   ``I knew sooner or later there was going to be an accident,''
said Pauline Payne, the 72-year-old great-grandmother who raised the
boy from infancy after his unwed parents abandoned him. ``I knew he
was going to do the wrong thing.''
   Now, she said, ``There's nothing I can say but cry.''
   John L. Sullivan III, a wisp his family called Johnny Boy,
admitted responsibility for the Oct. 24 deaths of a father of nine
children and an 11-year-old girl. He's now serving four years at a
maximum security lockup for juveniles in rural northeastern
Pennsylvania.
   He was a street-savvy career criminal before age 10, when his
first arrest was recorded _ for stealing $327 from under his
great-grandmother's pillow. His family said he was stealing bicycles
years before that.
   His rap sheet includes 13 arrests, five for stealing cars, in the
last two years. He escaped five times from minimum-security juvenile
homes, committing more crimes every time he hit the streets.
   Johnny Boy, who turned 13 on Dec. 12, was on the loose at the
time of his fatal joyride, although he was supposed to be under
watch, awaiting placement in a secure state lockup that was too
crowded to take him right away.
   How could a boy so young get into so much trouble? Why didn't
anybody stop him?
   A litany of failure offers clues: a broken home, a guardian too
old to keep up with Johnny Boy, lack of resources in a social
services system that should have intervened before things got out of
control and an overcrowded juvenile justice system ill-equipped for
criminals so young.
   ``We normally don't get kids that young in that kind of
trouble,'' said Mingo Stroeber, an attorney with the Defender
Association of Philadelphia, which handled the case.
   ``There are very few programs equipped to deal with kids that
young. Nobody seemed to know what to do with him,'' Miss Stroeber
said. ``These kids are victims. His family failed him. The dependent
child system failed him. The juvenile court system failed him. We as
a society failed.''
   Others labeled him incorrigible.
   ``There are bad seeds. I've never seen one like this. He had no
appreciation for Western values,'' said Family Court Judge Frank
Reynolds.
   Johnny Boy exudes a peculiar combination of street-smart
toughness and moppet charm. Prosecutors consider him a corrupt
man-child who manipulates people to get his way. His lawyers thought
him lovable enough to adopt.
   He caused a crash that killed two people, then asked for crayons
and a coloring book in jail.
   He bought flowers and cards for his great-grandmother on Mother's
Day, then swiped her cash as she slept.
   He could steal a car in seconds, but because he stands just 5
feet tall and weighs 100 pounds, he had to sit on umbrellas, jackets
and other makeshift booster seats to help him see over the steering
wheel.
   Today, when most boys his age are in junior high school, John
Sullivan is living behind 12-foot-high chain-link fences topped with
barbed wire at the North Central Treatment Facility in Danville, Pa.
   Johnny Boy's lifetime of trouble began just months after he was
born. He was given to his paternal great-grandmother by a mother who
didn't want him and a father who is a confessed murderer.
   Pauline Payne raised him as best she could in the nasty North
Philadelphia neighborhood.
   His father, John Sullivan Jr., 32, pleaded guilty in October to
third-degree murder for stabbing his girlfriend, who he said had
been unfaithful. Sullivan was also charged with attempted murder in
1977 and with robbery, conspiracy and drunken driving in 1982.
   No one knows what happened to his mother, Lena Daniels. She is
believed dead, possibly murdered, and may have spent time in a North
Carolina prison, according to fragments gleaned from 12 interviews
with acquaintances and authorities. Johnny Boy, who wasn't made
available for an interview, didn't know her at all.
   ``His mother was wild,'' said Mrs. Payne. ``Neither one (mother
or father) was going to take care of him.''
   Mrs. Payne has lived in a nursing home since May, when she broke
her leg in a fall. In an interview, a reporter's mention of Johnny
Boy made her shiver.
   ``His legs are longer than mine and younger, too,'' she said. ``I
couldn't keep up with him. There are lots of things you can't do
when you get up in age. I knowed he was going to get into trouble.''
   The first hint came when he was 7. Ghetto gangs appeared outside
his great-grandmother's rowhouse at night and whistled for him to
come out and romp.
   ``He got with the bad crowd, started stealing bikes, stealing
cars and driving cars,'' said Mrs. Payne. ``He wasn't a bad little
boy. He just got in with them older boys.''
   She said she tried to keep Johnny Boy out of trouble and gave him
love. ``He'd come and look at me with them pitiful eyes and ask for
a dollar. I'd give that little boy my heart. He knowed I was
soft-hearted.''
   But there was no one else to head off trouble.
   ``This kid had a poor hand dealt to him. He was not given the
tools to make it,'' said Gerald Stanshine, an attorney with the
Defender Association.
   ``He's been on the streets more or less raising himself,'' added
Harvey Crudup, executive director of a juvenile detention center.
``The reason it came to everybody's attention is that he killed two
people. He probably could have gone on stealing cars for years.''
   Johnny Boy's first arrest was July 16, 1986, for stealing $327
from his great-grandmother. Mrs. Payne turned him in but later
dropped the charges.
   Before that month was out, he was arrested three times for
robbery and once for arson.
   Last spring, he was arrested for theft and for unauthorized use
of an auto. More charges of car theft and running away followed in
June.
   On July 5, he was sentenced to a state lockup at Loysville and
given a transfer date of Sept. 6 because no space was immediately
available. Johnny Boy was placed in a juvenile home that was no
match for him.
   Three times, he fled and was re-arrested. Each time, he was
charged with theft, receiving stolen property and unauthorized use
of an auto.
   To hold him, authorities wanted to put him in the Youth Study
Center, the city's only maximum-security lockup for juveniles. But
the 105-bed facility was 57 kids over its limit. And under a 1987
court order, the city agreed not to take anyone younger than 13.
   The courts sent him back to a home that had locks on the doors
and windows, but no bars.
   ``I couldn't hold him because it's against the law,'' said
Reynolds, the Family Court judge. ``It broke my heart.''

   ``There were red lights flashing here. We knew if John Sullivan
hit the streets, John Sullivan would commit a crime, probably with a
car. We knew it, but we were powerless to hold him,'' Reynolds said.
   District Attorney Ronald Castille derisively called the homes
``escape shelters'' because 40 to 50 juveniles run away from them
each month. His office has asked the city for 100 additional
maximum-security spaces for hard-core offenders.
   ``We just don't have enough space. It's not easy to explain to
the families of the victims. You have to defend a system you know
stinks,'' said Al Toczydlowski, deputy district attorney in charge
of the juvenile division.
   Johnny Boy created his own diversion to slip out of the Juvenile
Justice Center on Oct. 8. While other boys staged a fight, he stole
a set of keys from a guard.
   Two weeks later, he and two chums, aged 13 and 14, prowled a
parking lot, looking for a car. They opted for a gray 1986
Oldsmobile Ciera, smashing a back window to get in.
   Using a screw driver with expert precision, Johnny Boy pried off
the ignition lock on the steering column and hot-wired the starter.
   Police spotted the joy riders running a red light and gave chase
in a cruiser equipped with flashing dome lights but no siren.
   With the cops on his tail, blowing their horn and flashing their
high beams, Sullivan ran four stop signs and another red light.
   It was 5:30 p.m. Rush hour.
   ``I didn't want to get caught,'' the boy told police. ``I just
floored it and took off. I was doing about 60 miles an hour.''
   The Oldsmobile rammed a 1986 Chrysler LeBaron driven by William
O'Connor, a 53-year-old real estate agent on his way home from work.
O'Connor's first wife had died of cancer in 1976 and he later
married her sister. Between them, they had nine children.
   The Chrysler careened into Tyesha Tate, 11, a sixth-grader
walking to the grocery store with her sister, Robin, 7. They were a
block from home.
   Tyesha, who sang in the choir of the Second Baptist Church of
Nicetown, died at a hospital. Her sister, who suffered critical head
injuries, was released Dec. 5.
   ``The pursuit probably lasted 30 seconds,'' said Officer William
Rhodes, who chased Sullivan in the cruiser. ``I said to my partner,
`He's going to crash that car.' We were really upset when we found
out other people had been hit.''
   Johnny Boy suffered scratches on his arms and face. In handcuffs,
he was shown the Tate girl's body.
   ``He wasn't upset. He wasn't anything. The only thing he said
was, `Oh, no,''' said Rhodes.
   Johnny Boy was charged with homicide by vehicle, involuntary
manslaughter, aggravated assault, auto theft, unlawful use of an
auto and conspiracy.
   Because he is a juvenile, he was tried under the single charge of
delinquency. In Pennsylvania, no one under 14 can be tried as an
adult unless the charge is murder.
   ``There's more than enough blame to spread around,'' said Richard
Schwartz, executive director of the Juvenile Law Center, an advocacy
group.
   ``The solution is to build another major lockup for several
million dollars we don't have or plan for a program to deal with the
problem up front when juveniles first get into trouble,'' Schwartz
said.
   ``It makes more sense to spend money to build a barn that works
rather than spend money on locks for a door that's already open. You
can't do patchwork repairs on a juvenile justice system.''

   It was the year they held a presidential election and half the
nation's voters decided to stay home.
   It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered,
barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the
world. It was the year an early decision to let Yellowstone burn
altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come.
   It was the year Oprah decided to diet, Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General Edwin
Meese III decided to resign, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart decided to
confess his sins and Michael Spinks decided to challenge world
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.
   Some decisions worked; others didn't.
   Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two surviving
whales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet  Reagan and Bush
on Dec. 7 and addressed the
United Nations, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, he
promised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armed
forces.
   The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit Soviet
Armenia. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that tens of
thousands had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole cities
crumbled under the quake's force. The official death count had
ranged as high as 55,000, but eventually the Soviets said just under
25,000 people were confirmed dead.
   Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in
from around the world. It was the first time since World War II that
the Soviet Union had accepted disaster relief from the United States.
   Reagan paid his first visit to Moscow in June for a summit that
failed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammered
away on human rights issues, and Gorbachev later sent America living
proof of his commitment to change.
   Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, father of the Soviet dissident
movement, was allowed his first trip outside the Soviet Union after
years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies.
   Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than
5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began in
July in 32 cities and continued through the year. Roe vs. Wade, the
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old,
intact.
   Anthony McLeod Kennedy, confirmed as a Supreme Court justice by a
unanimous Senate, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but
gave no hint of his views.
   Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the
once-powerful.
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they
plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded U.S. banks. Harry
and Leona Helmsley, the king and queen of New York real estate,
pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges.
   Republican Evan Mecham of Arizona became the first governor in a
half-century to be impeached and removed from office, although he
was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan.
   Oliver North, John Poindexter, Richard Secord and Albert Hakim
pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling
arms to Iran and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time when
U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned.
   Congress refused to restore military aid to the Contras but
decided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels and
the Sandinista government reached a temporary truce.
   In a decision that stunned Israel, President Reagan authorized
talks with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization for the
first time in at least 13 years. ``Our object is not a dialogue,''
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said. ``Our object is peace.''
   Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after a
United Nations-sponsored cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talks
opened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. In
Afghanistan, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but the
guerrilla war raged on.

   From the days when inventor Thomas
Edison's light bulb first lit the nights of 1879, Americans have
been regarded as naturally inventive and creative.
   Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and
engineers at General Electric's Research and Development Center,
which traces its roots to the Edison Electrical Light Company formed
in 1878 to support the experiments of Thomas Edison.
   GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which
uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal
organs without X-rays.
   Real diamonds were concocted in one of their laboratories, not
pulled from the depths of the earth.
   In 1979, GE was the first company to pass the 50,000th patent
mark.
   But GE's _ and America's _ technological lead is being threatened
by the Japanese who, up until now, have had a reputation as clever
copycats.
   Since the end of World War II, the Japanese have borrowed
American inventions, improved them and turned them into inexpensive
household staples. Color television sets, transistor radios and
videocassettee recorders were all original American ideas the
Japanese have capitalized on.
   All that is changing.
   The Japanese are no longer content to pick the brains of American
scientists and engineers for new technology, says Roland W. Schmitt,
president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy and former
vice president of corporate research and development at GE.
   The Japanese are trying to be innovators, Schmitt says.
   Their aggressive patenting efforts prove that. Japan now acquires
more patents worldwide than any other country.
   Schmitt says the United States still leads the way in developing
new technology. ``But Japan is now in a stage where they're starting
to do this,'' he said.
   Japanese business executives say it's only natural for their
companies to develop their own technology.
   ``Any company that hopes to continue making progress will require
innovation, be it through its own or transferred technology,'' said
Kazuya Hosaka, manager of Hitachi Ltd.'s patent office in Tokyo.
   Many in this country question whether the Japanese can be
pioneering.
   The Japanese acquire hundreds of patents each year, they're quick
at turning inventions into products and their students study science
and technology in an education system considered superior in those
areas.
   But they're strangled by a culture that frowns upon risk-taking
and prizes collective action over individual effort. Their
scientists and engineers aren't trained to be pioneering.
   Americans, meanwhile, are encouraged to be creative.
   ``We educate our scientists to be pioneers,'' Schmitt said.
   A recent study for the National Science Foundation showed that in
1987, three Japanese companies garnered the most U.S. patents:
Hitachi with 873, Canon with 850 and Toshiba with 830.
   GE, which until 1986 had held the No. 1 spot for 25 years, was
fourth with 782 patents.
   GE executives at the company's R&D center, located in a sprawling
complex of buildings overlooking the Mohawk River, dispute the
results of the patent study done by Computer Horizons, a consulting
company. They argue GE would still rank as patent leader if the
study had included patents granted to RCA, which GE acquired in 1986.
   ``Whoever did the study obviously didn't know RCA was a
subsidiary of GE,'' said James C. Davis Jr., manager of patent and
legal operations at GE.
   Top GE officials, though, see the study as a warning.
   ``It doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned,'' said Walter Robb,
vice president of corporate research and development at GE. ``There
are still three Japanese companies in the top four.''
   Moreover, the Japanese are beating the United States is their
ability to rapidly commercialize inventions, such as the VCR.
   ``We get out of the starting block fast,'' Schmitt said. ``But we
lose it on the long stretch. We've lost the ability to do the long
haul.''
   America's best hope in its competition with Japan may be its
education system. The United States is far ahead of Japan in an area
vital to technological and scientific development: the encouragement
of creative thought.
   Yet serious problems exist in America's education system.
   ``We have fewer and fewer students with an interest in science
and technology,'' said Schmitt, a former chairman of the National
Science Board.
   He believes that for the United States to remain No. 1 in science
and technology it must, in some ways, imitate the Japanese.
   ``The Japanese understand that manufacturability and customer
preferences are integral parts of the innovation process, not
afterthoughts,'' Schmitt said. ``I see no reason why we Americans
can't renew our skills at the application of science and technology
while maintaining our strength as pioneers.''

<HEAD>Little-Known Tax Change Could Cause Big Problems For Firms,
Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Picture this: You've just undergone extensive
surgery for which the insurance company has picked up most of the
tab. But by year's end you're suddenly forced to pay taxes on those
benefits just as if they were part of your regular income.
   Then you're socked with taxes on other company-sponsored extras,
like the group life insurance policy or the subsidized day-care
program and night classes. Even those daily meals in the company
cafeteria aren't safe.
   Welcome to Section 89, known to some tax experts and companies as
the ``Twilight Zone'' of the 1986 tax reform law.
   While it's unlikely such a nightmarish scenario could occur, the
potential is in place under the little-known provision that mandates
changes in corporate America's employee-benefit structure starting
next year.
   The intention of the new rules had been to encourage employers to
offer health insurance and other benefits to more of their workers _
and more democratically. But many tax experts say the opposite is
likely to occur, and the harsh penalties for companies that break
the law could create a slew of tax hardships for employees.
   Section 89 is divided into two parts. One requires businesses to
communicate to their employees exactly what benefits are being
offered and the qualifications for receiving them. Failure to spell
these out means employees must include the entire value of the
benefits in their gross income.
   ``If an employee's health insurance paid out $50,000 for surgery
... he could be taxed on that amount,'' explained Thomas J. Zesk, a
senior manager with Deloitte Haskins & Sells.
   And if companies fail to report that income on their employee's
W-2 tax form, they can be fined, he said.
   Most big companies already have written benefit plans in place,
so their employees need not worry about paying taxes on important
health benefits or on the savings derived from company-subsidized
child-care programs or meals in the cafeteria, tax experts say.
   Those requirements of Section 89 will hit small businesses the
hardest.
   Even if companies fail to comply, the penalties are ``so
Draconian'' that they probably wouldn't be imposed, said Thomas
Veal, a senior manager with the accounting firm of Touche Ross & Co.
   But the other portion of Section 89, which deals with
``discriminatory'' benefits plans, has many companies concerned,
experts say.
   The new law says that if top-paid company executives _ those
making around $52,230 a year or more _ are given more health or life
insurance benefits than lesser-paid employees, the top brass must
pay taxes on the ``excess.''
   The idea was to encourage companies to distribute benefits
equally, especially to the 37 million Americans who currently don't
have health insurance.
   ``The intent was somewhat noble, but I think they went overboard.
It's a prime example of overkill,'' Zesk said.
   In order to comply with this part of the new rules companies must
submit to a lengthy testing procedure that determines whether
benefits are available to at least 90 percent of the work force,
including part-timers who work at least 17.5 hours a week.
   Tax experts say that many companies may just find it cheaper to
pay their executives more money to make up for the taxes they'll pay
on the cushier benefits, than to provide more benefits for the
rank-and-file employees.
   Others may decide to cut back on the core benefits provided to
everyone or else make do with fewer part-timers, they say.
   For now, companies across the country are working with accounting
firms to prepare for Section 89.
   ``Some clients have gathered the data (for the testing procedure)
and are going forward ... and some are still at the stumped and
disbelief stage,'' said Veal.

<HEAD>Tulsa Company Seeing Success By Fiber-Optic Light</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIL BROYLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barely more than three years ago, the
Williams Companies and career pipeliner Roy Wilkens decided to take
a risk in the fledgling technology of fiber-optic communications.
   Overnight, Wilkens went from being president of a successful
pipeline company to a dingy basement office surrounded by cardboard
boxes, where he had only six employees. At first, he didn't even
have a telephone.
   ``My God,'' Wilkens said he thought to himself. ``What have I got
myself into?''
   Although it didn't look that way at first, he and the company
whose fortunes had been tied almost exclusively to the cyclical
fates of the energy industry were about to leap to light speed.
   The new technology allows strands of optical glass as thin as
hairs, encased in underground cables, to carry huge volumes of
information via bursts of laser light.
   Comparing the quality of fiber-optic transmissions to regular
telephone lines, Wilkens said, is like comparing a compact disk to a
78-rpm record.
   The absence of noise from radio frequency and electromagnetic
interference means both voice and computer data can be digitalized
and sent long distances in less time for less money.
   Wilkens, 45, was president of Williams Pipe Line, a subsidiary of
the Williams Companies, when the company first began exploring new
uses for its out-of-service petroleum pipelines in 1985.
   At the same time, regional telecommunications companies were
tapping Williams' pipeline-building expertise for fiber-optic cable.
   Someone suggested Williams could run fiber-optic cables through
its old pipelines.
   ``That's how we really stumbled into the business,'' Wilkens
said. ``We decided to go ahead and make that move and not look back.
... We moved into it very quickly and we were extremely successful.''
   The parent company quickly invested $200 million in the
fiber-optic system. The National Society of Professional Engineers
selected the company's 3,800-mile network as one of the outstanding
engineering achievements of 1986.
   By the end of 1987, when the Williams Telecommunications Company
merged with LDX Net, Inc., to become Williams Telecommunications
Group, it had more than 5,000 miles of fiber-optic line.
   At the end of 1987, the telecommunications company's annualized
revenues had reached $109 million from an annual rate of $8 million
at the beginning of that year.
   WTG surged into profitability this year well ahead of
expectations, with a third-quarter operating profit of $5.3 million
compared with an operating loss of $7.8 million in the third quarter
of 1987.
   WTG will complete construction of its own fiber optic cable to
New York next month to replace a line it had been leasing.
   The company is expanding from Chicago to New York by purchasing a
400-mile fiber-optic line and constructing a 500-mile segment,
pushing its total to more than 6,000 miles.
   ``We found some difficulty in selling to major corporations when
you really don't own and control your own network,'' Wilkens said.
``It's a very real advantage. A lot of people say 40 percent of all
communications traffic comes into and goes out of New York.''
   WTG boasts it is the first network to offer highly reliable
fiber-optic communications capability from New York to Los Angeles
and San Francisco.
   Wilkens said it means his company has joined the big leagues with
American Telephone & Telegraph Co, MCI Communications Corp. and U.S.
Sprint Communications Corp.
   ``We, all of a sudden within 36 to 40 months, have gone from the
point of `Let's see if we can get into this business' to being the
fourth network,'' Wilkens said from the company's new high-tech,
high-style corporate headquarters overlooking downtown Tulsa.
   WTG sells capacity both to other communications companies and to
private businesses, but plans to expand its commercial sales efforts.
   ``Of the Fortune 2,000 companies, we're into half of them. Of the
Fortune 100 companies, we're into half of them,'' Wilkens said.
``For a little Tulsa company to go into those major corporations and
to sell them services is not an easy task.
   ``Almost every single major carrier in the country uses us, with
the exception of AT&T,'' Wilkens said. ``And if you look at most of
their network maps and the marketing literature that they put out,
they show their fiber-optic network, which is our fiber-optic
network.''
   Wilkens said his company had a leg up on the industry because it
knew how to build underground pipelines across country. It was
familiar with the environmental restrictions, the negotiations for
right-of-way, and the need to avoid areas where construction
activity could cause line breaks.
   Earlier this year, WTG opened a futuristic $2.4 million control
center in Tulsa that monitors 11,000 miles of fiber lines for a
five-member consortium called the National Telecommunications
Network.
   The customized system provides constant information about the
performance of the network and its dozens of repeater stations. The
center keeps in constant contact with a force of 200 technicians who
patrol the lines.
   Wilkens said the company is proud of its reliability, which
approaches 99.999 percent.
   ``That's one way we're trying to differentiate ourselves in the
marketplace,'' Wilkens said.
   Reliability is crucial for customers who count on digital
telecommunications to do banking, schedule airline flights, operate
car telephones, order catalog merchandise and dispatch truckers
cross-country.
   Wilkens said competition following the breakup of AT&T has made
it all possible.
   ``I think if the industry stayed regulated the way it was, there
was no big need to try to develop technologically the revolution
that we're seeing, the information society, the information age,''
Wilkens said.

   Stock in Financial News Network soared Thursday
after a published report said Dow Jones & Co. was seeking a stake in
the cable television service.
   USA Today reported that Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall
Street Journal, was interested in buying the 45 percent stake in FNN
owned by Infotechnology Inc., also known as Infotech, a New
York-based media company.
   FNN stock was sharply higher in over-the-counter trading Thursday
afternoon, rising $1.87{ to $8.62{.
   However, Infotech Chairman Earl Brian, who is also chairman of
United Press International, denied the USA Today report, saying, ``I
have no plans to sell the block of stock.''
   A spokesman for Dow Jones, Jim Ambrosio, said he could not
comment on the USA Today report.
   Brian said FNN has been discussing joint programming ventures
with a number of large media companies, but he declined to say
whether Dow Jones was among them.
   ``We don't comment on who we're talking to, simply because we're
talking to a lot of people,'' he said.
   The USA Today report also said Dow Jones was discussing producing
business shows with FNN. Dow Jones already is involved in broadcast
ventures, including the syndicated Wall Street Journal Report.
   FNN provides 18 hours of business news each weekday, as well as
sports and home shopping programming.
   Infotech's other subsidiaries include Data Broadcasting Corp.;
Questech Capital Corp.; TV Value Mart Corp.; and Comtex Scientific
Corp.

   The U.S. dollar fell in narrow, quiet European
trading Thursday as markets wound down for the year. Gold prices
were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar remained stable, with
firm U.S. interest rates continuing to hold the currency at
relatively high levels.
   They said trading was extremely quiet, even stagnant, as many
market players and dealers remained on vacation between Christmas
and New Year's holidays.
   A dealer said a steep decline in the dollar at the beginning of
the Frankfurt session was more a reflection of thin seasonal trading
than any market bearishness.
   Little dollar movement was also expected on Friday, the last
trading day of the year.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.76 yen to a closing 126.03. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 125.80 yen.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.7900, unchanged from Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Wednesday's prices,
1.7875 West German marks, down from 1.7960; 1.5125 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5177; 6.0975 French francs, down from 6.1225; 2.0190
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0255; 1,314.50 Italian lire, down from
1,320.90; and 1.19225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1963.
   In London, gold traded at a late bid price of $408.25 a troy
ounce, down from $413.95 late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was $410.75, down from $412.25 bid
late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.38 to close at a bid $416.07
a troy ounce.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.04 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $6.07.

<HEAD>November Construction Contracts Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release after 6 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of new construction contracts rose in
November, with the bulk of the increase from non-residential
building projects, a business-research company reported Thursday.
   The F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co. said
that new construction projects were up 3 percent last month over
October to an annualized value of $246.7 billion. Construction
contracts rose 1 percent in October following three straight monthly
declines.
   Setting the pace for the November increase was the
non-residential building sector, which rose a seasonally adjusted 7
percent to an annualized value of $80.9 billion, the report said.
   Newly started housing was up 4 percent to an annualized value of
$126.0 billion, with continued strength in one-family houses, it
said.
   Non-building construction, which includes public works and
utility projects, declined 9 percent to an annualized value of $39.8
billion, the report said.
   ``Although November's contracting was helped by a rare spurt of
office building, it has been the consistency of demand for single
family homes that has been the main support of the construction
sector throughout 1988,'' said George A. Christie, a McGraw-Hill
economist.
   ``Until the expected rise of mortgage rates materializes,
homebuilding is making the difference between a sharp decline and a
gentle letdown from last year's peak of total construction
activity.''
   For the first 11 months, new construction starts on an unadjusted
basis totaled $233.4 billion, down 2 percent from the same period in
1987, the report said.
   The West, with a 2 percent rise over last year, was the only
major region to show a gain in 1988. The South and the Northeast had
11 month declines of 5 percent and 4 percent respectively, according
to the report.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge presiding over a rate-hike suit
against the Long Island Lighting Co. issued an order Thursday
temporarily barring the financially shaky utility from paying
dividends to shareholders.
   Company spokesman Joseph McDonnell sought to minimize the impact
of the order, saying the company had not paid dividends since 1984.
He said Lilco had no immediate plans to resume payments.
   The temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge
Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn is in effect until next Wednesday when
Weinstein has scheduled a hearing for Lilco to argue why it should
be lifted.
   Weinstein is seeking a settlement of Suffolk County's successful
civil racketeering suit against Lilco, an accord that could possibly
include closing the controversial Shoreham nuclear power plant in
the Long Island county.
   Closed negotiations have been held for about two weeks.
   A jury earlier this month found that the utility had lied to
state officials about the progress of the Shoreham plant to obtain
rate increases in 1978 and 1984. The jury awarded $22.8 million in
damages to Suffolk.
   ``I think this is really the judge trying to assert his authority
and to show everybody how tough he's going to be and to force the
parties to negotiate a settlement to this whole thing,'' said Barry
Abramson, a senior utilities analyst with Prudential-Bache.
   Abramson downplayed the effect the order may have on Wall Street.
   ``The actual order is not significant in my opinion because Lilco
couldn't pay the dividends anyway,'' he said. ``I think that LILCO
has no ability and no desire to pay any dividends in the short run.''
   The restraining order was issued in response to a request by
Judith Vladeck, an attorney representing ratepayers.
   In Albany on Wednesday, the state Public Service Commission
denied Lilco's request for an immediate 5.4 percent rate increase
and said it would reconsider the utility's request again on Jan. 25.

   Domino's Pizza owner Tom Monaghan
wants to help the 500 residents of this bucolic island make some
dough, and he's not just talking pizza.
   Monaghan, who owns a vacation home and corporate retreat on the
island, plans to create a bank to serve residents, a spokesman said.
The island has a credit union but no commercial bank, aide Dick
Brunvand said Wednesday.
   The entrepreneur will apply next month with the state and hopes
to open the bank by mid-1989, Brunvand said. Monaghan, who also owns
the Detroit Tigers baseball team, expects to be chairman of the bank.
   Monaghan owns 1,700 acres on the island off the eastern tip of
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The land is mainly used as a vacation
spot for Domino's employees and includes a golf course and compound
for three orphaned bear cubs.
   The pizza magnate is dredging the harbor to make room for his
sailing ship, the Domino Effect.

   Eastman Kodak Co. has announced plans for
price increases for nearly all consumer and professional films, as
well as photographic papers and chemicals.
   The increases, announced Thursday, will be effective with orders
beginning January 26, 1989 and are publicized in catalog inserts now
in the mail to dealers.
   ``It's a fairly modest increase,'' said company spokesman Ron
Roberts. ``The increase reflects the general cost of doing business.
It's reasonably normal and not unexpected for January.''
   Roberts said amateur films will increase 3.5 percent, with the
exception of Kodachrome 25 film and Kodachrome 64 film, which will
increase 7 percent.
   The price increases will also affect two camera models: the K40
will increase $3 and the Mickey-Matic will go up $1. Prices on all
Carousel slide projectors are being increased by 4 percent.
   Price increases for professional film will range from 2 to 6
percent. Color papers for photofinishers will rise 3 percent, while
chemical prices will see an average upswing of 3.5 percent,
according to Roberts.

   The stock market advanced broadly today, sending
its best-known index above its highest closing level of the year in
a rally that analysts attributed to year-end bargain hunting.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 3.75 points
on Wednesday, was up 17.50 at 2,183.93 with two hours left in the
session.
   The Dow Jones industrial average's highest close this year was
2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21.
   Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of 2 to 1 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 949 up, 482 down
and 513 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 93.92 million shares at 2 p.m. on
Wall Street compared with 79.38 million shares at the same point
Wednesday.
   Analysts said year-end bargain hunting was putting some upward
pressure on prices. They said the gains reflects efforts by some
institutional investors to spruce up their end-of-year portfolios by
adding some top-quality issues.
   ``With the market near its highs for the year, the large cash
position that some money managers find themselves with is
embarrassing,'' said Newton D. Zinder, senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   He said the gains today also reflected some confidence in the
stock market to hold its ground despite rising interest rates
earlier in the week.
   Yields on some short-term Treasury issues, for instance, have
risen above 9 percent and pose competition for the uncertain returns
on stocks.
   In the credit markets today, prices edged higher and yields
slipped.

<HEAD>Report Says Consumer Inflation To Rise In 1989</HEAD>

   Americans should expect to pay more to dress up,
gas up, light up and eat out in 1989, but staying in will probably
cost less, according to a report released Thursday by Standard &
Poor's Corp.
   In its annual forecast, the business-information concern
predicted moderate inflation for next year, with consumer prices
rising between 4.5 percent and 5 percent. That compares with an
increase of around 4.25 percent this year.
   The survey said that prices on new clothing are expected to be
between 5 percent and 10 percent higher in 1989, while the cost of
cigarettes should jump around 10 percent.
   Among its other findings:
   _Eating or and going to the movies should cost 3 percent to 5
percent more.
   _Insurance premiums for homeowners should rise 7 percent to 10
percent.
   _Gasoline should cost about 5 cents more a gallon.
   _Food, in general, should rise about 4 percent.
   _Prices for videocassettes and compact discs should decline.
   _Electricity and home furnishings should hold steady.
   ``The Federal Reserve's renewed efforts to contain price
increases by boosting interest rates will help keep a lid on
inflation for the time being,'' said David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief
economist.
   ``However, while the current inflation rate is moderate and
certainly tolerable, it is creeping upward.''
   Blitzer noted that unemployment remains at a 14-year low and
business capacity utilization is on the rise, two factors that could
rekindle higher inflation unless economic policy changes are made.

   Grain and soybean futures closed little changed
Thursday in the last full session of the year on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   The exchange, like most other U.S. futures exchanges, will close
at noon local time Friday and reopen on Tuesday.
   Many analysts had expected strong gains in the grain markets
following the Agriculture Department's confirmation after
Wednesday's close of large purchases of corn and soybean meal by the
Soviet Union.
   Cathy Leow, an assistant vice president with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York, said the corn business was expected and
the meal sale was offset by losses in the soybean oil pit.
   ``We've also had a lot of overhead resistance'' to higher soybean
and meal prices,'' she said. ``Once you take out those levels, the
market's going to go like gangbusters but until you breach them,
people are taking a more cautious approach.''
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.36{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 2} cents lower with March at $2.82{ a bushel; oats were { cent to

<HEAD>Bilzerian Arraignment Postponed For A Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover investor Paul Bilzerian, indicted last
week for alleged securities fraud and other charges, will be
arraigned Jan. 5, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office said Thursday.
   Bilzerian was to have been arraigned Thursday, but U.S.
attorney's office spokeswoman Carol Weiss said it was postponed
because of unspecified scheduling conflicts. At an arraignment, a
defendant is formally charged with an offense and can enter a plea.
   The 38-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Fla., has asserted he
is innocent and has blamed the indictment on what he calls
overzealous prosecutors seizing on adverse publicity about hostile
corporate takeovers.
   Bilzerian was indicted Dec. 21 by a federal grand jury in
Manhattan for 12 counts of securities fraud, tax fraud, conspiracy
and making false statements to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The charges stem from an investigation into his unsuccessful
takeover attempts on Hammermill Paper Co., H.H. Robertson Co.,
Cluett, Peabody & Co. and Armco Inc.
   Earlier this year, Bilzerian made his first successful takeover
bid, a $1.06 billion acquisition of the defense contractor Singer Co.
   People familiar with the Bilzerian case have said evidence was
derived partly from disclosures by Boyd Jefferies, a stock trading
professional whose Los Angeles brokerage handled some of Bilzerian's
transactions.
   Jefferies has been cooperating with a government probe into
financial fraud since early 1987, when he was implicated by Ivan F.
Boesky, the insider trader now serving a three-year prison term for
securities fraud.

   Assets of the nation's 456 money market mutual
funds fell $244.9 million in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $278.48 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $2.03 billion drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $281.89 billion in the week
ended Nov. 23, 1988.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 228 general purpose funds rose $13.3 million to $89.70
billion, assets of 92 broker-dealer funds fell $400.8 million to
$116.96 billion, and assets of 136 institutional funds rose $142.6
million to $71.82 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.18 percent from 8.09 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.01 percent from 7.91 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 32
days, down from 34 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.20 percent as of Wednesday from 6.18 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.18
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.16 the
previous week. Yields were 8.44 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.43
percent; 8.55 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged from a week earler;
and 8.70 percent on 5-year CDs, also unchanged.

   The dollar ended lower against most major
currencies in thin, volatile trading Thursday.
   Gold prices also declined, in what dealers ascribed to yearend
book-squaring. Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion
was bid at $408.40 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $5.10 from
late Wednesday.
   Dealers said the dollar started out strong with the help of
firmer U.S. interest rates and yearend corporate demand for dollars,
but it retreated after the West German Bundesbank reportedly
intervened to stem the currency's rise.
   Trading, though, was described as extremely thin prior to the New
Year's Day holiday, exaggerating the impact of even the slightest
price movements.
   Little dollar movement was expected on Friday, the last trading
day of the year, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.76 yen to a closing 126.03. It was quoted at
125.80 yen in London. Later, in New York, it stood at 125.625 yen,
down from 125.68 late Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7900, unchanged from
Wednesday. Sterling fetched $1.7905 in New York, up from $1.7885.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7875 West German marks, down from 1.7905; 1.5140
Swiss francs, up from 1.5135; 6.0965 French francs, down from
6.1115; 1.19205 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1929; and 1,315.00
Italian lire, down from 1,317.75.
   Late dollar rates in London, compared with Wednesday: 1.7875 West
German marks, down from 1.7960; 1.5125 Swiss francs, down from

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
closed at $408.20 a troy ounce, down from $413.90 late Wednesday.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $408.25 an ounce,
down from $413.95 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the late bid price was
$410.75, down from $412.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.38 to close at a bid $416.07
an ounce.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver closed at
$5.998 a troy ounce, down from $6.088 Wednesday. Silver was quoted
in London at a bid price of $6.04 an ounce, down from Wednesday's
$6.07.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc. said Thursday that it has completed
the sale of its Londontown Corp. subsidiary to Eldersberg
Acquisition Corp. for $178 million in cash.
   Eldersberg Acquisition is comprised of a group organized by
senior management personnel of Londontown.
   Londontown, based in Eldersberg, Md., manufactures London Fog
rainwear.
   The sale was part of a defensive restructuring program announced
earlier this year by Interco to contest a hostile takeover bid by
brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales of Washington, D.C. The takeover
bid failed earlier this month.
   Interco has estimated that costs associated with the
restructuring will exceed $65 million. The company plans to sell off
all but its Converse Inc. and Florsheim Shoe Co. subsidiaries,
Broyhill Furniture Industries Inc. and Lane Co. furniture companies
and possibly the Central Hardware home-improvement stores.
   The sale of Londontown leaves Interco with 10 apparel companies,
five retail stores, four footwear companies and four furniture
companies.
   On Wednesday, Interco turned down a $190 million cash offer for
Londontown from Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Inc.
   The St. Louis-based Interco said the proposal did not meet its
requirements of an assured, timely closing, and that uncertainties
surrounding the Burlington proposal and the risks of any delay could
harm the business of Londontown.

<HEAD>US Probes Complaint of Unfair Practice by EEC In Copper Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has started an investigation
into complaints that Britain and other European countries unfairly
restrict imports of American copper scrap, the government announced
Wednesday.
   If the investigation and proposed mediation efforts fail to
resolve the dispute within 18 months, the United States can then
retaliate against the Europeans.
   In accordance with procedures for investigating such complaints,
the U.S. Trade Representative has asked European Economic Community
to agree to consultations.
   If consultations with the Europeans fail to yield satisfactory
results, said USTR spokesman Cary Walker, the United States will
take its case to international arbitration.
   The investigation comes at a time of strained relations between
the United States and the EEC over a ban which the Europeans plan to
implement Jan. 1 on U.S. meat treated with hormones. The United
States plans to retaliate against the Europeans with 100 percent
duties on a variety of imported foods and beverages.
   Walker said the copper scrap investigation is not related in any
way to the hormone dispute. The petition was filed on Nov. 14, and
by law the USTR had to respond within 45 days, he said.
   The Copper and Brass Fabricators Council, which represents
American manufacturers, contends its members lose $180 million
annually in revenues because of quotas set by the Europeans.
   Copper scrap is used to make such products as door knobs, brass
lamps and guard rails.
   Since September 1985, the United States has accepted 65 to 70
petitions of complaint from U.S. manufacturers against foreign
competitors, and acted on 27 either through international mediation
or retaliation.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Dec. 19, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,065.8 billion from $3.066.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, decreased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,902.8 billion from $3,905.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $785.5 billion from a revised $787.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual
growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $720 million,
compared with a decline of $445 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $285.3 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from
$284.9 billion two weeks earlier.

   The Palais Royal transaction will provide about $90 million to
the shareholders plus other considerations, said Moselle Pollack,
chairman of Palais Royal.
   ``The purpose of this sale is to ensure the continuation of those
successful methods that have been utilized in the past, and to
foster the growth of our fine retail establishment in the future,''
Mrs. Pollack said.
   Bealls was founded as a partnership in Henderson, Texas, in 1923
by brothers Robbie and Archie Beall. Three months later, their
brother W.F. ``Willie'' Beall joined the family partnership, and
served as the company's president until his death in 1953.
   Terms of the Bealls transaction weren't disclosed.
   Josh Bekenstein, a partner of Bain Capital, said the combination
of Palais Royal with Bealls creates a quality fashion retailer of
significant magnitude for the Southwest.
   The Palais Royal acquisition received heavy publicity because
Moselle Pollack is the wife of a Manhattan federal judge Milton
Pollack, who has been presiding over a civil fraud case by the
Securities and Exchange Commission against Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., which helped finance the deal.
   Drexel had argued that its indirect financial relationship with
the judge should have compelled him to quit the case, which remains
stalled over the issue of his impartiality.
   The outcome of the civil case has been clouded further by
Drexel's agreement last week to plead guilty to six felony counts
and pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle a
criminal securities fraud probe.
   That agreement with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is
contingent on Drexel's settlement of the SEC civil charges.

<HEAD>Heated Demand Pushes Coffee Futures To 25-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices surged to their highest levels in more than
two years Thursday on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange amid
strong demand for tight supplies of green, unroasted coffee beans.
   On other markets, in uniformly light, pre-holiday trading, gold,
silver and energy futures retreated; grains and soybeans were mixed;
livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   Thursday marked the last full day of trading this year on most
U.S. futures markets. Most markets will close at noon local time
Friday and reopen on Tuesday.
   Coffee settled 3.80 cents to 6.94 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $1.5898 a pound. During the session, the
March contract traded as high as $1.596 a pound, the highest coffee
futures price since Nov. 14, 1986.
   Poor growing and harvesting conditions in Central and South
America have cut deeply into the availability of green coffee,
forcing U.S. roasters to pay higher prices to obtain supplies for
the winter months, when coffee consumption reaches its annual peak.
   The recent, rapid rise in prices _ a gain of more than 30 cents a
pound since Dec. 1 _ has also prompted roasters to buy March coffee
futures as a hedge against futher price increases on the cash
market, analysts said.
   Bert Ruiz, a coffee broker with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New
York, said the widening price gap between the March and May coffee
contracts indicated that demand for near-term supplies was
continuing to grow. The March contract's price rose by nearly 7
cents a pound Wednesday while May deliveries advanced by just over
4.8 cents.
   ``This is a demand-driven market,'' Ruiz said. ``Roasters are
flocking to March and selling May because they believe there's going
to be an acute tightness of quality beans in March, whereby by May
it should be relieved.''
   The tight-supply situation should ease during the second quarter
of 1989 as more newly harvested beans reach the market and
consumption begins a seasonal decline, he said.
   Platinum futures prices rebounded after hitting resistance near
$500 a troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange but gold and
silver futures posted significant losses on New York's Commodity
Exchange.,
   Rumors that the Soviet Union would sell physical gold to pay for
new grain purchases kept the gold and silver markets under pressure
although trading volume was extremely thin, said John O'Connell,
manager of futures research for Refco Inc. in New York.
   Platinum settled $1.30 to $4.30 higher with January at $514.30 a
troy ounce; gold was $6.10 to $8 lower with February at $415.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 9.1 cents to 10 cents lower with March at
$609.3 cents a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices fell moderately on the New York Mercantile
Exchange amid profit-taking and book-squaring ahead of the New
Year's weekend, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 23 cents
lower with February at $16.77 a barrel; heating oil was .69 cent to
.83 cent lower with January at 52.77 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .03 cent to .60 cent lower with January at 47.01 cents
a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures were little changed on the Chicago
Board of Trade despite a surge in sales of U.S. wheat, corn and
soybean meal to the Soviet Union.
   The corn and wheat business had been expected and a
600,000-metric ton meal sale was offset by losses in the soybean oil
pit, said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice president with Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York,
   Wheat settled 1\ cents lower to 1\ cent higher with March at
$4.36} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with March at
$2.82{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ cents higher with March at
$2.39{ a bushel; soybeans were } cent to 5\ cents lower with January
at $7.88} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures ended narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on position-evening ahead of the long weekend,
analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .07 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
February at 73.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with January at 84.15 cents a pound; live hogs
were .15 cent to .32 cent lower with February at 46.82 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher
with February at 43.12 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures made moderate gains on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 1.75 points higher at 282.10. Each point is
worth $500.

   A year-end search for bargains among blue-chip
issues propelled stock prices to a broad rally on Thursday that left
the market's best-known gauge only a shade below its highest closing
level this year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which gained 3.75 points
on Wednesday, climbed another 16.25 to close at 2,182.68.
   That was less than a point below its 1988 closing high of
2,183.50 reached on Oct. 21, which also was the highest close since
the October 1987 crash.
   At mid-afternoon, the blue-chip index was slightly above the
year's high closing mark but it lost some ground by the end of the
session.
   As the market heads into its final trading session of the year,
the Dow Jones industrial average is about 12.6 percent above its
1987 close of 1,938.83.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
987 up, 477 down and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 131.29 million
shares, up from 110.63 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 160.14 million shares.
   Analysts said year-end bargain hunting was mainly responsible for
boosting prices.
   Michael Metz, market analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., said
most of the institutional investors who wanted to sell have already
done so. ``So when you get some nibbling by bargain-hunters, it is
easy to lift (the Dow Jones industrial average) with no supply
around,'' he said.
   The analysts said the gains also reflected efforts by some
institutional investors to spruce up their end-of-year portfolios or
put some excess cash to work by adding some top-quality issues.
   ``With the market near its highs for the year, the large cash
position that some money managers find themselves with is
embarrassing,'' said Newton D. Zinder, senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   He said the gains also demonstrated relief that the stock market
held its ground earlier this week despite rising interest rates.
   Yields on some short-term Treasury issues, for instance, have
risen above 9 percent and pose increasing competition for the
uncertain returns on stocks.
   In the credit markets Thursday, prices and yields were fairly
stable.
   ``The view is that the Fed will not raise the discount rate right
away,'' said Oppenheimer's Metz. The discount rate is the Federal
Reserve's interest charge on loans to financial institutions.
   Among the active issues on the NYSE, SCECorp rose \ to 32],
Navistar rose \ to 5\ and Pepsico rose ~ to 39~.
   Quantum Chemical, which rose 18| on Wednesday after announcing a
restructuring plan, rose [ to 107\.
   Metz said Quantum's plan appeared to draw attention to the values
in several basic industrial groups, such as steel, forest prodcucts
and chemicals, and contributed to rises in those areas on Thursday.
   Fluor rose ~ to 23|, Dow Chemical rose 1{ to 88, Monsanto rose }
to 83, International Paper was up 1 to 46[, Louisiana Pacific added
\ to 28|, Bethlehem Steel rose | to 23~ and USX gained { to 29|.
   International Business Machines rose } to 123\. Also in the
technolgy group, Digital Equipment rose 1| to 98}, Data General

   In over-the-counter trading, Financial News Network rose 1| to 8]
on speculation that someone may be interested in acquiring a stake
in the business, sports and shopping service.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $18.29 billion, or 0.67
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.09 to 156.90.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 2.89 to 323.38, and S&P's
500-stock composite index rose 2.32 to 279.40.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.29 to 379.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 303.69, up 1.55.

   A federal judge lifted a restraining order
preventing the Long Island Lighting Co. from paying stock dividends
after the financially shaky utility agreed Thursday to notify the
court 10 days before issuing any dividends.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who is presiding over the
rate-hike suit against LILCO, issued the restraining order in the
morning, but lifted it seven hours later.
   Shortly after the order was signed, a company spokesman minimized
its impact, saying the company had not paid dividends since 1984 and
had no immediate plans to resume payments.
   Weinstein scheduled a hearing on the issue for next Wednesday.
   The judge is seeking a settlement of Suffolk County's successful
civil racketeering suit against LILCO, an accord that could possibly
include closing the controversial Shoreham nuclear power plant.
   Closed negotiations have been ongoing for about two weeks.
   A jury earlier this month found that the utility had lied to
state officials about the progress of the Shoreham plant to obtain
rate increases in 1978 and 1984. The jury awarded $22.8 million in
damages to Suffolk.
   Weinstein must now decide whether to certify a class of
ratepayers in the suit, making LILCO liable for at least $4 billion.
   ``I think this is really the judge trying to assert his authority
and to show everybody how tough he's going to be and to force the
parties to negotiate a settlement to this whole thing,'' said Barry
Abramson, a senior utilities analyst with Prudential-Bache.
   Abramson downplayed the effect the temporary order would have on
Wall Street.
   ``The actual order is not significant in my opinion because LILCO
couldn't pay the dividends anyway,'' he said. ``I think that LILCO
has no ability and no desire to pay any dividends in the short run.''
   On Thursday, LILCO closed at $13 per share on the New York Stock
Exchange, up 25 cents.
   The restraining order was issued in response to a request by
Judith Vladeck, the attorney representing the proposed class of
ratepayers. said these payments would total about $1 billion.
   ``In view of LILCO's limited net worth, payment of such dividends
... would severely reduce LILCO's ability to pay a judgement awarded
to the proposed plaintiff class,'' she wrote in an affidavit. ``It
would further severely impair the likelihood of achieving a fair and
reasonable settlement on behalf of the plaintiff class.''
   In Albany on Wednesday, the state Public Service Commission
denied LILCO's request for an immediate 5.4 percent rate increase
and said it would reconsider the utility's request again on Jan. 25.

   Owners of 1988 Pontiac LeMans automobiles are
being urged by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to
have their cars checked for defective safety belt buckles,
administrators said Thursday.
   NHTSA Administrator Diane K. Steed said General Motors Corp.
recalled 85,000 model year 1988 Pontiac LeMans vehicles to correct
the problem.
   The defective buckles could appear to be latched when in fact
they are not, NHTSA said in a Thursday news release.
   ``Safety belts are the most important safety equipment in a car
and more Americans than ever before _ 46 percent _ now use them,''
Steed said. ``Safety belts saved about 4,000 lives in 1987 and if
everyone used them every trip, about 15,000 lives could be saved
each year.''

<HEAD>Sale of Puerto Rico TV Stations Final</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lorimar Telepictures Corp. said it has
completed the sale of two television stations in Puerto Rico in a
deal the TV production company says removes a major obstacle to its
$1.2 billion merger with Warner Communications Inc.
   Lorimar, producer of ``Dallas,'' ``Alf'' and other TV series,
said Thursday it sold WLII-TV in San Juan and WSUR-TV in Ponce to a
Florida investment group headed by Timothy Brumlik of Orlando, Fla.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   Lorimar's ownership of the Puerto Rican stations and of WPGH-TV
in Pittsburgh had stymied New York-based Warner's plan to buy
Lorimar for approximately $1.2 billion in stock.
   Warner's biggest shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries Inc., got a
court order in August blocking the deal on grounds it violated a
1984 agreement signed when Warner and Chris-Craft bought shares in
each other. The agreement, which gave Warner 42.5 percent of
Chris-Craft's BHC Inc. television subsidiary, barred Warner from
owning other television stations.
   Lorimar owned six stations when it agreed to merge with Warner.
Sale of the Puerto Rican stations leaves only WPGH, and the company
has reached an agreement in principle to sell that to Renaissance
Communications, organized by investor Michael Finkelstein and
Warburg Pincus Capital.
   The Warner buyout is expected to be consummated in January,
Lorimar said in a news release, apparently indicating sale of the
Pittsburgh station will be completed by then.
   A call to Chris-Craft's New York offices late Thursday was not
returned.

   Federal regulators, working against a year-end
tax deadline, announced the sale of 13 more insolvent savings and
loan institutions in Texas and Illinois on Thursday.
   The latest deals brought to 197 the number of insolvent S&Ls
which have been dealt with by federal officials this year, a
post-Depression record, far surpassing the 48 S&Ls closed in 1987.
   Officials predicted that they are sure to top the target of
dealing with 200 failed S&Ls this year before a midnight deadline
Saturday, when tax breaks for the buyers of ailing S&Ls will be cut
in half.
   The latest takeovers included the first purchase of Texas
institutions by foreigners. A group of investors from Taiwan agreed
to buy eight insolvent Texas institutions.
   The latest deals followed two of the largest bailouts of S&Ls.
The government announced Wednesday it was pledging assistance
totaling $6.8 billion to the purchasers of a huge California
institution and five of the most financially troubled Texas S&Ls.
   The agreements Thursday were announced after the three-member
Federal Home Loan Bank Board spent the day huddled behind closed
doors reviewing offers.
   In one of the deals, eight insolvent Texas S&Ls were sold to
Pacific USA Holdings Corp., a Texas subsidiary of a Taiwanese
company, which agreed to invest $37.5 million to purchase the S&Ls.
The branches will be operated under the name Pacific Southwest
Savings Bank F.S.B., headquartered in Corpus Christi.
   The bank board agreed to provide $566.2 million in government
assistance to the purchasers.
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall hailed the sale to the
Taiwanese investors, saying, ``We welcome our first non-U.S. owned
investor to the Southwest Plan (the program for dealing with sick
S&Ls in Texas). Their interest in investing in the future of Texas
is a further indication of the attractiveness of the state's thrift
industry as well as it's business climate, which is what we've been
saying all along.''
   The S&Ls being purchased were Charter Savings and Loan of Corpus
Christi; Keystone Savings and Loan of Lampasas; Bayview Federal
Savings Association of Corpus Christi; First Federal Savings and
Loan of Luling; Independence Savings and Loan of Gonzales; Yoakum
Federal Savings and Loan of Yoakum; Union Savings Association of San
Antonio; and Sequin Savings Association of Sequin.
   A second sale involved four insolvent Texas thrifts, which were
purchased by the Centex Corp., a Dallas home builder, who will
operate the former branches as Texas Trust Savings Bank F.S.B. In
that transaction, the bank board will provide $429 million in
government assistance and Centex will invest $26.5 million.
   The insolvent S&Ls purchased by Centex were Burnet Savings and
Loan of Burnet; Lee Savings Association of Giddings; Ranchers
Savings Association of Johnson City; and Peoples Savings and Loan of
Llano.
   The third deal involved the sale of American Savings Bank of
Springfield, Ill., at a cost to the government of $187.9 million.
The insolvent S&L was being taken over by Citizens Federal Bank of
Miami, which will operate American's 23 offices as branches of
Citizens Federal. Citizens Federal is investing no money in the deal.
   Federal regulators faced new criticism on Thursday about their
year-end rush to close insolvent S&Ls, but they continued to insist
that the cost to the government of simply closing the institutions
and paying off depositors would far exceed the sales being arranged
which use tax breaks and direct federal assistance as a lure for
private investors.
   The tax benefits will be effectively cut in half after midnight
Saturday. The provisions that will expire allow firms who purchased
failed S&Ls to deduct the previous losses of those associations from
profits the firms earned on other operations.
   In virtually all of transactions completed in 1988, the firms
taking over the S&Ls will qualify for tax breaks that will far
exceed what they are paying for the institutions.
   Congressional critics have questioned these tax benefits,
contending that the bank board is rushing the sales through without
a proper analysis of the revenue loss to the federal government.
   In a letter to Wall, Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn. and the new
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said ``I have serious
questions about the impact your plans will have on the federal
budget, the competitive balance of the remaining thrift industry and
the concentration of power without our financial systems.''
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas and the new chairman of the House
Banking Committee, said he plans to hold a series of hearings,
looking especially at the two largest bailouts announced this week
involving $6.8 billion in government assistance in the sale of a
California S&L to Texas billionaire Robert Bass and the purchase of
five deeply troubled Texas S&Ls by a group headed by Revlon
cosmetics chairman Ronald Perelman.
   ``All of the bank board's eleventh-hour deals will be reviewed by
the House Banking Committee,'' he said in a statement. ``We will be
looking at whether the bank board has been getting the best deals
possible.''
   Wall called the Bass purchase ``a major achievement of an
extremely eventful 1988'' because it took off the government's hands
American Savings of Stockton, Calif., the country's largest
insolvent S&L.
   Congress and the incoming Bush administration will be looking for
ways to finance the remaining 400 insolvent S&Ls. Estimates of the
total cost to the government of resolving the S&L mess range from
$50 billion to $112 billion with even the low figure certain to
swell the federal budget deficit.
   Industry losses from the insolvent institutions are mounting by
$1 billion a month.
   For this reason, analysts said, President-elect Bush cannot
afford to delay dealing with the problem. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, who is remaining in his job in the new
administration, has already launched a study to find ways to finance
the rescue effort.
   ``The Bush administration will be committing political suicide if
it doesn't candidly address this problem immediately after taking
office,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria,
Va.
   All of the S&Ls being taken over this week have been insolvent
for several years but have been kept open because the government's
insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., did
not have enough cash to pay off depositors and shut the institutions
down.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Files Suit Against Centaur Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennwalt escalated efforts Thursday to
prevent a hostile takeover by filing a federal lawsuit accusing
Centaur Partners of violating securities laws in a recent tender
offer.
   The suit seeks an injunction against Centaur's $765 million
offer, which was filed Dec. 13 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   A news statement released Thursday night named PaineWebber as an
undisclosed joint partner with Centaur.
   The statement said the lawsuit ``demands among other things that
Centaur and its affiliates correct the false and misleading
statements in the tender offer materials.''
   The statement did not include details of Pennwalt's allegations.
A Pennwalt spokeswoman, Sue S. Kinard, said Thursday night that she
had not read the suit and could not comment.
   She referred all questions to Matt Broderick, of the
Philadelphia-based law firm, Dechart, Price and Rhoads. Broderick
did not return a telephone call from The Associated Press Thursday
night.
   Pennwalt's board of directors on Tuesday called Centaur's
$100-per-share offer ``completely unacceptable.''
   Officials of Centaur, an investment partnership, have said they
will continue to press ahead with the takeover bid and want to meet
with Pennwalt executives to discuss a friendly merger. Pennwalt has
said no meeting will occur.
   In a letter to Pennwalt shareholders, Chairman Edwin R. Tuttle
called Centaur's offer ``illusory'' and said it was not intended to
succeed.
   Centaur, whose principals are New York financiers Abbey J. Butler
and Melvyn J. Estrin, owns 12.7 percent of the chemical maker's
outstanding shares.
   Pennwalt closed Thursday at 103] on the New York Stock Exchange,

   A group of Dallas Times Herald employees filed suit
Thursday in U.S. district court against the newspaper's former
owner, Times Mirror Co., for failing to comply with terms of the
company pension plan and refusing to terminate the plan and
distribute its assets.
   The suit says Times Mirror, the Los Angeles-based media group
that owned the Times Herald from 1969 to 1986, signed an agreement
not to terminate or amend the pension plan at the time of its sale
in 1986 to a media company led by William Dean Singleton.
   The suit asks the court to stop a proposed merger of the plan and
to distribute its assets to participants.
   About 800 current and former Times Herald employees are covered
in the plan. The plaintiffs _ current and former Times Herald
employees Ron Calhoun, Helen Connor, Charles Dameron, C.D. Fletcher,
Jim Henderson and Carolyn Robinson _ represent those covered in the
plan.
   The suit says Times Mirror wants to take $15 million of the $27
million in the pension plan for its own use, despite the fact that
it has contributed less than $1 million to it for 19 years.
   Times Mirror kept control of the plan after selling the paper to
Singleton. It attempted to terminate the plan for the first time in
July 1986, then again last April.
   In August, Times Mirror filed formal notice to terminate the plan
and take excess funds of about $15 million but withdrew the notice
after being notified that the plan participants claimed all excess
assets.
   In November, Times Mirror filed notice to merge the plan with
another employee benefits plan it controls. It withdrew that notice
Dec. 23 after receiving numerous complaints from participants.
   Times Mirror referred all comment to Dallas lawyer Thomas
Craddock, who could not be contacted late Thursday.

<HEAD>Pepperidge Farm To Remove Tropical Oils From Crackers, Cookies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepperidge Farm Inc., prompted by what it
called ``strong consumer concern,'' has announced plans to remove a
coconut oil from its crackers and cookies by next summer.
   Officials of the Norwalk-based company said the oil will be
removed from such products as the popular ``Original Goldfish.''
Coconut oil is a saturated fat that raises the cholesterol level.
   People who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher risk of a
clogging of the arteries that can lead to heart attacks.
   ``We must find oils that will proximate tropical oils in terms of
performance in the baking process, flavor, texture, mouth-feel and
shelf-life stability,'' Richard A. Shea, president of Pepperidge
Farm, said in a prepared statement issued Wednesday.
   Phil Sokolof, founder of National Heart Savers, a Nebraska
organization that has campaigned against products which use tropical
oils, such as palm and coconut, said he was pleased by Pepperidge
Farms' decision to remove coconut oil from more than 50 brands of
cookies and crackers.
   ``Ultimately Pepperidge Farms will have saved thousands of
lives,'' Sokolof said. ``They've got a tough job of reformulating
their cookies and crackers.''
   Sokolof said coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat
than lard.
   Coconut and palm oil are popular because they help extend the
shelf life of food products, Sokolof said. Many products advertised
as being free of cholesterol contain tropical oils that can help
cholesterol form after consumption, he said.
   Ann Wainright, a Pepperidge Farm spokeswoman, has said her
company recently began using 100 percent soybean oil in all its
breads.
   Kellogg Co. of Battle Creek, Mich., announced Dec. 12 that it had
stopped using tropical oils in its Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal.
   Sunshine Biscuits Inc. of Woodbridge, N.J. announced Nov. 16 that
it would remove palm oil and palm kernal from its cookie and cracker
products.
   Sokolof, 65, placed advertisments in newspapers in October
depicting nine products he says are portrayed as healthy foods, but
are ''poisoning'' Americans with saturated fats.
   A multimillionaire who nearly died from a heart attack in 1966,
Sokolof has spent $2 million on a crusade to pressure food industry
giants into making healthier products. His father and a
brother-in-law died of heart attacks.

<HEAD>Wheeling-Pitt Files Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: CORRECTS lede to show plan was submitted in Pittsburgh court</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. says it has
submitted its initial plan for reorganization to the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court here.
   A broad outline of the plan, which had been circulated earlier to
the media, said the reorganization would reduce the company's
current common stockholders' ownership to 7 percent.
   Both Wheeling-Pittsburgh and lawyers close to the reorganization,
now nearly four years in progress, said the final plan would likely
look much different than the one submitted Thursday.
   The initial plan is seen as a starting point for negotiations
among the company's creditors, employee groups and stockholders.

   The U.S. dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
in morning trading in Tokyo Friday, the last day of foreign exchange
dealings for 1988.
   The dollar opened at 125.75 yen, down 0.28 yen from Thursday's
close, but moved to 125.93 yen by the end of the morning session.
   Dealers said the dollar weakened in Tokyo following a similar
trend on overseas markets Thursday, where the West German central
bank intervened with dollar-selling to prop up the West German mark.
   A dealer with a major commercial bank in Tokyo described currency
trading as ``very thin'' ahead of a three-day New Year holiday
starting Saturday.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange held its last session for the year on
Wednesday and will reopen on Jan. 4.
