   ``Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach,''
grabbed first place in weekend box office receipts, dislodging
``Good Morning, Vietnam'' after nine weeks at the top and
preventing it from setting a record.
   ``Police Academy 5'' from Warner Bros. earned $6.1 million in
its debut weekend, while Disney-Touchstone's ``Good Morning,
Vietnam,'' earned more than $4 million, falling to second. The
Robin Williams comedy's nine-straight weekends as the most nation's
popular movie equaled the longest consecutive hold on No. 1 set in
1986 by the comedy ``Crocodile Dundee.''
   The latest ``Police Academy'' sequel features the whole wacky
crew in Miami for a police convention.
   Another debut movie, ``D.O.A.'' was third with $3.7 million in
ticket sales. The Disney-Touchstone film stars Dennis Quaid and Meg
Ryan in a remake of the 1949 thriller of the same name. Quaid plays
a poisoned college professor who has 24 hours to find his killer
before he dies.
   Disney-Touchstone has four of the 10-top, while MGM-UA and
Warner Bros. each have two.
   In fourth place was the father-son role switch movie ``Vice
Versa,'' which sold $3 million in tickets, while ``Masquerade,''
about the romance between an heiress and a scheming yachtsman
earned $2.7 million, good for fifth place.
   Cher's ``Moonstruck'' earned $2.3 million for sixth place. Its
writer, John Patrick Shanley, won the Writers Guild of America's
honor for best original screenplay last week. The movie has been
nominated for six Academy Awards.
   ``Three Men and A Baby'' was in seventh place with $2.1 million,
and reached a $150.6 million cumulative gross.
   ``Off Limits,'' a story about two military undercover officers
trying to solve a series of prostitute murders in Saigon during the
Vietnam War, earned $1.58 million for eighth place.
   In ninth was Roman Polanski's ``Frantic'' with $1.50 million,
followed by ``Shoot To Kill,'' with $1.4 million.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in
release, and estimated production costs when available.

   Fourteen-year-old Tiffany Salzer got an ``A'' on her book report
without opening the book. She watched the movie instead.
   ``It only took me three hours to watch the movie and it would
have taken me 12 hours to read the book,'' said the ninth-grader
from Ventura, Calif.
   Her father, Jim, owner of Salzer's Video Store and a board
member of the Video Softwares Dealers Association, is familiar with
the situation.
   ``It's a problem,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``A kid
essentially can rent a classic movie and do a book report from it.
Kids are taking shortcuts.''
   Videotape retailers across the nation say many teen-agers,
children of the television generation, are taking study guides that
summarize literature one step further and turning to videotapes for
help with homework, renting rather than reading.
   Tiffany said her teachers sometimes show movies in class, but
only after students presumably have read the corresponding
literature. She said she watched ``Clan of the Cave Bear'' the
night before a report on the book was due.
   ``The teachers say the movie is different. Sometimes it is, but
students don't really care,'' she said. ``It's better to get a `C'
than an `F.'''
   At parents' requests, Art Marra pulled ``To Kill A Mockingbird''
from the shelves at his HTO Video store in suburban Pittsburgh
after students were assigned to read the book.
   Since then, Marra periodically has refused to rent certain
videotapes to youths because he learned the corresponding books
were homework assignments.
   ``We're a community-oriented shop. We try to give the community
any cooperation we can,'' Marra said.
   Mike Petraglia noticed young people make sporadic runs on
certain films at his Video-O-Video store in Pittsburgh. He said a
popular videotape among teens is ``Dirty Dancing,'' but when
assignments dictate, he can't find enough copies of ``Death of a
Salesman,'' ``Treasure Island,'' ``Grapes of Wrath'' and ``Billy
Budd.''
   ```Gone With the Wind' has been picking up a little bit. I think
it's book-related,'' he said.
   Students always have searched for the easier way, and the video
scholar is just a variation of the Cliff Notes customer, said Scott
Treibitz, spokesman for the American Federation of Teachers, based
in Washington, D.C.
   For 29 years, students have used Cliff Notes to provide
summaries and analysis of books, and sales of the study guides
still are growing, said Doug Lincoln, spokesman for Cliff Notes
Inc. of Lincoln, Neb.
   ``The problem now is with the access of video cassette recorders
and with the access of video stores,'' Treibitz said.
   Lincoln said Cliff Notes may produce its own videotapes, but he
declined to discuss details.
   ``The generation that is in elementary school now, they're
certainly in the video age,'' Lincoln said. ``I would have to say
the (use) of video will probably only increase.''
   Teachers are increasingly using videotapes in the classroom, and
as a supplement the tapes are helpful, said Judi Boren, spokeswoman
for the North Allegheny County School District in suburban
Pittsburgh.
   ``You can't use the video as a Cliff Note kind of crutch,'' Ms.
Boren said. ``There's a saying, `I read the book. I don't need to
see the movie.' If you make some comparisons, maybe you need to do
both.''
   ``A teacher can give a lecture on the Grand Canyon, Niagara
Falls, space exploration,'' Treibitz said. ``A video not only gives
that same material, but shows the visuals to reinforce that
material.
   ``It can't replace reading, it can't replace writing and there
are times it can't replace the lecture,'' he said.

   ``Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach,''
signaled the first success of the spring break movies by kicking
``Good Morning, Vietnam'' out of its long-held No. 1 position in
the weekend national box office.
   ``Police Academy 5'' from Warner Bros. earned $6.1 million at
1,700 screens over the weekend, while Disney-Touchstone's ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' earned more than $4 million and fell to second.
It held first place for nine weeks.

Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan in a remake of the 1949 thriller of the
same name. Quaid plays a fatally poisoned college professor who has
24 hours to find his killer before he dies.
   The arrival of ``D.O.A.'' in the Top 10 list gives
Disney-Touchstone four of the films on the list, while MGM-UA and
Warner Bros. each have two.
   In fourth place was the father-son role switch movie ``Vice

The movie has been nominated for six Academy Awards.
   The Tom Selleck-Ted Danson comedy ``Three Men and A Baby'' was
in seventh place with $2.1 million, and reached a $150.6 million
cumulative gross that outdistanced the Michael Douglas-Glenn Close
thriller ``Fatal Attraction,'' which has earned more than $149
million in six months of release. ``Three Men'' earned its gross in
just 16 weeks.
   ``Off Limits,'' a story about two military undercover officers
trying to solve a series of prostitute murders in Saigon during the
Vietnam War, earned $1.58 million.
   In ninth place was director Roman Polanski's missing-person
thriller ``Frantic'' with $1.50 million, followed by Sidney

   More than 400 people have been arrested or charged
in murders, rapes, looting and acts of rioting in a southern Soviet
city divided by ethnic tensions, the prosecutor's office reported
Monday.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said the territorial dispute
between the Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan that sparked
the unrest in Sumgait was caused by the ``clear anti-socialist
spirit'' of a campaign waged by militant Armenian leaders.
   In signs of continuing tension in the region, 7,000 people
reportedly staged a protest march in the Armenian capital, Yerevan,
and the official Tass news agency and Soviet television condemned
two of the Armenians by name.
   The Armenians are demanding the union of the predominantly
Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh, part of Azerbaijan since 1923,
with Armenia.
   On Feb. 28, after repeated demonstrations calling for union with
Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh and Yerevan, rioting broke out in
Sumgait, an industrial city in Azerbaijan.
   Official Soviet accounts have said the victims were of various
nationalities, but Armenian sources said Armenians living in
Sumgait were sought out and killed by Azeris, members of the
predominantly ethnic group in Azerbaijan.
   Moscow-based journalists have been barred from traveling to the
Caucasus since unrest there began, and have been unable to verify
reports.
   The Soviet Prosecutor's Office, in a report distributed by Tass
Monday night, said 32 people ``of various nationalities'' were
killed in Sumgait, and 197, including about 100 policemen, were
injured.
   In addition, there were reports of 12 cases of rape, thefts at
more than 100 apartments, and damage to 26 stores and more than 20
motor vehicles, the prosecutor's office said.
   The report, which Tass said was complied by investigators from
the prosecutor's office, was the most complete official account of
the unrest to date.
   ``Most of those who took part in the murders, rape, assaults and
theft have been identified by now,'' the report said. ``Some of the
42 people who have been arrested have a criminal record.''
   In addition, 400 people have been brought to administrative
account for violations of public order, the report said. Soviet
police have the right to mete out fines and short jail terms for
minor offensives without recourse to the courts.
   The prosecutors' office made no mention of ethnic hatred as a
reason for the violence, blaming it on ``a group of hooligans.''
   In February, clashes took place in Nagorno-Karabakh in which two
people were killed and about 50 injured, the prosecutor's report
said.
   It said investigations were continuing to find the instigators.
   Pravda, in a report on the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, used
tough language to criticize Armenian militants who have formed the
``Karabakh Commission'' to demand reunification.
   ``They claim they fight for socio-economic development of the
region, but they consciously or unconsciously use methods which
Western Sovietologists recommend for fighting against socialism.
Thus we see that a noble idea of a reunion has a clear
anti-socialist spirit,'' Pravda said.
   Tass, in a commentary read on state-run TV's evening news,
criticized commission members I. Muradyan and K. Nagepetyan, saying
they refused to listen to people calling for reason and calm at a
March 19 meeting of the group.
   It said commission organizers ``cynically and perfidiously'' are
willing to exploit difficulties experienced by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.
   The disputed area, smaller than the state of Delaware, has been
part of mostly Moslem Azerbaijan for 50 years, even though
three-fourths of its 157,000 residents are Armenians, most of whom
are Christian.
   Gorbachev has promised that another meeting of the policy-making
Central Committee will be held to consider the Nagorno-Karabakh
question and relations among the country's more than 100 ethnic
groups. In February, the committee refused an earlier request for
restitution of the area.
   Pravda did not say outright that the region should remain in
Azerbaijan, but denounced using demonstrations, strikes and mass
meetings to pressure officials for a decision in favor of reunion.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan, an Armenian nationalist now in Moscow, said he
was told by telephone from Yerevan that 7,000 people marched Monday
to the Press House, headquarters of Armenia's official media, to
protest the Pravda story.
   The article was signed by a Pravda correspondent in Armenia, Y.
Arakelyan, and two other correspondents. However, an Armenian
official said Monday night Arakelyan denied seeing or signing the
article.
   ``They forged his name because they needed an Armenian name on
the article,'' Gamlet Kocharyan, an industrial worker and member of
the governing council of the Armenian city of Kafar, said in a
telephone interview.
   In recent weeks, some officials blamed for the problems linked
to Nagorno-Karabakh and Sumgait have been ousted.

   ``This is our last
forest,'' said ranger Veerawat Dheeraprasart, pointing down a deep
river valley. ``If the dam is built here, all this will vanish, and
nobody will ever be able to replace it.''
   Veerawat, the chief ranger of this rich wildlife sanctuary
astride the border with Burma, is among thousands who have joined
what unquestionably has become the greatest environmental battle in
Thailand's history _ a fight to persuade the government not to
build a dam in Thailand's last virgin forest.
   In a country that once was jungle-carpeted and teeming with
wildlife, it is rare today to see a tract of undisturbed forest, an
unpolluted river, white-handed gibbons or free-ranging tigers.
   Anti-dam groups have held rock concerts and demonstrations, some
featuring life-like models of crucified animals, in their campaign.
   Newspapers are probing the issue in unprecedented detail. Former
Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj says the government could face a mass
uprising if it approves the Nam Choan dam.
   The dam's proponents say Nam Choam needs to be built, in what is
the largest remaining area of protected forest in Southeast Asia,
to increase Thailand's energy supply by about 2 percent.
   The government's Electric Generating Authority of Thailand has
described the proposed, 580-megawatt dam as the ``last possible
exploitable source of hydro power'' in the country. It says it will
create a reservoir that would also help irrigate farm land and
assure water supplies in times of drought.
   The projected dam site is still hard to get to: a lurching,
nine-hour drive over dirt roads from Bangkok, the Thai capital,
followed by a four-hour jungle trek. When monsoons lash the
countryside, a three-day elephant ride offers the only access.
   But dam opponents claim construction of Nam Choan, with the
necessary approach roads, facilities and ensuing human
encroachment, would spell doom for what they say is also the last
area in Thailand large enough to ensure the survival of a wide
variety of wildlife.
   Found in the Thung Yai and the adjacent Huay Kha Khaeng
Sanctuary, an area about the size of Delaware, are large mammals,
such as elephant, gaur, tiger and clouded leopard; some 350 species
of birds, and a wide range of plant life. A number of the species
are classified as endangered in Thailand, some worldwide.
   Foreign conservation groups have written letters expressing
concern to the Thai government. In December, Britain's Prince
Philip, head of the World Wildlife Fund, urged an independent
environmental impact study before a final decision is reached. A
similar plea came from more than 1,300 conservationists and
scientists at the general assembly in February of the Swiss-based
International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources.
   The Electric Generating Authority maintains that Nam Choan would
degrade only 4 percent of the area. But ranger Veerawat, who has
served for 10 years in the sanctuary, contends the 47-mile-long dam
reservoir would not only eradicate a biologically vital riverine
valley but also disrupt the migration routes of animals, forcing
them into smaller habitats.
   Opponents also dispute the 4 percent degradation estimate,
saying that in Thailand roads built into remote, forested areas
have inevitably been followed by massive logging, with collusion
between businessmen and corrupt officials circumventing protective
legislation.
   Loggers are already felling the rich forests along the park
boundary.
   Pisit na Patalung, secretary-general of Wildlife Fund Thailand,
one of some 30 private organizations opposing the proposal, said
the dam issue has raised an environmental awareness among Thais.
Until recent years, the public appeared apathetic as the country's
once teeming wildlife was slaughtered and forests that blanketed
about 70 percent of the country a generation ago were reduced to
around 15 percent of total area today.
   The dam was first proposed in the early 1970s but plans were
shelved in 1983 in wake of protests and charges that environmental
impact studies were sloppy and improper.
   In 1986, the Electric Generating Authority asked that the
project be reconsidered and the government appointed a 40-man
committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister Thienchai Sirisamphan to
come up with a decision, which is expected soon.
   Some opponents believe government leaders will be impressed by
their arguments that Thailand now has enough alternate energy
sources, including offshore natural gas and lignite, to scrap the
dam proposal.
   Others, however, feel that too many key bureaucrats and
politicians are still little concerned over environmental problems.
   Another wildlife ranger, Sueb Nakhasathien, didn't sound
optimistic.
   ``Thais haven't yet put a price on the environment,'' he said.
``They don't realize that trees and water have a price, that
wildlife has a price.''

   Vice President George Bush and Democratic presidential contender
Jesse Jackson each snared another victory Sunday, winning their
parties' primaries in Puerto Rico.
   But Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis remained the leader of
the Democratic presidential pack because Jackson picked up no
delegates in the non-binding ``beauty contest'' in the U.S.
commonwealth.
   Bush swept the winner-take-all GOP contest in Puerto Rico, with
14 delegates at stake. Puerto Rico GOP Chairman Luis Ferre declared
that ``Bush has the 14 delegates,'' even though the counting was
proceeding slowly. With results from almost one-third of the
precincts, Bush had picked up 97 percent of the vote, while Dole
had gotten only 3 percent.
   On the Democratic side, Jesse Jackson won the non-binding
primary that hinged more on local issues than the candidates. With
31 percent of the precincts reporting, Jackson had 35 percent of
the votes. The nearest contender was Dukakis with 23 percent,
followed by Illinois Sen. Paul Simon with 20 percent.
   The 51-member Democratic delegation from Puerto Rico was
expected to go to the convention uncommitted and vote as a bloc.
The commonwealth will send an additional five party leaders,
including the governor, to the convention as delegates.
   Bob Dole, fighting for the survival of his Republican
presidential bid, was in Wisconsin campaigning for the state's
April 5 primary. The Kansas senator, who has suffered a series of
crushing losses to Bush, has pledged to keep his faltering campaign
alive at least until that contest.
   Dole, who was gravely wounded in World War II, was making a
visit to a veterans hospital in Milwaukee on Sunday. Such
appearances have become a campaign staple for Dole, who likes to
use them to suggest he can surmount the greatest odds, as he did
when he was recovering from his crippling injuries.
   Those odds appeared to lengthen Sunday, as a poll published in
the Milwaukee Journal suggested Bush held a commanding lead in
Wisconsin. The survey of likely Republican voters, with a 6-point
margin of error, said 69 percent backed Bush while 25 percent
supported Dole. Pat Robertson trailed with 6 percent.
   ``I've got a lot of hill to climb before April 5,'' Dole
acknowledged, but added: ``Bob Dole is a fighter.''
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis led in Wisconsin with 38
percent, with Jackson at 30 percent, the Journal survey indicated.
The other three Democrats were closely clustered: Rep. Richard
Gephardt, 11 percent; Simon, 11 percent and Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr., 10 percent. The Democratic survey had a margin of error
of 5 percentage points.
   Dukakis, at a Boston breakfast on Sunday, was upbeat after his
victory a day earlier in the Kansas Democratic caucuses, joking
that he was ``just a simple farm boy _ from Brookline,'' a Boston
suburb.
   Although he was edged out by Gephardt in delegates counted
Saturday in South Dakota and by Jackson in Texas delegates counted
the same day, Dukakis remained ahead in national delegates.
   The South Dakota totals were in line with last month's primary,
which Gephardt won. Texas had already allocated the bulk of its
delegates on Super Tuesday, with the Saturday figures from county
conventions and caucuses.
   The latest AP delegate count gave Dukakis 526.5 delegates to
508.55 for Jackson and 362.8 for Gore. Simon had 171.5, Gephardt
had 154 and 292.65 were uncommitted. To nominate, 2,082 delegates
are needed.
   Gore told about 200 members of the Harriman Society, a social
club of the Westchester Democratic Party, that the country's first
priority should be arms control so it can change its underlying
political relationship with the Soviet Union.
   ``The next great negotiating effort beyond the strategic arms
agreement will have to come in conventional arms control,'' Gore
said, adding, ``There is a deep and understandable fear that the
balance of forces could be less stable after reductions than
before.''
   Before his speech at a fund-raising cocktail party, Gore said
the April 19 New York primary ``may well turn out to be the
critical contest.''
   Jackson got an enthusiastic reception when he addressed
California Democrats, meeting in Palm Springs. All the candidates
were invited to address the annual gathering, but only Jackson
accepted.
   ``There's room for you in the Jackson campaign,'' he said to
cheers and applause.
   All the Democrats planned to spend at least three days in
Michigan this week in advance of Saturday's Democratic caucuses,
with 138 delegates at stake.
   Simon, who jump-started his stalled campaign with a win in his
home state of Illinois last week, was campaigning Sunday in
Michigan, where he has said he hopes for a respectable showing but
is not expecting a victory.
   ``I'd be fooling you if I said we expected to win in Michigan,''
he said.
   Gephardt was taking a day off on Sunday at home in suburban
Washington. The Missouri congressman, who was the big Democratic
loser on Super Tuesday and did not mount a real effort in Illinois,
has staked his hopes on a strong showing in Michigan, and planned
to spend almost every day of this week in the state.
   Bush, too, was in Washington Sunday, where he has spent most of
his time since his Illinois victory last Tuesday. He planned to
resume campaigning on Monday.
   The vice president was meeting Monday in Trenton with New Jersey
Gov. Thomas H. Kean, and some leading state Republicans said the
session could mean Kean planned to endorse the vice president. A
Kean spokesman, Carl Golden, would not comment on whether an
endorsement was forthcoming.
   Bush planned appearances in Connecticut this week with Sen.
Lowell Weicker Jr., who has stopped short of formally endorsing the
vice president. But Weicker, like Bush the scion of a powerful
Connecticut family, has been going out of his way lately to praise
him.
   Connecticut holds its primary March 29, with 35 GOP delegates at
stake. Dole planned to venture into the state toward the end of the
week, but Robertson had no Connecticut appearances scheduled this
week.

<HEAD>Report: Fusion Reaction Achieved Using Nuclear Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal researchers working in secret have
succeeded in igniting a nuclear fusion reaction in tiny pellets of
hydrogen by using radiation from an exploding nuclear weapon,
according to a published report.
   The New York Times, citing scientists and officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity, reported in its Monday editions that the
successful experiment occurred about two years ago at an
underground nuclear test site in Nevada.
   The results have triggered a dispute over how experiments in
small-scale fusion, or ``microfusion,'' should proceed, the
newspaper said.
   Scientists have long tried to tame nuclear fusion reactions, in
the hope they could eventually lead to an unlimited and relatively
cheap source of electrical power. In fusion reactions, which are
found in stars and hydrogen bombs, atoms are joined together to
release energy; they contrast with fission reactions in which atoms
are split rather than combined.
   In most cases, the scientists have tried to use concentrated
light from giant lasers to trigger a fusion reaction, but
laser-based fusion has never proved successful. The secret
experiment in Nevada, the Times said, instead used X-ray radiation
from a nuclear weapon directed at tiny fuel pellets.
   The prototype fuel pellets are glass capsules filled with
hydrogen isotopes, the Times said. A dozen pellets can easily fit
on the head of a pin, but their power output could be equivalent to
hundreds of pounds of high explosives, the newspaper said.
   The secret achievement required more energy than expected,
scientists told the Times. The newspaper said scientists and
government officials are arguing over which direction fusion
research should go.
   Some say the laser-based microfusion program needs a radical
change of course, the Times reported, while others say the nuclear
approach, while unconventional, was a milestone that generated
valuable data that will help make fusion practical.
   The Times said it is believed that the experiments have never
been publicly disclosed. It said that last September, Sheldon
Kahalas, director of the nation's microfusion effort, told a
Princeton University conference that the effort had reached a
``historical turning point,'' but refused to elaborate.

   Et tu, Al? That's right, Al Pacino, like his
predecessor Marlon Brando, is bringing an urban accent and
street-wise ways to the patrician role of Marc Antony in a
production of ``Julius Caesar'' this week.
   ``Casting Brando was a great idea because Brando is a great
actor _ and so is Al,'' the producer, Joseph Papp, said in an
interview published Sunday in The New York Times.
   When the film version of ``Julius Caesar'' was made in 1953,
Brando was best known as the brutal Stanley Kowalski in ``A
Streetcar Named Desire.'' Nevertheless, he won favorable reviews
for his portrayal of the highbrow Antony.
   ``The image, the idea that Brando had done it, was an
encouragement to me to think that I could do it too,'' said Pacino,
who grew up in the South Bronx. But he insisted, ``I have taken my
own route.''
   Also starring in the production, which opens Tuesday as part of
Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, are Martin Sheen as Brutus,
Edward Herrmann as Cassius and John McMartin as Julius Caesar.

   While Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
campaigns for the presidency, another Dukakis is quietly in the
running for her own version of the American Dream.
   Olympia Dukakis, the governor's first cousin, says she ``jumped
up and down 50 times, like a child,'' when she learned she had been
nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for her
performance as Cher's mother in the hit comedy ``Moonstruck.''
   The Greek-American actress, probably best known for her ``Aunt
Millie'' spaghetti commercials, says she thinks it's good luck that
her cousin won the New Hampshire Democratic primary in the same
week she received her nomination.
   ``There's something going on, up in the stars,'' she says in

   Newspaper columnist Ann Landers followed her own
advice and talked to counselors _ 5,000 of them at once.
   Landers, a Chicago Tribune advice columnist whose words are
carried in thousands of papers nationwide, gave the opening speech
Sunday at the convention of the American Association for Counseling
and Development.
   ``I could talk to you tonight on one of three subjects,'' said
Miss Landers, whose real name in Eppie Lederer. ``I could talk
about problems, I could talk about the wonderful people in
counseling or I could talk about sex.
   ``Because this is such a good audience, I'm going to combine all
three and talk about the sex problems of the wonderful people who
do counseling,'' she said as the audience erupted in laughter.
   Landers said at least one thing hasn't changed since she began
writing her advice column in 1955.
   ``I believe the most important thing I can do is tell my readers
to go and get counseling,'' she said.

   The imminent release of a realistic
street-gang movie starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall has
authorities here worried that life could imitate art, resulting in
outbreaks of gang violence in audiences.
   ``We'll be sorry that movie was ever made,'' said Los Angeles
County sheriff's Sgt. Wes McBride, who attended a private screening
March 6.
   Many of the 150 gang investigators invited to the screening said
the film, ``Colors,'' features graphic violence and the use of real
gang names and identifying colors that could trigger a wave of
violence.
   ``It's going to leave dead bodies from one end of this town to
the other,'' said McBride, president of the California Gang
Investigators Association. ``I wouldn't be the least bit surprised
if a shooting erupted in a movie theater.''
   In the film, directed by Dennis Hopper, Penn and Duvall play
police officers fighting gangs. Many of the extras used in the film
are real gang members.
   Officials at Orion Pictures, which is scheduled to release the
movie in Los Angeles April 15, could not be reached for comment
Sunday.

   Some Clint Eastwood fans showed they have a
soft spot in their hearts for the tough-guy actor when they offered
to pay his delinquent $63 fine for a 1977 speeding ticket.
   ``The phones have been buzzing'' since news of Eastwood's ticket
was publicized a week ago, said District Justice Marion L. Morgret
of this western Pennsylvania community.
   One Altoona resident sent a $63 check for Eastwood's fine and
asked for a receipt as proof of payment. The district justice's
staff returned the check uncashed since Eastwood technically
doesn't owe the fine anymore because of the statute of limitations.
   Eastwood was stopped on Oct. 23, 1977, for traveling 69 mph in a
55-mph zone on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

   Hundreds of partying young people
rioted on a Gulf Coast beach during the night before police moved
in with tear gas and helicopters early Sunday. And a car that sped
off a nearby ferry dock was pulled out of the gulf with two bodies
inside.
   ``What you have down there is a tremendous amount of
intoxication going on. All it takes sometimes is for someone to
bump into someone else. The crowd just turned into a riot,'' said
Jim Kaelin, an officer with the Texas Department of Public Safety.
   At least four people were stabbed and two law officers were
injured in the midnight beach melee, police said. Eight people were
arrested, and one person remained hospitalized Sunday.
   ``One thing led to another, and it became a riot out there,''
said Coast Guard spokesman Anthony E. Lloyd in Corpus Christi.
   Lloyd said most of the students appeared to be high-school age.
About 30,000 students were staying in this island resort for spring
break, he said.
   The violence began when a motorist hit a 16-year-old girl on the
beach at this Gulf Coast vacation spot on Mustang Island, offshore
from Corpus Christi, and tried to leave the scene, said DPS Officer
A.G. Michniak.
   Angry youths attacked the driver and torched the car, said
Police Chief Don Perkins. Officers pulled the man away from the
crowd before youths set the car on fire, he said.
   ``They stomped the car, broke all the glass out of it and
flipped it over,'' said Tom Frazier, 22, a student at the
University of Texas.
   It took more than 100 police officers to break up the mob with
the help of tear gas and hovering Coast Guard helicopters with
searchlights.
   The driver of the car, a 26-year-old San Antonio man, was in the
Nueces County Jail in connection with the accident, Perkins said.
Charges had not been filed by Sunday evening.
   The girl who was struck by the car was treated for abrasions and
bruises at AMI Coastal Bend Hospital and released, nursing
supervisor Sharon Parrack said Sunday.
   A portable toilet also was set ablaze, authorities said.
   The first police on the scene tried to arrest two people
involved in the alleged hit-and-run accident but found the crowd
too much to handle.
   ``Objects were tossed and thrown at the officers and they called
for asistance,'' said a DPS dispatcher in Corpus Christi who would
not give her name.
   Police fired seven tear gas projectiles to disperse the crowd,
Kaelin said.
   Michniak said the DPS received the first call at 11:35 p.m.
Saturday and the disturbance was not declared under control until
three hours later.
   Paul Cline of Port Aransas said he saw a stabbing victim while
leaving the beach.
   ``All of a sudden, somebody yelled and a guy fell. He had blood
all over his chest,'' Cline said. ``I heard them shout, `He's
stabbed! He's stabbed!' They started tearing at his clothes, and
then the police came running over.
   ``I left. I hate to say it, but I was afraid for my life.''
   The DPS estimated the crowd at about 3,000.
   ``A good example would be to think of a high school football
stadium where everybody ran down to the field and was packed
tight,'' Kaelin said.
   In an unrelated incident several hours later, a speeding car
crashed through a barrier at a ferry landing and sank in water 20
to 25 feet deep, Lloyd said.
   The small car sailed about 75 feet in the air before splashing
into the water and sinking, said Coast Guard spokesman Bob Fisher.
   A ferry captain and deck saw the incident, Lloyd said.
   ``The car just flew right off the ferry landing,'' Lloyd said.
``It didn't stop, didn't skid or anything, it just went right into
the water, and they saw its tail end going down.''
   The identities of the two young men found in the car were not
immediately available, he said.
   Most of those injured in the rioting were treated at nearby AMI
Coastal Bend Hospital and released, said a hospital spokeswoman. A
17-year-old boy remained at the hospital Sunday in stable condition
with a superficial abdominal wound, Ms. Parrack said.

   President Reagan presented White House Chief
of Staff Howard Baker with a new presidential Medal of Freedom on
Monday after Baker's original was lost during a weekend break-in at
his home in northwest Washington.
   Baker ``is probably the only person who has received two Medals
of Freedom,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Baker and his wife, Joy, were sitting in their living room
Saturday evening when an alarm sounded. Baker went downstairs to
his study to fix what he thought would be an alarm sensor fallen
from a window pane.
   Instead, he discovered a burglar stealing expensive camera
equipment and the former Tennessee senator's Medal of Freedom.
   Baker chased the thief upstairs, downstairs and out while his
wife was phoning District police and White House security. The
burglar dropped most of the stolen items while being chased through
the house and fled into the street.
   Police arrested a man later that evening who had some of the
Bakers' camera equipment but not the medal. The man has refused to
identify himself to police.

   Honda has broken ground for a second
U.S. auto assembly plant.
   The Honda of America Manufacturing East Liberty auto plant is
scheduled to open in August 1989, company officials said. The $380
million factory will employ 1,800 workers and be capable of
producing 150,000 cars a year.
   ``This sends a message around the world that Ohio's workers can
produce world-class products,'' Gov. Richard Celeste said at
Sunday's ceremony.
   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in 1979 with
production at its motorcycle plant in Marysville, about 35 miles
northwest of Columbus. The auto plant at Marysville began
production three years later. An engine plant at Anna in western
Ohio began production in 1985.
   The new plant is part of a strategy aimed at establishing a
self-reliant motor vehicle company in the United States with
resources that compare to the Tokyo-based company's operations in
Japan, Honda officials said.

<TEXT>
   Corruption is so widespread here that
crooked guards may be watching crooks who may have been arrested by
crooked cops, defended by crooked lawyers or sentenced by crooked
judges, longtime observers say.
   ``The only thing in the last 10 years that hasn't been crooked
is both the DA's and the U.S. attorney's office,'' former District
Attorney Edward Rendell said.
   Various investigations in the nation's fifth-largest city, where
the Constitution was written 201 years ago, have resulted in
convictions or charges against judges, police, defense lawyers and
prison guards, the latest target of prosecutors.
   The wave of corruption has hit City Hall, itself.
   A federal jury last year convicted Councilman Leland Beloff and
an aide of conspiring with reputed area mob boss Nicodemo ``Little
Nicky'' Scarfo to extort $1 million from a developer.
   Last week, District Attorney Ronald Castille announced that the
arrests of seven prison guards and a cook in an escape and an
inmate's beating were part of ``Operation Ferret,'' an
investigation expected to yield more than 100 arrests among the
city's approximately 1,400 prison guards.
   Also last week, a federal judge ordered former Common Pleas
Judge Kenneth Harris to begin serving a 12-year sentence for
extorting bribes to fix cases. Harris, 67, is one of three former
city judges who have been convicted and one of 16 who have been
named in various investigations.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in February ordered eight judges
to be removed from the bench, six permanently, as a result of a
federal investigation into cash payments from Roofers Union
officials.
   In Harris' case, a lawyer-turned-informant, Barry H. Denker,
testified he gave cash to Harris and two other judges now awaiting
trial on extortion charges.
   Denker also said he gave money or gifts to police, probation
officers, trial commissioners and court criers while maintaining
his practice in criminal defense law.
   Another former lawyer, Romaine Phillips, was convicted of
racketeering, conspiracy and extortion in the Harris case.
   Assistant District Attorney Patricia Donleavy has said three or
four lawyers may yet be charged. A former aide to Harris testified
three lawyers gave him money to deliver to the judge in exchange
for favorable rulings.
   Investigations also have targeted the city's police force. Since
1983, 34 officers have been convicted in bribery and conspiracy
cases, including a deputy commissioner who was convicted of
extorting money from vice figures.
   Other agencies also have been hit, with garbage crews accused of
taking bribes to make pickups at businesses and city inspectors
accused of taking bribes for licenses.
   ``We talked to contractors who refused to work in this city
because they refused to pay off the (Licenses and Inspections)
inspectors or the Water Department,'' Castille said.
   Castille said he must defend ``some of the hard-working judges,
the hard-working city employees, the cops who put their lives on
the line and the ones who aren't corrupt.''
   The court scandal has grabbed constant attention.
   ``I don't remember anything that's quite comparable to what we
have now,'' said City Solicitor Seymour Kurland, who recently
stepped down as chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association.
   ``My feeling now is despite the image, there's a core, a very
good core, of very fine judges. There's a very fine core of judges,
of people in the city, who are making it work.''
   Judges and others whose images are being tarnished by what
officials say are a few rotten apples have become angry.
   After the extortion conviction of former senior Common Pleas
Judge Herbert R. Cain Jr., U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Eric
Holder told reporters that corruption in Philadelphia's judiciary
``starts at the top and goes all through the system.''
   The remark prompted a heated response by Common Pleas President
Judge Edward J. Bradley, who said Holder should ``keep his mouth
shut.''
   ``I don't think what he said was widely held,'' Bradley said
last week, adding that Holder told him in a letter that he also
told reporters the overwhelming majority of judges were doing
excellent work.
   Bradley said judicial corruption cases have presented an image
problem.
   ``Realistically, I've got to say it has caused the public to
have a lower perception of the court,'' Bradley said, noting the
number of questioned or convicted judges is small compared with 125
total judges.
   In his remarks after the Cain verdict, Holder also said he was
``struck by the fact that there doesn't seem to be a hue and cry
from the citizens of this city.''
   ``The way that I see it as a citizen is that if you believe that
the city officials are corrupt or the city is corrupt, you always
have a last resort and that's the courts,'' Castille said.
   ``So if you have the courts taking envelopes of cash, selling
verdicts ... then what else is there?''

   A convicted killer who escaped from a Louisiana
prison 1{ years ago and has been implicated in two interstate
kidnappings since then was arrested Sunday with a companion is also
accused in one of the abductions.
   Danny Michael Weeks, 34, was serving a life sentence for murder
and another sentence for armed robbery at the time of his escape
from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola in August 1986. He
was later placed on the FBI's 10-most-wanted list.
   Weeks was captured by a special 10-member FBI team, along with
Jorene H. Florea, 56, said chief Seattle FBI agent Don S. Tokunaga.
   Weeks and Ms. Florea apparently were just passing through the
Seattle area, Tokunaga said. Agents received an anonymous tip from
someone who had recognized Weeks as a most-wanted criminal, the
agent said.
   Agents converged on Weeks and Ms. Florea about a half-hour after
receiving the tip as the two were looking into the trunk of a car
in a residential neighborhood, Tokunaga said. ``We were fortunate
there were no incidents,'' he said.
   The two were not armed, but agents had not completed a search of
the vehicle, he said.
   Authorities said that after Weeks and a companion escaped from
the prison Aug. 24, 1986, the two men abducted a woman at
knifepoint in the parking lot of an Alexandria, La., hospital and
forced her to drive them to Houston, where she was released
unharmed about eight hours later.
   The pair then forced a second woman, who was a lieutenant in the
U.S. Army, to drive them hundreds of miles during a 50-hour ordeal
that took her to El Paso, Texas, where she was left in a shopping
center parking lot.
   Weeks' companion, James Lee Colvin, 33, of Shreveport, La., was
arrested not long after that incident. Last August, he was
convicted on fedeal charges of kidnapping, using firearms during a
violent crime, illegally possessing revolvers and transporting
stolen vehicles across state lines.
   Earlier this month, Weeks and Ms. Florea were charged with the
Feb. 23 abduction of Susan Kathleen Vincent, a Guilford, N.C.,
sheriff's deputy, from a shopping center in Greensboro, N.C. She
was released unharmed in Chicago three days later.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Ms. Vincent said Sunday night about the
capture. ``I'm real relieved.''
   Ms. Vincent said that during her abduction, her captors robbed a
bank in Davenport, Iowa. She said she also was forced to use a bank
card to withdraw money, and ended up giving her kidnappers $208.
   ``I'm real glad they caught them so soon, before they got out of
the country,'' Ms. Vincent said. ``The worst is over now. All
that's left is the court action.''
   Sheriff Layman Godwin of Ouachita Parish, La., where Weeks twice
escaped from deputies' custody in 1982 and 1983, said Seattle
authorities had better take no chances with the captured fugitive.
   ``I just hope they learn from our mistakes that he's a sharp son
of a gun,'' said Godwin. In those two earlier escapes, charges were
dropped as part of a plea bargain.
   Weeks and Ms. Florea are to appear before a U.S. magistrate in
Seattle on Monday, Tokunaga said.
   Weeks, originally from Roswell, N.M., had been serving a
99-year-sentence for armed robbery and a life sentence for a 1981

<HEAD>Campaign Spending Limits Proposed in New Form</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of spending limits for Senate
campaigns are regrouping for another battle, pursuing a new route
after Republicans talked the last attempt to death less than a
month ago.
   The push is being led by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who is
the chief sponsor of a 19-word resolution that he hopes will become
the 27th amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
   Hollings is proposing the amendment as an alternative to
legislation that was stymied by a 53-hour Republican filibuster
late last month.
   The amendment seeks to overcome a Supreme Court ruling _ Buckley
vs. Valeo in 1976 _ that says congressionally mandated spending
limits for election campaigns violate First Amendment free-speech
rights.
   The Hollings plan specifically would allow Congress to restrict
the amounts candidates can receive and spend. If the amendment were
ratified, Congress would have to pass legislation setting limits.
   Advocates of limits recite a litany of escalating campaign
costs: The average Senate winner spent $3 million in 1984, up from
$600,000 in 1976. Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., says this translates
into having to raise $10,000 a week during a six-year Senate term.
   The legislation the amendment would supplant called for a system
of voluntary spending limits for Senate campaigns, with incentives
like cheap postal and television advertising rates for participants
and public financing for them if opponents refused to observe the
limits.
   That plan has 52 sponsors, 50 of them Democrats, including
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who has been trying to bring
it to a floor vote for nearly a year against near-solid Republican
opposition.
   Republicans, arguing that limits would hamper their efforts to
gain strength in heavily Democratic states, held ranks through a
record eight cloture votes, the last coming Feb. 26 to end the
filibuster. Byrd never got more than 55 of the 60 votes needed to
shut off Senate debate.
   Hollings says he thinks he can get the support to beat any
filibuster against his plan. But he said he's uncertain whether he
can get the 67 votes needed to get a proposed constitutional
amendment through the Senate.
   He said Byrd has assured him the proposal will be brought to the
floor in the near future. ``I'm ready to go and he's ready to go,''
said Hollings, adding that he hopes to get it approved this week by
the Judiciary Committee.
   There is a different political mixture involved in the
constitutional amendment route than with the Byrd-Boren legislation
to set up voluntary limits.
   Hollings did not cosponsor the Byrd-Boren bill. Neither did
amendment cosponsors Howell Heflin, D-Ala., or Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina, Judiciary's ranking Republican. Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., is sponsoring a proposed limits amendment with slightly
different wording.
   A small group of Republicans favors limits but supported GOP
leaders in the partisan battle over the Byrd-Boren legislation.
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., voted against cloture eight times but
now says his ``strong inclination is to support this constitutional
amendment.''
   He made the statement last week at a hearing by the Judiciary
subcommittee on the Constitution, where battle lines were drawn on
both political and constitutional grounds.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., one of the filibuster leaders, said
he still was opposing limits because they would favor Democrats. If
television is driving up the cost of campaigning, he said, don't
tamper with the Constitution, force broadcasters to cut their ad
rates. If special interest money is becoming too dominant, outlaw
political action committees, McConnell said.
   Also opposing a limits amendment was the American Civil
Liberties Union, represented by Joel Gora, the Brooklyn Law School
professor who was one of the winning lawyers in the Buckley-Valeo
case.
   ``The ACLU believes that government restrictions on political
campaign funding infringe on freedom of speech and association,''
Gora said. ``They would enshrine in the Constitution itself the
power of government to restrict campaign activity and hence
political speech.''
   But Washington attorney Lloyd Cutler, who helped argue the
losing side in the 1976 case, said larger questions are involved.
   ``The evidence is overwhelming by now that unlimited campaign
expenditures will eventually grow to the point where they consume
so much of our political energies and so fracture our political
consensus that they will make the political process incapable of
governing effectively,'' Cutler said.
   ``One might fairly paraphrase Lord Acton's famous aphorism about
power by saying: All political money corrupts; unlimited political
money corrupts absolutely.''

<HEAD>Key Question in Meese Probe: Did he Profit?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 10 months, one of the many unanswered
questions in the criminal investigation of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III is whether he benefited financially from his efforts on
behalf of an Iraqi oil pipeline project or scandal-plagued Wedtech
Corp., sources familiar with the probe say.
   Last May 11, independent counsel James McKay launched his
inquiry of Meese's assistance to Wedtech and the probe has spread
to the attorney general's involvement with the pipeline.
   In both instances, McKay's investigators have been examining
stock trades made on Meese's behalf by his investment manager, W.
Franklyn Chinn. Chinn and Meese were brought together by Meese's
longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, a central figure in both the
Wedtech scandal and the pipeline project.
   It was disclosed earlier this month that:
   _In connection with the $1 billion proposed pipeline, Swiss
oilman Bruce Rappaport paid $150,000 to his attorney Wallach, who
directed the funds to an account owned by Chinn.
   Rappaport was a partner in the project with San Francisco-based
Bechtel Group Inc., which was going to build the pipeline.
Rappaport was brought into the deal in 1985 primarily because of
his close ties to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
   _The money from the Meese Partners account, Wallach's $150,000
placed in the Chinn account and several hundred thousand dollars
from Chinn's biggest customer, Marymount College of Palos Verdes,
Calif., were used as capital by Chinn to buy hard-to-get, brand-new
stock issues, which Chinn sold later the same day. It would have
been difficult for Chinn to obtain such stock with Meese's money
alone.
   ``Without using the holdings of the other accounts he
controlled, ... Mr. Chinn may not have been able to conduct the
number of trades he did ... on behalf of Meese Partners,'' a
congressional subcommittee said in a report this month.
   _Once the stock was sold and the profit and loss determined,
Chinn assigned profits and losses to his various customers.
   Overall, Meese invested $50,000 and came away 18 months later
with $95,000, almost all of it gained through a total of 23 one-day
stock trades. Eighteen of the trades were profitable.
   In seven of the trades, the attorney general didn't have enough
money in his account to generate the profits and losses that were
assigned him.
   Chinn's biggest customer, Marymount College, didn't fare nearly
as well as Meese.
   Was the stock trading actually a well-disguised payoff to Meese?
   That question is one that McKay's office has been unable to
resolve, say the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Central to the criminal investigation is whether there was a
plan to steer the proceeds of Chinn's stock transactions to Meese
and whether the attorney general knew about it.
   The attorney general says he knew nothing about the transactions
because he had set up a limited blind partnership with Chinn's
company under which details were to be kept secret from Meese as a
way to protect the attorney general from violating rules against
conflict of interest.
   The investigators face a wall of silence from the others
involved in setting up the financial arrangements, Chinn and
Wallach, who are both under indictment for racketeering in the
Wedtech scandal.
   Wallach denied to McKay's investigators that he gave anything of
value to Meese, but Wallach refused to tell McKay anything about
his dealings with Wedtech, his knowledge of the Meese-Chinn
partnership and his dealings with Chinn.
   McKay said that after the Wedtech trial expected later this year
of Wallach, Chinn and business associate R. Kent London, the
independent counsel may seek their testimony again.
   The attorney general's good fortune in stock trading began
months after he smoothed the way for Wallach to discuss the
pipeline with then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who
met with Wallach and Rappaport in June 1985. Later in the year,
Meese and Wallach met with Peres about the pipeline, which was
never built.
   Also during the period the stock trading was taking place, Chinn
sat on the board of directors of Wedtech, the Bronx, N.Y., defense
contractor that allegedly paid out millions of dollars to lawyers
and lobbyists in an attempt to influence various public officials,
including Meese, in the awarding of federal contracts.
   One of those lawyers was Wallach, who was paid $1.3 million from
1981 through 1986 by Wedtech.
   The stock trades that made profits for the attorney general took
place some four years after Meese, then White House counselor,
arranged for his deputy, James Jenkins, to intervene on behalf of
Wedtech in connection with a $32 million no-bid contract to build
small engines for the Army. Despite the misgivings of Army
officials over what they regarded as a high price, Wedtech was
awarded the contract following a White House meeting called by
Jenkins.
   Meese ended the financial arrangement with Chinn last year after
the investment adviser came under criminal investigation in the
Wedtech scandal and after public disclosure that Chinn had sat on
Wedtech's board of directors.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Ortega's Honduras Foray Recalls Nixon Tactic in
1970</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega sent
his forces into Honduras last week, it was not the first time
troops from one country had crossed a border to attack enemy
sanctuaries.
   Richard M. Nixon did much the same thing in 1970.
   The parallels between what U.S. forces and allied South
Vietnamese troops did in Cambodia in April 1970 and what Nicaraguan
forces did in Honduras last week are not precise.
   But the justification offered for the two actions 18 years apart
is the same: that cross-border sanctuaries used by enemy forces to
make war are fair game for the country under attack.
   In 1970, North Vietnam and South Vietnamese rebels were using
sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia to wage war against the U.S.-backed
government in Saigon.
   On April 30 of that year, more than 20,000 U.S. and South
Vietnamese troops crossed the border into Cambodia to clear out the
sanctuaries controlled by the North Vietnamese.
   Now, almost 18 years later, Ortega has sent his forces into
Honduras, apparently for a similar purpose. According to U.S.
estimates, upwards of 1,500 Nicaraguan forces, backed by air power,
entered Honduras last Tuesday to wipe out resupply facilities of
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The Nicaraguan action prompted President Reagan, in response to
a request from Honduran President Jose Azcona, to send 3,200 U.S.
troops to Honduras in a show of American moral support. The troops
are under instructions to stay away from the area of hostilities.
   Reagan's decision touched off demonstrations in several U.S.
cities, much as Nixon's decision did 18 years ago on a much larger
scale. Days after Nixon's announcement, four students were killed
by National Guard troops at Kent State University.
   George Carver, a former CIA analyst on Vietnam, said Friday it
would be a mistake to suggest that the Cambodian and Honduran
examples are analogous.
   He said the Honduran bases are used by a Nicaraguan force
against the Nicaraguan government while, for the most part, the
sanctuaries in Cambodia were used by North Vietnam to take over a
foreign country, South Vietnam.
   Carver, now an associate at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a private research group, also recalled that
while Nixon acknowledged the offensive into Cambodia publicly,
Ortega has not admitted the Nicaraguan foray into Honduras.
   The Reagan administration has said that the evidence confirming
the Nicaraguan presence there is beyond dispute.
   In criticizing the Nicaraguan action this past week, Reagan
administration officials have said it constitutes a potential
danger to Honduras, a country friendly to the United States.
   Sidestepping the issue of the presence of Contra base camps in
Honduras, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the decision
to dispatch U.S. forces was a show of support to a country whose
``territorial integrity is being violated by the Cuban and
Soviet-supported Sandinista Army.''
   But there is no evidence that the short-term Sandinista goals in
Honduras go beyond destruction of the Contra camps, just as the
U.S. target in 1970 was not Cambodia but the communist sanctuaries
there.
   ``We take this action not for the purpose of expanding the war
into Cambodia but for the purpose of ending the war in Vietnam,''
Nixon said at the time.
   There is another key similarity. Nixon felt he was justified in
going after the North Vietnamese camps to strike a blow against
communist expansionism.
   Ortega sees the Contras in much the same way that Nixon regarded
the North Vietnamese. The Contras, Ortega has said, are
``mercenaries'' who serve American strategic aims.
   A footnote: The American and South Vietnamese forces left
Cambodia after a few weeks. U.S. troops were gone from South
Vietnam within three years and the North Vietnamese conquest was
achieved two years later. As for Cambodia, a communist regime took
power in 1975 and killed an estimated 2 million Cambodians during
its extraordinarily bloody 3{-year rule. The country is now under
Vietnamese military occupation.

   Alexander M. Lewyt, an inventor who
developed a vacuum cleaner designed to operate without interfering
with TV or radio reception, died Friday at age 79.
   Lewyt, who was born in New York, the son of an Austrian
immigrant who ran a gadget shop, held patents on scores of
inventions.
   When he learned of undertakers' difficulty in fastening neckties
on corpses, the teen-age Lewyt devised a new kind of bow tie that
clipped on. He sold 50,000 of them. It was unclear whether he ever
patented the concept.
   He was best known for the compact Lewyt vacuum cleaner, which
had no dust bag and was designed not to cause interference.
   In the first eight years after his vacuum cleaner was introduced
after World War II, Lewyt Corp. sold 2 million of them. During the
war, Lewyt Corp. did a multi-million dollar business making such
things as radar antennas and popcorn poppers.
   Lewyt sold his interest in the company to the Budd Corp. in the
1950s.

<HEAD>US Wine Producers to Face More European Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large surplus of table wine in the European
Economic Community will mean more competition for U.S. producers,
according to an Agriculture Department report.
   During the late 1970s and early '80s, EEC exporters supplied a
rising share of the U.S. wine market, with imports peaking in 1984.
Since then, Spain and Portugal have joined the trading bloc,
raising EEC membership to 12 countries.
   ``Based on grape, wine and transportation cost comparisons,
California, France and Italy have similar total costs for producing
and transporting wine to major U.S. markets,'' the report said.
   Imports of non-premium table wines from the EEC ``should not
reach the levels they did in 1984 in the near future,'' it said.
``However, because of its wine surplus, which is projected to reach
20 million to 25 million hectoliters in 1991-92, the (EEC) will
continue to place heavy emphasis on exports to the United States.''
   A liter is slightly more than a quart, and a hectoliter is 100
liters, or roughly 26.5 gallons. The EEC wine surplus, therefore,
could exceed 660 million gallons in four years.
   The report was prepared by two Cornell University agricultural
economists, Gerald B. White and David Blandford, for the
department's Economic Research Service.
   According to studies, the transportation costs of shipping wine
to the eastern United States are about $3 per case from Italy and
France, and $2 from California. Actual production costs were
estimated at $9.98 per nine-liter case in California; $9.37 in
France; and $8.10 in Italy.
   One reason for the large EEC wine surplus has been a shift in
European drinking habits, according to consumer studies in France.
   ``A switch from high-energy-using manual labor to
lower-energy-using work reduced caloric needs of which wine was an
important source,'' the report said. ``In addition, wine had an
`old product' image that was less in tune with younger people than
other beverages such as mineral water, beer and soft drinks.''
   The French studies probably also explain declining wine
consumption in Italy and Spain, ``where an exodus of population
from the rural economy continues and old traditions are being
replaced,'' the report said.
   On the other hand, there has been a trend toward the consumption
of higher quality wines produced in specific regions, the report
added. Accordingly, EEC policy for the last 15 years has emphasized
the production of the quality wines.

   The Agriculture Department is tuning up its
honey support program for 1988, and there's still a few days left
to submit public comments on what to do.
   Congress authorized in the Food Security Act of 1985 a
``marketing loan'' program for honey to help reduce inventories
held as surplus by the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   Under the marketing loan concept, a farmer can get a regular CCC
loan at a specified price support level and then, if he chooses,
can repay the loan at the prevailing market rate.
   The law set the honey support at 64 cents per pound for 1986 and
63 cents in 1987. It says the loan for 1988 through 1990 will be
the rate for the previous year, reduced by 5 percent. However, the
1988-90 support cannot be lower than 75 percent of the average
price received by honey producers in the preceding five years,
dropping the years of highest and lowest prices.
   Currently, the loan repayment rate for 1987-crop honey ranges
between 34 cents and 40 cents, depending on the color and class.
   According to the most recently published figures, inventories of
CCC-owned honey as of Oct. 31, 1987, totaled about 71.2 million
pounds, down from 102.1 million pounds a year earlier.
   Written comments on the 1988 honey program, including whether to
continue the marketing loan program, can be sent by March 25 to:
Director, Commodity Analysis Division, USDA-ASCS, Room 3741-S, P.O.
Box 2415, Washington, D.C. 20013.

   A war against the cotton boll weevil is being
expanded in Arizona after successful tests in other parts of the
Southwest, says the Agriculture Department.
   James Glosser, acting administrator of the department's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, said an initial $6 million
program in California, western Arizona and northern Mexico reduced
the weevil population by 95 percent in one year and eliminated it
in three years.
   Now, the campaign is being extended into central and eastern
Arizona, which will alleviate the problem of reinfestation from
migrating weevils, he said. The expanded program will cost about
$20 million, with cotton producers paying 70 percent of the bill.
   ``Expanding the program will not only protect Arizona
agriculture but will safeguard the progress made in California and
Mexico as well,'' Glosser said.
   By using traps baited with the weevil's natural sex attractant,
or pheromone, the insect's populations can be pinpointed, according
to program director Frank Myers of the Arizona Cotton Growers
Research and Protection Council.
   After that, the insecticide malathion will be applied to fields
by airplanes or with ground equipment.
   Similar programs are also working in the Southeast, where the
boll weevil plagued cotton farmers for almost a century, costing
them an estimated $12 billion since its entry from Mexico in 1892,
according to USDA officials.

   The Republicans have a runaway winner and now
the Democrats are in a quandary: They'd like to keep up with the
Bushes and have one of their own, but the prospects for wheeling
and dealing are so delicious that many party leaders can barely
contain themselves.
   ``It keeps the excitement going,'' says Colorado Gov. Roy
Roemer. ``I'd like to have a voice.''
   ``There will be brokering,'' says New York's Mario Cuomo. ``The
question is where and how.''
   If it happens at the convention, Cuomo says, ``the whole United
States will see you in the grubby business of cutting deals. I say
that's no way to do it. I say let's do it when they're not
watching.''
   Tip O'Neill, the retired House speaker, harkens back to 1952,
when the Democrats nominated Adlai Stevenson in the most recent
roll-call convention. ``It makes it more fun,'' he says.
   Of course Stevenson lost to Eisenhower and the Democrats were
out in the cold for eight years. Former President Carter says the
boisterous 1980 convention made him ``weaker than when I went in''
and he is urging that the Democrats find a ``winning ticket'' and
unite behind it in Atlanta.
   That's the cool, calculated Democratic Party talking. The one
whose chairman, Paul Kirk, wants to have a June summit to work
things out before the July roll call in Atlanta.
   The problem is that Democratic voters haven't made it clear whom
they want and party leaders fear that no one will emerge from the
primaries.
   Despite the predicament, the Democrats can be sure that George
Bush is not taking his presidency for granted. So far, the struggle
for the Democratic nomination probably says more about the party's
strength (breadth of support, with multiple candidates tapping
different veins of support) than its weakness (no obvious leader to
rebuild the party's old majority coalition).
   ``The process is going to work its will,'' predicts Sen. John
Kerry. ``Nobody said the process had to end by March.''
   For Kerry's candidate, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
process is likely to end in May, one way or the other. Alone among
the candidates, Dukakis has the money, the organization and the
wintertime success to nail down the nomination during the second
round of primaries and caucuses.
   Democrats wouldn't even bother thinking about brokered
conventions except that Dukakis' third-place disappointment in
Illinois raised questions about his dominance in the string of
urban states to come. He has from Michigan on Saturday to Ohio on
May 3 to eliminate the doubts _ with these key states in between:
Wisconsin, April 5, New York on April 19 and Pennsylvania on April
26.
   The Gary Hart law of politics says that opportunity knocks just
once every four years. If Dukakis stumbles in the next five weeks,
there will be little hope of redemption in California in June (let
alone Atlanta in July).
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., after an incredible two-week anguish over
where to go next, is now plotting an April 5 ambush in Wisconsin to
start the ball rolling his way. He wouldn't seem to stand much
chance, except that Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois is crossing the
state line to make another last stand. Simon could drain enough
Dukakis support to deny him the victory.
   Like Dukakis, Gore will either win at the ballot box or he won't
win at all. His hope is to block Dukakis in April and May and then
sweep California and New Jersey on Final Tuesday, June 6.
   If the two of them slug it out without a winner, then who?
   Jesse Jackson? He followed up his Southern victories with second
place in Kansas last Saturday and he maintains a slight lead over
Dukakis in the competition for Texas delegates _ but many voters
tell pollsters they would never consider voting for him. This
``high negative'' rating probably disqualifies him from the ticket.
   Richard Gephardt? He was the Democratic golden boy for a while,
but all the congressional endorsements in the world can't help if
his trade and family-farm message doesn't win him Michigan this
weekend.
   That leaves the usual suspects: Cuomo, Sam Nunn and Bill
Bradley, with Lee Iacocca on the list to add spice. Nunn has thrown
in with Gore, but not very vigorously. Bradley is saying nice
things about Dukakis and Cuomo is reconsidering his well-honed
neutrality. In any event, it hardly seems worth exploring the
alternatives until the coming ``Dukakis primaries'' have run their
course.

   Jean Sutherland hasn't touched her husband or
heard his voice in nearly three years, but she lives in the capital
of Lebanon so she can stay close to the American hostage.
   ``I am there and I feel very good there,'' Mrs. Sutherland said
in an interview last week during a visit to the nation's capital.
``I don't have any real fears.''
   Mrs. Sutherland has not courted publicity or criticized U.S.
government officials to draw attention to the plight of her
Scots-born husband, Thomas Sutherland. Few recognized her at a
prayer ceremony Wednesday to mark Terry Anderson's third year in
captivity.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held American hostage. He and Sutherland have
been held in the same room for some of the time, according to
former hostages.
   Sutherland, dean of agriculture at the American University of
Beirut, was kidnapped June 9, 1985, arriving in Beirut after a
visit to the United States. His wife was in Fort Collins, Colo., to
finish her Ph.D. thesis in English.
   A soft-spoken but direct woman, Mrs. Sutherland returned
permanently to Beirut in October 1985. Except for periodic visits
to see her three daughters, all in their 20s, she has remained in
Lebanon.
   The State Department granted the wives of the American hostages
special permission to stay in Lebanon, which is off-limits to U.S.
citizens. Mrs. Sutherland is one of the few Americans remaining in
the country.
   Life in Beirut has settled into a routine for Mrs. Sutherland,
who teaches English at the American University and lives on the
campus in West Beirut. Most of her time is spent working _ usually
from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
   Chaos in the country has forced many teachers to flee, leaving
the school short-staffed, Mrs. Sutherland said. Although her
schedule is demanding, work gives meaning to her life and makes it
bearable, she said.
   ``Being at the university is so rewarding; there is so much to
do,'' she said. She also created two funds to raise money for the
university and Lebanese children orphaned and handicapped by the
war.
   ``She's really a saint,'' said Barbara Henry, a spokeswoman for
the university in New York.
   While often too busy to leave the campus, Mrs. Sutherland said
she travels around the city occasionally to shop and visit friends,
especially the wives of the other hostages.
   Security has improved since the Syrians stationed troops in West
Beirut about a year ago to quell the warring militias. ``In a sense
the lifestyle has changed quite remarkably and we have a sense of
living quite normally.''
   Murders, muggings and robberies are common _ as in any big city
_ but indiscriminate shelling has virtually ceased, she said.
   The challenge for Lebanon these days is the economy, which has
taken a beating as a result of the civil war. The electricity and
the water often shut off, and imported goods are sometimes in short
supply, she said.
   While so near to her husband, Mrs. Sutherland has had few clues
about him or his captors. The hostages are thought to be held in
the southern suburbs of Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems close
to Iran.
   Of the nine American hostages, six have wives living in Lebanon.
Two _ Mrs. Sutherland and Virginia Steen _ were born in the United
States; the others are from the Middle East.
   The network of wives ``is a very strong support group,'' Mrs.
Sutherland said, although she gets together on a frequent basis
only with Ilham Ghandour, Joseph Cicippio's wife. Cicippio was the
comptroller at the university.
   The two live on the AUB campus, while three other women live
near the Beirut University College where their husbands taught.
They are Mrs. Steen and the wives of Robert Polhill and Jesse
Turner. Also living in Lebanon is the wife of Frank H. Reed.
   The wives pass along rumors and tips about the hostages, and
contact people they think might be helpful. But it is ``sort of
hard over so much time'' to stay in touch, she said.
   One of Mrs. Sutherland's major concerns for her husband is the
frustration that he must feel by being unable to work or use his
time constructively.
   ``Tom was always a worker and not being able to do something
must be driving him crazy,'' she said.
   Former hostages have said boredom was one of the worst parts of
captivity.
   To amuse themselves, Sutherland and Anderson planned an
imaginary farm while in captivity, according to the Rev. Lawrence
Martin Jenco, a former hostage who spent time with them.
   Mrs. Sutherland lives in the present, refusing to look too far
into the future. Asked how long she expects her husband to remain a
hostage, she replied: ``We don't know how many years it is going to
be.''
   And when he is released, she will be there, she said.

   Like the fog that rolls in
from the Atlantic, enshrouding this base most mornings, mystery
surrounds the payday robbery and killing of the USS John Hancock's
disbursement officer.
   Sometime early Tuesday after Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad finished his
watch at midnight, someone shot him in the head at close range,
choked him and shoved his body into a storage area on the destroyer.
   The killer vanished with $94,629 in Navy payroll and blank
checks.
   This base, stunned 10 months ago when 37 sailors were killed in
an attack on one of its ships _ the USS Stark _ in the Persian
Gulf, is reeling from what veterans say is a crime like none in
memory here.
   The Naval Investigative Service, which is probing the
24-year-old Prasad's killing in conjunction with the Duval County
Sheriff's Office, has been mum about the investigation, saying it
will remain so until there is a break in the case. The sheriff's
office also hasn't commented on the case.
   Some have speculated, however, that because visits to such a
ship are tightly restricted, the killer could be one of the 320
officers and sailors aboard the destroyer. Even Navy personnel
without specific business have difficulty going aboard, said Chief
Petty Officer Art Riccio, a Navy spokesman.
   ``That feeling is there. People are looking about, asking
questions, trying to find out what is going on,'' Command Master
Chief Curtis T. Cook said in an interview with The Florida
Times-Union.
   Or, the killer could be someone who slipped through the security
gate at the base and a checkpoint at the pier, got on the ship,
committed the crime and escaped.
   The Navy is refusing to say if there are any leads, whether it
has any suspects or whether the probe is focusing on crew members.
However, Navy and civilian investigators have been interviewing
members of the ship's crew.
   Mayport has 35 ships, including two aircraft carriers, and
18,500 active-duty personnel and 3,000 civilian employees.
   Prasad, the only son of Indian-born parents, Rameshwar and
Mithilesh, was a strict vegetarian, unusual in the
meat-and-potatoes Navy. Fellow officers aboard the ship called him
``Radish'' because of his penchant for vegetables.
   As the man responsible for handing out pay, Prasad probably got
to know more people than many others during nearly three years in
the Navy.
   ``He smiled a lot. He was friendly and he always said hello to
the rest of the crew. He probably could tell you by sight the name,
and probably the pay record, of everyone on board,'' Cook said.
   Prasad's mother, in a telephone interview from her home in Park
Forest, Ill., told The Florida Times-Union his death was the
realization of the family's worst nightmare.
   ``We didn't want him to join. It was scary for us because you
never know what is going to happen,'' she said.
   Her son had a degree in business administration from the
University of Illinois and had planned to go to graduate school
after the Navy, relatives said.
   Officials said that at every muster since the body was found, no
one has been reported missing from the ship.
   ``We know exactly where everyone is at,'' Riccio said, adding
that at least a fourth of the ship's personnel is on duty at any
one time and others must check in daily unless they are on leave.
   The ship's disbursement office is a secure area ``like a bank''
and the combination of the safe was issued only to those with a
need to know, Riccio said.
   When the disbursing office door was discovered open Tuesday, an
immediate search for Prasad was called, said Lt. Cmdr. Tim Taylor.
Prasad had gotten off duty at midnight, then spent the night on
board in a stateroom, Taylor said.
   Investigators initially thought Prasad had absconded with the
money, but they quickly found his car still parked on the pier.
Shortly afterward, his body was found in an isolated storage area
one deck below his office.
   Navy officials said the time of death, an important element of
the investigation, hadn't been determined as far as they knew.

<HEAD>Hours After Jail Release On Rape Charge, Man Allegedly Attacks
Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARITA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man sexually assaulted a woman at
gunpoint less than three hours after he was released on a rape
charge, according to authorities who said the man was captured
following a two-hour chase.
   Lawrence David Gremminger, 49, was captured when his motorcycle
ran out of gas northwest of Santa Barbara, Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Deputy Roxanna Schuchman said Sunday.
   The chase with police, sheriff's deputies and the California
Highway Patrol reached speeds up to 100 mph, she said.
   Gremminger had been arrested Friday for investigation of rape
and posted $10,000 bail Saturday, Ms. Schuchman said.
   He then began knocking on doors in a Santa Clarita Valley
residential area, asking housewives if their husbands were home and
saying he needed help repairing a disabled motorcycle, the deputy
said.
   At one house, he pulled a gun on a 46-year-old woman and forced
her to perform a sex act, Ms. Schuchman said.
   The woman was able to break free and run for help, and two
neighbors chased the man in their car. They alerted Los Angeles
police officers who followed him into Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties before he ran out of gas and surrendered after a brief
standoff.
   Gremminger was being held Sunday on $250,000 bail for
investigation of sexual assault, assault with a deadly weapon and
numerous vehicle code violations, Schuchman said.

<TEXT>
   The fire-damaged Scandinavian Star was being towed
into port here so federal investigators can look for the cause of
an engine-room blaze that cut short a Mexican cruise.
   The ship could arrive as early as today at the home base of its
operators, SeaEscape Ltd., the National Transportation Safety Board
said.
   A preliminary inspection showed that the fire ``cooked'' wiring
in the ship's engine room, said William P. Fannon, leader of the
four-member investigative team.
   Once the ship is in Miami, NTSB investigators hope to rig bright
lights and ventilating fans in the engine room, which is currently
lit by dim lights from an auxiliary power unit.
   ``We want to develop a scenario of what happened,'' Fannon said.
``We're going to examine everything because the probable cause can
come from any one of a number of indicators.''
   The fire broke out Wednesday morning when the Star was about 35
miles northeast of the Yucatan peninsula. The ship was returning to
St. Petersburg from a three-day cruise to Cozumel, Mexico.
   The ship was towed to Cancun, and its 447 passengers were flown
back to Florida late Thursday.
   Fannon said the investigation will include interviews with crew
members and passengers.
   As the ship was being towed, more than 260 crew members relaxed
on deck chairs, Fannon said.
   But he said the crew were hardly enjoying a vacation. Because of
electrical damage, the Star had no water for showers.
   ``There is also no air conditioning,'' Fannon said. ``It's quite
uncomfortable.''

<HEAD>Couple Challenging Farm Rescue Law To Buy Back Farm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WORTHINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borrowers' rights provisions of the
farm credit foreclosure law are being tested by a couple's attempt
to buy back the farm they lost in foreclosure.
   A class action lawsuit in federal court by James and Maureen
Leckband could affect the sales of hundreds of farms that the
Federal Land Bank of St. Paul has taken from delinquent borrowers.
   The farm credit rescue law, which took effect Jan. 6, says that
when federal land banks decide to sell farms, they must give former
owners 15 days to buy back the land. The Leckbands' case is viewed
as a test of what the price should be.
   A public sale of their 320-acre farm near Worthington was
interrupted Friday with word that the lawsuit had been filed in St.
Paul, leaving confusion about the validity of the sale.
   The Leckbands claim they are entitled to buy the farm at its
current appraised value. The bank maintains the land is worth the
maximum offer it draws from interested buyers.
   The difference can be significant now that farmland values are
rising. Expectations that prices will climb can generate bids well
over appraisal estimates.
   Attorneys for the bank said they had not seen the complaint and
would not comment specifically on the case.
   But in general, ``We think fair market value is what somebody is
willing to pay for it under a competitive bidding process,'' said
William Collins, general counsel for the St. Paul District of Farm
Credit Services, which includes the bank.
   In addition to the specific issue of the Leckbands' rights, the
suit seeks to place responsibility with national Farm Credit
Administration officials for interpreting the law evenly throughout
the country. The Leckbands' attorney, James Massey, said the Omaha
District of the Farm Credit Administration has given borrowers
rights his clients are seeking.
   The suit names several national and local FCS officials, as well
as the bank.
   The Leckbands, who raise crops and livestock, borrowed $316,800
between 1980 and 1983, according to the complaint. After they fell
behind on their payments, the bank foreclosed on Jan. 13, 1987. The
Leckbands were allowed to keep the property during a one-year
redemption period.
   On Feb. 26, the Leckbands, citing the new law, demanded the bank
allow them to buy back 240 acres at the appraised value. According
to the complaint, the bank said the property would be sold through
a public competitive bidding process in which the Leckbands could
participate.
   The bank specified minimum acceptable bids that exceeded recent
appraisals by $13,500, the complaint said.

   David Grigg was miffed when his
11-year-old son pointed what he thought was a toy bazooka at him _
then was stunned to find out it really was a live anti-tank rocket
launcher.
   Grigg said he was working on a car Sunday afternoon when he saw
his son, Dennis, pointing the weapon at him.
   ``I walked over to tell him not to point toy guns at people,''
Grigg said. ``Then I found out it was a real one.''
   Grigg, who once served with an artillery unit in the army, said
he looked down the barrel of the weapon and saw something inside.
   ``I decided not to take any chances and called the sheriff's
department,'' he said.
   The Sangamon County Sheriff's Department called for a bomb
disposal unit, which identified the weapon as a LAW anti-tank
rocket launcher, said Gary Mack, spokesman for the bomb unit.
   The bomb squad X-rayed the weapon, and determined it to be a
live weapon with the firing pin intact, Mack said. Police then
transported it to a gun club, where it was detonated.
   Grigg said his son had been playing with the live weapon in the
house for 1{ days before he noticed it.
   ``He thought it was a toy,'' Grigg said.
   Authorities were trying to find out where the weapon came from.
   Grigg said his son got it from a friend who found it in his
father's pickup truck.
   Grigg said that boy's father is a trash collector who had gotten
the weapon from another man who had been storing it in an old
refrigerator and wanted it taken to a trash dump.

<HEAD>Conte, Honey Producers Battle Over Federal Support Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a honey of a fight on Capitol Hill,
and Rep. Silvio O. Conte is in the middle of the stirred up beehive.
   The Massachusetts Republican is waging a one-man battle against
beekeepers over the government's 38-year-old honey support program.
   ``I found these entitlements to be a classic example of wasteful
federal spending,'' Conte said in an interview. ``We now have a
federal program that encourages producers to have every single drop
of honey subsidized.''
   The Agriculture Department's honey support program was created
in 1950. Sugar rationing and the need for beeswax for waterproofing
ammunitions and equipment during World War II had bolstered the
honey business, and the end of the war hurt the once-prosperous
producers.
   The post-war program was used sparingly for the first 30 years.
Companies would give the government honey in exchange for a loan,
then redeem the loan and put the stored honey on the market when
demand went up.
   But during the 1980s, world honey supplies outpaced demand,
causing prices to drop. At about the same time, China began
flooding U.S. markets with less expensive honey, along with Mexico,
Canada and Argentina.
   ``We became a dumping ground,'' said Richard Adee, president of
the American Honey Producers Association Inc. and owner of a Bruce,
S.D., honey farm that he says is the largest in the world.
   Domestic producers began relying more and more heavily on the
federal supports. Some producers now regularly obtain federal loans
only to default on them later, leaving the government with tons of
honey as collateral.
   Adee defends the program as necessary to keep domestic producers
afloat.
   ``Everybody thinks this is a gravy train, but we've lost 20
percent of our industry in the past five years,'' he said.
   To Conte, the program ``has ballooned out of control.''
   ``We have to attack the program for what it is and not what it
was. It's a free ride now,'' he said.
   In 1986, Conte successfully capped the amount of money that
could be put under loan and forfeited by each company at $250,000.
   But honey-industry supporters in Congress, led by Sen. John
Melcher, D-Mont., removed the cap in the waning hours of Congress
last year.
   Without the cap, an estimated 200 million pounds of honey will
be subsidized at about 25 cents a pound this year _ approximately
double the annual amount that was subsidized under the limitation,
Conte said.
   The Agriculture Department, which supported the cap and decried
its removal, estimates the unlimited loans and forfeitures will
cost the government an extra $6.1 million over the next four years.
But Adee said a 2-cent a pound reduction in the buy-back price will
keep costs down.
   Conte, a 15-term congressman and the top Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, has vowed to unleash another attack on
the honey industry this year.
   The American Beekeeping Federation, a lobbying group, is ready
to fight back. Last month, the federation sent out a fund-raising
letter warning of Conte's wrath.
   ``The changes in the honey support program at the last moment
during the preparation of the reconcillation budget for 1988 has
Rep. Silvio Conte mad, no _ furious,'' the group's executive
committee warned in a Feb. 10 letter. ``Rep. Conte is out for
revenge and he will try to kill the support program for 1989 and
forever.''
   In a frank assessment of its 1987 success and fear in 1988, the
federation said: ``There were some big bucks and time spent in
Washington to change the program, but those are insignificant
compared to what we will need in 1988 to save the program.''
   Conte said he will be satisfied with reinstituting the loan cap.
   ``I don't think I can get rid of the whole program. I'd love to,
but I've been around here a long time. I'm realistic,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commercial actors and announcers nationwide
were ordered late Sunday to strike.
   ``Unfortunately, no new negotiations have been scheduled at this
time,'' a hot-line message to union members in Los Angeles said
late Sunday.
   Representatives of the Screen Actors Guild and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists and advertisers could
not be reached for comment late Sunday.
   ``The strike will begin as planned at 12:01 a.m. this Monday,
March 21st,'' the union hot-line recording said, adding that
members shouldn't renew or reinstate any old commercials.
   ``Beginning at that time, no member of SAG or AFTRA may audition
for or perform in any television or radio commercial,'' it said.
``Our fellow actors will also place picket lines in New York,
Chicago, Miami, Honolulu and other cities to follow next week.''
   The advertising firm of Ogilvy and Mather was targeted by
pickets in Los Angeles and Honolulu. In New York City, strikers
were told to set up picket lines at General Motors Plaza during a
GM board meeting.
   In Chicago, the agencies of Leo Burnett, J. Walter Thompson, DDB
Needham Worldwide and Tatham-Laird and Kudner were targeted for
union picketing.
   Talks on a new three-year pact between the commercial performers
and the Joint Policy Committee of the American Association of
Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers
began Jan. 11 in New York City and broke off March 7.
   Union negotiators received a 93 percent strike authorization
from members just before contract talks broke off.
   The contract dispute centers on performers' demands for a share
of money made from commercials broadcast on cable television
stations and advertisers' attempts to reduce union cost-of-living
adjustments.
   The unions recently sent telegrams to all presidential
candidates warning them of the strike and offering production
waivers if they agree to interim contracts conceding the demands
turned down by advertising negotiators.
   The interim contract offer was given to regular advertisers as
well, and as many as 40 have said they will seek them, according to
the union.
   The advertisers' negotiator, John McGuinn, had urged agncies to
resist signing interim contracts, although he said a strike could
last as long as six months.
   The joint SAG-AFTRA membership is more than 100,000. The unions
negotiate together on the commercial contract. Union actors will be
barred from auditioning or appearing in commercials, but can work
in films and on television shows.

<HEAD>Underground Economy Surfaces at Riga Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos upcoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet underground economy has poked through
the surface at Riga Market, a weekend jungle of moonlighters,
fast-ruble artists and curious consumers brought out by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic reforms.
   ``You can get anything you want here; the price is the only
thing,'' said Lyonya. The curly-haired 17-year-old surveyed the
open-air sales of imitation Western clothes, wool and fur hats,
coats and other goods at the market in northern Moscow near the
Riga train station.
   A cigarette dangling from his mouth, Lyonya moments before had
approached a Westerner and offered to illegally exchange money.
   Thousands of shoppers jostle and slide through snow and ice to
trade their rubles for goods of uncertain origin. A knee-length red
winter coat devoid of any labeling was priced at 250 rubles, $400
at the official exchange rate.
   One hundred rubles ($160) could buy a jean skirt with the
``SFINKS'' brand on a triangular metal tab displaying the ancient
Egyptian monument. The average worker earns about 200 rubles a
month.
   The market illustrates the opportunities and abuses of
Gorbachev's drive to loosen some of the controls on the state-run
economy, as well as the pent-up demand for anything Western.
   Black-market money traders and speculators who sell prized
Western goods and Soviet imitations long have flourished
underground at tourist hotels, among taxi drivers and elsewhere.
   But the reforms started by Gorbachev, the Communist Party
leader, have given traders a new place to operate, mingled with
legal moonlighters who produce a few items by hand to earn extra
rubles.
   Gorbachev said in January that 300,000 Soviets drive taxis,
repair apartments, run restaurants and pump gas outside the
official economy under new laws allowing citizens more freedom to
work for themselves or form a cooperative.
   But many Soviets complain cooperative goods and services are too
expensive and those who work in them are out to make a quick
profit. Meeting with factory workers several weeks ago, Gorbachev
praised honest initiative but said authorities would not permit
``outright money-grabbing.''
   A draft of a new law published recently indicates the government
is planning to tax both the profits of cooperatives and the incomes
of their members.
   On weekdays, Riga Market differs little from other farmers'
markets scattered around Moscow. But on Saturdays and Sundays it
blossoms with the booths of several thousand merchants.
   The merchants say they work for themselves or are members of
cooperatives formed under the new law. But they are reluctant to
discuss their affairs, apparently either because they are operating
illegally or because public disapproval makes them nervous.
   The newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, aimed at young readers,
said in a recent article that Riga Market draws young people like a
magnet and that ``crimes are committed here every day, and in no
small quantity.''
   Although Moscow needs such places, Riga Market should be limited
to 300-400 sellers and officials must control the activity, the
newspaper said.
   Lyonya said Western jeans like those he was wearing are
available from speculators for about 100 rubles, and Western-made
boots cost 150 rubles to 200 rubles ($240 to $320).
   A few minutes later, another young man approached the same
Western correspondent and asked if he had a jacket, boots, or pants
to sell. Told no, he followed behind and asked, ``Do you have any
friends?''
   Lyonya said a friend of his buys sweatshirts at the official
price of three rubles, puts an English-language emblem saying
``Manufactured Exclusively for SMASH'' on them and sells them for
35 rubles.
   The seller, who had a half-dozen shirts hanging from a line, was
asked how many such shirts he could sell in a weekend. He refused
to answer and said the query was ``a provocative question.''
   Valery, a Muscovite with several days' growth of beard and a
wide-brim black hat, said he can buy the labeling and everything he
needs for the ``SFINKS'' denim line from associates at the market.
He also had for sale two children's sweatsuits, one with Walt
Disney's Bambi emblazoned on it, for 20 rubles (about $32).
   He said he sells in Moscow occasionally but prefers the Soviet
Far East or Siberia. ``It's too crowded here. People have more
money there because they earn higher salaries,'' he said.
   He said his store job offers him three days off for every one he
works, giving him plenty of time to sew the garments. He declined
to go into more detail about his business and refused to be
photographed.
   Moskovsky Komsomolets said one morning's police records showed a
young Russian was arrested after selling an imported jeans jacket
for 120 rubles ($190). Another was selling packs of Marlboro
cigarettes for 8 rubles (about $12.80).
   A 12-year-old boy was found selling things he stole from his
parents, the newspaper said.
   ``The main heroes of these stories are basically young guys and
girls, young Communists,'' the newspaper said. ``Do they need these
lessons?''

<HEAD>Arab Americans Parlay Palestinian Uprising Into Political Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab Americans are parlaying the Palestinian
revolt against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
into a surge of charitable contributions and domestic political
gains.
   Last month, the United Palestine Appeal and other charitable
organizations raised $300,000 to help Palestinians continue a
three-month resistance campaign that has captured the world's
attention, according to David Sadd, executive director of the
National Association of Arab Americans.
   This compares with some $1 million these groups raised in all of
1987, and does not include the checks sent by American Palestinians
to their relatives in the occupied territories, said Sadd, whose
group is a major lobbyist for an estimated 2.3 million Arab
Americans.
   ``There's real pride about the courageous Palestinians. We want
to help them go on,'' said Sadd. ``If they can't work, we want to
make sure they have enough resources to continue the resistance.''
   A civil disobedience campaign combined with intimidation by
extremists have kept many of the 1.5 million Palestinians under
occupation away from their jobs in Israel.
   Sadd said leaders of major Arab American organizations are
discussing establishing a central resource to identify areas of
need in the West Bank and Gaza and to coordinate distribution of
medicine, blankets and other items.
   The organizations also are trying to link up with such
established charitable groups as Catholic Relief to help channel
their aid in order to prevent Israel from blocking the funds, Sadd
said.
   The revolt in which 100 Palestinian Arabs have been killed has
provided a renewed national consciousness in the mostly U.S.-born
community whose parents or grandparents came from Lebanon, Syria,
Egypt and Palestine.
   Unlike the 6 million American Jews, many of whom link their
religious and national identity to Israel, most American Arabs have
tended to identify less with their country of origin than with
village and family groups.
   ``Unlike the Jews, we don't have Zionism. We have always felt
that this is our home,'' said James Zogby, executive director of
the Arab American Institute.
   But in recent years, Zogby's organization and others have
modeled themselves on long-established Jewish lobbying and
charitable groups in an effort to unite the community and organize
grassroots support to influence the political scene.
   Last year, the Arab American Institute launched a project to
elect Arab American candidates locally and nationally and to
pressure other candidates to confront the sensitive issue of
statehood for the Palestinians.
   The West Bank and Gaza uprising and the harsh methods Israel is
using to quell it have given Arab Americans more confidence, he
said.
   But other Arab Americans acknowledge that the inroads are
slight, and may not be lasting. A wave of Arab American indignation
over the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by
Israeli-allied militiamen in the Sabra and Chatillah refugee camps
fizzled out.
   Community leaders note that Arab Americans are better organized
now than they were then. The longer the revolt draws on, the more
entrenched and sustained will be the support for it, they maintain.
   Rep. Nick Rahall, a West Virginia Democrat of Lebanese descent,
warned that ``while Arab Americans are making gains from the
uprising, the question is whether they can translate it into
meaningful support in Congress or in the presidential race.''
   Congress traditionally has been strongly supportive of Israel
and has not spoken out against the Israeli killings and beatings.
Most presidential candidates have been vague when asked their views.
   The exception is Jesse Jackson, who has drawn broad support from
Arab Americans for his condemnation of the Israeli methods and for
his longtime support of a role for the Palestine Liberation
Organization in Mideast peace talks.
   Arab Americans have contributed $175,000 to his campaign, Zogby
said.
   Since the Palestinian unrest began Dec. 8, Arab Americans have
conducted demonstrations and vigils around the country, also
sending thousands of letters to congressmen and presidential
hopefuls.
   Abdeen Jabara, head of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination
Committee, said he was pleasantly surprised when he was invited by
two groups of congressmen to brief them on his recent trip to the
West Bank. His previous attempts to get congressional attention for
the Palestinian cause failed, he said.
   ``But the changes are still very slight,'' he said. ``Public
opinion is with us, but congressional attitudes don't reflect
this.''

   Twenty-nine years ago, a Russian clergyman
started a unique bilingual secondary school with unlimited funds on
deposit at the ``bank of faith and hope.''
   Actually, it had $23. Today, St. Sergius High School has about
$150,000 less than it needs to keep going and the Rev.
Archimandrite Anthony Grabbe, its founder, says it might have to
close this week unless it raises the money.
   ``The sum of $150,000 means life or death to us,'' says Grabbe,
who recently cut short some church work in the Middle East to try
to put the school on firmer financial ground.
   An emergency committee will try to raise the shortfall in the
school's $500,000 annual budget. Among its members will be designer
Oleg Cassini, born a Russian count, Grabbe said.
   It's not the first time the tiny school has faced an uncertainty.
   In 1974, it was $40,000 in the red and Grabbe prepared to shut
it. But then, a dying Russian emigre unknown to Grabbe donated his
life savings of $40,000.
   In 1981, when the school again teetered near extinction, a
wealthy woman Grabbe met 15 years earlier sent him $100,000. In
addition, the school has received help from Cassini, former
Democratic presidential candidate Bruce Babbitt and Yoko Ono, among
others.
   The timely donations and teachers who work without pay in a
pinch have kept alive Grabbe's dream: that students in grades 3 to
12 study English and Russian cultures together.
   But Grabbe says he cannot understand why the school is not
thriving now, since there is greater demand for Russian experts as
Soviet-American relations warm.
   He describes the school as the only fully accredited
Russian-English secondary school in the nation and one of the very
few that seeks to preserve the culture of czarist Russia. Grabbe is
not a fan of the Soviets, and has said he considers it a passing
phase in Russia's history.
   Harley Balzer, director of the Russian Area Studies Program at
Georgetown University in Washington, said he was not surprised to
learn of St. Sergius' financial woes.
   ``We are not a nation that has traditionally regarded studying
other people's languages as a high priority,'' he said.
   The school, which once enrolled 100 students but now has only
27, offers a complete program of Russian language, history and
culture besides a standard program taught in English.
   The school is located in a mansion on Manhattan's Upper East
Side. The classrooms are small, the desks and laboratory equipment
old. The school's lease runs out next year.
   It was first established for youngsters from the New York
Russian emigrant community to transmit Russia's heritage. But it
broadened its program in 1963 to include non-Russian students, said
Grabbe, an official of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia
who oversees Orthodox congregations in several Middle Eastern
nations.
   Its enrollment is now about half Russian; the rest is composed
of a variety of backgrounds, including Moslems, blacks, Jews,
Chinese, Japanese and Catholic, Grabbe said. Some graduates have
gone on to work in U.S. diplomatic positions.
   A Soviet emigrant student who transferred to the school this
year said she is learning much more than in public school because
of a higher teacher-student ratio and intensive instruction.
   ``I don't have any place to go if it closes down,'' said the
15-year-old, Vadim Korkhov.
   As a result of the budget shortfall, the 11th and 12th grades
have been dropped, enrollment has declined because parents are
uncertain of the school's future and teachers have not been paid
since December, Grabbe said.
   Tuition, which ranges from $1,800 to $4,000 a year depending on
grade level, makes up only about one-quarter of the budget.
   ``It's incredible that this situation exists with the current
political climate,'' he said.
   But if all fails, he said with a smile, ``There's always the
bank of faith and hope.''

<HEAD>Record Number Of Hospitals Closed In 1987, AHA says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising costs last year forced a record 79
hospitals to close their doors, the American Hospital Association
reported today.
   The closings, most in hospitals with fewer than 100 beds, were
heavy in four southern states but were evenly split overall between
rural and urban areas, the hospital group said.
   ``Hospitals that barely break even or continually lose money
cannot buy needed medical equipment, replace deteriorating
buildings or add important services,'' Carol McCarthy, president of
the Chicago-based organization, said in a statement.
   Federal Medicare payments, which represent 40 percent of a
hospital's income, may be partly to blame for the closings, she
added.
   ``Hospitals saw the price of goods and services they purchase
rise 22 percent between 1984 and 1988 while Medicare raised the
prices its pays hospitals ... only 11 percent,'' she said.
   Of the 79 hospitals that closed in 30 states, 35 were
for-profit, 30 were non-profit and 14 were government-owned, the
association said.
   Twenty-five hospitals closed in four states: Arkansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.
   Most of the closed hospitals ranged from 25 beds to 99.
   ``In the past year, nearly seven in 10 rural hospitals in this
country lost money caring for patients, and 50 percent of urban
hospitals operated in the red,'' Ms. McCarthy said.
   Jan Shulman, an AHA spokeswoman, said the 42 hospitals that
closed in 1986 was the previous record.
   In addition to the 79 hospitals that shut down, 17 speciality
outlets also closed in 13 states in 1987. Most were rehabilitation
or long-term care centers, said the association.

   Despite the AIDS-related death of pornographic
film star John Holmes, industry officials insist the adult film
business is AIDS-free and that precautions such as AIDS testing are
widespread.
   Concerned about the adverse publicity surrounding Holmes' death,
sex film producers and performers said last week that AIDS and
venereal disease are virtually non-existent among sex-film stars.
   Industry concerns were heightened by a statement by Holmes'
24-year-old wife, Laurie.
   ``It's my belief that AIDS is running rapidly through the adult
entertainment business,'' said Mrs. Holmes, who once acted in porn
films under the name Misty Dawn and whose husband died March 13 of
a form of pneumonia brought on by acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Ron Sullivan, a sex-film producer and president of the
industry's 350-member Adult Video Association, said Mrs. Holmes
``is completely wrong.''
   Industry figures argued they have avoided AIDS by testing actors
for infection and making sure the men use condoms and anti-viral
spermicides. They said the small inner circle of pornographic
performers insist on the safety measures.
   Sullivan knew of no sex-film star who has contracted AIDS. It
was not known how Holmes got the disease, but in addition to his
14,000 claimed sexual encounters over the years, he used
intravenous drugs, which also can spread AIDS.
   Nina Hartley, who starred in such adult fare as ``Feminist Porno
Actress'' and ``Intellectual Tinker Bell,'' gave the porn industry
a clean bill of health.
   ``There is absolutely no evidence AIDS is rampant,'' said the
27-year-old San Francisco actress, who has appeared in adult films
for four years. ``AIDS testing is pretty common, but it's not
mandatory.''
   Ms. Hartley suggested actors would jeopardize chances for key
roles if they insisted on testing for their co-stars. She said she
knows of only a few sex stars who demand AIDS testing.
   ``Most of the veterans and people who have worked for quite a
while really keep health conscious,'' porno star Angel Kelly said.
``In the last six months we've even begun printing up a newsletter
to all the actors and actresses with health tips.''
   Sullivan and Ms. Hartley said there are only about 100 active
sex-film stars, and they are cautious.
   ``We are capable of taking care of ourselves and we want the
public to know that,'' said Sullivan, who organized a voluntary
testing program for adult film actors. His Los Angeles-based
association is paying the $75 test costs.
   ``We're doing it because of the adverse publicity (after Holmes'
death) saying that the industry is inundated with AIDS,'' he said.
   Movie sex star Barbii said she gets tested regularly and insists
that her partners be tested.
   ``Most girls don't take (AIDS) seriously,'' Barbii said.
``People don't talk about it _ it's kind of hush.''
   But Ms. Hartley counters that fear of AIDS and venereal diseases
permeates the industry, and that prevention, detection and
discretion have gained industry acceptance.
   ``Safe sex scenes are more prevalent now,'' she said. ``Not
every scene uses a condom and you won't see it (condom use) take
over the industry, but more actors are using them.
   The AIDS virus damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to death from infections and cancer.
   It can be spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, or transfusions of infected blood or blood
products.

<HEAD>Study: Too Much `Mainstreaming' of Deaf Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deaf children receive an inferior education
caused in part by a misguided emphasis on placing them in regular
public schools, a government commission reported today.
   ``The quality of education available to children who are deaf is
poor,'' said the Commission on Education of the Deaf.
   The 13-member panel, created by Congress in 1986, said more
attention must be paid to deaf students who are not college bound.
   The commission's 144-page report, ``Toward Equality: Education
of the Deaf,'' says the U.S. Department of Education has pushed too
hard to ``mainstream'' deaf children into regular public school
classes instead of special schools or centers devoted to the deaf.
   ``The state of the art in the education of persons who are deaf
is characterized by inappropriate priorities and inadequate
resources,'' said the commission, chaired by Frank G. Bowe, a
regional commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration.
   Two-thirds of the commission members are themselves deaf or hard
of hearing, including Bowe. Actress Nanette Fabray MacDougall was
also on the panel.
   The report recommended changes in the management of Gallaudet
University, including appointment of a deaf majority to its board
of trustees. That was a student demand in the recent protests that
forced the naming of the first deaf president at Gallaudet.
   The Gallaudet protests and the commission report spring from the
same philosophy: that the deaf want more control over their own
affairs and full recognition of deaf culture, including American
Sign Language, their primary means of communication.
   The commission said significant strides have been made in
educating the deaf since 1965, the last time a federal panel
recommended improvements.
   But it said, ``the actual implementation of these initiatives
has been inadequate and sometimes misguided, and that progress has
at best been spotty and sporadic.''
   ``All too often,'' the report said, changes ``turned out to be
more well-meaning than effective.''
   ``The federal government does much more for high-achieving deaf
students than for those whom the nation's schools have failed. The
ironic result is that those who need the most receive the least,''
it said.
   It said schools should ``pay attention to educational content
rather than mere placement _ to what is taught rather than where it
is taught.''
   The report said 95 percent of all deaf children are
``prelingually deaf'' _ left without hearing at birth or deprived
of it in infancy _ and the United States is not doing a good enough
job identifying them soon after birth.
   ``Many children have hearing impairments that go undiagnosed and
untreated for as long as three to six years,'' it said. ``The
average age of identification for profoundly deaf children in the
United States is reported as 2{ years,'' compared to seven to nine
months in Israel.
   Ninety percent of deaf children have hearing parents.
   The commission said most cases of deafness result from unknown
causes. More than a quarter of the cases are linked to heredity,
maternal rubella or German measles and meningitis. Children can
also be deafened by infections, high fevers and otitis media.
   The number of deaf children in U.S. schools has dropped from
46,279 in 1977-78 to 36,017 in 1985-86. The 22 percent decrease is
due primarily to the aging of students born during a rubella
epidemic in 1965-66.
   The commission said that bulge of deaf children growing up in
the 1970s was bigger than residential schools could handle, and
helped shift the pendulum ``toward accommodating deaf children
closer to home in public schools.''
   But even in regular schools, the deaf children are often
isolated from their hearing peers for classwork. The commission
said only 53 percent of deaf students in regular schools
``experience any degree of academic integration.''
   The commission said that although lip-reading provides some
language learning cues, ``at most only 40 percent of the sounds
produced in the English language are visible on the lips.'' Hearing
aids can help some, but ``other young deaf children may understand
as little as 5 percent of what is said to them.''
   A residential school gives the child access _ for 16 hours a day
instead of six hours _ to ``highly trained specialists who
understand the fundamental principles of developmental
psycholinguistics,'' the commission said.
   It said schools with classes just for the deaf ``are the least
restrictive environment appropriate for many children.''
   The commission acknowledged some deaf children ``benefit from
education in regular classes,'' but said parents should have the
option to place their child in schools for the deaf.
   Some 145 U.S. colleges offer programs for the deaf, including
Gallaudet and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, which
together receive $71 million in federal subsidies and educate 3,500
students.
   But the only regular colleges that regularly enroll more than
100 deaf students are California State University at Northridge,
St. Paul Technical Institute and Los Angeles Trade Technical
College.

<HEAD>Big Step Toward Harnessing Fusion Reaction Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have ignited a nuclear fusion
reaction in tiny pellets of hydrogen by using radiation from an
exploding nuclear weapon, raising hopes for an unlimited source of
energy, a newspaper reported today.
   The successful experiment, viewed as a major advance toward
determining the possibility of harnessing small-scale fusion,
occurred about two years ago at an underground nuclear test site in
Nevada, according to The New York Times.
   The U.S. government kept it secret because it did not want
foreign countries to know about it, but some details have been
discussed at scientific conferences, the newspaper said.
   While revealing nuclear fusion as a potentially highly potent
energy source, the results have triggered a dispute over how
experiments in small-scale fusion, or ``microfusion,'' should
proceed, the newspaper said.
   Scientists have long tried to tame nuclear fusion reactions, in
the hope they could eventually lead to an unlimited and relatively
cheap source of electricity. In fusion reactions, which are found
in stars and hydrogen bombs, atoms are joined together to release
energy; they contrast with fission reactions in which atoms are
split rather than combined.
   In most cases, the scientists have tried to use concentrated
light from giant lasers to trigger a fusion reaction, but
laser-based fusion has never proved successful. The secret
experiment in Nevada, the Times said, instead used X-ray radiation
from a nuclear weapon directed at tiny fuel pellets.
   The prototype fuel pellets are glass capsules filled with
hydrogen isotopes, the Times said. A dozen pellets can easily fit
on the head of a pin, but their power output could be equivalent to
hundreds of pounds of high explosives, the newspaper said.
   The secret achievement required more energy than expected,
scientists told said.
   Some scientists say the laser-based microfusion program needs a
radical change of course, while others say the nuclear approach,
while unconventional, was a milestone that generated valuable data
that will help make fusion practical, the newspaper said.
   Nuclear fusion could be used to develop antimissile weapons and
perhaps become a cheap source of boundless electric power, the
report said.
   The Times said the experiments were believed to have never been
publicly disclosed. It noted that last September Sheldon Kahalas,
director of the nation's microfusion effort, told a Princeton
University conference that the effort had reached a ``historical
turning point,'' but refused to elaborate.

<HEAD>Defector Pilot Says Noriega Stockpiling Cuban Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega is
assembling a stash of Cuban-supplied arms outside of his nation's
military bases so his loyalists can reach them anytime, says a
Panamanian pilot who defected last week.
   Maj. Augusto Villalaz, who was one of Noriega's personal pilots,
says he flew three shipments of arms to Panama from Cuba and that
Noriega planned to import 500,000 pounds of weapons.
   ``He located the arms outside the military installations, and he
can handle (them) with his people when he wants,'' Villalaz said
Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   Villalaz said Ortega's well-placed loyalists and big stash of
Cuban weapons will enable him to remain in power, if he chooses,
longer than U.S. officials seem to think.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is among those predicting a
quick end to Noriega's rule, claiming Sunday that the Panamanian
military is ``cracking open'' around Noriega.
   ``The situation is that Noriega must leave sooner or later. The
sooner the better,'' Shultz said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   Shultz said U.S. indictments against Noriega on drug trafficking
charges would not be dropped and Noriega could not have any say
about the government that would run Panama after his departure.
   ``What he has to do is leave, and he should settle quickly
before the opportunity that is there before him, to go to Spain,
should disappear,'' Shultz said. Spain has offered Noriega
political asylum on the condition that the United States not seek
his extradition on the drug charges.
   ``Increasingly, the military is cracking open and making it
clear that they want him to leave,'' Shultz said, citing the
defection last week of Noriega's personal pilots, Villalaz and Maj.
Ramon Adames.
   Villalaz said last week's coup attempt against Noriega failed
because an officer who was supposed ``to secure the commander of
troops'' protecting Noriega's headquarters failed to do so. He did
not give any other details about the coup attempt.
   Villalaz acknowledged a Noriega claim that four of the five
officers involved in the plot against him received training in the
United States last month, but he said no U.S. agency was involved
in the coup attempt.
   In a telephone interview, Raul St. Malo, minister counselor with
the Panamanian embassy, said the pilots told anti-Noriega embassy
officials that 70 percent of military officers supported the coup
attempt, but that Noriega has loyalists guarding the military's
firepower. He said the anti-Noriega personnel include captains,
majors and colonels in all branches of the service.
   St. Malo said other defections of high-ranking officers are
expected ``very soon.'' He declined to give any details of the
pilots' defection.
   Villalaz described Noriega as a ``very complicated'' man who
doesn't talk very much. But he said Noriega is a strong leader and
has a hold on military people in key locations around the country.
   ``He's fairly secure because he has the main places in the
(country) with the weapon power ... the military weight,'' Villalaz
said.
   Asked if he thought Noriega would ever agree to go into exile in
Spain, the pilot said, ``I don't think so. He's a very strong man.''
   Villalaz said that on Noriega's orders he flew three shipments
of weapons from Cuba, stashing them in three locations around the
country. He said 16 such flights were planned with a total of
500,000 pounds of weapons to be put in place outside regular
Panamanian military installations.
   National security adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, also
interviewed on ABC, speculated that Noriega could be intending to
use the Soviet-made arms to wage an insurgency of his own after he
is deposed or for use elsewhere in Central America.
   But he said he believes Noriega's future is dim.
   ``He will leave, sooner or later,'' Powell said. ``We will
continue to apply pressure. He is a tough individual. He will take
every opportunity available to him to stay in power.''
   Powell said he had no information about a report in Sunday's
editions of The Washington Post that federal law enforcement
officials wanted to indict Noriega eight years ago on charges of
illegally buying and transporting weapons but stalled out of fear
it would upset Panama.
   ``We had evidence to indict him for conspiracy, but ... the
Justice Department didn't want it,'' Donald Kimbler, a former agent

   In a separate interview Sunday, Panama's U.S. ambassador, Juan

Noriega is in his last days of power and would fall this week.
   ``He's not governing now, so either the military will continue

an interview on Cable News Network's ``Newsmaker Sunday.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Plans Suit To Close PLO's UN Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department will seek an
``immediately enforceable'' court order to force the Palestine
Liberation Organization to vacate its New York office, a department
spokesman says.
   Spokesman Patrick Korten said Sunday that the department is
planning to file suit in U.S. District Court in New York to force
the closing of the PLO observer mission at the United Nations.
   ``We're ready to go ahead and file the papers if they don't
close the mission voluntarily,'' Korten said.
   The United States has declared the PLO a terrorist organization,
but the United Nations recognizes it as the only legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people.
   The PLO served notice last week that it planned to defy any U.S.
effort to shut the mission, which is in a New York City townhouse.
   Korten said the department probably will file the suit by
Wednesday, depending on how long the paperwork takes.
   ``The chances are it would be within a day or two if they are
not out,'' Korten said. ``We are hoping those who walk into the
office to look for them would find them gone. If that's not the
case, then we would proceed with legal action.''
   The Justice Department announced March 11 that it planned to
enforce the Anti-Terrorism Act passed by Congress last year by
going to court to close the mission. That act takes effect Monday.
   Korten said the suit would seek an ``immediately enforceable''
court order directing the PLO to vacate its offices in New York.
   In a failed effort to stop the legislation ordering the U.N.
mission closed, the State Department last year closed down the only
other PLO office in the United States, an information office in
Washington.

   Balancing 360 eggs on their ends may not be a
scientifically approved way of demonstrating the supposed powers of
the first day of spring. But don't tell that to performance artist
Donna Henes.
   About 200 people helped Henes balance the eggs at 4:39 a.m.
Sunday, the precise moment of the vernal equinox, one of two points
in the year when the sun crosses the equator and day and night are
equal.
   ``Considering the hour, more people showed up than I expected,''
she said. The egg balancing took place on a long table-like
platform at the South Street Seaport shopping area.
   According to Henes, balancing an egg on its end is an ancient
Chinese custom that brings good luck.
   Scientists are dubious whether eggs really do balance during the
equinox due to changes in the gravitational pull, but Henes is
convinced.
   ``It's funny, because I've asked a lot of scientists about it
and they say its impossible,'' Henes said. ``However, when I ask
them to join in the ritual and they see it happen, they become
instant believers.''
   Henes, who has been observing the egg-balancing ritual for the
past 13 years, said eggs are ancient symbols of fertility and
spring around the world. ``Easter is only one of many spring
holidays where the egg is used as a symbol of rebirth,'' she said.
   After balancing the eggs, the participants enjoyed them at a
breakfast prepared by one of the tourist attraction's restaurants.

   Two bratwurst makers here say they've
been inundated with long-distance orders since their business was
featured last week by a New York newspaper.
   However, Scott Poth and Scott Luchterhand of Poth's Meats say
their sudden popularity won't change things much _ at least not the
secret recipe.
   ``That came down from my grandmother on my mother's side of the
family,'' said Poth, 29.
   Poth operates the store his father, Henry, started some 40 years
ago, with the assistance of Luchterhand, his brother-in-law.
   Their store was one of 11 Sheboygan shops featured in a March 13
article in The New York Times, which called Sheboygan the ``wurst
city in the world.''
   ``The impact could really be significant,'' said Heather Clyde,
director of the city's Convention and Vistors Bureau. ``It could
really up attendance at our local bratwurst festivals.''
   Poth said he had more than a dozen orders from East Coast
residents last Monday, a day after the article appeared.
   But while mail-order sales are always welcomed, Poth said he
knows his most reliable market will always be in Sheboygan.
   ``Brat fries are just a primary part of life here,'' he said.
``All the fund-raisers? Brat fries. All the family picnics? Brat
fries.''

   High school students pose the
greatest menace at spring break time, said officials reeling from a
wild weekend that included a riot, four stabbings and the deaths of
two youths whose car plunged off a dock.
   ``That's our worst time, when the San Antonio high school
students are here,'' City Manager Gordon Beck said Sunday.
   Beaches were again packed with partying teen-agers early today.
An estimated 30,000 students were staying in this resort island
town near Corpus Christi, said Coast Guard spokesman Anthony E.
Lloyd.
   ``I think things are back to normal for a spring break, which is
in no way normal,'' Beck said.
   Authorities said mainly high school students appeared to be
involved in early Sunday's three-hour disturbance by 3,000 youths,
authorities said.
   ``What you have down there is a tremendous amount of
intoxication going on. All it takes sometimes is for someone to
bump into someone else. The crowd just turned into a riot,'' said
Officer Jim Kaelin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
   The disturbance began when a motorist struck a 16-year-old girl
on the beach and then attempted to leave, said Police Chief Don
Perkins. Angry youths began to attack the driver, but he was pulled
away by police.
   The youths then tipped over the man's car and torched it,
Perkins said.
   ``They stomped the car, broke all the glass out of it and
flipped it over,'' said Tom Frazier, 22, a University of Texas
student.
   More than 100 officers aided by tear gas and hovering Coast
Guard helicopters with searchlights worked to restore order.
   The accident victim was treated for minor injuries. The driver,
John Montanes, 26, of San Antonio, was charged with failure to stop
and render aid and was in jail Sunday night in lieu of $500 bond.
   Two police officers were injured and eight people, including one
accused of inciting a riot, were arrested as a result of the melee,
police said.
   Authorities reported at least four people were stabbed in
unrelated attacks and a car containing the bodies of two young men
was found in Corpus Christi Bay. About a mile from the riot site,
the car crashed through a barrier hours after the disturbance and
sank in water 20 to 25 feet deep, said Coast Guard spokesman
Anthony E. Lloyd in Corpus Christi.
   The victims' identities were not released.
   Perkins said all eight of his officers were on duty late Sunday.
   ``You never expect a riot,'' Perkins said. ``You don't want it
to occur, and with the cooperation of the students it won't occur.
However, last night we got no cooperation.''
   He said his officers felt seriously threatened at one point
during the melee.
   ``When bottles and cans are being thrown at you, you get to
feeling endangered,'' Perkins said.
   While most of the injured were treated and released Sunday, a
17-year-old stabbing victim remained hospitalized in satisfactory
condition today at AMI Coastal Bend hospital.

<TEXT>
   A group of moderate Baptists gathers tonight
for its second annual meeting, wondering if it will retain a place
in the fundamentalist-dominated Southern Baptist Convention that
sparked its formation.
   ``We are Southern Baptists, but we intend to hold up that flag
of religious liberty and we're going to yell ouch every time they
step on that principle and we're going to keep on yelling,'' said
the Rev. Jim Strickland, a Cartersville pastor who is a leader of
the Southern Baptist Alliance.
   Strickland said victories by moderates at some state Baptist
conventions last year indicate the Southern Baptist Convention's
annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas, this summer may be ``a
high-water mark ... a shootout at the O.K. Corral.''
   Nevertheless, Strickland said, this week's alliance meeting at
Mercer University is not a strategy session for moderates.
   ``The Southern Baptist Alliance is not a political organization.
... We are not going to do that footwork out there,'' although the
alliance supports those political efforts, he said.
   The alliance was formed in February 1987 in reaction to
fundamentalist actions as they gained control of the Southern
Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denominaton
with about 14.5 million members.
   Fundamentalists maintain that the Bible is without error in
historical and scientific as well as religious areas; moderates
hold there is room for interpretation.
   Fundamentalists have removed moderates from leadership
positions, including the presidency of Southeastern Baptist
Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C. In another instance, an employee of
one of the denomination's agencies says he was fired because he
said he believed Jews could go to heaven without accepting Jesus.
   The alliance has grown to include 34 churches with more than
20,000 members, plus about 2,500 other member whose churches do not
belong to the alliance. Strickland said the alliance is not
intended to be the nucleus of a new denomination.
   ``Our hope as members of the Southern Baptist Alliance is that
we can articulate Baptist philosophy _ not necessarily current
Southern Baptist philosophy _ about religious liberty. We want to
call Baptists who think religious freedom is important back to that
heritage,'' Strickland said.
   Strickland is pastor of Heritage Baptist Church, formed less
than a year ago, partly because of fundamentalist control of the
First Baptist Church of Cartersville, he said.
   Mercer University, supported by the Georgia Baptist Convention,
was itself the center of controversy last year when fundamentalists
mounted a campaign to gain control of the school, citing its
listing as a ``party school'' by Playboy magazine and the moderate
views of President R. Kirby Godsey.
   But the Georgia Baptist Convention last November defeated
efforts to remove Godsey. The action was seen at the time as one of
a series of victories by moderates in various state Baptist
conventions.

<HEAD>California Conservatives Endorse Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush won the
presidential endorsement of the conservative California Republican
Assembly even through Pat Robertson personally sought the nod of
the volunteer group.
   Robertson called the CRA _ the largest and most conservative of
California's grassroots Republican organizations _ the most
important GOP endorsing body in the nation in an enthusiastically
received appearance before it Saturday.
   But Bush's supporters stressed the inevitability of his
nomination and the need for conservatives to unify behind him. In
the Sunday vote, Bush picked up nearly all the supporters of Sen.
Bob Dole and Rep. Jack Kemp after their names were dropped from the
endorsement ballot.
   Bush led Robertson by 178-70 on the first CRA ballot, but failed
to win the required two-thirds for an endorsement because Dole had
34 votes and Kemp 33. Bush easily defeated Robertson to win the CRA
endorsement on a 231-81 second ballot.

<HEAD>Oregon Democrats Defeat Marijuana Plank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregon Democrats have rejected a plank in
their state party platform that would have called for reduced
criminal penalties for growing and possessing marijuana.
   In the past, state Democrats have approved platform planks
advocating both outright legalization of marijuana and lessening
criminal penalties, arguing that the money would be better spent
fighting ``hard'' drugs.
   ``We're cleaning up our act,'' James Klonoski, a past state
Democratic party chair, said after the marijuana plank was rejected
Sunday. ``In the old days, we used to embarrass our elected
officials. We don't do that anymore.''
   Tom Alexander, a Benton County state convention delegate who
wanted the marijuana plank in platform, said the main opposition
was from Gov. Neil Goldschmidt and other elected Democrats worried
about the party's image and the upcoming elections.
   ``The problem is that the Democratic party leaders, because the
Republicans have shifted so far to the right, think we have to play
to the Republican moderates for votes,'' Alexander said.

<HEAD>Gore Opposes Reagan Plan for Mideast Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., after meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, says he prefers ``direct
negotiations'' between Israel and its Arab neighbors rather than
the Reagan administration's plan for an international Middle East
peace conference.
   ``I think there are questions that have been given short shrift
that deserve a more careful study,'' the Tennessee Democrat told
reporters after meeting with Shamir here Sunday. ``What would the
role of the Soviet Union be in the conference?''
   Shamir maintained his opposition to an international peace
conference in meetings with President Reagan last week, saying a
Soviet presence in the talks would bring more pressure on Israel to
give up land captured from the Arabs during the 1967 Middle East
War.
   Gore spent Sunday here campaigning for support in New York's
April 19 presidential primary. He addressed about 1,200 people at
the annual dinner of the Council of Jewish Organizations of Borough
Park, an umbrella organization for 190 groups in a neighborhood
that is home to 100,000 Hasidic Jews.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Attack 6 Outposts Of Israeli-Backed Militia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas attacked six positions manned by
an Israeli-backed militia before dawn today in one of their biggest
assaults this year, security sources reported.
   There was no immediate report of casualties and it could not be
determined which guerrilla faction launched the assault on the
South Lebanon Army outposts, the second reported clash in three
days.
   After today's attack, Israeli and South Lebanon Army gunners
shelled the Shiite Moslem market town of Nabatiyeh with mortars and
tank cannon in an apparent retaliation for the pre-dawn raid,
police said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
guerrillas fired machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades into
the South Lebanon Army positions in the central sector of Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' on the Lebanon-Israel border.
   The mainly Christian South Lebanon Army retaliated with heavy
machine guns and mortars, the sources reported.
   Israeli troops rushed to reinforce the army positions and opened
up on the raiders with tank fire, the sources said. The fighting
lasted for two hours until the attackers withdrew, the sources said.
   Several positions manned by Irish and Finnish troops of the
United Nations peacekeeping force were caught in the crossfire, but
no U.N. soldiers were hurt, the sources added.
   The zone policed by the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon overlaps
the Israeli-occupied buffer zone carved out in June 1985 when
Israel withdrew the bulk of its army three years after its invaded
Lebanon.
   In the attack by Israeli and South Lebanon Army on the Moslem
town, two women were wounded when five shells exploded in the Sarai
quarter, crowded with villagers in town for the weekly market day,
police said.
   The 30-minute barrage brought the town of 150,000 inhabitants to
a standstill. Shopkeepers lowered their shutters, businesses closed
and schools sent pupils home.
   Today's hostilities came two days after tank-led Israeli troops
and South Lebanon Army militiamen raided suspected guerrilla bases
four miles northeast of the security zone.
   Shiite Moslem guerrillas earlier fought a seven-hour shelling
duel with the Israelis and their militia allies in which two
elderly Lebanese civilians were wounded.
   Israeli fighter-bombers raided a Palestinian guerrilla camp in
the Chouf Mountains southeast of Beirut last Thursday, killing one
guerrilla in their deepest penetration into Lebanon this year.

   Negotiations to reunite South Korea's
bitterly divided opposition collapsed again today with both sides
refusing to compromise over sharing power and party posts.
   The Reunification Democratic Party announced it had pulled out
of talks with the smaller Party for Peace and Democracy and said
there was no hope of uniting the two parties. It denounced Party
for Peace and Democracy supporters for staging a violent protest
that broke up talks.
   ``The party concluded it would be meaningless and impossbile to
continue merger talks because the positions between the parties are
so wide apart,'' said a Reunification Democratic Party spokesman,
Kim Pae-ryong.
   Party for Peace and Democracy leaders said they wanted to
continue unification talks, but they recognized negotiations had
stalled. They charged the Reunification Democratic Party wanted to
destroy rival opposition groups.
   The two parties said there was no chance of reuniting before
National Assembly elections next month. Both groups said they would
mount separate election campaigns even though it would boost the
government's chances of a major victory.
   The acting Party for Peace and Democracy president, Park
Young-sook, said the party hoped that unification talks could be
revived after the election if not sooner. ``We need a strong
leadership and a strong opposition,'' she said.
   About a dozen students staged protests at the two party
headquarters today to demand the talks resume and wrote protests
with blood after cutting their fingers.
   Some opposition leaders and lawmakers had been pushing for
reunification of the two parties to avoid a major defeat in the
National Assembly elections expected to be held April 26.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung and his supporters split away
from the Reunification Democratic Party to form the Party for Peace
and Democracy late last year after he and the larger party's
president, Kim Young-sam, failed to agree on which one of them
should run for president.
   Both Kims ran in the Dec. 16 election and were defeated by
government candidate President Roh Tae-woo after splitting the
opposition vote.
   Roh took office Feb. 25.

   A standoff between Nashville police and a man who said he
accidentally killed his girlfriend ended early today when the

wounded himself after killing a man and holding police at bay,

   George E. Powell, 45, of Nashville died at 1:35 a.m. of a
shotgun wound to the head at Vanderbilt University Medical Center,
officials said.
   Powell called police at 6:45 p.m. Sunday and told them he had
accidentally shot his girlfriend, Caroline Campbell of Nashville,
during a scuffle, said Buddy Mitchell, a hostage negotiator for the
police.
   ``He says they both had been drinking and had a sawed-off
shotgun,'' Mitchell said. ``He says they got into an argument over
the gun and it went off and shot her. He dragged her into the
bedroom and covered her up with a blanket and set the telephone on
top.''
   Powell, a sheet metal worker, told police he planned to kill
himself, Mitchell said. Police said they talked on the phone with
Powell throughout the ordeal.
   At least 10 patrol cars and the SWAT team communications van
were dispatched to the scene, and police sealed off the area.
   At 12:45 a.m., Powell said goodbye to the negotiators on the
phone, hung up and shot himself in the head, police said.
   In Huntsville, Ala., a 40-year-old man was listed in critical
condition after an eight-hour standoff that began with the gunshot
slaying of an acquaintance of the man's ex-wife and ended when the
man apparently shot himself, authorities said.
   Madison County Sheriff Joe Patterson said Jerry Staggs
apparently attempted suicide about 7 p.m. Sunday after he released
his ex-wife, Sherry, 29, and the couple's two boys, whom he had
taken hostage before noon.
   Staggs was taken by helicopter to Huntsville Hospital, where he
was being treated for a gunshot wound to the head, said spokeswoman
June Hackworth.
   The apparent suicide attempt ended a tense standoff that began
when Staggs shot the acquaintance of his ex-wife as the man sat in
his car outside Staggs' trailer, police said. About 25 police
officers surrounded the trailer and evacuated residents of the
dozen other mobile homes in the trailer park north of Huntsville.
   The Huntsville News reported today the victim was identified as
Don Pressnell, a former Athens police officer.
   Patterson said Staggs had been arrested two weeks ago on a
kidnapping charge and there had been an attempt to obtain
psychiatric treatment for him.
   The standoff ended when a shot rang out and Mrs. Staggs ran out
the door of the trailer. She told police her ex-husband had shot
himself in the head, said Capt. Robert Moder of the Huntsville
Police Department.
   Butler said Staggs was employed by the city maintenance
department.

<HEAD>Palestinian Fatally Shot; General Strike In Occupied Territories</HEAD>

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian
in the Gaza Strip today, Arab reports said, and Palestinians staged
a widespread general strike in the occupied territories.
   The strike, which left shops shuttered and public transport
idle, came in response to a PLO call for ``the most severe
confrontation'' to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a
Palestinian guerrilla clash with Israel.
   Also today, attackers fired at a moderate Arab's home, the army
bulldozed homes of suspected firebombers and a leaflet by Arab
underground leaders urged more Arabs working for the Israeli
government to quit by Saturday.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned Sunday night the army may
use tougher measures against Palestinians after the shooting death
of an Israeli soldier, the first member of the military to be
killed in four months of rioting.
   In the Gaza town of Rafah, soldiers today fired tear gas and
ammunition at stone-throwing protesters. Abdel Ahmed Jaber al
Mudalal, 17, of Rafah, died after he was shot in the chest,
according to Arab reports and the Palestine Press Service.
   Al Mudalal's body was taken to Khan Yunis' Nasser Hospital, the
reports said. The army said it was checking the report. If
confirmed, the fatality would bring to 104 the number of
Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8, including four
tear gas deaths, according to U.N. figures.
   Rabin told reporters the army was investigating whether the
shooting death of Sgt. Moshe Katz indicated Palestinians intended
to expand the scope of their protests to firearms from the usual
stones and gasoline bombs.
   Katz, a reserve soldier, died Sunday in Bethlehem after he was
shot in the head at close range while on guard duty at a government
building.
   If ``extremist Palestinian terrorist elements try to combine
terrorist acts with civilian protests, we will have to change our
operations and take harsher measures to handle both,'' Rabin said.
   Attackers fired shots before dawn today at the home and car of
Jack Khazmo, a prominent moderate Palestinian newspaper editor,
workers at the weekly Al Bayader Assiyasi said. No injuries were
reported.
   Wajiha Awadallah, Khazmo's secretary, said attackers ``fired
many shots'' into Khazmo's house in the village of Ram, just north
of Jerusalem, at about 2:45 a.m.
   She said they also ``tried to burn the car, but it was windy and
rainy,'' and the effort failed. She said she did not know who
attacked the editor, whose newspaper follows a mainstream
nationalist Palestinian line.
   The domestic news agency Itim reported the army demolished nine
Arab houses during the night _ three because they belonged to
people suspected of firebomb attacks. The agency said it was the
first time the army demolished homes of suspected firebombers. New
rules for soldiers also allow them to shoot when attacked with
firebombs.
   Arab reporters said underground leaders of what Palestinians
call ``the uprising'' distributed a new leaflet, No. 11, calling
for Arabs belonging to or working for Israeli-appointed municipal
councils in the West Bank and Gaza to quit by Saturday.
   Hundreds of Arab policemen resigned last week at the request of
Palestinian underground leaders, who are members of the PLO.
   Time and Newsweek magazines filed an injunction with the Supreme
Court today in an effort to recover news film Israeli authorities
confiscated after the shooting of Katz. ``Demands for the return of
the film made repeatedly to Israeli authorities has been
unavailing, and as a result legal action is being pursued,'' the
magazines said in a statement.
   Israeli Arabs on Sunday decided to hold a general strike on
March 30 to mark Land Day, an annual national event which began a
decade ago as a protest against the government's policy of
expropriating Arab-owned land.

<TEXT>
   FBI agents acting on an anonymous tip peacefully
captured one of the agency's 10 most wanted fugitives, a killer
sought in three kidnappings since his escape from a Louisiana
prison 19 months ago, authorities said.
   Danny Michael Weeks, 34, and a companion, Jorene H. Florea, 56,
were arrested Sunday by a 10-member FBI team, said Don S. Tokunaga,
who heads the agency's Seattle office.
   The two apparently were just passing through when agents
received an anonymous tip from someone who had recognized Weeks as
on the most-wanted list, Tokunaga said.
   ``It was one of those spur-of-the-moment things,'' he said. ``We
were fortunate there were no incidents.''
   The two were scheduled to appear before a U.S. magistrate today.
   Weeks was wanted for escape, interstate flight, and on warrants
alleging kidnapping in Houston and kidnapping and robbery in
Greensboro, N.C. He also has been implicated in a kidnapping in
Alexandria, La., the day after his Aug. 24, 1986, escape from the
Louisiana State Penitentiary.
   Ms. Florea was wanted by officials in Greensboro on a warrant
charging her with kidnapping.
   When arrested, the pair were unarmed and were looking into the
trunk of a car.
   Weeks, originally of Roswell, N.M., was serving a life sentence
for armed robbery and murder when he and James Lee Colvin, 33, of
Shreveport, La., escaped from the prison.
   The next day, authorities said, Colvin and Weeks kidnapped a
woman at knifepoint in Alexandria and forced her to drive to
Houston, where she was freed unharmed.
   Later that day, authorities said, the two forced another woman
at gunpoint into her car in Houston. She was forced to drive them
to El Paso, Texas, but was unharmed.
   Colvin, who was captured in 1986 in Los Angeles, was convicted
in August in Houston of federal kidnapping charges.
   Tokunaga said the Greensboro warrants stemmed from the Feb. 23,
1988, kidnapping at gunpoint of Guilford County, N.C., sheriff's
Deputy Susan Kathleen Vincent, 27. She was released unharmed in
Chicago on Feb. 26.
   Ms. Vincent said that during her abduction, her captors robbed a
bank in Davenport, Iowa.
   Greensboro police said they were seeking the extradition of
Weeks and Ms. Florea in Ms. Vincent's abduction.
   Weeks was serving a 99-year sentence for armed robbery when he
was sentenced in 1985 to life in prison for the Christmas 1981
contract slaying of Army Sgt. Major Hubert Ester. Weeks pleaded
guilty to second-degree murder.
   Ester's wife, Patricia, was convicted of first-degree murder in
1983 for hiring Weeks and is serving a life sentence.
   Weeks escaped twice from authorities in Ouachita Parish, La. He
committed the armed robbery in Shreveport after his first escape.

<HEAD>Psychological Tests Don't Accurately Measure Black Personality,
Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the psychological tests now in use do a
poor job of evaluating black personality and attitudes, according
to a black psychologist who says he has developed a test to remedy
the problem.
   ``It is time we begin to show sensitivity to black American
culture and stop trying to make black Americans conform to Anglo
test material and test biases,'' said Robert L. Williams, a
professor of psychology and black studies at Washington University
in St. Louis.
   Williams made the comments Saturday to about 150 people at a
psychology conference, where participants studied the impact of
ethnicity and race on their clients.
   ``Black lifestyles should be examined and understood in terms of
their historical, cultural and social realities and not in terms of
a comparison with the experiences of other groups, for example
Euro-Americans,'' said Williams.
   He said he has developed a standardized test for blacks called
Themes Concerning Blacks.
   The test, now being used by a number of schools, corporations
and psychologists, consists of 20 charcoal drawings depicting
various aspects of black culture and lifestyles in rural and urban
areas, he said.
   Culturally specific tests are necessary because people of
various ethnic backgrounds may perform badly on tests designed for
and by Euro-Americans, and they may be labeled inaccurately as a
result, Williams said.
   ``Mislabeling may have profoundly negative effects on
intellectual and personality development,'' Williams said.
   He said he was told by a white counselor in elementary school
that he had only borderline intelligence and should take manual
training programs in high school. Williams later went to college
and earned a doctorate from Washington University.
   The conference, which ended Saturday, was sponsored by the
Chicago School of Professional Psychology.

   A Delta Air Lines jet made a safe
emergency landing after one of its sets of wheels failed to lower.
The jet's left wing scraped the runway and ignited but no injuries
were reported.
   Flight 314 circled Portland International Airport for 40 minutes
Sunday after the Boeing 727-200's left landing gear failed to
operate.
   The pilot, 20-year Delta veteran Tom Peace, gently set the plane
on its right and front wheels as it rolled 2,000 to 3,000 feet on a
rarely used runway, said Darrel Buttice of the Port of Portland.
   Port spokeswoman Sara Roberts said emergency crews immediately
put out the small fire on the left wing.
   Inflatable emergency chutes were deployed from the doorways, and
the 71 passengers were evacuated without incident, Ms. Roberts said.
   The incident was under investigation by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The flight originated in Atlanta and made a stop in Salt Lake
City before heading to Portland, Buttice said.

   Models in glen plaid cutaways or sequined jackets
over black pants looked like emcees from the Folies Bergeres as
Italian Enrico Coveri threw a winter wear floor show to celebrate
his 10th year as a Paris designer.
   As for the skinny sequin dresses with hearts or fringes on
bosoms and the crinoline short puffy dresses, they more often
looked like Toulouse-Lautrec's dancers.
   His longer dance-hall dresses with striped taffeta skirts, moire
jackets and bodices laced up with velvet were more wearable.
   Coveri's show Sunday featured day looks with military details.
Reversible short capes in all colors, plaids and houndstooth checks
flew open over well-cut suits, either with short, full skirts or
pants with gold-buttoned military jackets _ sergeant's stripe
details stitched into the sleeves.
   Long pants or minis had the zebra touch, sometimes paired with
leather.
   Angelo Tarlazzi had a ``spaghetti Western'' show with some
strong ideas for day clothes.
   Boots and cowboy hats were worn with almost everything,
including the full-skirted belted coats _ black for daytime,
taffeta for evening.
   Some of the long and swirly-skirted coats in dusty pinks came
out with brown beaver collars and full beaver sleeves. Some of his
greatcoats were worn with gray or navy battle jackets and flounced
grey flannel skirts underneath.
   Another suit had a tailored jacket front and puffy sleeves over
slim velvet or tweed pants. Tarlazzi often topped pants with long
split or wrapped pleated skirts.
   Minis appeared in low-waisted royal blue and black or red
jersey, sometimes topped with wrapped shawls _ long a Tarlazzi
trademark.
   His new soft sweaters either had yoked fronts and black ribbons
wound through their hems or ``passementerie'' or tasseled
curtain-edging in bi-colored outfits.
   For evening, it was Western saloon garb, with puffy taffeta
skirts hitched up over boots, fitted fake fur tops with pointed
hems, tiered and ruffled skirts with short tuxedo tops _ over pants.
   Issey Miyake, the artistic Japanese with a flair for fabrics,
has loosened up his complicated looks to smoother styles for easy
wear.
   His triple-layered flowing jersey tent dresses in soft sky or
royal or grape blues, plum, gray and black left the body totally
unconstricted.
   Menswear styles looked pleasingly shaped or baggy. But feminine
notes abounded as well, especially in a short sheer crepe caramel
dress pleated all over.
   Miyake finished up with some trouser suits splattered with color.
   At Balenciaga, designer Michel Goma showed simple sophistication
in belted coats with pilgrims' or caped collars, suits with cropped
weskit jackets and full-skirted tweed suits with full lacy
petticoats showing underneath.
   At Dorothee Bis, the unpretentious styles were easy, young and
offhand, always colorful, with fuchsias, blues and bright greens.
   Her all-knit starters were slim polo-necked and short, coming
out in 14 colors with matching tights. To pep up some of the
dresses, she plastered them with triangles flapping from one point.
   Shorts suits and babydoll dresses with yokes put in a cheery
appearance. And evenings had glitter dusted on black or cocktail
suits with guipure or heavy lace backs and sleeves on blazers over
guipure skirts.

<TEXT>
   Members of the Florida Baptist
General Convention are in an ``uproar'' over the drug arrest of
their executive director.
   The Rev. John Taylor, 25, was one of 139 people arrested last
week in Operation Crackdown III by the Broward Sheriff's
Department, deputies said. He was charged with trying to buy crack
from an undercover officer, police said.
   Dr. Henry J. Lyons, a minister and president of the St.
Petersburg-based group, said Taylor has been suspended without pay.
That leaves vacant the convention's top administrative post two
weeks before the 500,000-member organization convenes its annual
meeting.
   Taylor's future will be discussed at that gathering, Lyons said.
   ``Everyone is in an uproar and an outrage. They don't know what
to think,'' Lyons said. ``We will offer him some sort of
rehabilitative help if he wants it or deems it necessary.''
   ``If proven guilty, we will have no alternative but to terminate
him from his office,'' Lyons said. The convention is an association
of 728 Baptist churches that considers itself the single largest
black organization in the state.
   Lyons said Taylor, who lives in St. Petersburg, was in Fort
Lauderdale on official convention business. He was arrested
northwest of Fort Lauderdale several hours after he attended a
service Thursday at Mount Olive Baptist Church.
   Lyons said he sent two ministers to Fort Lauderdale on Friday to
learn the facts of the case.
   The convention hired Taylor 16 months ago, recruiting him from
Bishop College in Dallas, where he was doing graduate work.
   ``He handles the nuts and bolts. He carries the program of the
convention across the state,'' Lyons said. ``He does his job
extremely well. We were quite satisfied with his job performance. I
have no reason to think he was using cocaine. It never dawned on
me.''
   A Broward County Jail employee said Taylor was no longer in
custody Saturday.

   An unarmed intruder was shot to death
while scaling a gate outside Parliament, police said today.
   Police spokesman Ravi Pawar said the unidentified man was
challenged by security guards shortly after midnight Sunday. When
the man did not heed their calls, the guards opened fire, Pawar
said.
   A senior police officer investigating the case said the intruder
was not armed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Security is tight at Parliament because it is currently in
session and Sikh militants agitating for a separate homeland have
threatened to kill Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and members of his
Cabinet.
   The officer said a police team was sent to neighboring Haryana
state to an address in a diary found near the intruder's body.
   ``Until the team returns, we cannot identify the man,'' he said.

<HEAD>`M. Butterfly' a Fascinating Play of Layers, Reversals</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS three grafs at end with other critics</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``M. Butterfly,'' which opened Sunday night, is
a brilliant new play, with layers of ironies, fantasies, sexual and
romantic ambiguities and gender reversals by individuals and even
the Occident and the Orient.
   The play, California-born playwright David Henry Hwang's
Broadway debut, stars John Lithgow and B.D. Wong, both giving
striking performances.
   The story turns on its head Puccini's opera ``Madame
Butterfly,'' in which Navy Lt. Pinkerton marries Madame Butterfly
while stationed in Japan then sails away while she lovingly
believes he'll come back.
   In ``M. Butterfly'' _ meaning Monsieur Butterfly _ it is the
foreign man posted in the Orient who deeply loves. Lithgow plays
Rene Gallimard, attached to the French embassy in Beijing in 1960.
   The naive, babyfaced Gallimard, who narrates the story in
flashback from a French prison, sees the woman of his dreams, Song
Liling (B.D. Wong), singing ``Madama Butterfly.'' He calls the
singer Butterfly ever after.
   But Butterfly is a Chinese actor playing a woman, and whether
Butterfly cares for Gallimard is unknown. They have an affair for
20 years in which Gallimard never sees Butterfly naked or allows
himself to realize Butterfly is a man.
   Hwang, whose plays have been acclaimed off-Broadway, was
inspired by real-life reports of a similar situation in an
espionage trial in France.
   In ``M. Butterfly,'' Butterfly is a Communist agent who gives
Gallimard misinformation to pass on to America about Vietnam.
Eventually Butterfly gets him to become a courier and photograph
documents.
   At Gallimard's treason trial, Butterfly, in a business suit,
tells the judge, ``The West has a racial mentality about the East.
The West thinks of itself as masculine, the East as delicate,
wanting to be submissive.''
   The play is talky, as plays of ideas are. But Lithgow's
character, as written and acted, is a rich one. Gallimard had a
wife (Rose Gregorio) and a fling with a young blonde (Lindsay
Frost) whose frank speech he considered masculine. Butterfly, asked
by the judge (George N. Martin) how Gallimard could not know he was
a man, says: ``Men believe what they want to believe.''
   The play is ambiguous about whether Gallimard wanted to believe
in his dream woman or whether he was, without knowing his own
secret, homosexual. The two argue about that _ for too long _ after
the trial, Gallimard insisting, ``I am a man who loved a woman
created by a man.''
   The play ends like the opera, with Gallimard having taken over
Butterfly's situation and finally her role.
   Director John Dexter has seamlessly woven Eastern and Western
stage elements. Stagehands wearing black, so they're ``unseen,'' as
in Oriental theater, move furniture and props. The stage has a red
backdrop and a black platform encircled by a sweeping white ramp
that reaches high into the wings.
   In other reviews, the Daily News' Howard Kissel said the play is
witty and filled with provocative images, but baffling.
``Off-Broadway, its assets would be properly appreciated,'' the
review said. ``Here its slick trappings set expectations it cannot
meet.''
   Reviewer Frank Rich of The New York Times said the ``singular''
play treats a number of universal conflicts _ men versus women and
East versus West.
   ``Though `M. Butterfly' presents us with a visionary work that
bridges the history and culture of two worlds, the production stops
crushingly short of finding the gripping human drama that merges
Mr. Hwang's story with his brilliant play of ideas,'' the critic
wrote.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Richard Celeste wants Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci to reconsider holding National Guard
training exercises in Honduras because of recent reports of
hostilities with neighboring Nicaragua.
   In a letter to Carlucci on Saturday, Celeste said he was
concerned for the safety of Ohio guardsmen after President Reagan
ordered ``combat ready'' members of the 82nd Airborne into the
Central American nation.
   Reagan sent the troops last week after Nicaraguan troops
reportedly crossed into Honduras in pursuit of Contra rebel forces
battling Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   ``I urge you to defer this and all National Guard training
missions at least until the current highly charged situation is
behind us,'' Celeste said in the letter. ``If not, what assurance
can you provide that this is a neccessary and prudent training
mission for our Guard members at this time?''
   The governor also wrote that he believed the presence of U.S.
National Guard units in Honduras could undermine progress on
Central American peace negotiatons.
   Celeste wrote that he continued to oppose sending Ohio
engineering units into Honduras for exercises scheduled for 1989,
but pledged to abide by instructions of the Defense Department and
the National Guard Bureau.
   Ohio and several other states joined Minnesota in a lawsuit
challenging the Guard Bureau's authority to commit state guardsmen
to training exercises outside the country over a governor's
objection. A federal court in Minnesota last summer ruled in favor
of the Guard Bureau, but the decision is being appealed.
   The governor's press secretary, Debra Phillips, said the letter
was sent Saturday by an overnight delivery service to Carlucci ``so
it will be on his desk when he gets in Monday morning.''
   Copies of the letter also were sent to Ohio's U.S. Senators _
John Glenn and Howard Metzenbaum _ and to U.S. Rep. Edward Feighan,
all Democrats.

   The recent death of child star
Heather O'Rourke has left MGM studio executives in a quandary over
how to market her film ``Poltergeist III'' without appearing to
exploit the 12-year-old actress.
   ``Normal adults and obviously fathers like myself might be very
offended,'' said Barry Lorie, MGM's senior vice president for
marketing.
   Miss O'Rourke died Feb. 1 of septic shock caused by a bowel
obstruction. She had completed the film, scheduled for release June
10, last spring.
   She was best known for her lines ``They're heeeeere'' and
``They're baaaaack,'' which helped sell the first two
``Poltergeist'' films.
   In ``Poltergeist III'' Miss O'Rourke's character, Carol Anne,
still haunted by ghostly beings, is sent to live with relatives in
Chicago.
   Although Lorie said the films generally appeal to teen-age
audiences whose members likely wouldn't be disturbed by Miss
O'Rourke's death, he added he could imagine angry letters from
adults denouncing an ad campaign that appears to trade on her death.
   The studio plans to test audience reactions to various ad
campaigns shown at screenings before releasing the film June 10.
   Lorie said MGM has also asked the movie's other main stars, Tom
Skerritt and Nancy Allen, to avoid interviews that would lead to
questions about Miss O'Rourke.
   Lorie said the studio is worried about tabloid exploitation,
particularly because one actor on each of the previous movies died
shortly after shooting was completed.
   Actress Dominique Dunne, who appeared in the original 1982 film,
was strangled by an ex-boyfriend in 1982. Julian Beck, of
``Poltergeist II'' died of cancer in 1985.

<HEAD>Woman Injured, Seven Beefalo Die After Herd Ambles Onto Highway</HEAD>

   Horse thieves cut a hole in a fence and allowed at
least 75 beefalo to wander onto the Florida Turnpike, leading to
five minor accidents, an injury to a woman and the deaths of seven
animals, police said.
   Five of the beefalo died in the accidents and two other injured
animals had to be killed by Humane Society workers, the Florida
Highway Patrol reported.
   The beefalo, part of a 400-head herd owned by Dr. Arnie Oper,
roamed through a hole cut by thieves and ambled onto the turnpike
extension north of Miami Sunday morning, said FHP Sgt. Alvis Chinn.
   ``What they're doing apparently is stealing the horses in the
early morning hours and they're leaving without fixing the fence,''
Chinn said.
   The accidents caused an estimated $18,000 to $20,000 in damage
to the vehicles involved, Chinn said. An unidentified woman who was
treated for minor injuries and released from Palmetto General
Hospital, he said.
   Motorist Shelley D'Errico said she slowed down when she spotted
part of the herd. When one started toward her car, she took off.
   ``My husband told me to gun it,'' she said, adding that her car
was unscathed. ``I don't know if my insurance company would believe
that a buffalo put a dent in my car.''
   The herd was rounded up by animal-control officers, passersby
and ranch workers, Chinn said. The beefalo, a hybrid of buffalo and
cattle, were valued at $1,500 to $1,800 each.

<HEAD>Woman Set Afire Because Of Drug Debt, Police Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who owed a $50 cocaine debt was
beaten and locked in a car trunk, then doused with gasoline and set
afire by angry drug dealers, police said.
   The 36-year-old woman, who officers refused to identify, was
taken to Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley with second- and
third-degree burns on 15 percent of her upper body, police said. A
nursing supervisor who asked not to be identified said the woman
was in stable condition.
   ``This is my first time to find something like this in a coke
deal,'' said police Sgt. Roy Williams.
   Authorities said witnesses told investigators a group of men
confronted the woman Friday seeking payment of the drug debt.
   They said that when she said she couldn't pay, she was beaten,
thrown into the trunk of their car and driven away, then was
returned and set afire.
   Residents of one North Oakland neighborhood held a rally
Saturday to urge a battle against drug dealers.
   ``After years of slavery, job discrimination, the Depression,
Northern intimidation, lynchings and beatings, none of which broke
the spirit of the black race, a little white powder has come along
that has done more damage to the black community than any span of
history,'' the Rev. Ray Williams told listeners.
   Many homes in the area had boarded up windows and barred doors.
   ``What's happened to the neighborhood?'' asked Estelle Harmon, a
resident for 28 years. ``Name it. Everything. It used to be nice
and neat and clean, and now all of these dope people have gotten in
here, and I mean we are surrounded.''

<TEXT>
   Commuter buses from Soweto
were deserted today and four buses near Durban were firebombed as
hundreds of thousands of blacks joined the first nationwide protest
strike since major opposition groups were banned last month.
   In other violence, police fired tear gas at a predominantly
Indian university and arrested students who tried to force others
to join the boycott. The strike was organized in defiance of
emergency regulations to commemorate the 28th anniversary of a
massacre in the township of Sharpeville and to protest the banning
of any activity by the United Democratic Front and 16 other
anti-apartheid groups.
   Police estimated 40 percent of the black work force in the
Johannesburg region stayed away from their jobs, but did not give a
figure for the number involved.
   In Sharpeville, residents placed flowers at graves of some of
the 69 massacre victims and held memorial services.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, attended one of the services after arriving in the
township south of Johannesburg in a bus with other activists.
   There was an unconfirmed report police ordered the bus to leave,
but Mrs. Mandela said her group left voluntarily.
   In Soweto, the black township of 2.5 million people outside
Johannesburg, virtually no passengers boarded commuter buses,
according to Cheryl Roxmouth of the Putco bus company. Normal daily
ridership is about 75,000.
   Schools and most shops in Soweto were closed, and residents said
few of the hundreds of mini-bus taxis which carry many Sowetans to
work were operating.
   South African Transport Services said ridership on its trains
during morning rush hour was down by up to 20 percent. It dismissed
as inaccurate an earlier press report that said ridership was down
by about 80 percent.
   In Durban, four Putco buses were firebombed, prompting Putco to
halt service in several townships when drivers refused to work.
Police reported two unrest-related killings of blacks overnight,
one near Durban and one in Soweto, but gave no indication if they
were linked to the protest.
   At the University of Durban-Westville, where most students are
of Indian descent, police used tear gas to disperse protesters and
arrested some students who tried to force others to boycott
classes. Some students attending class were beaten by supporters of
the boycott.
   The strike was widespread in the Johannesburg-Pretoria area, in
Durban and around the eastern Cape Province city of Port Elizabeth.
More than 90 percent of black workers reportedly stayed home around
the city of Uitenhage, where police killed 21 blacks during a
funeral procession on Sharpeville Day in 1985.
   There was no explicit call for workers in the Cape Town area to
strike.
   The United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, had coordinated previous nationwide
protests during the 21-month-old state of emergency. Emergency
regulations outlaw calls for strikes and boycotts, but hundreds of
thousands of black workers and students nonetheless observed these
protests by staying away from jobs and schools.
   Several affiliates of the front, not affected by the new ban,
took out newspaper advertisements announcing today's ``national day
of protest.''
   Police commanders threatened action against organizers of the
strike and issued assurances that blacks wishing to work would be
protected from intimidators. There were reports of black youths
turning back commuters but no reports of physical intimidation.
   Commemorative services were scheduled in several cities and
townships to mark the anniversary of the 1960 massacre in
Sharpeville. Sixty-nine blacks were killed and about 180 injured
when police fired on thousands of demonstrators protesting the pass
laws. Those laws, which restricted blacks' freedom of movement,
were repealed in 1986.
   The predominantly white University of Cape Town and the mostly
mixed-race University of the Western Cape closed in solidarity with
the protest. For similar reasons, today's performance of ``District
Six,'' a musical with an anti-apartheid theme playing to full
houses in Johannesburg, was canceled.
   An afternoon protest was planned at Johannesburg's University of
the Witwatersrand, where the president of the student council,
Rosemary Hunter, reportedly was detained by police early today.
   Sharpeville returned to the spotlight last week when it became
known that Friday had been set as the execution date for the
``Sharpeville Six'' _ five black men and a woman convicted of
complicity in the mob killing of a black town councilor during
anti-apartheid riots in 1984.
   Appeals for clemency poured in from around the world, but
President P.W. Botha said he would not intervene to save the six.
   On Thursday, 15 hours before the hangings were to take place, a
Supreme Court judge granted a one-month stay of execution in order
to consider defense attorneys' claims that a key state witness has
perjured himself.

<HEAD>Police Want To Question Oscar-Nominated Writer About Huge Book
Find</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police looking for overdue books
with fines totaling about $3,000 found more than 10,000 books from
libraries worldwide in lockers rented by the Oscar-nominated author
whose book became the movie ``Full Metal Jacket.''
   Police want to question Jerry Gustav Hasford, author of ``The
Short-Timers,'' said campus police detective Ray Berrett of
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
   A search warrant served by police from the school sought 87
overdue books that had been checked out from the campus library in
Hasford's name. Fines totaled about $3,000.
   ``We found a lot more than we bargained for,'' said Wayne
Carmack, another investigator.
   Officers found only seven campus library books, but seized
thousands of books marked as belonging to libraries as far away as
England and Australia, Carmack said.
   University police have been unable to find Hasford and question
him about the books, but have not sought an arrest warrant from the
district attorney's office, Berrett said Saturday.
   Officers took a weekend break from the mammoth job of cataloging
the pile of books, which measures 27 feet long, 5 feet wide and 5
feet tall, police dispatcher Suzi Goodwin said Sunday.
   Hasford, who recently lived in nearby Morro Bay, doesn't attend
the university but got a library card under a program open to state
residents, Carmack said. But the card was obtained with a false
address and Social Security number, Carmack said.
   There was no comment from Hasford; he does not have a listed
telephone number in San Luis Obispo.
   Hasford shares a 1988 Academy Award nomination for best
screenplay adaptation with ``Full Metal Jacket'' director Stanley
Kubrick and Michael Herr.
   He didn't appear Friday night at the Writers Guild of America
Awards ceremony, where he was considered for a similar award but
didn't win.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian
in the Gaza Strip today, Arab reports said, and Palestinians
carried out a widespread general strike in the occupied territories.
   The strike, which left shops shuttered and public transport
idle, came in response to a PLO call for ``the most severe
confrontation'' to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a
Palestinian guerrilla clash with Israel.
   Also today, attackers fired at a moderate Arab's home, the army
bulldozed homes of suspected firebombers and a leaflet by Arab
underground leaders urged more Arabs working for the Israeli
government to quit by Saturday.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned Sunday night the army may
use tougher measures against Palestinians after the shooting death
of an Israeli soldier, the first member of the military to be
killed in four months of rioting.
   In the Gaza town of Rafah, soldiers today fired tear gas and
ammunition at stone-throwing protesters. Abdel Ahmed Jaber al
Mudalal, 17, of Rafah, died after he was shot in the chest,
according to the Palestine Press Service and other Arab reports.
   Al Mudalal's body was taken to Khan Yunis' Nasser Hospital, the
reports said. The army confirmed the death, but said it could not
establish a cause because the youth's family had taken the body
from the hospital.
   U.N. officials, meanwhile, confirmed Arab reports that two men
died Sunday from gunshot wounds suffered earlier.
   Khalid Mohammed Taher, 25, was shot March 16 during a protest in
Tulkarim. Mohammed Mahmoud Hamad, 25, was hit by gunfire March 4 in
the village of Silwad, near Ramallah.
   The fatalities brought to 106 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising begin Dec. 8, including four deaths from tear
gas inhalation, according to U.N. figures.
   Rabin told reporters the army was investigating whether the
shooting death of Sgt. Moshe Katz indicated Palestinians intended
to expand the scope of their protests to firearms from the usual
stones and gasoline bombs.
   Katz, a reserve soldier, died Sunday in Bethlehem after he was
shot in the head at close range while on guard duty at a government
building.
   If ``extremist Palestinian terrorist elements try to combine
terrorist acts with civilian protests, we will have to change our
operations and take harsher measures to handle both,'' Rabin said.
   Attackers fired shots before dawn today at the home and car of
Jack Khazmo, a prominent moderate Palestinian newspaper editor,
workers at the weekly Al Bayader Assiyasi said. No injuries were
reported.
   Wajiha Awadallah, Khazmo's secretary, said attackers ``fired
many shots'' into Khazmo's house in the village of Ram, just north
of Jerusalem, at about 2:45 a.m.
   She said they also ``tried to burn the car, but it was windy and
rainy,'' and the effort failed. She said she did not know who
attacked the editor, whose newspaper follows a mainstream
nationalist Palestinian line.
   The domestic news agency Itim reported the army demolished nine
Arab houses during the night _ three because they belonged to
people suspected of firebomb attacks. The agency said it was the
first time the army demolished homes of suspected firebombers. New
rules for soldiers also allow them to shoot when attacked with
firebombs.
   Arab reporters said underground leaders of what Palestinians
call ``the uprising'' distributed a new leaflet, No. 11, calling
for Arabs belonging to or working for Israeli-appointed municipal
councils in the West Bank and Gaza to quit by Saturday.
   Hundreds of Arab policemen resigned last week at the request of
Palestinian underground leaders, who are members of the PLO.
   Time and Newsweek magazines filed an injunction with the Supreme
Court today in an effort to recover news film Israeli authorities
confiscated after the shooting of Katz. ``Demands for the return of
the film made repeatedly to Israeli authorities has been
unavailing, and as a result legal action is being pursued,'' the
magazines said in a statement.
   Israeli Arabs on Sunday decided to hold a general strike on
March 30 to mark Land Day, an annual national event which began a
decade ago as a protest against the government's policy of
expropriating Arab-owned land.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT that Dole has won one primary, South
Dakota, since capturing GOP caucuses in Iowa.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaning back in his chair at a hotel suite as
he waited for his next campaign appearance, Sen. Bob Dole reflected
on his reasons for remaining in the race for the Republican
presidential nomination.
   While some have begun to speak of concerns about splitting the
GOP, Dole spoke Sunday about responsibility and confidence.
   ``It's about the best thing that could happen to the party,''
Dole said of his decision to stay in the race even though he has
won just one primary _ South Dakota _ since he captured the GOP
caucuses in Iowa.
   ``It's the responsible thing to do. We've had a dozen
Republicans either look at this or formerly run as candidates. Now
we're down to two and we can get down to business.''
   Although some have speculated that a loss in the Wisconsin
primary April 5 may force him out of the race, Dole said he thought
his campaign work was only starting.
   ``It's the first day of spring, and we still haven't debated the
issues,'' he said. ``We've had little press conferences that they
called debates. ... but now we have a real chance to debate George
Bush.''
   Dole had challenged Bush to a debate before the Illinois
primary, but Bush refused. Dole said he will try to arrange a
debate before the Wisconsin primary _ perhaps in Wisconsin itself.
   ``We'll talk about any subject. He'll pick two and I'll pick two
_ no notes, no moderator, just an hour or hour-and-a-half debate.''
   Dole kicked off a three-day campaign swing through Wisconsin
just hours after receiving news of a Milwaukee Journal poll that
showed him trailing Bush nearly 3-to-1 among Wisconsin voters
likely to vote in the primary.
   He said the poll was probably inaccurate but admitted ``I've got
a lot of hill to climb.''
   ``It's not surprising, but I don't think its accurate,'' he
said. ``It was taken right after Illinois with Super Tuesday still
hanging over my head. My view is that you give voters a couple of
weeks.''
   Dole was trounced by Bush on Super Tuesday and then lost again
in Illinois. He said Wisconsin was an important state for his
campaign, but a loss April 5 did not necessarily mean he would drop
out.
   ``We've been hearing the end is near, but people forget George
Bush stayed in eight weeks after he began losing to Ronald Reagan.
Eight weeks was enough for him to lose,'' he said in reference to
the 1980 GOP race. ``But I think eight weeks would be enough time
for me to turn some things around.''
   Although emphasizing confidence, Dole indicated that recent
attention to the cuts he made on his paid national staff wore on
his patience.
   He said he picked up a newspaper Sunday morning in Washington
and was pleased to see there was not a single story about politics.
   ``It was kind of refreshing to pick up the paper and read about
_ maybe not refreshing but different _ to read about Panama,
Honduras, Nicaragua and no politics.
   ``There are a lot of issues that should be discussed,'' he
added. ``We shouldn't be into this game about are you going to run
or are you going to drop out and how many staff people you have and
all that inside baseball. The voter can care less about that.''

<TEXT>
   A misunderstanding by officers resulted
in police breaking into the house of an elderly couple, where an
84-year-old man was killed in an exchange of gunfire, a prosecutor
says.
   The officers were supposed to knock on the door but thought
incorrectly that they were being ordered inside to capture a rape
suspect, District Attorney Andy Fuller said in an interview
published Sunday in The Times of Gainesville.
   Dillard Free was killed in the Christmas Eve shooting. Fuller
said Free apparently was awakened by the sound of his front door
being kicked down and fired two shots at officers.
   A grand jury on March 10 declined to indict the officer who shot
Free, but it expressed outrage about the shooting and called for a
review of police procedures.
   A Georgia Bureau of Investigation report on the shooting remains
sealed because of indictments against the two people who told
police the rape suspect was in the house. They are accused of
making false statements.
   Fuller said he decided to discuss the GBI's findings because
``the people of Hall County need to know this information.''
   Fuller said six law officers told the GBI they remembered police
Detective Robert Gable directing that they use normal procedure for
serving an arrest warrant _ that is, knocking and announcing
``warrant'' _ at the Free home.
   But the officers who took up positions in front of the house,
Lee West, Gary Lenderman and Kirk Williamson, were not present to
hear that order, Fuller said.
   He said that when Detective Russell Elrod told the officers by
radio to ``Go on in,'' Lenderman seemed surprised and asked, ``You
want us to go?''
   ``The evidence indicates the detectives did not mean for (West
and Williamson) to break the door down, but the evidence also
indicates that the uniformed officers felt they had been given a
directive to go into the house,'' Fuller said.
   West kicked down Free's front door and he and Williamson entered
the darkened living room while Sgt. Benny Patrick rushed onto the
front porch, Fuller said.
   He said Patrick saw a silhouette moving inside and shouted
``Police,'' but a shot was fired that narrowly missed his head. He
said West then also shouted ``Police'' and saw the figure fire
again, striking a door frame.
   West then fired two shots, fatally wounding Free in the thigh
and neck.
   Free's wife, Agnes, 73, was hospitalized for shock and died
March 5, three days after suffering a heart attack.
   The rape suspect the officers were seeking was arrested
Christmas Day in Texas.

   A motorcycle, apparently rigged with explosives,
blew up today near the Saudi Arabian Airlines office and a car bomb
exploded near the Israeli Embassy about 15 minutes later, police
said.
   There were no reports of injuries in the attacks. Police said
radicals may have been responsible.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
motorcycle, with apparent explosives on its back seat, burst into
flames at about 7:17 p.m. near Hibiya Park and shattered windows of
the Saudi Arabian Airlines Tokyo office. The park is about a
half-mile yards southeast of the Imperial Palace.
   The police official said the second attack occurred near the
Israel Embassy about 15 minutes later when explosives in a parked
car's trunk exploded, damaging windows of nearby houses.
   He said there were no reports of damage at the embassy, about 3{
miles from Hibiya Park.
   The official said Japanese radicals, who sometimes fire homemade
missiles from cars parked in streets, may have been responsible for
the explosions. Further details were not immediately available.
   Last month, four shuttle buses used to transport passengers to
and from airports were burned in Tokyo in apparent arson attacks by
radicals opposed to the expansion of the New Tokyo International
Airport in Narita.
   Local farmers and their supporters, including anti-government
radical groups, have been resisting government plans to expropriate
farmland to construct a second runway at Narita.
   In May 1986, Japanese radicals fired homemade missiles at the
state guest house, the U.S. Embassy, the Imperial Palace, the Crown
Prince's residence and police headquarters in Osaka before a
seven-nation summit meeeting in Tokyo.
   One attack came during Japan's welcoming ceremonies for the
heads of government of the United States, Canada, Britain, France,
West Germany and Italy.

<TEXT>
   A garbage truck driver who thought a
cat had climbed into his compactor was stunned to find a man nearly
buried under loads of trash.
   Driver Michael Penton said he had taken on two loads of garbage
when he got out of the truck to adjust the next garbage bin and
heard a noise.
   ``At first I thought it was kids playing,'' Penton said. ``But
then I realized there are no kids there; it's all retirees or
professional people.''
   Then he thought a cat was stuck inside.
   ``I just climbed up the ladder on the side of the truck, and
there was this guy buried in the trash,'' Penton said. ``All I saw
was this arm and head.''
   Pasco County emergency workers disentangled Dale Berube, who
suffered a broken pelvis and other injuries in the Thursday
accident.
   Berube said he had been trying to retrieve an old rug from the
garbage bin for a friend who wanted it to line a doghouse. He never
heard the garbage truck coming.
   Nor did he realize what was happening until he felt the truck
pick up the metal box, he said in a strained voice Saturday from
his bed at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg. He was tossed
into the truck and the compactor was started.
   ``I was very lucky,'' said Berube, who has been having
nightmares about his brush with death.
   ``I thought I was going to die for sure,'' he said. ``It was
like squishing my body apart. I saw it coming back the third time
and I thought, `Please, God, please.'''

<HEAD>Court Says Government Can Shut Black Paper During Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the country's most
militant anti-apartheid newspapers today lost a court appeal
seeking protection from government action, clearing the way for
authorities to shut it down for three months.
   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha had intended to close the
New Nation in January, but the paper's court challenge delayed the
move. His office would not comment today on how soon he would act.
   The paper was launched in January 1986 by the Southern African
Catholic Bishops Conference as an alternative newspaper to reflect
``the daily struggles, desires and aspirations of the masses.''
   Published weekly with a circulation of 50,000 to 60,000, it has
a small staff, and gets many of its reports from members of
community organizations, trade unions and youth groups in the rural
areas where the majority of black South Africans live.
   Its editor, Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been detained without charge
for 16 of the 26 months of publication. The government has said he
is being held because of his journalistic activities.
   Authorities have banned four of the paper's editions and seized
two. Police have raided the New Nation offices, and it was the
first of six publications to be warned by Botha that they could be
closed or censored for publishing material he found objectionable.
   The paper does not claim to be objective. It's philosophy was
explained in the last issue: ``Journalists should not only report
on what happens in society, but should also help find solutions to
the problems of our country.''
   But the paper challenged the government to prove in court that
any of its reports were illegal under the law or the emergency
regulations.
   The Johannesburg Supreme Court ruled last week that Botha has
nearly unlimited powers to deal as he pleases with papers he feels
might contribute to unrest. The court specifically ruled that Botha
did not have to give reasons for his decisions or actions.
   The court said the paper could appeal. But today, the court
turned down the paper's request to keep Botha from closing it
during the nine months the appeal will take to be heard.
   The decision left the way open for Botha to immediately issue a
decree closing the paper.
   Acting Editor Gabu Tugwana said after the court decision, ``We
are pretending we don't face any suspension. If the deadline (for
the Thursday) edition comes and we are printed, good luck to us.''
   He noted that government gazettes, in which emergency decrees
are published, usually come out on Friday ``except in special
circumstances. We don't know if we are that special to the
government. They don't contact us. They don't have to.''
   Botha's power allows him to close a paper for up to three
months, or establish an in-house censor, but Tugwana said that if
the paper is closed it would only be allowed to reopen under even
more stringent restrictions.
   ``I just think the world at large, internally and externally,
haven't yet seen this seriously. It is an action against the whole
media,'' he said.
   ``There are many more axes hanging in the air that will fall on
many others,'' he said in reference to warnings issued against
several other papers. ``We are the first on the line because we
have lesser protection. As far as the government is concerned, we
are just a pamphlet.''

<HEAD>Actors And Announcers For Commercials Go On Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Actors and announcers who make commercial
went on strike nationwide today after contract talks were
deadlocked over cable television residuals and cost-of-living
adjustments.
   ``The Screen Actors Guild and AFTRA did begin a strike at 12:01
this morning against advertising agencies and producers of
commercials,'' said Dick Moore, a spokesman for the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
   He said no new negotiations had been scheduled.
   The joint SAG-AFTRA membership numbers more than 100,000. The
unions negotiate together on the commercial contract.
   Talks on a new three-year pact between the performers and the
Joint Policy Committee of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers began Jan. 11
in New York City and hit an impasse March 7.
   Union negotiators received a 93 percent strike authorization
vote from members just before contract talks broke off.
   Meanwhile, no new talks were scheduled between the 9,000-member
Writers Guild of America and producers to end that union's
2-week-old strike. They have been at a stalemate over residuals
from foreign distribution, creative control and a management
proposal to restructure residuals for one-hour television shows
sold into syndication.
   The commercial contract dispute centers on performers' demands
for a share of money made from commercials broadcast on cable
television and advertisers' attempts to reduce union cost-of-living
adjustments.
   Actors currently receive no residuals from cable television
broadcasts of their commercials after they have earned their first
$1,000 in payments from regular, prime-time television. Virtually
all ads shown on cable meet the $1,000 requirement, said guild
official Ken Orsatti.
   The unions recently sent telegrams to all U.S. presidential
candidates offering to grant them production waivers if they agree
to interim contracts conceding to the demands.
   The interim contract offer was given to regular advertisers as
well, and as many as 40 have said they will seek them, according to
the union.

   Three teen-age girls have been arrested and
accused of terrorizing two elderly woman by pushing their way into
the women's apartment and demanding money while they tore the place
apart, police said.
   Tanya Williams, 16, and two 13-year-old females whose names were
withheld because of their age were arrested Sunday and charged with
first-degree robbery and first-degree burglary, said police Sgt.
Diane Kubler.
   The three teen-agers allegedly pushed their way into an
apartment occupied by 90-year-old Emma Otto and her 83-year-old
sister, Margaret Tellesen, on March 16, Kubler said.
   Tellesen said she let the girls in Wednesday when they asked to
use the bathroom. One of the 13-year-olds knew one of the women
through her mother, police said.
   The three scattered papers around the apartment, cut the
telephone line and threatened to kill the women if they did not
give them money, Kubler said. The three left after the women gave
them $50, she said.
   The three returned to the apartment Saturday, pushing their way
in and again threatening the women, the sergeant said.
   The three left after taking $300 in cash and two bank books,
Kubler said.
   Building owner Zack Kaimakliotis took the women to police after
the second robbery and detectives staked out the apartment.
   The three girls were arrested after they returned a third time
early Sunday. The girls told police they spent the money on
clothes, the newspaper reported.

<TEXT>
   The government's ``Superfund'' program
cleaning up toxic waste dumps should go back to its old policy of
seeking up-front payment commitments from polluters before
beginning work, an Environmental Protection Agency official says.
   Gene A. Locero says the program faces inevitable shortfalls as
it begins new cleanup projects before the polluting companies agree
to pay for the work.
   Locero is head of the waste programs enforcement office at EPA,
but plans to leave. On April 15, he will become a special assistant
to Administrator Lee M. Thomas.
   His gloomy analysis of Superfund's prospects appears in the
March-April issue of ``Environmental Forum,'' a publication of the
Environmental Law Institute.
   Locero's boss, Winston Porter, the assistant administrator whose
programs include Superfund, had not yet seen the article, his
office reported.
   For the first two years of the program, officials negotiated
with companies responsible for pollution at dump sites, trying to
win agreements to pay before substantial work was begun.
   But accusations of political influence on decision-making that
rocked the agency in 1983 and led to many resignations also led to
a new strategy _ if cleanup agreements aren't reached quickly, the
agency will start site investigations and cleanup work anyway and
seek reimbursement later.
   Amendments passed in 1986 that authorized an $8.5 billion
program over the next five years oblige the agency to start 175
cleanups by October 1989, and another 200 by 1991.
   Locero presented this worst-case analysis:
   ``If it is assumed that the agency will fund all the starts
itself, and that the average cost is $30 million for each action,
then by October 1989 the agency would need $5.25 billion for these
actions alone,'' and $6 billion more for the 200 actions to follow
by 1991.
   EPA now assumes each site will cost $21 million for cleanup
alone, not counting overhead _ an estimate that has more than
tripled in six years.
   Companies will obviously pay for some, but ``the agency's top
management officials do not dispute whether there will be a
shortfall, but only how much,'' Locero wrote.
   EPA now tends to seek ``all or nothing'' agreements from the
companies responsible for a site. The agency has little incentive
to craft the far more difficult agreements where some companies pay
for only some of the cleanup followed by court action against
recalcitrants.
   Locero says the court action is ``unlikely to be a priority''
and thus not much of a threat.
   To many companies that might settle with EPA, ``this is
equivalent to `shooting the volunteers,''' Locero wrote. ``This
dynamic, if not changed, reduces the likelihood that the agency can
look to (companies) for a greater share of the cleanup outputs it
is committed to.''
   Meeting the commitment means ``confronting the possibility once
again that outside observers, especially Congress, may criticize
the agency by slowing down cleanup by looking to more (company)
cleanups, or for entering into partial settlements that are too
favorable'' to the companies.
   The 1986 amendments recognized that remedial action may not be
able to achieve full restoration of every site, but ``some in the
agency fear that making remedy decisions that are less than full
restoration will provoke harsh and damaging criticism of the
program,'' Locero said.
   ``Unfortunately this has diverted attention to collecting more
and more data to justify decisions, which threatens to add more
time to the ever-increasing length'' of site investigations, he
added.
   Locero said the the agency must consider beginning cleanup
before the investigations are finished, and stop trying to make
cleanups that will be final.
   On sites that involve polluted groundwater, he said EPA should
consider installing pump-and-treat systems early in the first
months of a site investigation to capture the contaminant plume and
keep the groundwater resource from being polluted further and save
both time and money.
   ``In some cases, it might be just as appropriate ... to restrict
access as long as the result was adequate protection of human
health and the environment,'' Locero said.

<HEAD>Takeshita Says Japan To Maintain Defense Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told graduating
military cadets today that Japan's military power should match its
economic strength.
   ``We cannot cope with a military threat or maintain ties with
our allies and gain their trust without defense capabilities
commensurate with our national power,'' Takeshita told the 410
graduates of the National Defense Academy in Kanagawa prefecture,
west of Tokyo.
   Takeshita's speech was his first at the nation's only defense
college since he became prime minister last November.
   Takeshita said Japan would use its military only for defensive
purposes and would never threaten other nations.
   He said Japan's defense buildup would be attained within the
framework of the Japan-U.S. security treaty, while adhering to
Japan's three non-nuclear policies. Japan bans the manufacture,
possession and introduction of nuclear arms into Japan.
   The United States has been pressuring Japan to increase defense
spending and take more responsibility for its defense. But some
Asian nations, which suffered from Japanese aggression during World
War II, have expressed concern about a Japanese military build-up.
   Takeshita said Japan's security ``will not be guaranteed by its
military power alone'' and called for a comprehensive approach to
security, including diplomatic efforts and efforts to maintain a
continuous supply of natural resources from abroad, academy
spokesman Nobuo Tsuchida quoted Takeshita as saying.
   Last year, Japan formally scrapped a decade-old ceiling which
limited defense spending to 1 percent of its gross national
product. During the current 1986-90 defense buildup plan, the
government says Japan's defense spending will total $119.87 billion.

   King Hussein of Jordan today called on
Moslem nations to back protesters in the Israeli-occupied
territories and repeated that the the PLO must join any peace talks.
   ``The Palestinian people have a rightful claim on us to support
their uprising both on the national and international level so that
the uprising may bear fruit,'' Hussein said in opening a conference
of foreign ministers from the Organization of Islamic Conference.
The group includes 45 Moslem nations and the Palestinian Liberation
Organization.
   Hussein, a key player in any Middle East peace negotiations,
said: ``The uprising of the Palestinian people is not an end in
itself nor is it a transient coincidental event that will soon
wither away.
   ``It is rather an expression of the will of an entire nation to
fight for its freedom and right of self-determination in its own
land.''
   Hussein, in his remarks prepared for delivery to the conference,
gave no specifics of what kind of help he wants for the Palestinian
protesters.
   The protesters have been fighting Israeli occupation forces in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in an outbreak of violence that began
nearly four months ago. The United Nations reports more than 100
Palestinians have died in that time from gunfire, beatings, and
tear gas inhalation. The first Israeli soldier was killed Sunday.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
   In demanding that the PLO be included in peace talks, Hussein
parted ways with the United States, which subscribes to the Israeli
view of the group as an illegal, terrorist organization.
   Hussein also called on Iran to accept U.N. calls for a
cease-fire in its 7{-year-old war with Iraq. In the latest
escalation, the two nations have been hurling missiles into each
other's cities for the past three weeks.
   Hussein told those attending today's conference that the war was
a ``wound ... still bleeding and draining our resources and
energies.''
   Iraq has said it will stop shooting if Iran does. But Tehran has
said it will only comply with the U.N. appeal when Iraq is branded
the aggressor.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up Case Posing Issue Similar to Gramm-Rudman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
killing a key provision of a law designed to promote competitive
bidding on government contracts, setting the stage for a new ruling
on the boundaries between congressional and presidential powers.
   The court said it will hear Reagan administration arguments
challenging the comptroller general's role in administering the
1984 Competition in Contracting Act.
   The case raises issues similar to those in the constitutional
fight over the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law.
   the case stems from rejection by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers of a low bid submitted by Ameron Inc., a New Jersey
company, to repair sewer lines at the United States Military
Academy at West Point, N.Y.
   Although Ameron submitted a bid of $1.03 million, some $200,000
less than the next lowest bidder, it was rejected by the Corps
because of a problem with the bond supporting the bid.
   Ameron protested the rejection under provisions of the 1984
Competition in Contracting Act.
   The law empowers the comptroller general, a congressional
watchdog, to suspend the award of contracts and to award
bid-preparation costs and attorney's fees to companies that
successfully challenge the rejection of their bids.
   The law was prompted by alleged excess costs of awarding many
lucrative government contracts without competitive bidding. The
law's supporters said that in fiscal 1983 the government awarded
$114 billion in non-competitive contracts out of a total of $168
billion.
   Administration lawyers said the powers given the comptroller
general in the 1984 law are unconstitutional under the Supreme
Court's 1986 ruling in the Gramm-Rudman case.
   In that decision, the justices struck down the core provision of
the deficit-reduction law because it designated the comptroller
general as the official with power to set across-the-board budget
cuts. The court said such a function impermissibly blurs the line
separating the legislative and executive branches.
   The comptroller general is appointed by the president but can be
removed from office only by Congress.
   In the dispute over contract bidding, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said the comptroller general's powers under the 1984 law
are within constitutional bounds.
   The appeals court said the law ``rather than concentrating power
in the legislative branch ... diffuses and divides power, giving
final control over procurement decisions to the executive but
permitting meaningful oversight by an agent of Congress.''
   It said the comptroller general legitimately may delay contract
awards to assure that federal procurement officials pay attention
to his recommendations.
   The law is aimed at counteracting ``the apparent willingness of
procuring agencies to frustrate congressional inquiry by rushing to
complete challenged procurement projects,'' the appeals court added.
   Justice Department lawyers told the high court that the law
gives the comptroller general non-legislative powers to determine
``the timing of a contract between an agency of the executive
branch and a private party.''
   The law was defended by Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher
and by Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress.
   The case is Army Corps of Engineers vs. Ameron, 87-163.

   Iranian gunboats today attacked a
Liberian tanker and a Spanish refrigerator ship in the Persian
Gulf, setting them afire, and Norwegian officials said as many as
54 crewmen were believed killed in a weekend Iraqi raid.
   Maritime salvage experts, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the blaze today aboard the 10,168-ton refrigerator ship
Iberian Reefer was ``fierce.''
   Salvage tugboats were racing to aid the vessel, but there were
no immediate word on casualties, the officials said.
   Gulf-based shipping executives said earlier at least one Iranian
gunboat fired up to 10 rocket-propelled grenades at the 61,762-ton
Liberian-registered Fumi, setting its engine room ablaze and
blasting holes in one of its tanks.
   The Japanese-managed tanker, laden with Saudi Arabian oil, was
on its way out of the gulf. The executives said salvage tugboats
helped the Fumi's crew put out the fire.
   The Iranian attacks today were in apparent retaliation for an
Iraqi attack on Kharg Island oil terminal Saturday.
   The Norwegian Foreign Ministry in Oslo said as many as 54
crewmen were presumed dead in that attack.
   Most of the crew were Iranians or Asians, although a Swedish
officer was among the missing.
   If the Norwegian report is correct, it would be the highest
death toll from an Iraqi raid on Iranian vessels since the
so-called ``tanker war'' began in 1984, an offshoot of the
7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   About 480 ships have been attacked by one side or the other
since the war broke out. Until the weekend attacks, more than 200
seamen had been killed.
   Christen Puntervold of the Norwegian Shipping Association said
four of the 29-man crew of the tanker 253,837-ton Sanandaj had been
found alive after the attack Saturday.
   ``The others are missing. About the other ship, we don't know
for sure, but we are afraid it could be the same for them,'' he
said, referring to the 316,379-ton Avaj which also carried a crew
of 29.
   Both ships were owned by the National Iranian Tanker Co., but
Sanandaj's crew was enlisted by Viking Engineering, which is
Norwegian owned.
   Bahrain's Information Minister, Tariq al-Moayyed, called for
foreign naval forces in the region to guarantee the safety of
shipping lanes in the gulf, through which 20 percent of the
non-communist world's oil supplies pass.
   The minister, in an interview with NBC-TV urged the foreign
forces to ``reach a declaration ... that they will not allow
interference with freedom of shipping in the gulf.''
   Iraq, meanwhile, said it fired a long-range missile into Tehran
today, the 105th in three weeks, and that Iranian gunners pounded
its southern port city of Basra in an 18-hour artillery and rocket
barrage.
   There was no immediate report from Tehran of a missile strike.
   But the official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
Cyprus, reported that the missile was fired at 3:40 p.m. in
retaliation for the bombardment of Basra.
   It said there were ``heavy casualties'' in Basra, which the
Iranians were hammering in apparent retaliation for rocket and air
attacks on Tehran and other cities Sunday.
   Iran's official media said at least 33 civilians were killed and
65 wounded in those strikes.
   Both sides have fired nearly 250 missiles into each other's main
cities and border towns since Feb. 29, reportedly killing hundreds
of civilians.
   The Iranian news agency today reported scores of Kurdish
children, aged between 2 and 10 years old, were being treated in
hospitals for injuries suffered in Iraqi chemical bomb attacks
Thursday.
   The children were among 4,000 Iraqi Kurds Tehran claims were
injured in the Iraqi raids on towns captured by Iranian forces in a
new offensive.
   The Iranians have charged that 5,000 Kurds in the northeastern
towns of Khomal, Halabja and Dojaila were killed in the chemical
bombing raids.
   Iran claims it has punched 9{ miles into northeast Iraq in an
offensive launched a week ago.
   The Iraqis have admitted the loss of several towns in
Sulaimaniyeh province as Iran reported fighting still raging
between its Revolutionary Guards and Iraq's 5th Corps.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let states
and local governments regulate the prices most of the nation's
cable television operators charge for basic service.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the
deregulation effected in 1986 by Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission left subscribers vulnerable to illegal
monopoly pricing.
   Most of the nation's 7,800 cable operators provide both basic
and ``premium'' services. For an extra monthly fee, subscribers
receive channels offering exclusive sports and movie programming.
   Basic service includes local broadcast stations and a few cable
networks such as CNN, ESPN and C-SPAN.
   Prior to 1984, the FCC allowed local communities to regulate the
rates charged for basic cable service but not for premium service
rates.
   Congress in 1984 enacted the Cable Communications Policy Act,
which lets local authorities regulate basic cable rates only in the
absence of ``effective competition.''
   Defining ``effective competition'' was left up to the FCC, and
the commission's definition paved the way for the deregulation of
basic-service rates charged by more than 90 percent of all cable
operators.
   The commission's rule says any cable system faces effective
competition _ and avoids local regulation of basic-service rates _
if television viewers in the area can watch at least three
different channels without a cable hookup.
   The deregulation took effect Dec. 29, 1986.
   The prices cable operators charged for basic service rose an
average of 10.6 percent during the first six months of
deregulation, according to a survey released by the National Cable
Television Association.
   The survey indicated that premium-channel rates dropped 2.3
percent during the same period.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the commission
rule and basic-service rate deregulation last July 17.
   The appeal acted on today was filed by lawyers for Connecticut,
New York City, the National League of Cities and the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``The FCC committed procedural and substantive errors that will
... pre-empt state and local governments of traditional cable rate
regulation powers and will expose cable subscribers to monopoly
pricing,'' the appeal contended.
   Lawyers for the commission and the cable operators association
urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   The case is Connecticut vs. FCC, 87-671.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to examine the

   The court said it will consider killing a lawsuit by a Los
Angeles area union business representative who said he was fired

   Edward Lynn was elected to his position with Local 75 of the
Sheet Metal Workers union in 1981.
   He and other members of the local became increasingly critical
of how the union was spending its money, and organized a dissident
group that successfully defeated proposals to raise the local's
dues.
   The international association in 1982 placed Local 75 in
trusteeship and under the leadership of a regional official,
Richard Hawkins.
   Hawkins proposed a new dues increase that again was defeated,
with Lynn speaking out against the hike.
   Hawkins then filed charges against Lynn, and the international
union removed Lynn from office. He also was fined $2,500.
   Lynn sued in federal court in 1983, accusing union leaders of
firing him illegally and violating his free-speech rights.
   A federal judge threw out the suit but the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reinstated it.
   The appeals court said that because Lynn was elected to his
position as business representative he could not be fired for
taking a stand against policies proposed by other union leaders.
   ``Lynn's removal was precipitated by his outspoken opposition to
the proposed dues increase, a position which also reflected the
view of the majority of the union membership,'' the appeals court
said.
   Its decision drew a distinction between an elected union
official and one who is appointed.
   The Supreme Court in 1982 ruled that appointed union
administrators are not protected from dismissal when there is a
change in union leadership. The high court ruled then that business
agents of a Teamsters union local could be fired for supporting a
rival of the man elected president of the local.
   The 9th Circuit court said Lynn's firing was a different matter
because he was elected, and that he cannot be dismissed by the
parent union to suppress dissent.
   ``Just as the international may not impose a trusteeship for
illegitimate purposes such as suppressing dissent, so it may not
use the powers inherent in a legitimate trusteeship for similarly
illegitimate purposes,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Sheet Metal Workers vs. Lynn, 86-1940.

<TEXT>
   Shops and stores remained shuttered
today and thousands of soldiers toting M-16 rifles and tear gas
canisters patrolled the capital at the outset of a general strike
aimed at ousting strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Buses and taxis were operating normally, but many were empty or
were carrying fewer passengers than normal. Traffic was light.
   Many government offices appeared to be operating with limited
personnel, despite a government warning that public employees would
be suspended if they joined in the work stoppage.
   In the city's central business district, where six previous
strikes in the past nine months have had little effect, most stores
didn't open.
   Businessmen there have never before joined larger, wealthier
merchants and industrialists in a strike.
   ``We're sending Noriega a message,'' said the owner of one small
shoe store, who asked not to be identified. ``We hope he's
listening.''
   Helmeted soldiers in battle garb patrolled nearby. No violence
was reported early in the day.
   The government said the troops were deployed to assure transit
of buses and taxis and to provide security for businesses and store
owners that wanted to open despite the strike call by the National
Civic Crusade.
   Many of the transportation companies are owned by the Panamanian
Defense Forces and those that aren't require government licenses to
operate.
   Aurelio Barria, head of the opposition National Civic Crusade,
said Sunday the government may try to use an emergency decree to
forcibly open industries and businesses that close during the
strike.
   The indefinite work stoppage was called after Noriega, commandr
of the Defense Forces and the force behind the civilian government,
rejected a U.S. plan for his removal as ``unacceptable, illogical
and anti-Panamanian.''
   Noriega, who has been indicted in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, reportedly told William Walker, a U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state, he wanted to remain in Panama and
help from a transitional government.
   Walker and Michael Kozak, a State Department legal officer, were
said to have offered Noriega freedom from U.S. extradition if he
sought asylum in a third country. They met with the general and his
high command on Friday.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, appearing Sunday on NBC's
``Meet the Press,'' said Noriega ``can't expect to have any say in
the transition.''
   The Panamanian government has responded to recent unrest with a
state of emergency allowing it to suspend civil rights and take
over private businesses.
   ``The next few days are the determinant time,'' said Barria. He
predicted the strike ``will be very, very successful.'' The Civic
Crusade is an umbrella coalition of groups seeking Noriega's
downfall.
   Barria also said Sunday he heard meetings had been held within
Panama's Defense Forces to discuss what to do about Noriega, and
Barria said he expected some action by the military this week.
   But Maj. Augusto Villalaz, who had been one of Noriega's
personal pilots before defecting last week, said Noriega had
loyalists and Cuban arms to keep him in power.
   Villalaz told ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' on Sunday
that he had flown three shipments of arms to Panama from Cuba and
that Noriega planned to import 500,000 pounds of weapons.
   On Sunday, many Panamanians flocked to supermarkets to stock up
on food, flashlights and other essentials to last through the
coming strike.
   Barria confirmed Sunday he had met with the papal nuncio, Msgr.
Jose Laboa, but denied persistent reports that the church official
was mediating a solution between Noriega and the opposition.
   Barria previously said Noriega approached opposition leaders
with an idea for a ``Panamanian solution'' to the crisis that would
allow the general a future role in the military. But the crusade
rejected the idea, Barria said.
   ``We don't have anything to negotiate with him except his
departure,'' Barria said, ``the day and the flight number.''
   In Panama City's Pacific port area of Balboa, dock workers
striking because they have not been paid their full salaries vowed
to keep the docks shut down today. The union has run out of
emergency food bags and its 800 members have not received wages for
two weeks.
   Panama's already ailing economy was sent into a tailspin last
month after Noriega's indictment and the effort of then-President
Eric Arturo Delvalle to fire the general, who heads Panama's
15,000-member Defense Forces. Noriega allies in Parliament on Feb.
26 ousted Delvalle, who has since been in hiding.
   The Reagan administration retaliated by backing the freezing of
Panamanian government bank deposits in the United States, creating
a critical cash shortage in Panama, which uses the dollar as its
currency.

<HEAD>Court Asks Administration Comment on Case from Hawaii</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today sought the Reagan
administration's views of an appeal by Hawaii officials seeking to
roll back an annual $10.5 million increase in intrastate telephone
rates.
   The court asked Justice Department lawyers to comment on a lower
court ruling that the state lacks authority to block the higher
rates.
   The high court is not expected to decide whether to grant full
review to the case until hearing from the government lawyers, which
could take months.
   The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission in 1984 granted a $20
million rate increase to Hawaii Telephone Co., $10.5 million less
than the company requested.
   The company then filed a federal lawsuit, charging that the
reduction violated an order of the Federal Communications
Commission.
   Generally, the FCC regulates interstate phone rates while state
public utility officials regulate intrastate rates.
   But the commission in 1981 adopted a plan to reduce interstate
rates for phone users in Hawaii, bringing the charges into line
with interstate rates for people in the 48 contiguous states.
   The lower rates were to be phased in over four years in an
effort to avoid a dramatic impact on rates for in-state calls.
   The Hawaii Telephone Co. said the commission plan bars state
officials from imposing the $10.5 million reduction.
   A federal judge agreed with the company, and that ruling was
upheld last September by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said the commission properly pre-empted the
state's authority in this case.
   ``No one disputes the authority of a state ... to establish a
reasonable rate of return for utilities within its jurisdiction,''
the appeals court said. ``But ... (Hawaii's) adjustment here was a
fairly transparent and improper attempt to circumvent the FCC
mandate.''
   The appeals court said the commission has priority in
apportioning the cost of equipment and other expenses between
in-state and out-of-state service.
   The case is PUC vs. Hawaiian Telephone Co., 87-1152.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Airline Worker Issue in TWA Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether an airline may be forced to reinstate workers when their
strike ends, making necessary the layoffs of trainees and employees
who crossed the picket lines.
   The court said it will study an appeal by Trans World Airlines
in a dispute stemming from a 1986 strike by flight attendants.
   TWA and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants had a
three-year contract that expired July 31, 1984. When negotiations
failed, the union called a strike on March 7, 1986.
   TWA hired more than 1,220 new flight attendants after the strike
began. In addition, about 1,280 TWA flight attendants crossed
picket lines either at the outset of the walkout or as the strike
continued for more than two months.
   TWA also placed new flight attendants in training, including 463
who had not completed training when the strike ended May 17, 1986.
   The union then filed a federal lawsuit charging TWA with
unlawfully refusing to reinstate more than 2,000 workers who had
gone out on strike.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last May that some
striking flight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at the
expense of all trainees and some flight attendants who had crossed
the picket lines.
   The appeals court said the strikers should be reinstated if they
had more seniority than those, called cross-overs, who had not
honored the picket lines.
   But the appeals court also said the 1,220 flight attendants
hired during the strike could not be dislodged by any of those who
stayed out during the strike.
   With regard to the cross-overs, the 8th Circuit court said they
may not be given preferential treatment over striking workers with
more seniority ``because such action impermissibly discriminates
among union members based on the degree of their union activity.''
   ``An employer may not divide the workforce into those who
engaged in strike activity and those who did not,'' the appeals
court said.
   It said the 463 trainees cannot be considered permanent
replacements in the same category as the 1,220 newly hired flight
attendants. Therefore, the trainees ``were subject to displacement
by returning strikers,'' the appeals court said.
   The distinctions were made under the Railway Labor Act, which
governs airlines as well as railroads.
   TWA said it is ``simply incomprehensible'' to force employees
choosing not to strike to give up their jobs in favor of
``unsuccessful strikers.''
   By a 4-4 vote on March 2, the Supreme Court ruled in another
case growing out of the 1986 TWA strike that an airline may be
forced to continue collecting union dues from workers after its
contract with employees has expired.
   TWA sought to discontinue the dues check-off after the strike
ended. But the justices' split vote automatically upheld an 8th
Circuit court ruling that the airline may not cancel the check-off
provision unless it is agreed to in negotiations with the workers.
   The case is TWA vs. Independent Federation of Flight Attendants,
87-548.

   The Supreme Court today turned away a legal
dispute sparked by controversy over the health of former Sen. Paula
Hawkins, R-Fla.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the public
has no right of access to pretrial statements and other materials
generated by civil lawsuits.
   Lawyers for The Miami Herald had argued that denying public
access to all unfiled pretrial materials in civil cases violates
the Constitution's First Amendment.
   In a related case, the justices last November let stand a
Florida Supreme Court ruling that the public has no right to hear
or see pretrial statements, called depositions, given during
criminal prosecutions.
   In the case acted on today, the Florida court extended its
ruling on pretrial materials in criminal cases to depositions and
other pretrial materials in civil cases.
   Hawkins, who lost her Senate seat in the 1986 election to
Democrat Bob Graham, a former Florida governor, injured her back in
a 1982 accident at television station WESH in Orlando.
   She sued in early 1986, charging that the accident _ a studio
set wall fell on Hawkins while she was taping a talk show _ was
caused by the station's negligence.
   The lawsuit alleged that Hawkins' injury became a physical
handicap that impaired her ability to work.
   While pretrial proceedings were underway, Hawkins continued her
work in the Senate and actively sought re-election. But as a result
of the lawsuit's allegations, her health became a major issue in
the campaign coverage.
   In October 1986, about two weeks before the election, the
Orlando Sentinel sought to intervene in the lawsuit between Hawkins
and WESH and compel access to pretrial documents, including
hospital and medical records.
   Two other newspapers, The Miami Herald and the Florida Times
Union in Jacksonville, filed similar requests.
   Hawkins settled her lawsuit out of court in June 1987 but the
Herald continued its effort to obtain the pretrial documents.
   Under Florida law, those documents are not routinely placed in
public court files.
   The Supreme Court last July 2 ruled against granting access. It
relied on its earlier decision denying public access to pretrial
depositions in criminal cases.
   The Herald then filed the appeal acted on today.
   The case is Miami Herald Publishing Co. vs. Gridley, 87-1193.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today sent back to a lower
court a dispute over a racial-quota integration plan for a public
elementary school in Chicago.
   The justices told the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to study
whether a challenge by a group of whites, Cubans and American
Indians to quotas at the Walt Disney ``magnet'' elementary school
has become moot.
   The court did not explain why it believes the case may have lost
its legal relevancy but the Chicago Board of Education contended
that the children on whose behalf the original lawsuit was filed
now are too old to attend the school.
   The Disney school was opened in 1968 on Chicago's north side to
promote integration. Students were selected by lottery to reflect
the racial, ethnic and economic composition of the area.
   The school is considered a ``magnet'' because it offers special
educational opportunities designed to attract a cross-section of
the community.
   Many cities in the nation have adopted the magnet concept as a
key element in integrating public schools.
   Chicago officials incorporated racial quotas at the Disney
school as part of the school system's overall integration plan
adopted in response to a complaint by the federal government
charging segregation. The city signed an agreement in 1980 with
federal officials, promising to implement a citywide integration
plan.
   The quotas at Disney were challenged in 1981 by parents of
Cuban, American Indian and white children. Those children were told
they would be admitted to the school but two months later were
informed they could not attend because the quotas had been adjusted
in the interim.
   The quotas require that white students comprise 15 to 35 percent
of the school's population, and that minorities comprise from 65 to
85 percent.
   The Disney plan was upheld by a three-judge panel of the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The panel said that Chicago's
citywide desegregation plan already had been upheld in previous
federal court rulings, precluding any attack on the quotas at the
Disney school.
   The students excluded from Disney ``are indeed necessarily
attacking the desegregation plan as a whole by challenging its
effect upon them,'' the panel said.
   The students' parents then asked for a review of their appeal by
all 10 members of the 7th Circuit court. By a vote of 6-4, the
judges refused to hear the case.
   Judge Frank H. Easterbrook of the 7th Circuit, in voting to hear
the case, said, ``Chicago has not been found to have engaged in
racial discrimination in operating its schools. Some such finding
... is essential before children may be shuffled from one school to
another on account of their race.''
   He added that the children who were barred from attending the
Disney school were being deprived of educational opportunities they
may be unable to receive at any other public school in the city.
   The case is Samayoa vs. Chicago Board of Education, 86-1503.

<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra independent counsel has evidence
that Richard Secord and Albert Hakim skimmed nearly $1 million from
bank accounts containing money from the arms sales to Iran, a
newspaper reported today.
   The money was used by Secord and Hakim to invest in arms, food
and real estate businesses for their personal gain, the Chicago
Tribune reported, citing unidentified sources close to the
investigation by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   According to the report, Secord and Hakim transferred the money
from Swiss bank accounts in three installments from August to
November 1986. The two reportedly used $760,000 from the accounts
to buy a one-third interest in Forway Industries, a military supply
company in New Jersey, and $50,000 on a plan to work with Forway to
market a laser sight for night weapons firing, the newspaper said.
   The Tribune said Walsh obtained some of his information through
the help of Willard Zucker, an attorney and financial adviser who
has been granted immunity from prosecution. The Geneva-based Zucker
managed the Swiss bank accounts and allegedly set up shell
corporations to mask the diversion of $18 million of the money paid
by the Iranians, the Tribune said.
   A federal grand jury indicted Secord and Hakim, along with Lt.
Col. Oliver North and former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter last week on charges of conspiring to siphon the profits
from the Iranian arms sales and use the money for the benefit of
the Contras fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. It also
accused Secord, Hakim and North of using some of the money for
personal gain.
   The four have said they would plead innocent at an arraignment
Thursday.
   The indictment also charged Secord and Hakim of conspiring to
pay illegal gratuities to North.
   Zucker and a spokesman for Walsh declined to comment about the
matter, the Tribune said.
   Secord was in meetings today and unavailable for immediate
comment, said Joan Corbin, a secretary at Washington, D.C.-based
American Trade Consultants.
   Secord's attorney, Tom Green, was traveling and also unavailable
to comment immediately, said Julie Linwood, a secretary at Green's
Washington, D.C. law firm.

Governor's Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive some
allegations previously raised in former Massachusetts Gov. Edward
J. King's $3.6 million libel lawsuit against the Boston Globe.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that three
editorial cartoons, one editorial and two columns King sued over,
did not libel him.
   The high court earlier this month cleared the way for a jury
trial on King's claim he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, column
written by David Farrell, who since has left the newspaper.
   State courts threw out most of the ex-governor's claims in
pretrial proceedings, ruling that the sued-over comments and
cartoons amounted to constitutionally protected expressions of
opinion.
   King, who served as the state's governor from 1979 through 1983,
contended that he was libeled in various cartoons and articles,
most of which were published in 1981.
   ``Cartoons are seldom designed to disclose facts but rather are
ordinarily understood by reasonable viewers to be rhetorical,
exaggerated means of expressing opinions,'' the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court said in ruling on King's suit last Aug. 17.
   The state court said the other articles ordered dropped from the
suit also fell ``within the ambit of protected opinion.''
   The case is King vs. Globe Newspaper Co., 87-1259.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
$150,000 libel award won, and then lost, by a Joplin, Mo.,
policeman against his local newspaper.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that officer
Don R. Speer failed to prove the Joplin Globe acted with ``actual
malice'' when it accused him in an editorial of using excessive
force.
   The controversy stems from an April 23, 1983, demonstration
outside a downtown Joplin bar.
   About two dozen protesters picketed the bar that evening because
most of its patrons were homosexual.
   Speer was sent to arrest the demonstrators because they had not
obtained a parade permit.
   While making the arrests, Speer got into an altercation with Max
McCoy, a Globe reporter who was taking photographs of the
demonstration and arrests.
   McCoy, who sustained injuries and whose camera was broken, told
Globe editors that Speer and other police officers used excessive
force.
   An April 24 article reflected both McCoy's and the police's
versions of the incident.
   An editorial published two days later condemned Speer's conduct,
stating that while McCoy was ``cuffed and defenseless, the officers
continued to strike him, kick him.''
   Speer sued the paper's publisher, Ottaway Newspapers Inc., in
federal court, contending that the editorial had libeled him.
   A jury awarded him $100,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000
in punitive damages but the trial judge threw out the award. The
judge ruled that Speer, treated as a public figure for purposes of
the lawsuit, had not proved actual malice.
   Public figures who sue for libel must prove that the statement
was false and published with knowledge or reckless disregard of its
falsity. Private individuals who sue for libel have an easier task:
They must prove the statement was false and published through
negligence.
   In upholding the trial judge's ruling, the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled last Sept. 9 that McCoy had nothing to do
with publication of the editorial at issue.
   ``A finding of institutional actual malice by the Globe may not
be based only on McCoy's state of mind,'' the appeals court said.
   It added that Globe editors knew McCoy ``as a trusted employee
and believed him to be reliable, honest and good with details.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Speer argued that the
appeals court ruling will spur newspapers to ``compartmentalize
their fact-finding and writing functions since liability can only
be imposed by persons occupying the latter status.''
   The appeal added, ``Rewarding a newspaper for the calculated
deceit of an employee it retains to gather information ...
constitutes an unnecessary denigration of the individual's right to
the protection of his own good name.''
   The case is Speer vs. Ottaway Newspapers, 87-942.

<TEXT>
   A jury today began its fifth day of deliberation
in the murder trial of a young man accused of strangling a teen-age
woman in Central Park, where they walked from a popular watering
hole.
   The jury returned to the courtroom this morning and listened to
a reading of testimony from Dr. Robert C. Shaler regarding body
fluid stains on the victim's jacket.
   During deliberations Sunday, jurors asked Justice Howard E. Bell
to restate the charges against Robert Chambers and asked if they
could take notes.
   Bell allowed that, but admonished the jurors to also listen
carefully. It is highly unusual for New York juries to be allowed
to take notes.
   Chambers, 21, is charged with second-degree murder in the Aug.
26, 1986, strangulation of Jennifer Levin, an 18-year-old woman he
had met in an Upper East Side bar frequented by affluent young
people.
   The jury could convict Chambers of the lesser crimes of first-or
second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide.
   The prosecution has charged that Chambers used Miss Levin's
blouse to strangle her, while his lawyers maintain he accidentally
killed her when she hurt him by squeezing his genitals during rough
sex.

   A resurgent right battered the
governing Christian Democrats in municipal and legislative
elections, according to early returns today.
   The result of Sunday's balloting, in which hundreds of thousands
participated despite threats of guerrilla violence, sets the stage
for a rough final year in office for President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, a Christian Democrat.
   The leftist guerrillas had called for a boycott of the voting,
and the sizeable turnout was hailed by politicians as a triumph for
democracy and a demonstration of civic spirit.
   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, won the
mayor's post in San Salvador from the Christian Democrats, who had
held the position for the past 24 years. They also appeared assured
of a majority in the 60-seat National Assembly, according to
projections made by local television stations.
   The Christian Democrats currently hold 33 seats. Arena has 13.
   The ``Areneros'' apparently benefited from a wave of popular
discontent with the Christian Democrats.
   Duarte was elected in 1984 on a platform of ending the war and
improving the economic situation. But four years later, the war
that has taken 65,000 lives grinds on, an estimated 40 percent of
Salvadorans are unemployed and inflation is running at an annual
rate of about 40 percent.
   Arena's campaign slogan was ``Change for the better,'' which
apparently struck a chord in the electorate.
   Prior to the election, the Chistian Democrats themselves had
conceded they would be set back by the vote, citing the natural
erosion of support experienced by a party governing in troubled
times.
   Arena national chairman Alfredo Cristiani told a news conference
Sunday night his party, if it gained control of the legislature,
would work with the Christian Democrats to resolve the country's
pressing problems.
   ``We will not present a systematic and capricious opposition. We
must look for unity regarding certain crucial points,'' he said.
   In the San Salvador mayor's race, Armando Calderon Sol, the
candidate of the rightist alliance, beat Alejandro Duarte, the
Christian Democratic candidate and son of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte.
   ``I want to publicly recognize that Mr. Calderon Sol has won,''
Duarte said at a news conference Sunday night. He congratulated the
Salvadoran people for voting despite threats of violence from
leftist guerrillas.
   ``This day was a glorious gesture of the Salvadoran people,'' he
said. ``We have defeated the terror and violence of the left.''
   The third party presenting candidates nationwide was the
National Conciliation Party, another rightist group. Leftist
parties declined to present candidates, saying the war made fair
elections impossible.
   State-run Channel 10 television, citing unofficial preliminary
counts, estimated 66 percent of the 1.6 million registered voters
had cast ballots. It said that, according to its projections, Arena
would win an outright majority in the assembly.
   Mario Samayoa, president of the electoral council, also hailed
the electorate for turning out to vote.
   He also said there had been no allegations of fraud by any party
from any polling station in the country.
   In a bid to disrupt the election, leftist guerrillas blew up
electrical lines, cutting energy to much of the country Saturday
night. However, little violence was reported during the election
Sunday, apart from rural skirmishes in the central part of the
country. No casualties were immediately reported.
   Power was returning gradually to some regions by today.
   Today was the first day since Friday that Salvadorans could
expect normal transport. The Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, an alliance of five guerrilla armies, lifted its
3-day-old road travel ban as of midnight Sunday.
   The rebels had termed the election ``a farce'' and called for a
boycott.
   ``To vote is a duty, the way we demonstrate we are Salvadoran
citizens,'' said Pablo Castellano, a 38-year-old peasant farmer in
Nejapa, 10 miles north of San Salvador. He had walked 10 miles in
the blazing sun to cast his ballot.
   The guerrillas had warned polling places would be considered
``military objectives'' because of the wide deployment of soldiers
to provide election security.
   They had stepped up urban violence in the 10 days prior to the
voting. Three car bombs exploded in San Salvador, wounding three
people.
   Voters were electing all 60 members of the National Assembly,
the unicameral legislature, and mayors and town councils for 262
municipalities nationwide.
   The guerrillas, who have been fighting since 1979, demand a
share of power in exchange for laying down their arms. The
government rejects the demand.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, with four of nine justices
on the sidelines, today refused to kill a 13-year-old lawsuit
stemming from an armed confrontation between Indians and federal
agents at Wounded Knee, S.D.
   The remaining five justices, citing the lack of a quorum,
automatically upheld a federal appeals court ruling that clears the
way for a trial on allegations that the government's use of Army
troops in the 1973 incident violated constitutional rights.
   The suit names former presidential aide Alexander Haig,
ex-attorney general Richard Kleindienst and 10 other federal or
military officials as defendants.
   On Feb. 27, 1973, an armed group of Indians with grievances
about the federal government's handling of Indian affairs occupied
the village of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
   The FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs
police sealed off the village by setting up roadblocks. Before the
71-day standoff ended, two Indians were killed and a deputy marshal
was wounded.
   Fourteen people, most of them residents of the Pine Ridge
Reservation, sued in 1975. Their suit contends they were confined
unconstitutionally because Army troops helped maintain the
roadblocks and an armed perimeter around Wounded Knee.
   The suit relies heavily on a federal law, the Posse Comitatus
Act, that bans use of the Army or Air Force as a civil police force.
   Because the use of Army troops violated federal law, it also
violated the individuals' constitutional protection against
unreasonable government seizures, the lawsuit says.
   People who allege they were subjected to a constitutionally
impermissible search or seizure may sue the offending officials for
damages.
   U.S. District Judge Donald J. Porter in South Dakota threw out
the suit but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it in
1986.
   The Supreme Court last year agreed to review the 8th Circuit
court's ruling, and today's brief, unsigned opinion upheld that
ruling.
   The 8th Circuit court said the involvement of Army troops was
``affirmatively forbidden by a criminal law of long standing,
itself expressive of an authentically American tradition of even
longer standing.''
   While acknowledging that a seizure that violates federal law
does not necesarily violate the Constitution, the appeals court
said violations of the Posse Comitatus Act represent ``a special
case.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy disqualified
themselves from the case without explanation.
   The case is Haig vs. Bissonette, 86-987.

   The PLO defied an eviction deadline today
to vacate its U.N. observer mission under a U.S. anti-terrorist law
as the General Assembly met in emergency session to consider ways
to keep the mission open. A court battle appeared likely.
   The PLO observer, Labib Zehdi Terzi, made no move to shut the
13-year-old mission in a townhouse near Park Avenue and said he was
awaiting U.S. legal action against the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   ``Once we see what they do, then we will respond,'' he said in
the U.N. Delegates Lounge. He said last week that U.S. authorities
would have to drag him away.
   But no confrontation or physical move to shut the mission was
expected. The U.S. government said that if the PLO does not leave
the United States voluntarily, then it would initiate legal action
this week to make it move. But U.S. officials say they will allow
litigation to run its course.
   The United States has declared the PLO a terrorist organization,
but the United Nations recognizes it as the only legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people. It was invited to New
York by the United Nations.
   The PLO's counsel, former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, said
that if the United States files suit against the PLO, he will seek
to dismiss the complaint.
   Envoy Terzi said it is up to the United Nations to go to court
on behalf of the PLO.
   In the emergency session which started Friday, all speakers
denounced the U.S. move to close the PLO Mission and 50 more
speakers were scheduled this week.
   Today and Tuesday the assembly is scheduled to consider calls by
some delegates to take legal action on behalf of the PLO and to
house the mission on U.N. international territory _ off limits to
U.S. police.
   The PLO participates in all debates on the Middle East but has
no voting rights.
   Some delegates also want to move the next 159-member General
Assembly to Geneva in September or to shift the special session on
disarmament in May and June to Geneva, but such moves are unlikely.
   This week the assembly is expected to adopt a resolution calling
on Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to take all necessary
action, including legal steps, in defense of the Headquarters
Agreement.
   The Justice Department was expected to initiate legal action in
Manhattan Federal Court probably by Wednesday to close the mission,
department spokesman Patrick Korten said in Washington on Sunday.
   ``We're ready to go ahead and file the papers if they don't
close the mission voluntarily,'' he said.
   Clark has said the closure order is illegal because it violates
the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters treaty under which the United
States allows U.N. missions to operate.
   Clark said the anti-terrorism law of 1987 and legal efforts to
oust the PLO are unconstitutional because they conflict with
international law. He said the U.N. Headquarters Agreement takes
precedence over U.S. domestic law.
   The anti-terrorism law was attached to a State Department
spending bill and requires closing the PLO Mission by today.
   The State Department and United Nations opposed the legislation
on grounds it violates U.S.-U.N. treaty obligations. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz called it ``a very bad piece of
legislation'' which unnecessarily glorifies the PLO.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether public officials may be sued when their alleged gross
negligence permits a child to be abused by a parent.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal on behalf of a
Wisconsin boy who at age 4 was seriously and permanently brain
damaged from beatings by his father.
   Social workers were accused of violating the child's
constitutional rights by failing to come to his rescue after they
had repeated evidence he was being beaten.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out the
suit against the Winnebago County, Wis., Department of Social
Services and two of its employees.
   The boy, Joshua DeShaney, first came to the attention of the
welfare agency when he was brought to a hospital in 1983 with cuts
and bruises. The girlfriend of Joshua's father said the boy was
injured in an attack by another child.
   Officials suspected he was being abused by adults. A social
worker, Ann Kemmeter, was assigned to the case.
   Joshua was returned to the custody of his father, Randy
DeShaney, with a recommendation that DeShaney's girlfriend move out
of the house because DeShaney had hinted she might be abusing the
boy.
   DeShaney's former wife and Joshua's mother, Melody DeShaney, was
living in Cheyenne, Wyo., where the couple had been divorced.
   A month after the first hospital visit, Joshua again was treated
for suspicious injuries.
   Ms. Kemmeter visited the DeShaney home on several occaisons and
noticed bumps on Joshua's head. The boy also was treated again at a
hosptal for various bruises and injuries. Also, DeShaney's
girlfriend still was living at the home.
   Ms. Kemmeter visited the DeShaney home on March 7, 1984, and was
told that several days earlier Joshua had fainted in the bathroom
for no apparent reason. But according to court records she did not
ask to see the boy.
   The following day Joshua was treated at a hospital for head
injuries that destroyed half his brain, leaving him profoundly
retarded and institutionalized for the rest of his life.
   The boy's father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to
two to four years in prison.
   The county social services department and its employees were
sued by Joshua's mother on grounds the boy was deprived of liberty
without due process.
   The 7th Circuit court said in dismissing the suit, ``If the
defendants, though blameworthy, did not cause Joshua's injuries,
they cannot be said to have deprived him of his liberty.
Deprivation implies causation.''
   The appeals court continued, ``It is unlikely that Ann
Kemmeter's well-intentioned but ineffectual intervention did Joshua
any good at all. But it is most unlikely that it did him any harm.
She merely failed to protect him from his bestial father.''
   The appeals court added that Ms. Kemmeter ``failed to act on
mounting and eventually overwhelming evidence that Joshua was in
great peril from his father.''
   But the appeals court said it would place welfare agencies in an
unfair predicament to require them to take custody of children who
are suspected victims of abuse.
   ``To place every state welfare department on the razor's edge,
where if it terminates parental rights it is exposed to ... suit by
the parent ... and if it fails to terminate those rights it is
exposed to ... suit by the child, is unlikely to improve the
welfare of American families and is not grounded in constitutional
text or principle,'' the appeals court said.
   In her appeal to the Supreme Court, Mrs. DeShaney said the 7th
Circuit court ruling is in conflict with decisions by other appeals
courts.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Left unresolved whether public school students enjoy any
constitutional protection against paddling or other corporal
punishment by teachers and administrators.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling in a New Mexico case that ``at some degree of excessiveness
or cruelty'' such punishment violates constitutional rights. But
another appeals court has rejected that view.
   _ Refused to let the Dalkon Shield's maker set up a $15 million
emergency fund to help women who say the contraceptive device left
them infertile.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that blocks
creation of the fund pending the outcome of bankruptcy proceedings
for A.H. Robins, which manufactures the device.
   In a related case, the court refused to review a ruling that at
least temporarily barred some Dalkon Shield users from suing Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., which insures A.H. Robins for liability
claims.
   _ Rejected a constitutional attack on a federal law requiring
broadcasters to give equal time to opposing candidates for public
office.
   The justices, without comment, turned down the appeal of a
Sacramento, Calif., television reporter kept off the air while he
ran for a non-salaried town council seat.
   _ Agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed
to promote competitive bidding on government contracts, setting the
stage for a new ruling on the boundaries between congressional and
presidential powers.
   The court said it will hear Reagan administration arguments
challenging the comptroller general's role in administering the
1984 Competition in Contracting Act.
   _ Agreed to decide whether states may impose sales taxes on most
books, newspapers and magazines while exempting religious
publications.
   The justices said they will review a Texas court ruling that
said such a tax neither violates equal-protection rights nor
breeches the constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   _ Refused to let states and local governments regulate the
prices most of the nation's cable television operators charge for
basic service.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the
deregulation effected in 1986 by Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission left subscribers vulnerable to illegal
monopoly pricing.
   _ Agreed to examine the power of labor unions to fire elected
officials for disagreeing with union policies.
   The court said it will consider killing a lawsuit by a Los
Angeles area union business representative who said he was fired
illegally by the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association.
   _ Agreed to consider shielding states from having to help pay
for cleaning up hazardous waste sites when the federal government
sues businesses under the so-called Superfund law.
   The court said it will hear arguments by Pennsylvania officials
that exposing states to such liability could saddle them with $100
billion in clean-up costs.
   The child-abuse case is DeShaney vs. Winnebago County, 87-154.

   Lt. Col. Oliver North's request to retire from
the Marine Corps later this spring has received final approval from
the Navy, Pentagon officials said today.
   North, the fired national security aide who was indicted last
week in connection with the Iran-Contra affair, also has received
permission to start using up his accumulated leave and will no
longer have to report for work at Marine Corps headquarters.
   ``Lt. Col. North began his terminal leave today,'' said Lt. Col.
John Shotwell, a Marine Corps spokesman. ``He had sufficient leave
on the books to cover the period from now until his retirement on
May 1.''
   North announced Friday that he had decided to retire from active
duty, saying the step was necessary because he would likely have to
subpoena ``the highest ranking officials in our government'' to
defend himself against the Iran-Contra charges.
   ``That strikes me as a course of action incompatible with my
continued service as a Marine officer,'' North said at the time.
   ``Accordingly, with great sadness, I have tendered my request to
retire from the Marine Corps.''
   North becomes eligible to retire with a military pension on May
1 _ the point at which he will have spent 20 years on active duty.
He automatically had the right to request retirement on that date,
but needed a waiver of a requirement that he provide at least four
months' advance notice of his plans.
   That waiver was approved by Chase Untermeyer, the assistant Navy
secretary for manpower and reserve affairs.
   North was reassigned to Marine Corps headquarters on the
planning staff in November 1986 after President Reagan fired him as
an aide to the National Security Council.
   North, former national security advisor Rear Adm. John
Poindexter and two others were indicted by a federal grand jury
March 16 on charges they conspired to divert Iranian arms sales
profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The 23-count indictment, which also named retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim, said
the defendants organized, directed and concealed ``a program to
continue funding of and logistical and other support for military
and paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a time
U.S. law barred such action.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let the
Dalkon Shield's maker set up a $15 million emergency fund to help
women who say the contraceptive device left them infertile.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that blocks
creation of the fund pending the outcome ofbankruptcy proceedings
for A.H. Robins, which manufactures the device.
   In a related case, the court refused to review a ruling that at
least temporarily barred some Dalkon Shield users from suing Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., which insures A.H. Robins for liability
claims.
   Robins, facing massive damage claims from hundreds of thousands
of women, filed for bankruptcy in 1985 to protect the company's
assets. Its intrauterine device allegedly caused pelvic
inflammation, spontaneous abortions, infertility and, in a few
cases, death.
   Robins filed for bankruptcy under what is known as Chapter 11, a
law that allows debtors to protect assets while repaying debts
under a court-devised plan.
   The company stopped marketing the Dalkon Shield in 1974 but did
not actually recall the product until 1984.
   Robins reported on March 7 that it had a fourth-quarter loss of
$1.69 billion in 1987 due to funds set aside for Dalkon Shield
injury claims. The company reported an $81.8 million profit for the
year.
   The case acted on today involving the $15 million fund centered
on an attempt by Robins to trim some of its losses and to provide
immediate money for women who could undergo corrective surgery or
become pregnant through in vitro fertilization.
   That procedure involves fertilizing the woman's egg outside her
womb.
   Robins said the surgery, costing approximately $15,000 per
woman, or the in vitro procedure would give women approaching the
end of their safe child-bearing years a chance to have children.
   `Many claimants who used the Dalkon Shield when it was
introduced in the early 1970s are approaching the biological
deadline,'' the company said. It added that the emergency fund
serves humanitarian purposes and makes good business sense because
it could reduce claims against Robins by women whose fertility is
restored.
   Lawyers representing women suing the company also supported the
idea. The fund was approved last May 21 by U.S. District Judge
Robert R. Merhige Jr. in Richmond, Va., who is presiding over
nationwide claims against Robins.
   Merhige separately has ordered Robins to create a $2.48 billion
trust fund to pay some 200,000 claims against the company. Robins
had paid $500 million in damages before filing for bankruptcy.
   In a related development, American Home Products Corp. is
proposing to take over Robins for $3 billion.
   The emergency $15 million fund that is the subject of today's
Supreme Court action was opposed by owners of Robins stock. On Nov.
3, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the stockholders'
favor.
   The appeals court said the federal bankruptcy code prohibits
creation of the emergency fund because it would give preferential
treatment to some with claims against Robins. The money cannot be
spent while reorganization of the company is pending in bankruptcy
proceedings, the appeals court said.
   In the case involving Aetna, federal lawsuits were filed in
Kansas and New Hampshire by thousands of women seeking damages from
the insurance company.
   They said Aetna was at fault because Robins delegated to it
responsibility for monitoring the performance of the Dalkon Shield
and deciding whether it should be recalled. The women also accused
Aetna of covering up evidence that the devices were defective.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in September blocked the
lawsuits, at least until the bankruptcy proceedings are concluded.
   The appeals court said, ``Inevitably, Aetna must involve Robins
in this litigation. Aetna's primary defense logically will be that
Robins _ not Aetna _ is responsible for the injuries suffered.''
   The appeals court continued, ``Robins will inexorably be drawn
into this litigation ... (and) it will detract from the
(bankruptcy) process.''
   The cases are Mabey vs. Official Committee of Equity Security
Holders, 87-1267, and Oberg vs. Aetna, 87-1208.

   ;
   NEW YORK (AP) _ Four people were arrested today in the beating
death of a man who was chased and attacked by an angry mob after he
snatched $20 from a woman in a bakery, police said.
   Residents of nearby buildings watching the chase from their
windows yelled encouragement as the man was pummeled Sunday,
reflecting their growing hostility to the street crime and crack
dealers in the neighborhood, police said.
   The crowd of more than a dozen people used sticks and their bare
hands to beat the man, identified by police as Raymondo Carraballo,
41, of Manhattan. One man grabbed a garbage can and banged it down
on the man's chest as he lay on the sidewalk and then others used
the can to hit him again and again, said Sgt. Ed Burns, a police
spokesman.
   Police have ruled the death a homicide. Sgt. John Clifford, a
police spokesman, refused to provide the names of the four suspects
or any other information.
   Two Housing Authority police officers rescued Carraballo and
took him to Housing Authority headquarters, Burns said.
   From there an ambulance took Carraballo to Mount Sinai Hospital,
where he lost consciousness and died Sunday evening, Burns said. An
autopsy was scheduled.
   The beating took place in front of the Jefferson Houses, a
public housing project in the East Harlem section around the corner
from the Capri Bakery, where the suspect grabbed $20 from
21-year-old Anna Beteran, Burns said.
   As Carraballo ran out of the store, Beteran and her unidentified
sister-in-law chased him and yelled at a group of passers-by that
he had stolen her money.
   The crowd chased Carraballo and caught him around the corner.
Between 15 and 20 people joined the pursuit, but it was unclear how
many actually took part in the beating, Burns said.
   Burns said Carraballo had no previous criminal record, but
apparently was a drug addict. ``His arms were covered with needle
tracks,'' he said.
   Police said several people had been questioned but no arrests
had been made and no weapons recovered.
   ``At this point we don't have any of the weapons, but we know by
the comments on the 911 calls for help that many forms of weapons
were used,'' Burns said.

<HEAD>Former Communist Fighter Hester R. McCullough Dies at 71</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRYN MAWR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hester R. McCullough, once a heroine of
the political right for her 1940s stand against entertainers
associated with communist causes, is dead at 71.
   Mrs. McCullough died at home Sunday.
   In the late 1940s, Mrs. McCullough, then living in Greenwich,
Conn., returned a $6 subscription ticket to a performance by dancer
Paul Draper and harmonica player Larry Adler, whom she accused of
being members of communist-front organizations.
   In a letter to the Greenwich Community Concert Association that
was published in a local newspaper, Mrs. McCullough wrote that the
entertainers, ``while fine artists, have been openly denounced in
the press as being pro-communist and, as such, I do not believe
should appear in any community project in Greenwich.''
   Draper and Adler sued Mrs. McCullough for libel, but they
decided not to pursue the case when it ended in a hung jury in
1950. By then it had become a cause celebre taken up by
conservative columnists such as Westbrook Pegler.
   In later years, Mrs. McCullough said she had no regrets.
   ``What I thought then, I still do,'' she told The Philadelphia
Inquirer Magazine in a 1987 interview. ``The communists themselves
wanted to destroy this country and its government.''
   Mrs. McCullough was born in Philadelphia, graduated from London
University when she was 19 and became a secretary at the former
Pennsylvania Military College, now Widener University.
   She married John T. McCullough, a Harvard graduate, who worked
for Time magazine.
   Mrs. McCullough is survived by a son, Bruce, of Hollywood, Calif.

   The Irish Republican Army shot
dead a policeman today, two days after a mob at an IRA funeral
killed two British soldiers.
   Police said the policeman was shot in the head in a jeep in the
Roman Catholic Creggan district of Londonderry, and died at a
hospital.
   The IRA claimed responsibility in a clandestine message to
Belfast media.
   The officer, whose name was not made public immediately, was the
23rd person and the second policeman to die in the British province
this year.
   Police sources said today about 30 suspects were being sought in
connection with the mob attack Saturday on two British soldiers.
The outlawed IRA also claimed responsiblity for the killings of the
soldiers.
   Irish and British newspapers said a police roundup of suspects
in Catholic strongholds in Belfast was imminent.
   Police made no formal statement, but the sources, requesting
anonymity, said suspects were identified by studying videotape of
Saturday's rampage, in which the two soldiers were beatend and
stripped naked by the crowd and shot by IRA gunmen.
   Three suspects were arrested immediately after the killings.
   In the Catholic Markets district of West Belfast, police seized
600 pounds of ``explosive material'' early today and said they
arrested a woman.
   In London, Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King announced today
an immediate review of its new policy of not policing Irish
Republican Army funerals following the killings Saturday.
   In all, five people died during burials or funeral corteges in a
four-day period last week.
   King said a ``massive murder investigation is under way'' in the
soldiers deaths.
   Concerning the search for the killers of the soldiers, a
statement by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Ireland
police force, said only that, ``Inquiries are being actively
pursued.''
   But police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
about 30 suspects were identified after officers scrutinized film
of the slayings.
   The British army said Sunday the two soldiers had ignored
general orders to stay away from the Irish Republican Army funeral
procession.
   The men's commanding officer in Belfast, Lt. Col. Martin
Roberts, said in a radio interview today that the men must have
driven into the area by mistake.
   ``Obviously, the soldiers drove into the funeral cortege by
mistake and tried to escape and in the process they were hemmed in
by the black taxis,'' said Roberts, who is commander of the army's
communications in Northern Ireland.
   An army helicopter assigned to film the funeral in Catholic west
Belfast hovered overhead as corporals Derek Wood, 24, and David
Howes, 23, were killed. King flew to Belfast on Sunday for
briefings from army and police chiefs and was shown the
helicopter's film of the attack.
   Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux claimed the two soldiers
were ``sacrificed'' to the new policy of not policing IRA funerals
while 500 members of the security forces were on standby in the
city.
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
also blamed the soldiers' slayings on the new policy. He called on
King and the police chief, Sir John Hermon, to resign.
   But Conservative lawmaker Michael Mates said scrapping the new
policy could mean more violence. ``A return to heavy-handed
policing could provoke riots, which is what the IRA want so they
can say to the world: they won't even let us bury our dead in
peace,'' he said.
   The mainly Catholic IRA wants to drive the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
   On Wednesday, as security forces stayed away from Belfast's
Milltown Cemetery for the funerals of three IRA members slain by
British forces in Gibraltar, a Protestant gunman killed three
mourners and wounded 68 with grenades and bullets.
   The two soldiers slain Saturday interrupted the funeral of Kevin
Brady, 20, one of the three killed in Milltown Cemetery.
   A statement from the IRA, which said its members shot the
soldiers after identifying them, said the mourners thought they
were being attacked when the soldiers' car sped toward them.
   Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, blamed the British
government for the violence and praised those who beat the soldiers
for their ``bravery in protecting the cortege from attack.''

   George Bush picked up the endorsement of New
Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean today, while Democrat Albert Gore Jr.
got kind words but no endorsement from New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
and Richard Gephardt got the same from Chrysler Chairman Lee
Iacocca.
   The meetings came one day after Bush swept to his 23rd
primary-season victory in Puerto Rico and after Democrats Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson recorded good weekend showings in Kansas,
Texas and Puerto Rico.
   Most of the Democrats were campaigning today in Michigan, where
caucuses Saturday offer the next big delegate prize of the season,
while Bush flew to New Jersey for a rally.
   In meetings today with well-known non-candidates:
   _Kean endorsed Bush in New Jersey, saying as Bush stood
alongside him at a rally, ``We need a president who doesn't
apologize for what's wrong with America, but who brags about what's
right. We need a president who doesn't have his eyes fastened on
the failings of the past, but who gazes steadily at the
opportunities of the future.''
   _Cuomo said in Albany, N.Y., said he'd had an ``excellent'' and
``interesting'' meeting with Gore, but he told reporters he is
still not ready to endorse a Democratic presidential hopeful. ``The
endorsements don't mean a great deal,'' Cuomo said.
   _In Michigan, Iacocca said, ``Dick Gephardt's a good friend of
mine and he knows what he's talking about on trade.'' But he made
no endorsement and said he also was looking forward to meeting with
other presidential candidates.
   Gephardt led the Democratic parade into Michigan, talking with
auto executives and steel workers as he works for the victory he
must have here to rescue his campaign.
   ``What does it profit this nation to conquer Grenada if we are
losing the auto industries of Pontiac, Flint and Detroit?'' the
Missouri congressman told Michigan Democrats over the weekend.
   Wisconsin looks like the next major battleground for the
Republicans, after Bush won his latest victory in the Puerto Rico
primary on Sunday. The vice president won with ease over Sen. Bob
Dole, who admitted that he has done little to slow down Bush's
drive for the GOP nomination.
   ``I still have a lot of supporters out there,'' Dole said in
Milwaukee. ``We want them to know Bob Dole is a fighter, that we're
going to stay in this race. ... I've got a lot of hill to climb
before April 5'' and the Wisconsin primary where polls give Bush a
big lead.
   Bush picked up the 14 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico,
boosting his total to 788. That's nearly 70 percent of the 1,139 he
needs to win at the national convention in New Orleans this summer.
Dole, who hasn't won an event since Feb. 23, has only 178. Former
television evangelist Pat Robertson had 17.
   In Puerto Rico, Jackson won the non-binding preference poll with
Dukakis running second and Simon third. But it was a fight more
about local matters than presidential politics.
   The 51 delegates from Puerto Rico all ran as uncommitted, and
the campaigns promised major efforts to woo them in coming weeks.
   Dukakis won the Kansas caucuses on Saturday, picking up 16
delegates. But Jackson rode strong urban support into a surprising
second place and 14 delegates.
   ``It's the first farm and agriculture state that I've won and
won decisively,'' Dukakis said at a dinner in Detroit on Saturday
night. ``I think that's a very good sign for the future. ... Now
we're on to Michigan and here we are.''
   In Texas, Jackson appeared to do better, splitting the delegates
there in county conventions that were the next step in allocated
at-large delegates for the state. That gave Jackson a one-delegate
edge over Dukakis in the Texas national delegate count _ including
both the primary and caucus results _ but more complete returns
could change that.
   In South Dakota, a Saturday caucus followed the results of the
Feb. 23 primary and gave Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri the No.
1 spot in state delegates.
   All that activity left the latest AP delegate count this way:
Dukakis, 526.5; Jackson, 508.55; Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee,
362.8; Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, 171.5; and Gephardt, 154. Of
those chosen, 343.65 were uncommitted. To nominate, 2,082 delegates
are needed.
   Michigan's Saturday caucuses offer 138 to be divided up, and a
weekend poll suggested Dukakis and Jackson were far ahead in that
battle as well.
   A Detroit News survey of 38 likely caucus-goers gave the
Massachusetts governor 33 percent and Jackson 30 percent _ a
virtual tie. Gephardt had 14 percent in the survey conducted March
15-17, with the others trailing.
   Dukakis and Gore sounded the traditional party themes in
Michigan, where auto industry troubles have thrown thousands out of
work.
   ``We're not going to sit on the sidelines while our neighbors
are thrown out of work and America's hometowns are boarded up and
left to die,'' Dukakis told the party dinner in Detroit on Saturday.
   Gore emphasized that ``I'm a friend of organized labor and
always will be. I believe it is time to put the White House back on
the side of working men and women.''
   Simon, who is looking to Wisconsin for victory, admitted that
``I'd be fooling you if I said we expected to win in Michigan'' as
he campaigned through the state.

<HEAD>Report Says Chinese Hoard Color TVs For Corrupt Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1 million color televisions, one of
China's hottest consumer items, lie unwatched in warehouses partly
because suppliers use them for barter and influence, it was
reported Monday.
   There were more than 900 cases of illegal trade involving
400,000 color TVs last year, said the China Daily, quoting a report
in the Gongren Ribao Workers' Daily.
   The nation made 6.7 million color sets last year, 62 percent
more than in 1986. However, about one-sixth of them were in
warehouses despite heavy consumer demand, the report said.
   The newspaper blamed part of the problem on poor distribution.
   It also decried ``unsound tendencies'' among suppliers and
distributors who hoard the sets. The newspaper said color sets
``have acquired a kind of bargaining power and can be used to
obtain favors.''
   The director of one TV factory reportedly obtained steel only
after giving sets to suppliers. Some supply departments used sets
as leverage to gain other best-selling products and unload
unpopular ones, the newspaper said.

   Villagers trying to rescue a donkey
from a dam dived for cover when they saw what had trapped its hind
leg: a wooden box containing a surface-to-air missile.
   Soldiers called to the village near the town of Filabusi in
southwestern Zimbabwe found eight more of the Soviet-made missiles
after scouring the dam, according to Elephant News, a Zimbabwe
military magazine.
   ``The missiles were intact and had never been used,'' the
magazine quoted Capt. Mike Mandiringa, commander of the search
party, as saying. ``If it were not for the donkey, they would still
be in the water.''
   The officer said he believed the missiles were stored in
villagers' huts by guerrillas during the seven-year war that led to
Zimbabwe's independence from Britain in 1980.
   The villagers apparently dumped the weapons in the dam when the
war ended, he said.
   Guerrillas fighting the white minority government of Ian Smith
in that conflict were supplied with an unknown quantity of
heat-seeking missiles.

<HEAD>Poultry Farmers Protest U.S. Turkey Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry poultry farmers threw live chickens
and eggs at a U.S. diplomatic office Monday during a protest of
imported American turkeys.
   The 3,000 farmers also took their protest to the Bureau of
Foreign Trade, where they pelted a senior government official with
eggs.
   During the demonstration outside the American Institute in
Taiwan, farmers shouted ``We don't want U.S. turkeys!''
   One protester cried out, ``Slogans are useless!'' and the
farmers threw 30 live chickens and dozens of eggs into the
institute compound. Visa applicants, reporters and policemen
outside the building also were hit by the eggs.
   Farmers argue that chicken prices have fallen more than 50
percent in five months because the United States has made Taiwan a
``dumping ground'' for turkeys.
   They gave a petition to officials at the institute, which
handles diplomatic matters between the United States and Taiwan in
the absence of formal relations.
   The protesters then went to the Bureau of Foreign Trade and
threw eggs at Vincent Siew, the bureau's director general, when he
spoke with the farmers but failed to promise an immediate ban on
turkey imports.
   Siew told demonstrators that allowing U.S. turkey imports was
part of a plan to help reduce Taiwan's huge trade surplus with the
United States, which Taipei said reached $16 billion last year.
   Taiwan officials want to lower the surplus to reduce U.S.
protectionist sentiment.
   Siew spoke to the farmers in a gynmasium near the bureau office
but had to leave under riot police escort as farmers yelled: ``Step
down, Vincent Siew!'' The demonstrators dispersed four hours after
the protest began.
   Siew is a member of the Taiwan-U.S. Trade Committee, which
recommended easing restrictions on U.S. turkey imports. The Cabinet
still must approve the decision.
   The American Institute in Taiwan said U.S. turkeys accounted for
less than 1 percent of Taiwan's poultry market and did not hurt
local farmers. It said the price slump was caused by overproduction
and inadequate distribution and marketing.
   Demonstration leader Chen Tung-fang, president of Taiwan's
Poultry Association, argued that chicken farmers have suffered an
average monthly loss of $21 million since U.S. turkey imports
increased in November.
   Agriculture Council officials said Taiwan imported 2,261 metric
tons of turkeys from the United States last year, up 142 percent
from a year earlier.
   An earlier demonstration was held Wednesday, when about 5,000
fruit and poultry farmers marched through Taipei streets to protest
the government decision to import turkeys and more fruit from the
United States.

<HEAD>Justices Will Consider Expanding Application of RICO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
making it easier for people to use a federal anti-racketeering law
to sue businesses.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by phone customers in
Minnesota who have accused Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. of
trying to bribe state public utility officials.
   The phone subcribers sued the company under a law known as the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
   They said the company beginning in 1980 tried illegally to win
rate increases by offering gifts, employment offers, tickets to
sporting and cultural events and other favors to members of the
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
   The suit was thrown out by a federal judge and that ruling was
upheld last September by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said the phone users failed to allege a
continuing pattern of racketeering activity required to make a case
under the RICO act.
   ``A single fraudulent effort or scheme is insufficient'' grounds
for a suit, the appeals court said. It said the phone customers'
``complaint alleges no more than a series of fraudulent acts
committed in furtherance of a single scheme to influence'' the
public utility commissioners.
   The Supreme Court is being asked to pick between various
theories of how difficult it should be to maintain such a lawsuit.
   The most expansive view would permit a RICO suit when there are
two related acts ``in furtherance of a single episode or a scheme.''
   A more restrictive view would be that a pattern of racketeering
activity exists only when there are multiple separate criminal
schemes or episodes.
   Those suing Northwestern Bell said there also is a middle road
that would permit such suits based on an analysis of various
factors, including the number and variety of alleged illegal acts,
the number of victims, the length of time of the activity and the
number of participants in the alleged scheme.
   They said the 8th Circuit court ruling conflicts with decision
by a number of other federal appeals courts.
   The case is H.J. Inc. vs. Northwestern Bell, 87-1252.

<HEAD>Long or Short, Elegance Wins at Chanel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sheer elegance at Chanel for next winter won
designer Karl Lagerfeld a roar of applause in his Monday
ready-to-wear show.
   The great choices in short or long skirts and pants were welcome
for Chanel fans, sometimes disappointed with Lagerfeld's recent
creative eccentricities.
   His sportier looks were based on glen plaid or tweed blazers
with lean skirts or pants, often topped with short fencers' capes.
   With feathered hats, it was vaguely Tyrolian, although there
were lots of familiar Chanel chain belts and buttons used
discreetly throughout. Gold buttons were de rigueur down the arms
and jackets of most suits.
   As a change from the familiar and much-copied chain and quilt
Chanel shoulder bag, there's a new model in bright red and green
plaids.
   One of the best jackets here was narrowed at the waist, had
curved lounging-jacket lapels, patch pockets with a pleat and came
in bright red, green or navy. It topped a swingy, pleated gray
skirt or pants.
   The trouser suits for day were in muted browns, grays or greens,
cutest with a nipped plaid bolero. Also in the Tyrolean vein were
the long or short gathered bold plaid skirts, dressiest when topped
with a clinging black sweater with lace yoke.
   There were blouses galore for all the easy pants, most often in
white Georgette silk crepe with pierrot, double-pleated ruffles and
wide flounced necklines.
   The longer suits _ often in navy or black _ were strictly lean,
but moved well. And in black velvet they had lovely touches of
double knit rows of ruffles or embroidered flowers, big and small.
   The fluid evening satin pyjamas with belted tunic tops in
searing colors could be sure-fire classic winners.
   Knits were super too, remarkable in ivory cable-knit cardigans
over gorgeous draped chiffon dinner dresses. In spite of some
peppy, full, bright skirts with lace, ribbons, crinolines and busy
tops, the overall statement was totally wearable chic.
   Kenzo's show was a cheery ode to fall. He too showed all lengths
with some Medieval-Renaissance touches. His best red suit with a
skirt just above the knee had an interesting sleeve puffed out
below the dropped shoulder.
   Kenzo's pants suits were lean and pin-striped for dandies, black
``smokings'' a la George Sand or had a Medieval look with page-boy
knickers, often with capes in rust or olive colors and sometimes
with big silk scarves with Renaissance portraits.
   Other graceful touches were in the colorful tweed and flowered
velvet fitted suits, again skirts mini to long. There was a lovely
``skyline'' inspired group of light challis wool and chiffon
dresses printed with puffy clouds.
   Maryll Lanvin's versatile approach featured well-cut clothes in
good fabrics. They looked young, but could be worn by any age.
   Lots of pants worked fine, especially topped by fitted, checked
cropped jackets or tiny boleros in autumn colors.
   Also remarkable were her short suits with very long jackets in
windowpane-checked bright yellow or royal blue. Other suits came
out in more subtle gray, tan or brick shades with full peplums on
the jackets.
   The best coat in hot tones of orange, fuschia and emerald turned
up in an egg shape and was worn with a neat piped suit underneath _
in a different sizzling shade.
   Cocktail looks turned elaborate, with drapes and puffs and
dazzling colors. They exuded a faint air of Ungaro, but were less
showy than his exaggerations.
   A safe but appealing party choice would be the romantic white
ruffled Victorian blouses over black draped silk sheaths.
   Paisley turned up here as all over the Paris shows, in soft,
full-skirted day dresses or as big borders on flounced black
numbers, or dresses with pointed handkerchief-panel skirts. And the
velvet paisley lounging pyjama suit was best of all.
   Sonia Rykiel, often best at her own familiar tunes, classic
knits, branched out at her winter show into quilted tops and suits
that were so puffy they made the wearer look like the Michelin man.
   But she had some excellent suits. An amethyst or flame short
knit suit with the jacket bowed in back had the Rykiel chic. And
her fitted caviar or houndstooth spencer suits were timely and
handsome, as were the graceful dark or tan solid-color suits,
nearly ankle-length.
   Evenings at Rykiel are best in the slinky, long black outfits
with sparkly details. Striped taffetas with big V-shaped panels in
front and full skirts in silvery grays lacked Rykiel's light touch
and ended up on the too-prim side of heavy Victorian.

<HEAD>Old Print is Rembrandt Etching, Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANLOO, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An old print that has adorned a wall
in a painter's cottage for decades is a genuine Rembrandt etching
worth about $53,500, an art expert said Monday.
   The 1626 print, titled ``Jesus' Circumcision in the Temple,'' is
the fifth known copy of the etching, said Theo Lorentzius, who
examined the artwork.
   The print, which measures 8 inches by 5 inches, also was
examined by experts of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, a center of
Rembrandt learning.
   The owner, painter Evert Musch, said he bought it about 40 years
ago from an art dealer in Groningen, a city 16 miles north of this
village in the northeastern Netherlands. He didn't recall what he
paid for it.
   ``I've always believed that the print was a genuine Rembrandt,''
Musch said in an interview with The Associated Press. The print
bears the signature ``Rembrandt fecit,'' Latin for ``Rembrandt

   Two weeks ago, Musch showed his print on a Dutch TV show about

   Musch said he planned to keep the print. ``It's far too

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up Age-Bias Suit from Pennsylvania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, agreeing to decide an
important issue for all lawsuits alleging age bias in employment,
said today it will study the case of a laid-off Pennsylvania man.
   The justices agreed to decide whether Eugene F. Brieck's lawsuit
against his former employer, Harbison-Walker Refractories, should
proceed to a jury trial.
   Harbison-Walker, a division of Dresser Industries, sells
specialized ceramic brick products primarily to steel producers.
Brieck worked as an installation specialist for Harbison-Walker
from 1965 to 1982.
   In July 1982, several employees of Harbison-Walker's Iron and
Steel Marketing Support Group were laid off, including Brieck. He
then was 55.
   Brieck sued Harbison-Walker in Pittsburgh in 1984, contending
that he was laid off and not recalled to work because of his age.
His lawsuit pointed to a 39-year-old installation specialist with
less seniority who was not laid off until November 1982 and then
recalled eight months later.
   Lawyers for Harbison-Walker contended that the other employee,
Hugh Faust, was retained because of his more diverse work
experience.
   But Brieck alleged that such diverse capabilities played a very
small role in the job Faust performed.
   U.S. District Judge Gerald J. Weber threw out Brieck's suit,
ruling that Harbison-Walker had articulated legitimate,
non-discriminatory business reasons for laying off Brieck while
retaining a younger man with less seniority.
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Brieck's
suit last June 19.
   The appeals court ruled that an employer charged with violating
the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act cannot avoid trial
by articulating legitimate business reasons if the suing employee
presents ``a reasonable inference that the employer' proffered
explanation ... is unworthy of credence.''
   The appeals court added: ``The question is not whether the
employer's asserted reason is plausible, but whether there is also
evidence of record which, if credited, could render the reason
implausible.''
   In seeking Supreme Court review, lawyers for Harbison-Walker
argued that the appeals court ruling ``virtually eliminates summary
(pretrial) judgment in employment discrimination cases.''
   The case is Harbison-Walker vs. Brieck, 87-271.

   A bomb exploded in a four-story apartment
building in Moslem west Beirut today, and police said several
people were believed buried in the rubble.
   The blast occurred at 7 p.m. in the Tarik Jedideh district.
   Civil defense rescue teams and ambulances rushed to the scene,
police said. They had no further details.
   Meanwhile, in Tripoli, 50 miles north of Beirut, an unfinished
eight-story building collapsed at daybreak, burying six
construction workers, police reported.
   They said one worker was rescued after six hours. Although
rescue teams reported hearing moans beneath the wreckage, hopes
were fading at nightfall that any of the others would survive.
   Police said the cause of the building collapse in Tripoli was
not immediately known.

   Vice President George Bush won
Puerto Rico's Republican primary and added 14 more national
convention delegates to his tally, while Jesse Jackson won the
Democrats' non-binding ``beauty contest'' balloting.
   With 35 percent of the precincts reporting, Bush picked up 98
percent of Sunday's vote. GOP rival Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas had
received just 2 percent.
   Bush had an overwhelming 1,935 votes compared to just 48 for
Dole in ballots that had been tallied. ``Bush has the 14
delegates,'' said local GOP chairman Luis Ferre.
   The vast majority of Puerto Ricans chose to vote in the
Democratic primary. With 91 percent of the precincts reporting,
Jackson led with 87,757 votes, or 32 percent, followed by
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis with 70,733 for 26 percent.
   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon was third with 57,639 votes or 21
percent. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 45,361 for 17 percent,
and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt had received 9,159 or 3 percent
of the votes.
   The Democratic primary had no effect on the candidates' delegate
totals for the Democratic National Convention next July in Atlanta.
The 33 delegates at stake Sunday, who will choose another 18
delegates, have said they will go uncommitted to the convention.
   In all, Puerto Rico will send 56 delegates to the convention,
including Gov. Raphael Hernandez Colon and four other party leaders
who automatically receive delegate seats. Leaders say the
delegation intends to vote as a bloc.
   Puerto Rico's two main political parties, Hernandez Colon's
Popular Democratic Party and the out-of-power New Progressive
Party, predicted that 1 million voters would cast ballots. New
Progressives in general favor statehood for Puerto Rico while
Popular Democrats do not.
   The turnout was less than half what was expected, possibily
because the system approved by the State Election Commission
required voters to register beginning at 9 a.m. but prohibited them
from voting until after 2 p.m. The system was set up to prevent
double voting.
   In 1980, the Republican presidential primary was held two weeks
before the Democratic primary. New Progressive Party voters cast
ballots first for George Bush, a longtime proponent of statehood
for Puerto Rico, and then for Jimmy Carter. The Popular Democratic
Party supported Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy eight years
ago.
   GOP chairman Ferre said many Republicans probably did not vote
because of the confusion caused by Dole backers who tried to call
off the primary and choose delegates instead by caucus. The issue
was not settled until two days before the primary when a Superior
Court judge ruled it must be held.
   In preliminary figures released shortly after noon, the
commission reported the PDP slate ahead of the NPP slate by 373,950
votes to 297,408, with most of the 1,650 polling stations
tabulated. A total of 671,358 valid votes were counted.
   PDP officials claimed they won at least 29 Democratic convention
delegate seats, and perhaps all 33 that were at stake.
   ``What we have seen in these primaries is a prelude of what will
happen in November'' when the two parties meet again in
gubernatorial elections, said Hernandez Colon, who is running for
re-election.
   The victory touched off PDP celebrations that included
fireworks, speeches and a merengue band at party headquarters, and
a caravan that wound its way, horns tooting and loudspeakers
blaring, through the Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra sections of
the capital at 2 a.m.
   Ex Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo, who headed the NPP slate,
conceded his delegates lost, but said, ``we are not defeated. The
defeated don't continue to fight and we are in a fight (against the
PDP) from today on.''
   Romero Barcelo faces a primary on June 12 against San Juan Mayor
Baltasar Corrada del Rio for the NPP nomination for governor.
Losing Sunday may have weakened his standing in the party.
   Aside from a test of strength between Hernandez Colon and Romero
Barcelo, at issue was control of the local Democratic party, whose
leaders will be chosen by the 33 delegates elected Sunday.
   The NPP wants Puerto Rico to become the 51st U.S. state. The PDP
wants things to remain as they are _ with Puerto Ricans as U.S.
citizens with almost every right and obligation except they cannot
vote for president in the general election and do not pay federal
taxes.
   Anticipating trouble between the rival parties, the police
department canceled days off and vacations, and stationed 3,000
officers at or near polling stations and party offices. The sale of
alcoholic beverages was prohibited from midnight Saturday to Sunday
night.
   There were no reports of violence.

<TEXT>
   A woman who put a job-wanted ad in a
newspaper was recruited as a communist spy and trained to
photograph secret documents with a camera disguised as a cigarette
lighter, officials said Monday.
   The woman, arrested Friday in Bonn, hid film taken for her
Soviet bloc spymasters in a specially constructed can of hairspray,
prosecutors said.
   She used at least 26 locations in Bonn to deliver documents and
pick up instructions from other communist agents, they added.
   Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said investigators were assessing the
damage to national security caused by Elke Falk, who worked in the
West German chancellery from 1974 to 1977 and in other ministries
later.
   ``The suspect delivered notes, copied documents and photographs
from all of her professional duties to her intelligence contacts,''
Rebmann said.
   Ms. Falk is being held in investigative custody awaiting formal
charges, Rebmann said. Security officials have not identified the
Soviet bloc intelligence agency for which she allegedly worked.
   Ms. Falk was a secretary in the Economic Coooperation Ministry
at the time of her arrest Friday, hours after officials disclosed
the defection of a high East German transport official who
apparently led authorities to her.
   She was the chief secretary to Volkmar Koehler, No. 2 man in the
Economic Cooperation Ministry, until 1987 and later moved to the
ministry's European section, officials reported.
   Ministry spokesman Manfred Oblaender said Ms. Falk had access to
``very confidential and secret documents'' provided to the ministry
by West German intelligence agencies.
   Rebmann told reporters Ms. Falk was recruited by a man using the
name Gerhard Thieme after she placed an advertisement in a
newspaper looking for work. On Sunday, the mass-circulation
newspaper Bild reported that Ms. Falk began syping after Thieme
seduced her.
   In its Monday editions, Bild said Ms. Falk had access to
top-secret military and defense documents while working at the
chancellery.
   Quoting security sources it did not identify, Bild said she also
had access to transcipts of meetings between former Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt and foreign leaders, including former Presidents
Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford.
   According to Rebmann, communist agents warned Ms. Falk in 1985
that she might be exposed. She told West German authorities she
stopped spying at that time and destroyed her equipment, but
ignored urgings by communist contacts to flee to the East, he said.
   He said Ms. Falk was paid about $11,760 for the information she
delivered.
   Bild quoted the security sources as saying Ms. Falk's activities
represented the most serious security breach since the arrest of
Guenther Guillaume, a top aide to former Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   Brandt was forced to resign as chancellor in 1974 after
Guillaume was exposed as a spy.
   In the last major West German spy scandal, 15 communist agents
were arrested or disappeared between August and December 1985.
Among them was Hans-Joachim Tiedge, the man in charge of catching
East German spies, who fled to East Germany.

<HEAD>Jazz Great Dies In Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gil Evans, a composer, pianist and band leader
who made his mark with innovative arrangements with jazz great
Miles Davis, has died in Cuernavaca, Mexico, at the age of 75.
   Evans died Sunday of peritonitis while recuperating from
prostate surgery, his widow, Anita, said today in New York.
   Evans had been active until recently, playing at a New York club
in December and January. He went to Cuernavaca to recuperate from
his operation, taking his synthesizer to work on new compositions.
   An upcoming tour will proceed as planned, with Evans' son Miles
leading the Gil Evans Orchestra, Mrs. Evans said.
   ``Gil left tones of music to be carried forth,'' Mrs. Evans said.
   Jazz historian and writer Leonard Feather said Evans made his
mark with innovative arranging, particularly in three records by
trumpeter Miles Davis. The albums, ``Miles Ahead,'' ``Porgy and
Bess'' and ``Sketches of Spain,'' showcased Davis' cool style.
   ``They were really among the most brilliant orchestral jazz
records made by anybody,'' Feather said. ``He made brilliant use of
tone colors.''
   Evans was born Ian Ernest Gilmore Green in Toronto, Ontario, on
May 13, 1912. His parents were Australian and he grew up in
Stockton, Calif., starting his first jazz band while in high school.
   He led a band in Stockton from 1933 to 1938, and from 1941 to
1948, except for three years of Army service, he arranged for the
Claude Thornhill Orchestra.
   He experimented with bebop with Davis, Gerry Mulligan and John
Lewis, worked as a free-lance arranger in New York and gained
recognition for a reunion with Davis in 1957 that resulted in
``Miles Ahead.''
   In 1958 he started recording with his own band. His arrangements
always had a fuller, more orchestral sound than most jazz and swing
bands. In recent years, Evans had added electronically amplified
instruments for a more commercially acceptable sound.
   Evans had recently had worked on a record album with Helen
Merrill, and Davis told Mrs. Evans last week that he had written a
new tune, titled ``Gil Evans.''
   The upcoming tour included appearances at the JVC Jazz Festival
here and appearances in London and at the Umbria Jazz Festival in
Italy, Mrs. Evans said.
   A memorial service will be held in New York, probably on Easter
Sunday, Mrs. Evans said. Evans' sons, Noah and Miles, were with him
in Cuernavaca when he died.

   Here is a summary of developments Sunday and today involving
Nicaragua, Honduras, the United States and El Salvador:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UNITED STATES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   American soldiers engaged in military maneuvers Sunday at a
Honduran airstrip just 20 miles from the Nicaraguan border, but
U.S. officials said the threat from Sandinista troops had subsided
and combat appeared unlikely.
   President Reagan sent 3,200 U.S. military personnel to
non-combat areas in Honduras last week after the Central American
nation reported that Nicaraguan forces had crossed its border to
raid bases of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels.
   Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the U.S. national security adviser, said
in Washington the U.S. military exercises should be completed
shortly and the troops will return to the United States.
   The Reagan administration indicated support for a new $48
million proposal for aid to the Contras that was advanced by a
bipartisan group of senators.

<HEAD>NICARAGUA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Contra and Nicaraguan leaders met today in Sapoa, Nicaragua, for
the first cease-fire talks held inside Nicaragua.
   Nicargua announced that it would suspend military operations for
the duration of the talks.
   On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco reiterated
a previous Sandinista position that the negotiations strictly deal
with the mechanics of a cease-fire. Rebel leaders said the talks
must also focus on ``democratization of Nicaragua and free
elections.''
   Earlier, Nicaragua formally protested a Honduran bombing raid on
Sandinista positions Saturday as an unwarranted act of aggression.
It has denied that its troops crossed the jungle-choked border
dividing the nations.

<HEAD>HONDURAS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo on Sunday said Nicaraguan troops are
retreating from Honduras and the U.S. soldiers probably won't be
needed much longer.
   Honduran officials said Saturday's air raid on Sandinista
positions was carried out because about 600 Nicaraguan troops were
moving too slowly from a section of the Bocay area that Honduras
considers its territory.

<HEAD>Stevens Wants Japan To Pick Up Full Cost of Its Defense</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should order American troops and
military installations pulled out of Japan unless the Japanese do
much more to pay for western defense, Sen. Ted Stevens said Monday.
   Stevens said that because of the strength of the Japanese
economy and its favorable trade balance with the Unite States,
Tokyo should be able to foot the bill for its own defense.
   ``The yen has conquered a great portion of American,'' the
Alaska Republican told a group of Pentagon officials during a
hearing of the Senate Appropriations military construction
subcommittee. ``Now that the Japanese economy is going full tilt,''
Japan should pay the full cost of keeping U.S. troops and
facilities in that nation, Stevens said.
   Stevens said he was ``putting the Pentagon on notice'' that he
plans to offer a bill next year that would require U.S. military
withdrawals from Japan.
   Stevens said his proposal would be similar to legislation which
was routinely sponsored _ and just as routinely defeated _ by
former Sen. Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., calling for U.S. troops to be
withdrawn from Europe. Mansfield is now U.S. ambassador to Japan.
   ``Mansfield was right,'' Stevens said.
   The United States has been pressuring Japan to increase defense
spending and take more responsibility for its defense. Those calls
have been particularly loud on Capitol Hill, where Japan has come
under increasing criticism for its trade policies.
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Monday that
Japan's military power should match its economic strength.
   Japan last year formally scrapped a decade-old ceiling which
limited defense spending to 1 percent of its gross national
product. During the current 1986-90 defense buildup plan, the
government says Japan's defense spending will total $119.87 billion.
   Japan pays about 40 percent of the $5.9 billion cost of
maintaining U.S. facilities in the country.
   Richard Armitage, assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs, told Stevens that Congress
shouldn't engage in ``Japan-bashing.''
   Japan is increasing its defense budget, Armitage said, and the
spending total ``is on the verge'' of passing the British, French
and West German defense budgets.
   ``We should look beyond the popular ally-bashing rhetoric of a
campaign year,'' Armitage said.
   Stevens responded that he would have offered his proposal this
year, but ``it shouldn't be an election-year issue.''
   Japan is now meeting all its mutually agreed defense goals,
Armitage said, and is building up its naval fleet.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the subcommittee, told
Armitage that ``this burden-sharing issue is not going to go
away.'' The congressional criticism ``is the reflection of a deeply
felt concern among the American people'' that U.S. allies should do
more.
   On other matters, Sasser said ``there are good signs'' that NATO
will come up with a new home, probably Italy, for the 401st
Tactical Fighter Wing in Spain. The Spanish government earlier this
year formally asked that the wing's 72 F-16s be removed from
Torrejon air base outside Madrid.
   Congress has banned the spending of any U.S. money to relocate
the wing. Instead, the cost will be picked up by NATO.

   Five Army Pershing II missiles were
flight-tested today at the Air Force space and missile test center
range.
   The missiles were successfully fired by NATO troops from West
Germany under battlefield conditions, said Dave Harris, a spokesman
for the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Ala.
   The Pershings have been banned from use under an arms treaty
signed by President Reagan and Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but
the treaty has not yet been ratified by the Senate.
   The Pershing is a field missile launched by its own erector and
can be carried anywhere, towed by a truck. Each of the missiles
cost $4 million.
   The missiles were launched separately during the morning from
8:01 a.m until 11:53 a.m., Army officials said.

<TEXT>
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
today the Reagan administration is ``very encouraged'' by a new
congressional plan to send aid to the Contra rebels, but said other
suggestions were also welcome.
   ``We anticipate signing on to a bill, in the sense that we want
a Contra aid package, and we are working to get the best one that
we can get,'' Fitzwater told reporters. ``I think something will be
very forthcoming very soon.''
   The $48 million plan, which would permit the delivery of as much
as $2.5 million worth of previously authorized arms and ammunition,
was proposed Friday by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and a
bipartisan group of senators. It came in the wake of President
Reagan's decision to airlift more than 3,100 U.S. troops to
Honduras.
   Reagan dispatched the troops Wednesday after Nicaragua's leftist
government mounted an offensive against Contra rebels along the
Honduran border. In his Saturday radio address, Reagan blamed
Congress' recent rejection of new aid for the Contras for the
Sandinista push against the rebels.
   Asked if the administration objected to anything in the new
proposal, Fitzwater said, ``I would say overall that we are very
encouraged by the Kassebaum proposal ... but we want to be open to
other suggestions as well.''
   He said the administration would hold talks with House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, ``when the time is right.'' Discussions with
other members would continue today, he said, but he refused to name
the individuals.
   Asked if the administration believed there was a chance that
military aid for the rebels would be approved, the spokesman
declined to comment.
   The spokesman said the Sandinista push against the Contras had
``improved chances'' for such a package because it had changed
minds on Capitol Hill.
   ``Events of the last week have left little to the imagination in
terms of what President (Daniel) Ortega and the Sandinistas are
really up to,'' Fitzwater said.
   Secretary of State George Shultz, offering the administration's
first comment on the Contra aid proposal said Sunday that it
``should go forward.''
   Commenting on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' he said the package
was ``a little low on money'' but under study by the administration.
   Representatives from Capitol Hill differed today on whether the
situation had improved chances for renewed Contra aid.
   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,
said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' that the U.S. show of
strength had ``helped the situation.''
   Boren said he was ``amazed that there hasn't already been more
action'' in advancing the plan.
   However, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a senior member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee and an opponent of further military aid
to the Contras, said today that a favorable vote in the House is
much more problematic.
   ``The events of last week probably enhanced the possibility of
some kind of aid package moving forward,'' Hamilton said on the
same ABC-TV show. ``But there are a lot of obstacles to overcome.
It's very had to predict at this point.''
   But some in Congress say the administration, if it chooses to
back a new Contra aid request, must confront doubts about the
seriousness of the border clash and perhaps even a backlash in
Congress prompted by the sudden airlift of troops.
   ``There is ... a very serious lack of full trust here, which
goes back many years,'' said House Majority Leader Thomas Foley,
appearing on CNN's ``Newsmaker Sunday.''
   Reagan's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell,
denied Sunday that he had misled Congress when he briefed lawmakers
Wednesday. He acknowledged, however, that he had failed to mention
Reagan's decision in principle to send troops to Honduras if
President Jose Azcona requested them.
   ``We did not go into the specific options because we did not
want it all over the newspapers,'' Powell said during an appearance
on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   The national security adviser said the fighting on the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border was ``pretty much over'' and offered
assurances that it was unlikely U.S. troops would become involved.
   ``The combat zone is rapidly disappearing as the Sandinistas
appear to withdraw, and I don't think there is any reasonable
likelihood that they would be anywhere near the combat zone,''
Powell said of the U.S. troops.

George Oswald, treasurer of Techno Craft Inc., a 3-year-old,
privately held company.
   ``This business started with mobile homes, went to double-wides
and then two-story units. We said that's all well and good but
we're going to go ahead of that,'' said Greg Cunningham, the
company's founder and chief executive officer.
   Each two-story luxury home built by Techno Craft, which began
production last August, has hardwood floors, a spiral staircase,
chandeliers, a fireplace, jacuzzi, bidet and imported tiles.
Options include a steam room, sauna and an elevator.
   Cunningham, 35, started the Techno Craft in 1985 when another
company he heads had trouble finding an adequate supply of upscale
housing in the New York metropolitan area.
   ``This is really the answer to the housing problem in this
country, modular housing and done right,'' he said.
   Techno Craft produced 100 homes on its assembly line last year
and has orders this year for 450, he said.
   Oswald said the company will have to build another plant next
year to meet demand. He said they eventually want to make 1,000
homes a year for sale between Maine and Virginia and increase
employment from 125 to 700.
   Nationally, 51,000 modular homes were produced last year, up
from 39,000 in 1977, according to the 1988 edition of The Red Book
of Housing Manufacturers. Modular homes accounted for 2.8 percent
of the 1.85 million homes built in 1987, according to the book,
which based its findings on a survey of more than 500 companies.
   John J. Smolke Jr., chief of Pennsylvania's Division of
Manufactured Housing, a state regulatory agency, said a shortage of
skilled labor and greater profit for the builder have helped the
growth of the industry.
   But he said the industry still has to overcome the image that
pre-fabricated homes belong in the low-rent district.
   ``When people think of something built in a plant, they still
envision ... the typical mobile home,'' Smolke said.
   Cunningham said building homes in a factory has advantages to
building them on the lot.
   Homes built on site can take eight months to a year to build and
are subject to vandalism and theft, exposed to the weather and
dependent on local labor, he said.
   Techno Craft's factory-built mansions take eight weeks from the
start of construction to the day the homeowner can move in, and 95
percent of the work takes place in the factory, Cunningham said.
   Peter Cornell, president of Cornell Development Corp. in Albany,
N.Y., decided to have Techno Craft build 151 townhouses for a
development near Albany.
   ``They are the only people who can do in the factory what I can
with a real quality crew,'' Cornell said. He said Techno Craft will
do it at a lower cost.
   In the 480-foot-long Techno Craft plant, sections or modules of
a house are assembled along an assembly line with 24 work stations.
   Floors and roofs are constructed at separate stations to the
side of the assembly line and moved to the line by overhead cranes.
   The finished sections are shipped from the plant in central
Pennsylvania on six flatbed trucks and can be assembled in a day.
   After the sections are lifted onto a foundation with a crane and
assembled, siding is added and pre-cut molding and carpeting is
installed, Cunningham said.
   Oswald said modular homes from other builders require more
construction after they are placed on their foundations.
   ``It would take anybody else two or three years to get where we
are and by that time we'll be way ahead,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A leukemia patient learned today that his
bone marrow does not match that of his brother, a homeless Florida
man who had declined to undergo testing until he was offered $1,000.
   ``You kind of start counting on things and then you have a big
letdown,'' said Steven J. Chapman. ``I've just made up my mind not
to count on anything.''
   Doctors said they were presenting other treatment options to
Chapman, 31, of Oolitic.
   ``It's would have been a very rough treatment,'' said Dr.
Richard S. Fayssoux, the hematology and oncology specialist who is
treating Chapman.
   The patient's brother, Randy Chapman, 32, who was located last
month on the streets of Miami, initially refused to submit to tests.
   ``If he dies, he dies,'' said Randy Chapman, who earns his
living as the subject of medical experiments.
   Randy Chapman eventually accepted an Indiana philanthropist's
offer of a $1,000 testing incentive. The brother, who left home 16
years ago, would have received an additional $2,000 had there been
a match and subsequent transplant operation.
   Steven Chapman said doctors were checking into a partial bone
marrow match that was located through a national registry.
   ``We'll come up with something else,'' said Chapman.

<HEAD>Soviet Says Americans Dragging Their Feet on Nuclear Treaty</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs to UPDATE with Tass report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet official today charged that U.S.
negotiators are jeopardizing prospects of signing an accord to cut
long-range nuclear weapons at the next superpower summit.
   The remarks came in an interview of Alexei A. Obukhov, the
Soviets' top arms negotiator, published today in the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda. They coincided with the first day of talks
in Washington between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and U.S. officials.
   ``I have the impression that the Americans began to hesitate and
are not sure now whether it is worthwhile to have an agreement on
strategic offensive arms ready by the designated date, that is by
the time Ronald Reagan visits Moscow,'' Obukhov told Pravda.
``Today, the Americans are slowing down the pace rather than
increasing it.''
   Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz have
been holding monthly meetings to work out differences in a 200-page
treaty to cut long-range missiles by 50 percent.
   President Reagan has been expected to go to Moscow later this
spring, on a date to be announced, for his fourth meeting with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Both sides have said they would
like to sign the treaty on strategic weapons at that time.
   Shultz said in Moscow last February that the two sides had
agreed to tell treaty negotiators to draft verification and other
key elements by the time Shevardnadze came to the United States. He
also said negotiators should speed up progess in order to ensure a
treaty would be ready to sign at a Moscow summit.
   But Obukhov said Americans were dragging their feet with the
idea of turning lack of progress against the Soviets. ``Our
partners think that, with this kind of action, they can spoil the
term for working out the agreement and place the blame for this on
us,'' he said.
   Obukhov also said the Reagan administration's position on the
Strategic Defense Initiative, better known as ``Star Wars,'' still
stands in the way of an agreement. The Soviets say the program to
deploy a space shield against nuclear attack violates the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty between the superpowers.
   In a separate dispatch, the official Tass news agency said the
U.S. ``military-industrial complex'' has become wary of Star Wars
because the program's cost may preclude spending on other types of
military weapons.
   ``The prospect of enormous funds being allocated for SDI at the
expense of other military programs has caused obvious concern to
individual members of the military-industrial complex, who are
beginning to see the Star Wars project as two birds in the bush
that can make them lose the bird in hand,'' Tass said.
   Vladimir Chernyshov, the agency's military writer, said the
fifth anniversary of the Strategic Defense Initiative is being
widely celebrated in the United States although ``there is
effectively nothing left of the SDI `dream' as conceived five years
ago.''
   ``While then they were talking about an `impregnable shield,'
now they are talking about a `first phase' of an ABM system with
very limited capability,'' Chernyshov wrote.
   However, he said it would be a ``dangerous illusion' to believe
that because of opposition in Congress and elsewhere Star Wars will
soon be abandoned.

   More than 250,000 refugees of
drought and civil war from neighboring Sudan need more help to
control disease and starvation, the government-owned news agency
said Monday.
   The Sudanese refugees are aggravating an existing hunger problem
in Ethiopia, where 7 million people are threatened by starvation.
Most live in the northern provinces of Tigray and Eritrea, where
Ethiopia is fighting its own battle against secessionist rebels.
   An average of Sudanese 15 refugees died each day last month, but
the daily death toll recently had dropped to three, Ethiopian News
Agency said, quoting one of the country's Red Cross officials.
   The Red Cross is working among seven national and international
agencies providing food, clothing and medicine to the refugees.
   At least 47,000 of them flooded into Ethiopia's western border
regions of Illubabor and Wellega in the past four months. The
agency said the influx was increasing daily.
   Many of the refugees were fleeing a war started in 1983 by the
southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Army. The rebels are
fighting the Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum for economic
reforms and more autonomy in the mainly Christian and animist south.
   That war has also worsened chronic droughts.

<HEAD>Cabbies Arrested for Challenging Athens Anti-pollution Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested 34 taxi drivers Monday for
violating anti-pollution rules that ban half of the capital's
15,000 taxis from the city center each day.
   A spokesman for the cabbies said they intentionally entered the
district to challenge the ban, which they dismiss as illegal.
   The ban is part of a set of wide-ranging restrictions limiting
traffic in Athens. The measures are aimed at dispelling an
eye-stinging brown smog that hangs over the city in calm weather.
   The taxi drivers were arrested because they brought cabs with
even license-plate numbers into the 5-square-mile central zone on a
day reserved for odd-numbered vehicles, said a spokesmen for the
traffic police.
   Nikos Stekas, a spokesman for the Athens Taxi Drivers Union,
said cabbies will defy the ban every day, claiming it cuts their
income in half.
   The taxi drivers face a one-year jail term or a $370 fine,
police said. They could also lose their operating permits for a
month.

   State Rep. Bill English takes along a
portable television set and earplug when he goes to the House floor
to vote.
   Other lawmakers cluster around a lobby television set or around
TVs and radios in their offices, so focused on them that House
leaders sometimes need six quorum calls to transact business.
   The House is virtually at a standstill, with five members
working as the board of managers for the Senate's impeachment trial
of Gov. Evan Mecham and the 55 others fascinated by testimony that
has included an alleged death threat, sexual affairs, political
paybacks and the governor himself.
   The trial entered its fourth week Monday, and the Senate has
considered only one of three charges against Mecham, a first-term
Republican who is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six
decades and the first ever in Arizona.
   Many House committees canceled meetings last week for lack of
bills the chairmen wanted to consider, and the House moved to a
three-day week beginning Monday, down from four-day work weeks.
   The 30-member Senate, meanwhile, has scheduled night committee
meetings in an effort to act on the relatively few key areas
lawmakers want to address this session: the budget, taxes, air
pollution and indigent health care.
   Regular sessions are supposed to last 100 days, which generally
would mean ending in late April. But pressure to close does not
begin in earnest until per diem pay is cut in half after 110 days
and stops altogether after 120 days.
   Lawmakers say the pace has been especially slow this year,
despite promises from the House Republican leadership that things
would start moving once the House finished pre-impeachment hearings
and sent the matter to the Senate.
   ``It's not been a terribly productive year so far,'' says House
Minority Leader Art Hamilton, a Democrat from Phoenix.
   ``It's the most difficult session I've seen in 16 years, and it
doesn't seem to be getting any better,'' he added, citing ``a lot
more emotion than probably action.''
   Republican leaders acknowledge that impeaching a fellow
Republican has taken its toll on party unity. Hamilton and others
note the inaction on major bills and the concentration on issues
such as a resolution telling Congress that Soviet troops should
quit Angola.
   Other committee chairmen, meanwhile, have continued to limit
debate, prompting a series of walkouts by Democrats who complain
that important bills are not being given a full hearing.
   Republican leaders say they have been trying to keep the session
as normal as possible, but Hamilton said he thinks lawmakers should
take advantage of the spare time to look in-depth at issues such as
taxes, Arizona's Medicaid alternative and pollution, which normally
get resolved on a rush basis due to the press of other business.
   But because most House members are watching the trial, Hamilton
said, the House is doing little other its ``normal work at a much
slower pace.''
   It's tough to compete with the soap-opera draw of the
impeachment trial.
   Mecham is charged with ordering the Department of Public Safety
director not to cooperate with an investigation of the alleged
threat by a state official against a former Mecham aide. The aide
was about to testify before a state grand jury on the governor's
unreported $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham also is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing
the loan and misusing $80,000 in state funds by loaning the money
to his auto dealership.
   Mecham has said he will be exonerated.
   A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to convict Mecham,
and lawmakers also could bar him from public office. Mecham also
faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of concealing the
campaign loan, and a May 17 recall election.

   The State Department today complained of
massive Soviet arms shipments to Nicaragua as the war in the
Central American country cast a shadow over the visit of Foreign
Minsiter Eduard A. Shevardnadze even before he opened talks here.
   Charles E. Redman, the department spokesman, said the Soviets
shipped over 3,000 tons of equipment to the Sandinista government
in January and February alone.
   For a number of years, the Soviets have supplied Nicaragua with
$500 million to $600 million in assistance annually, he said. ``I
certainly don't see it as an issue heating up,'' Redman said. But,
he said Soviet military support is a ``continuing cause for
concern.''
   In another development before Shevardnadze opened talks with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz late in the day, the White
House confirmed that there could be two superpower summit meetings
this year.
   Signing a treaty to sharply reduce strategic nuclear weapons
this spring in Moscow ``is our goal,'' presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``We are hopeful, but there is no guarantee that we'll have a
START agreement ready to sign at the summit,'' he said.
   Therefore, Fitzwater said, Reagan told the International Herald
Tribune last Friday in an interview that ``if there was an
agreement later sure we'd find some way to sign it.''
   While the administration complained about Soviet military aid to
Nicaragua, Shevardnadze was bound to register Moscow's irritation
over the dispatch of 3,200 American troops to Honduras.
   ``We have quite a few problems,'' the Soviet foreign minister
said on his arrival Sunday for three days of talks with Shultz and
a session with President Reagan at the White House. He singled out
the situation in Central America as `'rather grave and of some
serious concern to us.''
   Also, an impasse has developed in negotiations, held in Geneva
under United Nations auspices, for the withdrawal of an estimated
120,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Still, the visit may produce a date for the next superpower
summit _ speculation centers on late May in Moscow _ and some
progress toward a treaty to sharply reduce U.S. and Soviet
long-range nuclear weapons.
   The treaty is the projected centerpiece for Reagan's fourth
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But negotiations
in Geneva have proceeded slowly.
   ``It's by no means in the bag,'' Shultz said Sunday of the
accord that would reduce by 30 percent to 50 percent the overall
arsenals of U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines.
   ``It's possible, but we're not going to try to have one just for
the sake of a treaty,'' Shultz said on NBC-TV. ``We'll only be
willing to go forward; the president will, if it's something we
regard as good.''
   Shevardnadze, in a statement on his arrival at Andrews Air Force
Base, outside Washington, said he was optimistic about arranging
Reagan's visit.
   ``I think we will be able to decide about the date,'' he said,
then added, ``We have to work hard; we have to work intently.''
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators have been working on drafts for the
strategic arms reduction treaty. One would deal with how nuclear
weapons will be scrapped, another with verifying compliance with
the accord.
   The two sides have exchanged drafts in the past month on how
they would inspect each other's missile sites and make sure
cutbacks are carried out. Shultz and Shevardnadze are also due to
review the procedures for reducing nuclear arsenals.
   The procedures are likely to follow the pattern of the treaty to
ban intermediate-range nuclear missiles. But verification is
considered a more difficult problem since not all the long-range
weapons would be scrapped.
   Shultz indicated strongly that Reagan would go to Moscow to see
Gorbachev _ with or without a treaty to sign.
   ``I think it is important that summit meetings have content,''
he said. ``But it's also true that we are now evolving into a
process where, perhaps, they will come to be a little more normal.
... There are plenty of things on our plate right now that could
come to fruition other than the strategic arms treaty.''
   Reagan, in an interview published in the International Herald
Tribune, said he was willing to meet with Gorbachev a second time
this year if the negotiations for a strategic arms treaty could not
be completed by the summit later this spring.
   Shevardnadze, after resting from his long flight from Moscow,
arranged for a late afternoon meeting with Shultz today. They will
meet again on Tuesday and Wednesday. His call on Reagan at the
White House tentatively is scheduled for Wednesday.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze have been meeting monthly to plan for
the summit. Improving the human rights situation in the Soviet
Union and soliciting Soviet support for an international arms
embargo against Iran also are among the U.S. goals.
   In the meantime, the wars in Nicaragua and Afghanistan
underscore U.S.-Soviet rivalries.
   Guerrillas in both countries are fighting with U.S. weapons
against Marxist governments equipped by the Soviet Union. The
Reagan administration last week turned the heat up in Central
America by sending troops to Honduras.

   A commuter train bound for Chicago hit a
truck and derailed today, injuring at least 16 people, one of them
seriously, officials said.
   The train derailed after hitting a truck at a crossroads just
west of New Lenox, said Will County police Sgt. Belt, who would not
provide his first name.
   Nancy Talaga, a witness, said the truck was stopped at a red
light, and when the light changed, the truck tried to cross the
tracks, which have warning signals and crossing gates.
   ``The train was right there,'' she said. ``I saw it in my
rear-view mirror hit the trailer and derail.''
   The truck went into a ditch and the driver came out of the cab,
she said. He was trying to walk away, but was unsteady and had
blood on his head.
   New Lenox Fire Chief Ken Hossack said the injured were taken to
Silver Cross Hospital in nearby Joliet. He said there were no
fatalities.
   Julie Grant, a spokeswoman at Silver Cross, said 16 people had
been brought in, with one in serious condition. The others were in
good condition and were expected to be released, she said.
   Ms. Grant said the man in serious condition, Terry Lewis, was
believed to be the truck driver.
   The accident occurred shortly after 10:30 a.m., officials said.
   Tracks were blocked in both directions, said Joyce MacDonald, a
spokeswoman for Metra, the commuter railroad.
   ``We have sent a train out from Chicago to pick up passengers
who want to continue their trip to Chicago,'' Ms. MacDonald said.

   Two Republican congressmen _ Dan Schaefer of Colorado and Howard
Nielson of Utah _ announced Monday they are running for re-election
to their fourth terms in office.
   Schaefer, 52, was first elected to Congress from Colorado's 6th
District to serve out the term of former astronaut Jack Swigert,
who was elected in 1982 but died before he could be seated.
   He said this might be his toughest contest if former state Sen.
Martha Ezzard, a former Republican turned Democrat, gets in the
race. She has expressed interest but has not formally announced.
   Nielson, 63, former Utah speaker of the House and one-time
statistics professor at Brigham Young University, won his last
election by a 2-1 margin.
   So far, one Democrat, unsuccessful 1984 U.S. Senate candidate
Craig Oliver, has announced he will challenge Nielson.

   A witness at Gov. Evan Mecham's
impeachment trial testified today that she was certain she told the
governor of an investigation into an alleged death threat two days
before he is accused of trying to hinder the probe.
   Peggy Griffith, director of the Governor's Office of Women's
Services, told the Senate, ``I believed at the time he understood
me.''
   Mecham is accused of trying to thwart an investigation of the
alleged threat, and he testified last week that he did not recall
Mrs. Griffith telling him there was a probe.
   Mrs. Grifith also said today that her secretary, Terri Fields,
complained that Mecham and his attorney were ``hounding'' her about
information on the alleged threat against another official.
   Mrs. Griffith quoted Ms. Fields as saying, ``They just keep
asking me about the conversation you had with Lee Watkins,'' who is
accused of making the alleged threat.
   Mecham is charged with ordering Department of Public Safety
Director Ralph Milstead not to cooperate with the attorney
general's investigation of the alleged threat by Watkins, then head
of state prison construction, against former top Mecham aide Donna
Carlson.
   It was Mrs. Griffith who reported the threat, and Ms. Fields
testified for the defense earlier in the trial in an effort to
discredit Mrs. Griffith's testimony. Ms. Fields said Mrs. Griffith
was sometimes forgetful and tended to exaggerate things.
   Defense attorney Fred Craft, who cross-examined Mrs. Griffith
today, asked if she had a ``total recall'' memory.
   ``When I hear a death threat I do,'' Mrs. Griffith said.
   She also said that during the first several days after the
alleged threat occurred, ``I felt very much like nobody believed
what I was saying.''
   At the time of the alleged Nov. 12 threat, Ms. Carlson was about
to testify before a state grand jury on the governor's unreported
$350,000 campaign loan.
   The governor's defense attorney, Fred Craft, also is expected to
be called to the stand before testimony is completed on the count
involving the death threat. Craft attended a crucial meeting at
which Mecham was told about the alleged threat.
   Mecham also is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing
the loan and misusing $80,000 in state funds by loaning the money
to his auto dealership. Opening arguments were expected this week
on the $80,000 loan.
   On Sunday, with his impeachment trial entering its fourth week
and some rocky testimony behind him, Mecham said he is still
convinced the Senate will exonerate him.
   ``With the world looking on as they have, I can't see how any of
them (senators) who have any claim of judging on the evidence can
do anything but exonerate me,'' Mecham said.
   Mecham spent part of three days on the stand last week, and
contended he was the victim of an attempted mutiny by people in
government, including Attorney General Bob Corbin and Milstead.
   But his effort to discredit the former head of his DPS security
detail, Lt. Beau Johnson, backfired Friday when Mecham admitted he
lacked proof _ as he earlier testified that he had _ that Johnson
had stolen an unrelated report on the agency from the governor's
office.
   Johnson had reported the alleged death threat to Mecham,
although the governor contends he was not adequately informed of
the seriousness of the matter.
   Mecham testified that Watkins told him he had been informed by
Johnson's supervisor, Lt. Col. James Chilcoat, that Johnson had
taken the report.
   However, Deputy DPS Director Lt. Col. Gary Phelps sparked
applause and laughter from the gallery when he testified moments
later that Watkins in fact had taken the report _ which Watkins
denied.
   Mecham said Sunday he thought he had ``not really'' been hurt by
his admission that he lacked the proof he had claimed under oath
that he had. And, he said he hadn't intended to make the claim
against Johnson.
   ``I inadvertently used it when they were asking for a lot of
things'' during his testimony, Mecham said.
   Mecham also said he believed Watkins ``was telling the truth
when he told me what Chilcoat told him.''
   The defense also sought last week to discredit Milstead with
testimony on his sex life by a woman who claimed to be his former
lover, Christina Johnston. She was not allowed to give specifics,
but said their relationship was ``intimate and personal'' and that
she had been married ``only six'' times.
   Mecham said he had never met Mrs. Johnston, but that he was told
by Craft that she was ``a very decent, honest person.''
   ``With the exception of Milstead, she marries men instead of
just lives with them,'' Mecham said. ``Women who are vulnerable get
taken advantage of by predatory men in this world.''
   Mecham is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades
and the first ever in Arizona.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict
Mecham, and lawmakers also could decide to bar him from future
public office.
   Mecham also faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of
concealing the $350,000 campaign loan, and a May 17 recall election.

   Five Army Pershing 2 missiles,
banned from deployment under a treaty with the Soviets, were
test-fired Monday.
   The unarmed missiles were successfully fired under battlefield
conditions by NATO troops, normally based in West Germany, an Army
spokesman said. The tests went off separately from 8:01 a.m. to
11:53 a.m., Army officials said.
   The Pershings have been banned from use under an arms treaty
signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, but the treaty has not been ratified by the Senate, a
move that could come in late spring.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, calls for
the destruction of all missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.
   Six of the Pershings were tested Feb. 15 at Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station, near the Kennedy Space Center, said Capt. Ken
Warren, an Air Force spokesman.
   The treaty does not require either side to withdraw or destroy
missiles until it has been ratified by both governments.
   The Pershing is a field missile _ each of which costs $4 million
_ launched from its own assembly that can be carried by a truck.

<HEAD>Blackmun Criticizes Denver Lawyer Over Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice Monday criticized a
Denver lawyer over the fees he is charging as the court's ``special
master'' in a case.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, dissenting from a court order
granting Charles J. Meyers $69,661.25 in interim fees, complained
about the hourly rates many large law firms charge their clients.
   Meyers, a former dean of Stanford Law School, is a partner in
the Denver office of the Los Angeles-based law firm of Gibson, Dunn
& Crutcher.
   Meyers in 1984 was appointed as special master in a
still-pending dispute between Texas and New Mexico over use of
Pecos River water.
   Texas is being allowed to ``sue'' New Mexico in the Supreme
Court before the case has been heard by any lower court. In such
cases, the justices invoke the court's ``original jurisdiction''
and hire a special master to conduct hearings and make
recommendations.
   The case, in varying forms, has been before the high court since
1975.
   Meyers' submitted bill of over $69,000 represents work he and an
associate of his law firm, Diana Poole, have devoted to the case
since late 1986.
   Meyers' bill, to be paid by Texas and New Mexico, reflects
compensation averaging $275.12 an hour for himself and $191.30 for
Ms. Poole.
   In his dissenting opinion, Blackmun notes that many of the 246
hours Ms. Poole spent working on the case represented getting
herself familiar with the legal issues. Another associate in
Meyers' law firm, Steven Crafton, had been assigned similar duties
before leaving the firm's Denver office.
   ``It seems apparent _ indeed (Meyers) so concedes when he
describes the nature of the `early months' of her work on the case
_ that a substantial amount of Ms. Poole's time was self-education
... and was duplicative background work already performed by ...
Crafton,'' Blackmun said.
   ``The consequences of Crafton's departure hardly are to be
charged to these litigants,'' Blackmun added.
   He added: ``It also is difficult for me to accept the fact that
in Denver, Colo., this partner's time is now worth $290 an hour,
having been increased from $265 on Nov. 1, 1987, and that the time
of Ms. Poole is now worth $200 an hour, having been elevated from
$170 beginning Nov. 1, 1987.
   ``It seems to me that `establishment' law firms are doing
themselves and the public a disservice by asserting fees of this
magnitude so persistently over dissents from the court.
   ``Public dissatisfaction with lawyers is not unknown; neither is
public distrust of lawyers. A fee application of this kind tends to
build that dissatisfaction and that distrust,'' Blackmun said.
   The case is Texas vs. New Mexico, 65 Original.

<HEAD>Improved Child-Resistant Closures Previewed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety experts previewed a series of new
designs for child-resistant pill containers Monday to highlight
this year's National Poison Prevention Week.
   The special medicine containers have helped reduce the number of
children fatally poisoned from nearly 500 in 1962 to 56 in 1985,
reported Terrence M. Scanlon, chairman of the federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
   Marsha Millonig of the National Poison Prevention Week said
resistant caps are one of the three main factors in reducing
poisonings, along with the growth of poison control centers and
improved parental awareness of the dangers of poison for children.
   And Dr. Toby Litovitz of the National Capital Poison Control
Center at Georgetowen University Hospital stressed that even with
the reduction in poisonings, the danger to toddlers persists and
merits continued vigilance.
   While the special caps on medicine bottles and other products
have helped reduce the toll on children, Scanlon conceded that many
adults also have trouble with them.
   Hugh Lockhart of Michigan State University described several
possible design changes that have been developed.
   The currently popular design, in which the cap from a pill
bottle must be pressed down and turned to get it open, requires
some strength and determination, he noted.
   Basically, people are required to ``engage a series of lugs that
they cannot see, using a principle that they do not understand.
It's no wonder they've had trouble,'' Lockhart said.
   One of the findings of the university researchers is that the
physical strength of very old people may be no greater than than of
a small child, he said. But the elderly generally retain manual
dexterity and can handle problem solving better, so those abilities
were considered in designing new closures.
   Among the closures being tested, he said, are:
   _Placing individual pills in a strong plastic blister, with a
peel-off backing.
   _Designing a rigid plastic package with pills in individual
blisters. The package would fold in half with a child-resistant
latch holding it closed.
   _Bottle caps similar to the current ones, except with a slot
that a key could be slid into to allow them to be turned to open.
   _Another bottle cap with a hole in the side into which a pencil
or other tool could be inserted to twist it open.
   _A somewhat easier to open version of the current caps, which is
lifted to open rather than being pressed down.
   _Using inks in contrasting colors to make the directions and
arrows stand out on caps, expecially those on which arrows have to
be lined up to get them open.
   Safety Commission Vice Chairwoman Carol Dawson said the agency
is arranging for test samples of the various designs to be made,
and expects to give them tryouts during the next year.
   Designs that are successful would be made available for
manufacturers to copy at no charge, she said.
   Some of the designs could be more costly than current
child-resistant caps, although Lockhard declined to speculate on
the amount of the cost.
   The Closure Manufacturers Association, meanwhile, applauded the
research effort and said its members are anxious to participate in
the testing of the new designs.

   A gunman in a black helmet shot dead the driver
of a stretch limousine parked on a Greenwich Village street Monday,
then roared away on a motorcycle into rush-hour traffic, police
said.
   ``The indications we see here are symptomatic of a mob hit,''
Assistant Police Chief Aaron Rosenthal said at the scene.
   ``Obviously, they knew who they were shooting at. They were very
cool about it and very gutsy,'' he said. ``I would characterize it
as cool, gutsy and professional and deliberate.''
   Rosenthal said he had little information on the victim,
limousine owner-driver Gregory DeCurtis, 29, who lived across the
street from the shooting scene.
   His cream-colored Cadillac was parked outside a cafe when two
men, both wearing black helmets, sped up on a red and white
motorcycle at 8:20 a.m., police said.
   One man dismounted and fired five shots into the closed driver's
window, striking DeCurtis three times in the arm and once in the
back, police said. The man then got back on the bike and fled.
   A passenger in the front seat, a man in his late 20s, was
unhurt; his name was not released, said Officer Hugh Barry.

   Police moved in on a crowd of more than 500
people demonstrating today against U.S. military presence in
Central America, arresting an estimated 225 protesters who tried to
block the entrance to the Federal Building.
   Baton-wielding officers began rounding up demonstrators after
police Capt. William Welch warned the crowd they were gathered
illegally and ordered them to disperse.
   Demonstrators hurled newspaper vending boxes and other debris
into the street, trying to disrupt traffic and stay one step ahead
of helmeted police.
   Shouts of ``No Contra aid'' and ``U.S., CIA, out of Nicaragua,''
filled the air as the demonstrators circled in front of the closed
main entrance while early arrivals for work got in through another
door.
   But the crowd quickly moved to that entrance, holding aloft a
6-foot-long sign reading, ``This building closed for renovation of
morals.''
   Some demonstrators tried disrupting traffic, wandering in the
path of cars and forcing them to swerve or stop. In one instance, a
demonstrator fled, leaving behind a small yellow scooter, which an
officer picked up and hurled into the gutter.
   Most of those arrested were cited for taking part in an illegal
assembly.
   ``We're not going to stop these protests because we want people
to know we are seriously committed to stopping U.S. intervention in
Central America,'' said Bill Nygren, a spokesman for Pledge of
Resistance, one of several groups sponsoring the demonstrations.
   On Friday, about 250 people were arrested when they encircled
the building and tried to stop 5,000 federal workers from entering.
   Today's effort follows a protest through city streets Saturday
night by at least 5,000 people, where _ at one point _ several
hundred protesters battled police for 25 minutes after a fire was
lighted in the street.
   Since Thursday, 278 people have been arrested during troop
deployment protests in San Francisco. Most of those arrested were
cited for failure to disperse at an unlawful assembly, said Sgt.
Dave Ambrose.
   Last Wednesday, Reagan ordered 3,200 troops, 1,100 of them Fort
Ord near Monterey, into Honduras to counter the reported presence
of Nicaraguan soldiers in that country.

<TEXT>
   An explosion ripped through a four-story
apartment building in Moslem west Beirut on Monday night, killing
one man and injuring four others, police said.
   Investigators were trying to determine the cause of the 7 p.m.
blast in the low-income, predominantly Sunni Moslem district of
Tarik Jedideh.
   ``Some surviving tenants claim it was a gas cylinder explosion
and others say it was a small bomb that went off on the
staircase,'' a police captain said
   The explosion wrecked the northern front of the building, but
all four apartments remained intact.
   The dead man was identified as Mohammed Kurdi, 85, the
landlord's father.
   His grandson, also named Mohammed Kurdi, shouted: ``It's him!
It's my grandfather!'' when civil defense rescuers found the body
in the debris.
   Rescuers rushed to the scene after the explosion. All the
tenants had been accounted for.
   In Tripoli, 50 miles north of Beirut, an unfinished eight-story
building collapsed at daybreak, burying six construction workers,
police said.
   One man was rescued after six hours. Although rescue teams
reported hearing moans beneath the wreckage, hopes were fading at
nightfall that any of the other five would be found alive.
   It was not known why the building collapsed.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Okays Some Diesel Fuel Sales Without Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee, flooded by
complaints from farmers, fishermen and mining companies, voted
Monday to allow some sales of diesel fuel without the payment of
tax.
   The relief would be financed by doubling the tax on gas-guzzling
cars and closing a loophole that has allowed a handful of
distilleries to dodge part of the liquor tax by watering down some
of their booze.
   Because of the drive to reduce the budget deficit, farmers and
others who buy diesel for off-road use may not get their relief
until Oct. 1. Unless some bookkeeping trick can be found quickly,
they will have to pay the 15.1-cent-a-gallon tax and then apply for
a refund when they file their income tax returns next year.
   But the prospect of delivering that message to farmers is not a
happy one for lawmakers.
   ``When we go back for recess (Easter week), it will be about
(tax-return) filing time and it would be like us walking through a
field of scorpions barefooted'' to have to tell farmers they face
all that paperwork for another six months, said Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark.
   ``With the creativity of the minds around here, perhaps we can
come up with'' a solution that will make the relief available on
April 1, said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the committee chairman.
   The committee is restrained by an agreement between Congress and
the Reagan administration which requires that each dollar of tax
relief be offset by a dollar of tax increase.
   As part of the deficit-reduction law passed last December,
farmers and other off-the-road diesel users are required to pay the
tax, beginning April 1, and then apply for a refund. Congress found
there had been a considerable amount of evasion because of the
difficulty in policing so many retail outlets. The new law requires
the tax be collected by wholesalers or producers.
   Farmers accused the government of trying to balance the budget
on their backs, contending there is no reason that Washington
should have interest-free use of their money _ an average of about
$320 per farmer per year _ for as much as 12 months. Similar
complaints have come from timber companies, mine operators,
fishermen and oil drillers.
   The Finance Committee put together this package, which is
subject to approval in the Senate and House:
   _To allow all diesel bought for any off-road use from
wholesalers to escape the tax altogether. Tax-exempt buyers of
off-road diesel from retailers would have to pay the tax and get a
refund next year. This would cost the government $543 million
through 1993.
   _To approve a ``taxpayer bill of rights,'' which would clamp
down on what are perceived to be abuses of taxpayers by the
Internal Revenue Service. This would lose $517 million over five
years, due chiefly to a drop in compliance.
   _To extend through June 30, 1989, the expiring authority for the
IRS to withhold tax refunds from people who owe student loans, farm
loans and other federal debts. This would raise about $400 million.
   _To double the tax on new cars whose fuel efficiency does not
meet federal standards, raising $375 million through 1993. In the
current model year, the tax hits only expensive foreign cars, such
as the $138,850 Lamborghini Countach, which gets 8.8 miles per
gallon and is subject to a $3,850 levy, and the BMW 750, which gets
16.4 mpg and faces a $1,500 gas-guzzler tax. Those taxes would rise
to $7,700 and $3,000 respectively.
   _To limit use of a ``wine flavors credit'' under which some
manufacturers of distilled spirits avoid a significant share of the
$12.50-a-gallon liquor tax by mixing some products with a
grape-based alcohol. This is expected to raise $360 million over
five years.
   The committee's bill does nothing about a 1986 law, also aimed
at tax evaders, that requires about 82,000 state, city and county
government units to pay taxes of 9.1 cents a gallon on their
gasoline and apply later for a refund. That provision took effect
Jan. 1.

<HEAD>Too Many Tests Done to Predict Cancer Hazard, Experts Say

   Government regulators around the
world require too many long and costly tests to determine whether
new synthetic chemicals are cancer hazards, two experts said Monday.
   A few relatively quick tests can identify the class of chemicals
that form the greatest hazard, and new tests may have to be devised
for the rest, they said at a science writers seminar sponsored by
the American Cancer Society.
   ``Nobody knows how to register a chemical that's safe around the
world'' because so many tests are required, including those that do
not really tell how hazardous a chemical would be for humans, said
John Ashby of the Central Toxicology Laboratory of ICI Ltd., a
chemical company in Chesire, England.
   A limited number of short-term tests will correctly identify
chemicals that can cause genetic mutations, which have the highest
chance of causing cancer in humans, he said.
   One major test, called the Ames test, looks for genetic changes
in bacteria called salmonella. Another compares the molecular
structure of a new chemical to those that have proven
cancer-causing in the past, he said.
   Such tests will overlook chemicals that cause cancer without
damaging genes, and which apparently affect the natural mutation
rate of genes, he said. New tests in animals will probably be
needed to find those, he said.
   Currently, some regulators require high-dose tests in mice and
rats that run two or three years, and chemicals are labeled
cancer-causing even if they cause only specific tumors in
particular sexes of rodents, he said.
   No chemical with such limited effects has been shown to cause
cancer in people, he said. Such chemicals are far less likely to
cause cancer in humans exposed to low dose levels than one shown to
damage genes and cause cancer in a range of tissues in several
rodent species, he said.
   Saccharin is one example of a chemical with only limited effect
in animals that should not be considered a carcinogen for people,
he said.
   Vincent DeVita, head of the National Cancer Institute, said he
thought the labeling of saccharin as a carcinogen was
``overblown,'' making for confusing comparisons with such cancer
dangers as cigarette smoke.
   The theme of excessive testing was echoed by the second expert
on chemicals, Michael Shelby of the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences.
   He said that of 23 chemicals or chemical combinations on a
standard list of cancer hazards, 20 score positive on the Ames test
or another short-term test that checks for genetic damage in bone
marrow of rodents.
   Another would probably score positive, he said. The remaining
two are asbestos fibers and a form of estrogen. So when new
substances that resemble either of those come up for testing, they
should get special consideration, he said.

<HEAD>Defense in Nazi War Crimes Trial Argues for Mistaken Identity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least six guards at a Nazi death camp
resembled a retired Ohio autoworker accused of war crimes who
claims he is a victim of mistaken identity, his lawyer said Monday
at a special evidentiary session.
   John Demjanjuk's attorney said the new evidence casts doubt on
the testimony of five survivors of the camp who identified his
client as a guard known as ``Ivan the Terrible.''
   Attorney Yoram Sheftel was speaking to a special session of a
three-judge panel at Demjanjuk's trial in Jerusalem. The year-long
trial ended Feb. 16, and judges were considering a verdict when
they agreed to permit the defense to offer the new documents
submitted last week.
   Sheftel also argued that part of the evidence used to bring
Demjanjuk to trial was forged and thus throws the prosecution's
case into question. He said the 1979 testimony of a Soviet citizen,
who said Demjanjuk was a guard at the Sobibor death camp, was
concocted to frame his client.
   ``You cannot by any stretch of the imagination be in two places
at one time, in both Treblinka and Sobibor,'' Sheftel said.
   Demjanjuk, 67, is charged with operating the gas chambers that
killed 850,000 Jews at Treblinka in Nazi-occupied Poland in 1942
and 1943.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, who settled in the Cleveland area
after World War II, says he was set up by the Soviet Union. He says
the Soviets wanted to hurt him because he had fought in an
anti-communist army unit organized by the Germans during World War
II.
   The new evidence for his defense includes 12 statements from
Treblinka inmates who failed to identify Demjanjuk as Ivan from two
photographs of the autoworker in an eight-picture lineup. Three
others pointed to the two pictures, but identified them as six
different Nazi guards, Sheftel said.
   Sheftel said the 1979 statement came from a Soviet citizen named
I.T. Danilchenko. He said the document was contrived to lend
credence to a key piece of prosecution evidence, Demjanjuk's
purported Nazi ID card provided by the Soviet Union to Israel.
   ``I don't know whether Danilchenko is alive or whether there
even is such a person,'' Sheftel said.
   The prosecutor dismissed the defense's claims. ``I fail to see
how any of this helps the defense,'' said prosecutor Michael
Shaked. ``All this proves to the court is that there were quite a
number of survivors who pointed to Demjanjuk's picture as being
familiar to them.''
   He said the importance of the Soviet citizen's statement was nil.
   Demjanjuk sat impassively during the eight-hour session,
occasionally yawning.
   A federal judge in Washington ordered the U.S. Justice
Department to release the new evidence last month after the
Demjanjuk family filed a request under the Freedom of Information
Act.

<HEAD>Magistrate Denies Inmate's Claim for Satanism Materials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal magistrate denied a prisoner's
request for materials to worship Satan, ruling that Satanism is not
a religion and the knitting needles he wanted for bloodletting
would pose a security risk.
   Holman Prison inmate Charles McCorkle had filed a lawsuit
against state officials, claiming he was prevented from practicing
Satanism at the maximum-security prison.
   Besides asking for the Satanic bible and other books on the
occult, McCorkle asked for knitting needles to draw blood for his
rituals.
   U.S. Magistrate William Cassady ruled earlier this month that
``Satanism is an unreligion,'' instead of a religion.
   ``It is a philosophy of life that rejects all religions and
promotes the idea that man should not be subservient to any natural
or supernatural being,'' Cassady ruled.
   If McCorkle's requests were granted, the magistrate ruled, he
would ``create a severe security risk to prison officials and other
inmates.''
   McCorkle's suit earlier was dismissed as frivolous, but the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ordered a hearing on the
claim, which prompted Cassady's review.
   In his 11-page recommendation, the magistrate said McCorkle has
a history of psychiatric disorders, has attempted suicide by
slashing his wrists and has admitted to a previous addiction to
numerous drugs, including heroin.
   Assistant Attorney General David Christy, who defended the
prison system, applauded Cassady's decision.
   ``This is the first time I've seen where a judge held
unequivocably (Satanism) is not a religion,'' Christy said.
   McCorkle is serving a 40-year sentence on three separate
burglary convictions. He claimed if he had the proper reading
materials and articles needed for his rituals, he could practice
magic and gain mental and physical prowess over others, including
prison officials, and could ``curse others even to the point of
death.''

<HEAD>US Calls Salvadoran Elections a Victory for Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Monday hailed El
Salvador's national elections, calling them a strong victory for
the democratic process in that country.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman said some experienced
observers described Sunday's balloting as being the most well run
and secure of the five elections held in El Salvador since
democracy was restored in 1982.
   ``There was virtually no evidence of election fraud or
pre-election violence by any of the contending parties,'' Redman
said.
   ``The strong turnout, apparently around 70 percent, in the face
of a concerted guerrilla campaign of terrorism and intimidation
should make it clear that the vast majority of the Salvadoran
people reject the revolutionary violence and rhetoric of the
communist guerrillas,'' he said.
   The election produced sizable gains by a rightist party, one of
whose leaders, Roberto D'Aubuisson, has been denied a U.S. visa
from time to time because of his alleged association with death
squad groups.
   Redman was asked whether the United States had any reservations
about the outcome of the elections.
   ``Our basic policy is that we don't choose sides in these kinds
of elections,'' Redman said. ``The U.S. government is committed to
the support and the consolidation of democratic government in El
Salvador, no matter which party wins power through free and fair
elections.''

   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said
Nicaraguan troops are retreating from Honduran territory and the
3,200 U.S. soldiers on an emergency mission in Honduras probably
won't be needed much longer.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
all or almost all the Nicaraguan forces have returned to their
homeland.
   Nicaragua, which announced today it was suspending military
operations against the U.S.-backed Contra rebels during cease-fire
talks, has denied Sandinista forces entered Honduras in pursuit of
the Contras.
   Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega, leader of the Nicaraguan
delegation in the cease-fire talks, also urged the Contras to halt
their military activities during the three days of discussions.
   Bosco Matamoros, spokesman for the Contra delegation, later
announced a suspension of the Contras' offensive military
operations in Nicaragua as an ``expression of our good will.''
   Redman told reporters in Washington all or nearly all the
Nicaraguans had left Honduras and there has been a substantial
Sandinista deployment on the Nicaraguan side of the border.
   ``I don't have any way to confirm that it's a 100 per cent
withdrawal but I think the evidence is that it has been a general
withdrawal back across the river,'' he said.
   Asked whether the American ground forces sent to Honduras last
week can be withdrawn, Redman said it was difficult to know what
the Sandinistas will do next.
   ``One can hope that they've learned a lesson this time,'' he
said.
   On Saturday, Honduras launched an air raid aimed at driving out
about 600 Sandinistas that officials said were leaving Honduras too
slowly. The government said two U.S.-made F-5 fighter jets fired
rockets at the Sandinista troops.
   Honduras said the air raid was eight miles inside its borders,
but Nicaragua said it was five miles within its territory.
   Nicaragua formally protested the air raid as an unwarranted act
of aggression. It said the Honduran planes dropped bombs in the
Bocay area of Nicaragua, 170 miles northeast of Managua.
   ``Things are getting back to normal,'' Azcona said Sunday. ``If
there are no more incidents, the American will leave,'' He did not
say when the U.S. troops, which began arriving Thursday, would
depart nor did he further describe the Sandinista withdrawal.
   A high-ranking Honduran military official said Sunday that
Honduras planned to position troops all along the 500-mile-long
border with Nicaragua to guard against future incursions.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not say
when the troops would be in place or if this would be a permanent
operation.
   President Reagan ordered the U.S. troops in after he and
Honduras said 2,000 Sandinistas had crossed the border.
   Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., a member of a congressional
delegation that ended a fact-finding mission to Honduras on Sunday,
said he expects the U.S. military personnel to pull out in about a
week.
   ``I think it'll all be over by then,'' Montgomery, a member of
the House Armed Services Committee, said at a news conference at
Palmerola, headquarters for the American military operation in
Honduras.
   The U.S. national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, also
said the fighting was essentially over. Appearing on ABC-TV's
``This Week With David Brinkley,'' Powell said the troops will
return to the United States soon.
   Peace talks between Contra rebel leaders and officials of the
Sandinista government began today in the southern border post of
Sapoa, Nicaragua, 90 miles south of Managua near the Costa Rican
border.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, deputy foreign minister in Nicaragua, said
the talks will center on finding a way for the Contras to lay down
their arms. The Contras say the talks should include political
issues.
   The new $48 million proposal for U.S. aid to the Contras would
include delivery of up to $2.5 million in previously authorized
military assistance.
   On Sunday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in
Washington that the package should go forward, although he said it
was ``a little low on money.''
   But some in Congress say the Reagan administration, if it
chooses to back a new Contra aid request, must confront doubts
about the seriousness of the border clash.
   ``There is ... a very serious lack of full trust here,'' said
House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   Foley said he hoped the latest round of fighting has not
destroyed chances for progress in the Nicaraguan peace talks.

   Public high school students are talking
with AIDS victims as part of a program to learn about the deadly
disease.
   ``The strangest thing about living with this illness is that I
don't know what the future is for me,'' Jim Slemmons recently told
students at Lincoln High School. ``I just go day to day. That's one
reason I'm here today. You guys have a bright future. You need to
make sure it stays that way.''
   Michele Crouch, 17, took the advice to heart.
   ``Just because he has AIDS, you can talk to him and be in the
same room, and you won't get it,'' she said. ``I also learned you
have to protect yourself. If you don't know where someone's been,
you don't want to be with them.''
   The discussion was part of a program of four sessions for
10th-graders. Participation requires parental approval.
   The first part, led by a medical student, teaches facts about
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The second looks at students'
fears about the disease and those who have it; the third features
one of 18 trained people with AIDS talking with students; and the
fourth is a discussion of that visit.
   Christian Haren _ an ex-model, eighth-grade dropout and AIDS
victim _ said he encountered resistance to the program from school
officials worried about parental opposition.
   But he said Superintendent Ramon Cortines approved the idelopments
Sunday and today involving
Nicaragua, Honduras, the United States and El Salvador:

   American soldiers engaged in military maneuvers Sunday at a
Honduran airstrip just 20 miles from the Nicaraguan border, but
U.S. officials said the threat from Sandinista troops had subsided
and combat appeared unlikely.
   President Reagan sent 3,200 U.S. military personnel to
non-combat areas in Honduras last week after the Central American
nation reported that Nicaraguan forces had crossed its border to
raid bases of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels.
   Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the U.S. national security adviser, said
in Washington the U.S. military exercises should be completed
shortly and the troops will return to the United States.
   The Reagan administration indicated support for a new $48
million proposal for aid to the Contras that was advanced by a
bipartisan group of senators.

   Both sides announced they would suspend offensive military

   On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco reiterated
a previous Sandinista position that the negotiations strictly deal
with the mechanics of a cease-fire. Rebel leaders said the talks
must also focus on ``democratization of Nicaragua and free
elections.''
   Earlier, Nicaragua formally protested a Honduran bombing raid on
Sandinista positions Saturday as an unwarranted act of aggression.
It has denied that its troops crossed the jungle-choked border
dividing the nations.

<HEAD>Court To Decide if Abused Kids May Sue Public Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide
whether abused children may sue public officials for failing to
protect them from their parents.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal on behalf of a
Wisconsin boy who suffered serious and permanent brain damage from
beatings by his father. Social workers and officials are accused of
gross negligence in ignoring evidence the boy was being brutally
victimized.
   The court's study of the case, expected to yield a ruling
sometime in 1989, comes amid growing concern nationwide over child
abuse.
   In other actions, the court:
   _Left intact a ruling that forces school officials in New Mexico
to defend themselves at trial against allegations they violated a
young girl's constitutional rights by paddling her.
   _Left intact a federal law requiring broadcasters to give equal
time to opposing candidates for public office.
   _Agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed to
promote competitive bidding on government contracts. At issue is
the proper boundary between presidential and congressional power.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Texas whether states may impose
sales taxes on most books, newspapers and magazines while exempting
religious publications.
   _Refused to let states and local governments regulate the prices
most of the nation's cable television operators charge for basic
service.
   In the child-abuse case, the court will consider reinstating a
suit against the Winnebago County, Wis., Department of Social
Services and two of its employees.
   The agency was accused of violating the rights of Joshua
DeShaney because it failed to rescue him from his father's
beatings. The department was charged with knowing about the
beatings since 1983 when Joshua was four.
   He has been institutionalized since 1984, suffering from
injuries that destroyed half his brain and left him profoundly
retarded.
   The boy's father, Randy DeShaney, since has been convicted of
child abuse and sentenced to two years to four years in prison.
   A social worker, Ann Kemmeter, was assigned to the DeShaney case
in 1983 after Joshua was brought to a hospital with various cuts
and bruises.
   Ms. Kemmeter visited the DeShaney home several times but
allegedly failed to take any steps to remove him from the home or
protect him.
   DeShaney's ex-wife, Melody, sued the social services officials
on grounds they violated the child's constitutional right not to be
deprived of liberty without due process.
   Mrs. DeShaney was divorced from her husband and living in
Cheyenne, Wyo., when she was informed her son had suffered serious
brain damage. DeShaney had custody of his son.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Mrs. DeShaney's
suit. The appeals court said the social welfare agency and its
employees ``though blameworthy, did not cause Joshua's injuries.''
The appeals court said Ms. Kemmeter ``merely failed to protect him
from his bestial father.''
   The appeals court also said welfare agencies should not be
placed in the predicament of removing a child from home and facing
suit by the parent or leaving the child there and risk being sued
by the child.
   Putting officials in that position ``is unlikely to improve the
welfare of American families and is not grounded in constitutional
text or principle,'' the appeals court said.
   In other developments, the court:
   _Agreed in a case from Pennsylvania to consider shielding states
from having to help pay for cleaning up hazardous waste sites when
the federal government sues businesses under the ``Superfund'' law.
   _Refused to hold Hustler magazine financially liable for the
death of a 14-year old Texas boy who died during a sexual
experiment that was the subject of an article in the magazine.
   _Refused to allow the manufacturer of the Dalkon Shield to set
up a $15 million emergency fund to help women who say the
contraceptive device left them infertile.
   _Refused to give a Pasadena, Calif., shopping mall owner more
power to restrict such activities as distribution of leaflets and
solicitation of signatures for petitions.
   _Refused to kill a 13-year-old lawsuit against former federal
and military officials stemming from an armed confrontation between
Indians and federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973.

<HEAD>Blacks Hold National Protest Despite Ban On Major Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of
blacks on Monday defied emergency regulations and joined a national
protest strike commemorating the 28th anniversary of the
Sharpeville massacre.
   The strike occurred despite a ban on major opposition groups
that usually coordinate such action.
   The demonstration was widespread in the Johannesburg-Pretoria
area, in Durban and around the eastern Cape province city of Port
Elizabeth. But there was no specific call for a strike in the Cape
Town area, and major mining companies reported little or no
disruption of their operations.
   Police estimated 40 percent of the black work force around
Johannesburg stayed away from their jobs. Labor experts say there
are about 800,000 full-time black workers in the area.
   A South African court, meanwhile, denied an appeal by one of the
country's most outspoken anti-apartheid newspapers, clearing the
way for the government to shut it down.
   Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha had intended to close the
New Nation in January, but delayed the move while the newspaper
sought temporary protection from government action.
   After the court denied such protection Monday, Botha's office
declined to reveal when it would shut the periodical.
   After the court decision Monday, the New Nation's acting editor,
Gabu Tugwana, said ``We are pretending we don't face any
suspension. If the deadline (for the Thursday) edition comes and we
are printed, good luck to us.''
   Monday's protest commemorated the death of 69 black people
killed in 1960 when police fired on thousands of demonstrators
protesting South Africa's pass laws.
   The laws restricting blacks' freedom of movement were repealed
in 1986.
   In Sharpeville, the scene of the massacre, residents placed
flowers on the victims' graves.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, attended one of the services in the township south
of Johannesburg.
   Several hundred black youths jogged alongside Mrs. Mandela's
van, chanting freedom songs.
   In Durban, police in a helicopter fired tear gas to disperse
boycotting students who rampaged through the campus at the
predominantly-Indian University of Durban-Westville. The boycotters
chased students out of classes, then assaulted them when they
sought refuge in the library.
   Police reported two unrest-related killings of blacks overnight,
one near Durban and one in Soweto, but gave no indication whether
they were linked to the protest.
   Four buses were fire-bombed in Durban on Monday and service to
black townships was cancelled when drivers refused to work.
   The United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, had coordinated previous nationwide
protests during the 21-month-old state of emergency.
   But last month, it was banned, along with 16 other
organizations, from participating in any activity not approved by
the government.
   Several affiliates of the front took out newspaper
advertisements announcing Monday's ``national day of protest.'' And
anonymous pamphlets calling for school and work boycotts appeared
on doorsteps in the black townships.
   It is illegal under emergency regulations to call for boycotts
of anykind.
   Police had said they would ensure the safety of blacks who
wanted to go to work, but they reported no intimidation in Soweto,
the township of 2.5 million blacks outside Johannesburg.
   Schools and shops were closed and there were virtually no
passengers in commuter buses or taxi-vans.
   One of the largest stayaways, more than 90 percent of black
workers, occurred near the Eastern Cape city of Uitenhage, where
police shot dead 21 blacks during a funeral procession on
Sharpeville Day in 1985.
   The Port Elizabeth Evening Post, after carrying reports of the
strike in its early editions, received a telephone call from a
police officer who noted that emergency regulations prohibit news
reports about the impact of illegal strikes.
   The newspaper dropped the strike stories from its late edition,
but there were no reports of similar warnings being issued to other
media.

<HEAD>Soviets to Visit Oak Park for Look At America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moscow will meet middle America when four Soviets
are invited into the homes a suburban police chief and other local
hosts next month.
   Virginia Cassin, village clerk of west suburban Oak Park and one
of the hosts, says the visit will give people in her town a rare
chance to promote world peace.
   ``Good personal relationships are a beginning,'' said Mrs.
Cassin, who recently visited the Soviet Union. ``You have to start
small.''
   The visitors will be among 400 Soviets touring 240 cities in the
United States this year under a program called ``Soviets, Meet
Middle America,'' sponsored by the San Francisco-based Center for
U.S.-U.S.S.R. Initiatives.
   The visitors to Oak Park, a community of 62,000 people, include
two from Moscow and two from the state of Georgia. They will get a
good taste of the United States in Oak Park, said Police Chief
William Kohnke.
   ``We're a very diverse community,'' he said Sunday in a
telephone interview. ``We've got Frank Lloyd Wright, a
working-class of people, professionals, and it's close to the city
(of Chicago).''
   Several homes built by Wright, the late architect, are in Oak
Park.
   Oak Park has a reputation for racial diversity, but it made
headlines recently when a quasi-governmental agency effectively
blocked a bid by a predominantly black church to buy a building in
an Oak Park shopping district.
   Kohnke said that episode, which generated strong local comment
against racism, illustrates the American system of political
dialogue.
   ``It shows that people speak out, people aren't afraid to
criticize,'' he said.
   Leonid Manov, 30, who is from the Institute of Law in Moscow,
will stay with Kohnke during the 4{-day visit beginning April 9.
The chief said he has visited the Soviet Union, and corresponds
frequently with some Soviets in police work.
   Irina Malikova, 34, identified as a ``politologist'' from
Moscow, will stay with Mrs. Cassin.
   Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, 40, of Tblisi, executive secretary of
the Georgian Peace Committee; and Ilyia Chkeheidze, 21, a student
at Tblisi Academy of Arts, will be guests of owners of a bed and
breakfast.
   The Center for U.S.-U.S.S.R. Initiatives is a non-profit,
organization dedicated to reducing hostility through communication,
according to its literature. It hopes to make the most of glasnost,
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``openness.''
   The group coming to Oak Park also will visit Washington D.C.;
Cassanovia, N.Y.; Redding, Calif.; and San Francisco.

   A leukemia patient learned Monday his bone
marrow does not match that of his brother, a homeless Florida man
who had refused to undergo testing until an anonymous donor offered
him $1,000.
   Stephen L. Chapman, 38, said that although he was disappointed
the marrow was not suitable for transplant, he had tried not to get
his hopes too high.
   ``You kind of start counting on things and then you have a big
letdown,'' said Chapman. ``I've just made up my mind not to count
on anything.''
   His doctors said they were presenting other treatment options to
Chapman, whose leukemia is in remission.
   ``The next best step is unknown, but there are choices,'' said
Dr. Richard S. Fayssoux, the hematology and oncology specialist
treating Chapman.
   ``The chances for him to live longer would have been better
(with the transplant), but it's not like he's guaranteed a 50-year
life with the transplant,'' Fayssoux said.
   The patient's brother, Randy Chapman, 32, was located last month
on the streets of Miami. He earns his living as a test subject for
medical experiments and initially refused to submit to tests to
determine whether his marrow matched that of his ill brother.
   He eventually accepted an Indiana philanthropist's offer of
$1,000 to take the tests. The brother, who left home 14 years ago,
would have received an additional $2,000 had there been a match and
subsequent transplant.
   Chapman, the father of two children, continues to undergo
chemotherapy treatments. Doctors have told him that forms of
treatment other than the bone marrow transplant might be less risky
and painful, but also potentially less effective.
   ``He wouldn't have the immediate risk, but he also wouldn't have
the long-term possibilities,'' said Fayssoux.
   Chapman said doctors were checking into a partial bone marrow
match located through the national marrow registry.
   ``We'll come up with something else,'' Chapman said. ``It's
pretty difficult, but I wasn't counting on it either way.''

<HEAD>Argonne Researchers Find Truck Idling Wastes Money, Damages
Engines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Letting a truck's diesel engine run at idle
causes twice as much damage as driving, and truckers who let their
rigs idle during rest stops are wasting money and diesel fuel, a
researcher said Monday.
   Some truckers have a misconception that idling is good for their
rigs, but researchers at Argonne National Laboratory found that
excess idling can shorten the life of a diesel truck engine by six
months to a year.
   ``There's a lot of misinformation out there (among truckers),''
said Larry R. Johnson, director of Argonne's Center for
Transportation Research. ``They realize it's using fuel, but some
of them perceive that it's good for the engine to keep it running.''
   In one of a series of studies for the U.S. Department of Energy
aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the trucking industry,
Johnson said Argonne researchers found that one hour of idling
causes as much engine wear as two hours of driving.
   Based on interviews with trucking company officials and drivers,
they calculated that a typical 18-wheeler idles about 800 hours a
year, the equivalent of 64,000 miles of driving, Johnson said
Monday in a telephone interview.
   He said that much idling would make the engine need an overhaul
up to a year sooner than under normal driving conditions.
   ``It wears out an engine twice as fast as being under load,''
Johnson said.
   Diesel engines usually require an overhaul every five years or
500,000 miles, he said.
   Many truckers leave their rigs running when they stop to rest as
a way of keeping the engine and diesel fuel warm in the winter, and
keeping the cab heated or cooled in summer, he said.
   But the Argonne researchers found that idling in the winter
cools the engine faster than if it were shut off because fans blow
cold air over the engine block and fuel lines, Johnson said.
   The lower idling temperature damages the engine by causing water
vapor to condense in the crankcase, said Raj Sekar, a mechanical
engineer at the Argonne transportation center.
   The water mixes with unburned sulfur oxides from diesel fuel
combustion and produces sulfuric acid, which corrodes the piston
rings and cylinder liners, he said.
   The Argonne researchers also calculated that the typical trucker
idles his engine at least three hours each workday, wasting an
estimated 800 gallons of fuel a year, Johnson said.
   As an alternative to idling, Johnson said, the Argonne study
recommended that truckers or trucking companies buy heaters for the
fuel system, engine block, cab and sleeping compartment. He said
the cost of buying each heater would pay for itself in one year
through fuel savings alone.
   Argonne, located 25 miles west of Chicago, is operated by the
University of Chicago for the Department of Energy.

   President Reagan has nominated Air Force Lt.
Gen. Merrill A. McPeak for promotion to general and assignment as
commander-in-chief of the Pacific Air Forces, the Pentagon said
Monday.
   Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate, McPeak, 52, would
receive his fourth star and the rank of full general and replace
Gen. Jack I. Gregory, 56, who will retire on Aug. 1 after 35 years
of active-duty service.
   Gregory, a native of Somerset, Ky., has commanded the Pacific
Air Forces since December 1986. McPeak, of Santa Rosa, Calif., now
commands the 12th Air Force.
   Maj. Gen. Peter T. Kempf, 51, was chosen by Reagan for promotion
to lieutenant general and command of the 12th Air Force.
   Kempf, a native of Elizabeth, N.J., now commands the Air Force
Tactical Fighter Weapons Center.

   President Reagan's spokesman Monday predicted
quick action in Congress to renew U.S. aid to Nicaragua's Contra
rebels, but there was little movement on Capitol Hill toward any
new aid package.
   ``We anticipate signing on to a bill, in the sense that we want
a Contra aid package, and we are working to get the best one that
we can get,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters. ``I think something will be very forthcoming very soon.''
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, the administration's
chief opponent on the issue, seemed disinclined to move ahead
before seeing the outcome of a new round of cease-fire talks
between the rebels and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``What we need to watch very carefully is the peace talks,''
Wright told reporters. ``I hope both sides will be very
forthcoming.''
   Asked about prospects for a $48 million Contra aid proposal
being drawn up by Senate backers of the rebels, Wright objected to
provisions that allow the CIA to continue delivering previously
stockpiled weapons and that would give Reagan a guaranteed future
vote in Congress on new military aid.
   ``If they would agree to humanitarian aid without military aid,
that could be done very swiftly,'' Wright said. ``We would be ready
to meet (with Republicans) at any time.''
   The continued standoff on the aid issue seemed to be an
indication that last week's developments in the region had little
clear impact on congressional opinion. Sandinista troops allegedly
crossed the Honduran border to attack rebel camps, and the United
States responded by sending nearly 3,200 troops into Honduras in a
symbolic show of force.
   The last U.S. aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29, and the issue has
been stalled since the House voted narrowly on March 3 to defeat a
$30 million package of strictly ``humanitarian'' help _ food,
clothing and the like _ for the rebels.
   The Senate aid package, assembled by Sens. Nancy Kassebaum,
R-Kan., David Boren, D-Okla., and others, would offer a one-year,
$48 million infusion of humanitarian aid, as well as continued
authority for the CIA to deliver weapons remaining in rebel
inventories, estimated at as much as $2.5 million.
   In addition, it would give the administration the right to a
guaranteed expedited vote on a future request for new weapons aid
to the Contras.
   Fitzwater said the administration was encouraged by the package,
but he stopped short of fully endorsing it, saying other
suggestions also were welcome.
   He said the administration would hold talks with Wright ``when
the time is right.'' Discussions with other lawmakers would
continue, he said, but he refused to name the individuals.
   President Reagan was scheduled to go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday
for a meeting with Republican House members, and aid to the rebels
was expected to be high on the list of items for discussion.
   Fitzwater said last week's Sandinista incursion had improved
chances for passage of a Contra aid bill in Congress. He said the
incident had ``left little to the imagination in terms of what
President (Daniel) Ortega and the Sandinistas are really up to.''
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said it was not
clear that the incident had changed congressional minds.
   Foley said he believed administration intelligence reports of a
well-planned Sandinista incursion involving at least 1,500 troops.
But he said it appeared casualties were low and that the Contras
``were not seriously disrupted as a force in the field. It has not
been established that there is any need for an immediate military
resupply,'' he said.

   The Reagans won't be the only famous
family in the neighborhood after Michael Jackson moves his furry,
feathered and scaled friends to a 2,700-acre spread now in escrow
for $28 million.
   Jackson has also been rumored to be interested in a $5 million
hotel near the ranch, but the owner of the Grand Hotel, William
Healey, said Monday he has not talked with the singer or his agent.
   ``It's a rumour,'' real estate broker Healey said. ``There's
absolutely no truth to it.''
   The ranch in the scenic Santa Ynez Valley 100 miles northwest of
Los Angeles was on the market for $32 million and includes a main
house on a 32-acre section, a large clubhouse and 50,000 oak trees.
Jackson had originally offered $17 million, the Los Angeles Times
reported Sunday, quoting unidentified real estate sources.
   His menagerie includes monkeys, llamas, snakes, birds, and
barnyard animals, except for a cow.
   The animals had been kept on a one-acre Encino compound near the
home where he and his family have lived since the 1960s. It's
unknown whether Jackson will sell the home, which he enlarged in
1982.
   The 1,570-sqare-foot house in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley
is now Jackson's recording studio. He built an 11,500-square-foot
house in front and a four-car garage with 850 square feet for
living quarters.

   Sandinista government and Contra rebel
leaders today announced a suspension of military operations during
the first cease-fire talks ever held inside the country.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the nation's defense minister and brother
of President Daniel Ortega, made the announcement that government
troops were halting military operations and urged the Contras to
``act in kind.''
   He called the three days of peace talks that began today in this
small town on the border with Costa Rica ``an historic encounter.''
   Bosco Matamoros, spokesman for the Contra delegation, later
announced a suspension of offensive military operations in
Nicaragua as an ``expression of our good will.'' He also said the
conversations were ``frank and of mutual respect.''
   The talks began at 11:10 a.m. (12:10 p.m. EST), more than an
hour late. Both delegations started meeting behind closed doors in
the Custom House on the border just outside Sapoa, the only
building large enough here for the event.
   Humberto Ortega is heading the Nicaraguan delegation to the
peace talks. Alfredo Cesar is the leader of the Contra delegation.
   The Sandinista delegation includes Brian Wilson _ an American
pacifist whose legs were severed when he was hit by a train during
a protest last year _ and singer Kris Kristofferson. Wilson and
Kristofferson are longtime Sandinista supporters.
   Cheering Sandinista supporters lined both sides of the
90-mile-long road from Managua to Sapoa as Ortega drove by. Many
carried red-and-black Sandinista flags, and school children waved
Nicaraguan blue-and-white paper banners.
   Mariachi bands played music along the route. The crowds shouted:
``We insist on the surrender of the mercenaries,'' as the Contras
are called by the Sandinistas.
   The Contra delegation arrived a few minutes after the
Sandinistas in a bus escorted by a group of cars and jeeps. The
entire town was closely guarded by Sandinista troops and security
agents in plainclothes.
   Adolfo Calero, another Contra leader, said the Contras came
``here with an open agenda, and that it includes democratization,
includes amnesty. We insisted on speaking about all the problems
facing Nicaragua.''
   The peace talks were held despite an earlier Sandinista
offensive along the Honduran border.
   In a break with the past, both sides agreed that the talks would
have an open agenda.
   But on Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco
reiterated a previous Sandinista position that the negotiations
strictly deal with the mechanics of a cease-fire.
   And the Contras indicated that they wanted to talk about other
matters, such as democratization and free elections.
   The Contras replaced Calero, the top-ranking leader of the
Nicaraguan Resistance, with Cesar as head of their delegation in
the hope that his familiarity with the Sandinistas might pressure
the Nicaraguan government into serious negotiations.
   Cesar was a former high-ranking Sandinista official before he
broke with the Sandinistas in 1982.
   Also scheduled to attend was Aristides Sanchez, a third member
of the directorate of the resistance, the Contra umbrella
organization.
   Entering today's sessions, Contra leaders indicated they were
not optimistic.
   ``The Sandinistas don't object to making tactical concessions,
but they will never enact reforms that risk their grip on power in
Nicaragua,'' said Contra adviser Gonzalo Facio.
   Cesar asserted the Contras had recently suffered military
setbacks, but that the Sandinista offensive had helped their cause
politically.
   Rebel fighters ``are going to be militarily weakened by the
suspension of United States aid and the growth in Soviet aid to the
Sandinistas,'' Cesar said.
   But he added that ``politically we are going to be stronger and
the Sandinistas weaker because the international community
condemned them for their bombardments last week of our positions.''
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the mediator in previous talks
and an observer to today's discussions, also seemed pessimistic
about their outcome.
   ``I see the situation as quite complicated,'' he said during his
Sunday homily in Managua. ``It is very difficult to reconcile two
things that are completely opposite.''
   The cease-fire talks are called for under a Central American
peace plan signed by the region's five presidents last Aug. 7.
   The Sandinistas have already complied with some stipulations in
the peace accord by lifting a nearly 6-year-old state of emergency
and allowing more press freedom.
   The rebels have been fighting the government since 1981 in a
conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people.

   A U.S. Army transport helicopter participating
in a military exercise in Honduras crashed on Monday, and a number
of soldiers were reported injured, Pentagon officials said.
   The officials, who requested anonymity, said the accident
occurred Monday afternoon near the Honduran town of Juticalpa and
involved an American UH-1 Huey transport copter.
   While the initial reports were fragmentary, it appeared that the
copter was carrying nine soldiers and that all of them survived,
the sources said.
   ``We have no reports of any fatalities,'' said one official.
``But we do have reports of some injuries and medical evacuations
under way.''
   The sources said the accident did not occur in or near a combat
zone and did not involve hostile fire.
   ``It looks like it was mechanical,'' said one official.
   The accident scene was said to be located about six miles south
of Juticalpa. That would place it 35 miles north of the
Honduras-Nicaragua border and about 60 miles west of the border
region where Nicaraguan troops were fighting Contra guerrillas last
week.
   The Pentagon sources, who stressed they were awaiting more
information from U.S. authorities in Honduras, said it was unclear
whether the nine aboard the Huey were all American or whether some
of the passengers might have included Honduran troops.
   The United States airlifted more than 3,100 Army troops to
Honduras last week in a warning to the leftist Sandinista
government, after Nicaraguan troops moved into Honduras to attack
base camps of the U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas.
   After arriving in Honduras, the American soldiers dispersed
around the country for joint exercises with Honduran forces. One of
those exercise areas is near Juticalpa, and a battalion from the
82nd Airborne Division was sent to that site.
   The Reagan administration has made it clear it does not intend
to send the U.S. troops into combat with the Sandinistas.
Administration sources said Monday it appeared the fighting was
ending in any event and that Nicaragua was withdrawing its troops
from Honduran soil.
   According to the Pentagon sources, the UH-1 that crashed Monday
was apparently assigned to U.S. forces in Panama and was not
airlifted to the country by the 82nd Airborne.
   The Pentagon maintains a force of about 1,100 military personnel
in Honduras as part of what is known as Joint Task Force Bravo to
oversee training exercises in the Central American country.

   Rising to what one called a ``once-in-a-lifetime
chance,'' engineers from around the world unveiled designs Monday
for a new Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan _ even
though the old bridge may not have to be replaced.
   The 85-year-old span over the East River is slowly
disintegrating, although officials have not decided whether to
rebuild or replace it.
   One of the 25 designs submitted calls for a bridge with two
48-story towers topped by V-shaped structures, one holding a
restaurant and one a museum.
   Another, designed by an international consortium that includes
the architect I.M. Pei, feature a roadway held by two metal
wishbones slightly twisted like a ribbon pulled taut and given a
half turn.
   But the designs may never span anything but the imagination.
   Since announcing the competition for a new bridge last year,
local officials have discovered that the bridge may not be as close
to collapse as was feared. Although a 1985 study showed that the
bridge would have to be replaced by 1995, later inspections have
indicated that it might last longer.
   Preliminary estimates indicate that the bridge could be
renovated for about $250 million. Estimates for a new bridge range
from $200 million to $600 million.
   Still, bridge engineers attending Monday's unveiling said they
could not resist the opportunity to design a major new bridge for
one of the world's largest cities.
   ``Such a location you'll never find again,'' said Swiss engineer
Bruno Thurlimann of Zurich, who collaborated on a Swiss-American
proposal with I.M. Pei & Partners and three other companies. ``It's
a once-in-a-lifetime chance.''
   Asking why an engineer submitted a design is ``like asking Sir
Edmund Hillary, `Why did you climb (Mount Everest)?''' said Nils D.
Olsson of DRC Consultants Inc.
   ``Structural engineers are always looking for fresh challenges,
and this is one of the most important projects since the
Verrazano,'' he said.
   Olsson, whose New York firm proposed the restaurant-topped
bridge, was referring to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, a link
completed in 1964 between Brooklyn and Staten Island. With 4,260
feet between supports, it is one of the world's longest suspension
bridge.
   Most of the designs for the Williamsburg call for a 1,600-foot
cable-stayed bridge that would be the longest of its type in the
world.
   A cable-stayed bridge has cables stretching from its towers to
the roadway, while a suspension bridge has a roadway hung from
cables stretching from one side to the other.

<HEAD>US Selling 30,000 Tons Of Non-Fat Dry Milk To Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has sold Mexico 30,000
metric tons of surplus non-fat dry milk for $1,260 per ton, about a
third less than it cost American taxpayers, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said the surplus
powdered milk was sold by the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
to CONASUPO, the Mexican government's food purchasing authority.
   Goldberg said the sale ``reflects the world market price for
non-fat dry milk at the time the sale was negotiated'' with Mexico.
Deliveries are scheduled through March 1989. In addition, the CCC
provided Mexico with a three-year credit arrangement at commercial
rates of interest, he said.
   According to a recent CCC report, about 454 million pounds of
non-fat dry milk were held in storage, with a value of more than
$385 million, or about 85 cents per pound.
   There are approximately 2,205 pounds in a metric ton, which
translates to a U.S. value of $1,874 per ton.
   The surplus was acquired by CCC through purchases of cheese,
butter and non-fat dry milk to support the price of milk paid to
dairy farmers.
   Congress in 1985 farm law mandated the export sale of 150,000
tons of dairy products annually for the three fiscal years ending
Sept. 30, 1988. The latest deal with Mexico boosted sales this year
to 77,520 tons, Goldberg said.

   The latest squabble between prosecutors and
defense attornyes isn't about cases, tactics or money. It's about
being able to bypass new security procedures at the Dirksen Federal
Building, and it's headed for _ where else? _ the bench.
   Complaints from the public have been few, but the security
system brought the entire U.S. District Court system here to a
screeching halt one afternoon and prompted 39 attorneys _ including
several of Chicago's best-known defenders _ to petition the
district's 21 judges for the same exemptions granted to prosecutors
and building employees. A decision is expected Thursday.
   ``Things are bad enough when the lines stretch all the way
around the (elevator) bank,'' attorney Judith Halprin, who is
spear-heading the defenders' effort, said Monday.
   ``But when they decided to give exemptions to prosecutors,'' she
added, ``that was the last straw.''
   Replied U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas: ``We're being given
exemptions because we're employees of the building, no more, no
less. ... This seems to be a means by which certain people can keep
their names in the paper.''
   The U.S. Marshal's office said the procedures were in response
to a growing number of threats against the federal judiciary
nationwide and an increase in terrorism trials. They follow recent
trials of members of the El Rukn street gang and the Puerto Rican
independence group, FALN, on terrorism-related charges.
   Ms. Halprin's first act of defiance came March 8, the day the
airport-type screening began with federal marshals using metal
detectors for all people heading to courtroom floors and X-ray
machines for briefcases.
   Ms. Halprin, invoking her constitutional rights against
unreasonable search and seizure, refused to step through the metal
detector on her way to U.S. District Judge Brian Duff's courtroom.
   That was 10 a.m. Ms. Halprin waited in the lobby for more than
two hours while her client, charged with selling phony immigration
papers to an undercover agent, stood before Duff.
   The judge issued an order exempting Ms. Halprin, but she
remained there for another two hours because a marshal refused to
disobey Chief U.S. District Judge John Grady's original directive.
   Duff responded by ordering Chief U.S. Marshal John Adams to
appear before him and explain why he should not be held in contempt
of court.
   Duff himself was then called to an emergency meeting of the
district's judges and a new order resulted: Attorneys working
trials that began prior to March 8 could be exempted for the
duration of that trial.
   But that hasn't satisfied Ms. Halprin and her colleagues.
   ``They're exempting whole classes of people, Chicago policemen
for example,'' she said. ``Well one of us was representing a cop
subpoenaed by a grand jury.
   ``So, the target of the investigation gets to go through
untouched,'' she added, ``and the lawyer is the one subjected to a
search of his person and papers.
   ``Now is that silly or not?''

<HEAD>Placing Deaf Students in Regular Schools Isn't Working, Panel Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to place deaf students in regular
public schools have backfired, leaving many deaf students with an
inadequate education, a government commission told a Senate panel
Monday.
   ``The state of the art in deafness education today at all levels
is unsatisfactory,'' Frank R. Bowe, who chaired the Commission on
Education of the Deaf, told the Senate Labor and Human Resources
subcommittee on the handicapped. ``We still have high school
graduates reading below a third-grade level.''
   The 13-member commission, established by Congress in 1986,
concluded that the Education Department should consider placing
deaf students in special schools or centers for the deaf, instead
of forcing them to compete with their hearing counterparts.
   ``Those of us who are deaf have had access to some form of
education, but it's not been a good one, and it's not getting
better,'' said Bowe, a regional commissioner of the Rehabilitation
Services Administration, who also is deaf.
   Two-thirds of the panel themselves are deaf. The commission,
made up of government officials and educators of the deaf, also
included actress Nanette Fabray MacDougall.
   The report also recommended that a majority of the board of
trustees of Gallaudet University be hearing impaired, which was a
demand made by students at the school for the deaf during protests
earlier this month.
   The commission concluded that significant improvements have been
made in techniques for educating the deaf since 1965, when a
federal panel last suggested changes.
   The report also determined, however, that ``the actual
implementation of these changes has been inadequate and sometimes
misguided, and that progress has been at best spotty and sporadic.''
   The commission found that 95 percent of America's deaf students
are ``prelingually deaf'' _ left without hearing at birth or
deprived of it in infancy _ and recommended improvements in
identifying these children and teaching them English.
   ``Early intervention programs are very important,'' said
Gertrude Galloway, a commission member. ``Right now, many children
come to school at 4 or 5 with no language.''
   The commission also called for expansion of post-secondary
education programs, including vocational and technical training,
junior college and college programs. Currently, there are two
colleges in the nation for deaf students, and four regional
post-secondary programs housed at hearing colleges.
   The commission also recommended that the Department of Education
include American Sign Language _ the native language to most of
those born deaf _ under the Bilingual Education Act, which would
treat ASL like any other foreign language. This would give deaf
students access to special training programs other foreign-language
students now receive.
   Establishment of a National Institute on Deafness as part of the
federal National Insititutes of Health is another priority of the
commission, along with the creation of a National Technical
Insititute for the Deaf at Gallaudet.
   The commission also instructed Congress to pass legislation
requiring the Federal Communications Commission to issue rules
making new televisions capable of decoding closed-caption
broadcasts. Until those sets are common, decoders should be
distributed free, the commission said.
   The commission took 20 months to interview deaf education
specialists, students and school administrators before coming up
with the 52 recommendations included in the 144-page report.
   A House panel will hold hearings on the commission's study next
week, and Senate and House committees then will work with the
Department of Education to establish some of the proposed changes.
   Members of the deaf community lauded the report.
   ``The commission is on target,'' said Philip Bravin, an IBM
executive named last week to chair Gallaudet's board of trustees.
``The education of the deaf in America needs to be improved. I'm
doing OK, but many of my friends and peers aren't.''

<HEAD>Bottle Released By High School Biology Class Turns Up In France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bottle containing a note from a high
school class probably languished for two years in the Gulf Stream
before a hurricane swept it to the coast of France, a marine
biology teacher said.
   The bottle was found by Pierre Maupin the day after the storm
hit the Brittany village of Carnac in northwest France last
October, said John Gregory, a teacher at John I. Leonard High
School.
   ``It was ironic _ the guy who found it didn't show excitement,''
Gregory said Friday. ``He just filled out the information sheet,
sent it back, and that was it.''
   But students at the school, who received Maupin's reply in late
December, are enthusiastic about the bottle-releasing project,
which is aimed at helping them learn more about ocean currents.
   ``(When) he told us what we would be doing, at first it didn't
seem as exciting. But when we started getting the letters back, it
seemed interesting,'' said 16-year-old Anthony Izzarone.
   Since 1976, Gregory's classes have released about 900
silicone-sealed bottles 30 miles off Florida's Gold Coast into the
Gulf Stream. So far, 104 bottles have been found in locations
ranging from Cape Canaveral and Melbourne, just up the Florida
coast, to the Azores Islands in the mid-Atlantic.
   The high school's experiments have a return rate of 11 percent.
That's much better than the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which gets back only about 2 percent of the bottles
it puts in the ocean to test currents, Gregory said.

<HEAD>Final Search Planned Before Bird Declared Officially Extinct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists still nagged by the
demise of the last known dusky seaside sparrow plan a final search
of the bird's one-time habitat before writing an epitaph.
   A search of the area near Kennedy Space Center had been planned
for this spring, even though regional officials of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service are convinced there are no more duskies.
   A final search will be conducted in about a year before the
dusky is declared extinct, said John Christian, deputy assistant
regional director of the wildlife service in Atlanta.
   State and federal officials sponsor the bird-watching expedition
in which volunteers will go through area with binoculars. If no
duskies are spotted, the species will be considered extinct.
   The last tiny dusky died of old age in June in a specially
designed environment on Discovery Island, a Walt Disney World
zoological park primarily for birds. The last five survivors, all
males, were taken there from their only known wildlife habitat on
Cape Canaveral several years ago.
   They were bred with close cousins, seeking to preserve their
genes, but they died one by one.
   The bird's decline began in the 1940s when mosquito fighters
began spraying DDT over the St. Johns River Refuge marshlands,
ruining the duskies' eggs and insect food supply.
   Although they were protected by law, conservationists say the
birds did not have much chance against diking, drainage,
land-clearing, highway construction, housing developments,
mosquito-control projects and fires.
   ``We have laws protecting the species, but not the habitat,''
said John Wood, a federal official. ``You can protect the species
all you want, but if you don't have the habitat, they have no place
to go and won't make it.''
   But Christian pointed out that the 5,000-acre St. Johns refuge
was purchased for $3 million to protect the dusky.
   ``We thought we had enough habitat to sustain them, and then the
population just crashed,'' Christian said. ``We will never know
what biological mechanism was responsible. Nobody really knows.''
   Charles Cook, curator of Discovery Island and a leader in the
fight to preserve the dusky genes, said he hoped that someday some
of the part-duskies will be released on an experimental basis in
the protected area.
   Cook believes there is a chance one or more of the birds may
exist in a remote section of the refuge.
   ``Scientists always keep the option open,'' he said. ``I
definitely feel it is worth looking into, particularly in a
peripheral habitat not frequently visited by people.''

<TEXT>
   A commuter train on Monday slammed into a
truck that crashed through the railroad crossing gates, injuring at
least 16 people, authorities said.
   The semi tractor-trailer, carrying medium-duty trucks, burst
into flames upon impact, and the driver was seriously injured,
authorities said.
   The force of the crash sent two passenger cars off the train
tracks and broke the engineer's leg, authorities said.
   The Metra commuter train, headed from Joliet to Chicago, was
carrying 16 passengers and five crew members, and likely was
traveling at about 50 mph when it hit the truck a mile west of New
Lenox, said Metra spokesman Chris Knapton.
   ``As the crossing signals became activated, the driver of the
tractor-trailer combination continued southbound and attempted to
beat the train,'' said Will County sheriff's Lt. Jim Srygler.
   ``The truck driver smashed through railroad crossing gates. The
gate came down on his hood,'' Knapton said.
   Sixteen people, including the engineer and the truck driver,
were taken to Silver Cross Hospital in Joliet, a spokeswoman said.
Most were treated and released.
   The truck driver, Terry Lewis, 34, of Drayton Plains, Mich., was
in serious condition, said the spokeswoman.
   Police would not immediately talk about any charges that could
be filed.

   Vice President George Bush is the
overwhelming favorite going into New York's April 19 primary among
likely Republican voters questioned for a statewide poll released
Monday.
   The Marist County Institute for Public Opinion reported that of
the 292 likely Republican voters sampled, 68 percent favored Bush,
22 percent opted for Kansas Sen. Bob Dole nd 3 percent went for Pat
Robertson. Six percent said they were undecided and less than 1
percent picked another candidate. The margin of error was plus or
minus 6 percent.
   The institute also reported that in theoretical matchups between
Bush and the major Democratic candidates, the vice president came
out ahead of every Democrat except Massachusetts Gov. Michael

<HEAD>Ohio Primary Too Late, Professor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The political damage Ohio and other
urban states may be doing to themselves by holding late-season
presidential primaries could go beyond having fewer candidate
choices, an elections researcher says.
   Linda L.M. Bennett, a political science professor at Wittenberg
University, says the problems of Ohio's cities and others in the
Northeast and Midwest may be ignored as candidates look past Ohio's
May 3 primary and toward the clincher _ California, which holds its
primary June 7.
   The problem begins with the emphasis placed on the February Iowa
caucuses, Ms. Bennett says.
   ``It emphasizes all the old classic themes of American
politics,'' such as the romanticized notion of farming, she said.
But urban problems are getting lost in the shuffle.
   ``It would be nice if they addressed the issues of the 90
percent of us who live in urban areas,'' Ms. Bennett said.

   Here are some of the recommendations made
Monday by the Commission on Education of the Deaf in a
congressionally ordered report:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The U.S. Department of Education should put less emphasis on
placing deaf students in the ``least restrictive environment'' and
more on providing an appropriate education. For many, that means
special schools and centers for the deaf.
   _The department should specify that removing a deaf child from a
regular classroom does not require ``compelling evidence.''
   _Congress should grant full recognition to American Sign
Language as a ``native'' language, just like Spanish, under the
Bilingual Education Act and programs.
   _More help and services for low-achieving deaf students, not
just the college bound.
   _Congress should require the Federal Communications Commission
to force broadcasters to caption their programming, and consider
the same requirement for film producers.
   _Congress ``should caption its own televised proceedings.''
   _Congress should require the FCC to issue rules making new TV
sets capable of decoding closed captions. Until such sets become
widely available, decoders should be distributed free to the deaf.
   _Earlier identification of deaf infants. It isn't necessary to
test the hearing of every newborn, just those at high risk of
hearing impairments.
   _The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services should issue
guidelines to help states improve screening procedures.
   _Parents should have the option to choose what type of school
their child attends, and must ``believe in whichever communication
method is chosen for their child's educational program.''
   _Congress should pass a ``Quality in Deaf Education'' bill.
   _Changes should be made in the management of Gallaudet
University, including appointment of a majority of deaf people to
its board of trustees.
   _Congress should bar hearing undergraduates from Gallaudet,
which in 1985 began to admit a handful interested in careers in
education of the deaf.
   _The Model Secondary School for the Deaf at Gallaudet should
admit more low-achieving deaf students so that it ``more closely
mirrors the national demographics of secondary school-age deaf
children.''
   _The government should expand its regional postsecondary
education program to the Southwest. It now has programs in other
regions.
   _Congress should establish a National Center on Deafness
Research at Gallaudet.
   _Congress should create a National Institute on Deafness and
Other Communication Disorders at the National Institutes of Health.
   _Gallaudet and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in
Rochester, N.Y., should limit enrollment of foreign students to 10
percent, and charge them 75 percent of the actual costs, or about
$18,250 a year.
   _Both Gallaudet and NTID should do a better job of hiring the
deaf. Only 12 percent of the staff at NTID and 25 percent at
Gallaudet are deaf.

South Africa's denial of a visa to U.S. civil rights leader Joseph
Lowery.
   ``We believe that greater, not lesser contact between our two
societies is needed,'' said State Department spokesman Charles
Redman.
   The South African embassy in Washington gave no reason for the
denial it issued over the weekend, said Evelyn Lowery, whose
husband is president of the Southern Christian Leadership

   ``We ... have our suspicions. You know the situation in South
Africa, the persecution of black leaders there, and they certainly
know we're in sympathy (with South Africa's blacks),'' she said.
   Kevin Brennan, an embassy spokesman, confirmed Lowery's
application for a visa was denied. He declined to give a reason.
   Lowery, who was in Massachusetts Monday lecturing at Holy Cross
College, had planned to deliver a sermon at Martin Luther King Jr.
memorial services scheduled in South Africa Friday through Sunday.

   Eligible stockholders in six financially
troubled production credit associations in the Omaha, Neb., and
Spokane, Wash., districts will receive par value cash or credit for
their stock, the Farm Credit System Assistance Board said Monday.
   Eric P. Thor, head of the board, said the compensation will go
to those whose stock was either frozen or not retired at par when
the associations went into liquidation.
   Acting under the new Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, the board
``initiated a series of agreements resulting in the issuance of
preferred stock on behalf of the associations in liquidation'' to a
related entity, the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corp.
   The corporation will provide more than $20.5 million to retire
the frozen stock, Thor said. As a result, association borrowers
whose stock was frozen or retired at less than par value will be
able to collect par value for their stock.
   Stockholders should receive checks or notification of credit
within a few weeks, he said.
   The associations in liquidation in the Omaha district are the
O'Neill and Valentine production credit associations. In the
Spokane district, the PCAs are Glendive, Milk River, Western
Montana and Western Washington.
   The associations, which are cooperatively owned by the
borrowers, extend loans to farmers to meet production expenses.

   State Attorney General Robert Abrams said
Monday he will prevent representatives of Tawana Brawley from
disrupting the grand jury hearing evidence into the black
teen-ager's allegations that she was sexually attacked by six white
men.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York City minister advising the
16-year-old girl, has threatened to stop anyone from testifying
Tuesday at the grand jury hearing. Sharpton said he'd risk arrest
to stop the proceedings.
   ``I don't think there is a need or necessity to move the grand
jury, but we would take any and all steps that are necessary to
protect the integrity of the grand jury process,'' Abrams said at a
news conference.
   Representatives of Miss Brawley have refused to cooperate with
state prosecutors investigating the alleged racial and sexual
attack. They have criticized suggestions that witnesses might be
granted immunity in exchange for their testimony.
   The teen-ager's lawyers want a special prosecutor named to
investigate race-related crimes, for Abrams to be removed from the
case and for a new grand jury to be convened outside of Dutchess
County.
   Abrams also said he was appalled at the telecast of photos of
Miss Brawley shortly after her alleged November attack by a group
of white men and is investigating how a television station got the
pictures.
   He said no one in his office authorized the release of the
photos, which were shown Thursday night on WNBC in New York City
and nationally on the NBC's network news.
   ``I was indeed quite upset,'' Abrams said, adding ``it's a
serious invasion of the privacy of the victim.''
   One of the photos shows the word ``nigger'' scrawled on Miss
Brawley's stomach and another shows her lying in her hospital bed
with monitoring devices attached to her upper torso.
   Mary Lou O'Callaghan, director of news information for NBC, said
the network would not reveal the source of the photos. ``We covered
what has become a significant news story,'' she said in defense of
the telecast.
   Abrams said he was confident that no one in the attorney
general's task force released the photos. Other law enforcement
agencies that investigated the case might have given the photos
away, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has quietly increased the number
of security personnel in Panama, dispatching more than 300 soldiers
to the strife-torn country in the past three days, officials said
Monday.
   Two-thirds of those dispatched during the latest troop movement
were members of the 503rd Military Police Battalion, which is
headquartered at Fort Bragg, N.C., the Pentagon said.
   The remainder were dispatched from Fort Eustis, Va., and Fort
Hood, Texas.
   Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in response
to a query that ``212 members of the 503rd Military Police
Battalion have deployed to Panama to augment U.S. security forces
in that country.''
   ``This deployment of military police is not in response to any
incident, but simply good planning in view of the current unrest in
Panama,'' she continued.
   The deployment began last Friday ``and is a prudent measure,
consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty, to further safeguard the
canal and U.S. lives, property and interests in the area,'' she
said.
   In addition to the MPs, about 100 soldiers from Forts Eustis and
Hood were dispatched ``to assist in the movement of these
additional security force personnel and to augment U.S. Southern
Command security forces,'' she added.
   Those soldiers are ``Army airfield movements control
personnel,'' the spokeswoman said.
   The latest dispatch of troops comes less than a week after the
Pentagon ordered slightly more than 100 Marine and Air Force
security personnel to Panama to bolster security around the Panama
Canal and nearby military bases.
   All told, about 420 security personnel have now been sent to
Panama to join the roughly 600 servicemen who already were assigned
to security duties with the U.S. Southern Command, which is
headquartered there.
   The Southern Command, which oversees all U.S. military
operations in the region, has about 10,000 servicemen assigned to
it.
   The Pentagon's security concerns stem from the administration's
efforts to unseat Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Although no moves have been reported against American servicemen
or their dependents, defense officials are said to be concerned
that Noriega might lash back at the United States by attacking or
sabotaging facilities there.

former Denver Election Commissioner Susan Duncan, leader of a group
fighting the recall.
   Recall organizers must prove at least 39,091 signatures are of
registered voters in order to force a new election. The ballot
would include Pena and all candidates who collected 300 valid
nominating signatures.
   The recall drive against Pena, now in his second term, is rooted
in the public works department, where employees began gathering
after last summer's mayoral election to air their grievances.
   By fall, the workers, who complained Pena is a poor manager, had
hired Doty, retired director of admissions at Denver General
Hospital.
   ``Basically, we're guiding ourselves by intuition,'' Doty said
in an interview last week. ``The political expertise is coming from
the seat of my pants.''
   The petition drive was launched Jan. 15 amid criticism of Pena's
snow-removal efforts after a Christmas weekend snowstorm left
unplowed, impassable streets. The effort was fueled by television
reports last month that street crews, who were followed and
secretly filmed, were loafing on duty.
   But even if enough valid signatures are collected, it could be
months before an election is held.
   After April 13, Pena will have 10 days to challenge signatures,
and the election commission will have 50 days to conduct hearings
on the mayor's appeal.
   If there are enough valid signatures, the City Council will have
to schedule an election within 60 to 90 days.
   Pena would be reimbursed by the city for any legal challenge to
the petitions. If he won the recall election, the state would
reimburse him for campaign expenses.

<HEAD>China Purchases Additional 200,000 Tons Of US Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exporters have sold China an additional
200,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The sale, equal to 7.34 million bushels, was handled by
Continental Grain Co. and will be shipped in the 1988-89 wheat
marketing year that begins on June 1.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales were part of an
authorized 1.2 million tons of wheat announced Feb. 5 under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $2.67
per bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $20 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   China bought more than 4 million tons of wheat under previous
EEP arrangements, which allow exporters to sell commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonus averaged $24.45 per ton, or about 67 cents
per bushel of wheat. The bonuses will be paid in the form of
surplus commodities owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   China has 260,000 tons remaining for use under the EEP
initiative announced on Feb. 5, he said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Ed Flanders, making a sentimental
return for the last episode of NBC's ``St. Elsewhere,'' surprised
fellow actors and angered producers by delivering an unscripted
soliloquy on death, it was reported Monday.
   Flanders, who earlier this season left his role as Dr. Donald
Westphall, was back for a farewell to the series, which is leaving
the air at the end of the season.
   The script taped Friday called for Flanders, as Westphall, to
make a touching statement about beginnings and endings at St.
Eligius Hospital, otherwise known as ``St. Elsewhere.'' Instead,
USA Today reported, he talked about death as his fellow actors
looked on bewildered.
   ``He spoiled the moment for everybody,'' producer Tom Fontana
told the newspaper.
   Executive producer Bruce Paltrow called Flanders' speech ``a
tragedy.''
   Fontana and Paltrow declined to talk about the incident Monday,
but Larry Bloustein, a spokesman for MTM Enterprises, which
produces the show, said they confirmed the accuracy of the report.
   There was no immediate word on what the producers would do,
although there was talk of refilming it with Dr. Mark Craig, played
by William Daniels, reading the lines.

<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS has meant isolation and poverty
for a family of four, two with AIDS and two exposed to the fatal
disease, said the father.
   The parents, who agreed to be interviewed by The Tampa Tribune
if their identities were protected, lost their jobs and were forced
to seek government assistance. Their two cars were repossessed and
furniture sold to pay debts and buy food, said the couple, who are
in their 30s.
   The woman said she confided in a friend at work, who told the
boss. She and her husband, who worked in the entertainment field,
were fired, she said.
   ``We were rejected by almost everyone we knew, everyone we
worked with,'' he said.
   The couple said they filed a discrimination complaint with the
Florida Commission on Human Relations but dropped the case after an
investigator told them that fighting their ex-employer would expose
the family to a traumatic public argument, possibily involving
their children.
   The father said he was infected with the AIDS virus through a
sexual encounter with another man years ago, The Tribune reported
Monday.
   Unknowingly carrying the virus, he married in 1980 and two years
later fathered a son. He was healthy, he said, except for a nagging
cough and a shortness of breath one doctor attributed to asthma.
   Then, early last year, while his wife was pregnant with their
second child, he learned he had acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, the newspaper reported.
   Worse, he learned his 6-year-old son has AIDS. His wife is being
treated for AIDS-related complex, a less-severe condition
associated with the AIDS virus.
   And their 7-month-old son has tested positive for AIDS
antibodies, but doctors don't know if he will develop the disease.
   A couple of months ago, the father said, ``I was ready to die.''
But his outlook changed, he said, mainly because of an AIDS support
group and the realization that his family needed him.
   ``Before you die of AIDS,'' he said, ``you have to live with
it.''
   Today, the family primarily lives on Social Security disability
payments. Medical costs average more than $1,100 a month, and they
must pay $251 before Medicaid's catastrophic health-care plan picks
up the rest.
   ``When you look at it from the financial point of view, it looks
pretty bleak,'' he said. ``So we don't look at it that way.''

<HEAD>Man Who Took Wife And Two Sons Hostage Dies After Killing One Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who held his ex-wife and two sons
hostage in a deadly burst of violence at his trailer home had been
jailed recently for a similar, less violent episode, authorities
said Monday.
   Police said Jerry Staggs, 40, shot one man to death outside the
trailer Sunday morning and, after holding his children and ex-wife
hostage for eight hours, shot himself in the head Sunday night.
Staggs died Monday morning.
   Sheriff Joe Patterson said Staggs, who worked for the city's
maintenance department, had been taken into custody earlier this
month and accused of abducting Sherry Staggs, 27, who had been
married to him for 11 years.
   The sheriff said officers ``tried to get the mental health
center to talk with him when we had him in jail for kidnapping his
ex-wife ... but they wouldn't talk to him.''
   Gary Porier, County Mental Health Center director, said he had
``no direct knowledge'' of the sheriff's request. ``We always go to
any law enforcement emergency call if they ask us,'' he said.
   There were no reports of any injuries in the earlier incident.
   But on Sunday morning Staggs killed Don Pressnell, 41, as he
drove up with Mrs. Staggs and her brother, Eddie Hamilton, 28.
   Hamilton said the Staggs' marriage legally ended March 16 with
Mrs. Staggs getting custody of their 9-year-old son, Michael.
Hamilton said she was going to take the boy on an outing when
Staggs became irritated at seeing Pressnell and pulled a gun.
   ``He shot him (Pressnell) once in the head and then started
shooting at me,'' said Hamilton. ``He emptied that gun but he
missed me. I threw a cup of coffee on him and he pulled another gun
out of his pocket and pointed it at Sherry's head and made her and
Michael go back inside.''
   Scotty Staggs, his 15-year-old son from an earlier marriage,
also was at the home and held hostage.
   About 25 law enforcement officers surrounded the trailer and
evacuated residents of other mobile homes in the trailer park.
Staggs used his 15-year-old son to communicate with police. The boy
told officers ``we'll all be dead'' if authorities tried to enter
the trailer. ``My daddy's word is worth gold.''
   About 6 p.m., the 9-year-old was released and about a half-hour
later, the 15-year-old was freed. Then a shot rang out and Mrs.
Staggs fled the trailer. She said Staggs had shot himself in the
head.
   Police found the critically wounded man inside and had him flown
by helicopter to the hospital, where he died shortly before 5 a.m.
Monday.

<HEAD>Gephardt Meets With Iacocca, Defends `$48,000 K-Car' Ad</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 4th graf pvs with 2 grafs to CORRECT spelling of Riegle
and show difference between two trade proposals, Gephardt said ...</NOTE>

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Chrysler Corp. chief Lee
Iacocca at his side, Democrat Richard Gephardt on Monday defended
his presidential campaign's ``$48,000 K-car'' television
advertisement, saying critics are missing the point.
   And he suggested that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis might
be easing his opposition to Gephardt's tough trade legislation.
   ``You may be seeing a battlefield conversion ... by the end of
the week he may be supporting the Gephardt amendment,'' the
Missouri congressman said of his Democratic presidential rival.
   Gephardt said Dukakis told Michigan Democrats over the weekend
that he supported trade legislation by Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of
Michigan _ which Gephardt said was the Senate counterpart to his
own bill.
   However, there are differences between the proposals offered by
the two lawmakers. Gephardt's amendment targets ``excess and
unwarranted'' trade surpluses for elimination without specifically
going after trade barriers. Riegle's proposal, a compromise with
critics of the Gephardt amendment, directs the U.S. trade
representative to secure the removal of unfair trade barriers.
   Gephardt said he must win Michigan's caucuses Saturday to keep
his campaign alive. He spent the day campaigning across the state,
speaking to law students at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, visiting a steel mill in Trenton and meeting with Iacocca in
Highland Park.
   He brushed aside suggestions that his K-car advertisement
inaccurately claimed that the $10,000 Chrysler car would cost
$48,000 in South Korea. Asked if the figure was correct, Iacocca
said Gephardt has the point correct, whatever the details.
   ``Close to it. Maybe it's only $35-40,000, but don't lose sight
of it, it's still a big difference between $7,000 here for a
comparable car,'' Iacocca told reporters outside the Chrysler Corp.
headquarters near Detroit.
   The Detroit Free Press reported Monday that a K-car would cost
about $33,000 in Korea but that none is sold there. And Gephardt in
an interview with the Detroit News admitted that many of those
taxes are levied in Korea on domestic consumption.
   Gephardt said the ad was designed to educate voters to the
problems created by foreign barriers to American products.
   ``The Hyundai ad is simply to get them to see what we face,'' he
said.
   ``I'm told the ad is imperfect because they have enough taxes in
South Korea so that a South Korean has to pay $29,000 for
Hyundai,'' Gephardt told 400 law students in Ann Arbor. ``They
don't want their people to buy cars ... That's an export platform
... We can't have those.''
   Later on the campaign bus, Gephardt said the debate misses the
point: `I really don't think it is South Koreans' interest to get
into this: Is it $38,000 or $48,000?''
   At the Chrysler Corp. headquarters, Gephardt met privately with
Iacocca. At a outdoor news conference, both men said they talked
about trade and not about an endorsement.
   ``Dick's a good friend of mine and he knows what he's talking
about on trade,'' Iacocca said.
   Gephardt praised the corporate chief for his help on trade
policy.
   ``He was one who stood up for the Gephardt trade amendment on
the floor and said it would improve our trade policy,'' Gephardt
said.
   Gephardt said there was no delay in getting his trade amendment
through a congressional conference committee.
   ``This week we're going to send the offer back to the Senate.
They sent up their bill. We're going to send them our bill ... I
want to get the trade bill done and when it's done, it's going to
be a tough new trade policy along the lines of the Gephardt
amendment,'' he said.
   ``Every other Democratic candidate has been critical of the
Gephardt trade amendment. Gov. Dukakis has said it is dead,''
Gephardt said. ``He agrees, I guess with the Wall Street Journal
editorial page, foreign business interests and the Reagan
administration, who all want to see the Gephardt Amendment dead.
The Gephardt amendment is alive and well and we're going to pass
it.''
   In the speech at the law school, where he was graduated,
Gephardt discarded a prepared text in which he admitted his
campaign is reeling.
   ``Yes, we've had some setbacks. But the view from the canvas is
quite an education. And what I've learned is that defeat is not
being knocked down _ defeat is not getting back up,'' he said in
his prepared text. ``There's no quit in me and there's not quit in
you.''
   Earlier, in Highland Park, Gephardt said: ``I'm going to do well
in Michigan. The people in Michigan are interested in someone who
is really going to stand up on the trade issue. They know I'm that
candidate ... Obviously I need a good result here.''

<TEXT>
   Rightists stunned the ruling
Christian Democrats on Monday with a landslide victory in
legislative and municipal elections, weakening President Jose
Napoleon Duarte in his last year in office.
   Voters ignored a leftist guerrilla call to boycott the elections
and threats of violence and turned out in great numbers Sunday to
elect legislators and municipal officials from 262 towns and cities
nationwide.
   Mario Samayoa, president of the Central Elections Council, said
more than 50 percent of the votes cast went to the Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena.
   The rout included the election of Arena candidate Armando
Calderon Sol, a 39-year-old lawyer, as mayor of San Salvador in a
race against Alejandro Duarte, son of Duarte.
   The defeat in the capital, home to 1.5 million of the country's
5 million people, was especially bitter because the Christian
Democrats had held the post since 1964.
   Final results of the nationwide races were not expected before
Tuesday night.
   The guerrillas rejected the elections as illegitimate,
contending they could not be free and fair in wartime.
   Samayoa said Monday that more than 70 percent of the 1.6 million
registered voters cast ballots.
   ``We knew they (the guerrillas) would not be able to daunt the
people, to intimidate them,'' he said.
   Samayoa's announcement of a majority for Arena meant the triumph
was even greater than the rightists had originally predicted,
increasing their membership in 60-seat National Assembly from 13 to
at least 30.
   Such a tally would guarantee Arena control of the legislature
because two small rightist parties supportive of Arena are assured
of at least one seat apiece.
   Local media projections gave Arena between 33 and 35 seats. The
Christian Democrats entered the race with 33 seats.
   The upset by Arena drastically altered prospects for Duarte, one
of the staunchest U.S. allies in Central America, in his final year
as president. It raised big questions about El Salvador will
proceed in its fight against an 8-year-old guerrilla insurgency and
how it will deal with staggering problems of underdevelopment
aggravated by the conflict.
   Arena, formed in 1981, is fiercely nationalistic. Its founder,
retired army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson, has blasted the United
States and is considered the boss of early 1980s death-squads.
   Former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador Robert White once
described d'Aubuisson _ who retained his legislative seat in
Sunday's vote _ as ``a pathological killer.''
   D'Aubuisson has rejected such charges, as well as the term
``death squads.'' He says citizens were obliged to defend
themselves against leftist ``terrorists.''
   The party's president, Alfredo Cristiani, a coffee-grower and
businessman who was educated at Georgetown University, has been
trying to project an image of moderation for the past two years.
Cristiani also retained his seat in the legislature.
   ``El Salvador needs support and would probably be in difficult
problems if the U.S. would not provide support,'' he told The
Associated Press in an interview Sunday.
   Washington sent El Salvador almost $600 million in military and
economic aid last year, tops in the Western hemisphere.
   In Washington, the State Department hailed El Salvador's
national elections and called them a strong victory for the
democratic process.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, an Indiana Repblican who led an observer
team named by President Reagan, called the election honest and
important ``because power transferred peacefully'' and ``the rebels
didn't win.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman was asked whether the
United States had reservations about the rightist victory.
   ``Our basic policy is that we don't choose sides in these kinds
of elections,'' Redman said.
   Arena benefited from a huge groundswell of popular discontent
with the Christian Democrats. Duarte defeated d'Aubuisson for the
presidency in 1984 on a platform that promised to end the war and
improve the average Salvadoran's lot.
   But the war continues, unemployment is estimated at 40 percent
and inflation is about 40 percent annually.
   Cristiani said Sunday night his party would not present what he
termed ``a systematic and capricious opposition'' to Duarte in the
new assembly.
   ``We are not going to make war on Duarte,'' he added, apparently
trying to dispel speculation that Arena would do everything
possible to make the Christian Democrats' life impossible with an
eye to winning the 1989 presidential election.
   Cristiani said he and his party would try to reach agreement on
fundamental points, including how to wage the war, with all parties
represented in the legislature.
   ``If the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make
them, which will be the result of a national consensus, they do not
leave any other way out but a military solution,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential contender Bob Dole,
trailing George Bush in Wisconsin as well as nationally, challenged
Bush anew to a debate on Monday and won applause from a farm crowd
for his proposal to freeze most federal spending.
   Later, in Eau Claire, Dole called for stiffer penalties for drug
dealers, including capital punishment.
   ``If that person is tried and convicted and found guilty, I
can't think of any penalty that's severe enough _ including the
death penalty,'' Dole said. ``We've got to set an example. We've
got to stop it. We're not going to do it by just a slap on the
wrist.''
   Vern Peterson, acting mayor of Amery, a farm community in
northwestwern Wisconsin, said during Dole's appearance that he
would send a debate invitation to Bush this week ``and of course
you, Mr. Dole, are invited.''
   ``I'll be here. In fact, maybe I'll just stay here,'' said Dole,
who has unsuccessfully pressed Bush for a one-on-one debate for
weeks.
   Bush is far ahead of Dole in the race for the Republican
nomination. And a poll published Sunday in The Milwaukee Journal
showed the vice president leading Dole by nearly 3-to-1 among
Wisconsin voters likely to vote in Wisconsin's April 5 primary.
   Dole's remarks about his proposed spending freeze drew cheers
from more than 900 farmers who packed a small barn to hear him
speak during Farm City Days.
   Dole said his deficit-reduction plan would allow ``no
exceptions, except some things for low-income Americans.''
   ``That one-year freeze will save $150 billion over three years,
no taxes, no gimmicks, no phony accounting, just $150 billion in
real savings,'' Dole said.
   He said the freeze would give him time to negotiate a budget
deficit reduction plan that would provide a lasting solution to the
problem of rising federal red ink.
   On another topic, in an interview after he toured the festival
grounds, Dole said he thought a newly proposed aid plan for
Nicaragua's Contra rebels could pass the Senate if brought to a
vote, ``but the big question is whether it can be brought to a vote
in the Senate.''
   Dole said that although Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson has
endorsed Bush, the Republican governor is a good example of a
lawmaker who makes a good executive.
   ``My opponent says Bob Dole is a good opponent but he doesn't
have any executive experience. Governor Thompson had 20 years of
experience in the Legislature and now he's governor and he's doing
a good job of saving you money because he can go back and deal with
the legislators he knows,'' Dole said. ``I can do the same.''

<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization on
Monday defied a U.S. order to shut down its U.N. observer mission
and Washington prepared to take legal action to close it.
   The General Assembly, meeting in its second emergency session on
the dispute, was expected to urge Washington to desist from its
efforts to close the mission.
   Diplomats said the assembly also would request U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to take legal action if
necessary to protect the PLO mission and provide alternative
accommodations to its members on U.N. international territory.
   The 1987 Anti-Terrorist Act passed by Congress went into effect
Monday. It requires the government to close the PLO mission, whose
offices are in a townhouse in New York City.
   Zehdi Labib Terzi, the PLO's permanent representative to the
U.N., said he would not voluntarily close the 13-year-old mission
near Park Avenue as ordered by Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   ``Once we see what the U.S. government does, then we will
respond,'' Terzi said.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Mark Sheehan said in
a telephone interview that the government probably would file suit
Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York City seeking a court
order to close the mission.
   ``We will lay out our belief that continued operation of the PLO
U.N. observer mission is in violation of the law passed by Congress
and ask the court to agree and issue an order directing him (Terzi)
to close down,'' Sheehan said.
   He said he did not expect an immediate ruling by the court, and
the PLO probably would have at least 20 days to file a response to
the civil suit.
   In a message to Terzi on March 11, Meese said if the mission was
not closed voluntarily by March 21, the PLO would be in violation
of the law and a suit would be filed.
   A source at the United States' U.N. mission, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said if a court rules against the PLO, the
government might try to render the PLO mission ineffective by
turning off electricity and water.
   PLO officials have said repeatedly the dispute is between the
United States and the United Nations, not between Washington and
the PLO.
   The United Nations and the PLO say the 1987 Anti-Terrorist Act
violates the 1947 U.N. Headquarters Treaty, by which the United
States agreed to allow all U.N. missions to operate.
   The PLO was granted observer status by the 159-member world
body, which considers the organization the only legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people. The PLO participates in
U.N. debates on the Middle East but does not have the right to vote.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the PLO's legal
counsel, has said that if the United States sues to close the PLO
mission, he would seek to have the complaint dismissed on grounds
the United States lacks jurisdiction.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy played with a loaded
anti-tank weapon for a day and a half, thinking it was a toy
bazooka, but never figured out how to fire the rocket, authorities
said Monday.
   Weapons experts detonated the 66mm armor-piercing rocket round
on Sunday at a local gun club after the boy's father alerted police.
   The Vietnam War-era weapon has a range of more than 1,000 yards
and the projectile can pierce more than 6 inches of steel,
officials said.
   Had Dennis Grigg, fired the weapon, it could have exploded in
his face because the propellant in the projectile had leaked out,
said Chief Deputy Chris Kratzer of the Sangamon County Sheriff's
Department.
   But the boy never figured out how to operate the weapon.
   Investigators tried to unravel conflicting accounts about how
the boy obtained the weapon, while the Army attempted to find out
where the device came from by tracing the control numbers on the
launcher and projectile, Kratzer said.
   The boy's father, David Grigg, said he was working on a car
Sunday afternoon when he saw his son pointing the weapon at him.
Grigg looked down the barrel, saw something inside and called the
sheriff's office.
   The boy told police that he got the weapon from a friend who
found it in his father's pickup truck, but the man mentioned by the
boy denied involvement, Kratzer said.

Confusion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Party officials and even Jesse
Jackson's campaign staff were at a loss Monday to explain why he
beat Michael Dukakis, Albert Gore, Jr. and other rivals in a
primary-day Democratic straw poll.
   Among the Republicans, Vice President George Bush prevailed in
his party's primary Sunday in an atmosphere of confusion in which
most polling stations did not have ballots and few Republicans
voted. Bush garnered all 14 national convention delegates.
   ``You all stood in there and got the job done,'' Bush told
supporters in a telephone call Monday from Air Force Two as he
traveled between campaign stops in the Northeast.
   ``I have no idea'' why Jackson won, said Miguel Hernandez
Agosto, a leader of the Popular Democratic Party slate of delegates
who will travel to the July presidential nominating convention in
Atlanta.
   Jackson never visited this island 1,000 miles southeast of
Florida, and never allowed himself to be pinned down on its main
political interest _ should Puerto Rico remain a U.S. commonwealth
or become the 51st state.
   Asked why he thought Jackson won, press aide Tom Schade said in
a telephone interview from Jackson's headquarters in Chicago, ``I
don't have an answer for that.''
   Jackson's victory may or may not help him at the Democratic
National Convention. Puerto Rico's 56-member delegation is going
uncommitted, as Hernandez Agosto and Gov. Raphael Henandez Colon
stressed after Sunday's balloting.
   The straw poll was ``merely an expression of affection and good
wishes for the candidates,'' Hernandez Agosto said Monday. ``It
does not commit the delegates in any way. Each member of the
delegation is aware of that.''
   Gov. Hernandez Colon said, ``At this time, we have not made a
decision on which U.S. presidential candidate we are going to
support.''
   The latest unofficial results showed that with 1,494 of 1,650
precincts reporting, or 91 percent, Jackson had 87,757 votes, or 32
percent, to 70,733 votes, or 26 percent, for Dukakis, and 57,639
votes, or 21 percent, for Illinois Sen. Paul Simon.
   Simon made one campaign trip here, as did Dukakis. The
Massachusetts governor also sent a videotaped speech to PDP
delegates, in Spanish, noting he honeymooned in Puerto Rico.
   Among other Democrats, Tennessee Sen. Gore finished fourth with
45,361 votes, or 17 percent, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, fifth
with 9,159 votes, or 3 percent, and Lyndon LaRouche last with 3,753
votes, or 1 percent.
   Bush swamped Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, 1,935 votes to 48, or 98
percent to 2 percent, according to the latest unofficial results
with 582 of 1,650 stations reporting, apparently just 35 percent.
   Dole backers tried up to the last to call off the primary and
allocate the 14 GOP delegates by caucus.
   On Sunday, GOP ballots and election material sat unused in
trucks because no one came to distribute them to precinct stations.
Local party chairman Luis Ferre, expecting a very low turnout,
approved a plan Sunday morning whereby 1,650 polling stations were
consolidated to 104.
   The State Election Commission, which conducted the election, was
not consulted about the maneuver and on Monday was unsure how to
tally Republican votes. The consolidation might mean that Bush's
1,935 votes represent much more than 35 percent of all GOP votes
cast.
   ``Dole had no following here,'' Ferre said. ``His supporters
tried to stop the primary'' because they knew that otherwise, Dole
had no chance of defeating Bush.
   On the Democratic side, 33 delegates were selected. Those 33
will choose 18 more. The remaining five seats in the delegation
automatically go to party officials such as Gov. Hernandez Colon.
   The main issue was not Simon's advocacy of statehood for this
Caribbean island of 3.5 million, or Gore's defense of tax breaks
that generate jobs here, or Dukakis' position that federal minimum
wage laws be applied here. The main issue was control of the local
Democratic Party.
   The party currently is split exactly in half _ the Popular
Democratic Party of Gov. Hernandez Colon and the rival New
Progressive Party of ex-Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo each has its own
chairman, vice chairman and national committeeman and
committeewoman.
   The entire 33-member PDP delegate slate won Sunday, 373,950 to
297,408, giving Hernandez Colon an island-wide base to press for
federal patronage, legislation and the political status quo whereby
Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens with almost every right and
obligation except they cannot vote for president and pay no federal
taxes.
   The NPP favors statehood for Puerto Rico.

   Democratic presidential contender Jesse Jackson
pledged Monday to bring an end to apartheid in South Africa if
elected.
   Jackson, speaking at a Denver high school, was asked whether he
supported a protest by University of Colorado students against the
university's investment with a company that has South Africa
holdings.
   ``I support the ambition of those students,'' said Jackson. ``A
university must maintain a moral integrity and should not invest''
in South Africa.
   Broadening his statements to include U.S. policy toward South
Africa, Jackson said, ``It doesn't make much sense to mine harbors
in Nicaragua and send troops to Honduras in the name of open and
free elections and then say nothing when South Africa locks up
labor leaders and kills innocent men, women and children.''
   ``The integrity of our nation is at stake,'' he said.
   Jackson said pressure and sanctions by the United States and its
allies could end apartheid.
   ``The sure way to end apartheid in South Africa is to elect
Jesse Jackson president,'' he said.
   Jackson, who has made anti-drug comments a part of most campaign
appearances, exhorted the students at George Washington High School
to stay away from drugs.
   He also urged the students to participate in Colorado's precinct
caucuses April 4, noting that they coincide with the 20th
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination.
   ``Since Gary Hart is not in the race, let me be Colorado's
favorite son,'' said Jackson, who later met briefly with Hart at
Stapleton International Airport. Hart withdrew from the
presidential race for the second time March 11.
   ``I have appealed to him (Hart) for help in our campaign to give
assistance in the direction of policy development, and he will help
do so,'' Jackson told reporters after meeting with Hart.
   Hart said this did not mean he was endorsing Jackson. ``Direct
endorsements are old-fashioned,'' he said. ``I can't deliver any
votes to Jesse.''
   But he said he was willing to work with Jackson _ or any
Democratic candidate _ on policy matters.
   ``I think the best assistance I can give him or any other
candidate for president is in the area of policies,'' said Hart.
``I want to work very closely with Jesse and his people to help him
develop a policy to govern this country.''

   Former ``Falcon Crest'' siren Morgan
Fairchild is making another name for herself in the muddy waters of
Democratic politics.
   Not content to just raise funds for Democratic causes and
candidates, Ms. Fairchild took on a new role as a delegate at the
state party convention over the weekend.
   ``If you're an actor who has made up your mind about a
presidential candidate, you're asked to go to Iowa, go on national
television and tell everybody why you support the candidate,'' she
said. ``So if you are seriously involved, you have to be willing to
make that commitment and know what you're talking about.''
   But the blond, blue-eyed femme fatale is hardly ready to run for
office herself.
   ``It's the last thing I would think of,'' she said. ``My
contribution right now is in trying to raise funds. People don't
need me to give a speech.''
   Miss Fairchild is undecided on which presidential candidate to
support, said one of her publicists, Rachel Vizcarra. ``She just
hasn't made up her mind yet.''
   During the weekend convention, delegates selected candidates for
backing in local races in the June primary.

   A U.S. military helicopter crashed
Monday during a training exercise near the Honduran town of
Juticalpa and all 10 American soldiers aboard were injured, U.S.
officials reported.
   Maj. Gary Hovatter, spokesman for the American forces sent to
Honduras last week, said the UH-1 Huey helicopter went down at
about 1 p.m. EST and he called the crash an accident.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Mel Sundin said
there were 10 people aboard the helicopter, not nine as previously
thought. Their injuries did not appear to be serious.
   ``All are in good to excellent condition,'' Sundin said. He
added that those aboard the chopper were American soldiers, but did
not have further details.
   Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said earlier that
there were no reports of fatalities. She said other helicopters
evacuated the victims for medical treatment but it was not clear
where they were taken.
   One Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the cause of the crash appeared to be mechanical.
   Hovatter said the helicopter was taking part in an exercise
called ``Golden Pheasant,'' which was launched after 3,200 U.S.
soldiers arrived in Honduras last week.
   President Reagan sent the troops as a warning to Nicaragua after
U.S. and Honduran officials said Nicaraguan soldiers crossed into
Honduras to attack base camps of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels.
   Neither Hovatter nor LaLuntas gave further information on the
injured soldiers because the victims' relatives had not yet been
notified.
   The officers said the helicopter crashed about six miles south
of Juticalpa. The area is 35 miles north of the Honduras-Nicaragua
border and about 60 miles west of the region where Nicaraguan
troops battled the rebels last week.
   The troops sent to Honduras were from the 82d Airborne Division
based at Fort Bragg, N.C., and the 7th Light Infantry from Fort
Ord, Calif.
   All aboard the helicopter were from the 82nd Airborne, Chip
Barkley, a spokesman with the American Embassy in Tegucigalpa, told
Raleigh radio station WPTF-AM.
   But Pentagon sources said the helicopter that crashed apparently
was assigned to U.S. forces in Panama and was not airlifted to
Honduras by the airborne division.
   The Reagan administration has said the troops were not sent to
combat against Nicaragua's Sandinista army. Administration sources
said Monday it appeared the fighting was ending and the Sandinistas
were withdrawing from Honduran territory.
   The Pentagon maintains a force of about 1,100 military personnel
in Honduras as part of Joint Task Force Bravo to oversee training
exercises in the Central American country.
   The UH-1 helicopter is a single-engine transport craft.

   Deceptive marketing by Bell of
Pennsylvania results in many customers paying for optional
telephone services they don't want or need, state officials charged
Monday.
   In a joint announcement, Attorney General LeRoy Zimmerman and
Consumer Advocate David Barasch said Bell has been engaged in a
longstanding sales practice that misleads customers about service
options. In some cases, they said, lower-income residents were
saddled with costly extras.
   The attorney general and consumer advocate filed separate but
related legal actions to restrain Bell from using the allegedly
illegal marketing practices, to make refunds to customers and to
pay civil penalties.
   ``In many cases, Bell representatives assign services such as
call waiting and wire maintenance plans without ever telling the
consumer that the services are optional,'' Zimmerman said during a
news conference.
   Bell, the state's largest telephone company, said the
allegations were unjustified and ``an affront'' to its employees.
   Regis F. Filtz, Bell vice president and chief operating officer,
said company representatives often spend a half-hour or an hour
with customers to ensure they make informed choices.
   ``Certainly we sell. But we have no interest in overselling, or
selling services by misleading customers as to the cost, value or
benefits of our services,'' Filtz said.
   Bell serves about 3.7 million customers, representing about 80
percent of the state's telephone lines.
   Barasch said consumers have spent about $176 million on Bell's
optional services since 1984. But he was unable to determine how
many customers may have been mislead about the charges. Optional
services include Touch-Tone service, call forwarding, call waiting,
three-way calling and speed calling.
   The allegations were based on 32 test calls made to Bell
representatives by agents posing as customers.
   In one test call, an agent identifying herself as a single
mother living on welfare was assigned a package of services costing
$28.55 monthly, when basic phone service could be obtained for
$6.65 per month, officials said.
   Of the callers, more than 70 percent were assigned up to three
optional services they had not requested or were not told were
optional, officials said. Three-quarters of the callers were
assigned Touch-Tone service without requesting it or without being
told it was optional, they said.
   In a complaint filed with the Public Utility Commission, Barasch
labeled the sales practices ``unlawful, unfair and deceptive.''
Besides the penalties and refunds, Barasch also asks the commission
to force the company to set up new procedures for initiating and
re-establishing service.
   Zimmerman, in a suit filed in Commonwealth Court, asks that the
company be assessed civil penalties for violating
consumer-protection laws.
   Barasch estimated the company would have to pay ``many millions
of dollars'' in refunds and fines.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz opened
wide-ranging talks Monday in which he intends to confront visiting
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze about massive Soviet
arms shipments to Central America.
   They met for 90 minutes to set their agenda for the next two
days. Also, Shevardnadze told reporters, he had ``a very general
review of the international situation'' with Shultz.
   The dispute over Central America appeared unlikely to spoil
progress in efforts to reduce U.S. and Soviet nuclear arms or
preparations for the next superpower summit meeting in Moscow.
   Shevardnadze was expected to offer a late-May summit date and to
have it accepted by President Reagan after they meet Wednesday at
the White House.
   The Soviet foreign minister called his first session with Shultz
``organizational.'' Asked if a date for the summit would be set
during his visit, Shevardnadze said, ``I think so.''
   A treaty to slash U.S. and Soviet armories of long-range nuclear
arms by 30 percent to 50 percent is the projected centerpiece of
Reagan's fourth meeting with General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   While Shultz said Sunday the agreement was not yet ``in the
bag,'' U.S. and Soviet experts will try to square drafts of their
treaty proposals during Shevardnadze's three-day visit.
   But the wars in Nicaragua and Afghanistan cast a cloud on the
pre-summit preprarations.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway and State
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman accused Moscow of an
unceasing supply of weapons to the leftist government in Nicaragua.
   Apparently referring also to the reported supply of Soviet
rifles and other arms to embattled Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega from Cuba, Ms. Ridgway said: ``What we need now is
an end to the continued Soviet provision of these high levels of
military equipment.''
   Redman, meanwhile, accused the Soviets of shipping more than
3,000 tons of equipment to Nicaragua in January and February alone.
   For a number of years, the Soviets have supplied Nicaragua with
$500 million to $600 million in assistance annually, he said. ``I
certainly don't see it as an issue heating up,'' Redman said, but
Soviet military support is a ``continuing cause for concern.''
   In Afghanistan, meanwhile, the United States has been arming
rebels fighting a Marxist government backed by an estimated 120,000
Soviet troops and weapons.
   The United States is demanding the Soviets withdraw the troops
and also end the aid. Negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan
reached an impasse last week, but Shultz evidently was not prepared
to seek a compromise solution with Shevardnadze.
   ``They're the ones who got into Afghanistan and the ones who
have to figure out how they are going to get out,'' Ms. Ridgway
said.
   Reagan, at a White House ceremony to sign an Afghanistan Day
proclamation approved by Congress, said:
   ``We may be approaching an historic moment. We all hope that
what we hear from Moscow means there will be a complete and
irreversible withdrawal of all the Soviet forces from Afghanistan,
that the Afghan people will be able to freely determine their own
future, and that the millions of refugees can return to their homes
with dignity.''
   Shultz's first session with Shevardnadze dealt primarily with
setting an agenda for their talks on Tuesday and Wednesday. They
will take up four main issues: arms control, human rights, regional
disputes and U.S.-Soviet relations generally.
   That is the traditional lineup for what has become monthly
meetings between Shultz and Shevardnadze, alternating between
Washington and Moscow.
   But in a novel break with tradition, instead of scheduling a
formal dinner Tuesday night, Shultz arranged a buffet at the State
Department _ simultaneously with the showing in the Ben Franklin
reception room of the movie, ``That's Entertainment.''
   And Tuesday morning, a new ``risk-reduction'' center will be
opened at the State Department to provide quicker communication
between the two capitals in order to avoid accidental nuclear war.
   A formal agreement was signed here last September. A center is
being established in Moscow, as well.
   Satellite links will transmit information between the two
capitals, augmenting an existing telecommunications hotline.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas in south Lebanon made one of
their biggest assaults of the year before dawn Monday, attacking
six positions manned by Israeli-backed militiamen, a U.N. spokesman
said.
   There was no immediate report on casualties and it was not clear
which faction was involved. It was the second battle between
anti-Israel guerrillas and the South Lebanon Army reported in three
days.
   Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attackers fired machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades into
militia positions in the central sector of Israel's self-proclaimed
``security zone'' just north of the border.
   The mainly Christian militia, which is financed by Israel and
acts as its surrogate, retaliated with mortars and tank cannon.
   Timur Goksel, the U.N. spokesman, said several positions manned
by Irish troops of the U.N. peacekeeping force were caught in the
crossfire but reported no casualties.
   ``There was very heavy shooting in the area,'' he said. ``Seven
Irish battalion posts were caught in the crossfire.''
   Sources said Israeli soldiers rushed to the militia's aid in
Qantara, Shoumariyeh, Rashaf, Haddata, Beit Yahoun and Braachit, a
string of villages 13 miles southeast of Tyre, and opened up on the
raiders with tank cannons.
   The fighting lasted for two hours and the attackers withdrew,
the sources said, speaking privately.
   Militiamen and Israeli gunners later shelled the Shiite Moslem
market town of Nabatiyek. Two Lebanese women were reported wounded.
   Monday's hostilities came two days after Israeli troops and
South Lebanon Army militiamen, led by tanks, raided guerrilla bases
four miles northeast of the security zone.
   Israeli fighter-bombers raided a Palestinian guerrilla camp in
the Chouf Mountains southeast of Beirut last Thursday, killing one
guerrilla.

   A Canadian-Soviet research team has completed
nearly a fifth of its 1,100-mile trek across the Arctic with only
the anticipated problems like frostbite and blisters, its
spokeswoman said Monday.
   The 13 Soviet and Canadian team members skied 13 miles Monday,
Shirley Smyth said by telephone from Ottawa. She said the team
covered 16 miles Sunday, its greatest single-day distance, in minus
33 cold.
   Using an angle-measuring device called a theodolite, which
resembles a surveyor's transit, scientists are trying to find a
second magnetic pole on their journey over untrodden territory.
   She said a Canadian and Soviet doctor on the 3-week-old
expedition are treating team members for frostbite and blisters.
   Team members took a two-day break last week to begin scientific
tests and repair broken equipment. They also varied their steady
diet of dried-meat known as pemmican with fruit, eggs and steak.
   ``They could have a bit of a picnic,'' said Smyth. ``It was a
break from pemmican.''
   She said relations between Canadians and Soviets were warm and
spirits high.
   The expedition left the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, the
northernmost point in the Soviet Union, to ski and walk to the
North Pole. The three-month journey will end in Canada at Cape
Columbia on Ellesmere Island.

week when their ships dock, Navy officials said as law officers in
the surrounding areas made plans to bolster their forces.
   ``We're going to have to have more law enforcement,'' said J.P.
Luby, a county commissioner whose district includes nearly 20 miles
of public beaches.
   ``We want the spring breakers to have a good time, but things
should be worked out so that we have a better understanding of the
problems,'' he said.
   Over the weekend, eight spring break revelers were arrested
following a late-night riot, four stabbings and several drunken
driving incidents. Two San Antonio men were killed when their car
crashed through a flashing barrier and plunged off a ferry dock,
sinking in 20 to 25 feet of water.
   ``We had 35 units patrolling the area of Port Aransas and the
Padre Island National Seashore. But at night, there are not as many
to go around,'' Luby said. ``The Department of Public Safety had 18
officers out and that wasn't enough.''
   Luby said he and constables, police and emergency workers met
two weeks ago to prepare for the onslaught of college students
converging on Corpus Christi-area beaches.
   But no one was prepared for the fracas that erupted Saturday
night on nearby Mustang Island, he said.
   The melee erupted shortly before midnight when a motorist struck
a 16-year-old girl on the beach and then attempted to leave, said
Police Chief Don Perkins. Angry youths began to attack the driver,
but he was pulled away by police.
   The mob tipped over his car, smashed in the windows and set it
and a nearby portable toilet afire, police said.
   Police estimated there were 3,000 rioters and about 100 officers
on hand. Officials used tear gas and helicopters with search lights
to quell the uproar.
   Two law enforcement officers were injured in the melee. Four
people were stabbed in unrelated attacks, police said.
   ``The real problem is we have 21{ miles of beach in Nueces
County and Port Aransas has 3 miles and everyone congregates in an
area of about 1{ to 2 miles of beach,'' Luby said. ``You've got too
many people in a small area.''
   Authorities said it was calm along the beach Monday.
   Still, there is one more weekend of large crowds expected for
spring break before the Easter weekend, when more tourists are
expected.
   In Galveston, 230 miles to the northeast of here, officials say
1,650 sailors from the USS Lexington and two other Navy ships will
be mixing with the students.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Jim Fallon in Dallas said the training vessel
USS Lexington, the submarine rescue platform ship USS Petrel and a
research submarine will be berthed at Galveston on Tuesday through
Friday.
   Many of the sailors who serve aboard the ships will get shore
leave during the visit, he said. He estimated about 1,000 sailors
will be off the ships at one time.

<HEAD>World Bank Seeks $420 Million from US to Boost Third World Lending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank is asking its 151 member
governments for an additional $2.24 billion in cash, including $420
million from the United States, in order to raise lending to poor
countries, the bank's president said Monday.
   The bank now lends about $14 billion a year at current rates of
interest, though for much longer periods than commercial banks
usually do. It lends an additional $3 billion annually on even
easier terms to the poorest countries.
   The new cash represents 3 percent of the bank's recently
announced $74.8 billion increase in capital, which has been
approved by the member governments. The rest of the money would be
on call in case the bank fell short of funds. But it has never had
to use any of its ``on call'' money in more than 40 years of
operations.
   The United States is being asked for the biggest single share of
the new capital increase: $14 billion, of which $420 million would
be in cash and the rest on call. Because the cash would be spread
out over five or six years, the administration is now asking
Congress for a first $70 million.
   ``But as a former congressman who well remembers Senator Everett
Dirksen`s description of the appropriations process as `a billion
dollars here, a billion dollars there, and pretty soon you're
talking about real money,' I do not expect or want automatic
approval of this capital increase,'' said bank President, Barber B.
Conable, a former Republican congressman from New York.
   Conable said that as needs have grown in the Third World,
resources to meet them have not kept pace.
   He noted that in the previous five years there had been a flow
of $65 billion from the industrial countries to the poor ones.
   ``The reversal amounts to a crisis for development, one that
puts a duty on the World Bank to be even more vigorous as an honest
broker between rich and poor...,'' he said.
   Conable's speech was prepared for delivery in San Francisco to
the World Affairs Council of Northern California. Copies were
distributed to reporters by the bank's headquarters in Washington.

<HEAD>Comedian Bob Hope Has Surgery For Benign Prostate Condition,
Publicist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Bob Hope underwent surgery Monday
for what was described as a ``benign condition'' of his prostate
gland, his publicist said.
   The 84-year-old comedian ``does not have cancer,'' said
spokesman Jim Mahoney after the surgery.
   Hope was operated on at the USC Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer
Hospital, but Mahoney explained that Hope was at the facility
because he had been referred to Dr. Donald G. Skinner, chief of
urology at USC who performs his operations at the cancer hospital.
   Skinner said Hope was in ``excellent'' condition after the
operation.
   Mahoney said the comedian is expected to be hospitalized for
three or four days. The operation was scheduled in advance, not
emergency surgery, he said.
   Last week, the comedian was one of the presenters at the Writers
Guild of America awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. He chatted
with reporters and photographers there, but didn't mention the
surgery.
   Mahoney said the operation, common for older men, was similar to
a procedure performed on President Reagan in January 1987. The
surgeon removed fibrous tissue filling the prostate, using small
instruments and working through a catheter.

   The 3,200 U.S. troops rushed here
after an alleged incursion by Nicaraguan troops will begin a set of
joint maneuvers with the Honduran army Tuesday, a U.S. military
spokesman said.
   Maj. Gary Hovatter, spokesman for the American forces in
Honduras, made the announcement Monday but refused to disclose
details.
   The announcement came as Nicaragua's Sandinista government and
Contra rebels agreed to halt all offensive military operations
during three days of talks that began Monday. The negotiations are
to achieve a permanent cease-fire.
   U.S. troops arrived in Honduras last week at the request of
President Jose Azcona Hoyo and are stationed at five bases
throughout Honduras. The soldiers are from the 82nd Airborne
Division based in Fort Bragg, N.C. and the 7th Light Infantry
Division from Fort Ord, Calif.
   In an exercise Monday, a U.S. helicopter crashed near a base in
the southern town of Juticalpa with 10 people aboard. Hovatter said
there were injuries but would not give further information until
relatives are notified. Pentagon spokesmen in Washington said there
were no fatalities and that the injuries did not appear serious.
   Some of the U.S. soldiers are based at Jamastran, about 20 miles
from the Nicaraguan border, but 80 miles from the site of the
alleged Nicaraguan incursion at the Bocay region in the Honduran
province of Olancho. The Bocay area straddles the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   Others are at Tamara and at San Lorenzo in southern Honduras,
and a corps of about 200 soldiers remained at American military
headquarters at the Honduran air force base of Palmerola, about 45
miles northwest of Tegucigalpa.
   President Reagan dispatched the troops both as a show of support
for Honduras and as a warning to Nicaragua against further action
in the area.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua repeatedly has denied his
country's troops were inside Honduras. The Contras maintain supply
and staging camps in Bocay region.
   Honduran presidential spokesman Lisandro Quesada said Monday the
estimated 2,000 Sandinista troops who entered this country last
week in pursuit of Contra rebels have dwindled.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, the Honduran armed forces public
relations director, said it will be ``days only'' before the U.S.
troops return home.
   Neither Suarez nor Quesada would say the threat from the
Sandinistas has ended.
   ``When the last Sandinista crosses the Segovia River into
Nicaragua then this subject will be forgotten,'' Quesada said.

<TEXT>
   Riot-ready police moved in quickly Monday,
arresting 225 demonstrators among a yelling crowd of more than 500
people protesting U.S. military presence in Central America.
   At a similar protest in Minneapolis, police arrested about 50 of
several hundred protesters after rocks and paint and paint were
thrown at the Federal Building there and a window was broken.
   In San Francisco, arrests for blocking entrances to the Federal
Building and the streets around it began within minutes of the
start of the protest at 7 a.m. The main entrance was closed, and
for about a half-hour the protesters blocked the rear entrance.
More than 5,000 people work in the 20-story building.
   Shouts of ``No Contra aid'' and ``U.S., CIA, out of Nicaragua,''
filled the air. Some demonstrators, surging from one intersection
to another, hurled newspaper vending boxes and debris into the
street, disrupting traffic.
   On Friday, about 250 people were arrested when they encircled
the Federal Building.
   And on Saturday, at least 5,000 people rallied in the streets.
Bottles, wooden crosses and bags of garbage were thrown at police.
One person was arrested for felony assault on an officer, and four
others were arrested on assorted charges.
   Demonstrations have been held in several U.S. cities since
President Reagan sent 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras last week after
Honduras said 2,000 Sandinistas had crossed the border from
Nicaragua.
   On Monday, officers with visored helmets and batons marched on
the double from one street to another as protesters harassed them
with quick moves. Some protesters went limp and were dragged
screaming to police vans. A young man was hit in the mouth with a
baton and bloodied.
   At times, as many as six police vans and a sheriff's bus lined
up to receive those arrested. They were photographed and booked on
the street before being taken to the Hall of Justice for citations.
   ``We're not going to stop these protests because we want people
to know we are seriously committed to stopping U.S. intervention in
Central America,'' said Bill Nygren, a spokesman for Pledge of
Resistance, one of several groups sponsoring the demonstration.
   The Minneapolis protesters, carrying signs reading, ``Human
rights, not Reagan might'' and ``Stop the killing, Ronnie. Work for
peace now,'' were met by dozens of police carrying night sticks and
wearing protective head gear.
   Officers ripped some banners down and tore them up and used dogs
to keep the streets clear. None of the protesters got inside the
Federal Building.
   The demonstration began at late afternoon when protesters
blocked a busy intersection with their bodies, chanting ``U.S. out
of Honduras.''
   Scores of them faced off against about 30 counter-protesters who
chanted ``More Contra aid,'' but no violence was reported.
   A brief scuffle began when a man who said he was an undercover
police officer grabbed an American flag from a protester and took
it away, saying it was government property.
   Demonstrators burned a flag in a protest Friday.

   A U.N. fact-finding team will leave for
Nicaragua Tuesday to investigate the border violence between
Nicaragua and Honduras, the United Nations announced.
   It said in a statement Monday that the delegation of two
diplomats and two military observers was being sent at the request
of the leftist Sandinista government.
   The statement said the team will visit only Nicaragua since no
permission was received from the Honduran government to observe the
situation on the Honduran side of the border.
   Border violence flared in the mountainous, jungle-covered Bocay
region last week when about 4,500 Nicaraguan troops mounted a major
assault to drive U.S.-backed Contra rebels from Nicaraguan
territory and destroy Contra supply bases on the Honduran side.
   President Reagan sent about 3,200 U.S. troops to Honduras on a
training exercise as a show of support for that government.
   The U.N. observers are Gilberto Schlittler-Silva,
director-designate of the U.N. Division of Security Council
Affairs; Aleksandr Martinovic, political affairs officer in the
office of Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar; and two
Ecuadorean military officers, Maj. Jose Viggiano and Maj. Eduardo
Gorgitano.
   They are to report to Perez de Cuellar upon their return.

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former Du Pont Co. employees
suffering from exposure to asbestos pledged Monday to give 90
percent of a $75 million award in punitive damages to six
institutions.
   William Kapp Jr. of Elkton, Md., one of the victims and
spokesman for the group, said the $67.5 million _ if the damage
award is upheld on appeal _ will be donated ``to try to help our
fellow asbestos victims, as well as to help assure that this kind
of corporate abuse of public trust will never happen again.''
   ``This is just our way of putting the punitive damages award to
its highest purposes,'' Kapp said.
   In November, a Superior Court jury awarded Kapp, 55; James Webb,
74, of Newport; and Joseph Kaster, 71, of the Newport area and
their wives what has been called the second-largest personal injury
award in U.S. history, against Raymark Industries Inc. of Trumbull,
Conn.
   The jury supported claims that Raymark, formerly Raybestos
Manhattan Inc., conspired with the former Johns Manville Corp., now
Manville Corp., to suppress information relating to the health
hazards of asbestos and failing to place warnings on their products.
   Raymark manufactured asbestos that the men worked around for
more than 25 years at Du Pont's Newport plant. Previous state court
rulings had barred liability of employers in such cases.
   In addition to the punitive damage award, the men were awarded
more than $1 million in actual damages for personal injury. They
said they had contracted lung disorders linked to breathing
asbestos fibers. Six co-defendants settled the case.
   There are 350 similar cases pending against Raymark in Delaware.
   The inhalation of asbestos, once commonly used in building
insulation and other products, has been linked to cancer and other
diseases.
   The National Campaign Against Toxic Hazards, a toxic victims
advocacy group, was earmarked to receive $13 million of the $67.5
million.
   The Boston-based group's organizing director Peter Obstler said
the money would be used ``to continue to provide staff and
technical assistance to victims'' of toxic chemicals.
   But Kapp stressed that the money may never be awarded.
   Both sides are awaiting a decision from Judge Clarence W. Taylor
on whether to uphold the award. If it is upheld, Raymark will
appeal, according to LeGrande L. Young, Raymark general counsel.
   Kapp, who employed by Du Pont for 33 years before he became too
ill to work, said he was hoping the move to donate the money to
charity would persuade Taylor to uphold the $75 million award.
   Young said he did not think the judge could be swayed. ``Either
it's an appropriate judgment or it's not,'' he said.
   The other institutions targeted for part of the award at $13
million each are the Mount Sinai School of Environmental Medicine
in New York; the University of Delaware School of Business to
establish a chair to advance the study of business ethics; the
Medical Center of Delaware's Carpenter Clinic for Cancer Research;
and the White Lung Association, a Baltimore-based organization of
asbestos victims.
   An additional $2.5 million was pledged to the Emily P. Bissell
Hospital for the critically ill in Newport.
   The largest jury award is believed to be $127.8 million to an
Orange County, Calif., teen-ager who sued Ford Motor Co. over burns
he received when the gasoline tank of his 1972 Pinto exploded.

   Israeli troopers on Monday shot a Palestinian
teen-ager dead and a PLO leaflet exhorted Arabs to ``shower
soldiers and herds of cowardly settlers'' with stones, firebombs
and iron bars.
   Troops expanded their search for weapons in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip the day after an Arab shot and killed a soldier
in Bethlehem.
   At least 106 Palestinians and the Israeli soldier have been
killed since riots began in the occupied lands Dec. 8, according to
U.N. figures.
   Israeli police arrested a prominent Arab-American attorney
Monday and assailants attacked the homes of two moderate
Palestinians _ a newspaper editor and a member of Jordan's
parliament.
   The army announced a new military law permitting any security
prisoner to be held up to six months with less judicial review than
before. It said the law eliminated the requirement that a military
judge review a case within 96 hours.
   Israeli officials said the measure would apply for six months
and would ease an overload on the military court system, which has
handled nearly 3,000 cases since December. Arab lawyers said they
feared detention without trial could become more common.
   Arabs mounted a general strike Monday in the West Bank and Gaza
to mark the anniversary of a 1968 battle resulting from an Israeli
raid on Palestinian guerrillas inside Jordan.
   Graffiti scrawled on walls overnight urged Arabs to attack
Israeli troops and civilians in memory of the battle at Karameh,
Jordan.
   Protests were reported at more than a dozen sites in the West
Bank and Gaza. Palestinian flags, outlawed by Israel, flew from
utility poles and were raised on mosques.
   An estimated 12,000 Palestinians demonstrated at the Ein
el-Hilweh refugee camp in the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon
to show support for the uprisings in the occupied territories.
   Ein el-Hillweh is the largest refugee camp in Lebanon with about
60,000 inhabitants.
   At Rafah, a seaside town in the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops tried
to restrain protesters by dropping tear gas from helicopters, and
then used live ammunition, Arab witnesses said.
   Soldiers shot Abdel Ahmed Jaber al Mudalal, 17, in the chest and
he died of his wounds, according to the Palestine Press Service and
other Arab reports.
   Army spokesmen confirmed the death but said the family took the
body from Nasser Hospital at Khan Yunis and the cause of death
could not be determined.
   Israeli gunfire wounded 16 Palestinians on Monday, according to
hospital officials and the Arab-run press service, which provided
names and ages. The army said 11 Arabs were wounded.
   Leaflet No. 11, the latest distributed by the Palestine
Liberation Organization, told Arabs to prepare for a long struggle
against the Israelis by developing ``home economy, raising
chickens, rabbits and planting vegetables.''
   It urged Palestinians to ``shower soldiers and herds of cowardly
settlers with stones, firebombs and iron bars'' and designated
March 26 as a day of struggle against Israeli-appointed Arab
municipal officials in the West Bank and Gaza.
   ``The people of the uprising will be severe with anyone who
remains outside the national consensus and refuses to resign
immediately,'' it said.
   Time and Newsweek magazines and the Reuters news agency filed a
suit with the Supreme Court in an effort to recover film
confiscated after Sunday's fatal shooting of Israeli Sgt. Moshe
Katz in Bethlehem. Photographers took pictures moments after Katz
was shot in the head.
   ``Demands for the return of the film made repeatedly to Israeli
authorities have been unavailing, and as a result legal action is
being pursued,'' the magazines said in a statement.
   Military officials said soldiers had widened the search for
illegal weapons since the Katz shooting. The Jerusalem Post quoted
one as saying ``substantial amounts of weaponry'' were in the Gaza
Strip but many caches were in mosques, ``beyond the grasp'' of
Israeli soldiers.
   Army policy prohibits soldiers from entering mosques.
   Jonathan Kuttab, the Arab-American lawyer, was charged with
supporting an illegal organization _ a reference to an art exhibit
at the Hakawati Theater that he said included Palestinian
nationalist work.
   Kuttab, who is the theater's attorney and on its board, called
the charge ``ridiculous and an infringement of the freedom of
artists.'' He was released on bail of 1,000 shekels, or about $750.
   Attackers fired shots at the home and car of Jack Khazmo, a
moderate Palestinian editor who lives in Ram, a village just north
of Jerusalem, and threw three firebombs at the home of Mousa Abu
Ghosh, a member of Jordan's parliament, in the West Bank city of
Ramallah.
   Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and
Egypt in 1967.

<TEXT>
   Gil Evans, a composer, pianist and band leader
considered one of the greatest orchestrators in jazz, has died in
Mexico, his widow said here Monday. He was 75.
   Evans died Sunday in Cuernavaca of peritonitis while
recuperating from prostate surgery, Anita Evans said in New York.
   Evans, who had led his band in a New York City club in December
and January, decided not to return to the club in March but to go
to Mexico to recuperate. Mrs. Evans said that he felt energetic
when he left on the trip and he took his synthesizer and their two
sons, Noah and Miles.
   Evans made his mark in the 1950s and 1960s with innovative
arrangements for trumpeter Miles Davis, particularly three
recordings that showcased Davis' cool style: ``Miles Ahead,''
``Porgy and Bess'' and ``Sketches of Spain.''
   ``They were really among the most brilliant orchestral jazz
records made by anybody,'' said jazz historian and writer Leonard
Feather. ``He made brilliant use of tone colors.''
   Through his spokeswoman, Terry Williams, Davis said: ``Whenever
I had a question about the music, composing or which way to go, I
would think about what Gil would do. I'll really miss him.''
   Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, reached in Los Angeles, said Evans
would be missed ``for keeping time with the age that he's in.''
   ``Whatever new thing, new ideas come up, Gil Evans was right on
top them,'' said Gillespie, who knew Evans well but did not perform
with him. ``He will be missed for having a very strong feeling for
the soloist. He was tender. One of a kind.''
   Evans was born in Toronto May 13, 1912, and grew up in Stockton,
Calif., where he organized a jazz band in high school. His first
professional band, in Stockton, was taken over by Skinnay Ennis,
but Evans stayed on as arranger.
   He was beginning the style that deployed instruments to bring
out richness of tone and textures. He never left jazz as his base,
and his arrangements never conflicted with the sense of spontaneity
vital to jazz.
   After he worked as arranger for the Claude Thornhill Orchestra
during the 1940s, Evans' reputation grew with his work for Davis'
nine-piece band in 1949. He blended French horn and tuba on Davis'
``Boplicity'' and ``Birth of the Cool,'' which proved influential.
   His first recording with his own band, ``The Arranger's Touch,''
used French horn, muted trumpet and bassoon in arrangements marked
by originality. Evans arranged for Davis again in 1959, with Davis
playing flugelhorn over a 19-piece orchestra, on the album ``Miles
Ahead.''
   Evans orchestrated two more Davis albums, ``Porgy and Bess'' and
``Sketches of Spain,'' tailoring them to Davis' artistic
temperament. He worked as a free-lance arranger, doing works like
Cannonball Adderley's ``Pacific Standard Time'' album and his own
``Out of the Cool.''
   A project to arrange for rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix was
canceled by Hendrix's death in 1970. Later, Evans recorded ``Gil
Evans Plays Hendrix.'' He scored the film ``Absolute Beginners'' at
age 74.
   An upcoming tour of northern Europe by the Gil Evans Orchestra,
plus appearances at jazz festivals in Umbria, Italy, and New York
will go on, Mrs. Evans said, with son Miles Evans conducting.
   She said that a memorial service will be held, probably on
Easter.

   The Sandinista government and
U.S.-backed rebels on Monday opened three days of talks in this
border town by exchanging cease-fire proposals and agreeing to a
truce during the negotiations.
   ``Neither side seeks a military victory over the other,'' said
Alfredo Cesar, head of the rebel delegation, after the completion
of the first day of talks _ the first face-to-face negotiations on
Nicaraguan soil.
   He said the Contra rebels proposed a 30-day cease-fire and
continuous talks to reach a permanent truce.
   Cesar told reporters the Contras also proposed total amnesty and
guarantees of free expression to lead toward reconciliation. He
called Monday's talks, which were behind closed doors, ``a step
ahead.''
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, leader of the government
delegation, said he proposed an ``immediate and definitive
cease-fire.'' He did not elaborate.
   The rebels, battered by a two-week-old Sandinista offensive,
agreed to accept a truce for the duration of the negotiations in
what Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros called ``a gesture of good
will.''
   Frank Arana, another Contra spokesman, said the two sides
discussed military and political issues including ``concepts of
democracy.''
   If so, it would be the first time the Sandinistas consented to
discuss political issues with the rebels.
   In two rounds of indirect talks in the Dominican Republic and
Costa Rica, the Sandinistas demanded the negotiations deal
exclusively on the mechanics of a cease-fire.
   Negotiations opened after Ortega, brother of President Daniel
Ortega, said the Sandinistas were suspending military operations
for the duration of the talks and called on the Contras to do the
same.
   Sandinista spokesman Manuel Espinoza said the ``reciprocation of
the Contras'' in agreeing to suspend hostilities and ``the fact
that this meeting is taking place are the first positive steps''
toward a permanent cease-fire. He spoke to reporters during the
lunch break.
   The rebels entered the talks in this small town on the border
with Costa Rica without high expectations of Sandinista concessions.
   Cesar told reporters earlier that he feared the rebels were
being weakened ``by the suspension of United States aid and the
growth in Soviet aid to the Sandinistas.''
   Unlike the two previous rounds of negotiations, the Sapoa agenda
was supposed to be open. On Sunday, however, Sandinista officials
said they would focus on a cease-fire in the civil war, which began
in 1981 and has cost an estimated 40,000 lives.
   Cheering Sandinista supporters calling for a Contra
``surrender'' lined both sides of the 90-mile road the government
delegation traveled from Managua to Sapoa. The Contras arrived from
Costa Rica.
   Soldiers and security agents in plainclothes guarded Sapoa.
Security was especially tight at the customs house, where the talks
were being held.
   With the Sandinista were Brian Wilson, an American pacifist
whose legs were severed by a train in Califoria during a protest
last year, and singer-actor Kris Kristofferson. Both are Sandinista
supporters of long standing.
   The Contras made Cesar, once a high Sandinista official, head of
their delegation in hopes of gaining benefit from his familiarity
with the Sandinistas.
   Cesar said he last visited Sapoa as a Sandinista revolutionary
fighting the late President Anastasio Somoza, who was overthrown in
July 1979.
   ``It has been nine years since I was last in Sapoa and I am
still struggling for the freedom of Nicaragua,'' he said. Cesar
broke with the Sandinistas in 1982.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Nicaragua's Roman Catholic
prelate who mediated earlier talks, and Joao Baena Soares, general
secretary of the Organization of American States, attended the
meeting as observers.
   Cease-fire talks are required under the peace plan signed by the
presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and
Guatemala last August. Among other provisions are amnesties,
greater democracy and an end to the use of one nation's territory
for attacks on another.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's lawyer, in an abrupt
role change, became a witness in his client's impeachment trial
Monday, saying the only political option advisers offered the
governor was ``to go down with the ship.''
   Fred Craft, who was subpoenaed by the Senate on a motion by
Democratic minority leader Sen. Alan Stephens, made the comment
during cross-examination by prosecutor Paul Eckstein.
   Craft and his co-counsel, Jerris Leonard, objected to the
cross-examination, saying that only senators were supposed to
question a lawyer called as a witness under such unusual
circumstances. The presiding officer disagreed.
   Eckstein asked whether Craft ever advised Mecham to resign.
   ``I've talked to the governoer a lot,'' said Craft. ``Sometimes
I've said, `Governor, why are you doiing this to yourself?'''
   Without answering directly, he recalled Mecham advisers
brainstorming about the governor's political options.
   ``We had these meetings and no one could see a political escape
route for the governor,'' Craft said. ``No one was offering the
governor any other political option than to go down with the ship.''
   Craft, now one of Mecham's lawyers in the impeachment case, was
a Washington lobbyist for Mecham and an adviser to the first-term
Republican.
   The Senate, which began its fourth week of inquiry into the
governor's actions Monday, has been hearing testimony on an
allegation that Mecham tried to obstruct justice by thwarting an
attorney general's probe of the alleged death threat against former
Mecham aide Donna Carlson.
   The obstruction of justice charge is one of three broad
allegations against Mecham at the trial. He also is charged with
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan and with misusing $80,000 from
a state fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   Earlier, Craft corroborated Mecham's assertions that he was not
informed that a death threat had been made against a former aide.
   Craft testified he stood next to Mecham when a state police
officer first reported the alleged threat. Craft said it was
reported as ``an altercation between two employees.''
   ``I never heard `felony.' I never heard `death threat' and I
certainly never heard `tampering with a grand jury witness,'''
Craft said in an almost exact duplicate of Mecham's own testimony
last week.
   At the time of the alleged threat last November, Ms. Carlson was
preparing to testify before a grand jury investigating Mecham's
campaign finances.
   Like Mecham, Craft accused Lt. Beau Johnson of the Department of
Public Safety of testifying falsely when he said he alerted Mecham
to a possible felony _ tampering with a grand jury witness.
   Craft swore Johnson never gave that warning.
   ``I don't remember so much what he said as what he did not say
because I'm a trained lawyer ...,'' said Craft. ``If he had said
those words, my antennae would have gone up.'
   Johnson has said he went to Mecham and told him that a Mecham
aide, Lee Watkins, had threatened Mrs. Carlson and that a possible
felony was involved. Mecham has denied this version, saying he
understood two employees had a disagreement and that he referred it
to Watkins' superior, Max Hawkins.
   Senators supported Stephens' motion to have Craft testify
because he was mentioned by other witnesses as participating in key
conversations. Craft said he did not give the governor legal advice
during that period and acknowledged he could not claim an
attorney-client privilege of confidentiality.
   Craft took the stand after Peggy Griffith, he official who
reported hearing the alleged threat against Ms. Carlson, said she
was told Mecham blamed her for getting him ``in hot water.''
   Mrs. Griffith, returning to testify as a prosecution rebuttal
witness, said she was told by her secretary, Terri Fields, that the
governor and his then-lawyer, Murray Miller, were mad at Mrs.
Griffith.
   ``She came in and was very tearful and agitated,'' Mrs. Griffith
said of Ms. Fields. ``She said,`I can't stand it anymore. I'm going
to quit. They're hounding me. The governor and Murray Miller ...
they said it's all your fault, Peggy. They said if you had not
told, the governor would not be in hot water and it's all your
fault.'''
   Mrs. Griffith, a strong Mecham supporter, said that was ``a gut
blow.''
   It would take a two-thirds vote of the 30 senators to convict
Mecham. They could then take another vote and forbid Mecham to ever
hold state office again.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor to be impeached in 60 years,
also faces an April 21 criminal trial on felony charges of
concealing the $350,000 loan and a recall election May 17.
   Mecham, who Friday completed three days of testimony, was absent
from the trial Monday.

   Three men and a teen-ager who ``thought they had
done the right thing'' were charged Monday with manslaughter in the
beating death of a man who allegedly stole $20 and was chased by a
mob in a drug-ravaged neighborhood.
   The four were surprised when told they were being charged in the
death of Raymondo Caraballo, 41, said detective Capt. William
Quigley.
   ``They thought they had done the right thing, chasing and
capturing this guy,'' Quigley said. ``Well, somebody's dead.
Somebody's got to be responsible for it.''
   Three others were being sought and arrests were expected, he
said.
   The killing took place in a section of Spanish Harlem that
residents and area workers described as a drug war zone.
   ``This is Vietnam here. It's bad, it's bad,'' said a city worker
cleaning out a room on the ground floor of the building outside
which Caraballo was beaten. He insisted on anonymity.
   The suspect entered a bakery shortly after noon Sunday and
grabbed $20 from 21-year-old Anna Beteran, witnesses told police.
   ``I heard the people screaming,'' bakery co-owner Orlando Testa
said Monday. ``The guy stole the money from the girl and ran away.''
   As Caraballo ran out, Beteran and her unidentified sister-in-law
chased him, police said. The women lost sight of him when he ducked
into the Jefferson Houses project about a block away, Quigley said.
   As the women asked members of a crowd on the corner if they had
seen the man, Caraballo appeared and the group gave chase.
   ``They started to beat him (with) fists and feet,'' Quigley said
at an afternoon news conference. A garbage can cover was thrown at
Caraballo, but it was deflected and did not hit him, as reported
earlier, Quigley said.
   ``He was getting beaten all over, the legs, the ribs,'' said Al
Rivera, 27, who was visiting a friend in the area of the beating
Sunday.
   ``He was yelling, `Please stop. No more, no more,''' Rivera
said, pointing to the blue scaffolding under which the beating took
place.
   Housing police who were called in broke up the crowd. The man
stood up and was handcuffed, but the officers radioed for an
ambulance as they took him away.
   The man died about five hours later at Mount Sinai Hospital.
Hospital personnel said, according to Quigley, that Caraballo had
irreversible brain trauma and internal injuries. An autopsy was
scheduled.
   Quigley identified the four charged with first- and
second-degree manslaughter as David Andino, 22, Charles Mimms, 20,
Jesus Negron, 23, and Isidore Cuadrado, 14. None knew the man who
was killed or the others arrested, Quigley said.
   Negron was arrested about 10 p.m. Sunday and the other three
surrendered overnight because ``the word was out in the street,''
Quigley said.
   In the neighborhood bodegas, in the housing project and on the
street, the talk Monday was about drugs and robberies and an
exasperating way of life that causes people to live by looking over
their shoulders.
   ``It's frightening. ... It's crazy,'' Julia White, a 16-year
resident and supervisor with the Jefferson Houses Tenants
Association, said about the presence of drug users.
   ``There's no answer to it. And there's no end to it,'' she said,
shaking her head.
   ``Last year, a girl was found killed ...'' she said, hesitating
as he suddenly remembered where: ``In here. Oh, my goodness.''

   King Hussein on Monday urged the Moslem
world to support the revolt in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, where more than 100 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier
have been killed since Dec. 8.
   Opening a meeting of foreign ministers of the 46-member
Organization of Islamic Conference, the Jordanian monarch also
expressed hope that Iran would agree to a cease-fire in its war
with Iraq.
   The Iranian envoy to the conference, Mohammed Ali Tashkiri, told
reporters that his nation would accept the help of any ``truthful
hand'' that tried to end the devastating Iran-Iraq missile duel on
each other's cities.
   At the United Nations Monday, Iraq's U.N. ambassador accused
Iraq of using chemical weapons which he said killed 5,000 people
and wounded 5,000 in Kurdish border cities inside Iran.
   King Hussein told the conference in his opening address: ``The
Palestinian people have a rightful claim on us to support their
uprising both on the national and international level so that the
uprising (in the occupied territories) may bear fruit.''
   The king did not elaborate on what forms aid should take, but
asked the ministers to support an international conference on
Middle East peace.
   Sharifuddin Pir Zadeh, secretary-general of the Islamic
conference, said earlier that protesters in the Israeli-occupied
territories should be supported ``financially and morally.''
   Hussein said the Palestinian were ``heroically fighting for
their freedom and national rights and defying in their uprising the
arrogance of the forces of occupation.''
   He said there should be a seat for the Palestine Liberation
Organization at an international peace conference, which would
involve the parties to the conflict and the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China.
   By calling for a PLO seat at the conference, Hussein set himself
apart from U.S. peace proposals, which he discussed in Amman on
Sunday with U.S. envoy Philip Habib. The U.S. plan does not call
for a PLO seat at the conference.
   ``The uprising of the Palestinian people is not an end in itself
nor is it a transient coincidental event that will soon wither
away,'' Hussein said. ``It is rather an expression of the will of
an entire nation to fight for its freedom and right of
self-determination in its own land.''
   The rebellion in the occupied territories, which Palestinians
call ``the uprising,'' and the Iran-Iraq war dominate the agenda of
the meeting, at which all members of the Conference except Chad are
represented.
   King Hussein, who supports Iraq in the war, called the conflict
a ``deep wound in the body'' of the Moslem world that is ``bleeding
and draining our resources and energies.''
   ``Our hope is that Iran ... will accept Security Council
Resolution 598, which represents the will of the international
community,'' he said.
   The resolution, passed last July, provides for a cease-fire and
return to pre-war borders.
   Iraq has said it will stop shooting if Iran does but the
Iranians demand that Iraq be named the aggressor before a truce
takes effect. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several
border skirmishes.
   Tashkiri, who heads the foreign relations department in Iran's
Ministry of Information and Religious Guidance, told journalists
that he would attempt to get the conference to discuss the missile
duel.
   ``We support a halt in the war of the cities and we will back
any truthful hand that tries to stop it,'' he said.
   The relatively low-ranking level of the Iranian delegation in
Amman appeared to make it unlikely such negotiations would start at
the conference.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, accused Iraq
of sending planes to bombard border cities with nerve gas on a
scale ``unprecedented'' in the Persian Gulf war, and also of
employing mustard gas and cyanide gas in a campaign that began
March 17.
   Iraq's ambassador, Ismat Taha Kittani, refused comment.
   Mahallatti asked the U.N. Security Council to denounce Iraq, to
send a fact-finding team to verify his claims and to mobilize the
World Health Organization and similar agencies to aid victims.

   An explosion Monday near the imperial palace and
another blast close to the Israeli Embassy shattered windows but
caused no injuries and apparently were the work of radicals, said
police.
   A motorcycle rigged as a bomb burst into flames and exploded at
7:17 p.m. near Hibiya Park, about 900 yards southeast of the
imperial palace, breaking windows in the Saudi Arabian Airlines
office, said a police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   About 15 minutes later, explosives in the trunk of a parked car
went off 3{ miles away, near the Israeli Embassy, breaking windows
in buildings nearby, he said. There were no reports of damage at
the embassy.
   The police official said Japanese radicals, who sometimes fire
homemade missiles from cars parked in streets, may have been
responsible for the explosions in downtown Tokyo. No more details
were immediately available.
   In February, four shuttle buses used to transport passengers to
and from airports were burned in Tokyo in apparent attacks by
radicals opposed to expanding the New Tokyo International Airport
at Narita. There were no reports of injuries.
   Narita area farmers and their supporters, including
anti-government radical groups, have resisted plans to expropriate
farmland for a second runway at the $2.5 billion airport at Narita.
   In 1986, radicals fired homemade missiles at the state guest
house, U.S. Embassy, imperial palace, crown prince's residence and
Osaka police headquarters before the seven-nation summit meeeting
held in Tokyo in May.
   One attack occurred during Japan's welcoming ceremonies for the
heads of government of the United States, Canada, Britain, France,
West Germany and Italy.

   IRA gunmen killed a policeman
Monday at a checkpoint in Londonderry, the 12th victim in two weeks
of heightening tension and sectarian violence.
   Britain announced a massive manhunt in West Belfast's Roman
Catholic ghettos for the killers of two British soldiers caught in
an IRA funeral procession.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King said in London that the
Royal Ulster Constabulary has launched an immediate review of its
new policy of keeping a low profile at Irish Republican Army
funerals. The policy was aimed at avoiding clashes between police
and supporters of the outlawed IRA.
   The policeman who was killed Monday, Clive Graham, 25, was shot
in the head in a jeep while at a checkpoint in the Roman Catholic
Creggan district of Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second-largest
city. He died later in the hospital.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for Graham's killing in a
clandestine message to Belfast media.
   He was the 12th person to die since March 6, when British
commandos shot dead three IRA guerrillas who allegedly were
plotting a car bombing in Gibraltar.
   The funeral policy was started Wednesday at services for the
guerrillas killed in Gibraltar. A Protestant gunman opened fire and
hurled grenades at the Catholic Milltown cemetery, killing three
people and wounding 68.
   King's announcement of a review of the policy stopped well short
of demands by leaders of Northern Ireland Protestant parties to
return to a heavy presence at IRA funerals.
   As expectations grew of an imminent wave of arrests in West
Belfast, there was also speculation that dozens of IRA supporters
who were filmed surrounding and beating the soldiers' unmarked car
with iron bars and dragging them out had gone into hiding.
   ``A massive murder investigation is under way in which all
possible resources are involved to identify all those
responsible,'' King said of the manhunt in West Belfast.
   Three people were arrested Saturday and police sources said
Monday that up to 30 others were being sought after hours of
scrutiny of film taken by an army helicopter which hovered over the
scene and by TV networks. Gruesome scenes of the attack also were
shown on television.
   Cpls. Derek Wood and David Howes, in plainclothes, were
surrounded when they drove up to the cortege, dragged from their
car, stripped, beaten and shot dead.
   King said an emergency meeting of senior government ministers
from Britain and the Republic of Ireland will be held this week to
consider stepped up security.
   King denied charges by Northern Ireland Protestant politicians
that police and troops failed to come to the soldiers' aid because
of political orders to stay away from IRA funerals.
   He said it was not immediately clear to police watching film
relayed from the helicopter that soldiers were under attack because
police ``were certain there were no security forces in the area
whatsoever.''
   He said the soldiers were under general orders to keep out of
Catholic districts unless on operational duty and had ``no reason
to be in the vicinity of the funerals.'' He said he did not know
why they were there.
   As the Commons listened in silence, King praised the corporals,
identified as signals corpsmen heading back to barracks after doing
maintenance work at a base in Belfast, for their restraint in
firing only one shot into the mob that surrounded them.
   ``The truth is that there will be new depths (of horror) again
as long as this awful and evil campaign of terrorism and revenge
continues,'' King said.
   ``It has got to stop in the name of humanity and if there is to
be any decent future for the people of Northern Ireland and for all
those living in the island of Ireland, and if the evil shroud of
terrorism is to be lifted from the United Kingdom as whole.''
   Since 1969, 2,638 people have been killed in the sectarian
violence in this Protestant-dominated province. The IRA is fighting
to end British rule and unite Northern Ireland with the Catholic
Republic of Ireland under a leftist administration.

   Warning that Louisiana is in a
``terrifying financial crisis,'' Gov. Buddy Roemer on Monday told
the Legislature that he must have unprecedented authority to make
budget cuts in order to keep the state afloat.
   ``We must build on the foundation of a balanced budget,'' Roemer
said in his address before lawmakers called into special session.
   Although the governor said the first step would be to cut
spending, he said tax increases would be necessary later.
   Roemer said the state faces a more than $2 billion problem,
including a $210 million cash-flow shortage that could shut down
government within 50 days, a projected $756 million deficit for the
1988-89 fiscal year and an accumulated debt of $1.3 billion.
   ``We inherited a mess, a real, unbelievable mess,'' the governor
said.
   Roemer asked lawmakers to give him the authority to cut up to 20
percent from each department and eliminate entire state programs
through the rest of the fiscal year ending June 30.
   ``I must have the power to make decisions and accelerate the
decision-making process,'' he said.
   The governor said that if then-Gov. Edwin Edwards had accepted
$100 million in budget cuts that Roemer proposed during the
transition, the cash-flow problem would have been averted.
   ``Time is eating us alive,'' he said.
   Roemer said the Legislature could reverse any budget decisions
he makes when lawmakers convene for their regular session in April,
adding, ``I am not requesting that you abdicate your responsibility
in the budget process.''
   The special session would center around solving the short-term
cash problem and laying the groundwork for paying off the
accumulated debt. Budget cuts made now will translate into savings
in the next fiscal year, he said.
   As part of a government reorganization plan to save money,
Roemer asked lawmakers to divide the Department of Health and Human
Resources into two agencies, eliminate the Department of Urban and
Community Affairs, and forgive loans taken from ``dedicated,'' or
special-use, funds to keep the state operating.
   Besides eliminating the entire urban affairs department, which
would require separate legislative action, Roemer did not cite
specifically what state programs he wanted to eliminate, but he
said some state institutions may have to be closed.
   Tax increases and borrowing alone, without budget cuts, will not
solve the financial problem and will hamper efforts to attract new
business and industry to Louisiana, Roemer warned.
   ``More borrowing or new taxes are not now the answer,'' he said.
``We will need to do both eventually. But each action must be
carefully thought out and precisely planned.''
   Roemer said his administration already had taken steps to save
$214 million through such steps as better utilization of state
office space, reducing the number of state vehicles by a third,
limiting bond issues for major construction projects and the
elimination of positions held by political appointees.
   The regular legislative session will concern itself with plans
to pay off the long-term debt, an overhaul of the state's tax
system, a balanced budget for 1987-88, education and environmental
changes and a plan to diversify the state's economy, Roemer said.
   The ability to attract new business to Louisiana will depend
upon ``our willingness to make tough decisions,'' the governor said.
   ``I did not expect nor did I ask for this perilous economic
situation. But I am prepared to lead us through these tough times
in such a way that we protect essential services and we avoid
having to make these choices over and over and over again. It will
not be easy,'' he said.
   After the House and Senate convened shortly after 5 p.m.,
administration-backed bills aimed at slashing state spending and
reorganizing government were introduced in both chambers.
   In the House, legislation was put forth to give Roemer the
temporary authority he wants to cut spending.
   There was also a proposal for a statewide lottery to pay off
bonds that would be used to finance the state's accumulated budget
deficit. Once the deficit was paid off, further proceeds would go
to education, health care and local governments, according to the
bill. Roemer has voiced opposition to a lottery.
   Also referred to a Senate committee were bills to transfer the
functions of some agencies to other departments, reduce the
interest rate on some refunds and payments being delayed by the
governor in order to save cash, and abolish most special funds in
the state treasury.

   Officials of the Inter
American Press Association praised the United States on Monday for
progress in press freedom, but criticized Pentagon restrictions on
coverage of some events.
   A Panamanian publisher attending IAPA's mid-year meeting said
drug traffickers have ``hijacked'' his country and there will be no
press freedom there until Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega leaves power.
   Gilberto Arias of the newspaper Extra said the army closed the
three independent daily newspapers and major radio and television
stations ``when they refused to be muzzled.'' The newspapers are
Extra, La Prensa and El Siglo.
   IAPA represents more than 1,300 newspapers in the United States
and Latin America. A special report on press freedom in the
hemisphere is scheduled for release Thursday.
   Anthony Day of the Los Angeles Times reported advances in
Congress and the Supreme Court for the cause of free expression in
the United States.
   But Day criticized Pentagon restrictions on news coverage of
U.S. military operations in the Persian Gulf and Honduras. He is
vice president for the United States of the IAPA Freedom of the
Press Committee.
   Day told the press freedom committee that news coverage has been
limited in the gulf and last week, when the United States sent
3,200 soldiers to Honduras, the Pentagon sent its national media
pool of 10 correspondents with them.
   ``Such pool coverage, though on occasion necessary for swift and
sudden operations, is most unsatisfactory for long-term coverage,
as in the Persian Gulf,'' he said.
   He described as a step in the right direction a new law that
restricts the government's right to refuse entry to foreigners
``because of any past, current or expected beliefs or associations,
which, if engaged in by a U.S. citizen in the United States, would
be protected under the Constitution of the United States.''
   According to Day, IAPA sought the congressional action after the
Immigration and Naturalization Service refused entry to Patricia
Lara, a reporter for El Tiempo in Bogota. The government contended
she was a member of the leftist M-19 guerrillas, which she denied.
   Day said the new law represents progress but the government
still may use reasons of foreign policy or national security to
deny entry to people linked to terrorist actions or activities.
   ``I myself fear that the government might use these exceptions
to keep people arbitrarily out of the country,'' he said. ``It
seems to me that Patricia Lara could still be denied admission
under the law.''
   Another problem with the law is that it applies only for the
remainder of the Reagan administration, he said. Day said IAPA,
mainly through the efforts of Edward Seaton of Seaton Newspapers in
Manhattan, Kan., took the lead in pressing for legislation and
should try to strengthen and extend it.
   Day applauded a Supreme Court ruling in February guaranteeing
``parodists, caricaturists and other amusing rascals'' the same
First Amendment protections ``as the more sober-sided members of
the press have,'' in its ruling on the Rev. Jerry Falwell's damage
suit against Hustler magazine.
   The magazine published a phony advertisement depicting Falwell,
leader of the Moral Majority, in what the court described as a
``drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother.'' It said public
figures have many ways of protecting themselves against vitriolic
criticism and tasteless parodies without suing their critics.
   ``So we in the United States are in debt to Hustler magazine,''
Day said. ``As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court decision is
welcome financially as well as morally. Its decision greatly
inhibits the filing of libel suits.''
   Arias told the committee ``journalists work under constant
threats'' in Panama, where ``there is no freedom of the press and
there won't be until the dicatorship of Gen. Noriega ends.''
   Several foreign journalists have been detained or refused entry
to Panama, where Noriega is the power behind the civilian
government as chief of the 15,000 Defense Forces.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug charges in Florida, the United
States has cut off the flow of cash to his country and the Reagan
administration is trying to force him into exile.
   ``Panama has been hijacked by drug traffickers'' who are capable
of ``shutting down the canal at any moment,'' Arias said.
   ``For a dictatorship accused of drug trafficking, hostile to
humanity, hostile to all democratic and civilized forces, it is not
difficult to sink a ship at the entrance of the Panama Canal.''
   He and other speakers said much of the threat to the press in
Latin America is linked to the region's drug traffic.

<HEAD>State Board To Reconsider Parole Of Former Black Panther</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state board delayed a decision
Monday on whether to parole former Black Panther Johnny Spain, who
earlier this month was freed after 21 years in prison for murder.
   The full state Board of Prison Terms voted unanimously to have
one of its smaller, three-member panels reconsider parole of the
``San Quentin Six'' member, even though he was released from
Vacaville state prison March 10 on court orders that required
$350,000 bail.
   Spain, who lives in San Francisco and is preparing to go to work
as an electrician, a trade he learned behind bars, had been in
prison since December 1966 on a conviction of murdering a man he
was trying to rob in Los Angeles.
   In 1976, he became the only prisoner convicted of murder in an
August 1971 bloodbath at San Quentin prison _ the worst in state
prison history _ that took the lives of militant leader George
Jackson, two other prisoners and three guards.
   The San Quentin conviction was overturned in 1986, and a new
trial ordered, a ruling the state is appealing.
   In February, a three-member panel voted 2-1 to grant parole in
1989 on the 1966 murder charge. The dissenting member, however,
asked the full board to review the decision.
   Earlier this month, however, a Superior Court judge in Los
Angeles, citing technical irregularities in earlier parole
hearings, ordered Spain released on parole immediately.
   That ruling cleared the way for Spain's release on bail pending
the state's appeal of the order for a new trial in the San Quentin
case.
   The parole board's chief legal counsel, William Cashdollar, said
the new hearing would take place within 45 days, in effect
canceling the February ruling to grant parole in 1989.
   Cashdollar refused to provide any further details of their
reasoning during Monday's closed board hearing and said the board
was ``complying fully with court orders but also continuing to
comply with the statutes that establish our responsibilities''
regarding parole of inmates.
   ``It's a unique situation,'' Cashdollar said. ``Most of the
individuals are in custody when we are making our determinations.''
   Spain's attorney, Dennis Riordan, criticized what he called the
board's decision ``to reconsider whether he should have any parole
date at all.''
   Riordan said the board would have to obtain a court order to
enforce any move to return Spain to prison between now and the time
his parole is reconsidered, a move that Riordan said he would fight.
   ``They've never been confronted by this situation before and
they are confused by it,'' he said.
   Board of Prison Terms spokeswoman Phyllis Scott said all options
regarding Spain's immediate future would be discussed with the
state attorney general's office, including the possibility that it
would seek to return him to prison.
   Assistant Attorney General Alan Ashby refused to comment on the
case.

<HEAD>Bush Supports Reagan Veto Of Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS graf 4 to make minor change in wording of remark</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush indicated Monday he
supported President Reagan's veto of a major civil rights bill,
even as the House and Senate were poised to override the
president's action.
   ``The legislation ... is imperfect and the imperfections should
be corrected,'' the vice president, who is seeking the Republican
presidential nomination, said in remarks to a group of black
supporters in Washington.
   Until now, the vice president had avoided direct comment on
whether he supported Reagan's veto. But, as he campaigned in
Hartford, Conn., he told reporters who asked him about it: ``I'm
not going to start differing with the president now.''
   ``I'm not going to start doing now what I haven't been doing for
seven years, finding differences with the president, for whom I
have great respect,'' he told the group in Washington, which
applauded enthusiastically his remarks about the bill.
   The Civil Rights Restoration Act passed both chambers earlier
this year by large margins. Both supporters and opponents of the
measure said there was little chance the veto would be sustained.
   The measure would forbid the distribution of federal funds to
entire institutions, state and local government agencies and many
corporations if any part of them practices discrimination.
   It was prompted by a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that civil rights
laws applied only to a specific program or activity receiving
federal aid. Under the decision, for example, the government could
not cut off money to a college if the discrimination occurred in a
department that did not receive such aid.
   Supporters of the measure say it restores civil rights laws to
the way they were interpreted before the court challenge mounted by
tiny Grove City College in Pennsylvania.
   Bush criticized the measure, but added: ``Having said that,
however, the federal government must require that organizations
that get tax dollars comply with our civil rights laws.''
   He said in Hartford that he believed the president should have
line-item veto powers so he could ``take some of the extremes'' out
of a piece of legislation.
   The Reagan administration has called for an alternative bill
similar to an earlier Republican plan voted down in Congress, which
would grant religious schools and organizations as well as
corporations more exemptions from civil rights laws.
   Earlier Monday, Bush picked up endorsements from Gov. Thomas H.
Kean and New Jersey's county Republican chairmen, a gain that one
chairman said was ``like winning the state's presidential primary.''
   ``We Republicans have had a spirited campaign. We've heard good
ideas, from Jack Kemp, from Bob Dole, from Pete du Pont, from Al
Haig and from Pat Robertson. Now it's time for our party to come
together,'' said Kean with Bush by his side.
   ``George Bush is our leader, and with the Republican vision of a
stronger America that offers opportunity to all regardless of color
or creed, we can not only retain the presidency, but send (House
Speaker) Jim Wright to the back benches for the rest of this
century,'' Kean said.
   The popular governor abandoned his neutrality one week after
Bush won the Illinois primary, taking a commanding lead for the
Republican nomination.
   New Jersey's 21 county Republican chairmen, who had been waiting
for Kean to act, followed the governor's lead and voted to endorse
Bush at a breakfast meeting Monday.
   Kean also campaigned Monday with the vice president in
Connecticut, which holds its presidential primary next Tuesday.
   In Bloomfield, Conn., the vice president, whose father was a
U.S. senator from Conecticut and whose brother and mother still
live in Greenwich, said: ``I don't want to be beaten in this
state.''
   ``We're taking nothing for granted. There's no arrogance factor,
no overconfidence certainly,'' Bush said.
   Bush was also asked about a possible pardon for former national
security adviser John Poindexter and former White House aide Oliver
North, who have been indicted in connection with the Iran-Contra
affair.
   ``Pardon imputes guilt, it seems to me, a pardon for something.
That has not been established,'' the vice president said. ``The
system has to work; it will work.''
   In New Jersey, Assemblyman Richard Kamin, the Morris County GOP
chairman, said the endorsements were ``like winning the state's
presidential primary,'' almost assuring that Bush will win New
Jersey's 64 Republican delegates. The state's primary is June 7.
   ``It is significant to have them at this point, when you have
your opponent still vowing to go on,'' Kamin said.
   In his endorsement speech, Kean cited two themes he has embraced
as governor: the need to improve education and the need for
Republicans to practice the ``politics of inclusion'' by reaching
out to blacks and others not usually in the party's fold.
   The governor said Bush ``wants to be the education president.''
And he said Bush ``doesn't just talk about expanding the Republican
Party; he has been doing it for more than 20 years.''

<HEAD>Drug Charges Added Against Attorney In Lisa Steinberg's Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury has added drug and weapons charges
to the indictment against an attorney charged with murder in the
beating death of a 6-year-old girl he had illegally adopted, a
prosecutor said Monday.
   Officers found heroin, cocaine and marijuana in Joel Steinberg's
Greenwich Village apartment on Nov. 2 when they discovered Lisa
Steinberg comatose and brain dead, Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau said.
   The apartment also contained scales, crack pipes and drug recipe
cards for cocaine and heroin derivatives along with a .45-caliber
revolver and bullets for another weapon, Morgenthau said.
   The child's death touched off a nationwide debate on child abuse
and the role of school and welfare officials in trying to prevent
it.
   A nine-count indictment, which supersedes a November indictment,
also charges that Steinberg abused the girl during the two months
before her death, the prosecutor said. The original indictment
charged him with endangering the welfare of a child on Nov. 2.
   The new abuse charge is a felony. The weapons, drug and
drug-paraphernalia possession charges are misdemeanors.
   Steinberg has been held without bail in protective custody at
Rikers Island. His longtime companion, Hedda Nussbaum, remains at
Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, where she has been undergoing
psychiatric treatment.
   After the girl's death, Ms. Nussbaum, an author and former
children's book editor, was treated for a broken nose, injured eye
and other injuries apparently stemming from a beating.
   She was charged by police in connection with Lisa's death but
has not been indicted. Prosecutors said they would let her receive
treatment before she decides whether to testify before a grand jury.
   Lisa's biological mother, an unwed teen-ager, has testified she
gave her newborn daughter to Steinberg to arrange an adoption. The
lawyer has admitted during a Family Court hearing that he kept the
child without legally adopting her.

   Ralph Boerman is the lucky winner of
an election in which candidates and voters stayed away in droves.
   Boerman, Bob VandenBerg and Earl Thomas got exactly one write-in
vote apiece in the coolly contested March 14 election in Sand Lake,
a northern Kent County village of about 200 people.
   On Monday, three Kent County employees gathered around a box to
see if Boerman, VandenBerg or Thomas would be the next village
trustee.
   VandenBerg's and Thomas' proxies drew slips marked ``Not
Elected.'' Boerman's proxy drew the slip marked ``Elected'' and
Boerman, who like the other candidates didn't attend the draw-off,
became the new trustee of the village north of Grand Rapids.
   The 22-year-old winner, who has never held elective office,
confessed Monday he's got a lot to learn about his new job. He
isn't sure how many people are on the Board of Trustees, what it
does or how much he gets paid.
   ``I guess it just helps run (Nelson) Township and decides what
happens,'' Boerman said, referring to the township in which Sand
Lake is contained. ``I really don't know but I will find out, the
hard way.''
   Election law requires tie votes to be resolved by a drawing.
   Vandenberg, 51, just resigned as the village president, a post
he held for six years. Thomas, 40, is a former village clerk.

<HEAD>Gore Meets Cuomo, Gephardt Meets Iacocca _ No Endorsements</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New grafs 2-4 with Bush backing Reagan veto of civil rights
bill</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats Albert Gore Jr. and Richard Gephardt campaigned in the
glow of popular non-candidates Monday _ Gore with Mario Cuomo and
Gephardt with Lee Iacocca _ but came away without endorsements.
Republican George Bush touted his endorsement by New Jersey Gov.
Thomas H. Kean.
   Bush, meanwhile, gave out another kind of endorsement _ lending
his support to President Reagan's veto of a major civil rights
bill. Congress was poised to override the veto on Tuesday.
   ``The legislation ... is imperfect and the imperfections should
be corrected,'' he told a group of black supporters in Washington.
``I'm not going to start doing now what I haven't been doing for
seven years, finding differences with the president, for whom I
have great respect.''
   Bush said, however, that he supported the idea that the federal
government should require that organizations that get tax dollars
comply with civil rights laws.
   Officials in Puerto Rico, meanwhile, continued to tally the
results of Sunday's primaries, in which Bush rolled up another
victory over Bob Dole and Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis added
to their Democratic totals.
   While Bush attended a New Jersey rally with Kean, Republican
rival Dole said in Wisconsin that that was the state where he was
trying to ``get back in the race.''
   Democratic candidates were focusing on Michigan, where
Saturday's caucuses are the next big event after weekend contests
in Kansas, Texas and Puerto Rico that helped Dukakis and Jackson.
   Gephardt and Gore won kind words but no endorsement in meetings
with Chrysler Corp. chairman Iacocca and New York Gov. Cuomo.
   Cuomo, the most prominent Democratic non-candidate, described
his meeting with Gore as ``excellent'' and ``interesting'' _ but
then said: ``Senator Gore said nothing that I haven't heard him say
before.''
   ``The endorsements don't mean a great deal. The truth is, I
didn't even need to see Al Gore,'' said Cuomo. ``It's nice of him
to come by.''
   Cuomo called the Democratic field a ``confused picture'' and
said he was ``now accelerating the process of trying to determine
how best to be useful to the Democratic Party.''
   Gephardt appeared with Iacocca, who also has been mentioned at
times as a possible presidential candidate, outside the Chrysler
Corp. headquarters in Highland Park, Mich., as Gephardt tried to
revive his flagging candidacy by stressing his tough trade policies
in the auto-producing state.
   Iacocca said, ``Dick Gephardt's a good friend of mine and he
knows what he's talking about on trade.'' But he made no
endorsement and said he also was looking forward to meeting with
other presidential candidates.
   Beyond Michigan, Wisconsin's primary 10 days later was shaping
up as a further Democratic battleground, two weeks before the big
New York primary April 19.
   Gore began running television ads in Wisconsin in hopes of
making it the state where he demonstrates appeal outside the South.
Sen. Paul Simon, who won in his home state last week, was making a
minimal effort in Michigan but intended to run ads in Wisconsin.
   Connecticut holds its primary one week earlier, March 29, and
Dukakis was considered the leader, although Gore would like to
demonstrate some strength in the Massachusetts governor's backyard.
   Jackson campaigned in Colorado, where caucuses are April 4, and
in Michigan on Monday.
   Republican Dole, also looking to Wisconsin, talked with farmers
in the northwest part of the state and renewed his call for Bush to
debate him.
   Earlier, in Green Bay, Dole accused the Reagan administration of
not doing a good job of making its case for aid to the Contras, who
are battling Nicaragua's Sandinista regime.
   ``If you took a poll in Wisconsin, I think a majority would be
opposed to Contra aid,'' he said. ``But if you asked the same
people if they think the Soviets should have a base in this
hemisphere, they would say `no' by a wide margin.''
   Kean's endorsement came as Bush added to a seemingly
insurmountable lead in delegates.
   Bush picked up the 14 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico's
primary Sunday, boosting his total to 788. That's nearly 70 percent
of the 1,139 he needs to win at the national convention in New
Orleans this summer. Dole had 178. Former television evangelist Pat
Robertson had 17.
   Bush won in Puerto Rico with an overwhelming 98 percent of the
vote in a primary system that in both parties was caught up in
local disputes and issues such as the divisive question of
statehood for the U.S. territory.
   The 51 Democratic delegates from Puerto Rico all ran as
uncommitted, and the candidates promised major efforts to woo them
in coming weeks.
   Jackson won the non-binding preference poll among Puerto Rico
Democrats. Dukakis ran second and Simon third.
   Dukakis won the Kansas caucuses on Saturday, picking up 16
delegates. But Jackson ran a strong second and won 14 delegates.
   In Texas, Jackson appeared to do better, splitting the delegates
there in county conventions that were the next step in allocating
at-large delegates for the state. That gave Jackson a one-delegate
edge over Dukakis in the Texas national delegate count _ including
both the primary and caucus results _ but more complete returns
could change that.
   In total delegates, Dukakis clung to a small lead over Jackson.
The figures were: Dukakis 526.5, Jackson 508.55, Gore 362.8, Simon
171.5 and Gephardt 154. To nominate, 2,082 delegates are needed.
   There are 138 delegates to be decided in Michigan's caucuses. A
weekend poll by the Detroit News had Dukakis with 33 percent and
Jackson 30 percent _ a virtual tie. Gephardt was far behind in
third place.

   Nicaragua withdrew its soldiers
from the Honduran border Monday and declared an end to fighting
while it holds truce talks with Contra rebels, according to reports
from all sides.
   Both Nicaragua and the Contras proposed cease-fires in talks
Monday.
   The border region remained tense, with Honduran patrols on the
lookout for any booby traps left behind by the Sandinistas.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said the 3,200 U.S. troops sent to
Honduras last week, after the Nicaraguan army was accused of
sending 2,000 men across the border in pursuit of Contras, may not
be needed any longer.
   ``The worst is over and there is peace now in the border
region,'' Col. Reynald Andino Flores, commander of the Honduran
army's 101st Infantry Brigade, said by telephone from his
headquarters in southern Honduras.
   ``We are remaining on a state of alert to be ready for anything
that may happen,'' he added, and soldiers are ``constantly
patrolling the area.''
   Flores and other officers, some of whom insisted on anonymity
for security reasons, said the Sandinistas penetrated an area of
about 20 square miles inside Olancho province while chasing the
U.S.-supported rebels in a two-week offensive to evict the Contras
from Nicaragua.
   About 200 border incidents have been reported in Olancho since
the Contras began fighting the leftist Sandinista government in
1981.
   President Daniel Ortega and the Nicaraguan government have
denied Sandinista soldiers crossed the border.
   The Contras maintain camps in an area called Bocay, which
includes territory on both sides of the border. Nicaragua claims
the camps, which the Contras use to store supplies and to stage
raids inside Nicaragua, are in Nicaraguan land but the rebels say
they are in Honduras.
   At Nicaragua's request, a U.N. fact-finding team will leave for
Nicaragua Tuesday to investigate the border violence, the United
Nations announced in a statement. It said observations will be
limited to the Nicaragua side, since no permission was received
from Honduras to go there.
   At Sapoa, a town on the Costa Rican border, representatives of
the Sandinista government and Contras held their first direct talks
Monday on Nicaraguan soil.
   At the conclusion of the first day of talks, both sides said
they presented cease-fire proposals and agreed to stop fighting
through the three-day negotiations.
   ``Neither side seeks a military victory over the other,'' said
Alfredo Cesar, head of the rebel delegation.
   Cesar told reporters the Contras proposed a 30-day cease-fire,
continuous talks to reach a truce, a total amnesty and guarantees
of free expression to lead toward reconciliation. He called the
talks, which were behind closed doors, ``a step ahead.''
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, leader of the government
delegation, said he proposed an ``immediate and definitive
cease-fire.'' He did not elaborate.
   Sending four battalions of the 82nd Airborne Division and 7th
Light Infantry to Honduras brought the U.S. military presence in
Honduras to more than 6,000 men. They are engaged in joint
exercises with the Hondurans, but away from the border combat area.
   U.S. and Honduran units have held joint exercises every few
months for the last five years.
   Some of the American troops practiced military maneuvers at an
airstrip only 20 miles from the Nicaraguan border on Sunday. A U.S.
Army transport helicopter crashed during an exercise farther from
the border, injuring all 10 U.S. soldiers aboard, Pentagon
spokesmen said in Washington.
   The UH-1 Huey helicopter crashed Monday afternoon near
Juticalpa, Honduras, said Maj. Gary Hovatter, spokesman for the
American forces sent to Honduras last week.
   Last Thursday and Saturday, Honduran jets bombed Sandinista
positions in the Bocay region, 145 miles east of Tegucigalpa. One
Honduran officer said the planes were sent because the Nicaraguans
``were not moving out fast enough.''
   He said the Honduran military had strengthened patrols along the
ill-defined 500-mile frontier with Nicaragua and Honduran jets were
conducting daily observation flights.
   Azcona said Sunday that, ``If there are no more incidents, the
Americans will leave.'' On Monday, he told The Associated Press:
``Honduras does not desire war but our armed forces are remaining
on a state of alert and conducting at least two air reconnaissance
flights daily.''
   When the soldiers were sent to Honduras last week, U.S.
officials said they would be here about 10 days.
   A Honduran military source said Monday there were ``very few
Nicaraguan soldiers in our territory. Our air reconnaissance
carried out this morning showed it.''
   In Washington, the focus turned to a renewed debate over U.S.
aid to the Contras. The Reagan administration indicated support for
a new $48 million proposal advanced by a bipartisan group of
senators.
   It would include funds to pay for delivery of up to $2.5 million
in previously authorized military aid.

<HEAD>Job Recipient Quits To Return To Chicago, Possible Marriage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTALES, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A down-and-out man who left his lean-to
shack in Chicago in January to begin a new life in New Mexico
headed back to Chicago on Monday for another new start and perhaps
marriage.
   Harold Thomas boarded the bus to Chicago after quitting the job
he had been given by a couple who read of his plight and offered
him a home in this farming and ranching community of about 11,000
people.
   ``It was just a place to stay and a meal,'' Thomas said of the
home he was given by Roy Gilman, 75, and his wife Ethel, 68. ``I
felt like a robot.''
   He said, however, that his big reason for leaving was, ``The
girl I was going with in Chicago wants to get married.''
   He said the Gilmans were nice people and had placed $300 in a
bank for him, but that they told him they could not afford to pay
him for his work.
   ``A man can't live with just room and board. After three months
with room and board, you know, I want to have a family and stuff.''
   Thomas said he was going to try to find a place to stay, and see
if his brother might help him.
   ``I think he's going to be happier with his people,'' Mrs.
Gilman said Monday night.
   ``He seemed very happy here,'' she said. ``It seemed like he
thought a lot of us. We thought a lot of him. It started out nice
and ended nice.''
   Thomas, 35, arrived in Portales on Jan. 17 after the Gilmans
read about him in an AP story published in the Portales
News-Tribune. They contacted the AP bureau in Chicago and said if
Thomas was willing to work, they'd provide him with a home and a
job.
   The Gilmans' son, Ralph, said Thomas didn't give any notice he
was quitting, just telling him Monday morning that he was homesick
and was ready to go.
   Before gaining national attention, Thomas wore ill-fitting
clothes and ate in soup kitchens. He and another man endured
subzero temperatures in a rotted wood and canvas shack on the banks
of the Chicago River because they said they felt safer there than
in city-run shelters.
   By the time Thomas boarded a bus for the 27-hour journey to New
Mexico, people had donated clothes, luggage and spending money.
   His new home was an 8-foot-by-30-foot trailer in the junkyard
where he worked eight hours a day, six days a week, tearing apart
old cars and rebuilding engines. The other day was spent working in
the fields at a church-run orphanage, where the Gilmans had
volunteered his service.

   Shipping executives said Iranian gunboats
attacked a Norwegian-operated tanker in the Persian Gulf early
Tuesday, three days after an Iraqi attack on a Norwegian ship left
54 seamen missing and presumed dead.
   Three rockets hit the the 380,534-ton Havglint, a liquified
pertroleum gas carrier that was carrying ammonia from Saudi Arabia,
a shipping source said on condition of anonymity. The ship flies
the Singapore flag but is operated by the Oslo-based company
Havtor, shipping executives said.
   At least one person was injured in the latest attack 12 miles
northwest of Dubai, said the executives, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The executives said the Havglint was leaking chemicals that
could pose be a pollution problem.
   It was the seventh shipping attack since Friday, when Iran, in
apparent reprisal for the resumption of Iraqi strikes against its
oil lifeline, ended a five-week hiatus in assaults on commercial
shipping in the gulf.
   On Monday, Iran attacked and set ablaze a Spanish freighter and
a Liberian tanker.
   There was no word on casualties aboard the 10,168-ton Spanish
refrigerator ship Iberian Reefer, which was ``burning fiercely'' at
dusk, hours after it was attacked in the Strait of Hormuz, maritime
salvage experts said.
   Salvage tugboats went to the scene. There was no word on
casualties.
   Earlier, shipping executives said at least one Iranian gunboat
fired rocket-propelled grenades at the 61,762-ton
Liberian-registered Fumi, setting its engine room ablaze and
blasting holes in one of its tanks.
   The Japanese-managed tanker, carrying Saudi Arabian oil, was on
its way out of the gulf. Shipping executives said salvage tugboats
helped the Fumi's crew extinguish the blaze.
   Spain called the attack on the Iberian Reefer ``an act of
aggression'' and summoned Teheran's ambassador to Spain to the
Foreign Ministry for an explanation.
   The maritime insurance firm, Lloyd's of London, said 37 ships
have been damaged in attacks by Iraq and Iran this year, more than
twice as many as in the first 2{ months of 1987, which was the
worst year for shipping since the gulf war began in 1980. The
figure did not include the attack on the Havglint.
   A Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman told The Associated Press
that 54 crewmen were presumed dead after Iraqi jets bombed two
Iranian tankers at the Kharg island oil terminal in the northern
gulf on Saturday.
   Most of the crew were Iranians or Asians, although a Swedish
officer was among the missing.
   If the Norwegian report is correct, it would be the highest
casualty toll in any attack by either side in the 4-year-old
``tanker war.''
   Christen Puntervold, spokesman for the Norwegian Shipping
Association in Oslo, said only four of 29 crewmen aboard the
253,837-ton Sanandaj were known to have survived, and all 29 aboard
the second tanker, the 316,379-ton Avaj, were missing.
   Both ships are owned by the Iran's National Iranian Tanker Co.
   A senior official of the Bahrain government suggested it was
time for a joint ``declaration'' that no interference with shipping
was tolerable.
   Information Minister Tariq Al-Moayyed told NBC News that foreign
forces should ``reach a declaration ... that they will not allow
interference with freedom of shipping in the gulf.''
   The Iraqi attacks are aimed at disrupting Iran's oil exports,
through which it finances the war, and forcing Tehran to accept a
peace proposal put forth by the United Nations.
   Iraq, meanwhile, fired a long-range missile into Tehran on
Monday in the 105th such attack in three weeks. Iran said 14
civilians, including two young girls, were killed in the explosion.
   The missile attack followed an unabated 24-hour artillery and
rocket barrage on Basra, Iraq's second-largest city and its only
outlet to the gulf.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
reported ``heavy casualties'' in Basra.
   Both sides have fired nearly 250 missiles into each other's main
cities and border towns since Feb. 29, reportedly killing hundreds
of civilians.
   Iran said that scores of Kurdish children, aged two to 10, were
being treated in Tehran hospitals for injuries they sustained when
Iraqi troops dropped outlawed chemical bombs in a border region
last week.
   Iran had said 5,000 Kurds were killed and 4,000 wounded when
Iraqi planes dropped chemical bombs on the town of Halabja and
adjacent villages after their capture in a land offensive.

   A tank loaded with sulfuric acid tumbled off the
back of a truck Monday, spilling six tons of the chemical onto a
street in the Volga River city of Ulyanovsk, the Tass news agency
said.
   The six tons of acid poured out onto the asphalt, but
specialists neutralized it with soda and none of the acid got into
Ulyanovsk's sewer system or ground water, Tass said.
   The agency said no injuries were reported in the accident in the
city of more than 480,000 people, about 500 miles east of Moscow.
   It said an investigation was under way.
   Tass blamed negligent workers at the Kontaktor plant for failing
to make certain the tank was securely fastened.
   Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, was born in the
city in 1870, when it was called Simbursk. Lenin's real name was
Ulyanov, and Soviet authorities renamed the city in his honor
following his death in 1924.

   Authorities are investigating whether a
former federal prosecutor manufactured threats against herself and
a magistrate during the extradition case of two Sikhs accused of
terrorism in India, the U.S. attorney said Monday.
   A search of former prosecutor Judy Russell's house revealed
similar threatening messages in a travel bag, said U.S. Attorney
Samuel A. Alito Jr.
   An FBI laboratory analysis concluded that typewritten characters
on envelopes containing the threats matched those on the
prosecutor's 1983 application to the U.S. attorney's office, Alito
said. The typewriter matching the print also was found in her
house, he said.
   Ms. Russell was in charge of handling the Sikhs' case as an
assistant U.S. attorney until leaving the office last summer to
enter private practice. She received a temporary appointment as a
special assistant after that, so she could continue to handle the
case.
   She had submitted sealed information to U.S. Magistrate Ronald
J. Hedges during the weeklong hearing about the extradition in
February. Alito revealed Monday that they consisted of three
typewritten envelopes containing the messages and one handwritten
envelope, all purportedly mailed to her Newark law office.
   One of the letters addressed to Ms. Russell said: ``Don't get
dead. Don't go to court.'' Hedges also received a threatening
letter, two weeks before the extradition hearing, Alito said.
   The revelations that Ms. Russell was under investigation came
during a court session requested by Alito to ``correct and
supplement'' the record regarding the threats.
   Robert J. Fettweis, Ms. Russell's attorney and former colleague
in the U.S. attorney's office, said she was in a private hospital.
He would not comment on any aspect of the case or the nature of her
illness.
   Alito said Ms. Russell had not been charged. The Justice
Department's Department of Public Integrity was handling the
investigation, he said.
   The extradition hearings took place Feb. 1-5 under extraordinary
security, including sharpshooters on rooftops, which federal
officials said was prompted by ``intelligence'' received by
investigators.
   Hedges ordered that the men, Ranjit Singh Gill, 25, and
Sukhminder Singh, 26, could be extradited. That ruling was being
appealed.
   Alito said the revelation about Ms. Russell's alleged
involvement in the threats had no affect on the outcome of the
extradition case, but said he would seek a new hearing ``only
because we want to avoid any appearance of impropriety.''
   The Indian government charges that Singh plotted the revenge
assassination of a retired general who led the bloody 1984 assault
against Sikh militants occupying the Sikhs' holiest shrine, the
Golden Temple in Amritsar.
   Gill was charged in the killing of a Parliament member.
   Singh's attorney, Ronald Kuby, called the affair ``clearly the
most astounding thing I've heard.'' He has accused the Indian
government of being behind the ``threats'' to poison the atmosphere
against the two Sikhs.

   Many owners of small businesses in Massachusetts

   Dukakis' first-in-the-nation health proposal, in final

insurance to every Massachusetts resident by 1992.
   The plan would require employers to offer coverage to their
workers within four years or begin paying an unemployment surcharge

   Scientists have redesigned a potent
natural poison so that it seeks out and kills cancer cells in the
test tube, signaling a possible new route for fighting some tumors,
a scientist said Monday.
   The poison, so strong that a dose the size of a salt grain can
kill a person, may be harnessed for fighting breast cancers that
have spread elsewhere in the body, and some lung and brain tumors,
said Ira Pastan of the National Cancer Institute.
   The strategy takes advantage of the fact that some cancer cells
display on their surface certain kinds of protein structures called
receptors. Specific substances bind to each kind of receptor before

   The latest squabble between prosecutors and
defense attornyes isn't about cases, tactics or money. It's about
being able to bypass new security procedures at the Dirksen Federal
Building, and it's headed for _ where else? _ the bench.
   Complaints from the public have been few, but the security
system brought the entire U.S. District Court system here to a
screeching halt one afternoon and prompted 39 attorneys _ including
several of Chicago's best-known defenders _ to petition the
district's 21 judges for the same exemptions granted to prosecutors
and building employees. A decision is expected Thursday.
   The U.S. Marshal's office said the procedures were in response
to a growing number of threats against the federal judiciary
nationwide and an increase in terrorism trials. They follow recent
trials of members of the El Rukn street gang and the Puerto Rican
independence group, FALN, on terrorism-related charges.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Race to Save History from Channel Tunnel Bulldozers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRETHUN, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen French archaeologists are racing
against a swarm of bulldozers in this coastal village, trying to
save precious history before it is churned to pieces by
construction of the tunnel under the English Channel.
   In reality, the race already is lost. According to the building
schedule, only six months remain for the historians to save what
they can from sites containing vestiges of paleolithic, neolithic,
Bronze Age, Iron Age, Gallo-Roman, Merovingian and Medieval
cultures.
   Sites that normally would take years to excavate are being dug
and studied in two months. The meticulous preparation through
library and archives research is being put off until later. The
focus is entirely on the ground, soon to be churned and destroyed.
   ``We know what we can't do,'' said Jean-Claude Routier, chief of
one crew working at a site on a chalk hill containing the remains
of an 11th century church and an earlier burial ground. ``We
select. We are starting to get used to the pressure.''
   A colleague, Jean-Pierre Jorrand, uncovering a nearby
Gallo-Roman site, said ``we stress recovering knowledge over
artifacts.''
   President Francois Mitterrand of France and Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher of Britain signed an accord in January 1986 for
the construction of a rail tunnel for trains to carry freight,
motor vehicles and passengers in both directions. It is scheduled
for completion by 1993 at an estimated cost of about $8 billion,
making it the largest privately financed building project ever
attempted.
   Though completion is still five years away, by September the
earthmovers will have torn into the entire 2,200-acre area that
will be the train terminal on the French side.
   The $442,000 budget for the archaeological excavations is
provided jointly by the French Culture Ministry, the Anglo-French
Eurotunnel building consortium, the state-run French railroad and
local and regional governments.
   ``It's difficult for an archaeologist to work so fast,'' says
Luc Vallin, conservator of antiquities and prehistory in the
Nord-Pas de Calais region of northern France as well as field
director here. ``It's really rescue archaeology.''
   The historians started working on an archaeological report in
the autumn of 1985, before the tunnel accord was signed. The report
was completed in March 1986, but archaeological work was delayed
while a financing agreement was worked out.
   Prospecting for potential digging sites began, with money
advanced by Eurotunnel, in September 1986, even before the budget
agreement was reached. Aerial surveys were made. Mechanical shovels
dug swaths across the ground in areas of potential archaeological
value.
   Twenty sites were selected.
   Some excavation began in June 1987, but work really didn't get
moving strongly until December.
   ``At one site, if we could have excavated it completely, we
could have reconstructed entire Gaullish houses,'' said Vallin.
``As it was, we had to content ourselves with what could be saved.''
   Archaeologists know very little about the Gallo-Roman era in
this region, roughly from Boulogne to the Belgian border. Rural
life in the medieval period also is a subject of great interest.
   ``Perhaps it's in the medieval period that we are finding the
most exciting material, and in protohistory,'' the Bronze and Iron
ages, Vallin said.
   The biggest problem, apart from time, is personnel.
   ``At some sites, we could have used 20 people for a year instead
of three for two months,'' Vallin said.
   Relations with the tunnel builders have been fairly good, even
if they sometimes push a little hard. The archaeologists and the
construction men meet once a week to discuss schedules.
   The vast range of history covered by the digs requires a wide
range of talent. Most of the archaeologists are contract workers
hired for a limited time, usually according to their speciality.
   ``From an educational point of view, I am a prehistorian,''
Vallin said. ``But I have learned a lot about the Roman and
medieval periods.''
   Sitting on the chalk hill surveying the remains of a medieval
church and nearby structures, crew chief Routier was preparing to
move on after 2{ months at the site.
   ``It would be interesting to dig up all the graves to study the
methods of the period,'' he said. ``It's all going to disappear
with the bulldozers.''
   Even so, Vallin and the others said, without the tunnel project,
it's likely the sites would not have been tapped at all because of
lack of funding.

<HEAD>In Nepal, a Mountain of Paperwork Comes Before the Mountain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is the very picture of adventure, the
climber planting a flag in triumph atop an icy Himalayan peak. What
isn't generally known, however, is that a mountain of paperwork has
to be scaled first.
   Mountain climbing in Nepal, for all its risk and romance, also
means conquering an array of permits, payments, insurance forms,
and wills for Sherpa guides. And then comes patience, for it can
take years to get it all done.
   Anyone who wants to climb the famed Mount Everest, for example,
may have to wait six or seven years to get a Nepalese government
permit because the world's highest peak also is Nepal's most
desired challenge. Then there are the expenses and 58 pages of
rules set down by Nepal's government.
   ``Probably 80 percent of the effort is getting to the bottom of
the mountain (to start the climb),'' says Steve Langley, a Canadian
leading a six-week expedition up 22,479-foot Mount Ama Dablam, 10
miles southwest of Everest.
   Langley, a 40-year-old computer consultant from Calgary,
Alberta, first applied to climb the mountain in 1982.
   ``We arrived here without the permit,'' he said. ``It was
finally granted officially three weeks ago.''
   Murari P. Khatiwada of Nepal's Mountaineering Division says the
long wait is due to the growing number of people who want to ascend
122 of the 1,310 peaks Nepal grants permits for.
   ``Ten years ago we had 20 expeditions throughout the year. Now
we have more than 100,'' said Khatiwada.
   He explained that amounted to 800 to 1,000 climbers, not
including the guides and porters, usually from the nimble Sherpa
tribe, who accompany foreign mountaineers.
   For this reason, Khatiwada said, nearly all Nepal's mountains
are booked through 1990 and applications for some peaks are being
accepted for the year 2000.
   He said it was vital to limit the number of climbers to protect
Nepal's environment.
   ``A mountain is fragile,'' he explained. ``It cannot bear the
burden of too many people.''
   Just as frustrating as the wait for climbers are the government
regulations, which get down to such details as how many socks,
shoes and umbrellas must be supplied to guides and porters. They
also list fees for the peaks. All that is just the beginning of an
expedition's expenses.
   The permit to climb Everest's 29,028 feet costs $2,547. For any
other peak above 26,400 feet, the fee is $2,038. For Mount Ama
Dablam, it costs $1,528.
   Langley's team of himself, four other Canadians and an American
has budgeted $24,000 for the climb, and he said ``we're doing it on
the cheap.''
   All his people are experienced and already have most of the
needed equipment. The American climber, Tom Dickey, 31, of Boulder,
Colo., has worked as a trekking guide in Nepal.
   But the team is taking along a liaison officer, required by the
government but paid by the expedition; a chief Sherpa; an
assistant, and 12 porters. Salaries for all are specified in the
government rules, along with the equipment to be provided them.
   Langley said the actual gear is rarely given the Sherpas, most
of whom have equipment from earlier climbs, and a cash payment is
usually negotiated in lieu of equipment.
   ``The daily salary, in the scheme of things, is peanuts,'' said
Langley.
   He said the pay to the government liaison officer, for example,
is $2 a day. His equipment allowance comes to the equivalent of
$800.
   Other expenses include $1,000 for an agency to help ease the way
through the Nepalese bureaucracy, $350 for required insurance for
climbers and Sherpas, and the cost of getting climbers and their
equipment to Nepal.
   Each man on Langley's team is putting up $4,000 to make the
climb, although expeditions often seek funds from mountaineering
societies, philanthropists or companies wanting publicity for their
products.
   Peter Hill, an Englishman also leading an expedition up Ama
Dablam, said he wrote 400 letters seeking backing without success.
   ``To get money these days for a peak, it's got to be unclimbed
or it's got to be Everest,'' he complained.
   But Hill, 26, ran into a stroke of luck. His father happened
upon a newspaper ad for a bank, Perpetual Unit Trust, picturing its
symbol _ the peak of Ama Dablam.
   Dickey, the Colorado climber, noted that mountaineers can avoid
all the preliminary trouble by climbing Europe's Alps or the Andes
in South America, where no permits are needed.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``I'm in on an Everest expedition in
1990.''

<HEAD>U.S.-Run Plantation Flourishes Despite Rebel Threats</HEAD>

   Although Communist rebels
threaten to attack U.S. businesses in the Philippines, one American
company is growing pineapples on a substantial chunk of Mindanao
island and showing little fear in doing it.
   ``It's a very open company and a very open society,'' said Brian
Carew, field operations manager of the Philippine Packing Corp.,
local subsidiary of RJR Reynolds, which now owns the Del Monte
brand of products. ``I feel safer here than in New York.''
   Communist rebels, who operate near this giant plantation some
500 miles southeast of Manila, have threatened to attack American
interests in retaliation for U.S. support of Philippines
governments that have been fighting the insurgents for 19 years.
   This past November the rival Dole-Philippines Inc., considered
abandoning its fruit plantation in Mindanao's South Cotabato
province after raids by Communist rebels resulted in more than
$250,000 worth of property and equipment damage.
   The Del Monte plantation, in Bukidnon province, has no fencing
and only a small security force.
   In December, Communist New People's Army guerrillas raided a
military camp in the Bukidnon town of Don Carlos and made off with
a machine gun, more than 20 automatic assault rifles, grenades and
thousands of rounds of ammunition.
   Carew, a native of Dorchester, Mass., said Communist bands
occasionally pass through the western side of the plantation but
have not attacked. He said Del Monte does not pay the rebels
protection money.
   Since Del Monte began operations in the Philippines in 1926, its
holdings have grown from about 9,880 acres to more than 61,750
acres around the towns of Impasugong, Sumilao, Libona and Manolo
Fortich.
   One-third of the land is leased from the government's National
Development Corp. for about $16 an acre a year. The rest is leased
from local farmers.
   Company officials said in interviews with The Associated Press
that Del Monte employs about 10,600 workers, including about 100 at
company headquarters in Manila. Most workers come from Bukidnon and
neighboring Misamis Oriental province.
   The subsidiary had gross sales of $110 million last year and net
income of $20.7 million. It earned $78.8 million in hard currency
for the Philippines and paid the Philippines peso equivalent of $21
million in taxes.
   Company officials estimate that about 60,000 people in the area
depend on the plantation.
   At Camp Philipps, the largest of the subsidiary's seven camps,
workers's quarters are simple but adequate. A large social hall
dominates the main road, next to a cooperative store where workers
buy most of their daily needs.
   ``Speak English'' signs are posted on the walls of the camp's
vocational school for boys.
   Children of management officials, including Carew's 12-year-old
daughter, Jessica, attend the Del Monte School up to seventh grade.
The school teaches 20 to 25 children, about three-fourths of them
Filipino.
   Private secondary schools and colleges are subsidized by the
comany and tuition fees are comparatively low.
   Officials said the average daily salary is 105 pesos ($5.25),
nearly double the mandated minimum wage. Medical treatment is free.
Housing, including electricity and water, is free for some 2,000
senior employees while others get housing allowances.
   Brian Haycox, the Philippines company president, said Del Monte
believes in above average worker benefits because ``we can't run
our business, manage it and address all the issues facing us today
unless we have good human resource development.''
   The company does not allow visiting journalists to interview
workers unless accompanied by an official.
   ``I don't apologize to anybody about what we do because we do it
well,'' Carew told a group of visiting reporters.
   The company came in for criticism this past October in report by
a Swiss mission that visited in February 1987. The mission, made up
of the Migros Cooperative Society, Swiss Aid, Helbetas, Swiss
Lenten Fund and Bread for Brethren, said many workers complained of
harassment and intimidation by lower- and middle-grade supervisors
and of unjustified promotions.
   ``The overriding feeling is one of fear of losing the job,'' the
report said. ``Mistrust of the company is widespread.''
   It added that workers showed ``little confidence'' in their
unions, the Associated Labor Union and the Workers Alliance of
Trade Unions, which it said are perceived as pro-management.
   But worker activity against the company has been limited.
   Some workers have been picketing the company's cannery in nearby
Gugo, and a company bus was set afire early this year.
   The Swiss mission report also criticized the company's policy of
leasing land from local farmers, charging the leases are couched in
language the farmers can't understand.
   Adrian Pabayo, the company's public relations manager, defended
the policy.
   ``There is enough land available here not being used,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gandhi's Opposition More Vociferous but Still in Disarray</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years after he was swept to office
in a landslide, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has become the target
of a vociferous opposition campaign for his ouster.
   Anti-government rallies have been drawing thousands of
slogan-shouting demonstrators to New Delhi. Parliament has been
disrupted by angry walk-outs. General strikes have closed
businesses and schools.
   ``We think he is vulnerable,'' said Prakash Karat of the Marxist
Communist Party of India, which has helped organize some of the
agitation. ``If he dares to call a mid-term poll (snap election),
the opposition has a good chance of winning.''
   In Karat's eyes, the 43-year-old prime minister has brought the
problems on himself. He cited charges of corruption, rising Sikh
separatist violence in Punjab state and mounting economic problems.
   Gandhi has so far rejected calls for a snap election, and aides
and some independent analysts say the opposition parties are too
much in disarray to beat him anyway.
   The handful of factions are united only in their anti-Gandhi
fervor and often tend to compete more with each other. No overall
leader has emerged from among the dissidents.
   The Indian press, alive to rumors that Gandhi may indeed call an
election, has begun talking about his ``TINA factor,'' an acronym
for ``there is no alternative.'' Supporters and detractors alike
say TINA may ensure that Gandhi not only weathers the political
storm but emerges with a second, five-year term.
   A poll of more than 10,000 voters conducted in February for
India Today, a biweekly news magazine, indicated that if Parliament
elections were held now, Gandhi's Congress Party would win 64
percent of the seats.
   That would be down from the 77 percent Congress won in December
1984, when Gandhi came to power on a wave of sympathy two months
after his mother and predecessor, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated
by two Sikh bodyguards. But it's more than enough to form a
government in India's multiparty system.
   ``Rajiv Gandhi's Congress benefits from the TINA factor
precisely because the opposition parties show no signs of coming
together,'' India Today concluded.
   Ashis Nandy, a political analyst at the Center for the Study of
Developing Societies, doesn't agree. Regardless of what opinion
polls show, he said, the opposition could defeat Gandhi.
   ``The Indian electorate traditionally either rewards a regime
for ruling well or punishes it for ruling badly,'' Nandy added.
``Although Rajiv Gandhi may still be personally honest, he looks
tainted, looks inefficient. The voters do not feel good about him.''
   Just who would lead an opposition charge nationally remains in
question. The strongest contender is V.P. Singh, who was Gandhi's
finance minister and then defense minister before being ousted from
the Congress Party on grounds of anti-party activity.
   Singh now assails Gandhi as ``a total failure.'' He and a dozen
other Congress dissidents have been trying to forge alliances with
other opposition groups. No common front has emerged, in part
because leftist groups like the Communist Party refuse to ally
themselves with right-wing, Hindu-dominated parties like the
Bharatiya Janata Party.
   Gandhi enjoyed a honeymoon, of sorts, during his first two years
in office. An airline pilot before moving into politics, he
promised to modernize India and was nicknamed ``Mr. Clean'' for his
pledge to bring honest government to the 800 million Indians.
   With the Congress-dominated Parliament behind him, Gandhi
liberalized industrial policy, modified the tax system to encourage
private investment and increased funding for education and health.
   Last year, the honeymoon ended. First came the disclosure that
Gandhi's Finance Ministry had hired an American detective agency to
investigate the illegal overseas bank accounts of Indians, a
controversial move in a nation wary of foreign influence.
   Next came the announcement that the government was investigating
alleged kickbacks paid on contracts for Swedish artillery and West
German submarines.
   Opposition leaders and several powerful newspapers seized the
corruption issue and hammered away with allegations that some of
the bribes went to Gandhi or his allies in the Congress Party.
   None of the charges were proved, but Gandhi was forced to go to
Parliament and deny personal involvement.
   At the same time, domestic problems mounted.
   _The annual monsoon rains failed, plunging two-thirds of the
nation into drought.
   _Attacks by Sikh extremists in Punjab rose dramatically, leaving
more than 1,000 people dead by the end of 1987.
   _An Indian-sponsored peace accord in nearby Sri Lanka was signed
but shortly collapsed. Although Gandhi has sent more than 50,000
troops to the island to put down a Tamil separatist rebellion, the
opposition has not focused on the issue.
   ``Last year there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty,'' said
a Gandhi aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We weathered
it. Since then, a lot of high temperatures have come down.''

   Police have restored order in Tibetan streets
following the second bloody pro-independence protest in five
months, but China's policy toward the rugged area remains in
disorder with signs of backstage wrangling.
   On the one side are officials who argue for leniency, noting
that the Chinese earned the hatred of Tibetans during the 1960s and
1970s by virtually outlawing Buddhism, the center of most Tibetans'
lives.
   The Panchen Lama, the highest-ranking Tibetan religious leader
in China, is among these. An official news report after a protest
March 5 quoted him as saying China must ``further improve regional
autonomy ... and heal the wounds caused by the ultra-leftist line.''
   He promised ``even more lenient and flexible policies'' from
Beijing, whose rule he supports.
   On the other side are those who believe Beijing's relative
leniency since 1980 is to blame for the unrest and that only a
tough crackdown will ensure it is not repeated.
   ``It is necessary to exercise dictatorship over such
separatists,'' the director of United Front's Tibet department,
Zheng Ying, was quoted as saying. The United Front is an
organization that seeks to coordinate relations between the
governing Communist Party and other parties, which are few.
   Other reports have quoted unidentified officials as declaring
that the government ``has exercised too much restraint.''
   So far, neither side appears to have won out. Sketchy reports
from foreign travelers to Tibet's capital, Lhasa, indicate
widespread arrests but the monasteries do not appear to be under
direct police control, as they were after demonstratons last year.
   No foreign journalists have been allowed in Lhasa since March 5.
   Piecing together official accounts and those of foreign
witnesses, this picture emerges of what happened that day:
   Hundreds of monks had gathered outside the 1,300-year-old
Jokhang Temple in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, for the conclusion of a
10-day prayer festival. One monk stood up suddenly and called for
Tibetan independence.
   As police dragged him away, other monks took up the chant and
stoned the officers. More than 12 hours of violence followed,
during which thousands of Tibetans stoned police from behind
makeshift barricades and burned Chinese restaurants. Police set off
tear gas and stormed the Jokhang.
   According to official accounts, one policeman was killed and
more than 30 hospitalized. Western travelers in Lhasa said Tibetans
reported 21 Tibetans and three policemen killed.
   In its duration and scope, the protest appeared much larger than
the attack by thousands of Tibetans Oct. 1 on a police station in
Lhasa. Foreign witnesses reported at least 14 people killed then.
   The new violence makes it clear the violence Oct. 1 was not an
isolated incident, the result of momentarily high emotions, but
rather an expression of Tibetan determination to shake off 37 years
of Chinese Communist rule.
   It thus makes more difficult Beijing's task of charting a policy
most likely to keep the peace.
   Those who favor conciliation and greater autonomy and
development aid for Tibetans hope to gain time for a gradual
cultural assimilation under the gentle pressure of Chinese schools,
television and other influences.
   But those opposed to liberal policies argue that relaxation has
fostered rebellion by allowing Tibet's Buddhist monasteries to
reopen and enroll new candidates.
   The monasteries have become hotbeds of religious-inspired
nationalism, with most monks praying for the return of the Dalai
Lama, Tibet's former temporal and spiritual leader now in exile in
India.
   The Dalai Lama, regarded as a reincarnation of Tibet's protector
god, fled in 1959 during a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
The Dalai Lama is central to Tibetan Buddhism, which in turn is
central to Tibetans' cultural identity.
   The clashes Oct. 1 and March 5 began when monks shouted
independence slogans, and the youngest monks generally led the
violence.
   A harsh crackdown on the monasteries might crush this source of
nationalism _ or encourage more martyrdom.
   It also could trigger concern in China's other minority areas
about the depth of Beijing's commitment to their own local
autonomy. Most of China's strategic border regions are populated by
minorities.
   Notable in the aftermath of the protest was the lack of any
significant U.S. response. After the Oct. 1 clash, the U.S. Senate
adopted a resolution urging greater respect for human rights in
Tibet. The resolution prompted angry protests from China of what it
called interference in its internal affairs.
   This time, Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian of China was in the
United States but U.S. officials did not mention Tibet in public.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz raised the issue in
private talks with Wu but it was not allowed to disturb the visit's
overall atmosphere of friendliness. Instead, the Reagan
administration lifted a freeze on expanding sales of
high-technology goods to China. The freeze was imposed last year to
protest Chinese missile sales to Iran.

   China's liberal policies in Tibet created the conditions that
sparked bloody riots in Lhasa in October and early March, according
to American Tibet scholars and U.S. officials.
   In an ironic twist, the observers say, Beijing's attempts to
improve the lot of the Tibetan people have caused a crisis of
higher expectations, prompting Tibetans to seek faster change from
a recalcitrant Beijing.
   These observers predict that rioting in the province's capital,
Lhasa, on March 5 will prompt an iron-fisted crackdown and the
return of hardline Chinese rule to the ``roof of the world.''
   Such a crackdown will postpone again any possibility of
resolving China's main minority problem, ensuring renewed suffering
for Tibetans.
   ``Tibetans are grabbing for a mile when the Chinese are offering
them an inch,'' said a State Department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``We see little possibility for
resolution.''
   ``After (the disturbances March 5) a military response is the
only way,'' said Tom Grunfeld, a Tibetan expert and professor at
the State University of New York's Empire State College in
Manhattan. ``It's part of the sad equation in Tibet.''
   China has claimed sovereignty over the Himalayan region since
the 13th century. But many Tibetans view the Chinese as an
occupying force and yearn for independence.
   In 1950 the Chinese Red Army entered Tibet and Beijing promised
Tibetan leaders a measure of autonomy. It failed to deliver.
   Nine years later, Tibetans rebelled. The Chinese army cracked
down and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's temporal and spiritual leader,
fled to India.
   In 1966, conditions further deteriorated with the onset of
China's ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution.
   Atheist Chinese Red Guards, charging that Tibet was backward and
feudalistic, attempted to destroy its Buddhist culture. Of Tibet's
3,000 temples only a handful survived. Thousands of monks and
religious pilgrims were slaughtered.
   Grunfeld said his interviews with refugees gave no indications
of sustained unrest among the Tibetan people from 1959 to 1976.
   ``The Chinese clamped a very tight lid on Tibet. Any protest was
crushed immediately.''
   Conditions in Tibet began to improve after the end of the
Cultural Revolution with the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung in 1976.
   Hu Yaobang, the former Communist Party boss, went to Lhasa and
issued a public apology for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution.
   For the first time since 1959, Tibetans were allowed to travel
from one county to the next without government permission.
   Hospitals were built, the Tibetan language was allowed back in
the schools and taxes were cut or eliminated. China opened its
border with Nepal, allowing renewed contact with the Tibetan exile
community.
   With an eye to a profitable tourist trade, the Chinese also
began repairing some of the monasteries destroyed by the Red
Guards. A prohibition on Buddhist proselytzing was lifted and young
monks appeared again in the temples.
   In 1980, representatives of the Dalai Lama began negotiations
with the Chinese to set conditions for his return to China.
Negotiations broke off two years later because the Chinese insisted
that he live in Beijing and he wanted to live in Lhasa.
   ``The Chinese are pumping millions of dollars into the region
and there are only 3 million people there,'' Grunfeld said.
``Things are looking up, especially in the cities.''
   Emboldened by reforms, Tibetans staged pro-independence
demonstrations in September and October last year and again March 5
and 6.
   The demonstrations were led by monks, Tibet's traditional
soldiers, who Grunfeld said, don't fit the Western idea of ``a
contemplative individual making cheese and wine.''
   The observers said China's reforms prompted the riots because
they allowed Tibetans to congregate more freely without fear of
instant repression. The reforms also allowed contact with Tibetans
abroad. And by opening Tibet to Western tourists, the Chinese
provided the monks with an international stage for their protests.
   The success of the reforms also played a hand.
   ``The reforms have created among some Tibetan refugees a sense
of desperation,'' said the State Department official. ``It's like
they said, `We've got to act now or we'll never be able to do it
again.'''
   Many Tibetans claim the reforms are insidious, aimed at turning
Tibet into a living museum to boost China's tourism industry.
   They also claim their land is being overrun by hordes of
Chinese, sent in from Beijing to Sinicize the remote region.
   Grunfeld says the truth of that allegation depends on how one
defines Tibet.
   Tibet's current boundaries correspond to its traditional
political influence. But Tibetan activists define Tibet as the area
of its traditional cultural influence which includes large tracts
of Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.
   Grunfeld said thousands of Chinese settlers are moving to those
three provinces but few are going to Tibet.
   But he added that the region cannot lure enough competent
Chinese officials to manage it.
   ``It's a dumping ground for incompetents. The Chinese can't get
anyone to go there.''

   Blacks' most obvious gains in the two decades
since Martin Luther King's assassination have come in politics.
From an era in which people had to march, and sometimes die, to win
blacks the right to vote, the United States today is listening
seriously to a black presidential candidate and counts thousands of
black elected officials, including the mayors of 17 of its largest
cities. But as the second story of three assessing black progress
in America reports, it is one of its smallest towns, Bolton, Miss.,
that is considered a model of political advancement.

<TEXT>
   Its decaying store fronts, tar-paper roofs
and rusty railroad tracks suggest Bolton is just another town time
forgot.
   But each day, a sign of how much times have changed appears when
a tall, slender black man drives up to city hall. The street is
named after Martin Luther King Jr., and the man is the mayor.
   Lawrence Butler, a man once barred from the ballot box, now
presides over this ragged rural hamlet some call a model of black
political progress in America.
   No blacks were allowed to vote in Bolton municipal elections
until 1969. Today, its mayor and four of five council members are
black. Change, indeed, but Butler says blacks still haven't reached
the mountaintop.
   ``I know we ain't where we used to be,'' he said. ``Lord, we
ain't where we ought to be. Sometimes, I question myself, where are
we?''
   In the 15 years since it elected its first black mayor, Bolton,
population 650, has built a new city hall and community center,
paved streets, built houses, bought land for an industrial park and
acquired an ambulance and fire and garbage trucks.
   ``What Bolton represents since it got black leadership is
certainly progress, for blacks, even for whites,'' said Linda
Williams, senior political analyst at the Joint Center for
Political Studies in Washington.
   Bolton is a prime example of ``how blacks deprived in a
segregated system ... can take political power, turn a town around
and make it more responsive to the needs of black citizens,'' said
attorney Frank Parker.
   Parker spearheaded many legal fights on behalf of elected blacks
seeking to take office in Bolton. Courts and judges intervened,
federal pollwatchers came to town and death threats were made
before it all came about.
   Hundreds of other communities in all corners of the United
States have made white-to-black political transitions in the 20
years since King's assassination. Some of the biggest change has
come in the South, home to more than half of the U.S. black
population.
   Blacks are running towns they marched through in the '60s,
fighting for the right to vote. The number of Southern black
elected officials has increased by 55 times since 1965, Williams
said.

cadre of state troopers, turned him away, has 548 black elected
officials _ tops in the nation.
   Mississippi has changed in many ways. Bolton is part of the
metamorphosis.
   ``The No. 1 progress is getting rid of the fear,'' said Butler,
who picked cotton as a child and once picketed a whites-only pool
with a sign that urged, ``Don't blow your cool. Let us in the
pool.''
   ``Used to be you had a fear of somebody coming up to you and ...
accusing you of anything,'' he said. ``You might have a
confrontation with a white and there was no such thing as winning.''
   Butler never doubted blacks could manage Bolton. He just didn't
think it would happen.
   ``I figured whites would have died before they let us have the
right to vote,'' he said. ``Some did. And blacks did, too.''
   Black officeholders here, he said, have given folks ``a certain
sense of pride and understanding. Blacks know there's somebody here
on a day-to-day basis fighting for them.''
   Still, black leadership has not made poor people richer, or two
societies one.
   Butler estimates blacks' annual income in Bolton at about $4,500
_ about a third that of whites. He said about 25 percent of blacks
are jobless.
   Although blacks and whites live together, they attend separate
churches and social functions, and white children attend private
schools.
   ``I would love to paint you a peaches-and-cream story,'' said
Bennie Thompson, the town's first black mayor, now a member of the
Hinds County Board of Supervisors.

<HEAD>BOLTON: of Supervisors.</HEAD>

   ``I want to tell you I stand by my fence and drink coffee (with
my white) neighbor. I can't tell you that. It's not reality.''
   ``Everybody gets along,'' said Doug Beard, the sole white
council member. ``(But) I think both feel better with their own
peers.''
   In Bolton, politics brings neither power nor prestige. The mayor
and council are part-time posts. There are no big salaries, no
high-profile jobs.
   And there's little to lure outsiders, particularly with Jackson
16 miles away. A cotton gin is virtually the only industry, and the
main drag is a row of crumbling, century-old stores.
   Still, Bolton was important enough to cause a lot of kicking and
screaming when blacks, about 60 percent of the population, wanted a
say in government.
   ``It was a long, tough fight _ harder and tougher than any I've
ever seen in Mississippi,'' said Parker, now at the Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in Washington, D.C.
   ``The whites perceived their town as their plantation. It was
theirs to run.''
   The fight began in the late '60s. Thompson, a local college
graduate who marched in Mississippi with King, felt blacks had been
ignored long enough.
   ``It wasn't an attempt to take over,'' he said. ``All we wanted
to do is help develop the community.'' Blacks, including Thompson,
sought three of five aldermanic seats.
   After fights over registration procedures, and complaints filed
with federal authorities, the blacks won. The losers sued, alleging
voter irregularities. The blacks prevailed in appeals court.
   But after the mayor repeatedly vetoed the black aldermen's
proposals, Thompson ran for mayor in 1973 on an all-black slate.
That winning slate also was sued _ unsuccessfully.
   ``This town has generated more voting litigation than any I know
of in Mississippi to keep blacks from taking office,'' Parker said.
   That was just the beginning. When Thompson took office, the
police department quit, the county repossessed the garbage truck
and the lease on the garbage dump was revoked. Thompson said he
found that town records were kept on a school notepad, water bill
monies were stored in a lard can and town employees were paid from
the general store, which was then reimbursed.
   ``Being black, we couldn't afford to operate the system like our
counterparts,'' he explained, because it would make them vulnerable
to corruption charges. ``The system would have destroyed us. What
kinds of checks and balances do you have putting money in a lard
can?''
   To make matters worse, Bolton lacked the basics. Fires, for
example, were fought with a pickup truck with a loose wheel and a
pump on the back.
   So Thompson launched a letter-writing campaign, asking
foundations and cities for help. It came: A fire truck, donated for
one dollar, from New York City; a garbage truck from Southfield,
Mich.; an ambulance from Marshalltown, Iowa, and a planner from the
National Council of Churches who developed a town hall, fire
station, park and day-care center.
   Gravel streets in the black neighborhoods were paved, sewer and
water improvements were made. A $1.1 million, 40-unit, subsidized
housing development was built for low-income and elderly residents
in the middle of the white part of town, drawing angry opposition.
   ``We have shown that black elected officials can bring a
community from virtual obscurity into the 20th century _ from the
standpoint of municipal services, human and social needs,'' said
Thompson, who says he has received death threats over the years.
``But we also created hope that things can be better. There was no
hope. There was nothing.''
   Some disagree. While Beard concedes some improvements have been
made, ``the overall appearance of the city is much worse,'' he
said. ``Business is worse because people don't like coming to an
area (that looks) deplorable.''
   Thompson stepped down in 1979 to become a board member in the
county _ one of the first two blacks. Butler, who moved to Bolton
as a teen-ager, has been mayor since, running unopposed in 1985.
   Parker says whites ``have basically deserted the political
process.''
   Beard says they don't seek office for ``the same reason blacks
are not runnning in Bolton. People just don't care, to be honest.''
   Thompson says they do, and black leadership has changed Bolton.
   ``There are young people in our community who've never seen
anybody in authority except somebody who's black. They're good role
models,'' he said. ``Black elected officials clearly represent a
new awakening. ...
   ``We can't run this community like our white predecessors. We
want things to be accessible to everybody.''

   They are a new breed of leaders, protesters turned politicians,
outsiders turned insiders, the powerless become powerful.
   Blacks are reshaping politics across America, calling the shots
today in towns where they risked beatings, cattle prods, jail and
even death a generation ago as they fought for the right to vote.
   Nationwide, almost 6,700 blacks held elected office last year,
more than four times that of 1970, according to the Joint Center
for Political Studies, a black-oriented think tank in Washiks now lead
four of the nation's six largest cities _ Tom
Bradley in Los Angeles, Eugene Sawyer in Chicago, Wilson Goode in
Philadelphia and Coleman Young in ngton.
   BlacDetroit. Thirteen other big
cities have black mayors, including Marion Barry of Washington,
D.C., and Andrew Young of Atlanta.
   Blacks have more than doubled their ranks in Congress in 20
years. And Jesse Jackson, a one-time lieutenant of Martin Luther
King Jr., is making surprising inroads among white voters in his
second White House bid.
   ``Twenty years ago, it would have been unthinkable,'' said U.S.
Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a veteran civil rights activist.ch some
manufacturers of distilled spirits avoid a significant share of the
$12.50-a-gallon liquor tax by mixing some products with a
grape-based alcohol. This is expected to raise $360 million over
five years.
   The committee's bill does nothing about a 1986 law, also aimed
at tax evaders, that requires about 82,000 state, city and county
government units to pay taxes of 9.1 cents a gallon on their
gasoline and apply later for a refund. That provision took effect
Jan. 1.

   ``Black power was to me a black version of ethnic American
politics,'' said Charles Hamilton, a Columbia University political
science professor and co-author with Carmichael of ``Black Power _
The Politics of Liberation in America.''
   ``We're talking about no more than what Italians have done, what
the Irish have done,'' he said. ``Before we almost had to
assimilate in order to achieve. I saw that as wrong. It denied
one's heritage.''
   Black power gave birth to a new sense of self-worth.
   ``What the black power movement was all about was you've got to
shed the negative image,'' Morris said. ``That's why you got (the
phrase) `black is beautiful.' There was a profound evaluation of
black people, of who they are.''
   ``It was a repudiation of the notion blacks had to judge their
own beauty and importance by white standards,'' he added.
   New styles and customs emerged, emphasizing black roots:
Afro-American names, mushrooming Afro hairdos and loose-fitting,
boldly patterned dashikis.
   One symbol _ the clenched fist _ stirred anger, and sometimes
fear. At the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, just six months after
King's assassination, sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the
gold and bronze medal winners in the 200-meter dash, raised
black-gloved fists high overhead as the national anthem was played.
For what they termed a display of black unity and protest of black
poverty, the two athletes were suspended by the U.S. Olympic
Committee.
   The symbols and words of black power shocked many whites, even
some who marched in civil rights demonstrations.
   Some ``found it extremely threatening,'' said Douglas McAdam,
associate sociology professor at the University of Arizona. To
them, ``it smacked of reverse racism _ no longer equality, but
black power, black domination.''
   McAdam has written a book chronicling how financial
contributions dropped when groups such as the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee, a civil rights organization, shifted focus
from the fight for equality to more incendiary urgings.
   The movement also divided blacks. King, who preached non-violent
tactics, said the slogan carried the wrong connotations and was
potentially destructive.
   Separatism wasn't the answer, he argued, because blacks and
whites needed each other. ``There is no salvation for the Negro
through isolation,'' King wrote in his book, ``Where Do We Go From
Here: Chaos or Community?''
   ``He thought it was too divisive, too difficult to explain,''
Hamilton said. ``He was right.''
   Other black leaders and groups, including the NAACP, also
opposed the black power term, creating friction as two movements
competed for center stage.
   ``The civil rights movement was overrun,'' Walters said. ``Many
of its leaders would not join black power. ... More fundamentally,
it took away the allegiance of the people.''
   But academics also note that black leaders eventually supported
many of the movement's goals. King, in particular, embraced the
psychological need for black power and the importance of black
economic strength.
   After his assassination, the movement took new forms as some of
its causes became mainstream.
   ``Once blacks got the vote and began to elect more (blacks),
people began to believe they at least had channels,'' said Linda
Williams, senior political analyst at the Joint Center for
Political Studies.
   The black power movement also weakened as radicals were jailed
and the government cracked down; the FBI conducted a secret
campaign of ``dirty tricks'' involving faked Panther documents and
letters, informants and infiltrators.
   ``It was surprising to me the movement was destroyed so
completely,'' said Newton, Panther co-founder. Newton today
believes any gains made by the black power movement have been wiped
out.
   ``Black unemployment is very high,'' he said. ``Police actions
are as belligerent as ever. Overt racism is on the rampage as if
there never was a movement.''
   With the hindsight of 20 years, some criticize black power as
merely words without a program. Others say it left a strong legacy.
   Academics point to the growth of black-owned businesses,
newspapers and radio stations, as well as greater numbers of black
journalists and literature and arts programs.
   Others cite the thousands of black officeholders and Jesse
Jackson's strong presidential bid. ``Black power today is being
carried out in the electoral arena,'' Jennings sai.
   Universities offer hundreds of black studies programs, and
Hamilton credits the movement for the formation of such groups as
the Congressional Black Caucus.
   Still, the movement has not given all blacks power.
   ``In economics, there have been a lot of gains, but they've been
concentrated in the black middle class,'' said Clayborne Carson, a
Stanford University history professor and editor of the Martin
Luther King Papers Project.
   ``The group left out is the poor,'' he said. ``The irony is
that's who black power was supposed to help the most.''

   Here is a rundown of some 1960s black activists and where they
are today:
   _ H. Rap Brown, who said ``violence is as American as apple
pie,'' is now a devout Muslim known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. He
runs a convenience store in Atlanta.
   _ Huey P. Newton, who helped found the Black Panthers, lives in
Oakland, Calif., and says he lectures around the country about
``political philosophies'' and ``the realities of the 1960s.'' He
also said he is writing his memoirs.
   _ Eldridge Cleaver, one-time Panther information minister and
author of the acclaimed ``Soul On Ice,'' lives in Berkeley, Calif.
A Mormon and conservative Republican, Cleaver recently told Ebony
magazine he lectures to conservative groups and makes and sells
ceramic objects.
   In 1986, Cleaver unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination
for the U.S. Senate in California.
   Cleaver fled the country for several years in the late 1960s
after a shootout between the Panthers and the police. He told Ebony
that after spending time in China, Algeria and North Vietnam he
ended his advocacy of communism and ``developed an understanding
and respect for free enterprise and the democratic political
system.''
   _ Stokely Carmichael, a former chairman of the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, whose chant of ``black power''
became a slogan for a movement, is now known as Kwame Toure and
travels between Guinea and the United States, said Charles
Hamilton, a political science professor at Columbia University.
Hamilton and Carmichael wrote a book together.
   Toure is a full-time organizer for the All-African Peoples
Revolutionary Party, working toward Pan-African socialist
principles, Hamilton said. Pan-Africanism is the unity of all
people of African descent.
   _ Bobby Seale, who also helped organize the Panthers, is working
for Temple University in Philadelphia as a community liaison for
the department of African American studies and a recruiter for
students for the college of arts and sciences.
   _ Marion Barry, first chairman of SNCC, is mayor of Washington,
D.C.
   Barry once dressed in dashikis and urged blacks not to celebrate
the Apollo moon landing because ``white America's money and
technology'' had not reached the inner city.
   A former chemistry teacher, Barry went to Washington for SNCC
and worked as a fund-raiser. He later ran a job-training program,
Pride Inc., and served on the Washington school board and city
council.
   _ John Lewis, also a one-time SNCC chairman, is a Georgia
congressman. A former member of the Atlanta City Council, Lewis was
among those leading a line of 600 marchers to the Edmund Pettus
Bridge in Selma, Ala., where officers clubbed, tear-gassed and
bull-whipped blacks trying to march to Montgomery in March 1965.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ To be or not to be metric is perhaps our longest
national debate. A 1975 attempt to speed things along missed by a
mile. But 62 percent of Fortune 1,000 companies now make something
that's metric. If the meter has wedged a foot in the back door of
the nation, can the kilogram be far behind?

   Whatever became of the Indy 804.5 and the rest of the metric
system?
   ``The whole thing went away and died,'' says Ray Lloyd of the
Scale Manufacturers Association.
   He meant the 1975 act of Congress which was to have consigned
pounds, inches, rods, furlongs, picas, acres, gills, gallons, miles
per hour and their myriad cousins to the trash bin for a brave new
world of metrics. Officially, three bureaucrats, a secretary and a
$250,000 budget inside the huge Department of Commerce in
Washington are what remain of that vision of a metric America.
   But inch by inch the meter has wedged a foot in the back door of
the nation.
   Oh, a miss is still as good as a mile. Lovers still love, a
bushel and a peck, not a liter and a stere.
   But almost all American cars are built to metric measure. Booze
and wine come by the liter. Skis, film, pharmaceuticals are in
millimeters and grams. Edwin Moses runs the 400-meter hurdles.
Almost all grade-schoolers learn some metrics. ``Star Wars,'' when
and if, will be metric, as the Pentagon honorably discharges the
old measurements inherited from Great Britain where a yard was the
distance from Henry I's nose to the tip of his middle finger.
   Sixty-two percent of the Fortune 1,000 companies make something
that's metric. Thirty-four percent of their new products are. In
five or six years probably all packaged goods on supermarket
shelves will be labeled gram-liters as well as pound-ounces. Most
significantly, an omnibus trade bill to be voted on this spring by
Congress contains a provision requiring 42 agencies of the federal
government to basically go metric by September 30, 1993. That
includes the Department of Defense, the biggest buyer of them all.
In hearings last summer, no organized constituency opposed the
metric portion of the bill.
   Ask anyone who knows a hand (four inches) from a hectare: Will
America ever be metric? The invariable answer: inevitably. When?
Nobody can say. Congress is charged by the Constitution with
regulating weights and measures. Congress is Congress. And old
habits are old habits.
   In the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, Congress declared it the
policy of the United States to ``coordinate and plan ... the
VOLUNTARY (stress added) conversion to the metric system.''
   This bold pronouncement, toothless as a professional hockey
player, was akin to telling the nation's 4-year-olds: ``Eat your
broccoli because it's good for you, but you can stick to ice cream
if you want.'' Americans, by and large, preferred vanilla.
   To be or not to be metric is called America's longest debate.
Congress almost adopted the meter in 1896. But the nation's largest
trading partner, Britain and its empire, were pound-inches. The
United States went along.
   ``Inch-pounds led and lead the world because of the standards
and technology that support them,'' says Charles Wilson, director
of engineering for the Industrial Fastener Institute.
   By the 1960s, however, American industry was expanding overseas
into a largely metric world. In 1969 the United States exported $14
billion in measure-sensitive products and imported only $6 billion.
But by 1975 it was estimated the nation would suffer a $600 million
loss in foreign business because it was not metric.
   In 1971 the National Bureau of Standards, whose official yard
and pound are based on metric measure, completed a three-year study
of metrication. Two years later General Motors announced it would
make metric cars. The 1975 act originally set a 10-year schedule
for conversion. Heavy lobbying, particularly by trade unions and
small businesses, struck this out. While the act set up a 17-member
Metric Board, it was only empowered to ``publicize,''
``encourage,'' ``consult,'' ``assist.''
   ``How can you do something if it's not mandated?'' asks metric
hard-liner Louis Sokol, past president of the private U.S. Metric
Association. ``We don't make speed limits or the income tax
voluntary. The metric board just became a debating society.''
   ``We missed an opportunity 13 years ago,'' Gerald Underwood
concedes. His Office of Metric Programs _ that four-person
operation at the Commerce Department _ is what survives of the
Metric Board that once had 100 employees and a $3 million annual
budget. Ronald Reagan cut off its funds in 1982.
   ``Metrication should have been presented in terms of trade
instead of conformance,'' says Underwood. ``Focused on the
pocketbook instead of the agony of converting the housewife's
recipe book. But I believe in free enterprise rather than
government dictate.''
   ``We felt the enormity of the problem of conversion was
completely underestimated,'' says Bob Woods, research director for
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Machinists and carpenters would have to buy new tools. They'd be
fired for mismeasuring. Above all, foreign metric goods would pour
in.
   ``Of course, that's what happened anyway,'' says Sokol.
   Just what metric conversion nationally might cost seems
impossible to calculate. One unattributed estimate was $25 billion
over 30 years. The Pentagon has said it would cost the defense
industry $18 billion, three-fourths of that in the first 10 years.
The steel industry had a figure of $2 billion in 1973 but said
actuality was ``nothing close'' to the original estimate.
   ``The Ford Motor Company started with a metrication department
which became a section, then a group and then me,'' says George
Baumgartner, whose job as metric planner was done away with last
year. ``The cost was negligible. Everything is now metric except
the speedometer and tire rims. Our biggest problem is how to spell
liter. L-i-t-r-e?''
   ``GM found the accounting costs for conversion cost more than
conversion itself,'' says Sokol. The pharmaceutical industry, which
converted in the 1950s, said the cost was lower than expected and
produced savings through fewer mistakes, easier employee training
and improved records.
   Small businesses, on the other hand, don't have the economies of
scale.
   ``Machine tools can cost $2 million,'' says Wilson of the
Fastener Institute. ``Changing dies is very expensive, so you want
to make as many items as you can without having to tear the machine
up to make another size. The U.S. uses 200 billion fasteners a
year. It would cost billions to stock dual sizes.''
   John Deere, where Underwood was head of standards, spent
one-third the value of its shelf parts on annual inventory. ``Part
of that cost is insurance, space, heat, light. Standardization
reduces these costs. We used to have about 70 screw sizes.
Metrication reduced that to 12 or 15, which meant economies in
buying in bulk, number of bins and errors.

   ``For the nation it's almost impossible to figure a cost. But we
figure each $1 billion in manufacturing means 30,000 jobs. Anything
that metrication does to improve our international trade is then
part of that equation.''
   To purists, the late 1970s were the ``golden years'' of
metrication. Interstate highway signs announced distances in
miles-kilometers. Schools blossomed with colorful conversion
posters. Shell Oil spent $2 million converting 16,000 gas stations.
Sunrise, Fla., said it would go entirely metric to celebrate the
Bicentennial.
   Motorists immediately began ``screaming their heads off,'' says
the Federal Highway Administration. In 1978 Congress took the signs
down. Shell soon found metric gas pumps confused drivers and
converted back to gallons. When the National Geographic Society
started using metrics on maps and stories, some 70 readers said the
magazine had gone pinko and canceled their subscriptions.
   Metric zealots ``just kind of gave up and went looking for other
crusades,'' says Valerie Antoine, executive director of the U.S.
Metric Association.
   Metericians hoped the schools would incubate a metric America.
``But when the rest of society didn't keep pace, teachers said
`Hey, we got left out on a limb,''' says Leroy Negus, associate in
mathematics at the N.Y. State Department of Education.
   California said all its textbooks would be metric by 1985. They
aren't. But almost all schools in the country include some metric
instruction. October 10 _ get it? 10-10 _ still kicks off National
Metric Week.
   The effort is to get children to think metric as well as know
it, to know right off that 28 degrees Celsius is hot outside
without multiplying nine-fifths plus 32 to get Fahrenheit.
   Kent Ashworth of Educational Testing Service, the Princeton,
N.J., organization that gives Scholastic Aptitude Tests, says a
survey of 13-year-olds showed those who use metrics ``often''
outside class more than doubled _ 16 percent to 34 percent _
between 1978 and 1982.
   But in a 1981 test given internationally, American students
finished near the bottom in measurement skills.
   ``Children are taught both systems,'' says Sokol. ``They are
knowledgeable in both and proficient in neither.''
   As a ninth-grader wrote the late Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldridge: ``If you ask me it's confusing using both (systems) when
our nation could choose one ... Please keep this letter in
consideration and remember all of the confused kids in this
country.''
   Sokol worries, too, about adult education. Why did some
newspapers convert the 70- and 80-meter ski jump results at the
recent Calgary Winter Olympics to feet? Why, when President Reagan
clunked 14-pound Congressional bills on the dais in his recent
State of the Union address, didn't he call them 6.2-kilogram bills?
``What a wasted opportunity,'' bemoans Sokol.
   The United States stands alone with Burma as the only non-metric
holdouts in a kilogram world. Canada said in 1970 it would go
metric and did. Its metric commission disbanded in 1985. ``No
problems,'' says Francois Broeur of the Ministry of Consumer and
Corporate Affairs.
   He probably didn't talk to LaRae Willson, an American housewife
in Thunder Bay, Ont. ``Liters schmeeters. I just tell the man to
fill up the tank. I follow my butcher from Safeway to Safeway
because he'll sell me meat in pounds.''
   She admits to carrying a pound-kilo pocket converter. ``You
gotta eat.''
   Britain decided to go metric in 1972. Highway signs are still in
miles _ too costly to change _ and a pint of bitter mild is a pint
of bitter mild.
   Australia set a 10-year timetable and converted in eight. Japan
started metrication in 1921 and made it compulsory in 1951, saying
sayonara to the 11.93-inch shaku and 8.267-pound kan.
   In the United States, the meter's foreign birth is ``undoubtedly
a factor'' in resistance to it, Underwood acknowledged. ``But there
is an enormous explosion of technology in the world. It's taking
place everywhere, not just America. The upshot is international
collaboration, and the language of that collaboration is metric.''
   Measurement uncertainties can have immediate effects. There was
confusion at first over just what radiation units the Russians were
using to assess radiation levels at Chernobyl. A Canadian plane
crashed when it ran out of fuel after a refill mix-up. More
critical at a time of America's huge trade deficit is the fact that
10 percent of the nation's gross national product derives from
foreign commerce, two-thirds of that being measure-sensitive
products.
   If the 1975 Metric Act had no incisors and the University of
Michigan Survey Research Center says only 40 percent of Americans
can name even one metric unit, there is nonetheless a considerable
metric component in U.S. life.
   ``Sixty-five to 68 percent of supermarket goods are prepackaged
and 70 percent of that has metric labels,'' says George Carlton,
chairman of the Food and Grocery Coordinating Committee on
Metrication. ``The No. 2 can is standard worldwide. The consumer
knows how many kids a No. 2 can will feed. The rubber hits the road
when the housewife meets the retailer at the meat counter and pays
2.205 times as much for a kilo of hamburger than she paid for a
pound.''
   But wine went metric in 1978 and hard liquor in 1980. Soft
drinks have gone to two-liter bottles with no reading on the
Richter scale.
   ``If a commodity is desired, it doesn't matter if it's packaged
in Swahili,'' says Al Navas, president of the National Metric
Council in Washington. ``Metric transition is going to come about
product by product.''
   Cars are easy because new models are always being introduced.
Machine-like drill presses are adjustable by definition. Many small
businesses will make whatever their customers want.
   Some think American industry will be predominantly metric by the
turn of the century. Wilson thinks it will take 75 years.
   Market forces will probably be more determining than the
government.
   ``Metrics never elected a senator,'' says Navas. ``It isn't
liberal-conservative or Republican-Democrat. It's apolitical. I was
on a radio talk show in Detroit recently, and they cut me off after
25 minutes. No one was calling in to protest metrics.''
   Probably the bell cow in metric transition will be the Pentagon
with its 300,000 suppliers in the defense industry and 15 million
contracts a year. The Army's multibillion-dollar LHX helicopter
will be metric. So will ``Star Wars.''
   Last September the Defense Department said its policy was to use
metric ``in all of its activities consistent with security . . .
technical, logistical and safety requirements.'' Any deviation has
to be cleared by senior officials. Fourteen percent of defense
standards are already metric.
   Partially this is the result of the U.S. alliance in an
otherwise metric NATO. ``But we're talking about the equipment
we'll be fighting with into the 21st century,'' says Air Force Col.
Thomas Mansperger, Pentagon metric coordinating officer. ``We base
it on what we see our future needs will be and what kind of world
we're going to work in.''
   A metric world.

   The metric system was born in the French Revolution, which also
tried _ and failed _ to create the 10-day week.
   The intent was to give the citizen a fairer shake with weights
and measures than the honesty of a merchant's thumb on the scale.
The Paris Academy of Sciences decided to base the system on a
constant physical dimension, in this case, one ten-millionth of the
arc from the North Pole to the Equator on a meridian passing
through Paris. That unit was to be called a meter, from the Greek
word metron for ``measure.''
   The liter was to be the volume of a cube one-tenth meter on a
side. The gram: the weight of pure water at a certain temperature
in a cube one-hundredth of a meter on a side. All variations of
these basic measurements were to be to the base 10 to simplify
their use in arithmetic.
   Almost at once the meter was in hot water. Surveyors measuring
the distance on the meridian from Dunkirk to Barcelona used white
flags as markers. White was the color of the monarchists who were
soon to see their king beheaded. The surveyors kept having to talk
their way out of jail, explaining they were just inventing the
metric system, not showing support for Louis XVI.
   The Paris Assembly adopted their work in 1791. Thomas Jefferson
proposed a similar decimal system a few years later when he was
secretary of state.
   The French made metrics mandatory in 1840. The U.S. Congress
declared the system legal in 1866. In 1875 the Treaty of the Meter
was signed by the United States and 16 other nations creating an
International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris.
   Since 1893 the American yard and pound have been based on the
meter and kilogram. But the United States has yet to officially
convert to metrics. It and Burma are the only nations in the world
not to have done so.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Some of the old color is returning to Miami
Beach, the art deco treasure-trove that had fallen on hard times.
Now, affluent young people are rediscovering the district, lured by
refurbished buildings with their pastel-painted accents and
distinctive, geometric designs.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A painstaking facelift of the historic
but seedy southern tip of Miami Beach appears to be more than skin
deep.
   City officials are working to ensure the project's success and
younger, more affluent tenants keep moving in.
   Not long ago, investors remained leery of the run-down area,
uncertain whether it could be turned around by refurbishing
historic buildings that were crumbling around the edges and cloaked
in layers 
   When the city began spurring renovation, inspectors forced
landlords to upgrade apartments and limit the number of residents
per dwelling, according to Jud Kurlancheek, director of planning.
That, along with new interest by young professionals, drove up
prices.
   While the city doesn't keep track of the ethnicity of its
residents, Kurlancheek says the post-World War II Eastern European
immigrants who retired to Miami Beach from New York and Chicago
weren't replaced. Generally, he says, the advent of condominiums
and planned retirement communities elsewhere in South Florida
curtailed Miami Beach's image as a retirement haven.
   The reaction among those who have stayed has been mixed. Some
complain that they've been priced out of their homes, while others
welcome the revitalization.
   For Saul Gross, a New Yorker who began investing in the area
three years ago, when many were still unconvinced of the district's
potential, the payoff has been big.
   ``Everybody told me I was crazy at the time,'' says Gross,
president of the beach-based Streamline Development Co. ``It turns
out I have 175 apartments and 165 of those leased in the past year
at higher rents than anybody ever thought.''
   Gross' holdings now include 11 apartment buildings and 25,000
square feet of commercial property being renovated on Washington
Avenue, which cuts through the heart of the district with an area
of about a square mile.
   Out-of-town investors in particular have taken more of an
interest in the district, acquiring a number of the 800 or so art
deco structures. Local investors have not been as quick to jump in.
   Some say that could soon be changing.
   Chuck Lennon, executive director of the Builders Association of
South Florida, says local builders are geared more to large,
planned developments on virgin tracts of land. As less land becomes
available, builders are likely to turn more readily to refurbishing
projects, he says.
   City officials are doing their part to lure local investors.
Recently, they staged a two-day seminar for members of the powerful
Latin Builders Association to promote investment possibilities on
the beach.
   To protect and promote one of its most popular sections, the
city recently passed an amendment to its historic preservation
ordinance that gives officials the option of imposing a permanent
moratorium on demolition of significant buildings.
   The initial 1982 ordinance only provided for a six-month delay
in demolition, little more than ``a delaying factor, or
cooling-off'' period to try and convince buyers of historic
buildings not to raze them, Singer says.
   A 10-month project will begin in March to enhance pedestrian
traffic on Ocean Drive, where deco hotels fronting the ocean have
become a symbol of the rebirth. Sidewalks will be widened to 15
feet, three times their current width, and ocean-side Lummus Park
will be spruced up.
   Stuart Rogel, director of economic and community development,
says he recognizes the art deco district as ``a source of pride and
reason for attracting people to our city, whether they come to
visit or live in the buildings. ... It's an important area for the
city.''
   Although only about 10 percent of the deco-style buildings have
been renovated, progress has picked up in recent years, says
Richard Hoberman, president of the Miami Design Preservation League.
   ``In the past two years, more than half the properties on Ocean
(Drive) and Collins (Avenue) have changed hands,'' Hoberman says.
   ``The direction of things six years ago was that everything was
on the decline,'' says Denis Russ, executive director of the Miami
Beach Development Corp., a private, non-profit group. ``Now there
is occurring here the development of a neighborhood fabric.''
   Younger, more affluent tenants are moving into the refurbished
apartments, which now rent for up to $850 for a two-bedroom unit,
Ms. Meyers says. The average vacancy rate of redone buildings is
about 10 percent, a significant drop from a high of 30 percent
among buildings not yet renovated.
   Meanwhile, apartment buildings in need of upgrading, which five
years ago sold for about $12,000 a unit, now command up to $20,000,
Ms. Meyers says. Hotels that used to sell for about $6,000 a room,
are going for up to $20,000, especially along the ocean.
   ``We are experiencing a change, a revitalization, a recycling
and this will be a continuing phenomenom,'' Russ says. ``I think
it's not measured in weeks or seasons, but years. It won't reach
the peak of its happening for another 10 years.''
   Ms. Meyers says the increased activity is snowballing.
   ``We're not yet out of the woods,'' she says, ``but if the
pattern continues, we'll see tremendous change in three years.''

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new generation has discovered
``America's Riviera,'' replacing the glitz and glamour that faded
decades ago with rock music clubs, quaint restaurants and
neighborhood bars.
   Instead of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Jerry Lewis or others
who frequented Miami Beach in the '50s and '60s, recent visitors
saw Mick Taylor and Ron Wood, Rolling Stones past and present, at
Woody's On The Beach. Others heard Stephen Stills and Savoy Brown
at the China Club, where Doobie Brothers jammed with Steely Dan,
and where rocker David Bowie, tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis and
former Beatles' producer George Martin were among the crowd.
   ``The night life plays a great role in the revitalization of the
entire community,'' says Mayor Alex Daoud, 44, a Miami Beach native
who can recall passing Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Kirk Douglas on
the streets of his youth.
   ``One of the largest concerns people have is: `Where can I go at
night?' When I was growing up here, entertainment was very
expensive. Now we have more affordable entertainment, and also
family-oriented entertainment.''
   In less than five years, nearly 20 music clubs and restaurants
have sprung up in formerly rundown hotels, some deserted, others
occupied by the elderly poor or Mariel Cuban refugees.
   The first time David Giles, a British-born investment
consultant, walked into the future site of Woody's, ``there were
six guys on the floor doing crack cocaine. It was absolutely
derelict.''
   Months later, Giles, 37, welcomed 600 people who paid $100 to
$150 each to attend a New Year's Eve opening featuring the music of
Wood, a minority investor in a European ownership group assembled
by Giles.
   ``I still don't know if it will sustain itself, but the area
appears to have turned a corner,'' says Giles, who plans to expand
his club into a beach club with sauna, exercise facilities and a
gallery showcasing Wood's artwork.
   Jud Kurlancheek, city director of planning and zoning, says the
night life is ``a magnet for things that happen. It gets people to
come here, and they look around and decide they'd like to live
here.''
   Unlike in suburbia, where entertainment follows residential
development, the reverse appears true in urban areas, Kurlancheek
says.
   In the art deco district undergoing restoration as a national
historic area, the first wave brought upscale restaurants such as
the European-style cafe The Strand, and trendy music clubs such as
China Club, Woody's, Club Nu and the Tropics International. Now,
the neighborhood is adding the trappings of a settled-in
professional community: a sushi restaurant, chummy neighborhood
bars, an art deco-style Burger King and, soon, Domino's Pizza,
McDonald's and Wendy's fast-food restaurants.
   The average age of Miami Beach's 100,000 people dropped from 66
in 1980 to 54 in 1985 and is projected to be under 50 by 1980, says
Kurlancheek.
   ``Young people are happy to live blocks from the beach,'' says
Jeffrey Cohen, a partner in the China Club. ``The weather has
always been the finest on the continent and now, with the
resurgence of the young people, it's like a rediscovery.''
   The shift in entertainment tastes and the onset of jet travel to
the Caribbean and other competing resorts spelled the end to Miami
Beach's heyday in the '60s, Beach veterans say. The South Beach
area was hitting bottom by the time thousands of jobless Cubans
from the 1980 Mariel boatlift crowded in with the elderly Eastern
European immigrants who couldn't afford the condominium retirement
communities springing up in South Florida.
   Two efforts to gain legalization of casino gambling failed.
Finally, developers stopped looking for the ``quick fix'' and
instead concentrated on more lasting solutions such as widening the
eroded beach from 15 feet in places to 300, adding a boardwalk and
reviving interest in preserving art deco styles. At the same time,
tougher zoning ordinances forced landlords to make costly
improvements. The higher rents that resulted helped chase away many
of those responsible for raising the crime rates.
   Many involved in the night life comeback are people in their 30s
and 40s who have been interested in Miami Beach redevelopment for
years. Woody Graber, a Buffalo-born publicist who's been working
for redevelopment and art deco preservation since 1979, says he's
finally confident.
   ``People are finally realizing the potential. It's sort of like
helping people find a buried treasure,'' Graber says. ``This isn't
going to die; there's too much going on for it to die now.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Cruise ships are notorious for their food. Not
the quality, the quantity. Elaborate meals are served several times
a day, right up to the midnight buffet. The head chef of one such
ship, who's in charge of getting all that food to the table, shows
what goes on in the galley.

<TEXT>
   The problem of the latter-day galley
slaves in a storm at sea was posed by the poet-passenger Rudyard
Kipling, who often hung over the rail in a heaving sea:
   ``When the cabin portholes are dark and green
   ``Because of the seas outside,
   ``When the ship goes WOP (with a wiggle between)
   ``And the steward falls into the soup tureen,
   ``And the trunks begin to slide...
   ``Why, then you will know (if you haven't guessed)
   ``You're 50 North and 40 West.''
   That would be well off Newfoundland. Gerd Tschampel has survived
several howling storms in even more northern latitudes, like off
Spitzbergen and Norway's North Cape, without falling into the soup
tureen.
   As head chef on the 10,000-ton West German liner MV Berlin, now
sailing off Brazil, Gerd knows that in a really big blow, more
accidents happen in the kitchen than anywhere else on board.
   ``We have a saying about storms at sea,'' he says. ``If
something is falling, don't stop it. Don't try to catch it. Get out
of the way. Better to lose the soup or the sauce than suffer a
scald.''
   On the relatively calm equator it was near time for the first
dinner seating. Gerd was moving down the line, as they call the row
of hissing pots and pans, sampling the various dishes with a large
serving spoon.
   ``This is usually the only meal I have time to take,'' he said
between slurps that occasionally provoked a sprinkle of salt or
paprika from the palm of his hand. ``A taste of this and a sip of
that, which means I am really eating all the time. Thank God, from
the beginning I have been a good sailor with no worries about rough
weather.''
   For Gerd, just turned 35, the beginning was when his cousin came
to their home in Windsbach, northern Bavaria, with armloads of
exotic souvenirs from all over the world.
   ``Junk mostly, I suppose, like I collect now,'' Gerd laughed,
``but I was l6 years old then and he was a chef on the Kungsholm,
traveling everywhere. I made up my mind to someday roam the globe
like him behind a stove.''
   He apprenticed at a small hotel in Ansbach, near Nuremberg, with
a gourmet dining room frequented by American Air Force personnel
from a nearby base. Going to catering school three weeks a year and
passing certification tests, as is required in West Germany, Gerd
rose to the rank of sous-chef.
   His dream became a reality via a classified ad in a restaurant
trade paper. The German liner Berlin was looking for qualified
kitchen help.
   ``I applied for third cook, the lowest rank. A month later I was
looking out a porthole at Jakarta,'' Gerd recalls. ``My cousin
meanwhile was chef on the ferry from Kiel to Goteborg. His wife
said, `Enough.'''
   Three years later, Gerd, now head chef, has learned to cope with
the biggest difference between cooking on land and at sea. ``At the
hotel, if you forget something, you pick up the telephone. Out
here, you forget something, forget it. You have nothing.''
   Fresh fruit and vegetables are always a problem for the growing
number of cruise ships of many flags that spend the winter in the
tropics.
   ``The other day we were in Martinique,'' Gerd says, shaking his
head over his menu-planning clipboard. ``You think Caribbean ports
could supply all the melons, fish and shrimp you need. Then you
telex ahead for 900 kilos of something and they can only come up
with 200 kilos. Right now we have too many tomatoes and not enough
cucumbers. You learn to be versatile.''

<TEXT>
   The following morning, the Berlin would dock at Belem, 90 miles
up the Amazon, where Gerd expected five tons of food to be winched
aboard, ``if the agent can locate it.'' Some supplies would be
flown out from West Germany where weeks before Christmas the ship
had left its home port of Neustadt, near Hamburg, with enough food
in its freezers to last three months.
   ``The other big difference about cooking at sea,'' says Gerd,
dipping his spoon into an enormous tray of red snapper simmering in
almond butter, ``is that everything is served all at once, not like
in a restaurant where orders may come hours apart. ''
   To feed 450 passengers and 200 crew members, Gerd supervises a
staff of 26 that includes a sous-chef, a bread baker, four
butchers, two pastry chefs and assorted specialists at meat, fish,
soups, sauces, salads and ice cream-making.
   Eating is a round-the-clock pastime for passengers. Breakfast
starts at 7 a.m. in the dining salon or at poolside. Hot bouillon
at 10. Lunch is at noon in the dining room or on the Lido deck.
Afternoon tea with rich pastry is at 4. There are two dinner
sittings, at 6 and 8, then an elaborate midnight buffet.
   ``When people, sometimes even the captain and the doctor,
complain to me about getting too thick, too fat, I tell them, look,
I only do the cooking. You must do the eating,'' says the lean and
lanky chef.
   Gerd's day is divided into two shifts. He shows up in the
gleaming tile and steel galley at 6 a.m., takes a break at noon for
a few hours, then is back on the line at 5 or so. ``In this job, ''
he says, sampling the just-made kiwi fruit ice cream with hazelnut
sauce, ``you know when you start but you never know when you
finish. Sometimes it is midnight.''
   Menus are planned two days ahead, after a nervous look at the
larder.
   ``On a cruise ship, the chef learns to pace himself, so that
each day is better than the last,'' Gerd says. The progression is
from venison and filet mignon to boeuf Wellington and lobster, from
pate de foie gras to smoked salmon to caviar. It all builds to the
captain's farewell banquet, when the lamps are dimmed and the
waiters come marching in behind the ship's orchestra with flaming
baked Alaska held proudly on high.
   Then in ritual rich as King Neptune's court at the crossing of
the equator, the captain gives his little speech and introduces his
officers and the cruise staff. But the loudest applause always
rings out for the chef.
   Since the Berlin flies the West German flag, the menu at lunch
usually features a regional specialty like gefuellte kalbsbrust
Heidelberg, stuffed breast of veal, or Kaiserschmarren, luscious
Tyrolean pancakes. The six-course dinner, from pate and soup to
cheese board and exotic pastry, invariably offers a choice of three
entrees.
   The cuisine is continental, but menu choices do not seem to vary
regardless of whether German, French or Americans predominate the
passenger list. With some 400 guests studying his daily
delectations, Gerd can predict ``within 20 or 30 portions'' which
of the three entrees will be the most in demand.
   ``That way, we don't waste much food,'' he says. ``Also, the
weather is a factor. People eat less here in the tropics. On the
chilly North Cape run, they never stop eating.''
   In the pecking order at sea, Gerd is entitled to wear an
officer's uniform with three stripes on the sleeve, the equivalent
rank of first mate or first engineer. But he prefers a white apron
and the toque blanche, the tall chef's hat that crowns his
profession and always brings down the house.
   ``In Germany,'' he mused over a steaming cauldron of crab and
spinach soup, ``cooking is still a respected profession, but young
people don't want it. The hours are too long, the work too hard,
and you're never off on weekends, Christmas or Easter. Every cruise
I am breaking in four or five new cooks. They stay for two or three
years, and then the wife or the girlfriend says enough. Well, you
can't blame them. The sea is for dreamers.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Camel caravans still wend across the Sahara
Desert in northern Niger as they have done for centuries, but
droughts in this decade have wiped out most livestock herds,
putting an end to the wandering of the nomadic Tuaregs. In villages
such as Agadez, many have been reduced to hawking jewelry to
tourists or scratching a meager garden out of the sand.

<DATELINE>AGADEZ, Niger (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The evening call to prayer from a medieval
minaret echoes through the sand streets to a market stall next to
the sultan's palace where Abdou Amadou sells nomad souvenirs and
dreams of Hondas.
   The souvenirs are mere remnants of a fabulous desert culture
that once flourished in Agadez, then a bustling crossroad of the
great trans-Saharan trade.
   The village is now an impoverished outpost in the landlocked
West African nation of Niger, one of the poorest and most anonymous
countries on Earth. But Agadez manages to survive, living off the
legacy of the Sahara's golden age.
   Abdou, 16, is watching the shop while his grandfather prays on a
straw mat outside in the street. Two tourists browse through the
sabers, jewelry and camel saddles hanging on the wall.
   ``It's nomad,'' Abdou says, pointing to a bracelet. ``It's
silver. I'll make you a good price.''
   As the tourists walk away, Abdou says in French, ``I want to
sell enough to buy a Honda someday and do a motorcross. It would be
marvelous.'' His grandfather returns and, speaking quietly in
Tamanjek, tells Abdou to get back to work.
   Tamanjek is the language of the Tuareg nomads, who for a
thousand years lived and wandered in the once-borderless Sahara
Desert that is now northern Niger.
   Crafts and caravans, as well as tourism, are essential
structural supports for the economy of northern Niger, a country
with a population of about 7 million and an average per capita
income of $270 a year.
   The caravan route to Timbuktu originated in Agadez and was
followed by Arabs, Turks and Egyptians. The wealthy traders of the
medieval world, including a few Europeans, kept agents in Agadez to
expedite the flow of goods south to Black Africa and north to the
Mediterranean ports.
   The gateway to the Sahara, Agadez linked Europe and Africa,
white world and black; the route came to symbolize the mystery of
Africa.
   Throughout the Middle Ages and continuing until two centuries
ago, huge caravans crisscrossed the desert waste. Sometimes lines
of up to 40,000 camels stretched to the shimmering horizon. Tuareg
nomads, proud and independent, served as escorts, camel handlers
and guides across the unmarked sand. Nomad craftsmen made saddles,
sabers and other gear for the trail while other Tuaregs bred camels
to replace those lost to exhaustion and thirst.
   Crossing the desert was a complicated and dangerous business.
Tens of thousands of human and animal skeletons lie buried beneath
the sand. Whole convoys died from lack of water or heat or fell
victim to bandits. Black Africans perished on the forced march
north to slavery or were worked to death more slowly in the desert
salt pits.
   The pits not far from Agadez, near the Libyan border, are still
being worked, although not by slaves, and the transport still is
handled in the cool winter months by camel caravans. Scores of
caravans carry salt to feed the livestock of farmers in the more
fertile south. To the north they return with millet, dates and
wheat.
   Caravans appear suddenly from behind dunes like an illustration
from Arabian Nights or frames from a Hollywood Foreign Legion film.
The camels glide across the top of dunes, tied in a line, their
hooves trailing plumes of sand. Beside them walk the nomads in
robes that billow like sails in the wind. From their belts swing
curved, carved sabers, symbols of the Tuaregs' warrior past.
   The caravan trade still feeds some families, but many Tuaregs in
Agadez have been reduced to hawking jewelry to tourists or
scratching a meager garden out of the sand. Droughts in this decade
have wiped out most herds, putting an end to the nomad's wandering
and livelihood. Government policies that encourage the nomads to
settle down have accelerated the change to a sedentary life.

<HEAD>AGADEZ, Niger: sedentary life.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The descendant of a line that dates at least to the 10th
century, Sultan Ibrahim spent one recent morning negotiating movie
rights to film a caravan.
   The sultan reclined on a carpet by an open fire in the dark
palace, slowly spinning a silver cylinder of snuff in his hand.
Across from him on lawn chairs sat a reporter and producer from the
British Broadcasting Co., nervously negotiating.
   They explained their plan to an old, white-robed interpreter who
translated it from French for the sultan and his retinue. The
sultan's black eyes, the only part of his head not concealed by an
abundant turban, revealed nothing but inscrutable reserve.
   After a while he raised his hand and discussion of details
ceased between the BBC and a barefoot caravaner. He approved 30
camels and agreed to outfit the caravan for a reasonable price _
and agreed to be interviewed on camera for the trade route film.
   ``Thirty camels can go now without danger,'' the sultan says.
``It is no longer necessary to travel in large groups for
protection.''
   The danger facing Agadez these days, he says, is not other men,
but nature.
   ``It is getting drier, the water table is falling and we have
not had a good rain in two years,'' he says. ``It is difficult to
say exactly what is happening.
   ``We have enough water for the moment for our 30,000 people and
there is enough fodder, but any further loss of pasture and there
will be no livestock left. I don't know about will happen to the
people.''
   The spread of the Sahara is the biggest problem in Agadez, in
the region, in all of Niger. Desertification and the environment
was the top priority listed by the new government when it took over
in November. The new chief of state is Ali Seibou, the third man to
lead Niger since it gained independence from France three decades
ago.
   Col. Seibou, leader of the Nigerien military, took over Nov. 17
from President Seyna Kountche, who died in a Paris hospital of a
brain tumor. Seibou immediately was chosen to head the seven-man
ruling Supreme Military Council.
   Already known for his leadership in efficiently distributing
food throughout Niger during the 1984 famine, Seibou increased his
popularity by releasing about 200 political prisoners and reducing
police presence in Niamey, the capital. Articles mildly critical of
the government began appearing in the press. The atmosphere seemed
looser, people said.
   The transition of power was especially smooth when compared to
other West African nations, where violent coups d'etat often mark
the change in government. Niger's reputation for stability has been
strengthened in international circles, including the United States.
   International affairs, even national ones, receive little
attention in Agadez, where there are only a couple of television
sets and one plane a week lands on the sand-swept airstrip near
town. Tradition is what matters.
   Even the way of saying hello on the street is rooted in the
Sahara's golden age. The Tuareg have a complicated and courteous
way of greeting each other, exchanging several phrases before
conversation begins. Softly spoken, ritualistic phrases, which
everyone knows by heart, sometimes go on for a minute or more.
   ``Salum alaikum,'' they begin. Peace to you.
   ``Alaikum wa salam.'' Peace to you too.
   ``Yak lo bas.'' No evil to you.
   ``Lo bas.'' No evil.
   ``Lo bas. Hamdullah.'' No evil, thanks to God.
   As the phrases continue, the men look each other over. The
ritual was useful for sizing up a stranger on the desert,
identifying his tribe.
   Abdou, sporting a Georgia Historical Society T-shirt given to
him by a foreign friend, thinks the greeting is old-fashioned. But
he respects the ancient traditions, knowing that this is what
brings the tourists to his grandfather's shop.
   ``You want to go see the camel market outside town?'' he asks a
visitor. ``I can borrow my brother's motorcycle and take you
there.''

   Here are some facts and figures on Niger:
   THE LAND: Located on the southern edge of the Sahara, between
Libya and Nigeria, Niger is a landlocked nation of 490,000 square
miles (the size of Texas and California combined), most of it
uninhabited desert.
   More than a century of French colonial rule ended peacefully on
Aug. 8, 1960. The Nigeriens adopted a constitution three months
later that was suspended following a military coup in 1974.
   THE PEOPLE: The population, estimated at 7 million, is largely
made up of three ethnic groups. The Hausa, who also constitute the
major ethnic group of northern Nigeria, represent half the total
population and the Djerma-Songhai, a quarter. Most are concentrated
in the southern, more fertile, part of the country. The rest of the
Nigeriens are nomadic or seminomadic peoples wandering the deserts
of the north, including the Tuareg, Fulani, Kanouri and Toubou.
Each ethnic group has its own language and customs but the Hausa
language is the one most widely spoken. Ninety-eight percent of the
population is Moslem. The birthrate is one of the world's highest,
increasing at 3.4 percent per year. The average life expectancy is
45.
   THE ECONOMY: Despite the development of uranium mining in recent
years, Niger remains a very poor country, 97 percent covered in
sand. Uranium output peaked in 1981 and declined after prices fell
owing to worldwide cuts in nuclear power programs. The falling
uranium prices caused the rate of economic growth to plummet from
12 percent in 1979 to 4.2 percent in 1985.
   Niger's gross national product per head declined, in real terms,
by an average of 1.6 percent annually between 1960 and 1981. Per
capita income in 1987 was estimated at $270 a year. The decline in
the economy combined with an exploding population and recurring
drought. Niger is thought to be the country that was most severely
affected by the 1984 drought and resulting food shortages.
   About 90 percent of Niger's work force is employed in some form
of agriculture or herding. The principal food crops are millet and
sorghum. The main cash crops are peanuts, cotton and cowpeas.
   HISTORY: The British were the first to explore the upper reaches
of the Niger River, beginning with the Scotsman Mungo Park, who
disappeared there in 1806. But it was the French who colonized it
between 1891 and 1911. The country was not fully ``pacified'' until
much later and there were a number of resistance movements which
challenged colonial power, the most serious being the siege of
Agadez by Tuareg nomad warriors in 1916-17.
   Its colonial history and development paralleled that of other
French West African territories, administered from Paris through
the governor general at Dakar, Senegal, and governors in the
individual territories. The country gained independence in 1960,
but remained staunchly pro-French.
   The constitution adopted in 1960 was suspended in April 1974
following a coup in which Seyni Kountche ousted Hamani Diori, who
had served since independence but was accused of corruption,
particularly with regard to the distribution of food aid.
   In November 1987, Kountche died in a Paris hospital following a
long illness and was immediately replaced by his chief aide and the
head of the 4,000-man Nigerien military, Ali Seibou.
   The country has been ruled since 1974 by a Supreme Military
Council and all basic powers have been vested in it. Political
parties are banned. A cabinet, composed of both civilians and
military personnel, administers the country. The government has
promised to reinstate a constitution and parliament.
   Niger pursues a neutral, moderate foreign policy and maintains
friendly relations with both East and West.

   British actress Jane Seymour says she found
much to admire in Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee who became
the duchess of Windsor, the woman the English loved to hate.
   ``She was the woman who stole their king,'' says Seymour, who
portrays Simpson in the CBS movie, ``The Woman He Loved.''
   ``They hated her. She was a naive American who didn't understand
the monarchy or how it worked or what it stood for. She thought
David could make her his queen.''
   Instead, David, already King Edward VIII but not yet crowned,
was forced to abdicate in 1936 to marry Wallis. They became the
duke and duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in
exile.
   The two-hour movie, which CBS will televise on Sunday, also
stars Anthony Andrews as David, Olivia de Havilland as Wallis' Aunt
Bessie, Julie Harris as her mother, Lucy Gutteridge as another
woman who saw herself as David's queen, Robert Hardy as Winston
Churchill and Phyllis Calvert as Queen Mary.
   ``I've never heard anyone say a good word about her,'' Seymour
says. ``Other than that, she gave great dinner parties. But I liked
her. She had a sense of humor, a straightforwardness. She was
definitely attentive to her husband and, although she was no
beauty, she had style and elegance. I certainly wouldn't trust her
with my husband.
   ``It's boring to play a perfect person. But to play a woman who
was not liked and to find something about her that is likeable is
fascinating.''
   Seymour says she saw David as a weak man who never really wanted
to be king. Wallis Simpson fulfilled some of his needs.
   ``Rumor has it that Wallis learned to do sexual tricks when she
lived in China,'' she says. ``The king had a few problems in that
area and she fixed them.''
   When Wallis first met David, he was the prince of Wales and she
was married to American businessman Ernest Simpson. The flirtation
turned to romance, and Simpson's marriage to divorce. Her plan was
to marry David and become queen, but the British prime minister and
royal family forbade his marriage as king to a twice-divorced woman.
   ``The Woman He Loved'' takes a different and less political
approach than the British-made miniseries ``Edward and Mrs.
Simpson,'' which ran on PBS several years ago.
   English newspapers became heavily involved with the making of
``The Woman He Loved'' and Seymour says one paper seemed to give
royal status to her role-playing. The Times published Seymour's
picture as the duchess at David's funeral. It went on the Court
Circular Page, a serious chronicle of royal events.
   ``I tried to play her in various shades of gray,'' Seymour says.
``I play her the way I believe she was thinking at the time. She
was manipulating things. She had a great plan and it didn't work. I
purposely don't play her sympathetically.''
   Parts of the movie were filmed in western England, where Seymour
owns a 15th-century estate outside the old Roman spa city of Bath.
She stayed at her home, St. Catherine's Court, during that time.
   Seymour divides her time between England, where she is still a
citizen, and this country, where she has lived for the past 10
years. She and her husband, American businessman David Flynn, have
two children, Katie, 5, born here, and Sean, 2, born in England.
   She works mostly in American television and films, having shed
her English accent in order to play American roles.
   Seymour was on her way to Spain to play opera star Maria Callas
in the ABC miniseries ``Onassis: The Richest Man in the World.''
The four-hour miniseries, which tells of the romance between Callas
and Greek magnate Aristotle Onassis (Raul Julia), will be televised
in early May.
   She has already completed her role as Natalie Jastrow Henry in
``War and Remembrance,'' the 30-hour miniseries being readied for
ABC next season. So far she has starred in 10 American miniseries.
   ``This seems to be my `duchess and diva' period,'' she says with
a laugh. ``I seem to be getting some great roles now. It's very
exciting. I'm like a chameleon, changing the way I look, the way I
sound, the kind of roles I play.''
   She took over the role played by Ali MacGraw in ``The Winds of
War,'' the first of author Herman Wouk's two massive novels on
World War II.
   For her role as Maria Callas she had to learn to sing several
arias. She also worked with dialect coach Robert Easton for her
roles as Wallis Simpson and Maria Callas.
   Next, she goes to London for a role in the CBS miniseries ``Jack
the Ripper.'' She plays the romantic interest to Michael Caine, who
stars as Scotland Yard Inspector Frederick Abberline. Armand
Assante also stars as an American actor playing ``Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde'' on the London stage at the time of Jack the Ripper's
reign of terror.

   Liliane Montevecchi is a French singer-dancer
whose cabaret show, ``On the Boulevard,'' opened in February and
keeps getting extended at the tiny off-Broadway Kaufman Theater.
   Whether she will let it extend into the summer, she can't say.
``I don't make plans. I do whatever pleases me.
   ``I'm like a cork on the ocean and just let it ride,'' she says
in French- accented English, her words punctuated by a hearty laugh.
   Her father was Italian, her mother French. She grew up in Paris.
She was the star of the Folies Bergere for 10 years. Minus the
feathers of the Folies, she's doing her first one-woman show.
   In ``On the Boulevard,'' she wears a black long-sleeved,
mini-skirted dress, accenting her gamine face, svelte figure and
shapely legs. After intermission, for a ``boulevard stroll,'' she
belts on a very French-looking trench coat. She bought it for $25
in a Salvation Army store near the Manhattan apartment where she's
staying. This ``cork on the ocean'' doesn't keep a permanent
apartment in Paris or New York.
   The songs in the show, sung mostly in English, aren't all
French. But the singer, whose name is pronounced Montevekky, makes
``It Might as Well Be Spring'' sound as French as ``Autumn Leaves.''
   Critic Clive Barnes called her ``an American-styled, but never
Americanized, impression of a reality that is itself so brilliant,
so telling and so touching that it becomes a new and lovely reality
in its own right.''
   Tommy Tune, who chose Miss Montevecchi for ``Nine'' on Broadway,
planned ``On the Boulevard'' with her, but his name isn't in the
program. She says, ``He did it for me as a friend. The critics were
so good he should have the recognition he deserves. I asked him and
he said, `Now that you're well on your way, do what you want.' It
is so brilliantly pulled together in that little theater, not an
easy theater to work with.
   ``The first time we came to the theater and sat there, he said,
`I see you higher.' We didn't know how yet. A boulevard was not
even thought of.'' They eventually decided on a raised, diagonal
walkway across the tiny stage.
   ``We were there, moved around, thought aloud, did boo-boos. It
was being unafraid to do things that are not good, then clean it
up. I always rehearse in a black leotard; I can see where the body
goes. We started with a leotard covered with diamonds I had from a
long time ago, for the show. It was too much.''
   They didn't try for a single mood, like nostalgia. ``We should
have variety,'' she says. ``Alive, alive, alive. And true. You
cannot cheat the public. They don't know why but they feel when it
is true. The public is very intelligent, you see.''
   Miss Montevecchi thinks her singing has improved. ``Life makes
you different, the sorrow, joy, people you lose. The songs are
closer to my heart and I'm not afraid any more. Tommy and I say we
are finished to be afraid. Now we attack!
   ``Tommy decided no more hats or glittering gowns. I attack with
pleasure. I feel very comfortable with that. I took a risk, I
guess. If one doesn't take a risk, one stays in a rut.''
   Tune first saw and heard the 5-foot-6-inch dancer-singer during
auditions for Broadway's ``Nine,'' which he directed.
   She had played in Atlantic City for 18 months, on contracts
renewed in three-month increments. From Atlantic City, she went to
Hollywood, where she once had a seven-year MGM contract, to try to
re-enter films.
   ``I didn't get a thing, not even a radio spot. I can't wait. I
try and if it doesn't work, I disappear. I decided to go back to
Paris. I stopped here, to visit a friend, and called my agent. He
said, `It's funny you called. Tomorrow there's an audition for a
play which requires accents.'
   ``I went there. I was not prepared at all. I didn't have a
pianist. I sang `La Vie en Rose.' Tommy liked me. He didn't have a
part for me but he wanted me in the show. Why not have me play the
part of a producer originally written for a man? Because of me, the
cast, except for Raul Julia, became all women.
   ``The timing of things is incredible.''
   In Paris, at age 9, Miss Montevecchi started ballet lessons,
sent by a mother who had wanted to be a ballerina. ``She didn't
push me too hard. I loved it. I still love it today. I go to ballet
class every day. It is my drug, my equilibrium, my love, what makes
me breathe.''
   Roland Petit saw Miss Montevecchi dance as a teen-ager, hired
her for his ballet company and three months later, when she was 18,
named her prima ballerina. She stayed three years before a screen
test took her to Hollywood, where she attended school with
kindergarteners to learn English.
   After Hollywood came ``La Plume de Ma Tante,'' on Broadway and
on tour; a play in Europe, and 10 years of starring in the Folies
Bergere, in New York, where it flopped, Las Vegas and Paris. She
wasn't topless, Miss Montevecchi says. ``Ballet is a very proper
thing and I always kept this. And I was the star of it, in 17
enormous costumes a night, with huge, huge feathers, from Catherine
of Russia to a tango queen.''
   Her mother died last year in Paris. Miss Montevecchi says, ``I
spent five months in Paris; I had to do things. I came back here
with her little dog that I bought her 12 years ago. I do this show
for her. She made me do it, in my heart and mind.''

   As an angry young man in the
1960s, Jackie Ntuane spent more than three years in prison for his
political activism.
   As a prosperous insurance executive today, he says his focus is
on economic independence.
   Ntuane is part of a growing black South African middle class,
which has found opportunities in the business world even while
locked out of national politics.
   This emerging business class, though still small, sees black
economic development as the neglected partner of black political
advancement. Both are viewed as necessary ingredients in
dismantling apartheid, the government's policies of racial
segregation.
   ``Economics and politics are part of the same struggle for
blacks,'' said Ntuane, who manages a 50-member branch office for
the Old Mutual insurance company.
   ``Blacks must succeed in both areas if they are to take control
of their own lives,'' added Ntuane, who was imprisoned for
belonging to the outlawed Pan Africanist Congress.
   The South African economy, by far the largest and most advanced
in Africa, requires an ever increasing number of middle-class
professionals. Blacks have begun to fill that demand, and some
clear signs of black economic progress are emerging:
   _Black households earned an average of 406 rand ($203) a month
in 1986, more than double the figure in 1981 and nearly six times
higher than in 1975, according to Market Research Africa, a private
firm. However, black households still earn less than 20 percent of
the average white family income.
   _The new Lesedi City shopping mall, east of Johannesburg, has
more than 50 black-run businesses and is the largest shopping
complex yet built in a black area.
   _Black taxi drivers, banding together in a nationwide
association, over the past decade have taken away a huge portion of
black commuter ridership from white-owned bus companies.
   _Shareworld, a Disneyland-style amusement park in Soweto, opened
several months ago and is believed the largest enterprise in the
country controlled by black shareholders. A total of 880 black
investors hold 60 percent of the stock.
   ``There are success stories, but they remain the exception,''
said Gabriel Mokgoko, spokesman for the National African Federated
Chamber of Commerce. ``Blacks still are not part of the economic
mainstream.''
   The middle class remains a small fraction of the country's 26
million blacks. Blacks make up about 75 percent of the population,
but only 5 percent of the executives and managers. Black businesses
account for only 1 percent of South Africa's gross national
product, according to Black Enterprise magazine.
   Black businesses face obstacles on several fronts, including
hostility from their own community, where many younger blacks see
the business world as an extension of apartheid and white
domination.
   ``Capitalism has become a discredited system to hundreds of
thousands of (black) South Africans,'' the editors of Black
Enterprise wrote recently. ``To many of our younger students and
graduates, even its name is an anathema (and) earns thinly
disguised ridicule and contempt.''
   Dr. Nthato Motlana, a prominent anti-apartheid activist, said
blacks have become increasingly hostile to business and have failed
to perceive black buying power as a political weapon.
   ``The attitude of young black activists and the unions is most
unfortunate,'' he said recently. ``This message must go out to the
political activists _ blacks need to make money too. Blacks have no
political power, but they should translate their consumer power
into economic power.''
   A long-held theory in the white business establishment is that
apartheid will wither as the economy develops and blacks are drawn
into the middle class.
   Business has proved less resistent to blacks than most other
fields, and the workplace is the most frequent point of multiracial
interaction in a country where neighborhoods and public schools
remain segregated.
   But black leaders say white business has done far less than it
could to assist blacks.
   ``White business climbed on the back of the apartheid political
system years ago and that's where it remains today,'' said Mokgoko.
``Business pays lip service to racial reform, but they have never
exercised their power to help dismantle apartheid or assist blacks
economically.''
   Blacks are the largest consumers of most basic necessities, such
as food and clothing, yet most black businesses are relatively
small operations limited to black townships.
   South Africa has no nationwide black-owned chains, and only one
of the more than 500 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (a group of six bakeries) is run by blacks.
   ``Blacks have no credible representation in any of the major
economic sectors such as mining, agriculture, manufacturing, the
financial institutions, even retailing,'' Reuel Khoza, the black
managing director of Shareworld, wrote recently in Leadership
magazine.
   ``By whatever index we use, black economic activity is so
insignificant as to be almost non-existent,'' Khoza wrote.
   Economic life in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg,
is typical of many black areas. Most shops are mom-and-pop
operations and a substantial informal business sector of street
vendors exists.
   But the township of an estimated 2.5 million people has no
large, central business district or shopping area. Soweto residents
are more likely to shop at white-owned businesses in Johannesburg
than in their neighborhoods.
   By far the largest industry in Soweto is shebeens, illegal bars
_ an estimated 4,000 of them, outnumbering all other businesses
combined.
   Black businessmen say the townships will remain underdeveloped
until bankers become willing to invest in black areas. South Africa
has more than 50 banks, but only one, the African Bank, is
black-run and makes most of its loans to the black community.
   ``Regulation and statute have reduced us to a nation of
small-time merchants running essentially one-man operations,''
Khoza wrote.
   ``Our political spirit has never been crushed, but our assault
on the economic edifice of apartheid has been lamentable,'' he
added. ``In the economic field, we must create a mythology of
competence, of high motivation and high ideals in pursuit of
economic liberation.''

<HEAD>Black Taxi Drivers Take Road to Success in South Africa</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Black Business, b0650</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every workday morning and
evening, the road between Johannesburg and Soweto is lined with
vans taking blacks to and from their jobs.
   Known as ``combis,'' the vans are privately owned taxis that
have contributed to one of the country's leading black business
success stories.
   An estimated 100,000 combis operate nationwide, and almost all
are run by blacks for blacks.
   ``The black taxi industry is a clear example of the black
entrepreneurial flair that exists in South Africa when it is
allowed to flourish,'' said James Chapman, a white who is spokesman
for the Southern African Bus and Taxi Association (SABTA).
   For decades, most urban blacks were at the mercy of inefficient
and inconvenient train and bus systems for their daily trips from
the outlying townships into the cities where they worked.
   When black taxi drivers began appearing in the late 1970s, they
faced a range of restrictions, including limits on the number of
passengers and the requirement that those in each ride be of the
same race.
   But SABTA, a co-operative with 45,000 members, successfully
fought regulatory curbs and has become an increasingly powerful
force in the transport industry since its formation in 1979.
   SABTA has an annual budget of more than 60 million rand ($30
million), runs 16 gas and service stations for members, and
arranges discounts on parts and repairs. The organization also has
persuaded the Toyota and Nissan automotive plants in South Africa
to modify their vans to better accommodate the needs of taxi
drivers.
   Seventy percent of the association's members own only one or two
taxi vans, but most are doing well financially, SABTA says.
   Successful black taxi drivers in urban areas earn as much as
1,000 rand ($500) a month, making them among the highest-earning
black group in the country, said Godfrey Ntlatleng, the
association's vice president. The average monthly income for a
black household in South Africa is 406 rand ($203).
   ``I had to work a lot of 16-hour days, but I always wanted to be
my own boss,'' said Ntlatleng, who started with one taxi and now
oversees a fleet of several combis.
   To join SABTA, members pay an annual 100-rand ($50) fee, and
become part of the local association that sets rates and handles
administrative functions. The current fare for the trip between
Johannesburg and Soweto costs the equivalent of 60 cents and most
vans carry 10 or 15 passengers.
   SABTA's membership and resources have been expanding rapidly,
although the organization failed last year in an attempt to
takeover the nation's largest bus system, PUTCO, for 150 million
rand ($75 million).
   ``It was a temporary setback,'' said Chapman. ``But we've proven
we're a force to be reckoned with.''

<HEAD>Chancellor of Exchequer Credited with Economic Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sweeping capitalist revolution in Britain is
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's.
   But her top Treasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, is the architect of the astounding turnaround in Britain's
economy _ the world's fifth largest.
   Once an economic laughing stock, plagued by strikes, high
interest rates and inflation that coined the phrase ``the British
Disease,'' Britain is in its seventh consecutive year of economic
growth and expanding faster than most of its major trading partners.
   At a projected 3 percent in 1988, Britain's growth will outstrip
the United States' 2.3 percent and West Germany's 1.7 percent, and
stand second only to Japan's 4.2 percent.
   The base lending rate is down from a peak of 16 percent in 1981
to 8.5 percent. The annual inflation rate has been reined in from
18 percent in 1980 to 4 percent last year.
   Now, with a budget unveiled March 15 that will radically reform
the tax structure, Lawson's accomplishments as the main architect
of Mrs. Thatcher's economic policies rank him as one of Britain's
boldest and most respected chancellors.
   ``I think you can certainly say that, certainly in the postwar
period,'' said Ian Harwood, a chief economist at the London
investment firm Warburg Securities.
   ``He compares well with other chancellors,'' said Diane Coyoe, a
British economist with the private forecasting firm DRI Europe.
``He's been a very hands-on chancellor so he has to get a lot of
the credit for it.''
   She added: ``He will certainly be well remembered.''
   Lawson's opponents in the socialistic Labor Party disagree. They
shouted down his budget speech when he announced big tax cuts for
high earners, and one was expelled from the House of Commons for
calling his strategy ``an utter obscenity.''
   Lawson's fifth budget marked his zenith with the nine-year-old
Conservative government's biggest tax reform.
   Reducing the income tax categories from six to two, he slashed
the rate for Britain's highest income earners from 60 percent to
40, and set a basic rate of 25 percent, the lowest since 1938.
   In a testament to the government's tight fiscal spending
policies, 1987-88 produced the first budget surplus in almost 20
years.
   ``Rich man's budget,'' stormed the opposition Laborites, but a
large Conservative majority in the House of Commons assures its
passage.
   Lawson proudly predicted another year of healthy and
non-inflationary economic growth, despite the October stock
markets' crash, and repeated his common boast:
   ``The British economy is stronger than at any time since the
war. We have followed the right policies and stuck to them.''
   The government's critics say that if this is a success story,
the price is too high.
   They say the poor, the unemployed and the sick have been
abandoned by fiscal spending policies short on social conscience.
Mrs. Thatcher argues that only a strong economy can protect the
weak.
   The critics also maintain that unemployment, at a rate of 9.1
percent, is too high. Lawson notes it was above 11 percent 18
months ago.
   Economists also worry about the trade deficit, which is expected
to triple to $7.4 billion in 1988.
   Britain's surplus in oil trade, which was $7.4 billion in 1987,
equal to the expected trade deficit, disguises the real extent of
the country's trade imbalance, the critics say.
   They also contend that falling oil prices played a significant
part in slowing the growth rate from 4.5 percent last year to the
projected 3 percent.
   Lawson's critics also say manufacturing output hasn't fully
recovered from the recession of the early 1980s. It will grow by
5.5 percent in 1988, Lawson said. But the government's most recent
manufacturing output index stood at 113.5 in January, still below
its record 116.8 in June 1974.
   In addition, the labor unrest that Mrs. Thatcher had curbed with
laws limiting union power has picked up with a variety of strikes
in recent months.
   But the government says 3.39 million work days were lost to
strikes last year, up from a 34-year low of 1.92 million in 1986,
but much lower than the 1970s average.
   Lawson, like Mrs. Thatcher, doesn't waver from his agenda, which
has the prime minister's almost unqualified endorsement.
   ``He has held his own opinions and followed them,'' Ms. Coyoe
said.
   His relationship with Mrs. Thatcher is not always harmonious,
however. Just before Budget Day, they disagreed over how much the
government should intervene to stem the increase in the value of
the British pound against other major currencies.
   Mrs. Thatcher stood by her free-market convictions, while Lawson
feared that without intervention, a strong pound would hurt
Britain's exports and corporate profits.
   Short, boyish-faced, chubby, with a shock of black hair and a
tart sense of humor, Lawson is the son of a Jewish Latvian
immigrant who became a London tea merchant.
   Lawson graduated from Oxford University in economics, politics
and philosophy, and was a journalist before being elected to
Parliament in 1974. In 1979 he became a junior Treasury minister in
Mrs. Thatcher's first government.
   He became chancellor in 1983, the first trained economist to
hold the post since 1951, and began as a monetarist, vowing to
extinguish inflation by controlling the growth in Britain's money
supply and government borrowing.
   Today he is a supply-sider who advocates tax cuts and restrained
fiscal spending. Supply-side economists believe increasing the
money available for investment will boost productivity.
   Lawson lives with his second wife and two young children at 11
Downing St., next door to the Thatchers at No. 10.
   Despite being credited with a large part in winning Mrs.
Thatcher her third consecutive term of office, Lawson's political
future is uncertain. Critics say the chancellor is not sociable
enough to garner support to lead the party in the unlikely event
that the unflagging Mrs. Thatcher would step down.
   ``I think he would make a very good prime minister,'' Harwood
said. ``Whether he would have a chance is another question.''
   The British press has speculated that after five years in the
Thatcher Cabinet, Lawson is tired and frustrated, and might take a
lucrative job in the City, London's financial district.
   Lawson says that while his tax reform is complete, it is too
soon to say whether he will be presenting next year's budget.

<HEAD>Memphis to Mark Anniversary of King Assassination</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Blacks and Politics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shabby 64-room motel where Martin
Luther King Jr. died is closed, emptied of its last stubborn
resident, surrounded by a chain-link fence 8 feet high and awaiting
renovation. The slums are as full as ever.
   ``Dr. King was about the business of poor people at the time of
his death, and today there are more poor black people in Memphis
than there were then,'' said Maxine Smith, executive secretary of
the local NAACP.
   King was shot to death at The Lorraine Motel on April 4, 1968,
and civil rights leaders say the 20th anniversary of his
assassination should remind the nation that the battles he fought
remain unwon.
   ``The attention of the country should be on Memphis,'' said
James E. Smith, director of Local 1733 of the American Federation
of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   King was in Memphis to support striking city garbage men when he
was slain. On April 3, the union will sponsor a memorial service at
the Mason Temple, where he delivered one of his most famous
speeches.
   ``I've been to the mountain top,'' King told his followers the
night before his death. ``I may not get there with you, but I want
you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised
land.''
   A ``poor-people's pilgrimage'' through Mississippi, Alabama and
Georgia will begin April 4 in Memphis with a wreath-laying ceremony
at The Lorraine.
   A program of speeches and music to be staged at a downtown
theater April 4 will be the first event the city has ever sponsored
in King's honor.
   ``I think anybody who is familiar with Memphis politics, Memphis
society, would have thought you were crazy if you said five or 10
years ago that Memphis was going to sponsor an official city
tribute to Dr. King,'' said the Rev. Kenneth Whalum Jr., chairman
of a commission appointed by Mayor Richard Hackett to coordinate
the city program.
   ``It speaks volumes about the progress we have made,'' Whalum
said.
   The city and county governments have put up $2.2 million each to
match $4.4 million from the state for a civil rights museum at The
Lorraine, and museum supporters say it indicates Memphis is less
worried about being identified as the city where King was killed.
   ``There had to be time for people to realize that the impact of
the movement and Dr. King was not a passing moment,'' said D'Army
Bailey, a prime mover behind the project. ``The Lorraine didn't
become less important over the years. It became more important.''
   The city must recognize it has a special place in history
because King was killed here, he said.
   ``It is a remarkable challenge that we have to continually
answer to show we are making some progress toward racial and
economic justice,'' Bailey said. ``There is essentially a white
Memphis and a black Memphis, but I don't see that most other
American cities are any different. I think we are trying here.''
   Despite progress, however, other community leaders say racial
and economic divisions in Memphis are still sharp.
   ``We have a long way to go in healing the wounds of King's
assassination and in addressing racial polarization,'' said Willie
Herenton, superintendent of Memphis schools. He said conditions for
the hard-core poor had changed little in two decades.
   ``There's a lot of hopelessness and despair,'' he said.
   Jacqueline Smith, 37, who was forcibly evicted from The Lorraine
on March 2 after living there nine years, remains camped out on the
sidewalk in protest. The former Lorraine chambermaid and waitress
thinks the motel should be converted to a shelter for the homeless.
   ``I'm trying to help the people who live in this area,'' she
said as she was being evicted. ``We're being forced out'' of the
neighborhood.
   The U.S. Census Bureau says Memphis' population of 558,000 in
1968 was about 40 percent black. In 1987 the population was
estimated at 652,000 and 50 percent black.
   In 1970, the median income for blacks in Memphis was about half
that of whites, and a 1987 report on local poverty by the Shelby
County mayor's office says that margin has not lessened.
   Almost half of the black families in Memphis live in poverty,
the report says, and 79 percent of the children in city schools
live near or below the poverty level. Seventy-eight percent of the
107,000 students in the schools are black.
   ``If you look at the percentage of property ownership and things
like that, where the money is, blacks are still mainly on the
outside,'' said Charles Crawford, a history professor at Memphis
State University.
   But King's assassination in this city permanently changed the
city's racial attitudes.
   ``There was a feeling of real shock that it had happened and,
maybe like (President John) Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, that
it had happened here,'' Crawford said. ``It brought about a much
more sudden acceptance of the necessity of integration.''
   After King's death, blacks greatly increased their involvement
in city politics, Crawford said, and white politicians began taking
them more seriously.
   In 1967, the city's registered voters broke down to 152,562
whites and 78,655 blacks. Now, 181,539 whites, 175,395 blacks and
14,180 others are registered.
   Three of the 13 city council members are black, the same as 20
years ago, and four members of the 11-member Shelby County
commission are black.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Like Thomas Chippendale, 18th century
cabinetmaker and woodworking artist before him, Wendell Castle is
both a sculptor who makes furniture and a furniture craftsman who
makes sculpture. Experts say he's currently acknowledged to be the
only major artist working in furniture.

<TEXT>
   Wendell Castle, the kingpin of art
furniture in the United States, takes delight in creating pieces
that sometimes defy definition.
   His work, whether it's a chair with a wooden suit coat draped
over it or a cabinet that appears destined to topple over, always
seems to have a ``fooled you again'' quality.
   The 55-year-old artist has found an interesting niche between
the art and furniture worlds.
   For example, a ladder-like, impractical sculpture contains a
tiny, working cabinet. A beautifully crafted table has an open book
and eyeglasses carved out of wood sitting atop the delicate inlay.
   He can turn wood into wrinkled sheets and cabinets into
spectacular sculpture.
   Castle, trying to explain his career recently to an acquaintance
who is an attorney, told him, ``I make art furniture.''
   ``In this case, that statement didn't help matters,'' Castle
recalls. ``So I said, `It's sort of halfway between being furniture
and sculpture.'
   ``That is exactly what I do, but whether that description means
anything to a lawyer, I don't know.''
   Castle is a sculptor who makes furniture, a furniture craftsman
who makes sculpture.
   His creations sell for anywhere from $8,000 to $130,000. They
have been shown in art galleries and on the pages of woodworking
magazines.
   His two most important commissions recently have been designing
the 500,000th Steinway piano and a 19-foot tall clock sculpture in
downtown Toronto.
   Castle, a slender, bearded man who wears half-glasses when he
delicately trims blocks of wood on a band saw, doesn't mind being a
man without a label. In fact, he prefers it.
   ``I sort of bounce back and forth,'' he says. ``Whenever I get
real close to one or stay close to one for very long, it bothers
me. Staying in the middle is more difficult, but there's where I
really want to be.''
   In the art world, Castle is well known as the only major artist
working in furniture, a field that has a rich history dating back
to the Renaissance, says art historian Penelope Hunter-Stiebel.
   Probably the ``most recognizable artist of this type'' is Thomas
Chippendale, the 18th century English cabinetmaker, says
Hunter-Steibel, a former curator at Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York, who acquired a Castle loveseat for the museum. ``There's
been lots of cabinetmakers, but only a few artists. Wendell Castle
is one of the few.''
   In the furniture world, Castle's name is a ``household word''
among woodworkers and furniture designers, says Paul Bertorelli, a
senior editor at Taunton Press, publisher of ``Fine Woodworking''
magazine.
   Castle graduated from the University of Kansas with an
undergraduate degree in industrial design and a master's degree in
sculpture.
   He painted abstract expressionist art before coming to the
Rochester Institute of Technology in 1962 and starting his
innovative career that took him to Brockport State College in 1970
and then to his own furniture design school in 1980.
   During that time he's created some of the world's
strangest-looking chairs, desks, clocks and book shelves. He's
tackling a musical instrument for the first time.
   ``I've never even made a guitar. I've been interested in
building a piano for maybe 10 years,'' he says. Castle was
approached by the Smithsonian Institution about building a piano in
the 1970s, but the project fell through.
   Castle was given the prestigious commission of designing the
500,000th Steinway Model D grand piano last summer and submitted 10
designs to Steinway & Sons.
   All of the designs were somewhat conservative, at least by
Castle's standards.
   ``There wouldn't be any point in reinventing the piano,'' he
says. ``And since the Steinway Model D is the standard concert
instrument in the world I didn't think it would be smart to deviate
from it too much.''
   The 100,000th Steinway is in the Smithsonian and the 200,000th,
presented to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938, is in the
East Room of the White House.
   Castle's design uses dark ebony and striped Indian ebony wood to
create an elegant, angular shape with large boxy legs.
   The names of the more than 1,000 Steinway artists, such as
Vladimir Horowitz and Van Cliburn, who chose to play Steinways
professionally, will be etched into the dark ebony.
   In his workshop, Castle gently brushes the sawdust from the
dark, unfinished wood as he explains how moving the rear leg on his
design dramatically changed the piano's sound.
   The rear leg, he says, is always found on the edge of the piano
so it won't affect the vibrations that produce the instrument's
sounds.
   ``But I don't like the look of that, so we're going to do a
little bit of extra work so we can put the leg here,'' Castle said
pointing to an area in the middle of the piano.
   The change will require the construction of a bridge-like device
that will keep the leg from actually touching the underside of the
center of the piano.
   The piano will be unveiled June 2 at a gala celebration in
Carnegie Hall in New York and will then begin a tour of the world's
great concert halls, says Steinway spokesman Leo Spellman.
   A day earlier, Castle's huge clock, made out of bronze and
stainless steel, will be unveiled at the corner of Bloor and Yonge
streets, one of downtown Toronto's busiest intersections.
   Both works will mark a milestone of sorts for Castle.
   ``I've wanted to make a stronger statement publicly. I've wanted
to make big pieces,'' Castle says. ``That's one of the problems
with furniture. A sculptor can make a monument _ an important
public piece. Well, what's an important piece of furniture. I don't
know what that is.''

outstanding shares for $80 a share. Bridgestone was spurred to make
the $2.6 billion offer Thursday because of an unsolicited offer
from Italian tiremaker Pirelli SpA.

   Less than a week before insider trader Ivan F.
Boesky was to start serving a federal prison term, officials
declined to discuss his whereabouts and there were indications he
might already be in custody.
   The mystery Friday of the ex-financier's location came against a
background of death threats made against him, raising the
possibility that he might have sought federal protection prior to
his scheduled surrender date of March 24.
   Boesky, the central figure in Wall Street's biggest insider

   A federal judge has set a January court date in
Polaroid Corp.'s $5.7 billion patent infringement claim against
Eastman Kodak Co.
   Judge Rya Zobel on Friday set a Jan. 9, 1989, trial date in the
12-year-old case and ordered pre-trial evidence be presented to the
court on July 27.
   In 1985, Zobel ruled that Kodak had infringed on seven of about
150 Polaroid patents on instant cameras and film.
   Polaroid claims $3.2 billion in lost camera and film sales and
seeks an additional $2.5 billion for lost opportunities to develop

<HEAD>Beazer-Shearson Sweetens Offer For Koppers To $56 A Share From $45</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koppers Co.'s board of directors will consider
a sweetened buyout offer totaling about $1.5 billion from a group
led by British investor Brian Beazer and the firm Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., the company says.
   The new offer disclosed Sunday of $56 for each of Koppers'
roughly 27.2 million common shares outstanding tops the group's
initial $45 a share offer that Koppers rejected as inadequate last
week.
   Koppers stock rose 12{ cents to $53.75 a share Friday in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Charles R. Pullin, Koppers chairman, said that in addition to
considering the sweetened offer the construction materials and
chemical company would continue exploring ways to enhance
shareholder values.
   In rejecting the investor group's initial offer, Koppers' board
authorized management to examine defensive alterantives that might
include a recapitalization plan under which shareholders would
receive a substantial dividend payment while retaining equity in
the company.
   Pullin also reiterated a disclosure made last week in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that Koppers was engaged
in discussions with third parties regarding the possible sale of
the company's construction materials and services businesses.

   The dollar fell in light trading in Europe today
in the absence of any market-moving news. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they expected the trading session
to remain lackluster throughout much of the European day because of
a lack of input from Tokyo, where markets are closed for a holiday.
   Traders said that in absence of news, some dealers were taking
minor short-dollar positions _ or agreeing to sell dollars they
don't yet own _ in expectations of a further slide in the dollar in
the short term.
   ``We see the dollar coming down a bit, especially since it
failed to take out 1.70 (West German marks) after the (U.S.) trade
figures came out,'' said a senior dealer at a major U.S. bank in
Frankfurt.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday the U.S. merchandise
trade deficit widened to $12.4 billion in January from $12.2
billion in December. The markets had been expecting a deficit of
$12.8 billion.
   The dollar was quoted at 127.35 yen in London, compared with
128.35 yen in Tokyo on Friday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.6898 West German marks, down from 1.6950; 1.3970
Swiss francs, down from 1.4010; 5.7440 French francs, down from
5.7480; 1.8983 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9010; 1,250.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,252.50; and 1.2470 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2495.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8300, compared
with $1.8235 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $445.80 dollars a troy
ounce, compared with late Friday's $443.25. At mid-morning today,
the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$446.50.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $446.35, up from $445 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $448.26 bid, up 36 cents
from Saturday.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.37 a troy

   Alexander M. Lewyt, an inventor who
developed a vacuum cleaner designed to operate without interfering
with TV or radio reception, has died at age 79.
   Lewyt died on Friday.
   Born in New York, Lewyt was the son of an Austrian immigrant who
ran a gadget shop.
   He held patents on scores of inventions.
   When he learned of undertakers' difficulty in fastening neckties
on corpses, the teen-age Lewyt devised a new kind of bow tie that
clipped on. He sold 50,000 of them. It was unclear whether he ever
patented the concept.
   He was best known for the compact Lewyt vacuum cleaner, which
had no dust bag and was designed not to cause interference.
   In the first eight years after his vacuum cleaner was introduced
after World War II, Lewyt Corp. sold 2 million of them. During the
war, Lewyt Corp. did a multi-million dollar business making such
things as radar antennas and popcorn poppers.
   Lewyt sold his interest in the company to the Budd Corp. in the
1950s.

<HEAD>West Germany to Sell its Stake in Volkswagen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany said Monday it will sell
its remaining shares in Volkswagen AG, returning to its
twice-delayed plans to privatize the government's stake in the
giant car company.
   The government will sell its 16 percent Volkswagen stake at 238
marks, or $140, a share beginning Thursday, according to a
statement by the Finance Ministry. The price set by the Finance
Ministry is a slight discount from Volkswagen's current cost of 240
marks a share.
   The government owns 4.8 million shares in the company, and
expects to make some 1.14 billion marks on the deal, the ministry
said.
   The shares will be sold through a consortium of 75 West German
and foreign banks led by Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank
and others.
   West Germany announced plans to sell its Volkswagen stake more
than a year ago, but the move has been delayed twice in recent
months.
   The sale was delayed last summer after Volkswagen was hit by a
scandal in the company's foreign exchange division that cost
millions of marks.
   Plans to reschedule the sale for late in the year were shelved
shortly after the Oct. 19 stock market crash that sent share prices
plummeting around the world.
   Analysts say the government is going ahead with the transaction
now because it is faced with a wider-than-expected federal budget
deficit in 1988.

<HEAD>Court Will Hear Appeal on Bankruptcy Issue in Michigan Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed today to hear a
Reagan administration appeal aimed at allowing some creditors to
collect more money from debtors who declare bankruptcy.
   The court said it will review a decision denying the
government's claim for some interest payments on taxes owed by a
bankrupt company.
   The case stems from a reorganization petition filed by Ron Pair
Enterprises before a bankruptcy judge in Detroit in 1984.
   The government said the company owed it $53,278 in taxes,
penalties and interest accrued prior to the filing of the
bankruptcy petition.
   The company agreed to pay the amount, but refused to pay
additional interest accrued after the bankruptcy filing.
   The government said the company should pay the post-filing
interest because the collateral _ tax liens on company property _
securing the debt owed the government exceeded the amount of the
original debt.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the
government in September. The appeals court said the bankruptcy
code, revised by Congress in 1978, does not clearly provide for
such payments. They previously had been disallowed by courts.
   Justice Department lawyers said the appeals court ruling could
prove costly to the government.
   They said the Internal Revenue Service filed secured claims in
bankruptcy proceedings totaling more than $730 million from 1982
through 1986, including $186 million in 1986 alone.
   The government lawyers said state and local governments and
private creditors also are affected by the appeals court ruling.
   The case is U.S. vs. Ron Pair, 87-1043.

<HEAD>GE Boosts Bid For Roper; Files Suit Against Whirlpool</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: new throughout to UPDATE with GE filing suit, details; no
pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. today boosted its bid for
Roper Corp. to $507 million and filed lawsuits seeking to block
Roper from merging with Whirlpool Corp.
   GE, which sweetened its bid by $9 a share, announced the new
$54-a-share tender offer today.
   The offer betters Whirlpool's second tender bid for Roper, made
last week, which amounts to $50 a share, or about $470 million.
GE's latest bid expires April 1, unless extended.
   Whirlpool's initial $37.50-a-share offer prompted the bidding
war for Augusta, Ga.-based Roper. On March 6, GE entered the fray
by offering to pay $45 a share for Roper's 9.4 million outstanding
shares.
   After jumping $5.75 a share on Friday, Roper stock had risen
another $2.625 a share on the New York Stock Exchange by midday.
   GE's lawsuit, filed in Delaware State Court, is the second wave
of legal action in the battle for the Augusta, Ga.-based appliance
and lawn equipment maker.
   On Friday, Whirlpool filed suit charging that GE tried to
``sabotage the definitive merger agreement Whirlpool reached with
Roper's board of directors last month.
   Moving aggressively, GE today alleged that the Roper board made
no effort to ``test the price'' before agreeing to merge with
Whirlpool on Feb. 29. GE charged that Roper concealed GE's interest
in the company when it advised shareholders to tender to Whirlpool.
   GE contends that it had expressed ``prior interest in acquiring
Roper and had asked to be informed if Roper became available for
acquisition.''
   The suit was filed against the Roper board and names Whirlpool
as a defendant.
   In a separate lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware,
GE charged that both Whirlpool and Roper failed to adequately
disclose terms of their merger agreement under Securities and
Exchange Commission laws.
   GE said in a statement earlier that it would ``vigorously defend
itself'' against Whirlpool's charges that GE tried to ``sabotage''
the Whirlpool-Roper merger agreement. GE seeks to transfer that
suit from U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids, Mich., to federal
court in Delaware.
   In its lawsuit, Whirlpool charged that GE intentionally sought
to block Whirlpool's merger with Roper.
   Whirlpool alleged that the head of GE's appliance business
personally tried to persuade Roper to break its contract with
Whirlpool. The suit said GE ``intentionally, maliciously and
unjustifiedly engaged in a continuing course of conduct to
sabotage'' the deal.
   GE said in a statement today the suit ``grossly misstated the
facts and was totally without legal merit.'' GE noted that its
offer was made directly to shareholders who ``are not bound by the
acquisition agreement between Whirlpool and the Roper board.''
   Whirlpool said its suit is ``similar in theory'' to Pennzoil
Co.'s billion-dollar legal battle with Texaco Inc. over Texaco's
acquisition of Getty Oil Co. Texaco agreed to settle the suit for
$3 billion after Pennzoil won a $10.3 billion judgment against the
oil giant on charges that Texaco prompted Getty to back out of an
agreement with Pennzoil.
   Roper has been supportive of Whirlpool's efforts. Last week
Roper Chief Executive Officer Robert Cook said the company ``has a
strong desire to see this combination successfully completed.''
   Analysts say a Roper-Whirlpool merger will move Whirlpool ahead
of GE as the nation's leading appliance maker. Whirlpool has said
it would expand Roper from a maker of cooking ranges into a
producer and marketer of a full line of appliances.
   Roper reported net income of $24 million on sales of $703
million in fiscal 1987.

<HEAD>High Court Lets Ruling Stand on Investors Suing Brokers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that makes it easier for investors to sue their brokers over the
collapse in 1984 of a $3 billion oil and natural gas investment
fund.
   The court, without comment, rejected appeals by three brokerage
firms seeking to force investors who lost money in the fund to sue
individually rather than as a group.
   The case stems from the collapse of the Petro-Lewis fund, in
which some 180,000 people purchased securities and limited
partnerships from 1970 to 1984. The average initial investment by a
limited partner was $8,600.
   Petro-Lewis' financial problems began when a supply glut caused
oil and gas prices to plummet in the early 1980s.
   The fund revealed in February 1984 that its condition was
critical, cutting partnership distribution by as much as 50 percent
and selling up to one-third of its reserves.
   That prompted numerous lawsuits against Petro-Lewis, and also
against brokers who helped market the fund.
   Some investors settled with Petro-Lewis, which set up a $23.5
million fund to handle the claims. But that agreement did not
preclude investors from suing their brokers.
   The investors said the brokerage houses and individual brokers
``knowingly or recklessly participated with Petro-Lewis in
disseminating misleading information'' about the financial
condition of the funds.
   At issue in the case acted on today is whether the investors can
maintain ``class action'' suits that permit them to apportion the
costs of fighting the case and divide up any court award.
   Robinson-Humphrey Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and
Painewebber Inc. appealed a ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta favoring the investors.
   The appeals court said investors who claimed they were defrauded
are arguing a common theory.
   They allege ``that the Petro-Lewis shares, which were not traded
on the open market, could not have been marketed but for the
defendants' fraud,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court rejected the brokers' argument that because
investors relied on information given them orally by different
brokers their claims should be tried separately.
   ``The complaints alleged that the defendant brokerage firms and
individual officers engaged in a common course of conduct to
misrepresent ... the financial condition of Petro-Lewis,'' the
appeals court said. ``These claims involve common issues that
clearly overwhelm the individual issues that may be present.''
   It would be repetitive, wasteful and an unnecessary burden on
the courts to require separate trials, the appeals court added.
   The cases are Robinson Humphrey vs. Sanders, 87-835, and
Painewebber vs. Parker, 87-836.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to reports
of real and rumored grain purchases by the Soviet Union.
   On Friday, the Agriculture Department targeted the Soviet Union
for 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat under the Export
Enhancement Program.
   The USDA also announced late Friday that the Soviets had bought
500,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Rumors early today that the Soviet Union had purchased some
South American soybean meal helped boost soybean futures, said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``That's not as friendly as if they'd bought U.S. meal but if
the rumors are correct, it shows that Russia is in the market for
meal again,'' Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.01 a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 1} cents higher with March at $1.99 a bushel; oats were \ cent
lower to 1} cents higher with March at $1.95} a bushel; soybeans
were 5{ cents to 7\ cents higher with March at $6.27 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the

   Live cattle were .27 cent lower to .37 cent higher with April at
73.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .27 cent lower
with March at 81.85 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent lower to .10

   Claire Molloy sits in her
wheelchair mulling the possible purchase of a knit jogging suit
that just happens to be in lilac, currently her favorite color.
   ``What I really need are lilac sneakers,'' said the 65-year-old
resident of the Bartley Manor nursing home before tossing the
jogging suit back on the rack.
   She and other residents were choosing their spring wardrobes
over coffee and doughnuts in the nursing home's sunny recreation
room.
   The at-home shopping service is made available by Silverthreads
Inc., an Audubon, N.J.-based company that specializes in
health-care apparel.
   Silverthreads actually is a traveling store that sets up shop in
nursing homes in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Virginia and West Virginia. Its mail-order catalog serves other
customers, many of whom are cared for at home by their families.
   Silverthreads President Martin Misiaszek, who started the firm
10 years ago, said the company tries to provide its elderly
customers with everyday apparel such as nightgowns and dresses as
well as specialized apparel such as washable shoes for patients who
may be incontinent.
   ``What we try to do is bring a clothing store to a nursing
home,'' said Misiaszek, who has a degree in health-care management.
   Silverthreads treats its customers, most of whom are over 85
years old, with respect and understanding, he said.
   ``We all like to see what we're going to purchase, whether it
has two pockets or a belt. These people are no different,'' he said.
   While on the road, Silverthreads packs its inventory, racks,
bins and mirrors in a 20-foot truck. It's driven by Misiaszek's
younger brother, Bob, the company's vice president.
   Silverthreads' most popular lines are shirts, dresses and night
clothes that close in the back, and mens' pants with snaps on the
sides, he said.
   ``These are for people who can't dress themselves so nurses can
dress them,'' Bob Misiaszek said. ``It's a big help for nurses
aides.''
   Other speciality items include terry-cloth bibs with Velcro
snaps, flannel and corduroy lap wraps that tie around a wheelchair
patient's waist and cushy non-skid slippers for patients with foot
disorders.
   ``We try to have clothes that allow people to retain their
self-esteem,'' Bob Misiaszek said while straightening a bin filled
with dainty women's underwear and frilly nightgowns.
   Prices are range from $24 for cotton dresses with front zippers
to $16 for a two-piece jumpsuit.
   ``The prices are reasonable. We've been looking around and the
prices here are better than a department store,'' said Jerry
Schultz of Pine Beach, N.J.
   He and his wife, Jean, were shopping for new clothes for his
91-year-old mother, Amelia Schultz.
   ``This is ideal,'' he said. ``We can't take mother out to the
store and she should like what she's wearing.''
   Silverthreads also will put on fashion shows at the request of
nursing homes. The shows are a boost for patients and staff alike,
said Betty Maxwell, the recreation director at Bartley Manor.
   ``It's great. They can try them on right afterwards,'' she said
as some residents and their families clustered around racks of
dresses, slacks and other items.
   The Misiaszeks say annual sales are a family secret. They also
say Silverthreads provides more than a shopping service.
   ``It's really rewarding to see I'm making a difference. It
really has a lot of painful moments,'' Martin Misiaszek said. ``But
I love it. I wouldn't do anything else except win the lottery.''
   Mrs. Molloy never found her lilac sneakers, although there were
plenty in other colors.
   ``Nooooo,'' she said. ``Gotta be lilac.''
   She settled for a pair of pale yellow slacks, then decided to
browse a bit longer because ``I might find something else that
strikes my fancy. They have things here that we can really use.''

<HEAD>China Tells Its Unions to Work Harder for Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unionists at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant
recently decided the factory manager had not been duly rewarded for
his hard work, and voted to increase his annual bonus.
   That was one example, boasted Zheng Lanjun, head of the
7,200-member union, of how unions in socialist China strive to
serve, rather than confront, the system.
   But that cozy relationship, under the firm guidance of the
Communist Party, is changing.
   China's bold economic reforms, including giving factory bosses
the authority to hire and fire workers, have forced unions to
redefine their role, and even infused them with a touch of
militancy.
   With party approval, unions are becoming more democratic, less
subservient to the party and more vocal on such issues as wages and
worker safety.
   ``The reforms have brought prosperity to the country and
benefits to workers,'' Shen Zuying, spokesman for the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions, said in an interview. ``But they have
also created new tasks for the unions as protectors of workers'
interests.''
   Shen related how a union in Wuhan, central China, recently
fought back when the manager fired six workers for breaking factory
rules. It managed to get five reinstated, he said.
   In the northeast city of Tianjin, workers at a factory exercised
their new-found power to oversee company operations by casting a
no-confidence vote against the factory manager. He was reassigned
to the plant's library.
   The government has sanctioned a more assertive union movement to
balance the growing power of factory managers under reforms that
make industry more competitive and end lifetime employment
guarantees.
   Beijing is giving factory heads greater freedom and
responsibility over profits and losses, and promoting job contracts
that tie wages to performance. Few workers ever get fired, but for
the first time, employees face discipline and possible dismissal
for loafing on the job.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang has called on unions to wake
up to the new realities, and play a greater ``supervisory role''
over the activities of their now powerful bosses.
   ``For a long time, trade unions were only involved in trifles,
distributing film tickets or relief aid to needy workers,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency said. ``They played a small role in
political issues.''
   That wasn't all the unions' fault. The All-China Federation of
Trade Unions, made up of 15 union groupings with a membership of 90
million, or 90 percent of Chinese factory workers, dates back to
1926. But since the Communists came to power in 1949 and proclaimed
the dictatorship of the proletariat, the unions have been relegated
to carrying out the party line on the factory floor.
   In the 1950s, unions were accused of ``syndicalism,'' or trying
to dominate the government, and unions were disbanded during the
ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   The right of workers to strike was deleted from the 1982
constitution.
   ``The leaders didn't think it was necessary,'' said the ACFTU's
Shen. ``We are socialists, and the country's interests and those of
workers are the same.''
   He added, however, that strikes are not illegal, and that if a
strike is found to be justified, ``we should support it.'' Such
cases, he said, have been very rare.
   Instead, unions are focusing on gaining a greater say in factory
decisions.
   Workers in many plants nominate and elect their union
representatives, called workers' congresses. The congresses, or
their leaders, must in turn be consulted by the factory manager
before major decisions are made, particularly on personnel matters.
   Party officials are supposed to let the unions run their own
day-to-day affairs, although they still hold seats on union
committees and are expected to guide the ideological thinking of
workers.
   ``In the past, the party interfered too much in our
activities,'' Shen said.
   The union at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, besides
organizing badminton tournaments and calligraphy classes, is
increasingly called on to mediate worker disputes, Zheng said.
   He related how the union was the arbiter when a woman caught
stealing was fired, and when a man who lost both legs in an
accident was unhappy with management's compensation of a new
apartment, television and refrigerator. In both cases, the union
came down on the side of management.
   But the union also has demanded that the factory do something
about its unsanitary dining hall, and is pushing for the factory to
provide physical examinations more frequently than the current once
every four years.
   ``The trade union should support the director in exercising his
rights, and at the same time protect the rights of workers,'' Zheng
said.
   The ACFTU's monopoly over organized labor is not likely to
change. In 1981, some young people tried to establish independent
unions modeled after Poland's Solidarity, but they were quickly
suppressed.
   Although union membership is technically voluntary, almost
everybody joins. Zheng said the 100 non-union workers in the
7,300-worker plant are new employees who haven't put their
applications in yet.
   But the ACFTU's Shen noted that the reforms also have created 20
million private businessmen and 80 million workers in small rural
factories who are largely unorganized. These groups, he said, may
be the union movement's next big challenge.

<HEAD>Bell Resources Ends Bid for Holmes a Court's Bell Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERTH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell Resources Ltd. on Monday withdrew its takeover
offer for Bell Group Ltd. following a bid for Bell Resources by two
investors.
   The investors, Sir Ronald Brierley's Industrial Equity Ltd. and
Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd., are jointly
offering 900 million Australian dollars, the equivalent of $665
million, for Bell Resources.
   Their offer, made last Thursday, was conditioned on Bell
Resources ending its offer for Bell Group. The companies are the
main listed concerns operated by Australian financier Robert Holmes
a Court.
   Bell Resources said the takeover offer was ``a material change
in circumstances'' that should be considered by the company and its
shareholders although Bell Resources considered the price
inadequate.
   Brierley and Packer were offering 1.50 Australian dollars a
share for Bell Resources. The company's stock closed at 1.57
Australian dollars in trading in Sydney Monday, indicating the
market expects the bid to be raised.
   On Feb. 29, Bell Resources offered one of its own shares plus 1
Australian dollar cash for each Bell Group share.
   The bid was seen by many analysts as a move to simplify Holmes a
Court's corporate structure after the October stock market crash,
to put togther Bell Resource's cash and investments with Bell
Group's industrial operations, and therefore to reduce Bell Group's
heavy borrowings.
   The move would give Holmes a Court cash. He owns 45 percent of
Bell Group, which in owns about 40 percent of Bell Resources.
   The takeover bid was criticized as too generous for Bell Group
shares and so to the disadvantage of Bell Resources shareholders.

<HEAD>Business Investment To Rise 8.8 Percent, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment in plant and equipment by U.S.
business is likely to increase about 8.8 percent this year but only
0.5 percent in 1989, according to a survey released Monday.
   Manufacturers are likely to lead the way this year with a 12.5
percent increase in investment, but trail in 1989 with a 2.9
percent decrease, Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass., said.
   The larger non-manufacturing sector is expected to be more
stable, with a 6.6 percent increase this year and a 2.7 percent
increase in 1989, the survey said, based on answers from 457
companies.
   Companies were more optimistic about 1988 than in a previous
survey conducted just before the October stock market crash, when
they predicted overall investment in plant and equipment would rise
6.2 percent, according to Data Resources, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.
   Many economists say the stock market crash cooled off the
economy at a time when it was in danger of overheating and falling
into recession. Some are now pushing back the date of an expected
recession to 1989.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court in some business-related cases:
   
   DALKON SHIELD
   
   The court refused to let the Dalkon Shield's maker set up a $15
million emergency fund to help women who say the contraceptive
device left them infertile.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that blocks
creation of the fund pending the outcome of bankruptcy proceedings
for A.H. Robins, which manufactures the device.
   In a related case, the court refused to review a ruling that at
least temporarily barred some Dalkon Shield users from suing Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., which insures A.H. Robins for liability
claims.
   The cases are Mabey vs. Official Committee of Equity Security
Holders, 87-1267, and Oberg vs. Aetna, 87-1208.
   
   EQUAL TIME
   
   The court rejected a constitutional attack on a federal law
requiring broadcasters to give equal time to opposing candidates
for public office.
   The justices, without comment, turned down the appeal of a
Sacramento, Calif., television reporter kept off the air while he
ran for a non-salaried town council seat.
   The case is Branch vs. FCC, 87-628.
   
   AGE BIAS
   
   The court, agreeing to decide an important issue for all
lawsuits alleging age bias in employment, said it will study the
case of a laid-off Pennsylvania man.
   The justices agreed to decide whether Eugene F. Brieck's lawsuit
against his former employer, Harbison-Walker Refractories, should
proceed to a jury trial.
   The case is Harbison-Walker vs. Brieck, 87-271.
   
   GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
   
   The court agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law
designed to promote competitive bidding on government contracts,
setting the stage for a new ruling on the boundaries between
congressional and presidential powers.
   The court said it will hear Reagan administration arguments
challenging the comptroller general's role in administering the
1984 Competition in Contracting Act.
   The case is Army Corps of Engineers vs. Ameron, 87-163.
   
   SALES TAX
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may impose sales taxes
on most books, newspapers and magazines while exempting religious
publications.
   The justices said they will review a Texas court ruling that
said such a tax neither violates equal-protection rights nor
breeches the constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   The case is Texas Monthly vs. Bullock, 87-1245.
   
   CABLE RATES
   
   The court refused to let states and local governments regulate
the prices most of the nation's cable television operators charge
for basic service.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the
deregulation effected in 1986 by Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission left subscribers vulnerable to illegal
monopoly pricing.
   
   The case is Connecticut vs. FCC, 87-671.
   
   The court agreed to examine the power of labor unions to fire
elected officials for disagreeing with union policies.
   The court said it will consider killing a lawsuit by a Los
Angeles area union business representative who said he was fired
illegally by the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association.
   The case is Sheet Metal Workers vs. Lynn, 86-1940.
   
   SUPERFUND
   
   The court agreed to consider shielding states from having to
help pay for cleaning up hazardous waste sites when the federal
government sues businesses under the so-called Superfund law.
   The court said it will hear arguments by Pennsylvania officials
that exposing states to such liability could saddle them with $100
billion in clean-up costs.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Union Gas, 87-1241.
   
   RICO
   
   The court agreed to consider making it easier for people to use
a federal anti-racketeering law to sue businesses.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by phone customers in
Minnesota who have accused Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. of
trying to bribe state public utility officials.
   The phone subscribers sued the company under a law known as the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
   The case is H.J. Inc. vs. Northwestern Bell, 87-1252.

<HEAD>Kelso Prepared To Raise Bid For American Standard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kelso & Co. expects to decide by the end of this
month whether to sweeten its $2.5 billion tender offer for American
Standard Inc. to fend off rival bidder Black & Decker Corp.,
according to a report published Monday.
   American Standard, a New York-based plumbing and air
conditioning company, on Thursday accepted Kelso's $78-a-share
offer. But the following day, Black & Decker raised its bid for
American Standard to $77 a share from $73.
   The Kelso offer began Monday and was scheduled to expire at
12:01 a.m. EST April 1. Black & Decker extended its offer to expire
on the same day.
   Despite the fact that Kelso's bid is about $30 million higher,
Black & Decker has maintained that its proposal is better ``in
light of the timing and probability of payment.''
   Black & Decker, a Towson, Md.-based tool and appliance maker, is
hoping to benefit from nervous arbitrageurs who hold a majority of
American Standard's stock and worry that Kelso might not be able to
come up with the financing to complete the transaction.
   Tendering their shares to Black & Decker still would ensure a
premium price for American Standard's stock, which by late
afternoon Monday traded at $76.50 a share, up 87.5 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Kelso, however, said it was willing to raise its bid to win over
shareholders, according to Monday's editions of the Wall Street
Journal.
   ``We didn't come this far to be deterred by this kind of
response,'' Joseph Schuchert, Kelso's managing partner, told the
newspaper. ``We'll tender at $78 and see what they do. If it's
necessary to bump our tender offer, that's what we'll do.''
   He said Kelso was unlikely to act until March 31.
   Kelso officials did not return numerous telephone calls from The
Associated Press on Monday.
   Kelso specializes in leveraged buyouts involving employee stock
ownership plans, or ESOPs, a concept it pioneered about 30 years
ago.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely through
borrowed money repaid from the target company's profits or sale of
assets. ESOPs also are financed mostly with borrowed funds, but
equity is divided among all of the company's workers, not just a
few investors.
   Kelso said it planned to finance the American Standard
acquisition through a $250 million investment and several bank
loans.

   Stocks fell today in a spate of selling that
reflected another dose of post-crash anxiety and falling prices in
the bond market, a warning signal of higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which hit the highest
level since the Oct. 19 collapse twice last week and flirted with
the 2,100-point barrier, fell 21.89 points to 2,065.48 by 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   ``There are very nervous people out there,'' said Hank
Striefler, vice president on the trading floor at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. ``Everybody is concerned. By reaching 2,100, that's
sort of a top for the Dow at the moment.''
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues fell 1.39 to 151.26. On the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.61 to 297.50.
   Losing issues outnumbered gainers by more than 2-to-1 on the
NYSE, with 1,106 down, 427 up and 419 unchanged. Volume totaled
107.07 million shares with an hour left, a considerably slower pace
than in the two previous sessions.
   Brokers said some of the selling pressure came from slumping
prices in the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation and
interest rates.
   Evidence of economic strength that emerged from government
reports last week suggested that inflation could intensify, eroding
the value of fixed-income investments and dampening hope of an
easier monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.

<HEAD>High Court Agrees to Hear Racketeering, Bankruptcy and Age Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday, in a case
brought by phone customers in Minnesota, to consider making it
easier for people to use a federal anti-racketeering law to sue
businesses.
   The court also agreed to hear a Reagan administration appeal
aimed at allowing some creditors to collect more money from debtors
who declare bankruptcy.
   The justices also agreed to study the case of a laid-off
Pennsylvania man in a matter that could decide an important issue
for lawsuits alleging age bias in employment.
   In another case, the court refused to let states and local
governments regulate the prices which most of the nation's cable
television operators charge for basic service.
   In the anti-racketeering case, the court said it will hear an
appeal by phone customers in Minnesota who have accused
Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. of trying to bribe state public
utility officials.
   The phone subcribers sued the company under a law known as the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
   They said the company beginning in 1980 tried illegally to win
rate increases by offering gifts, employment offers, tickets to
sporting and cultural events and other favors to members of the
Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.
   The suit was thrown out by a federal judge and that ruling was
upheld last September by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said the phone users failed to allege a
continuing pattern of racketeering activity required to make a case
under the RICO act.
   The Supreme Court is being asked to choose among various
theories of how difficult it should be to maintain such a lawsuit.
   In the bankruptcy case, the court said it will review a decision
denying the government's claim for some interest payments on taxes
owed by a bankrupt company.
   The case stems from a reorganization petition filed by Ron Pair
Enterprises before a bankruptcy judge in Detroit in 1984.
   The government said the company owed $53,278 in taxes, penalties
and interest accrued prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.
   The company agreed to pay the amount, but refused to pay
additional interest accrued after the bankruptcy filing.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the
government in September. Justice Department lawyers said the
appeals court ruling could prove costly to the government.
   In the age discrimination case, the justices agreed to decide
whether Eugene F. Brieck's lawsuit against his former employer,
Harbison-Walker Refractories, should proceed to a jury trial.
   In July 1982, several employees of Harbison-Walker's Iron and
Steel Marketing Support Group were laid off, including Brieck. He
then was 55.
   Brieck sued Harbison-Walker in Pittsburgh in 1984, contending
that he was laid off and not recalled to work because of his age.
   U.S. District Judge Gerald J. Weber threw out Brieck's suit, but
the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Brieck's suit last
June 19.
   In the cable TV case, the court, without comment, rejected
arguments that the deregulation effected in 1986 by Congress and
the Federal Communications Commission left subscribers vulnerable
to illegal monopoly pricing.
   Most of the nation's 7,800 cable TV operators provide both basic
and ``premium'' services. For an extra monthly fee, subscribers
receive channels offering exclusive sports and movie programming.
   Prior to 1984, the FCC allowed local communities to regulate the
rates charged for basic cable service but not for premium service
rates.
   Congress in 1984 enacted the Cable Communications Policy Act,
which lets local authorities regulate basic cable rates only in the
absence of ``effective competition.''
   Defining ``effective competition'' was left up to the FCC, and
the commission's definition paved the way for the deregulation of
basic-service rates charged by more than 90 percent of all cable
operators.
   The appeal acted on Monday was filed by lawyers for Connecticut,
New York City, the National League of Cities and the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   Lawyers for the commission and the cable operators association
urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   In other cases, the court:
   _Agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed to
promote competitive bidding on government contracts. At issue is
the proper boundary between presidential and congressional power.
   _Refused to let the Dalkon Shield's maker set up a $15 million
emergency fund to help women who say the contraceptive device left
them infertile. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that
blocks creation of the fund pending the outcome of bankruptcy
proceedings for A.H. Robins Co. Inc., which manufactures the device.
   _Agreed to decide whether an airline may be forced to reinstate
workers when their strike ends, making necessary the layoffs of
trainees and employees who crossed the picket lines. The court said
it will study an appeal by Trans World Airlines in a dispute
stemming from a 1986 strike by flight attendants.
   _Let stand a ruling that makes it easier for investors to sue
their brokers over the collapse in 1984 of a $3 billion oil and
natural gas investment fund.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Texas whether states may impose
sales taxes on most books, newspapers and magazines while exempting
religious publications.

   Steel production rose to 1.991 million tons in
the week ended March 19, an increase of 1.2 percent from the
previous week's 1.967 million tons, the American Iron and Steel
Institute reported Monday.
   The industry's production amounted to 92.7 percent of capacity
during the week, compared with 91.6 percent in the previous week.
   Estimated figures for the year to date showed production at
21.726 million net tons, an increase of 34.8 percent from the
16.115 million net tons in the previous year. The steel operations
of USX Corp., the nation's largest steel producer, were shut down

<TEXT>
   A New York real estate firm on
Monday announced plans to erect Europe's tallest building _ a
53-story, 838-foot office tower _ on sprawling fairgrounds in this
West German city.
   Tishman Speyer Properties said the project, which it valued at
$375 million, will be financed by Citibank.
   The skyscraper, with its 920,000 square feet of office space,
will surpass the Palac Kultury of Warsaw, Poland, as Europe's
tallest building. The Palac Kultury, has 42 stories and is 790 feet
tall.
   Frankfurt Mayor Wolfram Brueck said the building is expected to
be completed by 1991.
   Tishman Speyer President Jerry Speyer, appearing at a press
conference with the mayor, said his company already has received
rental inquiries about the building.
   Frankfurt, West Germany's flourishing banking and finance
center, has been expanding in recent years. New office buildings
have sprouted up in the city's center, and decaying downtown
neighborhoods have been renovated.
   The fairgrounds are not far from the city's downtown shopping
area, its main train station and banking district.
   Tishman Speyer manages a portfolio of properties valued at $4
billion, the company said in a statement. The company currently has
$1 billion worth of projects under development, including the
Beijing American Express Center, an office and apartment complex in
China.

   Corn and soybean futures prices closed higher
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat prices fell.
   Soybean futures gained as much as 7\ cents a bushel. Prices rose
early on rumors of new Soviet buying and got a boost later in the
day when the South American agricultural newsletter Safras y
Mercado dropped its Brazilian soybean crop estimate by 400,000
metric tons due to dry weather in an important soybean region.
   Wheat futures retreated on profit-taking by traders who had
purchased contracts after the Agriculture Department's announcement
late Friday that it had targeted the Soviet Union for 1 million
metric tons of wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to { cent higher with the

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States declined by three this week to total 943, Baker
Hughes Inc. announced.
   This week's decrease was much smaller from the previous week,
when the count lost 32 rigs to total 946. A year ago, the count
totaled 784, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The rig count reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker company, tallies
the number of working rigs and the count is the widely-watched
industry index of drilling activity.
   Hughes Tool Co., which merged this year with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the number of working
rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Wyoming lost six rigs and
Texas was down by five this week. Ohio's count was down by three,
while North Dakota and and Pennsylvania each lost two rigs.
   States posting increases included New Mexico and Kansas, each of
which gained four rigs. Colorado's and California's counts were
each up by two. Oklahoma gained one rig, while Louisiana lost one
rig.

<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC has been
ordered to pay $1.36 million in fines for violating health and
safety laws in connection with two refinery blasts that killed
three men and seriously injured two others, the government said
Monday.
   The fine was the highest ever levied under the Health and Safety
at Work Act enacted in 1974, officials said.
   High Court Judge Lord Allanbridge said he imposed ``substanial''
fines because ``there were obvious hazards to the safety and lives
of employees and others'' at the refinery near Falkirk in central
Scotland where the explosions occurred nine days apart in March
1987.
   The company pleaded guilty to two charges of breaking the health
and safety act.
   After the ruling, the government's chief inspector for
factories, David Eves, said the explosions showed ``the ever
present potential for serious incidents must not be
underestimated.''
   He said in a statement that ``these incidents .... cost the
lives of three men, as well as a great deal of human suffering and
the loss to the management of the company of millions of pounds in
lost production and plant repairs.''
   Company officials were not available for comment Monday evening.
   The judge fined the company 250,000 pounds ($455,000) for the
first explosion, which was heard 20 miles away and hurled a
three-ton steel plate more than half a mile.
   The first blast occurred when workers from two subcontractors
began taking apart a section of machinery that had not been drained
of flammable gases and liquids.
   Liquid began leaking out and then exploded, killing James Bruce,
40, and Philip Mellon, 35, and seriously injuring Ian Taylor and
Allan Bissett. The fire took two days to put out.
   In the second incident, BP was fined 500,000 pounds ($910,000)
for disconnecting a safety alarm at another unit where an explosion
and fire killed George Spiers, 52.

<TEXT>
   The West German and French finance
ministers praised the first meeting of their bilateral economic
council Monday and pledged to boost cooperation on monetary issues.
   The ministers said they did not talk about proposals for a
European central bank during their landmark meeting, but agreed to
meet again before the summer, in Paris.
   Gerhard Stoltenberg, the West German finance minister, said
Monday's meeting reviewed economic developments in the two nations,
analyzed budget and tax plans and began examining ways of boosting
cooperation in monetary policy.
   French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur also praised the
session, and said he was pleased with Franco-German economic
cooperation, particularly the close contact between the two
nations' central banks.
   ``I am especially happy about the excellent cooperation that has
existed between the Bundesbank and the Banque de France,'' he told
reporters after the three-hour session.
   The Franco-German Economic Council was established in January as
a way of better coordinating policy between the two neighboring
nations.
   The council is to meet four times a year, and comprise the
nations' finance and economics ministers and the heads of the two
central banks.
   West Germany's central bank president, Karl Otto Poehl, is known
to have been skeptical about the council because of fears that it
may infringe upon his Bundesbank's independence.
   But Poehl praised Monday's session, and said the council would
help Europe achieve its goal of a barrier-free internal market by
1992.
   Both Stoltenberg and Balladur said the council would work to
better coordinate 1988 budgets in both nations, and concentrate on
seeking ways of achieving economic growth.

   General Electric Co. launched a double-pronged
attack Monday in its bid for Roper Corp. by boosting its tender
offer to $507 million and filing lawsuits challenging Roper's
agreement to merge with Whirlpool Corp.
   GE's latest bid, up $9 a share to $54 for Roper's outstanding
stock, surpasses the $50-a-share sweetened bid Whirlpool made last
week for the appliance and lawn equipment maker.
   In the second wave of lawsuits filed in the hotly contested bid
for Augusta, Ga.-based Roper, GE charged that Roper's board failed
to act in the best interest of shareholders and, together with
Whirlpool, violated federal disclosure laws.
   In a statement issued after the stock market closed, Roper said
it is reviewing GE's new tender offer and plans to hold a board
meeting later in the week to determine the company's position on
the sweetened bid.
   Roper rose $2.50 a share in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading to close at $55.50 a share. Roper jumped $5.75 a share on
Friday.
   GE's two lawsuits, filed in separate courts in Delaware, counter
a suit filed Friday in which Whirlpool accused GE of trying to
``sabotage'' the definitive merger agreement Whirlpool reached with
Roper's board of directors on Feb. 29.
   GE said in court papers it contacted Robert Cook, Roper's
president and chief executive officer, about a possible acquisition
in November but was turned down.
   Three months later, Roper's board authorized a $37.50-a-share
merger with Whirlpool after Whirlpool threatened to mount a hostile
takeover bid, papers filed in Delaware State Court showed.
   GE, which entered into the fray March 6 with a $45-a-share
offer, charged that Roper failed to ``test the price'' before
agreeing to merge with Whirlpool. GE also charged that Roper
concealed GE's interest in the company when it advised shareholders
to tender to Whirlpool.
   In an attempt to ``lock up'' its agreement with Whirlpool, Roper
gave the Benton Harbor, Mich.-based company an option to purchase
1.6 million newly issued shares for $37.50 if the deal fell
through, a move GE charged would make any subsequent Roper
acquisition more expensive. GE is seeking to block the issue and
transfer of those shares.
   In a separate suit filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware, GE
charged that both Whirlpool and Roper failed to adequately disclose
terms of their merger agreement under Securities and Exchange
Commission laws and neglected to mention GE's interest in Roper.
   Whirlpool, which threw the battle into the courtroom on Friday,
alleged in its suit that a GE executive personally tried to
persuade Roper to break its contract with Whirlpool. The suit said
GE ``intentionally, maliciously and unjustifiedly engaged in a
continuing course of conduct to sabotage'' the deal.
   Part of Whirlpool's lawsuit seeks $117 million in damages, or
the difference between its $50-a-share offer and original offer.
   GE vowed to ``vigorously defend itself'' against the charges and
seeks to transfer the suit from U.S. District Court in Grand
Rapids, Mich., to federal court in Delaware.
   Whirlpool said its suit is ``similar in theory'' to Pennzoil
Co.'s legal battle with Texaco Inc. over Texaco's acquisition of
Getty Oil Co.
   Texaco agreed to settle the suit for $3 billion after Pennzoil
won a $10.3 billion judgment against the oil giant on charges that
Texaco prompted Getty to back out of an agreement with Pennzoil.
   Roper has been supportive of Whirlpool's efforts. In endorsing
Whirlpool's sweetened bid last week, Roper's Cook said the company
``has a strong desire to see this combination successfully
completed.'' He had no further comment when contacted Monday.
   Analysts say a Roper-Whirlpool merger would move Whirlpool ahead
of GE as the nation's leading appliance maker. Whirlpool has said
it would expand Roper from a maker of cooking ranges into a
producer and marketer of a full line of appliances.
   But the acquisition of Roper would help GE secure its position
in the gas stove market and enhance its supplier relationship with
Sears, Roebuck & Co.
   Long limited to electric ranges, GE decided a year ago to widen
its market share by selling gas stoves. Since then GE has purchased
gas stoves from four companies, including Roper, said GE spokesman
Jack Batty from the company's headquarters in Fairfield, Conn.
   In addition, analysts estimate that roughly two-thirds of
Roper's sales come from its agreement to supply Sears with its
kitchen appliance and lawn equipment products.
   Roper reported net income of $24 million on sales of $703
million in fiscal 1987.

   Stocks stumbled Monday over inflation fears and
lingering post-crash anxiety among large institutional investors,
resulting in the slowest trading volume this year.
   ``The buying interest in the equity market disappeared here
today,'' said Ronald B. Doran, manager of institutional trading at
the First Albany Corp. brokerage. ``The institutional investors are
doing little of anything.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which hit the highest
level since the Oct. 19 collapse twice last week, dropped sharply
at the opening and never recovered, closing at 2,067.14, down
20.23. Broader market indices also fell.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange fell to 128.83 million
shares, slightly more than half the Friday volume of 245.75 million
shares and the lowest level since a 111.58 million-share day Dec.
29.
   Much of the trading was confined to stocks of companies targeted
in rumored or actual acquisitions.
   ``Beyond takeover deals, nothing is happening,'' said Lawrence
Wachtel, a Wall Street analyst at Prudential Bache Securities Co.
``To a degree, the market is absent of ideas.''
   Brokers said falling prices in the bond market contributed to
the selling mood by signaling higher inflation and interest rates.
This provided many investors with an excuse to cash in stocks that
had gained recently.
   The reluctance of market participants to commit themselves to
stocks for more than a short time reflected an underlying anxiety
that has persisted since the October collapse.
   ``There are very nervous people out there,'' said Hank
Striefler, vice president on the trading floor at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Losing issues outnumbered gainers by more than a 2-to-1 margin
in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, with 1,042 down, 502
up and 444 unchanged.
   Among the most notable blue-chip losers, Goodyear fell 1~ to
63~, DuPont fell 1[ to 87{, Woolworth fell 1[ to 47, Alcoa fell 1[
to 45| and Philip Morris fell 1[ to 93.
   Takeover activity boosted several prominent stocks. Roper gained
2{ to 55{, reflecting a heightened battle for the appliance maker
by General Electric and Whirlpool. Koppers jumped 3} to 57{ after a
group led by Beazer PLC sweetened its offer for the construction
company from $45 per share to $56.
   Kansas City Southern jumped 8} to 55 after an investor group
offered $60 a share for the railroad and financial services concern.
   Conflicting news about oil prices reverberated through petroleum
stocks, which ended mixed. Kerr McGee fell 1[ to 37], Chevron
droped { to 46~, and Occidental Petroleum rose 2 to 29.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 150.02 million shares.
   As measured by the Wilshire 5000 Equity Index, the value of all
U.S. stocks fell by $20.25 billion Monday to $2.661 trillion, off
0.76 percent from Friday.
   The NYSE index of all listed issues fell 1.18 to 151.47.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 2.60 to 312.04,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 2.38 to 268.74.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.93
to 298.18. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market fell 3.01 to 378.57.

   The dollar fell against all major currencies
except the Canadian dollar in quiet trading Monday, mirroring a
selloff in both the stock and bond markets.
   Gold prices jumped as much as $5 a troy ounce in active trading,
spurred by a rally in oil prices. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid price for gold of $449.45 a troy ounce as of 4
p.m. EST, up from $444 an ounce late Friday.
   Gold prices moved in concert with crude oil futures prices,
which pierced the $17-a-barrel level before sliding back late in
the trading session on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Currency dealers said the dollar moved in a narrow trading range
throughout the day. Trading was quieter than usual because a
national holiday in Japan kept financial institutions closed.
   The dollar continued to give back ground after gaining last week
on a better-than-expected government report that put the U.S. trade
deficit for January at $12.4 billion.
   A selloff in the stock market, which saw the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials drop 20.23 points to 2,067.14, and lower bond
prices ``took a little momentum away from the upside of the
dollar,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief currency dealer at Harris Trust
and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Traders also said the strengthening Japanese yen took its toll
on the dollar. ``People are talking a lot about strong economic
growth in Japan,'' said James McGroarty, vice president at Discount
Corp. He said the speculation about Japanese growth has heated up
interest in buying the yen.
   In London, the dollar was quoted at 126.85 yen late Monday
compared with 128.35 yen in Tokyo late Friday. Later in New York,
the dollar closed at 126.92 yen, down from 128.00 yen on Friday.
   One British pound cost $1.8285 late Monday in London, slightly
more expensive than late Friday's $1.8235. In New York, it cost
$1.8297 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.8240 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.6894 West German marks, down from 1.69575; 1.3986 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4040; 5.7545 French francs, down from 5.7590;
1,249.00 Italian lire, down from 1.255.50, and 1.24905 Canadian
dollars, up from $1.24885.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.6880 West German marks, down from 1.6950; 1.3970 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4010; 5.7380 French francs, down from 5.7480;
1.8970 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9010; 1,249.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,252.50, and 1.2494 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2495.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $450.20 a
troy ounce, up from $445.20 on Friday, in reaction to higher oil
prices and the specter of inflation. But as sentiment in the oil
market became bearish later in the session, gold prices began to
recede.
   In London, gold jumped $6.25 an ounce to a late bid price of
$449.50. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal was up $5.50 an ounce to
a late bid of $450.50. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at
$448.26 bid, up 36 cents from Saturday's late bid.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to a late bid price of
$6.47 a troy ounce from Friday's $6.31. On New York's Comex, silver
closed at $6.447 a troy ounce, up from $6.365 an ounce on Friday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New York Co. said Monday it was
beginning a $1.08 billion tender offer for Irving Bank Corp. after
having received approval to make the bid from the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   The SEC approved the registration statement on Friday, allowing
Bank of New York to issue its prospectus, Bank of New York
spokesman Owen Brady said.
   Irving spokesman David Santos dismissed the development as
``pretty much a non-event.''
   Bank of New York began its hostile attempt to acquire Irving
last September, a struggle that has been widely followed by bankers
because unfriendly takeovers are unusual in the banking industry.
Its tender offer expires at midnight on April 15.
   Irving's board last week amended its anti-takeover plan to make
it harder for a slate of new Irving directors to scuttle rights if
they win a proxy fight at Irving's annual meeting April 21.
   Bank of New York already has nominated a 16-director slate to
compete with Irving's slate at the meeting. The bank said it would
fight Irving's amended anti-takeover plan in the courts.

   Platinum futures prices surged above $500 a troy ounce Monday,
helped by early gains in oil prices and a generally positive
economic outlook.
   Oil prices settled mixed, however. On other markets, gold and
silver futures advanced; soybean futures were sharply higher while
the grains were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   The contract for April delivery of platinum settled $6.90 higher
at $504.20 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The move marked
only the second time since Jan. 20 that the April platinum contract
has finished above the psychologically important $500 barrier.
   Analysts said gains Monday in all the precious metals _
platinum, gold, silver and palladium _ were driven primarily by a
sharp increase in crude oil futures prices early in the day.
   But when oil prices later fell steeply, the metals gave up only
some of their gains, indicating other supportive factors were at
work.
   The weak dollar, increased U.S. auto sales and the generally
positive tone of recent economic data are all bullish for metals
prices, said Jacques Luben, executive director of investments for
the Platinum Guild International.
   ``It seems as though the consensus is that interest rates will
remain relatively low for the remainder of the year, we may see
higher inflation and we probably won't see a recession this year,''
Luben said.
   Monday's performance was ``a reassuring vote of confidence for
the metals'' but the next few sessions will show just how deep that
confidence runs, said Jack Barbanel, director of futures trading
for Gruntal & Co. in New York.
   ``We're either at the early stage of some new buying momentum or
we're seeing an upside correction in a downside metals market,'' he
said.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $4.90 to $7.20
higher with April at $449.20 a troy ounce; silver was 8 cents to
10.3 cents higher with March at $6.447 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil's early jump above $17 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange was triggered partly by speculation that OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman would announce a meeting of OPEC's pricing
committee at a Tuesday news conference, said Nauman Barakat, an
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   But prices came tumbling down later in the session when Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd confirmed the country was ``offering discounts,
quite indiscriminately, to almost everybody,'' Barakat said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 8
cents higher with April at $16.49 a barrel; heating oil was .12
cent lower to .35 cent higher with April at 45.40 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was unchanged to .12 cent higher with April at
46.11 cents a gallon.
   Soybean and corn futures settled sharply higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade while wheat prices fell.
   Soybean futures rose early in the session on rumors of new
Soviet buying and got a boost later in the day when the
agricultural newsletter Safras y Mercado dropped its Brazilian
soybean crop estimate by 400,000 metric tons due to dry weather,
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat settled 2} cents lower to { cent higher with March at
$2.96\ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4} cents higher with March at
$2.01{ a bushel; oats were 5{ cents lower to { cent higher with
March at $1.90{ a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 10 cents higher
with March at $6.30 a bushel.
   Frozen pork belly futures settled sharply lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while livestock futures were mixed.
   The drop in pork belly futures was largely due to expectations,
later confirmed, of a sharp increase in bellies in cold storage.
The USDA announced after the close that nearly 67 million pounds of
pork bellies were stored in the nation's freezers on Feb. 29,
compared to 34.7 million pounds a year ago.
   Sharply lower cash hog prices weighed on the livestock futures,
said Walter Kowalski, an analyst in Chicago with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .50 cent higher with April
at 73.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .10
cent higher with March at 82.70 cents a pound; hogs were .65 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with April at 45.55 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were unchanged to 1.70 cents lower with March at 54.10
cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 1.7 points lower at 270.60.

<HEAD>Batus Begins Proxy Solicitation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Batus Inc. took its campaign for Farmers
Group Inc. to the company's shareholders Monday, soliciting proxies
to support reconsideration of its bid for one of the nation's
largest insurers.
   Batus said the non-binding resolution will be introduced at
Farmers' annual stockholders' meeting May 20 at the company's Los
Angeles headquarters.
   On March 10, Farmers' board unanimously rejected a hostile
takeover offer of $63 a share, or $4.4 billion, and called upon its
shareholders to do the same. The offer was described as being
substantially less than the company is worth.
   The board, which has refused to enter into negotiations, also
announced it was exploring a variety of alternatives to the Batus
bid, including restructuring or consolidating with another company.
   Farmers said it has had discussions with an unidentified third
party about a possible leveraged buyout to counter the offer from
Batus, the U.S. subsidiary of British BAT Industries PLC.
   Farmers Group shares fell to $62.50, down $1.12{, in active
over-the-counter trading Monday.
   In seeking the proxies, Batus said its resolution would give
stockholders an opportunity to express their support for the
merger, at no less than $63 a share, and would encourage the
directors to pursue such a sale.
   In case a higher bidder emerged, the resolution recommends that
Farmers' directors ``consider in good faith whether to negotiate
with such a bidder.''
   Batus' latest maneuver ``was no surprise,'' said Tom Welch,
director of corporate investments for Farmers. ``We have been
expecting it.'' He declined further comment.
   Batus spokesman Wilson Wyatt Jr. said the solicitation was being
handled by The Carter Organization in New York.
   Wyatt also said Batus does not intend to oppose or take any
position with respect to the election of Farmers' nominees to the
board.
   Wyatt said that Batus, based in Louisville, owns 696,000 shares
of Farmers' stock, of which there were 68,916,614 shares
outstanding as of Oct. 31, 1987.
   Earlier this month, a federal judge in Nevada ordered Farmers to
place Batus' negotiation proposal in the proxy cards being sent to
shareholders for the meeting.
   The case was heard in Nevada because Farmers is incorporated
there.
   Batus, which owns a diversified group of businesses including
retailers Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's, began the bidding
in January with a $60 per share offer for Farmers.
   Farmers is the nation's third-largest home and auto insurer
after State Farm and Allstate and the seventh-largest property and
casualty insurer.
   Some analysts have said Batus needs to raise its offer by $5 to
$20 a share if it expects to acquire Farmers, which has about $11
billion in assets, mostly in insurance.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that state insurance
regulators and legislators had raised questions that could hinder
the Batus bid.
   Officials of the Texas State Board of Insurance have questioned
the company's ability to service the debt required to accomplish
the deal.
   In Ohio, the state House of Representatives has approved a
resolution expressing its concern about how the takeover might
affect Farmers' policyholders and employees in that state.
   A spokesman for Batus' British parent told the Journal that it
was responding to the questions from the Texas authorities and
believes it meets all the legal requirements to control insurance
companies in Texas and Ohio.
   Before its purchase of Farmers can be completed, Batus must get
approval from insurance regulators in nine states. Regulators in
several states, including Idaho, Illinois and Kansas, have asked
the company for more information, the Journal said.

<HEAD>Investor Group Offers $60 a Share for Kansas City Southern
Industries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group that owns an 11 percent
stake in Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. said Monday it was
offering $60 a share, or about $594 million, for the rest of the
railroad concern's common stock.
   Kansas City Southern, which also has interests in financial
services, said its board would consider the all-cash proposal soon
at a special meeting.
   The company has nearly 11.1 million shares outstanding, and the
investment group led by Howard Kaskel claims it controls about 1.2
million shares.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kansas City Southern
jumped $8.75 a share to $55.
   Kaskel outlined the merger proposal in a letter to Landon H.
Rowland, president and chief executive of Kansas City Southern, and
requested an opportunity to negotiate ``all aspects of the offer,
including price.''
   He said completing the proposal was subject to reaching a
definitive agreement, approval by the requisite number of directors
and stockholders and satisfaction of all regulatory requirements.
   But he warned that if the company's board rejected or failed to
act on the offer by April 4, ``we will be forced to commence a
proxy contest to elect directors who will actively pursue and
encourage the maximization of stockholder values.,''
   Kaskel said he had made various proposals to company management
over the past eight months on ways to maximize shareholder values.
   ``Unfortunately, you have rejected each of my suggestions,''
Kaskel wrote.
   In addition, he said he found it ``dismaying'' that the board
erected obstacles ``designed to entrench itself and to prevent
stockholders from realizing a full return on their investment.''
   Among these steps, Kaskel cited the recent issuance of about 1.4
million shares, or almost 15 percent of the company's
then-outstanding common stock, to employee stock ownership plans at
$49 a share.
   ``This could only have been motivated by the board's desire to
place substantial voting power in its hands as a means of
opposing'' proposals that may be brought before its shareholders,
the letter said.
   Kaskel also cited Kansas City Southern's continued efforts to
acquire the Southern Pacific Railroad despite Southern Pacific's
``binding agreement for its sale to the Denver Rio Grande.''
   Responding to the offer, Rowland said in a statement from
company headquarters in Kansas City that the company had received a
merger proposal from Kaskel and that it would be considered by the
company's board ``at a special meeting to be held shortly.''
   He said the company would have no further comment until the
board of directors had an opportunity to study the proposal.
   Kansas City Southern owns the Kansas City Southern Railroad
which operates on about 1,500 miles of track in Missouri, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas.
   It also owns 87 percent of DST Systems Inc., a Kansas City-based
concern that provides data systems and record-keeping services for
mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services
providers.
   The company also owns 80 percent of Janus Capital Corp., a
Denver-based concern that provides investment advice and had about
$915 million in funds under management at the end of February,
according to Kansas City Southern's vice president and secretary,
Albert Mauro.
   For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, Kansas City Southern reported
a profit of $17.7 million, or $1.82 a share, on revenue of $507.6
million.

   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III
heard testimony Monday in a court battle over three missing zeros
on a financial document that could cost Prudential Insurance Co. of
America millions of dollars.
   Prudential is trying to establish that a mortgage lien it holds
is for $92,885,000, even though a document records its value as
only $92,885 because of a clerical error.
   The lien is on eight ships once owned by United States Lines, a
shipping company whose assets are being sold off to satisfy
creditors under Bankruptcy Court supervision.
   The hearing before Buschman lasted past the normal close of
business hours Monday and lawyers for the various parties could not
be reached by telephone for comment.

<HEAD>Markets Mixed to Lower as Government Reports Budget Deficit for
February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government chalked up a $23.9 billion deficit in its
February spending after posting a rare budget surplus in January,
the Treasury Department reported Monday.
   Meanwhile, stock prices fell in the slowest trading of the year,
while the dollar followed suit and oil prices were mixed.
   The Treasury's latest monthly report on the government's
spending and revenues followed a $16.1 billion surplus in January
which had occurred because Social Security checks that month were
mailed early and counted in the December spending figures.
   So far this fiscal year, the government has run up a five-month
deficit of $89.7 billion, 4.9 percent lower than the red ink
incurred in the same period a year earlier.
   The Reagan administration is projecting a deficit of $146.7
billion for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, down 2.4 percent from
the $150.4 billion deficit in 1987.
   But many forecasters believe the small improvement will not be
realized because they think the administration has used overly
optimistic projections about the economy.
   On Wall Street, inflation fears and lingering post-crash anxiety
sent stocks tumbling across the board, with the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials dropping sharply at the opening and remaining
down throughout the trading session.
   The closely watched indicator closed at 2,067.14, down 20.23
points. Broader market indices also fell.
   Trading was also quiet on world currency markets. The dollar
fell against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar,
mirroring the stock market selloff and a decline in bond prices.
   Gold prices jumped as much as $5 a troy ounce in active trading,
spurred by a rally in oil prices. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid price for gold of $449.45 a troy ounce as of 4
p.m. EST, up from $444 an ounce late Friday.
   Gold prices moved in concert with crude oil futures prices,
which pierced the $17-a-barrel level before sliding back in late
trading, following a statement by Saudi King Fahd on prices and
production.
   In remarks carried by the official Saudi press agency, Fahd
suggested that cheating on production quotas and prices by some
members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries encouraged further weakness in prices.
   That punctured a rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
where contracts for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude oil, closed at $16.49 per 42-gallon barrel,
down 9 cents from Friday. They had been up as much as 45 cents
during the day.
   Among refined products for April, wholesale heating oil closed
0.35 cent higher at 45.40 cents a gallon, after having touched
46.70 cents a gallon earlier. Unleaded gasoline gave up a 1.41-cent
gain to close 0.12 cent higher at 46.11 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Campbell To Change Long-Time Label _ But Only On Cooking Soups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. is replacing the
red-and-white labels on ``cooking soups'' used primarily as recipe
ingredients, but plans to keep the familiar 90-year-old design on
its eating soups, the company said Monday.
   The new labels will feature color photographs of meals that can
be made from recipes using Campbell's 16 varieties of cooking
soups, according to company spokesman Kevin Lowery.
   The recipe for the pictured meal will be printed on the
underside of the label along with another recipe and a cookbook
offer.
   The traditional red-and-white label was born in 1898, when a
Campbell executive was so inspired by the colors in Cornell
University's new football team uniforms that he ordered the change
from the previous orange-and-black label, Lowery said.
   The red-and-white label went on to win the Gold Medallion for
Excellence at the 1900 Paris Exposition and was immortalized in pop
art by the late Andy Warhol.
   Cooking soups, such as chicken broth, cream of mushroom and
tomato, constitute one-third of Campbell's market.
   Campbell initially will use the new labels on cans produced and
sold in nine western states, where the company will judge consumer
reaction.
   The company indicated the change, the product of one year's
research, could help consumers by saving shopping time and aiding
menu planning.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borg-Warner Corp. has sold its credit-reporting
subsidiary, Chilton Corp., to TRW Inc. for about $360 million in
cash, the companies announced Monday.
   Borg-Warner said it sold Dallas-based Chilton, which it acquired
in March 1986 for $252 million, to help pay off debt incurred in
its 1987 leveraged buyout.
   Borg-Warner went private last year in the buyout led by a
Merrill Lynch & Co. unit and must pay off $1.7 billion in debts by
the end of 1988. The buyout, which was engineered to avert a
hostile takeover by GAF Corp., left Borg-Warner with total debt of
more than $4 billion.
   TRW Chairman Ruben F. Mettler said in a statement issued in
Cleveland that the acquisition fits into TRW's previously announced
strategy of increasing its presence in the commercial information
systems business.
   The sale of Chilton leaves Borg-Warner with interests in
chemicals and plastics, automotive parts and security and armored
guard services. Borg-Warner already has divested itself of other
assets, including its BWAC Inc. finance unit and its industrial
products group, to pay off debt incurred in the buyout.
