   In the year since he lost his legs trying
to block a trainload of munitions, S. Brian Willson has become a
symbol of inspiration in the movement for peace in Central America.
   Hundreds have been stirred to maintain 'round-the-clock protests
at the Concord Naval Weapons Station since last Sept. 1, the day
the slow-moving Navy train, under orders not to stop, rolled over
Willson as he sat on the tracks. The demonstrators, surrounded by
picket signs, sleeping bags and American flags, stand by as trains
and trucks carry weapons across Port Chicago Highway, which cuts
through the base.
   ``Because of what I chose to do and what the Navy chose to do,
I'm a symbol and that can be used for good, I think,'' Willson, 47,
said this week in an interview at the San Francisco-based Institute
for the Practice of Nonviolence, which he founded with his wife,
Holly Rauen.
   The soft-spoken Willson, a Vietnam veteran born on the Fourth of
July and raised in a conservative, politically inactive family in
Ashville, N.Y., said he's more convinced than ever of the need to
campaign for peace and a halt to weapons shipments to Central
American nations.
   ``I don't think it was a mistake and I don't regret what I did.
I'm sorry the train ran over me and that I lost my legs. It's a
drag,'' he said. ``I feel more liberated than ever to speak the
truth, so I don't have any desire or wish to back off,'' he said.
   In the past year, Willson has spoken across the country. At the
scene of the accident 40 miles east of San Francisco,
demonstrations, prayers, rallies and civil disobedience still
elicit headlines, thanks to high-profile protesters such as the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, Joan Baez, Martin Sheen, author Alice Walker
and peace activist Daniel Ellsberg.
   An ecumenical service will be held at the weapons station
Thursday to mark the anniversary of Willson's maiming.
   It will be the first time since June 10 that Willson has visited
the spot where he inspires protesters but riles many of the 450
people in the adjacent town of Clyde, who have grown weary of the
sight and sound of demonstrators on their doorstep.
   When demonstrators posted a handmade sign reading ``Brian,''
made to look like the town sign of ``Clyde'' across the road from
the base gates, residents were outraged. The sign came down after a
session with a county mediator.
   Don Elam is typical of most townspeople today. He complains the
protest site is an eyesore and demonstrators are ``left-wing
radicals who sympathize with communist governments.''
   The protesters meet with a wide range of responses. Earlier this
week, 19-year-old Spaulding Brook of Vermont was leaning on the
base fence near a sign reading ``Wage Peace'' when a man drove
past, blared ``Boo'' through a megaphone and gestured obscenely. A
carload of men yelled, ``Go home.'' Others driving by flash peace
signs.
   The county has spent about $335,000 for patrols of Contra Costa
Sheriff's deputies, who have arrested some 325 people since last
Sept. 1, according to Sgt. Doug Sizemore.
   Tired of the marathon protest and concerned about safe
transportation of explosives across a 200-foot intersection, the
Navy wants to build a $10 million overpass to takes vehicles over
the highway, said base spokesman Dan Tikalsky.
   While the Navy seeks funding from the Defense Department, others
have turned to the courts.
   County prosecutors have failed to convict any protesters.
Willson has sued the Navy and the crew of the train that refused to
stop, and the crew has countersued.
   The Northern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union sued to stop use of a painful choke hold on protesters being
arrested. A federal court rejected a county request for permission
to remove protesters' tables, chairs and picket signs from the edge
of the highway.
   So the demonstrators remain, suffering occasional attacks with
eggs, bottles and obscenities.
   Chuck Goodmacher of the Mount Diablo Peace Center in nearby
Walnut Creek, which helps coordinate the protests, says the local
antagonism is ironic because, in 1986, voters only narrowly
rejected a measure urging the government to halt arms shipments
through the county until there was a regional peace settlement in
Central America.
   Sandy Hillard is one of the few locals who have joined the
protests. Her car has been painted with swastikas, pelted with eggs
and had its tires flattened.
   ``I wish they (protest opponents) could get to know us better
before making a judgment,'' Hillard said. ``It's unfortunate to
live in a community with fears of getting your house burned down.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She was a waif-like but winsome coquette whose
delicious romantic romps added a touch of whimsy to the 1950s and
early '60s. Today, Leslie Caron, the ``Gigi'' of yesteryear, is a
grandmother who's about to portray the matriarch of fashion Coco
Chanel in a TV movie.
   She's also written a book of short stories called ``Vengeance,''
and a screenplay she describes as a ``parable of war.''
   ``I suppose I have two sides to my nature,'' Caron said in an
interview. ``But I'm not cute. Whatever I am, cute is not the
word.''
   Caron retains a place in film history, a time when the musical
embodied the spirit and romance of an era. Beginning in 1951 with
Gene Kelly in ``An American in Paris,'' through ``Daddy Longlegs''
with Fred Astaire in 1955 to 1958's Academy Award-winning ``Gigi,''
she won the hearts of audiences around the world.
   But now, more than three decades later at the age of 57, she is
remembered mainly as America's French gamine-in-residence.
   While still a teen-ager, Caron was plucked from a Paris ballet
by Kelly, who took her to Hollywood where she went under contract
for MGM.
   ``I was stereotyped after `An American in Paris,''' she said.
``And I think Americans a long, long time ago decided that I was
cute, a gamine and all those things. Actually, I'm a very serious
person.''
   Caron credits much of her artistic bent to the legacy left by
her American-born mother, a dancer whose own dreams went
unfulfilled. ``My mother protected me and helped me fulfill my
wishes. But I think they were the expression of her wishes.''
   Her mother's suicide in 1967 stoked her determination and left
``a feeling of unfinished business.'' As she approached 40, she
took up writing and refuge in Paris, her hometown.
   A word processer sits on a table i her living room. Caron had
just returned from the printer with the script of the film she
wrote and plans to direct.
   ``It's a moral tale. It's about the incapacity of people to get
along. In other words, it's a parable of war on a family scale,''
she said.
   The screenplay, whose title she refuses to divulge, is to be a
family affair. She hopes her children, Christopher and
actress-daughter, Jennifer, who has given her a grandchild, will
participate in the project. Both are the children of her second
marriage to Peter Hall, director of Britain's National Theater.
Caron has been married three times.
   She has written what she calls a ``good part'' for herself,
meaning neither cute nor guileless. ``I might have been innocent
and guileless when I was 18,'' she said. ``But, my God, the years
have passed and I've lived quite a lot of drama. And the public
keeps seeing the same films on the television.''
   In 1984, Doubleday and Co. published a collection of her short
stories, ``Vengeance.''
   ``They are sort of brutal,'' she said. ``No, cruel is the better
word. I do have a sharp eye and a wicked sense of humor.''
   As a one-time star still at work, Caron is finally able to
stretch herself as an actress in a variety of roles.
   ``For the last 10 years, the spectrum of parts I'm offered just
swings widely,'' she said.
   Most recently, she portrays Chanel in a syndicated TV miniseries
for the fall season, ``The Man Who Lived at the Ritz.'' Based on
the best-selling novel by A.E. Hotchner, it is the story of an
American artist, played by Perry King, caught in wartime Paris
between the Resistance and the Nazis.
   Last year, Caron played the submissive wife of Lenin, portrayed
by Ben Kingsley in the movie, ``The Train,'' which recounted the
exiled Lenin's journey home to start the Russian Revolution. She
also appeared in an episode last year on TV's ``Falcon Crest.''
   Caron thinks of herself as a survivor.
   ``I remember a rather cruel producer, cruel and rude, who said
as she hired me that she so admired (Brigitte) Bardot for retiring
when she was losing her looks,'' Caron recalled. ``I think it's so
against everything I believe because so long as there is life,
there's a contribution you can make. ... I think one must not just
be banking on one's looks.''

   The Cuban government has checked 2.7 million
people _ more than a quarter of the island's population _ for AIDS
and found 248 infected with the virus, the Cuban news agency Prensa
Latina reports.
   Ten people have died of the disease and 28 are ill, the agency
said. It was not clear if the dead and sick were included among the
248 found to be infected.
   People who test positively for AIDS antibodies are tested
further and confined in a health center, Prensa Latina said in the
report Wednesday. It said attempts are made to locate others they
may have infected with the disease, which has no known cure.
   People who test positive for AIDS antibodies do not necessarily
have the disease, but may later develop it.
   The agency said blood given by blood donors was tested for the
virus. But the dispatch, monitored in Mexico, did not say how
others were chosen for testing.
   Cuban authorities, the government news agency said, are carrying
out an extensive education campaign in an effort to stop the spread
of AIDS on the island of 10 million.
   The disease is spread primarily through sexual contact and
sharing of needles by drug users.

   Toxic algae have been detected off the

   An order issued by the district prefecture this week forbids any
commercial distribution of shellfish from the Abers coast, a

   Scientists from the French Institute for Research and

cause minor paralysis and blurred vision if eaten by humans.

<HEAD>Cerezo Administration Appears Secure Despite Coup Talk</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculation about a coup has
abounded in recent weeks, but interviews with government and
military officials, diplomats and civilian sectors linked to a May
coup bid suggested President Vinicio Cerezo's administration is
secure.
   The coup talk was exemplified by an Aug. 17 article on the
Cerezo administration's economic austerity measures in the
country's most widely read newspaper, Prensa Libre.
   The article, headlined ``Cerezo's Cynical Ploy,'' quoted three
of five congressmen as using the word ``coup,'' hinting one was
around the corner.
   ``In our country we suffer from the continuous coup syndrome,''
said Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera, referring to the succession
of military dictatorships that has dominated Guatemala during its
modern history.
   Cerezo, a 46-year-old lawyer and Christian Democrat, took office
in January 1986, heading the first elected civilian administration
in 16 years.
   ``People here don't yet know how to live in democracy. Some
believe that if they don't like a certain measure, the government
should be overthrown. Some small sectors still think like that,''
Cabrera said.
   On May 11, two columns of troops left their bases and marched
toward the capital in an effort to seize power, but the attempt was
quashed without a shot. Six officers were arrested and four more
disciplined.
   Cabrera said a few retired military officers and the National
Liberation Movement, a small rightist party, were among
destablizing elements. But he dismissed the threat they might pose.
   ``There is no possibility of a coup,'' he said.
   Defense Minister Gen. Hector Gramajo agreed. He said rightist
elements in the agricultural and business sector mounted ``a
large-scale psychological (pro-coup) campaign'' after tax reform in
1987.
   ``All they could come up with was May 11. It was a good deal for
us. We weeded out 10 less-than-brilliant officers. We discovered
and corrected vulnerabilities and were left with a greater capacity
to confront such eventualities,'' he said.
   ``The army is doing everything possible so that the era of coups
pertains to the past. Nonetheless, the traditional forces are doing
everything possible so that it does not.
   ``As of now, I'm winning,'' he said.
   Guatemala's ``traditional forces'' are those that control land
and business. Those sectors enjoyed a strong link with the armed
forces during the decades of military rule.
   Gramajo said the May coup bid ``was sponsored by a fascist
agricultural sector of feudal characteristics.''
   The National Agricultural Union groups the nation's principal
landowners. Edgar Alvarado, its secretary-eneral, denied any
connection with the May rebellion.
   He said the government has had an incoherent economic policy
since the tax reform, which was intended to increase government
revenues by making evasion more difficult.
   The overhaul irked private-sector rightists, many of whom
consider taxation a form of socialism.
   ``Private enterprise always tries to pay as little as possible,
the state always tries to take as much as it can,'' said Alvarado.
   ``We produce the hard currency. Others spend it,'' he said.
Agricultural exports including coffee, cotton, bananas and cardamom
account for about 85 percent of Guatemala's approximately $1
billion in 1987 hard currency earnings.
   Cerezo recently lifted price controls on basic foodstuffs and
raised prices of fuel, public transport and utilitilities. Faced
with growing discontent over the effect on working people's
purchasing power, he slightly rolled back the fuel price increase
and decreed a 5-cent-per-hour wage raise for the private sector.
   Private sector employees earn an average of about 50 cents an
hour.
   Alvarado said the president ``is pulling rabbits out of hats.
... He has lost credibility. He tells each sector something
different.''
   The private sector recognizes Cerezo's achievments during the
first 18 months of his term. Inflation, which had been running at
about 35 percent, was brought down to about 10 percent. The gross
national product, which decreased by 6 percent in 1985, is expected
to grow by 3 percent to 4 percent this year.
   Edgar Heinemann, head of the Chamber of Commerce and the
business federation CASIF, said, ``The government is going in ten
directions at the same time. The Finance Ministry does one thing,
the Economy Ministry another and the Central Bank another.''
   He said that during the first six months of 1987, about $240
million in private Guatemalan capital returned to the country to
spur development. But the trend ended with tax reform, he said.
   ``This year, there's capital flight,'' he said.
   But he said differences over economic policy won't prompt local
capital to foster or fund a coup.
   ``For us, the institutions are very important. A mistaken policy
decision is something temporal. The country is forever,'' he said.

   The by-product of the elephants featured in
``The Greatest Show On Earth'' is, as one might expect, mammoth.
   Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus officials were willing
to give away manure from King Tusk and his pachyderm pals during
the show's two-day stay here.
   However, few showed up to take advantage of the super-rich
fertilizer. The circus claims the manure is high in nitrates and
calcium, making it perfect for the backyard or window box gardener.
   There's one catch. Circus manure must dry for at least 90 days
before being spread or it will burn up the plants and soil.
   That didn't deter painter John Ellick, who scooped up 2{
20-gallon trash bags of elephant dung from a garbage bin full of
manure.
   Ellick said he can't wait to see what crops will pop up next
year from his 50-by-150-foot garden in Douglas about 50 miles
southeast of Lincoln.
   ``I might grow humongous tomatoes,'' he said. ``I could have
eggplants the size of footballs, cucumbers the size of tusks. I can
only imagine what next year's garden will be like.''

   Lt. Col. Richard Stammler was flying an Air
Force transport to a refueling rendezvous five miles over Scotland
when a familiar voice crackled over the radio.
   His younger brother, Capt. Robert Stammler, was calling from the
air tanker where he was evaluating the maneuver as part of his
assignment with the Strategic Air Command to train U.S. crews
stationed in Europe.
   ``When I heard his voice, I said, `Gosh, it's him,''' Richard
Stammler, 44, told his his hometown newspaper, the Erie News.
   As the two C-135s hurtled at 700 mph only 30 feet apart, the
brothers, who hadn't seen each other for two years, chatted briefly.
   The two had to keep their conversation official during the
15-minute refueling July 19, but got a chance two days later for a
longer reunion on the ground.
   Richard Stammler, commander of the Royal Air Force's 10th
Airborne Command and Control Squadron based in Mildenhall, England,
was flying an EC-135, a four-engine jet equipped with
communications and command electronics.
   His brother was on temporary assignment from the 46th Air
Refueling Squadron, Sawyer Air Force Base, Mich. He was aboard a
KC-135 from the RAF base at Fairford.
   Richard Stammler said that when he learned the refueling was to
be evaluated, he suspected his brother might be aboard the tanker.
Robert Stammler is one of only a few Air Force navigators assigned
to monitor the maneuver and had recently been assigned to Fairford.

<HEAD>Experts Say Tokyo Prone to Earthquake Like Massive One 65 Years
Ago</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report; note Sept. 1 anniversary date.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty-five years after a killer earthquake and
ensuing firestorms ravaged a crowded Tokyo, officials are alerting
people of the possibility of another massive one.
   They say it could come anytime between now and the next 20 years
and is expected to pack enough power to split the ground.
   The authorities are using the Sept. 1 anniversary of the 1923
Great Kanto Earthquake to organize information fairs and earthquake
drills _ and keep up vigilance among residents accustomed to
frequent, mostly harmless earthly shudders.
   ``We're constantly doing PR (public relations),'' said Takeshi
Yanagida of the Tokyo city government's Disaster Countermeasure
Bureau. ``Most people know enough to turn off the gas and keep
emergency supplies of food, water, money, underwear.
   ``In the event of a second Great Kanto Earthquake, what
authorities can do is limited. We need help from the people.''
   Much of Japan lies along a major fault at the juncture of
mammoth tectonic plates shifting slowly across the earth's surface.
Small earthquakes shake the country every day, most of them
unnoticed by humans. But to scientists maintaining a 24-hour watch,
they are signs of building pressure that must eventually culminate
in a powerful release.
   The resulting quake, they say, will likely register an 8 on the
open-ended Richter scale _ the Mexico City quake of 1985 measured
8.1 _ and will strike under or near the Kanto plain surrounding the
capital or along the crowded, 170-mile Tokai belt linking Tokyo and
the western city of Nagoya.
   ``In the worst-case scenario, the quake will come on a winter
evening when people are cooking their dinners, a day with a dry
northeasterly wind of about 22 kilometers per hour (14 mph),''
Yanagida said.
   Powerful enough to buckle walls and knock people off their feet,
it could set off fires from gas ranges and heaters that would burn
half a million homes, destroy one-third of Tokyo's living and
office space, kill 37,000 people and injure 78,000 more, scientists
say. A quake along the Tokai belt could kill up to 100,000.
   The tolls, while disastrous, would still be only a fraction of
the human cost of the 1923 disaster.
   Two minutes before noon on Sept. 1, 1923, the earth rose in a
violent upheaval. (Experts say that if the Richter scale had been
developed at the time it would have registered 7.8.) The earthquake
toppled houses and scattered embers from cooking fires, sparking
deadly firestorms that swept the capital region's rickety, densely
packed neighborhoods. When the embers had cooled, as many as
140,000 people had perished, mostly in the fires, and billions of
dollars worth of property lay in ruins or badly damaged.
   Masatoshi Rachi, then a 13-year-old farmer's son in eastern
Tokyo, recalled watching the firestorms approach after his family's
house had withstood the tremor.
   ``All around, sparks were falling like rain. People were
climbing onto their roofs and wetting them down,'' he said.
   ``Those who had lost their homes were setting up barracks,
finding space with relatives. Our house, which fortunately didn't
burn, was so full there was only room enough for people to sit _ 70
or 80 in all, relatives and strangers.''
   Rachi is now 78. Tougher building standards, fire and changes of
business have forced him to rebuild his home five times. Each time,
though, he has taken care to reinforce beams _ and to prepare a
parcel with stores of water, food, a flashlight, medicine.
   Rachi was not alone in learning lessons from the 1923 disaster.
The government restricted use of building bricks, stiffened
regulations on securing window glass and encouraged pioneering
architecture and engineering that allow skyscrapers to roll and
sway instead of buckling during tremors.
   It sent teams to study the devastation after the 1971 Los
Angeles quake, when highways collapsed, and the one that shook
Mexico's capital three years ago bringing on massive confusion
among families searching for their missing.
   Tokyo now has sturdier supports for its elevated highways and is
experimenting with a wireless system for emergency communications.
Recent experience has taught the Japanese they are likely to be
safer indoors during a quake.
   But despite the funds the government has poured into earthquake
prediction, ``The truth is, we're not 100 percent sure we can
predict the big one,'' said Hirofumi Yokoyama of the Meteorological
Agency's Earthquake Prediction division. ``We can be maybe 80
percent certain.
   ``The system is such that we should be able to predict a large
Kanto quake two or three days in advance,'' he said. ``We can't
tell exactly when, but we can say about where.''
   With luck, the information will be enough to prevent a
full-scale repetition of the catastrophe 65 years ago. Under an
advanced disaster-control program, trains will stop when a
tremendous quake occurs, public address systems will be triggered
automatically, people will congregate with their emergency kits at
government-designated sites and roadways will be cleared for
emergency vehicles.
   But the unknown element looms.
   ``I'm terrified of quakes,'' said the Tokyo government's
Yanagida. ``They're not like typhoons, which you can at least see.
Earthquakes can intensify after they start.
   ``The thing is, you just never know.''

   First it was the Volkswagen Beetle, then the hardy
Citroen Deux Chevaux.
   Now the famed Solex motorbike, dear to millions in 40 countries
and for many a symbol of youthful independence, is puttering into
the junkyard of transportation history.
   The last Solex _ a fat-tired bicycle with a tiny motor perched
atop its front wheel _ will roll off the assembly line in northern
city of St. Quentin at the end of the year, victim of poor
economics and Japanese enterprise.
   The Solex was invented in 1942, and more than 6 million have
been sold since. They run practically forever on just a suspicion
of gasoline, but need a good pedaling to get them rolling up
anything but the most modest incline.
   Michele Cotta, news director for France's TF1 television
network, perhaps summed it up best: ``Tears of nostalgia come to my
eyes. Not only because, like many of us, this mode of locomotion
evokes happy times. But with the Solex junked, it's a bit of our
youth they are destroying.''
   Ungainly, poorly balanced and far from elegant, the Solex
nonetheless became popular in the 1960s. With a top speed of 23
mph, it was a symbol of youth and economy.
   Motobecane, the company that produced bicycles and Solexes, went
bust in 1983, resurfacing as MBK Industrie with several investers,
including Japan's Yamaha. In 1986, Yamaha increased its stake in
the company to 80 percent.
   Takashi Ueoka, marketing director for MBK, said in an interview
Wednesday the company regretted killing Solex, but it had to be
done.
   ``It's like the Volkswagen Beetle,'' said Ueoka. ``It's the same
story. Many people have expressed their regret. But we had to make
a decision. Of course when I explain the situation, they understand.
   ``The Solex product is 45 years old,'' he said. ``It has been
very useful and well used. It sold in 40 countries, particularly
Africa and nearly all of Europe. The best year was 1964 when
380,000 were sold in France.''
   Only 2,700 found buyers last year, even at the price of about
$470.
   To better utilize the St. Quentin plant, which also makes
Motobecane bicycles and mopeds, the company is investing $28
million to modernize the equipment and introduce Yamaha models to
the production.
   Ueoka says economics win out over sentiment every time.
   ``It was my first motor as a teen-ager, when I was 14,'' said
Parisian Christophe Cachera. ``I had the impression of speed. It
was also a passage from childhood to adolescence. Too bad it's
going to disappear. If everybody in Paris had one, life would be a
lot easier.''
   Alas, it's only another sign of the times, Ms. Cotta wrote in
the popular daily Le Parisien.
   ``For how many did the Solex mark the first independence, the
first open spaces, the first conquests. But, it's condemned to
death, this first bike, because the youth of today go faster, are
more in a hurry to achieve maturity.''

   June Reinisch and Leonard A. Rosenblum, two
noted sex researchers, feel no pressure to establish the perfect
marriage. In fact, they're not even planning to live together.
   Because their home cities of New York and Indianapolis are so
far apart, the two have even decided on two marriage ceremonies,
and Reinisch says their long-distance relationship will continue
after the weddings.
   ``The marriage will not affect our careers,'' she said recently.
   The first ceremony will be Saturday at Sammy's Rumanian
Restaurant in New York. The second will be Sept. 10 at the
Indianapolis home of mutual friends.
   Reinisch, 45, is director of the famed Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University,
founded in the 1940s by Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey, one of the first
scientists to study human sexual behavior.
   Rosenblum, 52, is a professor in the Department of Psychiatry of
the State University of New York's Health Sciences Center in
Brooklyn. He is a founding member of the International Academy of
Sex Research.
   The two have collaborated, delivering papers at conferences and
editing a Kinsey Institute volume entitled,
``Masculinity-Feminity,'' published by the Oxford University Press
in 1987.
   Reinisch and Rosenblum, both divorced, have been engaged a long
time, according to Reinisch. ``But it has been kept quiet until
now.''
   She says Rosenblum's work occasionally brings him to the
Midwest. They both attend many of the same professional meetings,
and have the same book publisher in New York.
   ``But we hope someday to live in the same city,'' she said.

   Actor Kenneth Osmond, who played Eddie
Haskell on ``Leave It to Beaver,'' testified about the time he was
shot while working as a Los Angeles policeman.
   ``I saw a flash of light and the next thing I knew, I was flat
on my back on the sidewalk, 10 to 15 feet away. I was not able to
move. I thought I was dying,'' Osmond said Tuesday, recounting the
1980 shooting.
   The actor-turned-policeman-turned-actor testified in the penalty
phase of Albert Cunningham's murder trial. Cunningham, 41, faces
the death penalty for killing Enrique Treto, 36, on Dec. 2, 1985.
   Osmond was called to the stand to detail the lengthy criminal
record of Cunningham, who shot him three times eight years ago.
   The actor said that he and his partner were on motorcyle patrol
for drunken drivers when they came upon a stolen taxi driven by
Cunningham.
   Following a foot chase, Cunningham shot Osmond. A bulletproof
vest stopped two bullets and Osmond's belt buckle deflected the
third.
   Cunningham was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with police.
   Osmond testified that the shooting led to clinical depression,
ending his 14-year career as a police officer.
   The actor, known by generations of television viewers as Wally
Cleaver's wise-guy pal on ``Leave It to Beaver,'' reprises his
role, as a grown-up Eddie Haskell, on ``The New Leave It to
Beaver.''
   The show is videotaped at Universal Studios and shown on cable's
SuperStation TBS.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge's order to protect a
little-known species of woodpecker is at the heart of a tug-of-war
between environmentalists and loggers over clear-cutting in the
national forests of Texas.
   Naturalists estimate there are only about 180 to 190
red-cockaded woodpecker colonies left in Texas, with about two
birds to a colony, compared to the 500 or so needed to maintain a
viable population.
   At issue is U.S. District Judge Robert M. Parker's ruling that
seeks to protect the endangered bird by barring U.S. Forest Service
contractors from cutting down entire stands of trees within
three-fourths of a mile of a woodpecker colony, restricting the
harvest of trees near nests, and limiting the use of roads near
where the woodpeckers live or forage.
   Politicians have been quick to denounce the decision, saying the
restrictions could eliminate hundreds of jobs for truckers,
saw-millers and lumberjacks.
   Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, says he doesn't care if the
woodpecker becomes extinct. ``Humankind and the biological order
can get along just fine without this bird,'' he says.
   Environmentalists say the selective harvesting they advocate
would require more _ not fewer _ loggers than clear-cutting, which
is heavily mechanized.
   But Chapman says he is concerned that the Forest Service will
overreact and fail to harvest as much as it still can in the
Sabine, Davy Crockett, Angelina and Sam Houston National Forests.
   Forest Service spokesman Carl Gidlund said the judge's ruling
covers 473 miles of roads _ almost a fourth of the 2,000 total
miles of roads in the four East Texas forests.
   ``I'm encouraging them to cut in as close as they can, because
we're talking about jobs,'' says Chapman. ``By taking the
conservative approach, they're not selling the timber under the
court order I suspect they could sell.''
   Environmentalists contend that clear-cutting caused a
precipitous 10 percent drop in the bird's population over the past
five years, and said such timbering practices were violating the
Endangered Species Act.
   Parker in his June 17 ruling agreed and told the Forest Service
to alter its harvesting practices to ``uneven-age'' or ``selection
management.''
   Parker ordered the agency to file a plan to comply with his
order, but the Forest Service has responded by proposing a
compromise between clear-cutting and selection management that
environmentalists oppose. A Sept. 28 hearing is scheduled.
   Ned Fritz of the Texas Committee for Natural Resources accuses
the Forest Service of intransigence. ``They are sullenly refusing
to abide by the order of the court,'' he said.
   In selection management, only certain trees are removed at a
time so a perpetual forest is maintained, Fritz said, creating the
best habitat for the bird while also reducing the chances of insect
infestations. Additional jobs would be created because more
foresters are needed to keep track of what trees can be harvested,
he said.
   That argument fails to sway Chapman.
   ``The real argument is not over the woodpecker, but is basically
environmentalists disagreeing with clear-cutting. We're talking
about 500 woodpeckers. They're ugly, they don't have a particularly
melodious song, and they perform no useful service to either nature
or man,'' he said.
   Adds a spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas: ``Clearly, one
side is winning, and it seems to be the woodpecker.''
   Gramm, Chapman and other opponents of the judge's order also say
it will cost local counties money. A dozen counties in Texas
receive a fourth of the gross sales from timber harvested in
federal forests, with a total of $3.7 million last year going into
local school districts and county road and bridge funds, according
to Gramm's office.
   But Fritz, an attorney with the environmental group, said claims
that revenues will drop are smoke screens.
   ``The misrepresentations have gone wild,'' he said. ``Selection
management is more cost-effective and produces just as much if not
more timber and leaves the forest ever-better.''

<TEXT>
   The Boeing 727 is the backbone of many
airlines in the United States and abroad, and draws little but
accolades from aviation experts despite the crash of one of the
airliners at Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport.
   ``There is no more reliable plane in the world,'' says Gary
Reich, aerospace analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, the New York
investment firm. ``It has flown through storms and turbulence, and
it's performed beautifully and reliably.''
   ``They've been a highly reliable aircraft,'' says Roger Fleming,
technical chief for the Air Transport Association, the trade group
for the airline industry.
   The Boeing Co. manufactured 1,831 of the jets between 1962 and
1984, of which 1,770 are still in use worldwide, Boeing spokesman
Jack Gamble said Wednesday at company headquarters in Renton, Wash.
   Boeing estimates that 727s have flown 27.6 billion miles and
carried 3.1 billion passengers.
   It is the most commonly used plane in the U.S. commercial fleet.
According to airline consultant George James, of 3,476 passenger
and cargo aircraft used by American carriers, 1,148 are 727s. The
second most commonly used craft is the Boeing 737, with 634 in use.
   The Delta Air Lines 727-200 that crashed Wednesday at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport had made 38,629 takeoffs and landings,
Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said. Gamble said the plane's 44,000
hours of flight time were average for its age. It was built in 1973.
   Gamble said that since the first 727 went into service in 1964,
53 have been lost after accidents. That includes Wednesday's crash,
and four other 727s that have been destroyed in attacks by
terrorists or shot down.
   The aircraft's early years, however, revealed some problems that
had to be dealt with.
   Reich said that in the early years of the 727 _ when the
nation's airline fleets were just entering the jet age _ several of
the planes crashed because pilots were unaccustomed to the rapidity
with which the aircraft descended during landings.
   Pilots had to be retrained to cope with the so-called high sink
rate.
   In the course of those accidents, another problem came to light,
Reich said. In the early models, lines brought fuel along the top
of the fuselage from the wings to the three engines at the rear,
which meant that in accidents, coach passenges would be doused with
burning fuel. Within a few years, the lines were repositioned to
the bottom portion of the fuselage.
   ``They had some difficulties in the early years, but those go
back to the mid- to late '60s,'' said Fleming of the Air Transport
Association.
   Over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued
122 ``air worthiness directives'' ordering the owners of 727s to
make specific adjustments to the planes, said FAA spokesman Mitch
Barker in Seattle. He said that represents ``a normal number for an
aircraft that old.''
   Of those, however, only 12 applied to the model 200, the longer,
modernized version of the plane that Boeing began delivering to its
customers in December 1967. In all, 1,260 of the 727s manufactured
were model 200s, including the jet that crashed Wednesday. The
earlier versions were model 100s.
   One recurring problem was with the aircraft's landing gear,
which Barker said were complex and had been ``kind of a headache.''
He said he did not have details on what the problem was.
   Regarding the plane that crashed Wednesday, FAA records show a
wing flap control mechanism was replaced in July 1987 after an
aileron flap jammed on the right wing; and inspectors in August
1983 found two small cracks in the fuselage skin, measuring
one-half inch and three-quarters inch.
   FAA spokeswoman Bobbie Mardis described the problems as very
minor.
   Gamble said the first crash involving a 727 occurred in August
1965, when a United Airlines 727 plummeted into Lake Michigan. The
next involving a 727 was an American Airlines flight that crashed
in Cincinnati in November 1965, followed three days later by
another United accident at Salt Lake City. The Cincinnati and Salt
Lake City incidents were caused by the pilots' unfamiliarity with
aircraft's rapid rate of descent, he said.
   Among the craft's more recent accidents, a Pan American 727
crashed after takeoff in Kenner, La., on July 9, 1982, and 153
people were killed.
   The 727 is being phased out in favor of more economical planes
that use just two engines and require only two pilots.

<TEXT>
   When President Reagan hit Los
Angeles last week, he turned into something of a party animal.
   He and his wife, Nancy, more than ever before during their
traditional August visits to California, were out on the town.
   They attended private dinner parties nearly every night, whisked
by motorcade through dozens of traffic lights and their friends'
exclusive neighborhoods.
   In the shadow of Hollywood, the effort of moving the
presidential party safely about town was a production any film
director would envy.
   Weather permitting, Reagan usually takes helicopters in and out
of the city and his retreat at the Century Plaza Hotel. But for
short distances, he is moved by motorcade, in armored limousines
flown in from Washington just for his use.
   Arranging Reagan's motorcade calls for a cast of hundreds _
organizing to the minute the diverse movements of Los Angeles
police, the California Highway Patrol, Secret Service agents,
medical personnel, military aides, White House staff, reporters,
television crews, drivers and even helicopter pilots flying
overhead.
   For security purposes, the president's plans are never announced
in advance, nor is his route publicized.
   But when a string of nearly two-dozen vehicles whizzes by _
including police cars with flashing red lights, limousines flying
the American flag, Secret Service vans filled with flak-vested
agents, communications vehicles bristling with antennae, press vans
chock full of cameras and journalists, and staff cars, staff cars
and more staff cars _ it's easy to deduce that someone other than a
rock star is visiting town.
   One evening, residents of a swank Bel-Air street took a look at
their closed-off avenues and interpreted it as an open invitation
to start a block party.
   Their neighborhood had been swathed in enough yellow police tape
to wrap the national Christmas tree; and waves of agents in suits
and dark sunglasses had descended upon their walkways.
   So the locals broke out the Perrier and other stronger
substances to toast the president as his blocks-long motorcade sped
by.
   Entire families moved their patio and poolside furniture to
their front driveways, hobnobbing with reporters, waving a tiny
flag or two and sipping their drinks while waiting for a glance of
the president and first lady as they sped by.
   But even Los Angelinos can be blase about a president when a
real celebrity happens by. At one point, basketball star Magic
Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers was allowed to drive his black
Rolls-Royce convertible through the barricades, as local residents
who identify themselves are allowed to do.
   To the delight of more than one police officer and reporter,
Johnson paused to chat and sign a few autographs.
   But not all such innocent passers-by can be accorded similar
treatment, given the ever-present security concerns that bedevil
the organizers and protectors of the president.
   As Reagan's lengthy motorcade roared away from his hotel that
same evening, it appeared that one of the side streets had not been
blocked off by the motorcycle patrolmen.
   One motorist turned from the side street and started to drive
parallel to the end cars in the motorcade.
   As reporters in one of the last few vehicles spotted him, he
appeared blissfully unaware that he was accompanying the motorcade
and that Reagan's limousine was up ahead _ an easy mistake, given
that Reagan's vehicle was more than a dozen cars ahead and nearly
out of sight.
   Within seconds, agents in the motorcade became aware of the
outsider. One of the drivers in the staff cars swerved in front of
the interloper, attempting to cut the car off and keep it from
driving closer to the president's vehicle.
   Up ahead, one of the special Secret Service vans moved into the
same lane as the intruder. The tail-gate officer could be seen
taking aim with an automatic weapon.
   But by that time motorcycle officers had sped up to the hapless
driver, shouting at him to stop, which he did, apparently still
unaware he'd caused any disturbance.
   And the motorcade glided on.

   Farmers have aged so much in the tough times
of the 1980s that a former Agriculture Department economist says
retirements could force another round of farm consolidations by the
turn of the century.
   Matthew G. Smith, now with the Minnesota Department of Revenue,
says the graying of American farmers was a prominent issue in the
1950s and 1960s. But a boom in exports and farm incomes attracted
more young people in the middle and late 1970s and for a while the
face of agriculture got a bit younger.
   Now, however, ``nearly half of all farm assets are owned by
farmers who will probably retire within 10 years, yet fewer than
one in three younger operators is in a strong position to purchase
those assets,'' Smith said.
   ``With the number of new farmers again declining, with many
middle-aged farmers in financial difficulty, and with a steady rate
of retirement of older farmers, the total number of U.S. farms may
drop rapidly between now and the year 2000.''
   Smith reported his analysis in RDP, or Rural Development
Perspectives, a magazine published by the department's Economic
Research Service, where he formerly worked.
   ``If these trends continued unchecked, the share of farmland
owned by absentee landlords may rise, growth in farm efficiency may
slow, and businesses serving the farm sector will find themselves
competing for slices of a shrinking pie,'' he said.
   The net number of new farmers younger than 35 in 1974 averaged
almost 29,000 a year from 1974 to 1978, he said. From 1978 to 1982,
those who were under 35 in 1978 dropped by nearly 40 percent to
fewer than 18,000 a year.
   A middle group, 35 to 54 years, which grew from 1974 to 1978,
shrank in 1978-82. Thus, in this age group, which normally includes
farmers both entering and leaving farming, more were leaving than
entering by the early 1980s.
   ``Meanwhile rates of net departures among older operators (55
and older) were relatively stable, reflecting the fairly
predictable process of retirement,'' Smith said.
   Looking at the changes in the number of ``commercial-size''
farms, defined in the study as one with annual sales of $20,000 at
1982 prices, Smith said that these units increased from 865,000 in
1974 to about 942,000 in 1978, then declined to about 884,000 in
1982.
   Smith said that if the entry and exit rates remain at the
1978-82 levels, the number of commercial-size farms would decline
18 percent to about 727,000 units by 1998.
   But he said the rates won't be known for certain until next year
when the 1987 census of agriculture becomes available.
   ``Prospects appear dim that a sufficient number of young people
will begin farming to reverse the trend toward fewer
commercial-size farms,'' Smith said. ``With the farm baby boom
approaching 30, the numbers of farm-born youths at the prime entry
ages will now begin to decline.''
   Consequently, he said, the number of new farmers will continue
to drop, unless more farm children choose to remain on the land, or
more people from non-farm backgrounds take up farming.

   The Agriculture Department says drought
continues to put the bite on consumer food dollars, including
higher prices for fresh vegetables this summer and signs that
processed items also will be more costly next year.
   Prices paid to growers for fresh vegetables jumped more than 21
percent from July to August, officials said. And this summer's
prices, overall, could be up 10 percent from the third quarter of
1987, a period when fresh vegetable prices usually decline.
   ``However, this year's extremely dry weather, coupled with
minimum irrigation in the North Central states, reduced supplies
and put upward pressure on prices in midsummer,'' the department
Economic Research Service said Wednesday. ``As local supplies
tighten, consumers likely will be more dependent than usual on
vegetables shipped from more distant areas.''
   The government's Consumer Price Index, or CPI, for fresh
vegetables, including potatoes, rose 4 percent from June to July
and was up 5 percent from July 1987. Potatoes, lettuce and tomatoes
are the most important in the fresh vegetable index.
   Retail potato prices were up seasonally in July and were also
boosted slightly by the drought's impact on the summer crop.
   ``Lettuce prices tend to be seasonally low in July, and were
slightly lower this July due to large California supplies,'' the
report said. ``Tomato prices tend to be down in July, as tomatoes
are the most commonly grown vegetable in home gardens, which
reduces summer demand. However, the drought boosted this July's
prices.''
   The CPI for processing vegetables is generally flat in the
summer, but it rose 1 percent in July, the report said. Prices are
expected to continue rising through 1989 as higher wholesale costs
work through the marketing pipeline.

   Saudi Arabia has decided to cut spending on
domestic production subsidies for the 1989 wheat crop in an effort
to reduce the need for export subsidies, says an Agriculture
Department report.
   ``However, at this point the subsidy reduction will affect only
large farms, which account for about 10 percent of total Saudi
wheat production,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
reported Wednesday.
   The government of Saudi Arabia has been subsidizing exports of
domestic wheat surpluses since 1985-86. As a result, Saudi wheat
has competed against U.S. wheat in China, Indonesia and South
Korea, the report said.
   In addition to the wheat subsidy reduction, the Saudi government
will attempt to reduce the country's reliance on barley imports by
requiring large-scale wheat producers to plant as much barley as
they do wheat.

   New measurements have confirmed rapid growth
in the atmosphere of man-made bromine compounds from fire
extinguishers that scientists believe help destroy the earth's
protective ozone layer.
   Bromine has received much less attention than the
chlorofluorocarbon or CFC compounds in discussions of how to save
the stratospheric chemical layer that blocks the sun's
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   But bromine was covered by last year's treaty calling for a
halving of CFC production by 1998. Production of the fire-fighting
bromine compounds, called Halons, is to be frozen at 1986 levels in
1992.
   A chemical cousin of chlorine, bromine by itself can destroy
little ozone. But many chemists believe it amplifies the
ozone-destroying ability of chlorine liberated from both Halons and
the CFC compounds used as refrigeration fluids, solvents, foam
blowing agents and, outside the United States, as aerosol
propellants.
   Other compounds, some arising naturally from the ocean, are
important sources of atmospheric bromine. There is no consensus on
the importance of each source, and industry appears divided on the
importance of the new findings.
   The fire-fighting compounds are valuable because they snuff out
flames while leaving no residue that would disable valuable
equipment like computers. Only about 5 percent of emissions is
believed to come from actual fire-fighting, with most emissions
coming from equipment testing.
   Professional groups already have revised codes to eliminate
requirements that Halons be used to test equipment.
   The latest Halon measurements were made by a team of West German
and Indian scientists based at Germany's Max Planck Institute.
   In the Aug. 18 issue of Nature, the British scientific weekly,
the team reported atmospheric concentrations of the two main Halons
seem to be growing at 12 percent per year and 5 percent per year.
   The faster-growing compound is Halon 12, used in portable
extinguishers, whose concentration was measured in balloon flights
over France and India at 1.9 parts per trillion at 33,000 and
37,000 feet. The slower growth is for Halon 13, used in
room-flooding installations, whose concentration was about 1.3
parts per trillion.
   The major CFCs are present at a few hundred parts per trillion,
but the two bromine compounds are far more powerful _ three and 11
times as destructive of ozone than the most important CFC compound.
   The Halon 12 concentrations, when compared with measurements
made in 1982, 1983 and 1984, yield growth rates of 12 percent to 20
percent per year. The researchers said 12 percent ``seems to be the
more realistic.'' There have been no previous growth rates reported
for Halon 13.
   ``The measurements are in the range we have been considering in
our models,'' said Ross Salawitch, a postdoctoral researcher in the
Harvard University group headed by Michael McElroy studying bromine
reactions in the atmosphere.
   The McElroy group believes bromine is responsible for about 20
percent of the annual loss of ozone over Antarctica that produces
the well-known September ``hole'' which last year saw ozone
concentrations fall to 50 percent of normal.
   Some studies also show a small ozone loss over the Arctic.
   ``If there is any chemically driven ozone loss over the Arctic,
it is more likely to be driven by the chlorine-bromine reactions,''
Salawitch said.
   Three companies make Halon compounds in the United States: Du
Pont Co., ICI Americas and Great Lakes Chemical Corp.
   At Great Lakes in West Lafayette, Ind., Dave Bouchard, a
chemical engineer who is director of investor relations, said the
company was ``not confident at all'' that bromine enhances the
ability of chlorine to destroy ozone, and was sponsoring and
conducting research to try to prove or disprove it.
   At Du Pont, spokeswoman Cathy Forte said the Nature article was
``generally consistent with our understanding of the effects of
bromine in the atmosphere,'' and would not affect the company's
plans to end production of all its ozone-depleting products before
the turn of the century, including Halon compounds.
   The company has ended equipment testing with Halons, she said.
   Dan Dudek, an atmospheric scientist with the Environmental
Defense Fund, said he believed Halon production should be reduced
just like CFC production.

   The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News
are urging a federal judge to ignore ``Alice in Wonderland''
arguments and lift a court order blocking partial merger of the two
money-losing newspapers.
   A brief filed by the Free Press on Wednesday said opponents of
the joint operating agreement had mischaracterized the record in a
last-ditch attempt to forestall the partial merger.
   The brief was supported by the News and two unions, the
Newspaper Guild and Graphic Communications International Union.
   The newspapers rank in circulation among the 10 largest in the
nation.
   On Aug. 8, then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III approved the
combination of the newspapers' business and production operations.
The Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., and the News, owned by
Gannett Co. Inc., would retain separate news and editorial
departments.
   Meese approved the exemption to federal antitrust laws under the
Newspaper Preservation Act, which allows such exemptions when one
of the competing newspapers is in danger of failing.
   In winning a court-ordered delay in the merger, opponents argued
that the evidence showed the Free Press, far from failing, was a
healthy newspaper with some competitive advantages over the News.
   Attorneys for the Free Press, however, said, ``This `Alice in
Wonderland' assertion ignores over $80 million in operating losses
by the Free Press and $176 million in subsidies by its parent,
Knight-Ridder.''
   ``In the final analysis, plaintiffs' argument is that the owners
of the Free Press poured $176 million into the paper from 1977
through 1986 in an effort to generate artificial losses in the hope
that a JOA might some day be successfully negotiated,'' the brief
said. ``This proposition on its face is preposterous and
self-defeating.''
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green, at the request of a group
of Detroit advertisers and newspaper readers, issued an emergency
order Aug. 17 delaying the partial merger for a month. The order
came the day before the agreement was due to go into effect.
   The Free Press urged the court to deny the opponents' request
that the partial merger be blocked permanently and to force them to
pay court costs.
   The brief argued that the attorney general was correct in
overruling an administrative law judge's recommendation the
agreement be denied.
   ``The attorney general is the federal officer charged by
Congress with responsibility for applying and construing the
Newspaper Preservation Act,'' the brief said. ``It is the findings
and legal conclusions of the attorney general, not the
recommendations of the (administrative law judge) or the antitrust
division, to which the courts, therefore, defer.''
   The long and fierce circulation battle between the Free Press
and the News has kept advertising rates and newsstand prices lower
than in many large cities. The News has a newsstand price on
weekdays and Saturdays of 15 cents a copy in the Detroit area; the
Free Press sells for 20 cents.
   After the first five years of the 100-year agreement, the
newspapers would share profits or losses equally.
   The joint operating agreement would cause the loss of about 500
jobs, the newspapers have said. Should the agreement be blocked,
Knight-Ridder has said, the Free Press will be closed, with a loss
of 1,500 jobs.

<HEAD>Unions Applaud Ruling on Hospital Organizing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unions are getting a wider door from the
National Labor Relations Board to recruit millions of health care
workers in a move that hospitals contend can only increase medical
costs further.
   The NLRB told hospitals in a 153-page set of proposed
regulations published today they no long can try to lump nurses
with physicians or therapists and lab technicians with bookkeepers
or janitors as a tactic to keep unions from getting a foot in their
doors.
   Instead, the board said it will recognize eight broad categories
of hospital employees. If a union can win an election among workers
in any one category, the hospital will have to recognize it as the
collective bargaining agent for that specific group.
   NLRB officials said they hope to issue the regulations in their
final form before the end of this year _ after a wait of 45 days to
allow public comment on them.
   The board's past practice has been to rule case by case on what
is an appropriate bargaining unit each time a hospital and union
disagreed.
   Labor leaders contended, and NLRB officials agreed, that lengthy
hearings and appeals before the agency on each case hampered
unions' abilities to organize hospital workers.
   ``The practical effect was that if a union tried to organize
less than wall to wall, the employer would object and tie it up in
the NLRB,'' said David Silberman, associate general counsel for the
AFL-CIO. ``The larger the group, the harder it is to organize,
particularly when you have to cross different groups that have few
common concerns.''
   The regulations effectively reverse a 1984 board ruling allowing
for only three or four bargaining units at a hospital unless unions
could prove that the interests of different groups of workers were
so distinct as to justify more.
   At the same time, the board said it wanted to avoid a
congressionally prohibited ``proliferation'' of separate unions at
each hospital similar to the pattern of 10 to 15 different unions
faced by individual employers in the construction and newspaper
industries.
   ``If the unit is too large, it may be difficult to organize, and
when organized, will contain too diversified a constituency which
may generate conflicts of interest and dissatisfaction among fringe
groups, making it difficult for the union to represent,'' the board
said.
   ``On the other hand, if the unit is too small, it may be costly
for the employer to deal with because of repetitious bargaining,
frequent strikes, jurisdictional disputes and wage whipsawing,'' it
said.
   Since the 1984 ruling, the proportion of hospital workers
nationwide who belong to unions has dropped from 23 percent to 19
percent, according to the Service Employees International Union,
which represents some 300,000 health care workers.
   John Sweeney, the union's president, attributed a large part of
the decrease to ``delays caused by fighting over bargaining units.''
   ``I'm hopeful we'll see some significant gains,'' Sweeney said.
``Workers with a common interest now have an opportunity to decide
whether they want to organize or not.''
   The proposed regulations come at a time when the Labor
Department predicts that health care will be among the biggest
sources of new jobs in the 1990s as the nation grapples with an
aging population.
   Shortages of nurses already are plaguing many areas, and
physicians in the past three years have increasingly moved toward
forming unions of their own in response to corporate restructuring
of the industry.
   ``This is going to be expensive, disruptive and ultimately it is
going to increase the costs of health care,'' said Michael Anthony,
executive vice president of the American Hospital Association.
   Anthony said having to deal with as many as eight different
unions will reduce hospitals' ability to use ``team approaches and
flexibility to keep costs down.''
   The eight categories that the board listed as specific
bargaining units in hospitals are:
   Registered nurses; physicians; professionals except for nurses
and physicians; technical employees such as lab technicians;
skilled maintenance employees such as plumbers, electricians and
heating and air conditioning specialists; business office clerical
employees; guards; other non-professional employees.
   ``We feel this rule will finally stabilize this area of the
law,'' said NLRB Chairman James M. Stephens. ``We have attempted to
streamline the process by eliminating delays and protracted
hearings.''
   Excluded from coverage are nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals,
health maintenance organizations and other health care facilities
other than surgical and medical hospitals.
   Stephens was joined in approving the regulations by NLRB member
Mary Miller Cracraft. Dissenting was board member Wilford W.
Johansen, who said he still favors a case-by-case approach in
deciding the appropriate bargaining units.

   Questions about possible traffic jams,
air pollution and damage to sensitive plants are delaying approval
of plans for a library to house President Reagan's White House
papers.
   The Ventura County Environmental Report Review Commission
recessed a hearing on the project Wednesday without taking action
after concerns were raised by the California Department of Fish and
Game, the Sierra Club, the city of Thousand Oaks and others.
   The commission will meet again next week and could approve
construction of the library or order preparation of an
environmental impact report. That could take a year or more.
   The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, which has been
raising money for the library, hopes to break ground this fall and
complete construction in 1991.
   The facility, like the eight existing presidential libraries,
would be operated by the National Archives. In addition to housing
the Reagan papers for scholarly study, it would contain museum
exhibits about the president and his administration.
   Chuck Thomas, who represents Ventura County's air pollution
control agency on the seven-member technical commission, requested
the week's delay in order to get more information.
   If he had to vote on it without delay, he said, ``I think I
would have to come down against it.'' Thomas said the Air Pollution
Control District had found that the project would violate county
air quality standards because of the amount of automobile traffic
it would generate.
   Carroll McDonald, chairman of the Reagan Presidential Library
Committee of the Ventura-based organization Environmental
Coalition, told county officials that more than 425,000 people
annually are expected to visit the library, located northwest of
Los Angeles.
   ``Given the popularity of President Reagan, and the controversy
concerning portions of his presidency, it would seem reasonable to
assume that this will be a popular attraction for tourists as well
as a research library for historians,'' added Russ Baggerly,
representing a group called Citizen Interest in Ventura County.
   The library site, in a hilly area near the communities of
Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Moorpark, is served by a dusty road
used by jeeps and horses. To reach this road, however, traffic
would travel over a public road serving the three communities.
   Philip E. Gatch, director of planning and community development
for Thousand Oaks, said a portion of this road, approaching the
adjoining city limits of Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, ``remains a
two-lane roadway operating at a level of service beyond its current
capacity.''
   However, Frank W. Brutt, the planning and community development
director for Simi Valley, said the Simi Valley staff ``can make the
findings that the additional traffic that would be generated by the
library project would not have a significant impact on nearby
intersections under projected cumulative traffic conditions.''
   Fred Worthley, regional manager of the California Fish and Game
Department, said an undetermined number of three ``sensitive
plants'' would be uprooted or damaged by construction. In a letter
to county officials May 12, Worthley asked that the project be
redesigned to avoid the areas where the plants grow after a
detailed survey was made ``at the appropriate time of year when
these plants can be readily identified.''
   Cynthia Leake, conservation chairman of the Sierra Club chapter
in nearby Camarillo, asked that an environmental impact study be
made of both the effects on plant life and air quality.
   ``The size of the structure, the hours of operation, the
expected number of visitors per day all indicate serious
degradation of the air quality in the area,'' she said.
   The 153,000 square-foot library would operate from 9 a.m. to
4:45 p.m., seven days a week, and foundation officials say it is
expected to receive an average of 1,238 visitors per day.

<HEAD>Bush's Claims On Environment Bring Quick Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush touched off a quick
chorus of challenges and criticism from environmentalists and
elected officials with his claim to be a lifelong environmentalist.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis dismissed Bush's assertion on Wednesday
as ``an election-year conversion.''
   Sen. George Mitchell, a Maine Democrat who has pushed acid rain
legislation, asked where Bush was for the past seven years when the
Reagan administration slashed funding for water pollution and tried
to block renewal of the Clean Air Act.
   Blake Early, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said that if Bush
is an environmentalist, ``it comes as a revelation to us.''
   And Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, questioned the depth of Bush's ``sudden
commitment'' to the environment, saying ``He's still like the piano
player in the bordello who doesn't know what's going on upstairs.''
   Dingell, for his part, has been a leading opponent of
environmental legislation perceived as costly to the auto industry
in his home state. He has also fought acid rain legislation in
alliance with Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia,
a coal state.
   Bush, who planned to push the environmental theme again today by
taking a boat cruise of Boston Harbor, stood on the shore of Lake
Erie in Michigan on Wednesday and promised to take swift action on
acid rain if elected.
   The Republican presidential nominee also said he would convene a
global conference during his first year in the White House to
address the ``greenhouse'' effect. He called for wetlands
protection and pledged a policy of ``zero tolerance'' for toxic
polluters.
   But Bush, who aides said was trying to distinguish himself from
Reagan administration policies, may have touched off a backlash
that his campaign did not intend.
   In Boston, the Dukakis campaign moved quickly to help coordinate
a protest that would greet Bush on land, on the harbor and in the
air with demonstrations, boats and an airborne banner.
   Before leaving Massachusetts on Wednesday for a western campaign
swing, Dukakis defended his own record on Boston Harbor as governor
and criticized the Reagan administration for trying to eliminate
federal funding for sewage treatment plants.
   ``It's been polluted for hundreds of years, and I'm very proud
to be the governor's who's cleaning it up,'' Dukakis said. ``And we
are doing it no thanks to Vice President Bush and the
administration he is part of.''
   Earlier this summer, Dukakis broke ground for a cleanup project
for the harbor, but his critics complained he should have dealt
with the problem years ago.
   Dukakis was joined at a Statehouse press conference by Mitchell,
who was asked about Bush's promise to work with Congress on a ``set
timetable'' for reducing acid rain.
   ``My question is, where has the vice president been for the past
seven years?'' Mitchell asked, faulting the Reagan administration
for its ``outright opposition'' to his acid rain legislation.
   Dingell, an influential House Democrat, said Bush's stance was
``a welcome novelty coming from this administration'' that followed
``eight years of tranquil repose by Mr. Bush in the office of vice
president.''
   On Bush's acid rain commitment, Early said: ``Talk is cheap.''
He questioned what role Bush took in the early 1980s when the White
House blocked its own Environmental Protection Agency head from
seeking a 4 million ton reduction in pollutants blamed for acid
rain.
   In Boston, state Sen. William Golden, a Dukakis supporter who
has been prominent in the Boston Harbor cleanup effort, said he was
helping to coordinate the anti-Bush protest with local groups,
including the Audubon Society, Greenpeace, Clean Water Action, the
National Toxics Campaign and others.
   The first step was a press conference, where Mitchell faulted
the Reagan-Bush administration for trying to eliminate the federal
water pollution control program, twice vetoing the Clean Water Act,
trying to delay lead reduction in gasoline and favoring studies
over action on acid rain.
   ``For George Bush to come here and present himself as an
environmentalist, it's like Bonnie and Clyde coming out for gun
control,'' former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas told the press conference.

   Sen. Dan Quayle insists he can handle a
``fair play'' political contest and says the Democratic strategy of
portraying him as a liability for the Republicans means their
campaign is ``crumbling.''
   The Republican vice presidential nominee kicked off a Deep South
swing Wednesday, and for the first time in his 2-week-old campaign
found himself unhampered by reporters' questions about the National
Guard, his academic record or personal life.
   The new tone on the Quayle trail even led the nominee, who has
been demonstrably wary of the press since he became George Bush's
running mate, for the first time to walk back on his campaign plane
to meet the reporters covering him.
   Quayle travels today to Little Rock, Ark., where he is scheduled
to tour a Timex plant and a children's hospital, and to the
Jackson, Miss., area for a high school football practice and
fund-raiser.
   At stops Wednesday in Baton Rouge and Shreveport, Quayle blasted
Dukakis as a ``defeatist liberal'' who lacks the faith and
imagination to deal with unemployment and poverty in depressed
areas of the country.
   ``You know what the problem is with the man from Massachusetts?
It's that his ideas are as old as that 25-year-old snow blower he
keeps in his garage,'' Quayle told 4,000 students at Louisiana
State University.
   Quayle noted that unemployment was particularly high in
Louisiana because of the decline in the oil industry.
   ``We're not going to change that overnight, but for starters,
George Bush and I vigorously disagree with the man from
Massachusetts when he suggests that we cease offshore oil
exploration,'' Quayle said.
   The Dukakis campaign quickly reacted, with spokesman Leslie Dach
saying Quayle misstated the Massachusetts governor's position on
offshore drilling.
   ``Mike Dukakis supports offshore drilling when it's
environmentally sound and makes economic sense,'' he said.
``Offshore oil drilling makes sense in some parts of the country
but it should never happen in others.''
   Dach said he did not know what specific ``environmentally
sensitive'' areas Dukakis would consider off limits for drilling.
   As he toured an Exxon refinery, Quayle was asked about Dukakis
campaign manager Susan Estrich's comment Wednesday that Bush's
selection of Quayle will be a ``liability'' for Republicans that
the Democrats will exploit.
   ``This is the first real sign that you are seeing a crumbling
campaign,'' Quayle said. ``I've been in politics a long time. Fair
play. Fair enough. I can stand the heat and I'll stay in the
kitchen.''
   The LSU appearance was the nominee's first before a large
university crowd, a segment of the population Republicans are
hoping will provide a substantial bloc of votes this fall.
   Quayle said his main message for college students will be ``the
ideology of the campaign and the difference between a defeatist
liberal and an enlightened can-do conservative.''
   On his second campaign swing since being named Bush's running
mate, Quayle ran into no questions from the news media over whether
he pulled strings to get into the National Guard during the Vietnam
War and into law school after a mediocre college performance.
   Coverage of Quayle since his selection was the subject of a
study by the Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs,
which concluded he has been the subject of more negative reporting
than any other national candidate except Gary Hart.
   Evaluations of Quayle by reporters and non-partisan analysts
were positive only 33 percent of the time, according to the study
of the period from Aug. 16-28. The non-partisan researchers called
that ratio ``worse than any candidate received during the primaries
aside from Gary Hart's 21 percent positive rating.''

   Brown University on Wednesday named
Vartan Gregorian, head of the New York Public Library, to be the
16th president of the Ivy League college, the university chancellor
said.
   ``I come not to preside but to build,'' Gregorian said. ``The
institution is full of potential, full of greatness. Some of it has
been acheived, some of it still has to be achieved.''
   When asked at a news conference where he would like to see the
7,000-student university in five or 10 years, Gregorian replied,
``forward.''
   Gregorian's presidency was announced by Chancellor A.O. Way,
following a meeting of the Brown Corp., the university's governing
body.
   ``Vartan Gregorian comes to the presidency with superb
credentials as scholar and administrator,'' said Way, who was also
chairman of the selection committee. ``He has an uncommon degree of
energy and good humor, ingredients vital to all successful
presidencies.''
   Gregorian, 54, who was born to Armenian parents in Iran, went to
the New York library in 1981 from the University of Pennsylvania,
where he was provost. He used various fund-raising devices,
including society parties, to raise nearly $500 million during his
tenure.
   Gregorian admitted his fundraising ability did not hurt his
candidacy for the Brown position, but said his ``primary obligation
will be to the academic welfare of the institution _ if that
requires organization of fundraising'' so be it.
   Way's announcement concluded a nearly yearlong search, which
involved interviews with more than 200 candidates. Gregorian
replaces Howard R. Swearer, 56, who announced his resignation for
personal reasons last October after 11 years as Brown's president.

   A Delta Air Lines 727 jetliner burst
into flames as it crashed on takeoff Wednesday, killing 13 people.
But 94 survived as passengers, some cradling infants, scrambled out
of the shattered fuselage through ``a pit of fire.''
   By midnight, 15 hours after the crash in hazy sunshine at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, some uncertainty remained
about the number of victims.
   Although Delta officials released names of 94 survivors,
hospitals who treated victims counted at least 96 people. Five of
the names on the hospital lists were different from those released
by Delta and Delta officials offered no explanation for the
discrepancy. Delta also had three names of survivors who were not
included in lists from hospitals.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry in Atlanta said 13 fatalities were
confirmed, including an infant. All were from Texas, Delta said.
The count of victims was complicated by the difficulty in
determining how many babies were aboard, Berry said.
   Thirty-four survivors were hospitalized, Berry said. Survivors
included the captain and two other pilots, one of whom was working
as a flight engineer, he said.
   ``We were just terrified,'' said passenger Mona Thomason. ``We
jumped on the wing, but it looked like we were jumping into a pit
of fire.'' She reported seeing a woman with two children _ ``she
got one of them out, but I'm afraid the other one was caught in the
fire.''
   Investigators had no immediate indication of the cause of the
crash, said Michael Benson, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board in Washington.
   ``Apparently the pilot made an attempt to abort. ... There
apparently was an engine problem,'' Fred H. Rollins, Delta's
district manager for marketing in Salt Lake City, where the plane
was headed.
   Later Wednesday, other Delta spokesmen refused to discuss
potential causes of the crash, deferring all questions to federal
investigators, who had not held any briefings by midnight.
   A 16-member NTSB panel arrived late Wednesday from Washington to
bolster a three-person team from Fort Worth. Member Lee Dickinson
would not speculate on a cause, but said the team would remain at
the scene at least five to seven days.
   NTSB investigator Warren Wandel said the aircraft flight data
recorder and cockpit voice recorder, the so-called ``black boxes,''
were found in good shape.
   The recorders were being taken to Washington for examination in
an NTSB laboratory, Dickinson said at a briefing Wednesday night.
   Spokesmen for Boeing and for Pratt & Whitney, the manufacturer
of the plane's three engines, said they would also send
investigators.
   Fire and rescue crews quickly reached the wreckage in a level
field about 1,000 feet beyond the end of the runway. It was at the
opposite end of the airport from the site of the crash of a Delta
Lockheed L-1011 on Aug. 2, 1985, in which 137 people died.
   ``We didn't make it 50 feet in the air. We skidded and then the
engine exploded,'' said passenger Jim Hammock of Garland. ``There
was pandemonium. People were jumping on the plane's wing and
burning themselves on it because it was so red hot. We got out of
the way fast because we thought it was going to explode.
   ``You could see the fuel running down the window and down the
wing, and I wasn't going to get burned,'' said Hammock, whose right
sleeve was streaked with jet fuel.
   Penn Waugh, a Dallas attorney who was on the flight, told
reporters the plane ``never got in the air.''
   ``You heard the thing crumple so you knew you were going to
crash the whole time,'' said Waugh, who was uninjured. ``You were
just looking for a way to get out of the plane. You're hoping you
weren't going to die.''
   Most of those hospitalized suffered burns, cuts or broken bones.
Bill Whitman, a spokesman for Harris Methodist-H.E.B. Hospital in
Bedford, said 64 survivors were brought to the hospital, of whom 19
were admitted.
   All those admitted were in satisfactory to stable condition, and
the most serious cases involved smoke inhalation, Whitman said.
   Flight 1141 originated in Jackson, Miss., and was taking off for
Salt Lake City when it went down at 9:03 a.m.
   It carried a crew of seven, including two flight attendants who
were among those killed, Delta said. Spokesman Henry Conley said a
total of 23 Delta employees were on board, and 10 flight attendants
were traveling as passengers, five of those heading for a training
session.
   Asked if the presence of so many flight attendants could have
contributed to the high number of survivors, he said, ``It's a very
good possibility, but I'm not sure at this time.''
   FAA spokeswoman Bobbie Mardis in Oklahoma City said details of
crew experience were not immediately available, but none of the
three pilots had had an accident, incident or violation in their
records.
   The burned-out hull, missing much of its roof and broken open
just ahead of the tail, smoldered among sunflowers, prairie grass
and scattered pieces of luggage. One of the plane's three engines
stood upright about 60 yards from the main wreckage, and the acrid
smell of jet fuel and burned plastic lingered long after the fire
was out.
   David Aguilar, the U.S. Border Patrol agent in charge at Dallas,
used a drug- and body-sniffing dog named Bruno to probe the
wreckage for bodies. Bruno was used in Brownsville to hunt for
victims after a department store roof collapsed July 7, killing 14
people.
   Boeing spokesman David Jimenez said the 727-200 had made 38,629
takeoffs and landings. Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the
plane's 44,000 hours of flight time was average for its age.
   Maintenance records indicated the plane, built in 1973, had only
``very minor'' problems in the last five years, Ms. Mardis said.
   Delta, following industry practice, will suspend its advertising
for a few days, Berry said.
   Ron Anderson, director of Parkland Memorial Hospital where at
least a half-dozen people were treated, said the captain, Larry
Davis of Greenville, was able to talk but in shock.
   Davis had been pinned in the wreckage, Anderson said.
   ``He had a series of traumatic injuries,'' Anderson said. ``We
do not know yet how much of that is internal.''
   Passenger Dan Walker, 40, a Dallas veterinarian, credited the
pilot with a remarkable feat getting the plane down.
   ``We got airborne about 300 feet and then we got in trouble and
the pilot did an excellent job of getting us flat,'' he said. ``All
he did was save a few hundred lives.''
   ``We veered to the right as we were taking off,'' said Peter
Wright, a passenger from Dallas. ``I heard a banging noise under
the carriage and then someone said, `We're not going to make it,'''
said Wright, who slightly injured his wrist.
   ``We didn't get 10 feet off the ground when we seemed to lose
power,'' said Geoff Parkes, Wright's traveling companion. ``I saw
the right wing tip hit the ground and flames shot toward my
window.''
   Gene Metzig of Wichita Falls saw the accident from an ASA
commuter flight that had just arrived from Wichita Falls and was
sitting on a connecting runway.
   ``His right wing was coming straight at us. It was probably no
more than a foot or 18 inches off the ground. As he pulled it back
to the left, I don't know how the hell he missed us, but he missed
us,'' Metzig said.
   Metzig said the ASA passengers ``were cheering this guy to get
that plane off the ground. ... We were rooting for that pilot to
get that plane up. But there was just no way.''

   Mason, star of the Broadway show ``The World According to Me,''
is scheduled to sing as cantor at services Sept. 11 for the first
night of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, at Congregation Ansche
Chesed on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
   Mason, an ordained rabbi, offered to serve as cantor to help
raise money to renovate the 60-year-old synagogue, according to
Ansche Chesed program director Sarah Jacobs.
   Tickets to High Holy Day services are sold to non-members, and
it is hoped Mason will be an attraction, she said.

   Lorimar Production's lawsuit against actress
Valerie Harper has been trimmed by a judge who said he saw no
evidence that would allow the company to seek punitive damages from
her.
   Judge William Hogoboom, the retired Superior Court jurist who is
hearing the case, said Wednesday he was dismissing Lorimar's
allegations that Miss Harper had committed fraud, bad-faith denial
of an existing contract, and inducement by her husband, Tony
Cacciotti, to breach their contract.
   Left intact by Hogoboom was Lorimar's breach of contract
challenge against Miss Harper.
   The actress and the production company are suing each other over
Miss Harper's dismissal one year ago from the television show

   A Milan attorney earlier this month filed a complaint asking
that the showing of the U.S. director's film be blocked under
Italy's laws against obscenity and blasphemy.
   If the prosecutors who watched the film Wednesday determine that
it may violate those laws, they can open a formal investigation.

   Federal regulators are continuing a rapid pace
of savings and loan rescues by pledging $1.9 billion to restore 14
failing institutions in Oklahoma to solvency.
   Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said
Wednesday his agency would merge the 14 S&Ls into six larger
institutions and begin efforts to sell them to private buyers with
a meeting today with Oklahoma investors.
   Through the sales, the agency hopes to get back some of its
assistance, which includes $1.2 billion in 10-year promissory notes
and $700 million in guarantees against future losses.
   In just two weeks, the agency has pledged nearly $10 billion to
rescue, in addition to the Oklahoma institutions, 21 in Texas, five
in Minnesota and one each in Iowa, Idaho, California and Tennessee.
   Wall indicated the fast pace will continue over the next month.
   ``We will be very active,'' he said.
   He declined to provide details, but the agency's spokesman, Karl
Hoyle, said pending transactions in Texas and other states would
involve billions of dollars more. The problem is greatest in the
Southwest, which has been hard hit by problems in the oil industry.
   In part, the agency, which got a new board and an infusion of
cash last summer, is merely ``hitting its stride,'' Wall said, but
he acknowledged that the board felt pressured to act quickly by a
pending change in the way the federal budget deficit is calculated.
   Although the bank board receives its money through an assessment
on the industry and not from the taxpayers, its spending counts
toward the deficit.
   Effective at the start of the 1989 fiscal year on Oct. 1,
government accountants will count the bank board's promissory notes
as immediate spending. Thus, any notes issued before Oct. 1 greatly
ease the administration's budget-balancing burden.
   The bank board was facing a deadline today to wrap up
negotiations with the Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas,
which is seeking federal assistance to acquire American Savings and
Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., one of the nation's largest
S&Ls.
   The board began negotiating with the Bass Group exclusively on
April 21 and twice has extended the deadline. Wall promised an
announcement on American today but would not say whether the board
had struck a deal or was planning to continue negotiations.
   Industry sources have said between $1.5 billion and $2 billion
in federal money likely will be required for that rescue, which
would make it the largest bailout of a single S&L.
   Including the Oklahoma package, regulators have closed or merged
94 S&Ls so far this year, compared with 48 for all of last year.
Wall said he planned to resolve the cases of 259 institutions this
year and next.
   Wall said three of Oklahoma's 48 S&Ls are attempting to
restructure themselves with private capital, rather than government
help, but if those efforts fail, they will be added to the
consolidation plan. The state's remaining 31 institutions are
healthy, he said.
   Politicians and industry officials in Oklahoma are complaining
that the consolidation will make it difficult to keep the
institutions in the hands of state residents.
   ``If they lump them all into several huge packages, it's likely
they'll be sold to out-of-state investors because we're a
capital-poor state,'' said Michael L. Toalson, president of the
Oklahoma League of Savings Institutions.
   Oklahoma congressional offices made telephone calls Wednesday
morning in an attempt to persuade the bank board to delay its
announcement until after Congress returns from its Labor Day recess.
   Joe Taylor, an aide to Rep. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said Inhofe and
other Oklahoma members of Congress wanted a greater say in shaping
the plan.
   ``We're concerned, very concerned, about the timing of this
thing,'' he said.
   The chairman rejected that criticism, saying, ``Every day we
wait ... the problem gets bigger. Our intention is to move as
expeditiously as possible.''
   The 14 institutions in Oklahoma are Capital Federal Savings
Bank, Oklahoma City; Mutual Federal Savings and Loan Association of
Oklahoma City; First Oklahoma Savings Bank, Tulsa; MidAmerica
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Tulsa; Kingfisher Federal
Savings and Loan Association, Kingfisher; Sunbelt Savings, Oklahoma
City; Frontier Federal Savings and Loan Association, Ponca City;
Home Savings and Loan Association, Bartlesville; Phoenix Federal
Savings and Loan Association, Muskogee; Cimarron Federal Savings
and Loan Association, Muskogee; First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Elk City; Heritage Savings and Loan Association of
Elk City; Home Savings Bank, Lawton, and Peoples Federal Savings
and Loan Association, Ardmore.

   The pullout of South African troops from
Angola should increase the prospects for peace talks in the region,
U.S. officials say.
   ``This is a significant milestone in the process of achieving a
peaceful solution to the conflict in southwestern Africa,'' State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Wednesday.
   U.S.-mediated negotiations on further steps in the peace process
between South Africa, Angola and Cuba will resume next week in the
Congo capital of Brazzaville, Mrs. Oakley said.
   The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported today that Cuba held
secret talks last weekend with the U.S.-backed UNITA rebels in
Angola.
   U.S. officials whom the Post did not identify said they did not
know whether the talks were an indication that Cuban President
Fidel Castro was seeking a reconciliation agreement between the
Cuban-backed Angolan government and UNITA.
   It was not immediately known whether Angolan officials were
aware of the talks, which the Post said took place in the Ivory
Coast capital of Abidjan between UNITA and a Cuban delegation
headed by Cuba's ambassador to the United Nations, Oscar Oramas.
   The U.S.-mediated talks between South Africa, Angola and Cuba,
which were suspended last week for consultations by the parties
with their governments, are aimed partly at achieving agreement on
a timetable for the pullout of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops
from Angola.
   The last contingent of South African soldiers, who supported
Angola's anti-Marxist guerrillas, crossed into South-West Africa on
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Reagan Agrees to 4.1 Percent Federal Pay Hike, Cites Improved
Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says he'll go
along with Congress and grant most federal workers a 4.1 percent
pay increase next year, more than double the amount he had sought.
   Reagan, in a letter to congressional leaders Wednesday, said
improving economic conditions made possible the 4.1 percent
increase, although it earlier had appeared the government would be
able to afford only 2 percent.
   The raise, contained in a bill already passed by Congress but
which has not yet reached Reagan's desk, will go to federal workers
now earning between $10,000 and $75,500 per year, and will take
effect in their first pay period of the new calendar year.
   Reagan expressed regret that a House-Senate conference committee
on appropriations did not extend the pay raises to higher-paid
federal employees, since they are the ones who lag most seriously
behind private-sector pay.
   He said he would recommend increases for them in the final
budget message that he will send to Congress before leaving office
on Jan. 20.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with the vacationing
president in California, said he did not know how much the pay
increases would cost or how many employees would be covered.
   Reagan noted the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay had told him
that increases in pay averaging 26.28 percent, effective in
October, would be necessary to make federal pay comparable with
that in private employment.
   Fitzwater said this calculation did not take account of employee
benefits, which often are higher for government workers than for
those in private industry.
   ``We had earlier assumed, for budget plannning purposes, that
economic conditions would only permit a 2 percent pay increase this
year,'' Reagan wrote leaders of the House and Senate.
   ``However, as the revitalization of the nation's economy has
continued on the course this administratiofn has set, we have seen
unemployment drop, and free market forces have resulted in rising
pay rates for American workers, particularly in shortage
occupations. The federal government, as an employer, must compete
like any other employer in the labor market for the skilled workers
it needs.''
   The president said it was clear that economic conditions would
not permit a pay increase of 26.28 percent, but would permit the
smaller increase ``to ensure the continued quality of our nation's
civil service.''
   The president is required to make the pay determination annually
under a federal law passed in 1970.

<HEAD>`Voodoo' Mayor Ousted in Impeachment Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLORALA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florala's 85-year-old mayor was ``hurt very
much'' by a jury's swift decision to remove him from office for
pardoning drunken drivers and embarrassing the town with ``voodoo''
pranks, his lawyer says.
   Former Mayor H.T. Mathis ran out of the Covington County
Courthouse without commenting on the jury's impeachment verdict
Wednesday, reached after one hour of deliberations following a
three-day trial.
   City Councilman Jack Inabinett immediately assumed mayoral
duties, and said he was conferring with the state attorney
general's office about selecting Mathis' permanent successor.
   Mathis, a first-term mayor, got national publicity for
sprinkling ``voodoo powder'' around City Hall and later holding a
midnight news conference to proclaim ``National Voodoo Week.''
   He was accused of turning Florala into a national laughingstock
because of the voodoo pranks and undermining the town's legal
process by pardoning convicted drunken drivers, many of them more
than once.
   James Prestwood, Mathis' attorney, said he would seek a new
trial for the mayor, who testified in circuit court that he
pardoned dozens of convicted offenders because he's ``soft
hearted.''
   ``He was hurt very much by the verdict,'' Prestwood said.
   But City Clerk Betty Hooten, who testified for the prosecution,
said the town of 5,000 near the Florida border was now ready to
pull together and get the ``bad publicity'' behind them.
   The jury ruled that Mathis should be removed from office on
grounds of incompetence and neglect of duty. Circuit Judge William
Baldwin said Mathis was immediately ousted from office with the
verdict.
   Mathis was elected in 1984 to a term that expires Oct. 3.
However, municipal elections in Florala have been postponed by a
federal court because of a voting-rights lawsuit, and Mathis might
have remained in office indefinitely had he not been impeached.
   Alabama has no recall provision, so an impeachment trial is the
only way to remove a public official. They are civil proceedings
conducted in state courts, but the defendant can request a jury.
Officials who are found guilty of impeachment are only removed from
office, not fined or sent to jail.

<TEXT>
   Lines are legendary in Moscow, so it's no
surprise that the lunchtime queue snakes for 90 minutes most days
at Cafe Kropotkinskya No. 36.
   What's unusual is that this restaurant does not belong to the
state, but to a cooperative founded by Andrei Fyodorov, who has
come here to whet the appetites of U.S. businessmen for the Soviet
Union's experiments in private enterprise.
   He is the guest of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc., and is
promoting his country as open as the Wild West once was.
   ``Today the Russian market should be of great interest to
Americans,'' Fyodorov, who also is general secretary of the
Committee for Cooperative Business in Moscow, said recently through
a translator. ``The U.S.S.R. now has limitless opportunities.''
   Seagrams invited Fyodorov and his wife, Helen, because the
Soviet Union ``is a good market for our products,'' some of which
already are sold in that country, said Robert I. Gandel, vice
president for special projects for Seagrams Overseas Sales Co.
   Fyodorov, who worked many years for the Soviet tourist agency,
expects to learn much about restaurants and to impart a good
feeling for doing business with Soviet cooperatives of all kinds.
Seagrams hopes he will go home with ``an understanding of the way
the restaurant business is run, and the importance of wines and
spirits in the hospitality business,'' Gandel said.
   Toward those ends, Fyodorov's schedule in the United States
included visits with chefs and meals at New York's toniest
restaurants. Also planned were visits to a supermarket and farmers'
market, a winery tour, a New York power breakfast and a night at
Rockefeller Center's Rainbow Room.
   Philadelphia and Washington were also on the itinerary before
the Fyodorovs return to Moscow on Monday.
   Gandel said Americans who have eaten at Soviet-run restaurants
would be surprised by Cafe Kropotkinskya's food and friendly,
professional service.
   At a state restaurant, Gandel said, there might be lipstick on a
glass, or a 90-minute wait to be acknowledged by a waiter.
   At Cafe Kropotkinskya, which seats 200, ``it is far from perfect
in service, but the desire is there and eventually the tree will
bear fruit,'' said Fyodorov, who watches over every detail and
planned to make sure by telephone that all was well in his absence.
   In March 1987, Cafe Kropotkinskya No. 36, named for its street
address, became the first of an estimated 300 cooperative
restaurants in Moscow.
   It was an instant hit, and now would-be diners without luncheon
reservations wait in line outside the 19th-century townhouse 1{
hours most days. At night, don't even bother to come by without a
reservation, Fyodorov said.
   Is it the food?
   ``No,'' said Fyorodov, talking amid the quiet elegance of
Aurora, a midtown Manhattan restaurant where a reception was held
to mark the start of his tour.
   ``It's paradoxical. The first three days the food was good,'' he
said. ``But constant lines make it impossible to work. The constant
pressure. It's a factory.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has said he is depending on
cooperatives, organized under a series of recent laws, to provide
consumer goods and services the inefficient state-run economy
cannot.
   But the lines and the high price of a meal, as much as two days'
pay, has led to allegations that the new restaurants, motivated by
profit, cater to foreigners and privileged Soviets.
   One Moscow street cartoon showed a naked man holding his
briefcase strategically and standing at his door, opened by his
shocked wife. ``I just ate at the cooperative restaurant,'' he
explains.
   Such a reputation is a problem, Fyodorov acknowledged. But he
argued that Soviets can afford to eat in his restaurant, if only
for special occasions, and that no one would complain if a family
reserved a table and ordered just ``four coffees and a couple of
appetizers.''
   Still, Fyodorov said he has no plans to lower prices ``as long
as the restaurant is full. Only the market could lower prices.''
   There is some justification. Cooperative employees are better
paid than people doing similar jobs for the state, he said. And to
get fresh produce and meat, Fyodorov said he usually pays three
times the normal cost, and in cash.
   His fish, he said, is ``alive and kicking,'' when he gets it. Of
his veal, he boasted, ``Two hours ago it was alive.''
   Some cooperatives now have been given permission to deal in
foreign currencies, which unlike rubles, are good on world markets.
But enabling U.S. entrepreneurs to make a profit in the Soviet
Union remains an obstacle, though Fyodorov said, ``It only takes
desire from both ends. We are prepared to open opportunities to
American entrepreneurs.''
   ``Everyone wants to eat and everyone is willing to pay for it.
We will find a way to divide up the money.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Educators were attacked for teaching such
diverse subjects as birth control and the horror stories of author
Stephen King as ``far right'' groups last year continued to try to
censor school curricula, a liberal advocacy group says.
   People for the American Way said Wednesday it counted 157
incidents of ``extremist pressure on school systems or outright
censorship challenges in the 1987-88 school year.''
   The civil liberties group said an ``alarming trend is that
national and local pressure groups have adopted mainstream tactics.
... They have lobbied state legislatures on curriculum guidelines
and pressured textbook selection committees to reject books and
programs that fail to pass their narrow, sectarian litmus test,''
said Arthur J. Kropp, president of the 270,000-member organization.
   Rebecca Hageline, director of communications for one group
targeted in the report _ Concerned Women for America _ said it was
typical of People for the American Way's ``religious bigotry toward
conservative Christians.''
   ``Parents have a right to have input into their children's
education,'' she said.
   The report said Concerned Women for America presented the
Barlow, Fla., school board with 4,456 petition signatures opposing
teaching about contraception in sex education courses. The board
agreed the courses should stress abstinence and not mention
contraception, the report said.
   Among the 157 incidents People for the American Way said it
found was a dispute in Panama City, Fla., where a school board said
60 books could not be used on a junior high supplementary reading
list without its approval.
   The policy later was reversed, but the report said two books,
Robert Cormier's ``I am the cheese'' and Farley Mowat's ``Never Cry
Wolf,'' remain banned, and a lawsuit is pending.
   People for the American Way said the most frequently challenged
authors were Judy Blume and John Steinbeck (in seven cases each),
King (four) and Cormier and J.D. Salinger (both three). Steinbeck's
novel ``Of Mice and Men'' was the book most often singled out.
   In Parker, Colo., Patricia Hermes' novel ``A Solitary Secret''
about a 14-year-old girl's experience with incest was removed from
the junior high to the high school library after a parent's
complaint.
   In Crown King, Ariz., a teacher renamed her 666 Reading Club
after parents and school board members objected that the number was
a biblical sign for the devil. The teacher, who had picked it as
the goal for how many pages students should read each month,
renamed it the 667 Reading Club.
   In Arlington, Texas, in a high school production of ``A Chorus
Line,'' a homosexual character was changed to a victim of child
abuse and references to sex were deleted.
   In Las Cruces, N.M., parents and conservative activists objected
to Halloween activities in several elementary schools, as well as
Maurice Sendak's ``Where the Wild Things Are.'' The school district
modified the activities, but kept the book.
   Not all of the so-called censorship incidents came from the
conservative end of the political spectrum.
   PAW's list of incidents include a ban on in-school meetings of
the Teens for Christ Club at the high school in West Fork, Ark.,
after the American Civil Liberties Union threatened a lawsuit.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa walked with
a bounce in his step as he left his house for his first meeting
with senior officials of the communist government in more than six
years.
   Not only did his long-sought goal for talks with the government
come true Wednesday, but it came on the anniversary of his greatest
triumph _ the signing of the 1980 accords that legalized the Soviet
bloc's first independent union federation.
   For the 44-year-old shipyard electrician who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1983, it was a testament to his unswerving determination
not to give up on his vision of workers' solidarity.
   Walesa's vision was born in the December 1970 food price riots
in which dozens of workers were killed by security forces along the
Baltic coast.
   He was one of the workers who met later with the new Communist
Party first secretary, Edward Gierek. Gierek calmed the protest
with promises to improve national leadership and inspired workers
to chant: ``We will help! We will help!''
   But workers rose again in 1976 in a revolt brutally put down by
authorities, and Walesa and a handful of associates began
organizing illegal free trade unions along the coast.
   When new price increases raised tensions in 1980, it was Walesa
who returned to lead the fight. In two weeks that saw strikes
spread nationwide, he wrested from the government 22 concessions on
social and trade union issues, the most important guaranteeing the
right to independent self-governing trade unions.
   The accords were signed in the shipyard by Walesa and
then-Deputy Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Jagielski on Aug. 31, 1980,
and Solidarity was born.
   The triumph gave way to a euphoric but chaotic period that
lasted 15{ months before Polish authorities accused the union of
leading the country to anarchy, imposed martial law and locked up
Walesa and thousands of his followers on Dec. 13, 1981.
   Walesa was interned in a series of luxurious government homes
until Nov. 13, 1982. While locked up, he was approached by various
high officials in a bid to persuade him to endorse the government's
emergency actions. He refused.
   Solidarity was suspended and outlawed in October 1982. After
Walesa's release from internment, authorities did all in their
power to make him a non-person.
   His photo and name rarely appeared in newspapers and never in a
positive light. He was called a tool of foreign powers and the
``former head of a former union.'' One rather crude media campaign
accused him of embezzling union funds.
   But Walesa continued leading the shellshocked remnants of the
Solidarity movement.
   After martial law was lifted in July 1983 and most political
prisoners were released in late 1986, Solidarity began to function
more and more openly.
   Walesa consolidated its leadership last year into a national
executive commission with representatives from every region and
with himself as chairman.
   When strikes broke out on April 25, Walesa joined a walkout in
the shipyard despite his sense that the country wasn't ready. He
showed he still had the common touch, comforting and inspiring
young strikers half his age who sometimes lined up for his
autograph.
   The shipyard strike ended inconclusively May 10, but Walesa
vowed that next time it would be better prepared. The latest round
of strikes, which began Aug. 16, showed a high degree of
organization. Advisers fanned out around the country and a national
information network was set up.
   The strikes, at last, also resulted in an invitation from the
government to talk to Walesa, who just moved into a new house with
his wife, Danuta, and eight children.
   Lt. Colonel Wieslaw Gornicki, an aide to Polish leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, said Walesa was invited as an ``eminent
personality,'' not as ``the chairman of a non-existent union.''
   Still, it was significant that the government chose Walesa to
try to open a dialogue that could help lead the country out of
economic despondency.
   Piotr Konopka, a Walesa aide and adviser in Gdansk, savored the
moment while Walesa talked with Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak
and alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek.
   ``This union managed to survive, managed not to lose its
authority, managed to keep its leader, who today begins again to be
a partner for talks, a very necessary partner as it turned out,''
he said.

   Police used a battering ram late Wednesday to
crash into a home where a 65-year-old woman was believed barricaded
during a three-day standoff in which the police chief's brother was
wounded.
   Officers battered the house around 10:30 p.m, said Officer Ken
Axelrad. However, police did not immediately apprehend the woman,
he said.
   Capt. Stephen Gates, 51, brother of Police Chief Daryl Gates,
was in good condition at Daniel Freeman Hospital with a graze wound
to the head, said Detective Robert Iannessa.
   The unidentified woman allegedly fired through her window at
Gates as he attempted to talk her into coming out of the house
Wednesday, Iannessa said. A police officer was also fired on around
9:45 p.m. but was not hit, the detective said.
   Negotiators tried to reach the woman by telephone, but Iannessa
said, ``She's not talking to anybody.''
   The tank-like battering ram usually is reserved for cracking
fortified ``rock houses'' used in drug sales.
   The standoff began at 1 p.m. Monday when the woman threatened
her daughter with a gun, authorities said. The woman was believed
to be alone in the house where there were several weapons, her
husband told police.

   The Mexican Newspaper Editors Association on
Wednesday criticized a new law in Tamaulipas state that calls for
jury trials in cases involving ``crimes committed by the media
against the public order and security of the state.''
   The Federal Code already lists these crimes, but the new state
law subjects defendants to jury trial when committed by ``the
press.''
   The Association voiced its opposition to the law on the last day
an annual convention being held in Mexico City with the National
Association of Hispanic Publications of the United States.
   The Mexican association boasts 72 newspaper affiliates.
   The law calls for potential jurors to be selected by municipal
mayors to hear accusations against the media.
   Association president Jose Martinez Bastida said the law
``violates constitutional guarantees and constitutes an attempt
against freedom of expression and the right to information.''
   Luis Villareal Marroquin, director of the newspaper Diario in
Nuevo Laredo, received the association's Jose Vansconcelos award
for his efforts to stop enactment of the state law.

   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leader of a
democratic reform movement, on Wednesday urged the ruling party to
negotiate publicly with the opposition over disputed returns from
1,000 polling places.
   He called on the ruling party's presidential candidate, Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, to personally undertake negotiations that would
``open wider spaces'' for democracy in Mexico.
   According to official returns, Salinas beat Cardenas in the July
6 general election with 50.36 percent of the vote.
   Cardenas and his leftist coalition said the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, cheated to maintain the power it has
held since 1929. The rightist opposition has leveled the same
charge.
   Before a crowd of about 10,000 gathered in a steady drizzle at
the Revolution Monument, Cardenas rejected an offer from the ruling
party Sunday for a dialogue with the opposition about future
political reform. The question of fraud must first be cleared up,
he insisted.
   ``To negotiate in any other terms would mean, for us, to break
our promise to the people,'' he said.
   Cardenas said his leftist coalition was cheated out of nine
Senate seats and at least 40 seats in the 500-person Chamber of
Deputies. Official, but disputed returns, give Cardenas' coalition
four Senate seats, the first the PRI has ever relinquished, and 139
in the chamber.
   On Tuesday, President Miguel de la Madrid warned the opposition
that the PRI will not give up power.

   A vote watchdog group on Wednesday reiterated
its charges the July 6 presidential election and the just-concluded
work of the Electoral College to constitute the Chamber of Deputies
were tainted by fraud.
   The Democratic Assembly for Effective Suffrage said that under
such conditions, the Chamber's work to certify the election of
Carlos Salinas de Gortari as president will be marred as well.
   ``Neither the Federal Election Commission nor the Electoral
Colleges of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate fulfilled their
mission: to clean the electoral process,'' an Assembly statement
said.
   ``If the Chamber applies to the presidential qualification the
same arbitrary and injust procedures it used to constitute itself,
it will transmit its own illegitimacy to the head of the
executive,'' it said.
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, presidential candidate of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, received 50.36 percent of the
vote according to official results. The Chamber of Deputies must
approve his election before inauguration day, Dec. 1.

   The Commerce Department has authorized the
completion of all debt-for-equity swaps suspended in October 1987,
but does not plan to renew the swap program.
   Between $500 million and $600 million in authorized swap
transactions were frozen when the government called off the program
last year, according to the government newspaper El Nacional.
   The Commerce Department said the swaps were inflationary in
suspending the program. It had approved more than $2 billion worth
of swaps in the two years that the program was in effect.
   This week the department said all outstanding swaps would be
completed before President Miguel de la Madrid leaves office Nov.
30.
   Under the program, foreign investors cash in Mexican foreign
debt paper with the government, which issues peso equity for
investment purposes in Mexico.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen's blind trust has invested more than twice the amount
previously disclosed in a holding company his son formed last year,
and the company has been paying his son almost $10,000 a month as
its president and board chairman, according to a published report.
   The Houston Post reported Wednesday that Bentsen's blind trust
has invested $564,000 in Lan Bentsen's new business, Performance
Property Management. But Senate records show the investment
originated as a personal loan from the Bentsen to his son in
October 1986 for between $100,000 to $250,000 that was later
transferred as a note receiveable to his trust in August 1987.
   Bentsen, the Texas senator, denied Tuesday that he influenced
the investment decision and said he saw nothing unusual about the
transaction.
   ``I don't consider it unusual to consider how a father would
feel about the investment in his son's buisness,'' Bentsen said.
``I consider it an investment in my son's future.''

<HEAD>Senior Citizens Group To Launch Anti-Bush Drive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Council of Senior Citizens have
announced a campaign that they say will remind Republican
presidential nominee George Bush of his 1985 vote in favor of a
freeze on Social Security benefits.
   The council, which claims 4.5 million members, said Wednesday it
will undertake a massive distribution of voting records, literature
and lawn signs to turn out older voters on behalf of Democrat
Michael Dukakis for the Nov. 8 election.
   The group planned to kick off its effort with news conferences
today in 14 cities in Wisconsin, Illinois, California, Washington
state and Ohio.
   Bush cast a tie-breaking vote on May 9, 1985 to defeat an
amendment to exempt Social Security cost-of-living increases from a
proposed federal budget freeze for 1986. However, President Reagan
refused to endorse the freeze and it never became law.

<HEAD>Republicans Criticize Dukakis on Pardons But Records Show GOP No
Tougher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans, led by presidential nominee George
Bush have repeatedly criticized Massachusetts governor Michael
Dukakis for granting pardons to more than 230 ex-convicts since
1983, but records show he has been tougher on the issue than his
GOP predecessors.
   The Massachusetts Civic Interest Council, in a report released
Tuesday, said the Democratic presidential nominee pardoned 232
people between 1983 and 1987.
   The council, a non-profit, research organization founded and
initially funded by state GOP Chairman Ray Shamie, claims no ties
to the Republican leader. And Bull Purdun, president of the
council, said it was not trying to make ``an overall judgment''
about Dukakis.
   The report showed Dukakis cleared criminal records ranging from
five cases of manslaughter to 136 cases of breaking and entering
and that 21 of his pardons were granted to people convicted of
selling or possessing with intent to sell drugs.
   However, figures provided by the governor's Statehouse press
office show that Dukakis has granted fewer pardons than his
predecessors.
   Republican governor John Volpe granted 1,324 pardons between
1965 and 1968, and GOP Frank Sargent granted 1,755 pardons between
1969 and 1974.

   ``Gotta get the red, prez,'' Bozo counseled.
   The vice president finally connected, sending the clown down
with a left-handed toss.

<HEAD>Pinochet Seeks Opposition Support, Foes and Backers Clash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Right-wing President Augusto Pinochet
made a rare plea for opposition support in his bid to rule until
1997, while the general's supporters and foes reportedly battled in
the streets of a southern city.
   According to Radio Cooperative of Santiago, 10 people were
injured, one seriously, when pro- and anti-Pinochet demonstrators
clashed Wednesday in the city of Valdivia, about 500 miles south of
Santiago.
   Police arrested 30 of the demonstrators, the radio said, quoting
a local youth leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Party.
   In Santiago, students opposed to Pinochet protested Wednesday in
two small demonstrations broken up by police, who reported 19
arrests and no injuries.
   In a 20-minute address broadcast to the nation via radio and
television Wednesday night, Pinochet said he planned to forge a
``new democracy'' offering economic progress and legal safeguards
against communism.
   ``This ambitious challenge is not the task of only some,'' said
the 72-year-old Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup.
``Our democracy needs the collaboration of all Chileans.''
   ``Our democracy ... will be enriched and improved by
disagreement and legitimate pluralism,'' he added.
   The speech was Pinochet's first formal campaign address since
his nomination Tuesday by fellow military commanders as the sole
candidate in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum. The selection
prompted street disturbances in which three people were killed, at
least 20 injured and more than 800 arrested.
   ``The farce has been consumated,'' the president of the centrist
Christian Democratic Party, Patricio Aylwin, said Wednesday of
Pinochet's nomination. ``As was foreseeable ... Pinochet imposed
his force and ambition.''
   Members of a 16-party opposition coalition on Wednesday signed
an accord calling for full democracy.
   If Pinochet wins a majority of votes in the ballot, he will
begin a new eight-year term starting in March. If a majority of the
citizens vote ``no'' in the referendum, a multi-candidate election
will be held in 1990, with Pinochet remaining in power until then.
   If Pinochet loses, the referendum accord also calls for changes
in a 1980 constitution drafted by the government, which grants the
military strong supervisory powers over national policy.
   Opposition leaders _ whom Pinochet has in the past denounced as
``traitors,'' ``cowards'' and ``rats'' _ were considered highly
unlikely to heed his appeal for their support.
   Many polls show Pinochet trailing the opposition in voter
support and the speech indicated plans to promote a conciliatory
image in the campaign.
   Pinochet spoke to Chileans _ whom he addressed as ``my dear
friends'' _ in the style of a fireside chat, with a framed
photograph of his wife on a wooden desk surrounded by a Chilean
flag, a computer and books.
   Even his supporters admit Pinochet suffers from a dictatorial
image after imposing fierce political repression following the coup
that brought him to power. He suspended many civil liberties and
ordered thousands of leftists arrested or expelled.
   Hundreds of citizens were killed or disappeared after being
arrested by security forces, human rights groups say.
   The coup toppled the elected government of President Salvador
Allende _ a self-declared Marxist _ and ended decades of democratic
rule.
   In his address, Pinochet said the coup saved Chile from becoming
``a Marxist slave state.''

<HEAD>House Of Commons Approves Free-Trade Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents waved the flag and sang ``O Canada'' to
decry what they called a sellout of national sovereignty as the
House of Commons overwhelmingly approved a sweeping trade bill that
will open the border to more U.S. goods and services.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives, with
207 of the 282 seats in Commons, easily defeated the combined
opposition on Wednesday and sent the bill to the Senate on a 177-64
vote.
   Members of the opposition-dominated Senate vowed to stall the
bill, which was signed Jan. 2 by President Reagan and Mulroney.
   The deal would amend 27 federal statutes to eliminate tariffs
and reduce other barriers in nearly every facet of the $150 billion
annual trading partnership between the neigbors.
   Proponents, including big business, have touted it as a boon to
business and jobs and say it will cut the $2 billion a year in
tariffs that Canadian businesses and consumers pay on U.S. imports.
   Opponents, who include labor and cultural leaders, say the deal
threatens Canada's sovereignty. They argue that jobs will be lost
as U.S. businesses move into the Canadian market.
   ``This is a very positive development for jobs, for the youth of
Canada for their economic future,'' Mulroney told reporters after
the vote.
   In Washington, a spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said the United States has invested a lot of time, energy
and money negotiating the deal. The U.S. House of Representatives
has approved the bill, and it is expected to pass the Senate this
month.
   ``We are pleased the House of Commons overwhelmingly passed the
free-trade agreement because we believe the deal is good for both
countries,'' the spokesman, Kelly Winkler, said.
   Liberal Parliament members unfurled a full-size Canadian flag
and sang the national anthem, ``O Canada,'' to interrupt the final
vote on the deal, which is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 and be
phased in over a 10-year period.
   They were joined by New Democrats, who had their own miniature
Canadian flags.
   Proponents of the bill wore buttons Canadian flag buttons that
read, ``Free trade _ stronger Canada.''
   Some protesters were removed from a visitors' gallery after they
interrupted the vote by chanting, ``We want an election!''
   The Liberal majority in the Senate has vowed to block the bill
until after the next election, which Mulroney has indicated will be
this fall _ before the deal takes effect.
   House Speaker John Fraser twice admonished legislators to settle
down and told them to put down their flags.
   ``The battle goes to the people, the people of Canada,'' said
Liberal leader John Turner as he left the Commons.
   Trade Minister John Crosbie acknowledged that the deal is far
from complete: ``We'll do whatever is required in reference to the
Senate, but in the meantime, we'll wait and see what happens as far
as an election is concerned.''
   Gordon Ritchie, Canada's deputy chief trade negotiator over the
two years of talks with the United States, agreed. ``We're saving
the champagne for (Senate) ratification,'' he said.
   Under the trade agreement, both countries would begin phasing
out border taxes, quotas, standards and other regulations that stop
or discourage trade. Disputes could be referred to five-member
panels of trade experts from both countries for settlement.
   Public opinion surveys indicate Canadians are nearly equally
divided on the agreement.
   Opposition stems from a variety of areas. Ontario grape growers,
for example, are upset because the pact would eliminate an
automatic 65 percent markup on U.S.-made wine.
   Pro-Canada Network, a coalition of labor, social, women's, farm
and other groups, believes the bill could turn Canada into the 51st
state. Canadians are outnumbered by their powerful neighbor 10-1.
   Protests broke out across Canada the day Reagan and Mulroney
signed the bill. More than 1,000 union-organized protesters
chanting ``No Free Trade'' disrupted traffic for half an hour on
the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit.
   A smaller, peaceful demonstration was held at Peace Bridge
between Fort Erie, Ontario, and Buffalo, N.Y.
   Protesters in London, Ontario, filled a black coffin with
Canadian products they said would be endangered if cheaper U.S.
goods flooded the country. One schoolteacher told the crowd: ``I
teach your children. We want a future for them. There's no way I
want to use textbooks made in the United States.''

   The crew of a Delta jetliner that crashed
at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport had clean flying
records, and the plane had only minor problems recently, according
to Federal Aviation Administration records.
   A pump-like device known as a power controller actuator on a
wing flap had to be replaced in July 1987 after a flap on the Delta
Air Lines Boeing 727's right wing jammed, the documents filed in
the last five years said.
   The actuator, which is activated as part of the process of
operating the flaps during takeoffs and landings, was removed and
returned to the manufacturer, and a new one was installed,
according to the records at the agency's headquarters here.
   Inspectors in August 1983 found two small cracks in the fuselage
skin, the FAA records said. The first crack measured one-half inch
in length at the corner of the pilot's window. The other, found in
an inspection the same month, was three-quarters of an inch long at
the upper corner of the captain's windshield, the report said.
   Bobbie Mardis, a spokeswoman for the FAA, described the problems
as very minor.
   A report showed that on Nov. 13, 1986, at Raleigh, N.C., the
aircraft didn't stay at the altitude assigned by air traffic
controllers, Ms. Mardis said.
   The aircraft was built by Boeing in 1973 and delivered new to
Delta, the FAA said.
   None of the crew of Wednesday's flight _ pilot Larry Davis,
co-pilot Carey Wilson Kirkland Jr. and flight engineer Stephen Judd
_ had a previous record of accident, incident or violation, Ms.
Mardis said.
   The three were among the nearly 100 survivors of Wednesday's
crash, which occurred during take off. The cause of the crash was
not determined, federal investigators said. Davis, 48, has been a
Delta pilot since 1965 and a Boeing 727 captain for the last nine
years; Kirkland, 37, was hired by Delta in 1979; and Judd has been
with Delta since November, said airline spokesman Henry Conley in
Dallas.
   The jetliner was powered by JT8D engines manufactured by
Connecticut-based Pratt & Whitney, which sent two investigators to
the scene.
   The engines are a mainstay of the airline industry, according to
David M. Long, a Pratt & Whitney spokesman. Long said the company
routinely sends investigators to crashes in which aircraft are
powered by Pratt & Whitney engines.
   Long said it was ``way to early'' to speculate on the cause of
the crash.
   The JT8D received its initial certification from the FAA in 1967
and about 10,000 are now in use. It provides a thrust at takeoff of
14,000 to 18,000 pounds, according to Pratt & Whitney documents.
   Problems with JT8D engines were cited as factors in 1985 airline
crashes in London and Milwaukee.

   A 9-year-old girl drowned in a golf course
water hazard along with her 11-year-old brother, who may have been
trying to save her despite being unable to swim, officials said.
   Bystanders and medical workers Tuesday evening were unable to
revive Rachel and Juan Silvia after they were pulled out of a canal
that forms a water hazard at the Ascarate Municipal Golf Course.
   The children were pronounced dead at Thomason Hospital two hours
after golfers plucked them from the 5-foot-deep canal, El Paso
County sheriff's deputies said.
   The children and a 7-year-old sister probably were playing in
the canal when Rachel fell in, said sheriff's Sgt. Marvin Ryals.
   ``The brother may have tried to save the girl,'' Ryals said.
   Michael Hutcherson of Pampa was playing golf when he noticed
Juan splashing around in the water. He asked the 7-year-old girl
whether her brother was in trouble, and she said she thought so.
   ``I knew he was in trouble then, and I hit the water,''
Hutcherson said.
   He pulled Juan out and tried to revive him while a fellow golfer
ran for help. The 7-year-old went for the children's mother,
Patricia Silva. When they came back, someone asked the little girl
where Rachel was.
   ``She said the other girl was the same place her brother had
been,'' Hutcherson said. ``I knew right then the boy I was trying
to save had been trying to save his sister.''
   An unidentified bystander jumped in, found the girl and pulled
her out.
   ``We got a lot of help from bystanders,'' said Kevin Hobin, an
Emergency Medical Services supervisor. ``Everyone there was really
pulling for those two.''
   Ms. Silva had taken the children to the park Tuesday afternoon,
Ryals said.
   ``They apparently were left unattended,'' Ryals said. ``They
didn't know how to swim at all.''

   The drummer for singer Kenny Rogers has
been formally charged with first-degree murder in the shooting of
his ex-wife.
   Bobby Daniels, 41, was being held in Metro Jail without bond
pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for today.
   He is accused of shooting Sylvia K. Coakley, 35, a real estate
agent, through a storm door of her home before dawn Aug. 16.
   The couple had been divorced for about eight years, but problems
escalated between the two in the weeks before the shooting,
authorities said.
   Coakley had taken out a warrant for Daniels' arrest on charges
of assault and battery when he allegedly assaulted her in her home
July 13.
   Daniels has been Rogers' drummer for about a dozen years. He
also was co-producer of the 1986 music video, ``Superbowl
Shuffle,'' which was recorded by members of the Chicago Bears
football team.

   When John Sawyer landed his
single-engine airplane on a street here recently to conduct some
business, he also landed in trouble.
   City officials are seeking a court injunction to make sure he
doesn't use streets for runways again.
   Sawyer landed his airplane on a street Aug. 24 in this city of
15,000 people 20 miles northwest of Denver to conduct business at
the nearby Colorado Tech Center.
   City Administrator Dave Stahl happened to glance out his
second-floor office window to see the small plane preparing to land.
   Since there was no airport in that direction, Stahl and police
officers investigated, ending up with a chat with Sawyer, who
couldn't understand what the fuss was about.
   Sawyer, a telecommunications consultant, said he routinely uses
his plane to make business calls in the area, and has flown in to
the Tech Center four times during the past four months to pick up
equipment or attend meetings.
   He said he doesn't leave the plane in the street. He parks it in
the company parking lot.
   ``I didn't even come within 500 feet of a building,'' Sawyer
said.
   ``That's like saying there's no buildings on U.S. 36, so you
could land there,'' Stahl said. ``When you land a plane on a public
street, you don't know ... if a pedestrian, car, bicyclist or
motorcyclist are in the area.''
   But Sawyer said, ``It's a city street in name only. There's not
even any light poles around. It's vacant land. There's zilch
traffic out there.
   ``It looks far more like a landing strip than a road.''
   Sawyer challenged city officials to cite a law forbidding planes
from landing on city streets. The city responded by pointing to its
zoning laws and seeking an injunction in Boulder District Court to
ban Sawyer from making runways out of Louisville streets.
   Mitch Baker, public affairs officer for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Seattle, said there is no federal law prohibiting
a plane from landing on a public street.
   But he said FAA regulations prohibit landings that endanger
people on the ground.
   ``I intend to fight it,'' Sawyer said of the city's court
action. ``I'm not doing this for fun. It's for convenience.''

   Grace Eldering, a bacteriologist who
with another Grand Rapids woman developed a vaccine against
whooping cough, has died.
   She was 87 and died Wednesday.
   Eldering, who suffered from whooping cough when she was 5,
developed the vaccine with Dr. Pearly L. Kendrick during the 1930s
at the state Department of Public Health's Western Michigan
Division Laboratory in Grand Rapids.
   Their vaccine remains in use against whooping cough, an
infectious respiratory disease that once killed up to 6,000
children a year nationwide.
   Eldering was born in Montana, earned a bachelor's degree in 1927
from the University of Montana and a doctorate in science from
Johns Hopkins University in 1941. She worked from 1928 to 1951 as a
bacteriologist with the Michigan Department of Public Health and
was director of the Grand Rapids laboratory from 1951 until her
retirement in 1969.
   She is survived by a sister and two nieces. Services were
scheduled for Tuesday in Grand Rapids.

   Share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on
Thursday, while the U.S. dollar rose sharply against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the Tokyo stock
market's main barometer, closed at 26,934.26 points, down 431.69
points, or 1.58 percent.
   In foreign exchange trading, the dollar, which opened at 136.20
yen, 1.23 yen higher than Wednesday's close, finished at 136.70
yen, up 1.73 yen.
   The dollar's rise was due to a sell-off of the yen by investors,
according to foreign exchange analysts. Sumio Fukushima of Sumitomo
Bank in Tokyo said one of the factors cited was the Bank of Japan's
announcement Wednesday that it would not raise interest rates.
   Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Bank, said
investors who had been selling West German marks now were targeting
the yen.
   ``After interest rates rose in Europe last week, the rate in
Japan has become the lowest and investors started selling the yen
to buy more dollars,'' he said.
   But Kakimoto speculated the fluctuating exchange rate was
temporary.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa dismissed concern over the
yen's downswing. ``Currency rates change every day,'' said Miyazawa.
   On the stock exchange, share prices were lower across the board,
according to an analyst with Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
   ``Almost nothing has been traded this morning, because investors
were shocked by the yen's downfall,'' he said.
   ``I almost jumped up when I found out the Bank of Japan had
announced they would not raise interest rates, because investors
certainly would lose interest in the yen,'' the analyst said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Israeli Think Tank: Chances For War With Syria Diminishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria's faltering economy, lack of
allies and friction with Moscow lessen the chances that Damascus
would engage Israel in a war, according to an Israeli think tank.
   The assessment contrasts with frequent warnings from Israeli
officials and military commanders, who stress the military threat
posed by the Soviet-backed Syrian regime.
   The study released Wednesday by Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies also says enhanced Arab capabilities
means Israel's rear echelon is no longer immune to missile or
chemical weapons attack.
   The 498-page annual study, entitled Middle East Military
Balance, says Syria's total armed forces have declined from 840,000
in 1986 to 730,000 last year. It says President Hafez Assad was
last year forced to trim his defense budget by about $100 million,
or 3 percent.
   ``Due to extreme economic difficulties, Syria was forced to
mothball a couple of divisions and remains without allies. It also
increasingly appears to be encountering differences of opinions
with the Soviets,'' Joseph Alpher, executive editor of the study,
said in an interview.
   Retired Brig. Gen. Aharon Levran, a former intelligence officer,
wrote in the report that the belt-tightening ``genuinely weakened''
Syria's armed forces by reducing training time and cutting back on
fuel and food for the troops.
   Alpher predicted the end of the Iran-Iraq war will likely
increase the traditional rivalry between Baghdad and Damascus. That
and the unresolved conflict in Lebanon could preoccupy Syria.
   He said Syria has warehoused hundreds of tanks and turned
regular army units into reserve forces.
   ``If a state plans to go to war in the next six months or a
year, it usually doesn't do things like that,'' said Levran, who
also commanded armor and infantry units before retiring in 1984.
   The Jaffee Center experts said that in any future war Israel,
would be more vulnerable to attacks aimed at population centers or
locations where reserve units are mobilized.
   They said Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia had developed
intermediate range ballistic missiles, chemical warheads and longer
range air power.
   ``I see a very reasonable possibility that they will be used on
military targets in a possible future war and maybe even the home
front,'' said retired Brig. Gen. Aryeh Shalev of the Jaffee Center.
   Alpher said Iraq became the first Arab country to develop
long-range bombing capability, even though it was only 18 percent
effective in hitting targets.
   ``At least on paper, that air arm could be used against Israel
just as it was used in long range bombing runs all the way to the
Straits of Hormuz (in the Persian Gulf,)'' Alpher said.
   He also said Iraq had emerged from the war with a large army and
a newly developed ability to move armor quickly with an impressive
force of 3,000 tank transporters.
   In the future, he said such a capability could allow Iraq to
bring ``more and better'' forces to Israel's eastern front than in
the past.
   He also noted Saudi Arabia had acquired long-range missiles from
China and that other such missiles were being developed by Iraq
with Egypt and Argentina, and by Libya with Brazil.
   ``We looked around us and suddenly saw that we were surrounded
by countries that had an intermediate range ballistic missile
capacity, with the exception of Jordan and Lebanon,'' Alpher said.
   He said Iraq had ``semi-legitimized'' the use of chemical
weapons during the Persian Gulf war and this could result in such
weapons being used against Israel in a future war.
   The Israeli analysis says the Syrians indicated they have
developed chemical warheads only as a counter to Israel's perceived
edge in nuclear potential: ``The probability that they would be
used in a war against Israel seems low because of (Israel's)
enhanced retaliatory capability.''
   Alpher said that despite Iraq's increased capabilities it is
unlikely President Saddam Hussein would want to plunge his country
into a new military conflict after eight years of war.

   On a glorious Texas morning, Delta
Flight 1141 pulled away at 8:31 a.m. from Gate 15 at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport's Terminal 4-E to continue a flight
that began in Jackson, Miss.
   Then in the hazy sunshine that so previews a hot August day, the
Boeing 727 carrying more than 100 people to Salt Lake City idled
for 30 minutes on a taxiway.
   Just after 9 a.m., Capt. Larry Davis received clearance from the
tower and steered the jet down a runway toward the south end of the
sprawling airfield.
   ``We didn't make 50 feet in the air,'' said Jim Hammock, of
Garland, who was aboard the plane.
   Then the plane bounced.
   ``We all just clinched,'' said Michelle Christensen, 25, of
Dallas.
   It bounced again.
   ``Oh my God,'' Melissa Lewis, 24, of Tupelo, Miss., cried out.
She began praying out loud.
   The plane bounced yet a third time.
   ``The ride got very rough,'' said Bernard Glim, 69, of North
Port, Fla.
   ``We were tossed back and forth,'' said his wife, Natalie.
   It was relatively quiet inside.
   ``We veered to the right,'' said Peter Wright, of Dallas. ``I
heard a banging noise under the carriage and then someone said,
`We're not going to make it!'''
   Everything got dark.
   ``And then it was orange,'' Ms. Christensen said.
   Smoke filled the cabin. Flames licked outside.
   ``The smoke was coming down fearfully,'' Glim said. ``It came
down to, I'd say, about 2 feet from the floor. It was difficult to
breathe. It was very tight trying to get to any place in the plane,
particularly a hatch.''
   ``You were just looking for a way to get out of the plane,''
said Penn Waugh, of Dallas. ``You're hoping you weren't going to
die.''
   Someone kicked the door open.
   ``It was a big fire,'' according to 5-year-old Evan Wood, who
was traveling with his mother and 2-year-old brother. ``We jumped
out.''
   The fuselage cracked, about 5 feet behind the cockpit. It
cracked again, about 25 feet from the rear of the plane and about 5
feet in front of the engines, and rolled on its side.
   ``You just slide down the side and jump,'' Penn Waugh said.
``Everybody kept jumping. One side was on fire, so you couldn't get
out on the left side. You had to crawl out the right side.''
   People were saying, `Let's get out of here! Let's get out!'''
   The wings were red hot from the heat. The flames intensified.
   But at least 94 people would survive.
   ``We were just terrified. We jumped on the wing, but it looked
like we were jumping into a pit of fire,'' said Mona Thomason.

   Above, below and on board doomed Delta
Air Lines Flight 1141, people realized something was terribly
wrong. They watched horrified as the plane skidded off a runway,
splintered, crashed and burned.
   Then they marveled that anyone survived the accident Wednesday
at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The crash killed 13,
but at least 94 survived, authorities said.
   ``I saw it take off and I knew something was wrong,'' said Lon
Might, an airport employee.
   Passengers in a commuter plane arriving at the airport spotted
the Boeing 727 struggling to get airborne and shouted encouragement
to the pilot.
   ``We were cheering this guy to get the plane off the ground,''
said Gene Metzig. ``It was very emotional.''
   Said Michelle Christensen, 25, a Dallas real estate agent aboard
Flight 1141: ``The minute we took off the ground I knew we were
going to crash.''
   From an office building, Edward Leb looked out and noticed the
aircraft was not flying in a normal position, that it was almost
level with the ground and its nose barely was up.
   ``And then it just fell straight down. It fell like a pancake on
its big belly, the back end lower than the front end,'' Leb said.
   At an airport toll booth, Mary Centron, 47, of Hurst, who
witnessed a Delta Air Lines crash here three years ago, knew at
once the plane was flying ``too damn low to be taking off.''
   Sobbing, nauseated and recalling the previous tragedy, in which
137 died, she said: ``The tail disappeared first, and next the nose
disappeared behind a hill, and then there was a humongous fireball.
... I didn't think anybody had made it.''
   Aboard the craft, en route from Jackson, Miss., to Salt Lake
City via Dallas, passenger Peter Wright heard a ``banging noise''
under the carriage and then someone exclaim: ``We're not going to
make it!''
   Within moments of its 9 a.m. takeoff, Flight 1141 dropped like a
wounded bird from the cloudless sky, skidded off the runway,
bounced into a field of waist-high prairie grass and broke apart in
flames, smoke and debris.
   The crash ripped off one wing and two engines, tore three gaping
holes in the fuselage and left the crippled aircraft with its tail
dangling and its nose twisted grotesquely to one side.
   ``It looks like a beached and dying bottlenosed dolphin,'' said
a photographer. Others said it resembled a giant, stricken goose.
   No one could say with certainty what happened, only that the
death toll could have been staggering. Authorities indicated most
of the deaths were caused by burns and smoke inhalation and that
most of the injuries were cuts, scrapes and bruises.
   ``We feel lucky there were only 13 victims,'' said Dr. Nizam
Peerwani, the Tarrant County medical examiner. ``Initially we were
told there would be 60 bodies, so we were prepared for the worst.''
   Jim Hartman, Department of Public Safety officer at the airport,
called it ``incredible'' that so many survived. In fact, early
reports from the control tower indicated the crash was
``non-survivable.''
   Said Norman Newcity, 36, a Georgia businessman hospitalized with
a broken heel: ``It was just like a roller coaster ride with
everything coming apart, everything flying apart.''
   ``We were going down the runway and the sound of the engine
changed,'' said Melissa Lewis, 24, a graduate student at
Mississippi State University. ``There was a different sound.''
   Other passengers said they heard knocking noises or popping
sounds or loud thumps, and Dale Patterson, 36, of Plano, thought it
``sounded like it blew a tire.''
   But Dan Walker, a 40-year-old Dallas veterinarian, said, ``There
was no audible explosion before the crash.'' He said the plane did
encounter ``turbulence'' before it veered out of control and
insisted that the pilot did an excellent job of ``bringing it down
on its belly.''
   Walker suffered a fractured rib but was treated and released.
Two Dallas-area friends with him on a planned fishing excursion to
Montana were hospitalized with more serious injuries.
   Austin attorney Rick Arnett, seated in a plane on the ground,
said he and other passengers saw the wobbly Delta jetliner through
their windows and were hollering: ``Get up! Get up!''
   But it was not to be.

<HEAD>Relief For Fire-Ravaged Northwest Predicted in October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Weather Service predicts the
Northwestern section of the country won't get any relief from the
unusually hot, dry weather that has contributed to fires ravaging
the area until well after Labor Day.
   Government broadcasters said Wednesday above-normal temperatures
will persist over much of the West during the next five days
through the Labor Day weekend, and a trend toward rain and cooler
temperatures won't begins until sometime in October.
   ``Only the longer outlook through November brings cool, wet
conditions to the Northwest,'' the service said. It should be
warmer in the Southwest and California and most areas of the East,
with rain extending up the Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the
Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic regions.
   The service added that streamflows are expected to remain below
average across much of the country, and water reserves at major
reservoirs remain average to below average for this time of year
across much of the country.

<HEAD>Library of Congress Gets Gift of Music</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Library of Congress has received what it
called the greatest composite gift in the history of its music
division.
   The library announced Wednesday that Hans Moldenhauer, a
Spokane, Wash., pianist, teacher and musicologist who died last
October, bequeathed to it several thousand documents written by
composers, musicians and literary figures dating to the 12th
century, including hand-written musical scores by Beethoven, Chopin
and Mendelssohn.
   The bequest, received in July, represents the overwhelming bulk
of the Moldenhauer collection, which the library described as ``one
of the greatest archives of musical primary source materials ever
assembled.''
   The oldest of the documents apparently is 18 lines of Latin text
on vellum, with musical notations, from a 12th century German
prayer book.
   Among the many composers represented in the collection is a copy
in Ludwig van Beethoven's handwriting of music from Mozart's opera,
``Don Giovanni,'' probably written as studies for portions of
Beethoven's only opera, ``Fidelio.''

<HEAD>Postal Service, Union Sign Pact To Reduce Grievances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service has for the first time
ever signed an agreement concerning the labor-management climate
with a union representing its employees.
   The service and the National Association of Letter Carriers on
Wednesday signed a non-binding ``joint commitment'' to try to
reduce grievance appeals, arbitrations and employment
discrimination complaints against the service ually.
   According to Postal Service records, 19,543 grievances were
appealed beyond the local level by members of the Letter Carriers
union in the 12 months ending Aug. 1, and 10,766 individual
disputes were taken to arbitration.
   In addition, members of the union filed 2,128 complaints of age,
sex or race discrimination against the Postal Service with the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, the first head of the
service to address a postal union convention, said last month in
Portland, Ore. ``These processes ... break down the old `them' and
`us' attitudes and promote a positive spirit of cooperation.''

   Fire crews mobilized in the Star Valley of eastern Idaho after
the 6,800-acre Trail Creek fire, fanned by shifting winds, broke
through a control line and raced to within a mile of ranches and
grain fields. The fire was the most threatening of 17 major blazes
burning over more than 70,000 acres. Over 2,500 firefighters,
backed up by National Guard personnel and equipment, were on the
lines.
   The 7,900-acre Eagle Bar fire near Hells Canyon at the Oregon
line burned out of control for the 12th day.
   The supply of fresh fire crew members dwindles as workers enter
their third week of duty. The U.S. Forest Service predicted hot and
dry weather well past the Labor Day weekend.

   Montana's three largest fires are burning primarily in
wilderness areas: the 51,000-acre Canyon Creek fire in the
Scapegoat Wilderness in northwest Montana; and the 43,000-acre
Storm Creek fire and 42,000-acre Hellroaring Creek fire in the
Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north of Yellowstone National Park.
   The Canyon Creek fire is burning toward several ranches outside
the wilderness, while firefighters are trying to prevent the other
two fires from burning south into the park.
   Gov. Ted Schwinden appealed to the public Wednesday to avoid
outdoor recreation over the Labor Day weekend to limit the fire
risk.
   The governor said 5,000 firefighters were battling blazes on
208,000 acres in Montana, and 173,000 acres burned in earlier
fires. He put the cost at $15 million.

   Oregon's Department of Forestry announced Wednesday that 3.8
million acres of private, state and other forest in eastern Oregon
would be closed until further notice due to extreme fire danger and
scarce resources to fight new blazes.
   Oregon's biggest forest fire, the Tepee Butte fire, has burned
36,000 acres of grass and timber on the Wallowa-Whitman National
Forest and the Hell's Canyon National Recreation Area. The fire is
expected to grow to 59,000 acres before it reaches fire lines.
   The Forest Service began training the first of 700 back-up
firefighters to spell weary crews in Oregon and Washington.

<HEAD>Several Factors Led To Fluctuating Casualty Counts In Delta Crash</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Delta Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The confusing scene at the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport and Delta Air Lines' policy of not counting infants riding
its flights free contributed to erroneous reports of how many
people died aboard Flight 1141, airline officials said.
   At least one infant was among the 13 passengers known to have
died when the Boeing 727 crashed and caught fire seconds after
takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Wednesday.
   At least 94 passengers and crew escaped, although some
discrepancies remained early today between lists provided by
hospitals and Delta.
   The number of casualties fluctuated throughout the day
Wednesday, from seven to 15, down to nine, up to 11 and then to 13.
   Bill Berry, a Delta spokesman in Atlanta, said one reason for
the discrepancies was that officials weren't sure how many children
under age 2 were aboard.
   ``An infant does not buy a ticket, and if it does not buy a
ticket, so many times you are going to have a discrepancy in your
manifest count,'' Berry said.
   He said passengers don't normally notify ticket agents that they
plan to take an infant on board.
   At least three infants were aboard the jet, he said. One was
among the dead _ but the fates of the others weren't known.
   Part of the problem, Berry said, was that emergency personnel on
the scene requested 15 body bags initially _ leading Delta
officials to give out an erroneous casualty figure. Later some
victims died at hospitals.
   Victims were taken to eight hospitals.
   ``As you well know, in these types of situations, the numbers
often fluctuate until you can get various hospitals contacted,''
Berry said.

   The main index, which had its third-biggest one-day plunge this
year, was down 664 points at midmorning. The Nikkei finished below
the 27,000-point level for the first time since May 28, when it
closed at 26,962.50, losing 327.99 points.
   The U.S. dollar, which opened at 136.20 yen with a 1.23 yen jump
from Wednesday's close of 134.97 yen, was firmer toward the end of
the trading, to close at 136.70, up 1.73 yen. The currency ranged
between 136.05 yen and 136.80 yen, with spot volume estimated at
$7.98 billion.
   ``The dollar was getting stronger all day. Dollar-selling for
some investors' profit-taking could not outweigh the dollar-buying
drive in the market,'' said Hiroyuki Sekine of the Daiwa Bank in
Tokyo.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa earlier said, ``Currency rates
change every day,'' dismissing concern over the yen's downswing.
   Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Bank, said
investors who have been selling West German marks are now targeting
the Japanese yen.
   ``After interest rates rose in Europe last week, the rate in
Japan has become the lowest and investors started selling the yen
to buy more dollars,'' he said.
   But the spokesman for the Bank of Japan said Japan need not
raise interest rates just because other countries did.
   On the stock exchange, share prices were lower across the board
except a few issues bought in the afternoon session, said an
analyst with Nomura Securities in Tokyo. Among the losers were
steels, shipbuilding and chemical issues.
   Dealers said the downfall of the yen immediately following the
Bank of Japan's announcement Wednesday made investors stay away
from the stock trading.

<HEAD>Honduras Blames Rebel Exodus On Lack Of Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo blamed
the influx to his country of Nicaraguan rebels and their civilian
supporters on a lack of democracy under the Sandinista government.
   He said more than 24,0000 of the guerrillas, known as Contras,
have fled across the border into Honduran camps since April _ a
figure Honduran officials say includes 11,000 rebels and 13,000
civilians. An estimated 2,000 rebels remain inside Nicaragua.
   ``The lack of democracy by the Sandinistas is paid for by
Honduras, which is a victim of the Central American problem,''
Azcona Hoyo said Wednesday. ``It is necessary to strengthen the
struggle to democratize Nicaragua.''
   Azcona Hoyo said the leftist Sandinistas ``deliberately lifted
protection of their border to allow the Contras to move into
Honduras.''
   Other estimates say the number of Contras in Honduras who
receive food, medicine, clothing and other non-lethal U.S. aid
totals 14,000 _ including 9,000 rebels and 5,000 civilians. The
exodus began in April, after Nicaraguan government forces withdrew
from two northern border areas under a March 23 peace plan.
   The United States, which has supplied and trained the rebels
since 1981, cut off military aid to the Contras at the end of
February. Congress has refused to renew the funding, saying it
would violate a cease-fire the two sides have agreed to.
   However, Congress earmarked $17 million in non-lethal aid to the
rebels _ supplied on condition that it go to Honduras, not
Nicaragua. The supplies began arriving in April and are being
distributed by the Agency for International Development.

   Jerry Weeks said he rushed to help at
the scene of the fiery crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 because
he could not ignore another tragedy at Dallas-Forth Worth
International Airport.
   ``I just bit my lip and went,'' said Weeks, 45, who runs an
airport shuttle bus company and has long regretted not offering his
aid after the 1985 crash of Delta Flight 191, which killed 137
people and injured 25 others.
   ``When 191 occurred, I was driving trucks and had just seen a
terrible accident in which some girls were beheaded,'' he said.
``I'm tough and I've seen plenty of horrendous wrecks as a truck
driver. But I was near the airport when 191 crashed and I just
couldn't go.''
   It was a different story Wednesday when Weeks, who is married to
an American Airlines flight attendant, became one of the first to
arrive and offer assistance after the crash, which killed at least
13 people.
   At first, Weeks and an Irving policeman he was with assumed the
thick column of billowing black smoke was merely a ``controlled
burn,'' another of the frequent drills held at the airport to
prepare emergency workers for plane crashes.
   But Eusebio Padilla, who drives a bus for Weeks' airport shuttle
service, called in on the company radio to say he had just seen a
plane go down.
   Padilla, 31, said he was putting gas in his bus at a filling
station on the south side of the airport when the crash occurred.
   ``It got up to about 30 or 40 feet up in the air, then it veered
to one side, and went out of my sight,'' Padilla said. ``Two
seconds later, I hear a large explosion. I see smoke and flames,
probably 30 feet up in the air.''
   Weeks in turn called police to report that a plane had just
crashed on the southwest quadrant of the airport. Police already
had received a handful of similar reports.
   Weeks arrived at the crash site within 10 minutes, remembering
Flight 191 and figuring he would join a team in the grim task of
tramping through brush for remains. When the smoke cleared, he was
shocked at what he found.
   ``It wasn't a violent crash,'' he recalled. ``About a dozen
survivors were standing up and walking around. Nobody was terribly
distraught.''
   Weeks went from survivor to survivor, all waiting to be
transported to area hospitals, and asked if he could call anyone
for them. Five of them took advantage of his offer. He also offered
free transportation to relatives upon their arrival to Dallas.
   ``It could have been so much worse,'' Weeks said. ``If you look
at where this plane stopped, you'll notice if stopped a couple
hundred yards short of water tanks. When Delta 191 crashed, it hit
the same kind of tanks on the other side of the airport and look
what happened. It could have been worse.''
   Weeks, a pilot himself for 20 years, said his first thought was
that he didn't want to see an air crash in person. His wife had
been due to take off in Chicago in 1979 when an American Airlines
DC-10 crashed, killing 275. He suffered through a couple of hours
until he learned it was not her plane.
   It is a worry shared by anyone married to an airline crew
member, Weeks said.
   ``You can be tough as a boot, but your heart still stops when
you hear there's a plane down.''

<HEAD>Appeals Judge Approves Massachusetts Unisex Insurance Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts joins Montana today as the only
states barring life insurance companies from their common practice
of charging men higher rates than women.
   Massachusetts' regulations became effective after a state
appellate judge refused Wednesday to delay the debut of the
so-called unisex rules. Women generally pay less than men for life
insurance because women statistically live longer than men and
therefore have more years to pay premiums.
   The ruling by state Appeals Judge Joseph Warner came in an
11th-hour appeal in a class-action suit filed by nine life
insurance policyholders. The lawsuit sought a temporary injunction
to block the regulations from taking effect until the case goes to
trial.
   ``We are disappointed, obviously, that the regulations have not
been enjoined,'' said Peter Lauriat, an attorney for the nine
plaintiffs. He predicted it will be at least three to six months
before the case is heard in Berkshire County, where it was filed.
   The plaintiffs contend that life insurance companies will raise
rates for women to comply with the regulations.
   But Assistant Attorney General Countess C. Williams argued that
it ``is not clear women will pay higher premiums'' under the new
regulations.
   Life insurance rates are unregulated in Massachusetts. Although
it is anticipated that insurers will ``blend'' their male and
female rates to reach a middle ground, there is no requirement to
do so, Lauriat said.
   Instead, Lauriat and some industry officials expect some
companies will simply raise women's rates to what men are charged _
which could add hundreds of dollars a year to some women's premiums.
   Under the regulations ordered by Insurance Commissioner Roger
Singer, life insurance companies are barred from using sex as a
basis for setting prmiums or benefits, just as the use of race,
color, religion, marital status and national origin are prohibited.
   Because the case hasn't been fully argued at the lower court
level, Warner's decision Wednesday was limited to affirming that
Berkshire Superior Court Judge John L. Moriarty committed ``no
error or abuse of discretion'' when he rejected the temporary
injunction request a week ago.
   Montana requires unisex insurance pricing under a state law
passed in 1985. A study indicated that after initial premium
increases of less than 10 percent for women, premiums were expected
to decrease and dividend returns were expected to increase.

   Grace Eldering, a bacteriologist who
with another Grand Rapids woman developed a vaccine against
whooping cough, died Wednesday at age 87.
   The Montana native, who suffered from whooping cough when she
was 5, developed the vaccine with Dr. Pearly L. Kendrick during the
1930s at the state Department of Public Health's laboratory here.
   Their vaccine remains in use against whooping cough, an
infectious respiratory disease that once killed up to 6,000 U.S.
children a year.
   Eldering was a bacteriologist with the public health department
from 1928 to 1951, when she became director of the Grand Rapids
laboratory. She held that post until her retirement in 1969.

<HEAD>Bakker Makes Highest Bid For PTL, Thinks He Has It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker made the highest bid for the
assets of PTL, moving him a giant step closer toward recapturing
the television ministry he was forced to leave after a sex and
money scandal.
   PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said he expected
today to formalize the $165 million proposal Bakker made Wednesday
to buy the Heritage USA Christian retreat, PTL television network
and other assets.
   Bakker and his attorney, Jim Toms, met Wednesday with Benton to
outline their plan.
   ``We've discussed the terms; we've agreed on everything,''
Benton said. ``The lawyers are now documenting it and as soon as
the papers are ready ... and everybody's agreed, we probably will
both sign it and then we'll have us a deal.''
   Toms said Bakker intends to present a letter of credit and to
make a formal announcement today of the plan, which could total
$200 million when money for improvements and repairs at Heritage
USA is included.
   Final approval of bids for PTL's assets rests with Bankruptcy
Judge Rufus Reynolds, who set a Sept. 10 deadline for Benton to
present any offers to buy the ministry, which is under Chapter 11
protection from creditors.
   Canadian real estate magnate Peter Thomas, chairman of Samoth
Capital Corp., had offered $113 million. Thomas said Wednesday he
was unwilling to increase his bid ``and enter a bidding war,'' but
was skeptical of Bakker's proposal.
   Bakker ``has been all talk so far'' and unwilling to reveal his
financial backers, he said. ``It makes one wonder where he's
getting the cash from.''
   Thomas said from his office in Vancouver that his $1 million
deposit was mailed back to him, but he added that his offer would
be renewed if Bakker fails to come up with the funding.
   PTL filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987, three
months after Bakker left the ministry amid allegations of misuse of
money and revelations of his sexual encounter with church secretary
Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker was greeted Wednesday at the offices of the Jim and Tammy
Ministries, his new ministry, by cheers of ``praise God'' and
``thank you, Jesus.''
   ``As it stands now, we will be able to have Heritage USA. It's
been a long wait,'' Bakker said to the applause of his followers.
   Bakker said he has the financial backing for a bid that totals
at least $165 million, including about $70 million in cash up front
at closing and up to $15 million to pay off debts owed Kansas
contractor Roe Messner, who was PTL's prime builder.
   Bakker also plans to obtain an $80 million mortgage on 1,000
acres of undeveloped land at Heritage USA. The money would be a
guarantee that he will restore the benefits of PTL's major
contributors, its so-called Lifetime Partners.
   ``When you boil it all down it's a matter of who would provide
the most dollars for the creditors,'' Benton said. He said there
remained the possibility that someone could come up with a better
bid. ``But it's getting late,'' he said.
   Benton had said he wanted all bids in before today.
   Bakker said his financial backer ``is a corporation of 28
international business people who pool their money for investments
in the U.S.'' He said the terms of his agreement with the backer
prevented him from further identifying those involved.
   Toms said a lawsuit filed by PTL officials, seeking to recover
$52 million from the Bakkers and his top aides for allegedly
mismanaging ministry funds, ``should not impede approval of the
plan.''
   ``Part of the negotiations included that all claims would be
assumed by the new owner,'' Toms said. ``If the suit were to
continue after Bakker regained the ministry, he would essentially
be suing himself.''

   Rival gang members emerged from peace talks
and stripped off their gang colors, donning white T-shirts as
symbolic evidence of their commitment to become ``silent warriors''
against street warfare.
   The gang members joined ministers and actor Robert Blake at a
news conference Wednesday following two days of talks at a secret
location.
   ``They will not be known as gangs. They will be known as silent
warriors. We're not forming a larger gang. We're not forming a
super gang to terrorize the city,'' said the Rev. Charles Mims Jr.,
organizer of two so-called gang summits held here this summer.
   About 50 members of various factions of the Bloods and Crips
gangs took off their shirts on the steps of City Hall and put on
the T-shirts depicting figures of the rival black gangs shaking
hands.
   Blake, who played an inner-city priest who helped street
hoodlums in the short-lived TV series ``Hell Town,'' said he has
been helping young people for 30 years and never witnessed such an
effort as the gang summit.
   ``I swear to you on the heads of my children that what I've seen
in the last couple of days is an absolute miracle,'' said Blake,
who sat in on the talks.
   ``I have been on the bus with Crips and Bloods together. I've
been in the room when they're eating lunch together. I've been with
them when they've held hands and prayed in a circle together. ... I
swear on my life that what I've seen in the last couple of days I
never thought I would see till the day I died.''
   The second gang summit was attended by about 90 gang members in
south-central Los Angeles, the area hardest hit by the gang
violence that has claimed more than 200 lives in Los Angeles County
this year.
   ``Rival gang members of Watts attended a gang summit and
challenge all other rival gang members to join us in stopping the
violence and killing in our neighborhoods,'' said a gang member
called ``Twilight,'' who also participated in the first talks.
   Mims said no truce had been called, but 15 factions have pledged
to end their gang affiliations, lay down their weapons and form a
network to bring about peace.
   ``These young people want jobs. They want homes. They want wives
and children and dogs in the front yard and birds in the back,'' he
said.
   Critics contend the gang summits are a futile gesture in the
face of the estimated 70,000 gang members and 600 gangs in Los
Angeles, but Mims said, ``A journey of 1,000 miles starts with one
step.''

   Most of the nation enjoyed clear skies and mild temperatures
this morning after thunderstorms in the Great Plains produced heavy
rain and hail as big as golf balls.
   Skies were mostly clear from New England to most of the Great
Lakes region, the Ohio Valley and the central Plains, and clear
skies prevailed in the Northwest and much of Texas and Arkansas.
   Thunderstorms moved across central Minnesota.
   The storms Wednesday night dropped golf ball-size hail near
Groton, S.D. Hail an inch in diameter covered the ground in Warner,
S.D.
   Scattered thunderstorms Wednesday night extended from southwest
Kansas to the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles and southwest Texas. In
the Oklahoma Panhandle, heavy rain fell for two to three hours,
leaving 4 to 6 inches of standing water on a highway in Texas
County.
   Widely scattered thunderstorms boomed Wednesday night over the
Gulf Coast states and near the south Atlantic Coast. Nearly 4
inches of rain fell at Meridian Naval Air Station, Miss.
   A few strong thunderstorms occurred around midnight in southern
Nevada and southeast California, generating winds gusting to 55 mph
at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nev.
   In Fresno, Calif., it was 106 degrees Wednesday, breaking the
105-degree record for the date set in 1950. The nation's high was
114 degrees in Palm Springs, Calif.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
across Gulf Coast and south Atlantic Coast states; widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms from Arkansas to Texas, western portions
of the central Plains and the southern Rockies to northern and
eastern Arizona; and scattered thunderstorms from the upper
Mississippi Valley to northern Michigan.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s and lower 90s across
most of the nation; the 90s to around 100 degrees in much of
Washington and Oregon; between 100 and 110 degrees in the desert
Southwest and interior valleys of California; the 70s in New
England, from northern Michigan to North Dakota and along the
Pacific Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.; Bradford, Pa.; and
Houlton, Maine, to 92 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson shook hands to seal a
shaky truce with Mayor Edward I. Koch, but warned the mayor's
re-election hopes could be hurt by his attacks on Jackson during
the New York presidential primary.
   ``Today's meeting did not focus on April 1988. ... I did not ask
the mayor to respond to April of '88. It is the people of this city
who must respond,'' Jackson said Wednesday after a more than
two-hour peace session convened by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Koch, who apologized for the stridency of his attacks on Jackson
during primary, told a packed news conference: ``We did not engage
in recreating history. We did not talk about the past, but about
the future _ Michael Dukakis' election.''
   The mayor also revealed he would not use any of the photos shot
with Jackson on Wednesday during his bid for a fourth term, and
seemed to surprise Jackson by shaking his hand. New York's mayoral
elections are next year.
   Koch endorsed Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee in the
Democratic primary and vociferously opposed Jackson, suggesting
Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for a candidate with Jackson's
positions on the Middle East. Blacks reacted with outrage, as did
many Jews.
   On Wednesday, Koch praised Jackson for his ``generosity of
spirit'' and both Democrats vowed they would work toward a Dukakis
victory in November. Koch promised he would never again attack
Jackson's or other politicians' integrity, but would limit his
fusillades to the issues.
   But Jackson's actions belied the upbeat words. At no point
during the news conference did the Democratic leader stand directly
beside Koch, and he kept a dour expression despite several attempts
at levity by the mayor.
   Jackson dismissed questions about his personal feelings toward
Koch, telling reporters, ``I bear no animosity in my heart toward
anyone.'' The black civil rights leader also said he never expected
an apology from Koch.
   ``I didn't request an apology. I don't need it, and the people
who felt it (anger against Koch) must be addressed,'' he said.
   Cuomo, who stood between the two as they entered the news
conference, said it was difficult for Koch and Jackson _ but
especially for Jackson _ to sit down and discuss a truce.
   ``This was a conscious effort to work on an agenda, not to
create a new relationship,'' said Cuomo, who praised the pair for
sending a ``wonderful, wonderful message'' to the nation.

<HEAD>Emigration Highest Since May 1980, Armenian Emigration Drops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union reached a
new eight-year high in August, with a total of 1,864 Jews allowed
to leave the country, the agency helping them resettle said today.
   But the number of Armenians permitted to emigrate from the
Soviet Union dropped to 223 in August from 1,018 in the previous
month, the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration said.
   Spokeswoman Regina Boucault had no explanation for the drop. She
said that so far this year 8,241 Armenians have been allowed to
leave.
   The Jewish emigres represented the eighth straight monthly
increase in the number of arrivals at the Vienna, Austria, transit
center, Ms. Boucault said. Only 116 emigres opted to go to Israel.
   The August figure was the highest since May 1980, when 1,976
Soviet Jews were allowed to emigrate, Ms. Boucault said. The
eight-month total for 1988 is now at 9,560 emigres, of whom 1,046
went to Israel.
   The largest official exodus, 51,330, was recorded in 1979 before
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West relations.
   Almost 270,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement
program started in 1971.

   A tribal court granted a non-Indian
couple permanent guardianship of a 13-month-old Navajo girl who had
lived with them since birth but was brought to the reservation by
Indian social workers.
   Wednesday's ruling, which settled a 4{-month dispute between the
tribe and the biological mother and foster parents of Allyssa
Kristian Keetso-Pitts, leaves the child with two mothers.
   ``I don't have any problems with that,'' a relieved Cheryl Pitts
said after Navajo Tribal Children's Court Judge Manuel Watchman
granted her and husband Rick Pitts permanent custody of Allyssa,
while maintaining the parental and visitation rights of the
biological mother, Patricia Keetso.
   Ms. Keetso, 22, a tribal member who has lived with the Pittses
in San Jose, Calif., since shortly before Allyssa's birth, said she
hoped her daughter would understand why she has two mothers.
   ``That's the most important thing; I didn't do this because I
don't love her. I did this because I love her so much. I just hope
she'll understand,'' Ms. Keetso said.
   While she was pregnant and unmarried, Ms. Keetso contacted the
Pittses about adoption through a newspaper advertisement. She said
she loves the Pittses and considers them as family.
   The case drew national attention in April when tribal social
workers took the girl, then 8{ months old, from the Pittses and Ms.
Keetso at San Jose's airport and brought the child back to the
reservation for three days.
   The Pittses originally sought outright adoption, but the tribe
intervened this year under the Indian Child Welfare Act, which
gives tribes jurisdiction over custody of Indian children in
adoption proceedings involving non-Indians.
   Watchman approved an April 22 agreement giving the Pittses
permanent guardianship and custody, a proposal supported by Ms.
Keetso and the child's grandparents, Susie and Howard Keetso.
   Under the agreement, the tribe will retain jurisdiction until
Allyssa is 18, when she can petition for adoption, Pitts said.
   Mrs. Pitts, 34, said Allyssa will retain her culture and receive
a Navajo census number as an official tribal member. ``We pretty
much all got what we all wanted. I'm so glad it's over. I feel
really happy that we can go home and be a normal family,'' she
said, her voice breaking.
   Pitts estimated that the legal proceedings surrounding Allyssa's
custody had cost him and his wife $23,000 to $25,000 in addition to
about $30,000 in lost business.
   But concerns over the couple's financial ability to support the
child, and the child's retaining her Navajo culture and heritage,
were satisfied by testimony at the hearing, Pitts said.
   Mrs. Pitts said she looked forward to ``not have to wake up
every morning and wonder if she (Allyssa) was going to be there or
not.''

<HEAD>United States Resettles More Than 12,300 Amerasians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A flight of 279 Amerasian children and
relatives arrived today from Vietnam, bringing to more than 12,300
the number the United States has taken for resettlement since 1982,
a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
   The flight arrived in Bangkok from Ho Chi Minh City, called
Saigon when it was the capital of the U.S.-backed South Vietnam
government, said spokesman Ross Petzing. A flight of 334 Amerasians
and relatives, the largest ever, landed here on Aug. 22, he said.
   The Amerasians were fathered by U.S. servicemen and civilians
during the war, which ended with the communist North Vietnamese
victory in April 1975. They have been emigrating to the United
States under the United Nations-sponsored Orderly Departure Program
since September 1982.
   Most of the children stay in Bangkok for a few days before going
to a U.S. refugee processing center in the Philippines for
English-language training and orientation to life in the United
States.
   Progress on humanitarian issues has been hampered by the lack of
diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.
   Official Radio Hanoi said Tuesday that Vietnam's Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach has told the United States that major
differences prevented resumption of talks on U.S. resettlement of
thousands of people who were detained in ``re-education camps''
because of their ties to the Americans during the Vietnam War.
   But Thach also announced that Vietnam was resuming cooperation
on joint efforts to find the remains of nearly 1,800 Americans
listed as missing in action, or MIA, in the war.
   Vietnam had suspended cooperation Aug. 3, complaining about what
it called America's ``hostile policy'' of isolating Vietnam to try
to force Hanoi's occupation troops out of Cambodia.
   A U.S. technical team will travel to Hanoi in September to work
out details for joint field survey and excavation activities in
Vietnam, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
Tuesday.
   She said a U.S. team also will visit Hanoi Sept. 5-8 to discuss
a plan to allow private American organizations to treat Vietnam
with war-related disabilities.

   Jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela, recuperating from tuberculosis, met today with the justice
minister after being transferred from a state hospital to a large
private clinic.
   Kobie Coetzee said Mandela's health ``appears to have improved
considerably'' and described conditions at the clinic as excellent.
The minister did not elaborate on his meeting with the 70-year-old
prisoner, whose release has been the focus of repeated
international campaigns.
   Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said he had expected the transfer
and did not view it as an indication the government has decided
whether it would free the African National Congress leader after
his recovery.
   Ayob said neither he nor Mandela's wife, Winnie, was told in
advance of the move from Cape Town's Tygerberg Hospital to the
Constantiaberg Clinic. Mandela was moved late Wednesday.
   Mandela, jailed since 1962, was transferred on Aug. 12 from
Pollsmoor Prison to Tygerberg, where doctors say he made a good
recovery following the drainage of fluid from his lungs.
   The clinic, which opened in March, is a 228-bed private hospital
with a view of the mountains overlooking Cape Town. It is a bit
more expensive than most South African hospitals, with private
rooms costing about $68 a day.
   The government will pay for his stay, as it would any prisoner.
   A prison spokesman, Danie Immelman, said Mandela's condition
``has improved to such an extent that his further treatment in the
Tygerberg Hospital was no longer necessary.''
   He gave no indication how long Mandela would be in the clinic or
what the conditions of his stay would be like.
   While there, Mandela is expected to have access to a greater
number of visitors than he had in prison and may even be allowed to
give interviews.
   Government officials have suggested Mandela would be moved to a
clinic and possibly allowed more visitors before a final decision
was made whether to release him outright.
   Mandela's full recuperation could take months. After that, the
government could send him back to prison or grant him freedom.
   President P.W. Botha, in a speech two weeks ago, said he was
seriously considering releasing Mandela, the country's best-known
black leader. Mandela is serving a life sentence for sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the white-led government.
   If Botha releases Mandela, the president risks an enormous white
backlash and the possibility of reactivating militant black
opposition that has been suppressed under a 26-month-old state of
emergency.
   However, there could be widespread unrest if the black
majority's most popular leader dies in custody.
   Botha has offered to release Mandela if he will renounce
violence. Mandela said he will do so only if the African National
Congress is no longer banned, apartheid is dismantled and blacks
are given full political rights.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow South
Africa's government and end apartheid, under which the black
majority has no voice in national affairs.
   Nationwide municipal elections are set for Oct. 26, further
complicating Botha's dilemma. The government is engaged in a
massive campaign to encourage blacks to vote in the township
elections but faces growing opposition from conservative whites.
   Mandela's release is likely to encourage black voters to go to
the polls but could harm Botha's National Party in the separate
white local elections.

   Horrified passengers aboard planes on
the runway watched struggling Delta Flight 1141 and cheered the
pilot, hoping to coax the troubled plane into the air.
   Thirteen people were killed when the Boeing 727 lifting off from
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport for Salt Lake City crashed
on takeoff, officials said. At least 94 people survived.
   Gene Metzig was aboard a commuter flight that had just landed
from Wichita Falls.
   ``His right wing was coming straight at us. It was probably no
more than a foot or 18 inches off the ground,'' Metzig said. ``As
he pulled it back to the left, I don't know how ... he missed us,
but he missed us.''
   Passengers on Metzig's plane egged on the Delta Air Lines pilot
as they watched the struggling jetliner.
   ``It was like a football game,'' Metzig said. ``We were cheering
this guy to get that plane off the ground. It was very emotional.
Plus, we were in danger of our own lives. We were rooting for that
pilot to get that plane up. But there was just no way.''.
   Rick Arnett, an Austin attorney, was also on a plane that had
just landed.
   ``A lot of people on the left side of our plane were saying `Get
up! Get up!' when they saw it coming in front of us,'' Arnett said.
   ``As the plane came up to take off, it was barely getting off
the ground and the right wing was dipping as it passed beyond us.
There were flames coming out of the right engine and the wing
touched the ground. The plane started spinning (and) there was an
explosion,'' he said.
   A motorist driving along the interstate said he watched in
disbelief when he saw the aircraft erupt in flames.
   ``I was coming over the bridge on I-30 in Arlington, and I saw a
big ball of fire going into the air,'' Greg Isaacs said. ``I
started driving over there and it looked like it was over near
D-FW, and I thought, `No way could it be an airplane accident.'''
   ``I could tell it was over near D-FW. It was an unbelievably big
explosion. I could not believe it _ I absolutely could not believe
it was that big an explosion,'' Isaacs said.
   The plane burst into flames and plowed into the dirt off a
north-south runway.
   David Hooker, 28, of Celina, was waiting at a gas station at the
south end of the airport when the plane crashed.
   ``I heard the normal noise of an airplane taking off. I turned
to watch and just barely saw the nose clear a building over
there,'' Hooker said, pointing to a low-level warehouse-type
building about a half-mile away.
   ``Then there was a cloud of smoke about three stories high and
an explosion,'' Hooker said.

<HEAD>Boat Owner Says He Urged Trainer to Halt Fatal Channel Swim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sailor accompanying a woman who died trying to
swim the English Channel said the athlete's trainer ignored his
advice to halt the swim, even though the woman was in obvious
distress, the Times of London said today.
   The newspaper quoted Colin Cook as blaming Judith Russo for the
Aug. 23 death of Renata Agondi, a fellow Brazilian.
   It quoted Ms. Russo's lawyer, Bernard-Charles Costenoble, as
saying the trainer denied that she refused to let Ms. Agondi
abandon the swim.
   Ms. Agondi, a 25-year-old Sao Paulo, resident described by the
Channel Swimming Association as a marathon swimmer of worldwide
status, died trying to swim from the southeast English port of
Dover to France.
   The Times said Cook, whose trawler was hired to accompany the
swim, told French police Ms. Agondi would not have died three miles
off France if Ms. Russo had heeded his advice.
   A French magistrate charged 51-year-old Ms. Russo on Friday with
``failing to assist a person in danger.'' The magistrate concluded
that Ms. Agondi was exhausted, which led her to drown.
   The Times quoted Cook as saying Ms. Agondi started out well but
became disoriented and didn't seem to know in which direction to
swim. Ms. Russo was supervising the swim from the trawler.
   ``We carried on a bit further but by now I was really worried
and thought it had to stop,'' the newspaper quoted Cook as saying.
``I looked over the side of the boat at the swimmer and I drew my
hand across my throat to tell her to finish the swim, but she took
no notice. The trainer assured me everything was all right.
   ``I realized that things were getting bad and dangerous. I was
so worried that I called the Dover Straits Coast Guard and said we
were having problems with the coach, to the point of being
detrimental to the girl's life.''
   Ms. Agondi finally was hauled onto the trawler, and an air force
helicopter picked her up. She was dead on arrival at a hospital in
the French port of Calais.
   The Times said French authorities released Ms. Russo from
custody Wednesday on $48,000 bond.
   It quoted Ms. Agondi's father, Raul Camara Agondi, as saying he
asked Ms. Russo to be his daughter's coach and accompany her on the
swim. It quoted him as saying: ``I don't believe Judith insisted
that Renata continue swimming.''
   Ms. Agondi was the fourth person known to have died trying to
swim the Channel since the first recorded swim by Matthew Webb, a
captain in the English merchant marine, on Aug. 24, 1875.
   The distance from Dover in a straight line to the nearest point
in France is 21 miles, but winds, tides and currents nearly always
add 10 miles or so to the distance for swimmers.

<HEAD>Execs Tried To Cover Up Defective Pacemakers, Prosecutors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical equipment company pleaded guilty to
selling thousands of defective pacemakers to doctors, knowing the
devices could stop working without warning, and four executives
were charged with the cover-up.
   The officers of The Cordis Corp. ignored internal memos urging
that doctors be informed about the defects and sent false
statements to the Food and Drug Administration to conceal the
problems, according to federal indictments returned Wednesday.
   Cordis, a Miami-based company that has since sold its heart
pacemaker division, pleaded guilty to concealing the defects in
federal court in a related action. The company said the plea covers
only Cordis, and not its officers at the time.
   The 43-count indictment against the officers said the problems
affected tens of thousands of the pacemakers sold between 1980 and
1985. The battery-powered devices are implanted beneath the skin of
heart patients to regulate their heartbeat by electrical impulses.
   Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Frank E. Young
stressed that the defective pacemakers have long since been the
subject of notifications to physicians, and are no longer on the
market. Prosecutors did not allege that anyone had died as a result
of the devices.
   One of the former officers, Harold Hershenson of San Carlos,
Calif., is accused of criminal conspiracy as well as 22 felony
counts and 10 misdemeanor counts of violating federal law.
   The indictment said Hershenson, the executive vice president who
ran the day-to-day operations of the company, rejected an internal
memo in 1981 urging Cordis to inform doctors of the pacemaker's
problems.
   Also charged was John Pagones of Coral Gables, a former vice
president who had direct responsibility for ensuring quality for
the pacemakers, and Dean Ciporkin of Miami and Stephen Vadas of
Homestead, both of whom worked for Pagones.
   If convicted, the four each face possiblity prison sentences
from 40 to 127 years and fines of more than $350,000.
   Calls to Hershenson's home were not returned Wednesday night,
but Pagones' attorney, Ted Klein, accused the government of
misrepresenting management decisions at the company.
   ``They assume these people intentionally put out a defective
product and it just isn't so. The evidence is going to show nobody
was injured,'' Klein said.
   The FDA said that most of the potentially defective pacemakers
were not removed and are being monitored by doctors, but some
patients highly dependent on the devices have had them removed by
surgery.
   ``Basically the defects were the sudden loss of the ability to
control the heartbeat _ the pacemakers were not pacing,'' said
Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office.
   Attorneys for Cordis entered guilty pleas to 11 felony and 13
misdemeanor counts before U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus. The
company agreed to pay $264,000 in fines and costs.
   The company reported net losses of $56.1 million in 1987, but
underwent a major restructuring since selling the pacemaker
operation to Telectronics of Australia. Net earnings for 1988
totaled $2.4 million on sales of $132 million.
   Cordis' main operations now include making catheters for
diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for monitoring
pressure on the brain.
   The case is ``the most significant felony prosecution to date''
under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the FDA law, said a
statement by Assistant Attorney General John R. Bolton, head of the
Justice Department's civil division in Washington, and by interim
Miami U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.

<TEXT>
   The United States resumed economic aid
to this African nation after a two-year break with a $17 million
package for agricultural development.
   The three-year agreement was signed in Harare Wednesday by
American Ambassador James W. Rawlings.
   Zimbabwe Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero called the aid ``a
giant step'' in strengthening relations between the two nations,
which for years have been plagued by political and ideological
feuds.
   U.S. aid was stopped in 1986 after a Zimbabwean Cabinet minister
attacked American policy toward South Africa while then-President
Jimmy Carter was vising Zimbabwe. Washington cut $13.5 million of
$20.5 million pledged for that year and subsequently did not renew
assistance.
   This southeast African nation has been one of the most strident
critics of President Reagan's refusal to support economic sanctions
against white-ruled South Africa. Zimbabwe has also criticized U.S.
aid to right-wing guerrillas in Afghanistan, Angola and Nicaragua.
   Black-led Zimbabwe was known as the British colony of Rhodesia
until it won its independence in 1980.
   Rawlings, who was appointed U.S. ambassador in 1986, said
Wednesday that the resumption of aid signaled American confidence
in Zimbabwe's economic potential and good will between the two
nations.
   Under the aid agreement, the U.S. government will sell American
farming equipment and spare parts to farmers and help to develop
agricultural programs.

<HEAD>Navy Cruiser Ends Tragedy-Marred Persian Gulf Assignment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. warship Vincennes begins its
13,000 journey home Sunday, ending a Persian Gulf assignment marred
by tragedy.
   The departure will represent the first cutback in American
forces in the gulf since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire.
   The 9,600-ton missile cruiser officially will be detached Sunday
from the Navy's Joint Task Force Middle East, Navy sources said.
Allowing for a month's sailing time and at least one port call en
route, the Vincennes should reach San Diego in mid-October.
   The departure ends the Vincennes' first combat zone assignment
since being christened at a Mississippi shipyard in 1984 by Marilyn
Quayle, wife of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the Republican nominee for
vice president.
   On July 3, the Vincennes crew shot down an Iranian civilian
jetliner over the Strait of Hormuz, killing all 290 aboard, after
mistaking the A300 Airbus for an attacking F-14 fighter.
   Pentagon officials attributed the blunder to crew stress in
combat but ruled out punitive action and said Iran shared the blame
by allowing the jetliner to fly over a skirmish between the
Vincennes and Iranian gunboats.
   While in the gulf region, the Vincennes also rescued five
Iranian fishermen adrift for eight days after their boat sank.
   Its withdrawal from the carrier battle group in the Arabian Sea
trims the American naval force in the region from 27 to 26 warships.
   The Pentagon says the U.S. fleet will be scaled back further if
the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, which took effect Aug. 20,
holds.
   But it has given no timetable, and other ships in the force are
still being replaced on schedule.
   U.S. officials said withdrawing the Vincennes was a gesture
toward reducing tensions.
   The Vincennes entered the gulf May 27, the first of the Navy's
billion-dollar Aegis cruisers assigned to the waterway.
   Some critics questioned the deployment of a floating powerhouse,
designed for long-range fleet defense, to the tight, congested
gulf. Even some of the ship's officers admitted they were less than
clear about their assignment.
   Senior U.S. officials said the Vincennes would greatly expand
air surveillance capability and offset an Iranian missile threat.
   Shortly after arriving, the cruiser was out of action for radar
system repairs. U.S. officials said the problem was unrelated to
the Airbus incident.
   The Vincennes later idled at anchor in Manama for another two
weeks while a U.S. team investigated the jetliner downing. It then
was reassigned to the Navy's carrier group in the Arabian Sea, and
did not return to the gulf.
   It also made a port visit to the Seychelles islands off the
African coast, the 385-member crew's first real liberty since the
Airbus tragedy.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Thin Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady in thin European trading
this morning as dealers predicted further improvement for the
American currency against the Japanese yen.
   Gold drifted higher in quiet trading.
   The yen has fallen since Bank of Japan officials hinted
Wednesday they would not raise their discount rate despite recent
interest rate hikes in the United States and Europe.
   A senior Bank of Japan official said today the Japanese
currency's movements since Wednesday were ``not a development that
requires immediate action.'' He described the yen's weakness as
``temporary.'' But he also said the bank may act to stop the yen's
fall if the bearish market persists.
   Dealers in Frankfurt said European traders were straining to
guess what the Bank of Japan would do about its falling currency.
   ``People are waiting for the Bank of Japan to step in anytime
soon but all they get is confusing messages,'' complained a dealer
at a major West German bank.
   One trader in Milan said he doubted the Bank of Japan would
raise its discount rate as long as the dollar was under 140 yen.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.73 yen to a closing 136.70 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 136.67 yen.
   But another Milan trader said dealers were slightly wary of
pushing the dollar too high against the yen for fear of central
bank intervention.
   ``The Japanese appear in no hurry for the moment to break the
dollar's rise against the yen,'' he said.
   The dealer stressed that market sentiment was still positive on
the dollar and said he expected dealers to buy dollars ahead of
Friday's release of the U.S. August employment figures.
   Other dollar rates in Europe at mid-morning, compared with late

   Here is a text of the statement Lech
Walesa released after his meeting with government officials:
   Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak met with Lech Walesa in Warsaw on Aug. 31,
1988. The talk was attended by Bishop Jerzy Dabrowski and Stanislaw
Ciosek (a secretary of the official national unity organization
PRON). Discussed were the premises for organizing a `roundtable'
meeting and the procedure of holding it.
   In the course of that meeting I raised the presently most
important problem of paths leading to the realization of union
pluralism including Solidarity's place.
   The partners (in the discussion) stated that all problems
connected with union movement will be discussed at the roundtable.
   The discussions of the roundtable will cover a broad range of
subjects of cooperation for the economic, social and political
reforms for the good of the country.
   In accordance with authorizations received from the striking
work crews I took over the issue of legalization of Solidarity, put
forward in strike postulates, for further talks with the central
authorities.
   I have thus decided that we now stop the strike actions. I
appeal to the inter-factory strike committees and factory strike
committees to appropriately end negotiations on other postulates
and to stop the strike.
   We remember about our slogan: there is no freedom without
Solidarity.

<TEXT>
   Vartan Gregorian, a scholar renowned for
his fund-raising skills as director of the New York Public Library,
has been named president of Brown University, the Ivy League school
announced.
   ``I come not to preside but to build,'' Gregorian said
Wednesday. ``The institution is full of potential, full of
greatness. Some of it has been achieved, some of it still has to be
achieved.''
   Gregorian's appointment as Brown's 16th president was announced
by Chancellor A.O. Way after a meeting of the Brown Corp.,
governing body of the 7,000-student university founded in 1764.
   ``Vartan Gregorian comes to the presidency with superb
credentials as scholar and administrator,'' said Way, who headed
the selection committee. ``He has an uncommon degree of energy and
good humor, ingredients vital to all successful presidencies.''
   Howard R. Swearer is stepping down as president in December.
Swearer, 56, announced his resignation for personal reasons in
October after 11 years as president.
   Gregorian, 54, a native of Iran, went to the New York library in
1981 from the University of Pennsylvania, where he was provost. He
used various fund-raising devices, including society parties, to
raise nearly $500 million during his tenure at the library.
   Gregorian admitted his fund-raising ability did not hurt his
candidacy for the Brown position, but said his ``primary obligation
will be to the academic welfare of the institution _ if that
requires organization of fund-raising'' so be it.
   He reportedly was wooed by a number of institutions. ``Brown is
small enough that you can leave an immediate impact,'' he said in
explaining his choice.

<TEXT>
   A Cuban who was sentenced to death as a CIA spy and
spent 27 years in prison as one of Fidel Castro's top prizes has
been reunited with his family.
   But the last thing Jose Pujals Mederos wanted to talk about
Wednesday was his experience as a political prisoner.
   ``We're just trying to enjoy this tremendous moment in our
lives,'' said his daughter, as Pujals joined his three children and
the seven grandchildren he'd never met in a celebration at his
son's Coral Springs home. ``Relatives have been coming in in
droves. It's wall to wall in here. More are on the way.''
   Pujals, a 63-year-old former farm manager, flew here Wednesday
in a chartered jet with his wife, Gloria Lizama Pujals, after being
freed from prison by the Cuban government. His family fought for
years for his release.
   ``We found it incredible,'' said his daughter, Gloria Pullen, 36.
   Pujals was in solitary confinement during much of his
imprisonment, said Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, who worked with the
Human Rights Project to win Pujals' freedom and appealed personally
to Castro for Pujals' release during a 1987 visit to Cuba.
   ``Actually, he looks pretty good for 63,'' said Mrs. Pullen, who
said her father was 36 when she saw him last. ``He looks like a
brother and he talks like an uncle. There's no mistake it's him.''
   Pujals was imprisoned on charges of attempting to overthrow
Castro's government, Bryant's office said.
   He was tried by a military tribunal shortly before the Bay of
Pigs invasion of 1962 and sentenced to death. The sentence later
was commuted to 30 years' imprisonment. Bryant's office said Pujals
was the No. 1 political prisoner in Cuba.
   ``We wrote letters to just about every president, influential
congressmen and senators, presidents of different countries,
religious leaders _ anybody who we thought could help,'' Mrs.
Pullen said.
   The Cuban government notified Bryant and the Human Rights
Project in May that it would release 50 prisoners, including Pujals.
   ``It's like a dream come true,'' Mrs. Pullen said.

<HEAD>Federal `Capscam' Sting Spread Money Through State Capitol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI sting companies and people linked
to their political corruption probe spread at least $56,000 in
political contributions around the California Capitol in the past
two years, finance reports show.
   Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, national chairman of Jesse
Jackson's presidential campaign, received $5,000 directly from two
firms identified as FBI fronts and $6,500 from another company with
ties to the sting.
   A $5,000 contribution from one of the FBI fronts was listed in
reports filed by Assembly Republican leader Pat Nolan of Glendale
before the corruption probe came to light.
   Nolan's attorney, Ephraim Margolin, said Nolan's campaign
reports would be amended to list another $5,000 contribution from
the FBI front.
   During the sweeping, two-year probe of legislative corruption,
the FBI sting companies reportedly offered payments in return for
votes on two bills drafted to give special bank loan benefits to
the bogus FBI firms.
   Terry Knowles, chief of the FBI's Sacramento office, said
Wednesday that he didn't expect the investigation to be concluded
until October at the earliest.
   ``We are working, I don't like to say around the clock, but full
days with a full squad,'' he said.
   In a related development, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported
Wednesday that Nolan's personal calendar for the night prior to the
date of those contributions listed a private dinner meeting in a
hotel room with a man now believed to be an FBI agent posing as an
out-of-state businessman seeking legislative favors.
   Reports filed with the secretary of state's office show that
Northern California Research Associates, a firm reportedly retained
by one of the dummy FBI companies, Gulf Shrimp Fisheries, gave
campaign contributions of $6,500 to Brown, the powerful Democratic
leader of the Legislature's lower house, and $3,500 to Democratic
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles.
   Two bills written by Moore to give special benefits to the phony
FBI companies are the focus of the ``Capscam'' scandal.
   Records at the secretary of state's office showed that Brown
also received a $4,000 contribution on May 26 from Peachstate
Capital and $1,000 from Gulf Shrimp in 1986.
   Peachstate and Gulf Shrimp have been identified as FBI front
companies by Donald Heller, an attorney for a legislative staffer
cooperating with federal agents. Federal and Capitol sources
confirmed Heller's statement.
   Brown spokeswoman Susan Jetton said the Peachstate contribution,
in the form of a cashier's check, was for four tickets to a large
fund-raising dinner, and that it was ``no big deal _ we didn't have
anything to do with them. ... It's not unusual that people who do
not have any connection (to the speaker) to come to these things.''
   Jetton also said the $6,500 contribution from NCRA in no way
linked the speaker to the investigation, adding, ``We're not going
to comment on anything that silly.''
   Regarding Moore's receipt of $3,500 from NCRA, Moore's
spokeswoman, Amy King, declined comment, and Nolan referred all
questions to his attorney, who said only that the facts would
vindicate the Republican leader.
   Gulf Shrimp and Peachstate were among bogus firms federal agents
set up in the probe of legislative corruption that came to light
with a late night search of Capitol offices by FBI agents last week.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army today removed nine
Pershing 2 missiles from a base in West Germany, the first step in
the withdrawal of all U.S. intermediate-range nuclear rockets from
Europe.
   The removal comes under the terms of an arms treaty signed by
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December.
   ``It's the first time that U.S. intermediate-range missiles have
been withdrawn in Europe,'' U.S. Navy Cmdr. Gerry Ryan of the
European Command Headquarters in Stuttgart told The Associated
Press.
   ``The remainder of the U.S. Army European-based,
intermediate-range nuclear missiles are scheduled to be removed
over a 36-month period,'' he said.
   A group of anti-nuclear activists who came to witness the
removal applauded as the 15 U.S. Army trucks bearing the missiles
began leaving the site in southern West Germany.
   The group held up a banner saying ``Heilbronn, Never Again A
Nuclear Powder Keg.''
   The nine Pershing 2 missiles had been deployed as part of a NATO
plan to station 572 intermediate-range nuclear missiles in five
West European countries to counter Soviet rockets pointed at the
West.
   The United States had stationed 108 Pershing 2 missiles and 96
cruise missiles at four bases in West Germany as part of the plan.
   Deployment of the missiles began late in 1983 and led to massive
protests in Western Europe, especially in West Germany.
   But the anti-missile fervor waned, and by the time the
intermediate-range missile treaty was signed last year only a
handful of protesters was still active on a daily basis in West
Germany.
   
   
   Ryan told the AP that a truck convoy carrying the missiles left
the Camp Redleg U.S. Army missile site near the southern city of
Heilbronn at about 10 a.m. today.
   Heilbronn is about 35 miles north of Stuttgart.
   One part of the convoy was heading to a U.S. Army post in
Frankfurt, while another part was heading to a different base ``in
preparation for air transport back to elimination sites in the
United States,'' Ryan said.
   U.S. officials have said that some of the rockets would be
destroyed at the Frankfurt site, and that the nuclear warheads
would be shipped back ``to the appropriate authority,'' in the
United States.
   Under terms of the INF traty, the Soviet Union and United States
agreed to eliminate all land-based intermediate-range nuclear
missiles, which have a range of up to 3,000 miles.

   Luu Quang Vu, a noted Vietnamese

this week, the official Vietnam News Agency said today. He was 40.
   The agency, monitored in Bangkok, said Vu's wife, poet Xuan
Quynh, and their 13-year-old son also died in the accident Monday
near the Vietnamese capital.
   ``Luu Quang Vu is author of many well-known plays which put him
at the fore of present-day Vietnamese dramatists,'' the agency said.
   Many of his works have been televised and his last play, a
comedy entitled ``Keeping Up Appearances,'' was being staged in
Hanoi, it said.
   No details were given on funeral arrangements.

   The government today asked a court to
reject Ferdinand Marcos' request to come home to face an accuser
and said it should be up to the United States whether the former
president can leave Hawaii.
   The anti-corruption court gave Marcos 10 days from receipt of
the transcript of today's proceedings to submit a written reply to
the government's motion to reject his petition.
   Court Clerk Luisabel Cortez said formal legal notice would be
forwarded to Marcos by the Philippine Consulate in Honolulu, where
he has lived since the February 1986 uprising that drove him from
power.
   Marcos petitioned the court to allow him to return to the
Philippines to confront a former Cabinet member scheduled to
testify in November on alleged corruption during his administration.
   President Corazon Aquino refused to allow Marcos to return,
citing national security. Mrs. Aquino said she would abide by the
decision of the courts if they allowed Marcos to come home.
   But last week she authorized Francisco Chavez, the
solicitor-general, to appeal to the Supreme Court if necessary to
block Marcos' return.
   Assistant Solicitor-General Romeo dela Cruz argued today that it
was up to the U.S. government to decide if Marcos could leave
Hawaii.
   ``If he cannot leave U.S. territory, it is not by an act of the
Philippine government but by an act of the U.S. government,'' dela
Cruz said. ``So it would be presumptuous of this court to interfere
with the affairs of a sovereign state.''
   U.S. officials have restricted Marcos to the island of Oahu
following attempts, allegedly instigated by him, to topple Mrs.
Aquino's government. U.S. officials said they would lift travel
restrictions on Marcos only with Mrs. Aquino's concurrence.
   Marcos filed the petition through his sister Fortuna Marcos
Barba on Aug. 24, one week after the anti-graft court granted the
solicitor general's request for a special hearing on the testimony
of former Public Works Secretary Baltazar Aquino.
   In its ruling, the court said Marcos had the right to defend
himself in the proceedings since the solicitor general had said he
intended to use Baltazar Aquino's testimony in a future criminal
suit against Marcos.
   Aquino, who is not related to the president, had served in
Marcos' Cabinet. According to government lawyers, he has agreed to
testify about millions of dollars in kickbacks Marcos allegedly
received from Japanese firms.

   Jesse Jackson today denied reports that aides to
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis had told him not to
campaign in several states.
   Asked whether he had been requested to stay out of certain
states, Jackson told ``CBS This Morning'', ``No, that never has
happened.''
   Sources close to Jackson had said Wednesday that the former
presidential candidate was angered at being told by Dukakis aides
to avoid campaigning in Michigan, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia,
Texas, New York and Alabama.
   ``I have no knowledge of that,'' he said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   ``I would assume there will be a lot of focus between now and
Labor Day _ the time is getting late _ to determine whether there
will be targeted states, where priorities will be,'' he said.
   An aide to Dukakis, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Wednesday the campaign had conducted polling in every state for
favorable and unfavorable opinions on Jackson ``to see how well he
can do in the fall in attracting swing voters as well as blacks.''
   The results showed that in some of the primary states he won,
Jackson had high negative reactions among swing voters, the Dukakis
aide said.
   In his remarks on NBC, Jackson said, ``Of course it would not be
a good thing'' if the Dukakis camp were to limit his campaign
activity in certain states, given the sometimes surprising success
of his vote-drawing efforts in the primary campaign.
   ``Suffice it to say I was able to gain votes and support and
build coalitions in every state,'' he said.
   Jackson had met with Dukakis aides in Washington last week and
was reported to have been angered by a suggestion he stay out of
several states. According to one participant in the discussions,
who asked not to be identified, the request was withdrawn.
   In Nashville, Tennessee State Rep. Roscoe Dixon of Memphis said
Jackson had invited him and other key supporters to a meeting today
in Atlanta. He said he did not know how many people have been
invited.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a former Jackson supporter who now is
co-chairman of Dukakis' Georgia campaign, said Wednesday night he
planned to attend the Atlanta meeting, which he said he understood
was called to discuss voter registration efforts in the South.

   A bus carrying 50 workers home from
a seaside holiday hit a load of bricks dropped on the road and
plunged into a reservoir, the Tanjug news agency said today. Thirty
people were reported killed.
   Tanjug said 14 people were hospitalized in Wednesday's crash
near Sarajevo.
   Most of the bus passengers were textile workers and their
families returning home from the Adriatic resort of Gradac, the
state-run agency said.
   The reservoir supplies a hydro-electric plant near Jablanica, 50
miles west of Sarajevo.
   Witnesses said a tractor-trailer truck swerved to the left side
of the road in a curve and skidded into the path of the bus. The
sideboard of the trailer opened and bricks fell out onto the road,
they said.
   Witnesses said the bus swerved to avoid the bricks, but hit some
of them and turned over once before plunging 50 yards into the
reservoir, Tanjug said. The driver of the truck reportedly left the
scene and was detained by police in a nearby town, Tanjug said. It
did not elaborate.
   Divers had recovered 19 bodies from the 60-foot-deep water by
noon and were expected to pull out 11 more by the end of the day.
   ``I was asleep when I felt a terrible crash and fell between the
seats,'' a survivor, Zoran Dencic, told reporters. ``I saw light
and manged to swim to the surface, he said.
   Another passenger, Svetlana Mosovski, said she was also asleep
at the time of the accident. ``I do not remember how I swam to the
surface,'' she said. She said she sat on one of the tires, but then
the bus began to sink.
   Rescue workers planned to partly drain the reservoir to aid the
divers, officials said.

<TEXT>
   An appeals court has thrown out murder
charges against three white lawmen in the death of a black inmate,
saying the indictments constituted double jeopardy.
   The three were acquitted in July of violating the civil rights
of Loyal Garner, who died in December of head injuries suffered in
the Sabine County Jail. Garner, 34, of Florien, La., had been
arrested on drunken driving charges.
   After the acquittal, prosecutors filed murder charges against
the three.
   Those charges, against Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner, 41,
and Sabine County Sheriff's deputies Bill R. Horton, 58, and James
M. ``Bo'' Hyden, 35, were dismissed Wednesday, said Barbara Holman,
an appeals court clerk.
   The appeals court accepted arguments that the indictments
amounted to double jeopardy, or prosecuting a defendant for the
same offense more than once. Double jeopardy is prohibited by the
U.S. Constitution.
   During the civil rights trial, Ladner admitted striking Garner
on the head once with a stick but said he used only force necessary
to subdue Garner after the inmate struck him in the head and neck.
   John Hannah, who was special prosecutor in the civil rights
case, has said he will seek federal indictments against the three
on charges of conspiracy to violate Garner's civil rights.

in Poland demanded to meet with Walesa before ending their strikes.
The workers were demanding higher wages and legalization of
Solidarity.
   As the shipyard workers in Gdansk marched toward the St.
Brygida's church, a crowd of supporters chanted, ``Thank you, thank
you'' and ``There is no freedom without Solidarity.'' The strikers
and the crowd sang the national anthem just before the shipyard
gates swung open.
   ``Every Pole is with us today,'' the crowd shouted in unison.
   The government welcomed Walesa's appeal to end the strikes, but
also announced that a policeman died while on duty inside the
strikebound Stalowa Wola steel mill in southeast Poland on
Wednesday night.
   ``It is not known if he was murdered or committed suicide under
psychological terror or persecution. I am awaiting results of the
investigation,'' government spokesman Jerzy Urban said today.
   Solidarity spokesman Piotr Niemczyk in Warsaw said strikers
reported that a policeman committed suicide by shooting himself,
but had no other details.
   In a breakthrough meeting with Walesa on Wednesday, senior
government officials promised talks on reinstating the banned free
trade union movement and jointly solving the country's daunting
social and economic problems.
   In exchange, the officials demanded an end to Poland's most
serious strike wave in seven years.
   Walesa won agreement to end the strikes from workers at the
Lenin shipyard and the separate Repair shipyard as well as the
Gdansk port after he went to all three facilities to deliver his
appeal.
   Upon his return to St. Brygida's church from the port, a buoyant
Walesa said jokingly, ``More than 100 percent,'' had supported his
appeal.
   Walesa's meeting with communist authorities Wednesday was his
first since they outlawed Solidarity in 1982. Previously, the
government had refused to treat him as anything more than a private
citizen.
   Seven other enterprises in Poland remained on strike today.
   Niemczyk said workers at the July Manifesto mine in southern
Poland said they would not end their occupation strike until local
issues of pay and work conditions are settled and until Walesa
visits the mine to explain his appeal.
   At the Stalowa Wola steel mill, management refused to give
strikers a copy of Walesa's post-meeting statement, delaying a
decision to end the strike there, Niemczyk said.
   A report on Polish radio at noon said talks between management
and strikers at Stalowa Wola started to discuss the ``technical
ending of the strike and the departure from the enterprise of
people taking part in it.''
   In an initial reaction to Walesa's statement, strike leaders in
Szczecin, the country's other main Baltic port, said they would not
automatically end their strike while local grievances were still
pending, he said.
   The labor unrest began Aug. 16 at the July Manifesto mine. At
its peak, the strike wave has affected 20 enterprises employing
about 100,000 workers.
   The strikers demanded higher wages and legalization of
Solidarity, which was crushed in a Dec. 13, 1981 military crackdown.
   After meeting Wednesday with Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak
and Stanislaw Ciosek, an alternate member of the communist party's
ruling Politburo, Walesa said: ``I raised the presently most
important problem of paths leading to trade union pluralism,
including Solidarity's place.
   ``The partners (in the discussion) stated that all problems
connected with the union movement would be discussed at the round
table,'' he said. ``I have thus decided that we now stop the strike
actions.''
   Walesa also said the government agreed to discuss broad
political and economic issues at the round table, to be convened in
the near future.
   His statement was sent to strikers nationwide and read to
reporters in Gdansk.
   The state-run news agency PAP, in a short dispatch on the
session, said the parties discussed ``the premises for organizing a
`round-table' meeting and the procedure for holding it.''
   After the talks in Warsaw, Walesa went straight to the Lenin
shipyard, where he is employed as an electrician, to explain his
appeal.
   ``It is a difficult decision because there are no written
guarantees,'' said Walesa aide Piotr Konopka.
   Walesa's talks with the officials came on the eighth anniversary
of the signing at the Gdansk shipyard of the 1980 accords that for
the first time guaranteed free trade union rights in a Soviet bloc
country.
   Walesa, Kiszczak, Ciosek and Bishop Jerzy Dabrowski of Warsaw
met for three hours in a government villa in Warsaw.
   Andrzej Stelmachowski, a prominent intellectual trusted by both
the authorities and Solidarity, helped arrange Wednesday's meeting.
   Afterward, he said it represented the beginning of a process to
resolve problems that include 60 percent inflation and the failure
of wages to keep pace with increases in government-controlled
prices.
   Walesa said the talks to bring about ``Solidarity-related union
organizations'' would require ``patient negotiations which have to
take a certain time.''
   The problem of trade unions, the right to form associations, and
the role of other groups in the government's reform programs would
be the round tables' main subjects, said Stelmachowski.

   Police detained a Jewish West Bank settler
after he accidentally shot and wounded two Israeli soldiers while
chasing a Palestinian who hurled a firebomb at his car, officials
said.
   ``He thought they (the soldiers) were terrorists coming to kill
him,'' said David Bedein, a spokesman for Jewish settlements in the
area.
   The shooting Wednesday night highlighted the growing controversy
over the use of force by Israeli civilians against Palestinians who
throw stones and firebombs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Stip.
   Military officials said that in the past few days settlers have
come close to hitting Israeli soldiers several times when they
opened fire in the occupied territories.
   Also Wednesday, two Palestinians were killed in separate clashes
with troops, Arab doctors and media reports said. A third
Palestinian died of wounds sustained in an earlier clash.
   The fatalities brought to 258 the number of Arabs killed since
the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising against 21 years of
Israeli occupation. Four Israelis have also died.
   In other developments:
   _A battalion of 170 armored corps soldiers ending reserve duty
in the West Bank signed a petition urging the army to allow
soldiers to shoot more freely at Palestinian demonstrators.
   ``That way we won't come to the point where soldiers are
humiliated in front of the rioters,'' tank commander Gad Shlafkin
told Israel radio. ``The trouble now is that the troops are not
given the means to act properly.''
   _Three Supreme Court judges visited the Ketziot tent-prison in
the Negev desert to investigate prison conditions after former
inmates complained to the Supreme Court.
   Israel radio said 2,700 Palestinians are jailed at Ketziot.
Palestinians have complained of poor food, stifling heat and
allegedly humiliating treatment at the prison.
   In Wednesday's shooting, Gedalia Becker accidently shot the
soldiers near the Jewish settlement of Efrat, about 10 miles south
of Jerusalem, as he chased the Palestinian who aimed the firebomb
at his car, an army official said
   He said the soldiers were also pursuing the Palestinian.
   An army investigation indicated Becker opened fire even though
his life was not in danger, Israel radio said. The firebomb
exploded 20 yards behind Becker's car and he fired 11 bullets from
his pistol, the radio reported.
   Becker, a resident of the Maalei Amos settlement, was released
after several hours of questioning, but police confiscated his
pistol, the radio said.
   The soldiers were hospitalized, one with moderate and the other
with slight wounds, the army official said.
   Dov Kenan, head of the area's Gush Etzion settlement council,
expressed ``deep regret'' about the shooting, which came a day
after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told West Bank settlers he
favored fewer restrictions on the use of self-defensive measures by
Israeli civilians and troops.
   In Gaza's Shati refugee camp on Wednesday, troops opened fire to
disperse Arab stone-throwers, fatally shooting 17-year-old Hamis Al
Minawi in the heart, said doctors at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital.
   Five Shati residents were wounded, including a 40-year-old woman
shot in the head, the doctors said.
   The army said it was checking the circumstances of the death.
The army official confirmed four Palestinians were wounded by
troops.
   Israeli media reports, citing Arab sources, said troops also
shot to death a 22-year-old Arab man in a clash with Palestinians
who hurled rocks, bottles and bricks at soldiers making arrests in
the West Bank village of Deir Ghassani. The army said it had no
report of the shooting.

<TEXT>
   Office workers in small boats and
banana-plant rafts sailed to work through flooded streets in the
capital today as the Buriganga River reached its highest level in
34 years.
   At least 680 people have died since the floods started in June
with the annual monsoon season, according to several Dhaka
newspapers.
   President Hussain Mohammad Ershad said on Wednesday the death
toll was 250, but the government's count usually is considered low.
   Dhaka, a city of 4 million, is virtually cut off from the rest
of the country. The Ministry of Communications said 18 highways
leading out of the capital were closed to traffic because of
flooding.
   One-fourth of the city was under water ranging from a few inches
to several feet. No deaths have been reported in Dhaka.
   Most of the flooding was in poor and middle-class neighborhoods,
but by today the water had started seeping into the districts of
Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara on Dhaka's northeast side, where
foreign diplomats and wealthy Bangladeshis live.
   The small Bengali-language Khabar newspaper said a boat carrying
100 flood refugees sank Wednesday in the Brahmaputra River 70 miles
north of Dhaka and all aboard were feared drowned. There was no
confirmation of the report.
   Police in Dhaka said they could not confirm the sinking, which
was reported by none of the major newspapers. Telephone lines were
out to Mymensingh, the town nearest the reported sinking.
   The Buriganga reached a danger level of 23 feet, 3 inches
Wednesday night, according to the Flood Forecast and Warning Center.
   The river, a tributary of the Ganges, has risen steadily as
waters from the already flooded north of the country surge
downstream toward the Bay of Bengal.
   ``I had to take a boat ride to come to work,'' Abdul Jabbar, a
government clerk said.
   He said his house in Swamibagh on Dhaka's southern outskirts was
under five feet of water. His family took refuge on the upper floor
of a nearby two-story building.
   Carpenters worked throughout the night building small boats to
transport people. Some people improvised rafts from banana plant
stalks and leaves.
   On Wednesday, Ershad issued an international appeal for aid,
including food, helicopters and rafts. He said his impoverished
nation, where the per capita income is $150 a year, needed 2
million tons of grain to face the emergency.
   Last year, floods killed more than 1,500 people in Bangladesh.
In 1985, more than 10,000 drowned when cyclones and tidal waves
swept over low-lying islands in the Bay of Bengal.
   ``The flooding has made me a pauper, and my shop is closed for
business,'' Abdul Ahad, a grocer, said. He said nearly all his
merchandise, including bags of rice stored in his home, was ruined
when flood waters entered the building overnight.

<HEAD>IRA Suspects Linked to Bombings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARLSRUHE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two alleged IRA members captured
this week are prime suspects in recent bombings of British military
installations in West Germany, authorities said today.
   Authorities also said the men were caught with a weapon believed
to have been used in a shootout in the Netherlands that killed a
Royal Air Force member in May.
   An arrest warrant issued late Wednesday says the two men are
``urgently suspected'' of taking part in two bombings and an
attempted murder in West Germany, the federal prosecutor's office
said.
   The warrant was issued after a federal court hearing in
Karlsruhe, the prosecutor's spokesman, Alexander Prechtel, said in
a telephone interview.
   Under West German law, issuance of a arrest warrant means the
two men may be held indefinitely in investigative custody until
they are formally charged.
   The suspects are being held at a maximum security prison,
Prechtel said. He declined to give the location of the prison.
   Prechtel identified the suspects as Gerard Thomas Hanratty and
Terence Gerard McGeough, both 29.
   They were arrested late Tuesday after crossing the Dutch border
into West Germany near the town of Waldfeucht. British military
installations are near the town, 45 miles northwest of Cologne.
   Police found two Kalashnikov AK-47 automatic rifles and three
.38-caliber pistols in their car, Prechtel said.
   ``Ballistics experts believe that one of the rifles found in the
car is the same one used in the July 13 attack on the British army
barracks in Duisburg and in the May 1 shooting of a British soldier
in the Netherlands,'' Prechtel said.
   On May 1, three Royal Air Force members were fired on from
point-blank range in the southern Dutch city of Roermond. One
airman died instantly and his two colleagues were injured.
   On July 13, two bombs planted by the IRA exploded at the
Duisburg barracks, injuring nine soldiers. At about the same time,
shots were fired from a passing automobile at a police car in the
same area.
   Other evidence links the men to an IRA bombing on Aug. 5 at a
British Army barracks in Duesseldorf, Prechtel said. Three British
soldiers and a civilian were injured in that attack.
   The suspects were arrested while driving a Peugeot 305 car
rented in Mainz, 27 miles west of Frankfurt, where they also rented
a car from Aug. 3 to Aug. 8, said Prechtel.
   The arrest warrant also says the two are suspected of illegal
possession of weapons and falsifying documents, Prechtel said.
   ``Hanratty was arrested with a falsified British passport and a
driver's license,'' Prechtel said. No documents were found on
McGeough.
   Hanratty said he was born in Belfast on Jan. 26, 1959. McGeough
said he was born in Carry Castle on Sep. 2, 1958. The two men gave
the court no further information, Prechtel said.
   ``We are reasonably sure that these are their correct
identities,'' Prechtel said.
   The men also were found with seven full magazines for the
rifles, one empty magazine, Irish money and Dutch license plates,
Prechtel said.

   A retired surgeon saved his
life by diagnosing his own imminent heart attack and hurrying to a
hospital before his heart stopped, a newspaper reported today.
   The Star said Dr. Daniel du Plessis, former head of surgery at
the University of the Witwatersrand medical school, was given
life-saving shock treatment after his heart stopped while he was
being examined at Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg.
   The Star said du Plessis, 70, became convinced he was about to
have a heart attack when he felt twinges in his chest while driving
back to Johannesburg on Sunday after a weekend trip with his wife.
   Du Plessis reportedly rejected his wife's suggestion that he
relax and have a cup of tea. Instead, said The Star, he arranged to
meet a colleague at the hospital and was being examined in the
intensive care unit when his heart stopped.
   The hospital said today that du Plessis recovered well and has
been released.

<TEXT>
   The Boston Symphony Orchestra didn't violate
Vanessa Redgrave's civil rights when it canceled her performances
after receiving threats of protest over the actress' pro-PLO views,
a U.S. appeals court ruled.
   The decision by the full 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed an earlier finding by a three-member panel of the court
that the orchestra had violated the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.
   The 3-2 ruling Wednesday upheld the First Amendment right of the
orchestra to cancel the performances because of concern over their
artistic integrity.
   ``We have no reason to think that the Massachusetts Legislature
enacted the MCRA in an attempt to have its courts, at the
insistence of private plaintiffs, oversee the editorial judgments
of newspapers, the speech-related activities of private
universities, or the aesthetic judgments of artists,'' said Judge
Frank M. Coffin, writing for the majority.
   However, the court reinstated an award of $12,000 that Ms.
Redgrave would have earned in a Broadway role she lost during the
suit against the symphony.
   Symphony officials were relieved by the ruling, said BSO
attorney Bob Sullivan. ``They can go back to doing what they're
best at _ making music,'' he said.
   Attorneys for Ms. Redgrave, Daniel J. Kornstein and Marvin
Wexler, did not immediately return calls.
   Ms. Redgrave was hired by the symphony in 1982 to narrate six
performances of Stravinsky's ``Oedipus Rex'' at Boston, at
Tanglewood in western Massachusetts and at New York's Carnegie Hall.
   The symphony canceled the contract after it received letters and
phone calls indicating there would be picketing and other protests
because of Ms. Redgrave's support of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The symphony argued that Massachusetts law allowed it to cancel
performances because of concern that disruptions would mar their
artistic integrity.
   In 1984, a federal jury ruled the symphony breached its contract
with Ms. Redgrave and awarded her the $27,500 she was to have
received plus $100,000 for work Ms. Redgrave said she lost because
of the cancellation.
   A federal judge out the $100,000 award in 1985 and ruled the
symphony had not violated Ms. Redgrave's civil rights. In October,
the three-member appeals panel restored $12,000 of that award but
agreed that her rights had not been violated.

   IRA supporters burned cars,
hurled rocks and gasoline bombs and fired on a police station in
Belfast today to protest the slaying by British soldiers of three
IRA guerrillas, police said.
   Three people were injured in the rioting, and security forces
fired a number of plastic bullets during a flare-up of rioting
shortly before noon on the Falls Road in mainly Roman Catholic west
Belfast, police said.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in a newspaper interview
that increased IRA attacks only made her more determined to keep
Northern Ireland under British rule.
   West German authorities today said two alleged IRA members
captured near the Dutch border are prime suspects in recent
bombings of British military installations in West Germany.
   The men were caught Wednesday with a weapon believed to have
been used in a shootout in the Netherlands that killed a Royal Air
Force member in May, they said.
   British newspapers hailed as major setbacks to the IRA the
slaying of the three guerrillas Tuesday, the arrests Wednesday of
the two IRA suspects in West Germany, and Wednesday's admitted IRA
blunder in which two civilians died in a bomb blast meant for
British security forces.
   ``Blows on three fronts for the IRA,'' The Times of London
headline read.
   Belfast police headquarters said rioting broke out in Catholic
areas of Belfast late Wednesday, continued into early today and
died out before dawn.
   It said gangs of young IRA supporters set a bus, two vans and
more than 35 cars on fire and hurled gasoline bombs and rocks at
security forces, while a gunman opened fire on the city's New
Barnsley police station.
   The statement said police found a machine gun, a pistol and
ammunition in a search of an empty house in Catholic west Belfast.
   It said a bomb planted by a masked man exploded near a gas
station at Strabane on the border with the Irish Republic, 60 miles
west of Belfast, but that nobody was reported injured.
   ``Stepping up their campaigns and their attacks strengthens the
resolve of the British government that Northern Ireland is part of
the United Kingdom and will remain so,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in an
interview published today in London's Daily Express.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting to drive the British from
the mainly Protestant province and unite it with the prodominantly
Roman Catholic Irish Republic. It has recently increased attacks
and is blamed for the deaths this year of 27 security force
personnel in Northern Ireland, mainland Britain and the European
mainland.
   ``When you are faced with terrorism, you obviously do not let
the terrorists know precisely what steps you are taking to counter
their terrorism. Nor shall we. But my message to them is this: Do
not doubt our resolve to defeat terrorism,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey's government in Dublin called for
an urgent meeting with British officials under terms of the
Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gives Dublin a formal consultative
role in the running of Northern Ireland.
   ``The frightening escalation of violence undermines the very
maintenance of the rule of law,'' his government said.
   Police said the bomb that exploded Wednesday in an apartment in
Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second-largest city, was intended
for British security forces but was accidentally triggered by an
elderly Catholic man. He and an elderly Catholic woman died in the
blast.
   The IRA has killed 20 civilians accidentally since November and
has apologized each time.
   On Tuesday, British soldiers in Northern Ireland, 50 miles west
of Belfast, shot to death three IRA members. The IRA said the slain
guerrillas were on ``active service,'' the IRA term for a guerrilla
mission.
   Police said the three were armed and dressed for a possible
attack.

   A new poll shows Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis running neck and neck in his home state with Republican
opponent George Bush, less than two years after Dukakis won
re-election by a landslide.
   The poll, published today in the Boston Herald, found the
Democratic and Republican presidential nominees tied at 42 percent
each with 15 percent undecided. The poll of 400 likely voters,
taken Wednesday, had a 5 percent margin of error.
   A poll taken in July for the Herald and WBZ-TV found Dukakis
leading Bush by 14 percentage points, 51 percent to 37 percent.
   ``One would have thought Dukakis would have held onto a big lead
in his home state,'' KRC pollster Gerry Chervinsky told the Herald.
   In the Herald poll, Dukakis was viewed favorably by 51 percent
of the respondents and unfavorably by 34 percent. Bush's
favorable-unfavorable ratio was 48-37 percent.
   Chervinsky said that last February, shortly after Dukakis won
the New Hampshire primary, Dukakis had a 79-14
favorable-unfavorable ratio.
   In the new Herald poll, 49 percent thought Dukakis should remain
in office pending the election, and 40 percent thought he should
resign now.
   That poll also found that 56 percent thought Dukakis had not
been an effective governor while campaigning for the presidency,
and 33 percent thought he had been.

   Astronauts preparing for the first
post-Challenger shuttle mission adjusted a stuck piece of satellite
launch equipment and solved other simulated problems during a dress
rehearsal.
   The five astronauts were expected to confront about 150
simulated problems during the 56-hour rehearsal, which began
Tuesday and was to end this afternoon. The drill also involves
about 300 people at NASA's Johnson Space Center.
   ``They just keep throwing out one thing after another and they

spokeswoman Barbara Selby said.
   Commander Rick Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and mission
specialists David Hilmers, Mike Lounge and George ``Pinky'' Nelson
will fly aboard Discovery on a four-day mission.
   On Wednesday, Nelson and Lounge went outside the orbiter to fix
a stuck tilt-table needed to deploy a $100 million communications
satellite. That simulation was done in a water tank, Ms. Selby said.
   Discovery's mission will be the first shuttle flight since the
Challenger explosion 2{ years ago. The launch is slated for late
September or early October if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen
leak are repaired in time.

<HEAD>Audi Will Not Settle in Acceleration Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Audi of America Inc., having failed to reach a
settlement of a lawsuit alleging its Audi 5000 is prone to sudden,
unintended acceleration, says it has no choice now but to defend
itself in court.
   The class-action lawsuit was filed on behalf of some 390,000
Audi owners.
   In June, attorneys for both sides announced a settlement that
would have given each owner a credit of between $300 and $2,000
toward the purchase of a new Audi.
   But on Aug. 11, Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas R. Rakowski
rejected the settlement because it would have forced owners to buy
another Audi to benefit.
   On Wednesday, Audi attorneys informed the judge that the
automaker, a Troy, Mich.-based subsidiary of Volkswagen of America,
would fight the suit in court.
   ``We're kind of back to the wall. We have to defend (the car),''
Audi spokesman Joseph Bennett said in a telephone interview. ``We
were looking for possible solutions to this and couldn't come up
with anything.''
   The Audi 5000 owners contend the cars surge forward or backward
when shifted into gear. Audi vehemently denies there is anything
wrong with the cars.
   Mark Steinbach, a Washington attorney who represents an
organization of disgruntled Audi owners, said the rejected
settlement would not have cost Audi anything and ``would have
represented a bonanza in terms of sales.''
   The Center for Auto Safety in Washington contends 402 people
have been injured and five killed in at least 1,650 accidents
blamed on unintended acceleration by the Audi 5000.

   An underground electrical fire caused a 40-block
power outage downtown, sending many workers home early, and utility
officials said they couldn't start working on repairs until this
morning.
   Power was not expected to be restored to some areas until
tonight, according to Seattle City Light spokesman Hugh McIntosh.
   City Light crews scrambled today to locate and deploy generators
for some hotels and buildings that house mostly poor, elderly
people, he said.
   About 95 percent of the major buildings in the area have at
least some auxiliary power supply, officials said.
   The affected area included the downtown retail, financial and
hotel center, along with some residences. Long-distance phone
service also was disrupted for some customers.
   The number of affected residents, businesses and hotels was
undetermined, since many establishments continued operating using
backup generators.
   Fourteen officers were added to the usual 10 on patrol in the
blacked-out area overnight, and no looting was reported, Officer
Steven Thomas said early today.
   Fifty-five additional police officers patrolled and directed
rush-hour traffic on Wednesday, Fire Marshal B.L. Hansen said.
   City Light officials said it was the worst outage the
municipally owned utility had experienced, eclipsing an 80-block
downtown blackout that lasted five hours in 1966.
   A total of 3,000 feet of cable had to be replaced and work
couldn't begin on repairs until this morning, according to
spokeswoman Dorothy Nelsen.
   ``This could cost me $5,000 to $10,000,'' said Mike McAlpin,
owner of Mama's Mexican Kitchen.
   Others fared better. David Sivinski, proprietor of a
propane-powered popcorn wagon, said his booming business
represented ``the revenge of low-tech.''
   Fears of a toxic chemical release proved unfounded when it was
determined that no transformers ruptured during the fire, easing
concern that oil containing potentially dangerous PCBs had burned,
McIntosh said.
   Firefighters originally thought transformer oil was burning when
they saw black smoke, said Fire Department spokesman Roy Davis.
They learned it was the plastic insulation around the transformers
that ignited, McIntosh said.
   The fire was confined to the underground vault. Firefighters
took two hours to extinguish it by filling the chamber with carbon
dioxide. No injuries were reported.
   The loss of power and long-distance phone service prompted some
businesses to send employees home early. But mass evacuations were
avoided because so many major buildings in the area switched to
their backup systems.
   Two window washers, stuck on an electrically powered scaffold
outside the 14th floor of a building, lowered themselves by hand on
a bosun's chair, drawing applause from spectators.
   The Claremont Hotel was evacuated because of heavy smoke
emanating from manholes in the street. The Bon Marche department
store also was evacuated because a backup power system failed, said
a woman who answered the telephone there and identified herself as
an employee.
   The Warwick Hotel distributed 150 flashlights to its guests,
said Cyndy Sparhawk, the hotel's sales director.
   Auxiliary power meant Warwick guests had elevator service, hot
and cold water and hall lights Wednesday night, but room lights
will be out until the power service is restored, said Kevin Klein,
a front office assistant manager.
   Jerry Wolsborn, managing director of the 865-room Westin Hotel,
said emergency lighting and one elevator in each of the hotel's two
high-rise towers were sustained with backup systems.
   U S West Communications, the regional phone company, restored
its long-distance phone service by Wednesday evening, and was
trying to provide emergency generator power for other long-distance
carriers, said spokesman Vic Kucera.

   Iran accused Iraq today of taking 752
Iranian troops prisoner in the past 10 days, and Baghdad charged
Tehran with stalling peace talks in an effort to rebuild its
flagging army.
   As the two sides continued to trade accusations of numerous
cease-fire violations, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said he was frustrated by the slow pace of peace talks in
Geneva.
   Official Tehran radio said the 752 Iranians were taken prisoner
since a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire went into effect Aug. 20. The
official Islamic Republic News Agency said Wednesday that 700
Iranians had been captured.
   In Baghdad, the government-run Ath-Thawra newspaper said Iran
was stalling peace talks to disguise its attempt to rebuild its
forces.
   The Iranian government ``is seeking to improve its international
stand and be in a better situation to renew the war, forgetting
that the decisive factor which prompted it to accept the
(cease-fire) was the final defeat that afflicted Iran,'' the paper
said in an editorial.
   Peace talks have hit a snag over Iraq's demand to have the
disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway immediately cleared of sunken
tankers. Iraq also has demanded sovereignty of the waterway, its
only outlet to the sea.
   Iran says a permanent cease-fire and troop withdrawal must come
before the waterway is cleared.
   Iraqi newspapers lashed out at Iran today for its insistence on
reviving the 1975 Algiers Treaty between the two countries as a
basis for a peace settlement. The treaty divided the disputed
waterway between the two sides.
   ``The (Algiers) agreement is an issue of history,'' said the
state-run Al-Jomhouriya. ``It has become meaningless and there is
no justification whatsoever to revive it.''
   In other reports of violations, Tehran radio said Iraq fired 20
artillery shells Wednesday into Oshnavieh in the north, and that
Iraqi troops later moved inside Iran from their bases across the
border. No casualties were reported.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, also charged Iraq with
capturing four villages, firing shots and operating military trucks
close to the warfront over the past three days.
   Iraq, meanwhile, charged Iran with setting up observation posts
and bunkers, moving troops close to the border and launching
gunboats into the Shatt-al-Arab.
   U.N. observers monitoring the truce have not reported any
serious violations by either side.
   In another development today, the Islamic Republic News Agency
said 900 Kurdish families fleeing Iraqi air raids had arrived in
northwestern Iran.
   The refugees _ elderly men, women and children _ were being
settled temporarily in the towns of Piranshahr and Orumieh in West
Azarbaijan province, said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   The report said 300 of the families arrived from Turkey while
the rest came directly from Iraq, fleeing shelling and chemical
weapons. It did not specify the number of people involved.
   Diplomats in Baghdad say Iraq has taken advantage of the Aug. 20
cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old Persian Gulf war to intensify
operations against the Kurds who want autonomy and who sided with
the Iranians in the war.
   In Ankara, Turkey, Premier Turgut Ozal said today that 60,000
Kurdish refugees had fled into the country since it opened its
border two weeks ago. He said preparations were under way for
housing the refugees.

   David Letterman apologized to the city of
Pittsburgh for a crack about the death of Pittsburgh Steelers
founder Art Rooney Sr.
   ``It's terribly sad, and there's a little controversy
surrounding this because he died during the exhibition season. So
does it count?'' the host of NBC's ``Late Night With David
Letterman'' said during Tuesday's show.
   Members of the studio audience groaned at the joke, said
Letterman publicist Peter Spivey in New York.
   The apology, made during Wednesday night's show, was directed at
the people of Pittsburgh, Spivey said.
   ``It was poor judgment,'' Letterman said. ``My heartfelt
apologies to them.''
   Rooney, who died Aug. 25 at age 87, built the Steelers into a
National Football League powerhouse during the 1970s and was
beloved in Pittsburgh.
   NBC affiliate WPXI-TV said it received calls complaining about
the joke. During the station's newscast Wednesday, offended viewers
were told to call NBC headquarters in New York.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush today staged a quick
campaign raid into Michael Dukakis' home state in a bid to raise
doubts about the Democratic presidential candidate's environmental
record, accusing him of delay while the Boston harbor got ``dirtier
and dirtier.''
   ``Two hundreds years ago tea was spilled in the Boston harbor in
the name of liberty,'' he said in a statement prepared for delivery
after a boat tour of the polluted harbor. ``If tea were spilled in
the Boston harbor today it would dissolve in the residue of my
opponent's neglect and delay.''
   Bush was greeted in the harbor by about 70 Dukakis supporters
who chanted ``Where was George?'' _ a refrain from the Democratic
convention.
   Bush said Dukakis as governor had ``twice fought to avoid making
it cleaner.'' He asserted that Dukakis had sought permission from
former Environmental Protection Agency administrator William
Ruckelshaus to delay a ban on dumping wastes in the harbor.
   Dukakis in his first term drafted papers seeking the delay but
it was his succesor, Ed King, who actually filed the delay request
to Ruckelshaus in 1979.
   ``The stealth candidate is at it again, making promises on one
hand but hiding his secret record on the other,'' Bush said.
   The vice president noted that Dukakis has visited the New Jersey
coast and spoken of his concern over the pollution along the shore.
``What he didn't tell them is this. The Dukakis administration had
applied in 1985 for a permit to dump Massachusetts sewage sludge
off the New Jersey coast,'' he said.
   In December 1985, Dukakis sought temporary permission from EPA
to dump sludge at a site 106 miles off the New Jersey coast, where
New Jersey and New York already were dumping sludge. A compromise
allowed Massachusetts to dump it farther away, at a deep-water site
beyond the continental shelf.
   Today was the second of a three-day campaign swing devoted to
the environment.
   ``Our land, water and soil support a remarkable range of human
activities,'' the vice president said Wednesday in a speech in
Michigan that aides said was designed to demonstrate a greater
commitment to environmental cleanup than the Reagan administration
has exhibited. ``But they can only take so much. We must remember
to treat them not as a given, but as a gift.''
   Bush pledged in a visit to a park on the shores of Lake Erie
that he would support establishment of a ``set timetable'' for
reduction of acid rain pollution, with the details to be worked out
with Congress. He also said he would convene an international
conference during his first year in the White House for a
discussion of the ``greenhouse effect'' that threatens a change in
the earth's climate because of gradually rising temperatures.
   Dukakis sought to tout his own record on environmental matters
earlier this summer when he broke ground for a cleanup effort of
the harbor, but his critics complained he should have recognized
the problem years ago.
   Bush drew a few critics of his own on Wednesday with his
environmental speech.
   Taking Bush to task for calling himself an environmentalist,
Blake Early of the Sierra Club said, ``We haven't seen it in his
record, so it comes as a revelation to us.''
   ``For George Bush to come here and present himself as an
environmentalist, it's like Bonnie and Clyde coming out for gun
control,'' former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts said.
   But Bush had the stage all to himself in Michigan on Wednesday,
first making his environmental speech and later paying a visit to
the Michigan State Fair in Detroit.
   Earlier, in his visit to the park on the shore of Lake Erie,
Bush said, ``I am an environmentalist, always have been, from my
earliest days growing up and then as a congressman. ... And I
always will be, to my last days as president of this great and
beautiful country.''
   He did not mention President Reagan by name, but aides said his
call for tougher steps against acid rain was designed to illustrate
a tougher approach than the current administration.
   ``On the question of acid rain, the time for study alone has
passed,'' he said.
   ``As president, I will ask for a program to cut millions of tons
of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000, and to significantly
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.
   ``I will work out the exact amounts and the exact methodology
with Congress,'' he said.
   The Sierra Club's Early asked, however: ``Where was George Bush
when Bill Ruckelshaus (then head of the Environmental Protection
Agency) was trying to get a 4 million ton bill ... and was shot
down by the White House?''
   Bush also said he would make greater use of the EPA's emergency
authority to clean up toxic waste dumpsites, although he said the
Superfund established for the purpose has enough money.
   ``When America moves into the '90s, I want to ensure that `zero
tolerance' is applied not only to those who poison our children's
minds with drugs, but to those who poison our water with toxic
chemicals,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>U.S. MIA Group Accuses Thailand Of Blocking Reward Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. citizens claims
Thailand is trying to stop it from offering a $2.4 million reward
for the return of U.S. servicemen it believes remain held in
communist Indochinese countries.
   A Foreign Ministry official today said Thailand doesn't want the
group to distribute the reward offer because it would be seen as a
hostile act by Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and harm Thailand's
efforts to improve relations with these neighboring countries.
   The group said it was sponsoring seven Vietnam War veterans and
relatives of missing servicemen who plan to travel to Thailand in
October and float on the Mekong River Vietnamese currency notes
stamped with the reward offer. The money was pledged by former
North Carolina congressman Bill Hendon, former Vietnam War prisoner
Eugene McDaniel and 21 Republican congressmen.
   ``The government of Thailand is attempting to roadblock'' the
effort, said the group, the National Steering Committee for
American War Veterans, in a telex this week to The Associated Press
bureau in Bangkok.
   It said Ted Sampley, committee chairman and Vietnam War veteran,
met Aug. 26 with officials of the Thai Embassy in Washington and
was told: ``We have received word from Bangkok that you are not to
do this. If you violate our laws, you know what we must do.''
   The embassy officials refused to say what laws would be
violated, the telex said. ``We have no intention of violating any
Thai law, but if they are trying to short-circuit our plans because
of some political policy, they are going to have a problem,'' the
telex quoted Sampley as saying.
   He said: ``A very large part of the reason the U.S. became
involved in the Vietnam War was to protect Thailand, our most
valued friend and ally in Southeast Asia, from the threat of North
Vietnamese military adventurism. Over 58,000 Americans gave their
lives in that cause, and some of the Americans who fought that war
are still prisoners in Vietnam and Laos. I can't believe the Thai
government is trying prevent us from helping those men.''
   The Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he had not received any formal notice of the
group's plans.
   He said: ``It was an entirely American decision (to enter the
war). Thai soldiers also fought and died in a war that was
important for both countries. I don't accept Mr. Sampley's
reasoning.''
   Vietnam's official Communist Party newspaper on Aug. 3 denounced
the reward offer, and the Thai offficial noted that Laos strongly
objected when relatives of servicemen missing in action, or MIA,
floated similar offers on the Mekong last year. Both countries have
angrily denied holding American prisoners.
   ``We're not opposed to the (MIA) group,'' the official said.
``But ... Thailand cannot permit the group to stage what is
regarded as provocative activities on its soil.
   The new government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choohavan has put
priority on improving relations with Indochina. Relations have been
sour since the communist victories in all three countries in 1975
and especially since 1979, when Vietnam invaded and occupied
Cambodia.
   Hendon led a group of MIA relatives who traveled to northeastern
Thailand last September and tossed into the Mekong plastic-bound
leaflets containing the reward offer to anyone who brings out a
prisoner. Thai authorities aborted the group's original plans to
float helium-filled balloons containing the leaflets across the
river, which also runs through Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The U.S. State Department criticized the actions of Hendon's
group, saying it hampered cooperation with the Laotian government
in resolving the fates of some 550 servicemen missing in Laos.
Publicly, Washington says it has no evidence of Americans held
prisoner but cannot discount that possibility.
   The veterans committee said the group traveling to Thailand in
October included: Bruce Adams of Laramie, Wyo., the brother of an
MIA; Lynn Hampton of Winter Haven, Fla., a Vietnam veteran nurse;
Jeffrey Donahue of Brookfield Center, Conn., brother of an MIA;
Kathryn Fanning of Oklahoma City, wife of an MIA; William Sullivan,
a veteran from Jacksonville, N.C.; John M.G. Brown, a veteran from
Petrolia, Calif.; and Sampley of Kinston, North Carolina.
   Adams and Donahue were among the group that floated the reward
offers on the Mekong last year.

<HEAD>Non-Farm Businesses Lost Some Efficiency in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Non-farm businesses in the United States lost
some of their efficiency in the second quarter of the year but not
as much as previously believed, the Labor Department said today.
   In revised figures for April through June, the department said
productivity among non-farm businesses responsible for about
three-fourths of the nation's economic activity declined 1.4
percent, its first drop since 1986.
   Using preliminary figures, the government last month had put the
decline at 1.7 percent. The revision upward reflects a larger 5.2
percent increase in the output of goods and services than the 4.7
percent rise first reported.
   To achieve that increased output, businesses had to raise the
number of hours worked by their employees by 6.6 percent.
   Analysts said the increase in hours and conseqent decrease in
productivity reflects a hiring boom in which employers are having
to compete for less-skilled workers because of decade-low
unemployment.
   Hourly wages and benefits nominally rose at an annual rate of
4.2 percent in the second quarter. But after taking inflation into
account, the buying power of each hour of work declined 0.6
percent, the first drop in real compensation for workers in a year.
   The higher nominal wages and reduced productivity sent labor
costs skyrocketing at an annual rate of 5.7 percent, compared with
just a 0.1 percent increase the first quarter, the Labor Department
said.
   The April-June increase in labor costs was the largest quarterly
gain since the fourth quarter in 1986, when it jumped 6.1 percent.
However, labor costs are still only 2.9 percent above what they
were a year ago, lower than the rate of general consumer price
inflation.
   Among manufacturers responsible for one-fourth of the economic
activity, productivity improvements were slightly greater than
previously reported, 3.6 percent compared with 3.5 percent for the
quarter.
   The output of goods coming off factory assembly lines was
revised upward from 5.4 percent to 5.7 percent with only a 2
percent increase in the number of hours worked to achieve it.
   Manufacturers also have been more successful than businesses as
a whole in keeping a lid on wages and labor costs as workers laid
off in the 1981-82 recession were eager to return to their factory
jobs.
   Wages and benefits among manufacturing workers nominally rose at
an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter, reducing their
buying power in real terms by 1.7 percent.
   The higher productivity and relatively small increases in hourly
wages and benefits enabled manufacturers to actually reduce their
labor costs in the second quarter by 0.6 percent.
   Measured in dollars, U.S. factories have outperformed the rest
of the world in the past year in reducing labor costs, partly
through the smallest wage increases of any industrial country last
year.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Auditor Wants Thornburgh To Testify</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh
will not comply with an ``absurd'' summons issued in an
investigation of a contract awarded while he was governor, a
spokesman said.
   The summons was filed in state court last week by Auditor
General Don Bailey, who is seeking to question Thornburgh as part
of Bailey's investigation of a contract between Hubco Ford Truck
Sales of Allentown and the state.
   The $23 million contract for 428 trucks was awarded in 1984,
when Thornburgh was in his second term as Pennsylvania governor.
The U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him as attorney general last
month.
   Bailey contends that the state paid too much for the trucks and
that they were underpowered, and says he has evidence of forgery,
fraud and conspiracy in the deal by various officials under
Thornburgh. No charges have been filed.
   ``It would normally be (Thornburgh's) intent to cooperate with
any legitimate questions having to do with his administration,''
said David Runkel, a Thornburgh spokesman. ``But this is absurd.
It's a lot of nonsense and Mr. Bailey knows it.''
   Runkel said the summons is politically motivated. Bailey, who is
seeking re-election, is a Democrat; Thornburgh a Republican.
   Runkel said the matter has been fully investigated by the FBI,
the state attorney general and the U.S. attorney's office and no
problems have been found.
   The summons orders Thornburgh to testify before Bailey on the
Hubco contract and on other issues under investigation by his
office.
   Bailey vowed to take the matter to court if Thornburgh does not
comply. The auditor general had submitted his allegations to the
Senate Judiciary Committee during Thornburgh's confirmation
hearings last month.
   As auditor general, Bailey is authorized to gather information
on state matters under his jurisdiction, issue summonses to compel
testimony and forward evidence of wrongdoing to the state attorney
general.

<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO military flights over West
Germany were grounded today out of respect for victims of a fiery
air show disaster, and a victim who was badly burned in the crash
of the planes died.
   The latest fatality brought the death toll to 49, said state
government spokesman Juergen Dietzen. U.S. officials have said 52
people died.
   Three fighter jets of the Italian air force precision flying
team collided Sunday at the air show at the U.S. air base in
Ramstein. One plane hurtled into the crowd and exploded into flames.
   Wednesday night, thousands of mourners marched silently through
the streets of nearby Kaiserslautern behind a banner memorializing
victims.
   By this morning, 165 victims remained hospitalized and 53 people
were still missing, the Rhineland-Palatinate state government
spokesman said.
   Dietzen said 34 of the dead have been identified. They included
three Italian pilots of the stunt team and 31 spectators.
   He said most of those identified were West Germans but also
included a French and a Dutch citizen. He didn't know whether any
U.S. citizens were identified.
   Base spokeswoman Maj. Kathy White said two Americans were among
the dead.
   Earlier, regional officials said a 4-year-old boy was listed as
dead by mistake. They said he was seriously injured.
   Hesse state radio said several people had filed criminal
complaints with local prosecutors against Defense Minister Rupert
Scholz and the air show organizers alleging negligent manslaughter.
   The radio did not identify the people or say what connection
they had to the crash. Under West German law, any citizen can file
a criminal complaint against the government, and the government
must investigate.
   Local prosecutor Wilhelm Sattler already is investigating the
disaster.
   West Germany's skies, usually filled with jet fighters and
military helicopters, were quieter today, with only private and
commercial aircraft flying. Scholz said the NATO allies would keep
``all military aircraft'' on the ground today in a daylong memorial.
   About 2,000 people marched through Kaiserslautern, a city 70
miles southwest of Frankfurt, in a silent display of grief for
victims of the air show disaster.
   Some marchers carried red-and-black banners demanding an
immediate halt to all low-level training flights by NATO military
planes.
   In light of a series of crashes of military jets since March,
many West Germans have called for banning or curtailing low-level
training flights by planes of their own and a dozen Allied air
forces.
   One marcher carried a sign reading: ``Will Your Child Be The
Next To Be Maimed?''
   Before the march, former Green Party parliament member Roland
Vogt said, ``There is a better way to promote U.S. and German
relations than staging dangerous air shows every single year.''
   Wednesday's march was organized by the opposition Social
Democratic Party, the leftist Greens and church and community
groups.
   The disaster struck Sunday while a team of 10 Italian air force
stunt pilots performed maneuvers above a crowd of about 300,000
people.
   Some badly burned children still lay unclaimed in hospitals
Wednesday, leading officials to fear their parents had been killed
in the disaster.
   The Air Force at Ramstein released a statement identifying one
American who died as Pfc. Genevieve Riggs, 36, of the 110th
Military Police Company in Pirmasens, West Germany.
   A Ramstein spokesman, Rich Romera, said at least one other
American is known to have died but that the name could not be
released until relatives are notified.

   A 14-year veteran of the Prince George's
County police force was shot and killed, apparently by a fellow
officer, while executing a search warrant in a drug-related
investigation, Chief Michael J. Flaherty said today.
   Cpl. Mark Kevin Murphy, 35, died at Prince George's Hospital
Center in Cheverly about six hours after Wednesday night's raid of
an apartment complex in nearby Riverdale.
   ``It appears at this time that Corporal Murphy was accidentally
shot by a fellow officer,'' a tearful Flaherty told a news
conference. ``There was one wound, and it appears to be to the rear
of the head.''
   At least two officers were immediately behind Murphy, Flaherty
said.
   One weapon was recovered from the apartment, but it was not
fired during the raid, the chief said.
   Murphy, a member of the Emergency Services Team, was crouched,
attempting to place a hydraulic ram against the apartment door,
when the door suddenly opened, Flaherty said.
   At that point, officers said, they heard what sounded like a
gunshot, Flaherty said. Four shots were fired during the raid, he
added.
   Five men were arrested on drug charges. One suspect was taken to
Prince George's Hospital Center, where he was listed in stable
condition with head injuries.

<HEAD>North Dakota Senator Released From Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., was released
from the hospital today after intestinal surgery and said he was
eager to get back on the campaign trail.
   Burdick left Bethesda Naval Hospital after an operation Aug. 25
to remove part of his colon as a precaution against cancer.
   ``I'm feeling great,'' he said.
   Dr. Charles Blankenship, who performed the surgery, said the
senator was on the way to complete recovery, according to one of
Burdick's aides.
   Earlier, Blankenship had said an 18-inch section of Burdick's
colon was removed during a 2{-hour operation and that the procedure
was a complete success.
   He said no cancer was apparent in the excised colon tissue.
   The 80-year-old Burdick has served in the Senate since 1960 when
he won a special election. He is running for re-election this year
to a fifth full term and faces Republican Earl Strinden in November.
   Burdick said he would spend the Labor Day weekend with his wife
Jocelyn in Washington and then go back to work when the Senate
returns next week. He said he plans to spend the following weekend
in North Dakota.

<HEAD>New Walkouts Hamper Efforts to Clear Mail Backlog</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of postal workers walked off their jobs
for a second day today after the postal service hired temporary
workers to clear a massive backlog.
   The Union of Communication Workers had promised Wednesday's
walkout would last only 24 hours but said the hiring of temporary
workers could provoke indefinite strike actions.
   Royal Mail, which holds a near-monopoly in mail services, argued
that such hiring was done every Christmastime to clear backlogs and
it would continue to implement contingency measures to plow through
a backup of up to 100 million letters and parcels.
   ``The vast majority of postal staff are back but we have some
problems around the country,'' said postal spokesman Martin
Prestage. ``It's affecting a lot of customers today and tomorrow.
   ``As we do at Christmas if we have a backlog of over 50 million
letters we bring in other workers,'' he said. ``A lot of regular
staff are not sympathetic to this.''
   Areas affected by the new walkouts included parts of London,
Manchester and Liverpool, the union said.
   Prestage said the postal service also planned to use private
vehicles to tackle the pile-up, which could reach 100 million
pieces.
   Wednesday's 24-hour strike, the first nationwide walkout at
Royal Mail since 1971, paralyzed mail deliveries in many parts of
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
   About 140,000 union workers involved in sorting and delivery
were called out on strike, and the union claimed nearly total
participation. Royal Mail disputed the claims but provided no
figures.
   The dispute revolves around bonus payments for new recruits in
London and southeast England, where Royal Mail has trouble
attacting staff because of high living costs.
   The union said it wanted bonus payments given either to all
workers or none. It said it feared the practice might lead to the
end of national pay bargaining agreements.

<TEXT>
   State and federal agents made nine arrests in
a series of raids at homes and seafood businesses in three states
today, concluding a year-long investigation of illegal shellfish
harvesting.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the
raids were in Louisiana, Florida and South Carolina by officials of
its National Marine Fisheries Service, as well as the federal Food
and Drug Administration and state agencies.
   Names of those arrested were not released by the federal agency,
which said charges would include violations of both state and
federal laws pertaining to sale of shellfish.
   According to the report, millions of dollars worth of clams and
oysters were being illegally harvested from polluted waters and
sold in interstate commerce.
   ``For more than a year undercover agents entered a world of
black market oyster and clam dealers to document illegal
activities,'' said Suzanne Montero, a Fisheries Service special
agent.
   In South Carolina alone one dealer allegedly sold more than $1
million worth of illegally obtained shellfish over a 12-month
period, she said.
   Ten search warrants were served on oyster dealers in Louisiana
and Florida and nine warrants were served on South Carolina clam
dealers, officials said.
   Involved in the series of raids were 20 NOAA agents, 9 Food and
Drug Administration investigators and 58 officers from the Florida
Department of Natural Resources Marine Patiol, South Carolina
Wildlife and Marine Resources Division and Department of Health and
Environmental Control and the Louisiana State Police.

   Delta Flight 1141 from Jackson took off
with its usual passenger load today, with some fliers saying the
fatal crash one day earlier of the same flight in Texas improved
their odds.
   ``I think these kinds of accidents are only one of so many,''
said passenger Gregory Haygood. ``Hopefully it will make the pilots
and the maintenance people better check everything on the plane.''
   Later in the day, after the flight arrived at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, the plane taxied out for takeoff but was
forced to turn back, apparently because of an incorrect instrument
reading, a Delta spokesman said.
   Flight 1141 let off its passengers after returning to the
terminal at the airport.
   On Wednesday, Flight 1141, a 6:25 a.m. Salt Lake City-bound
flight that originates in Jackson, crashed and burned on takeoff at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. Thirteen passengers were killed and at
least 95 survived.
   Only six of the 34 passengers who boarded in Jackson had been
ticketed to travel on to Salt Lake City. None died.
   ``It's strange for them to leave with the front page stories
about the crash yesterday,'' Clotene Lathan of Pearl said as her
daughter and son-in-law boarded the plane today. ``But I've worked
here at the airport for 22 years and I'm not afraid of flying.''
   Lathan said that she'd recently retired after working 22 years
at the Jackson Municipal Airport as a flight insurance agent and
that the hundreds of policies she'd written without having to pay
benefits convinced her the couple were safe.
   Today's flight left 10 minutes late as boarding was delayed by
reporters interviewing travelers.
   Delta employees said they were told not to talk with reporters.
But one boarding agent who asked to remain anonymous said there
were 50 passengers on Flight 1141 today, which the employee said
was an average number.
   None of the passengers interviewed said they were afraid to fly.
   ``I think the odds probably increased in my favor,'' University
of Mississippi professor Chester Quarles said. Quarles and his
wife, Bobbe, were headed to visit relatives in California.
   A middle-aged man in a business suit said the greatest hazard he
faced today was getting through the half-dozen reporters and onto
the plane.
   ``This is bloody nonsense, just bloody nonsense,'' he said,
motioning at a TV cameraman and news reporters. ``This is morbid
nonsense.''

<TEXT>
   Economic changes and political reforms that
led to more democratic elections are only starting points in a
process that will help Mexico face the future, President Miguel de
la Madrid said today in his final report to the nation.
   In a speech prepared for delivery to Congress today, de la
Madrid noted that on Dec. 1, 1982 he had inherited a nation near
bankruptcy and faced a crisis that ``shook the very foundations of
our social structure.''
   The composition of the new, sharply divided Congress is itself
evidence ``of the significant transformations that the country has
undergone,'' de la Madrid said.
   He said he had renegotiated a foreign debt that now stands at
$104 billion, resisted pressure for a moratorium on payments,
reduced the role of the state in the economy and opened Mexico to
foreign competition.
   He also instituted a painful austerity program that cut
Mexicans' buying power by about 50 percent.
   ``We recognize that the cost of these changes has been high for
the majority of our population,'' de la Madrid said. But Mexicans
``wisely understood that to attain lasting well-being it was
necessary to truly reform the country.''
   He said that further debt renegotiation is necessary ``on the
principle of joint responsibiility between debtors and on adjusting
debt servicing to countries' real capacity to pay,'' but gave no
details on how that might occur.
   De la Madrid called the July 6 vote, in which the long-ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, suffered reverses, ``an
electoral process of historic significance.''
   He made no direct reference to charges of massive fraud that
tainted the vote, saying ``the process was orderly, peaceful and
closely monitored.''
   The combined opposition won nearly 50 percent of the vote and
leftist candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who gained 31 percent of the
official tally, claims he beat Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI
candidate due to succeed de la Madrid on Dec. 1.
   In the Chamber of Deputies, the PRI ended up with 260 seats and
a divided opposition with 240 seats _ 139 for the leftist Front and
101 for the rightist National Action Party. The left also won four
of 64 seats in the Senate _ the first time the PRI has ever lost
Senate seats.
   Protests have continued since the election, with 10,000 people
rallying in favor of Cardenas in downtown Mexico City Wednesday.
   De la Madrid called on all citizens to ``continue perfecting our
democracy '' in accordance with the law.
   ``The journey along the road to democracy is a never-ending one;
the recent elections should be seen as a further stride toward its
higher reaches,'' said de la Madrid.
   On relations with the United States, de la Madrid noted that he
met with President Reagan six times and said ``moments of
difficulty and lack of understanding are being gradually overcome.''
   He hailed the participation of the Mexican army, navy and air
forces in the fight against drug trafficking, but said the problem
could not be solved ``unless the demand for drugs is combated in
major centers of consumption.''
   De la Madrid, who has lowered Mexico's high-profile role in
Central America, said little about the conflicts there except to
note Mexico's role in efforts to achieve a regional peace.
   He said that the attempt to decentralize Mexico's economy would
help reduce pressure on Mexico City, which is one of the world's
largest and most polluted cities. Industry is being directed to
small and medium-sized cities, he said.
   He said Mexico had been badly hurt by low petroleum prices, but
other sectors such as auto manufacturing had helped compensate in
the export market. Unemployment and strikes were both down, he said.

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis accused Vice President
George Bush today of ``playing hooky'' on education while the
Reagan administration has slashed teacher training and remedial
courses for poor children.
   Opening a pre-Labor Day foray into three crucial West Coast
states, the Democratic nominee boasted of a school aid program he
initiated as Massachusetts governor, and asked about his Republican
opponent:
   ``Where was George while all this was going on? Where was the
man who now says he wants to be the `education president?' He was
playing hooky. He was nowhere to be found.''
   Dukakis said in the prepared text of an Oakland speech that the
Nov. 8 presidential election offers a choice between those with a
lifetime commitment to education and ``those who see it as an
election-year strategy.''
   On his arrival in California Wednesday night, Dukakis also took
a swing at Bush's newly proclaimed interest in protecting the
environment, including steps to eliminate acid rain.
   Dukakis called Bush ``one of the charter members of the
environmental wrecking crew which went to Washington in 1981'' with
President Reagan. He said Bush had flip-flopped on offshore oil
drilling, a hot political issue in California.
   Dukakis made his remarks as the Bush campaign devoted a day of
campaigning Wednesday to environmental issues. Dukakis is touring
three West Coast states _ California, Oregon and Washington _ in an
effort to attract the conservative Democrats who voted for
President Reagan in the last two elections.
   While campaigning last June in California, Bush said he opposed
offshore drilling for oil, according to Dukakis. ``Last week in
Texas he said he was for it,'' Dukakis said.
   An aide to the Massachusetts governor later showed reporters a
Los Angeles Times story that quoted Bush as telling a Texas
audience, ``My opponent opposes offshore drilling and I support
it.''
   Dukakis said, ``We need a president who understands how
important our environment is, how important out quality of life is,
a president whose environmental policy doesn't change with the time
zones.
   ``I understand Mr. Bush was in Michigan talking about the
environment,'' Dukakis said. ``Coming from somebody who was charter
member of the environmental wrecking crew which went to Washington
in 1981, that's very strange indeed.''
   Earlier in the day, Maine Sen. George Mitchell delivered a
political pre-emptive strike designed to blunt Bush criticism of
Dukakis' record on the clean-up of Boston Harbor.
   Bush was in Boston today to tour the polluted harbor.
   The three states Dukakis is visiting have not supported a
Democrat in the last four presidential elections.
   Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey carried Washington in 1968. The last
time California and Oregon backed a Democrat for president was in
1964.
   Those three states have large numbers of Democrats who have
consistently backed Republican presidential candidates, a pattern
Dukakis hopes to break this fall.
   Referred to now as Reagan Democrats, those voters are a major
target of the Dukakis campaign.
   Top Dukakis campaign strategists are convinced Bush cannot hold
the support once reliably Democratic blue collar voters gave to
Reagan.
   ``We are not re-running the elections of 1980 or 1984,'' said
Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich. ``We are not running
against Ronald Reagan. We are running against George Bush and our
focus is very much on the future.''
   Before he left Boston, Dukakis had a joint news conference with
Mitchell, who said: ``In 1981, the Reagan-Bush administration tried
to kill the entire water pollution program. Congress resisted and
so they then settled for undermining it.''
   Republicans have blamed Dukakis for dragging his feet on efforts
to clean up the harbor.
   ``It's been polluted for hundreds of years,'' said Dukakis.
``I'm very proud of the fact that I'm the governor who's cleaning
it up.''
   Mitchell also gave his support to Dukakis' renewed questioning
of Bush's role in the sale of arms to Iran.
   A member of the Senate-House committee that investigated the
arms sale, Mitchell quoted Bush in a television interview as saying
he went along with the arms sale because ``if he erred, he erred on
the side of getting the hostages out.''
   The Maine senator said that ``in his (Bush's) own words it is
unmistakably clear that he went along with the sale of arms and
knew that it was an exchange for hostages.''
   Increasingly under attack by Bush and Reagan, Dukakis responded
this week by renewing his criticism of the arms sales.

<HEAD>Man With AIDS Sues State to Allow Freezing of His Body Upon Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDS patient and a cryonics laboratory
have sued the state for the right to have his body frozen after
death in the hope he can someday be revived.
   The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court on Tuesday by an
unidentified man and by Alcor Life Extension Foundation Inc. of
Riverside, which offers cryonic suspension.
   Cryonic suspension is the practice of freezing bodies after
death in the belief that eventually they may be able to be brought
back to life and cured of their illness.
   The lawsuit challenges the Health Services Department's refusal
to grant a permit so the AIDS victim can have his body frozen. The
state granted such permission until it changed its policy in June,
the suit stated.
   The suit claims the man has a constitutional right to control
the disposition of his body.
   Pete Weisser, a Health Services spokesman in Sacramento, said
Wednesday that the department had not been served with the lawsuit
and had no comment on it.
   Weisser said that there is no provision in state law for
issuance of a permit for of cryonic suspension. But Saul Kent, a
member of Alcor Life Extension Foundation, contends the law does
not forbid the issuing of such a permit.
   ``The only reason they have yet given for declaring it illegal
or saying it may be illegal is there is nothing in the law saying
you can do it,'' Kent said.
   Riverside County authorities have been investigating Alcor since
Kent's 83-year-old mother, Dora, died there Dec. 11 without a
doctor present and her head was removed and frozen.
   The coroner's office ruled Mrs. Kent's death a homicide brought
on by a lethal dose of barbiturates. Authorities have not filed any
charges, however, and Alcor won a court order barring examination
of Mrs. Kent's head.

<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi told military cadets
he will organize civilian militias to maintain order and will
dismantle the regular army and police.
   The Libyan leader gave no timetable for eliminating what he
called the ``classical army and the traditional police.'' His
meaning also was unclear because he also said military service
still would be mandatory.
   Gadhafi spoke Wednesday at a graduation ceremony for the cadets
at Tripoli stadium. He has made several calls in the past for
ending the military, but this was the first time he publicly gave
details.
   Gadhafi also said 1 million Libyans have used their salaries to
pay for weapons. He said the arms would be kept in barracks and
used by the civilians in case of security threats.
   His remarks indicated, however, that military officers would
retain some authority over the civilian militias.
   He also announced that mandatory military service will reduced
from two years to one and said no one would be exempt.
   The moves would be the ``crowning of the completion of the state
of the masses, and power of the people, the power of the people's
congresses and committees everywhere,'' he said. The people's
congresses are Libya's governing bodies and the committees are
revolutionary panels that serve as watchdogs of Gadhafi's
revolution.
   In the audience was Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat, who came to Tripoli to for today's celebration of
the Sept. 1, 1969, coup that overthrew the monarchy and carried
Gadhafi to power.
   Pointing at Arafat and shouting, Gadhafi chided the PLO leader
for his good relations with Egypt, with which the Libyan leader has
a long enmity.
   ``I challenge Arafat to (prove) if there is any benefit to
having a relationship with Egypt,'' he said. ``If there is any
advantage, it would be for America.'' When Arafat heard his name
mentioned he straightened up, turned to a colleague and smiled
broadly.

   A land mine exploded on a highway beneath
a police jeep Thursday, killing two constables and injuring three
others, police said.
   The explosion 12 miles north of Amritsar was believed to the be
work of Sikh militants, said Police Superintendent G.S. Mann.
   The jeep was on a routine patrol when the mine exploded, he said.
   It was the first reported incident of Sikh radicals using land
mines in their campaign for an independent homeland in the northern
state of Punjab.
   The militants have killed 1,825 people in the state this year.
Most have been shot and killed, but the radicals also have used
bombs and rockets.
   The militants consider moderate Sikhs opposed to their campaign
to be traitors. Sikh radicals launched a war for a separate state
in 1982, claiming discrimination by Hindus, who form 80 percent of
India's 800 million people.
   Sikhs make up only 2 percent of the population, but the
community is in a majority in Punjab.

   A 7,900-member citizen's security force has been
formed to combat lawlessness in Shenzhen, one of China's most
Westernized and wide-open cities.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 1,200 uniformed citizen
guards paraded through the southern China city on Wednesday.
   The force was formed in 1984 for street guard work, and has
branched out to become crimestoppers in offices, factories and
farms.
   Some carry nightsticks and firearms, and some are equipped with
mobile radios and motorcycles.
   Since last year, the force has captured 13,864 criminals and
helped police solve 412 cases and recover stolen property worth
$600,000, Xinhua said.
   They also mediate disputes, aid in rescues and promote public
order, it said.
   Shenzhen, a special economic zone formed in 1980 to attract
foreign investors, is one of China's most free-wheeling cities
because of its contacts with foreign countries and its proximity to
Hong Kong. Recent articles in the official media have reported
serious problems there with prostitution, promiscuity, child labor
and labor unrest.

   The government on Thursday earmarked $35
million to aid stores, companies and workers hit by a blaze that
destroyed much of the historic Chiado shopping district a week ago.
   The Cabinet of the center-right Social Democrat government said
it would set aside $32.5 million in subsidized loans for
shopkeepers and businesses affected by the fire.
   Deputy Prime Minister Eurico de Melo said another $2.5 million
in grants would be available to cover 80 percent of the wages to
workers who lost their jobs.
   The loans to businesses would be available for up to three years
at half the normal interest rate charged by banks, he said.
   Insurers have put the damage at $300 million, but the president
of the Lisbon Shopkeepers Association, Jose Ferreira de Matos,
estimated losses at $600 million.
   The government said between 1,200 and 1,300 workers were left
unemployed by the fire, although trade unions earlier estimated
2,000 had lost their jobs.
   One person was killed and 43 were injured in the Aug. 25 fire
that swept through a 10-block area of the 200-year-old Chiado
downtown district.

   Police launched a crackdown Thursday
on black-market sales of tickets for the opening and closing
ceremonies of the Olympics.
   Ticket brokers have sold $200 seats for the Sept. 17 opening
ceremonies at up to $5,400, police said. Many of the buyers were
Koreans.
   Police believe more than 20 groups have been engaged in such
transactions. They said investigators are questioning one broker to
determine how he purchased large blocks of tickets.
   Nearly 1 million people applied for the 20,000 opening ceremony
tickets put on sale locally, and a lottery decided who could by
them.
   Organizers said more than half of the sporting event tickets put
on sale in South Korea have been sold, with many for preliminary
competition and demonstration sports still unsold.
   About 4 million of the total 4.5 million tickets are being sold
in South Korea, with prices ranging from $3 to $55.

   Pilot error apparently was to blame for
the fatal crash of the Redigo prototype training jet at an air show
in Belgium, the head of the investigating team said Thursday.
   The state-owned Valmet corporation said it is determined to
display the aircraft at this week's air show in Farnborough,
England.
   ``I have found no evidence to support banning the Redigo,'' said
Seppo Hamalainen, who investigated Sunday's accident at Kleine
Brogel. ``It is likely that the crash was caused by human error,''
he said in a radio interview.
   Pilot Ari Piippo, 44, died when the four-seater plane failed to
come out of a spin.
   The Finnish Board of Aviation is to decide Friday whether to ban
Redigo's performance at Farnborough.
   Hannu Halonen, Redigo's other test pilot who watched Piippo's
fatal accident, said he's ready to fly the six-minute program in
the Redigo II at Farnborough, one of the world's leading air shows.
   Finnish defense officials have said an order for 10 aircraft
won't be canceled, but warned Valmet the purchase was ``on
condition that the Redigo meets the requirements of the air force.''
   Valmet had high hopes of receiving substantial orders for the
plane at Farnborough.
   The managing director of Valmet's aircraft section, Heikki
Mantyla, told The Associated Press on Thursday he believes the
accident won't affect sales.
   ``We are committed to the Redigo program and will continue to
manufacture this aircraft,'' said Mantyla. ``Everyone in the
business knows that prototypes are very prone to accidents and I
firmly believe that Sunday's unfortunate accident will only
slightly slow down its sale prospects.''

<TEXT>
   A former political prisoner has been
arrested again, six months after he was freed by presidential
pardon, his relatives and police said Thursday.
   Raila Odinga, son of former Vice President Oginga Odinga, was
arrested Tuesday on a Nairobi street by plainclothes police, and he
has not been heard from since then, the elder Odinga said.
   ``I do not want to say anything more than that,'' he added.
   Police Commissioner Phillip Kilonzo confirmed Raila Odinga had
been arrested, adding: ``I cannot disclose anything at this stage.''
   Odinga, 42, was Kenya's longest-serving political prisoner
before he and eight other detainees were released Feb. 5 by
President Daniel arap Moi. Odinga had been jailed since a failed
1982 coup attempt against Moi.
   In August, Parliament amended the constitution to allow police
to detain people suspected of a capital crime for up to 14 days
without charging them or bringing them to court. Previously, police
were required to charge them within 24 hours of arrest.
   Oginga Odinga was Kenya's first vice president after the country
gained independence from Britain in 1963. He served under the late
President Jomo Kenyatta for three years before political
differences caused a split that led to the elder Odinga's
resignation.
   Moi, the last of three Kenyatta vice presidents, became leader
when Kenyatta died in 1978.
   The elder Odinga had been one of the few open critics of Moi,
but quieted his attacks since his son's release from detention.

   Kerry Dee Ketchem, 36, of Odon, already is serving five years in

   Beginning in 1986, Ketchem led authorities on a whirlwind fraud

He collected $100,000 on a life insurance policy by falsely
claiming his wife died.
   Appearing on ``Super Password'' under the name Patrick Quinn, he
was recognized by employees at an Anchorage, Alaska, bank as a
fugitive in a credit-card fraud case. He was arrested when he
attempted to pick up his game show winnings.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Maung Maung today rejected
protesters' demands for an interim government but said he will
allow the formation of student unions, which have been illegal in
Burma.
   Earlier today, striking employees closed Rangoon's airport
despite a government warning. Striking public employees said 1
million people would turn out for an anti-government rally at a
park, but only about 100,000 showed up.
   In a speech broadcast over state-run Rangon radio, Maung Maung
said any changes in Burma's one-party government must follow
constitutional procedures.
   He said the government already plans a Sept. 12 meeting to
consider holding a referendum on one-party rule, a process that
could lead to amendment of the constitution and general elections.
   He added that Article 11 of the Constitution, under which only
the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party is legal, must be changed.
   In what was seen as a gesture to students who have been at the
vanguard of pro-democracy protests, Maung Maung said the government
would permit student unions as long as they were ``properly
formed.''
   He also said that after passions cooled, the government would
rebuild the Rangoon University student union building, which the
military destroyed in July 1962 after Ne Win led the coup that
ended democracy in Burma.
   Ne Win, who resigned in July after 26 years of authoritarian
rule, abolished all political parties except his own, outlawed all
unions and opposition groups and imposed rigid controls on the
media.
   Since Maung Maung came to power Aug. 19, replacing hardliner
Sein Lwin, masses of demonstrators have rallied and held strikes
demanding immediate formation of an interim government to restore
democracy.
   On Aug. 24, Maung Maung promised the party would hold an
emergency meeting to consider a referendum on the issue. But the
call did not end protests.
   On Sunday, students announced they had formed an illegal student
union.
   The airport strike halted all international flights and further
isolated the Southeast Asian nation. Union Burma Airways last
Friday suspended both domestic and international service, but
flights by other carriers had continued from Bangladesh, Nepal and
Thailand.
   The All Services General Strike Committee, an illegal government
association that was formed Tuesday, had called for 1 million
workers from government departments and state-owned corporations to
rally at Bandoola Gardens, the capital's largest park.
   People marched along Rangoon's main streets this morning and by
noon, several thousand striking state employees and students had
gathered outside the park. But the crowd appeared poorly organized
and no attempt was made to enter the park.
   An hour later, all but a few hundred demonstators had peacefully
dispersed. Two small rallies, one outside the nearby U.S. Embassy
and one at a nearby government building, also broke up.
   On Wednesday, the government of President Maung Maung warned it
would take action against demonstrators illegally occupying
government buildings and facilities.
   Crowds in cities throughout Burma have taken over and sometimes
destroyed offices of the government and of the ruling Burma
Socialist Program Party.
   Government troops, who have not intervened in protests since
five days of bloody riots forced Sein Lwin to resign Aug. 12, took
over local government offices in the Bahan and Sanchaung areas of
the capital Wednesday night and began repairing them.
   Members of former leader Ne Win's entourage, meanwhile, went to
the Foreign Trade Bank on Wednesday and tried to transfer the
equivalent of $3 million to a bank in London, a senior bank
official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said junior
bank employees heard about the request and demanded the bank not
comply. They said Ne Win no long had authority to order such
transfers.
   As word spread of the transfer request, a crowd gathered arond
the bank and senior bank officials eventually rejected it, the
official said. He declined to identify the people who sought the
transfer or the bank in London.
   In another development, at least five illegal newspapers have
appeared on the streets of Rangoon, selling briskly at 83 cents a
copy, about 10 times the cost of the six government-approved
newspapers. They have been reporting news of anti-government
activities.

<HEAD>Trip With Meese By Justice Aides Questioned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the Justice Department officials who
went to Japan to attend a legal conference with Edwin Meese III
this week might have been barred from the trip under Attorney
General Richard L. Thornburgh's travel policy, an aide says.
   Thornburgh, sworn in to succeed Meese on Aug. 12, will pursue
the policy he had as governor of Pennsylvania, allowing trips only
when they relate directly to official duties, the aide said
Wednesday, speaking on condition he not be named.
   ``Based on his experiences in Pennsylvania, he will only permit
travel when it pertains exactly to your job,'' the aide said. He
said this policy would rule out traveling on ``people-to-people
type'' cultural exchanges.
   ``The decision in Pennsylvania was not to go on these kinds of
trips,'' he said.
   Thornburgh and his assistants discussed the five participants on
the Tokyo trip, but decided against bumping any of them because the
trip had been planned long before the attorney general assumed
control of the agency, the aide said.
   Moreover, they felt that pulling back from the four-day legal
symposium that ended today could embarrass the Japanese hosts, he
said. ``It involved a foreign government and certain commitments
had been made.''
   The seminar, entitled ``U.S.-Japan Bilateral Session: A New Era
in Legal and Economic Relations,'' ran from Aug. 29-Sept. 1,
although some of the participants went over days earlier.
   Joseph A. Morris, director of the office of liaison services and
head of the Justice delegation, submitted requests for travel per
diem for 10 days in Japan at a cost of $237 daily.
   Morris, a Reagan administration appointee as were the other
participants, has announced his resignation to join the Mid-America
Legal Foundation in Chicago on Sept. 18.
   Others on the trip were Richard Abell, assistant attorney
general at the office of justice programs; Patrick Korten, director
of the office of public affairs; Robert Bonner, U.S. attorney in
Los Angeles, and Cheryl Nolan, Morris' subordinate.
   Deborah Bustion-Wade, a Justice Department spokeswoman,
initially said that Charles Rule, assistant attorney general for
antitrust, went on the trip. Later, she said that although Rule
went to Japan, he did not attend the legal conference but was on
other business.
   But his travel as a seminar participant was approved by Harold
Christensen, the acting deputy attorney general, in a memorandum
dated Aug. 19.
   The program included seminars such as ``Creating a Crime-Free
Society,'' and ``Japan-U.S. Relations: Sharing a Common Goal.''
There were also addresses by Japanese and Americans and field trips
to prisons, Japanese companies and government offices.
   The Justice Department paid the expenses of the six U.S.
officials, but did not pick up the tab for Meese or his wife,
Ursula.
   Norman Swanson, a spokesman for People-to-People International,
the Kansas City-based sponsor of the conference, told The New York
Times the group would cover the Meeses' travel expenses.
   But William Barraclough, the head of People-to-People, a
non-profit group, said he did not know if his group had paid the
Meeses' way.
   U.S. officials from other agencies also attended the trip.
   They included Susan Liebeler and Ronald Cass, members of the
International Trade Commission, and Jim Craig, the ITC spokesman.
The ITC paid their expenses.
   But Edward Fleischman, a commissioner at the Securities and
Exchange Commission, accepted a free trip from the sponsors, SEC
attorney Paul Gonson said. The SEC, like some agencies, has the
authority to allow some people to accept gifts so long as the
purpose is to represent the commission.
   Last year, a similar conference attended by Meese and other
Justice officials was held in China. Sponsors of the trip picked up
expenses for Mrs. Meese and Deborah Morris, Morris' wife. The
Office of Government Ethics said recently that the women should not
have taken the free trips. Federal regulations prohibit relatives
of government employees from accepting gifts.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
today named Sweden's U.N. ambassador as his special representative
to the faltering Iran-Iraq peace talks to continue negotiations in
his absence.
   Perez de Cuellar announced his selection of Jan Eliasson, 47,
shortly before departing for Lisbon with the 8-day-old talks
deadlocked.
   The Iraqi and Iranian foreign ministers have not met
face-to-face since last Friday because of problems over formalizing
the cease-fire and agreeing on early troop withdrawal and freedom
of navigation. Negotiations have continued on a lower, technical
level.
   In the hour before his departure the U.N. chief held separate
meetings with the two ministers, Tariq Aziz of Iraq and Ali Akbar
Velayati of Iran, to introduce them to Eliasson.
   Velayati later told reporters he was very pleased with the
appointment of Eliasson and was ``glad the secretary-general will
continue his supervision and guidance of the talks.''
   Perez de Cuellar said he was prepared to return to Geneva on
Friday if necessary to continue negotiations in person.
   ``These are very difficult, complicated negotiations and it
takes time,'' the secretary-general said as he continued
last-minute efforts to arrange a joint meeting of the two
ministers. ``The problem is lack of confidece, distrust ... like
sand, you cannot build on sand.''
   But he said, ``I am persuaded that both parties honestly are
interested in finding a solution.''
   He said both ministers would remain in Geneva as long as
necessary.
   Eliasson worked for six years as special assistant to the late
Swedish Prime Minister, Olaf Palme, on the Iran-Iraq problem.
Former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim appointed Palme as his
special representative on the Persian Gulf war.
   Eliasson was appointed by Palme shortly before the outbreak of
the war in September 1980.
   On Wednesday night, the secretary-general failed to persuade
Iranian and Iraqi envoys to meet face-to-face.
   The main issue stalling the talks centers on a 1975 treaty
making the Shatt-al-Arab waterway the southern border of the
warring nations.
   Iraq has repudiated the treaty and wants full control of the
waterway, its only outlet to the sea. It also demands that the
channel immediately be cleared of sunken ships, which have blocked
it since the beginning of the war.
   Iran maintains the 1975 treaty is valid. It refuses to clear the
waterway until a permanent cease-fire and troop withdrawals are
worked out.
   A preliminary truce took effect Aug. 20.
   Iranian leaders claimed Wednesday that Iraq had violated the
U.N.-brokered cease-fire on three occasions.
   President Ali Khamenei was quoted by Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency as calling for ``the massive presence of
people on the battefield'' to ``enable us to stand against any new
aggression by the enemy.'' Khameini made the statement in a speech
in the northeastern city of Mashad.
   IRNA is monitored in Cyprus.
   In Baghdad, the state-run al-Jomhuriya newspaper demanded that
Iran ``abandon once and for all its greedy intentions in Iraq and
other Arab countries and not interfere in Iraq's internal affairs.''
   International pressure appeared to be building to persuade the
countries to reach an agreement.
   Perez de Cuellar met separately Tuesday with the ambassadors of
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ Britain,
China, France, the Soviet Union and the United States. Observers
believe he urged the five to exert pressure on Iran and Iraq to
achieve progress in the stalled talks.
   In Baghdad, the ambassadors of the five countries met President
Saddam Hussein on Wednesday. The official Iraqi News Agency said
Hussein reiterated Iraq's desire to reach a settlement with Iran.
It did not elaborate.
   The Geneva talks were preceded by Iran's acceptance in July of a
U.S. cease-fire resolution. Iraq accepted the resolution when it
was passed last year. The two sides agreed to a cease-fire followed
by the direct talks.

   The National Bureau of Standards, the agency

pound, is no more.
   That doesn't mean the United States will no longer have any
official standards, though. It's just that the name of the Commerce
Department agency
   has been changed to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
   The name change was instituted when President Reagan signed the
new Technology Competitiveness Act, which gives some new
responsibilities to the agency.
   In addition to setting standards for length, weight, measure,
time and sundry other things, the institute has been directed to
work with American industry to help improve product quality,
modernize manufacturing processes and generally better compete with
foreign companies.
   It will set up a series of regional centers to help spread
improvements in manufacturing technology, help make federal
techology more available, encourage commercialization of new
products and help state and local officials in setting technology
policy.

<TEXT>
   With Labor Day nearing, Oregon officials barred the public from
6.6 million acres of woodland and Montana's governor urged
residents to ``find asphalt'' to limit the number of new wildfires
as flames threatened homes in two states.
   In Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park's south gate opened this
morning for the first time in almost two weeks. All five gates and
public roads within the park are now open despite fires that have
charred more than a half-million acres.
   Fire also blackened forest and brush Wednesday in Washington,
California, Idaho and Utah.
   About 180,000 more acres burned during the past week as new
blazes ignited in eastern Oregon and Washington, Northern
California and northern Idaho, a federal drought advisory issued
this week said.
   It said the northern Rockies and northern Plains remained very
dry, contributing to the worsening forest fires, and little relief
was expected soon.
   Oregon's Department of Forestry announced Wednesday that 3.8
million acres of private, state and other forest in eastern Oregon
will be closed indefinitely due to extreme fire danger and scarce
resources to fight new blazes. Already closed are 2.8 million acres
in western Oregon.
   ``The state needs to limit the risk of wildfire and this has
proven to be an effective way to do that,'' said State Forester
James Brown.
   Dry grass, timber and rugged terrain also made it too dangerous
to directly attack Oregon's biggest forest fire, the 36,000-acre
Tepee Butte blaze, so it will be allowed to burn to fire lines.
   The blaze in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and Hell's
Canyon National Recreation Area on the Idaho line will grow to
59,000 acres before it reaches the lines, U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Ron DeHart said.
   ``We cannot safely put crews up close to this fire,'' he said.
   The Forest Service on Wednesday also began training the first of
350 backup firefighters from Oregon to relieve weary crews around
the nation.
   Montana Gov. Ted Schwinden appealed to the public Wednesday to
avoid outdoor recreation during Labor Day weekend and said
restrictions may be imposed if the fire hazard doesn't ease.
   His advice to Labor Day recreationists: ``Find some asphalt.''
   The governor said 5,000 firefighters were battling blazes on
208,000 acres in Montana, and 173,000 acres burned in earlier
fires. He put the cost at $15 million.
   ``We simply don't need any more fires at this point,'' Schwinden
said.
   The Montana Fish and Game Commission reluctantly bowed Wednesday
to a request from Schwinden and postponed the start of all hunting
seasons until Sept. 16 because of fire danger. Sheep and mountain
goat seasons were to open today, and several other seasons were to
open Saturday.
   Some woodland in Washington, where fires have burned more than
23,000 acres, also was put off-limits Wednesday due to fire danger.
A forest products company closed 400,000 acres to the public and
the U.S. Forest Service banned campfires outside designated
campgrounds in the Wenatchee National Forest.
   Along western Montana's Rocky Mountain Front, bulldozers cut a
fire line Wednesday to protect two ranches from a 51,000-acre blaze
that spread Monday from the Scapegoat Wilderness to private land.
Crews also hosed down a cabin as a precaution.
   ``We've had lots of calls from people all over the area offering
(bulldozers) and whatever they got,'' said John Krause, whose ranch
is a mile and a half from the fire.
   At West Yellowstone, Mont., on the western border of Yellowstone
National Park, officials assured nervous residents that flames from
the 109,000-acre North Fork blaze two miles away in the park would
not reach town.
   About 1,000 firefighters dug 12-foot-wide lines with bulldozers
and removed vegetation from the edge of the community. An
evacuation plan is ready as a precaution.
   In the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north of Yellowstone, two
fires consumed more than 83,000 acres by Wednesday and firefighters
fought to keep flames from advancing farther south.
   In nearby Livingston, Mont., some residents covered their faces
Wednesday with bandanas, surgeon's masks or gas masks.
   ``The smoke's been really bad,'' said Dain Kovash, a motel
clerk. ``It makes smoking cigarettes seem healthy.''
   Yellowstone's chief naturalist said Wednesday that nothing but
winter weather will snub wildfires that have blackened more than 20
percent of the park's 2.2 million acres.
   ``We are still anticipating that these fires will keep burning
until the first heavy winter snows,'' said naturalist George
Robinson.
   In eastern Idaho, crews and bulldozers protected ranches in
Caribou National Forest from the raging, 6,800-acre Trail Creek
fire a mile away.
   ``The majority of the ranches are on alert,'' said forest
spokesman Dan Pugmire. ``But we didn't have to alert them. They
were all standing outside watching it.''
   The fire was the most threatening of 17 major blazes in Idaho
that have burned more than 70,000 acres.
   In California, crews fought two fast-moving fires in the central
Sierra Nevada. One, sparked by children playing with matches,
destroyed at least one home, forced the evacuation of 17 people
near Mariposa and burned 250 acres. The second consumed 1,800 acres
west of Kings Canyon National Park.
   Anticipating you'd want a 100-word bit on Utah fires for the rdp:
   Fanned by overnight winds, a once-controlled blaze near northern
Utah's Pineview Reservoir jumped fire lines and more than doubled
to 1,200 acres.

   Two amorous bulls have landed their

neighboring herd.
   Judge James P. Fiedler scheduled trial for Nov. 28 to determine
how much damages should be assessed in the 1986 incident.
   Dairy farmers Michael and Paul Mieden of rural Barneveld are
seeking about $74,000, including $33,000 for reduced milk
production, from Lloyd Vivian and his insurance company. Vivian's
attorney has offered to settle for $2,500.
   The Miedens argue that Vivian failed to patch a hole in a fence,
and the bulls got into a pasture containing about 80 of their cows.
   About 30 cattle became pregnant, including some heifers that
``will never reach full potential in size and production'' because
they were so young when they became pregnant, Colleen Martin, an
appraiser hired by the Miedens, said Wednesday.
   A veterinarian hired by Vivian said that the Miedens could have
gotten abortions for the pregnant cattle for only $500.
   Fiedler said there have been similar cases, but usually
involving only a few cows.
   In a case that reached the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1911, a
farmer objected to the social status of a ``lowly born'' bull that
trespassed in his field and courted one of his heifers, named
Martha.
   ``This plebian, having aspirations beyond his humble station in
life, wandered beyond the confines of his own pastures and sought
the society of the adolescent and unsophisticated Martha,'' Justice
John Barnes wrote.
   The resultant calf's ``sinister birth'' left it unqualified for
prizes at the county fair, the justice wrote. The court upheld a
$75 verdict against the bull's owner.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Rebounded in July</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Construction spending in July posted its
sharpest increase in four months, only partly recovering from a
slump in June, the government said Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said building activity rose 1.2 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $401.0 billion in July,
following a revised 1.5 percent drop in the previous month. The
June figure was originally estimated as a slight 0.1 percent gain.
   Construction activity this year has been generally lackluster,
seesawing from month to month. The July performance was the
strongest since March, while the June decline was the worst in five
months.
   ``I think it shows the futility of the Federal Reserve Board
raising (interest) rates in expectation of a great (economic) boom.
In construction, there isn't going to be a great boom. I think it's
just sort of plugging along,'' said Michael Sumichrast, an
economist in Washington who publishes a construction newsletter.
   For the first seven months of the year, construction activity
was up only 0.9 percent over the same period in 1987. That doesn't
even keep pace with the 1.9 percent increase in building costs
between the two periods.
   The strength in July came from increases in government building
projects, offices and apartments. Single-family housing, factories
and shopping centers registered declines.
   Construction of office buildings in July was up 2.9 percent to
$28.8 billion. Activity in that sector has risen or held steady in
every month since February despite high vacancy rates in many parts
of the country, particularly the Southwest where the energy
industry has slumped.
   ``It's incredible. I don't know why they're still building,
because the amount of empty (office) buildings is staggering,''
Sumichrast said.
   The July level of office construction was up 9.5 percent over
the same month in 1987.
   Sumichrast said the strength in the office sector is fueled in
part by insurance companies and pension funds looking to shift
money from the stock and bond markets. Also, foreigners, who have
been accumulating dollars because of the U.S. trade deficit, are
investing in U.S. real estate.
   Government construction projects rose 3.8 percent to an annual
rate of $81.2 billion and included a 12.8 percent jump in highway
construction.
   Factory construction, which had enjoyed strong gains in March,
April and May as manufacturers increased capacity to meet rising
overseas for U.S. goods, fell 0.7 percent to $13.8 billion in July.
   Residential construction overall was up 0.5 percent to an annual
rate of $188.3 billion in July, following three monthly declines.
   Construction of multi-unit housing rose 1.9 percent to $21.8
billion. But construction of single-family homes, which has been
hurt by a steady rise in mortgage interest rates, fell 0.6 percent
to $114.4 billion.
   Shopping center and other commercial projects were off 0.7
percent to $28.5 billion. Hotel and motel construction fell 9.7
percent to $6.5 billion, reversing a 7.5 percent increase in June.

   David Letterman apologized for joking on his
late-night television show about the recent death of Pittsburgh
Steelers founder Art Rooney Sr.
   ``It's terribly sad, and there's a little controversy
surrounding this because he died during the exhibition season. So
does it count?'' the host of NBC's ``Late Night With David
Letterman'' said during Tuesday's show.
   NBC's Pittsburgh affiliate, WPXI-TV, said it received 50 calls
complaining about the joke.
   The apology, made Wednesday night on the show, was directed to
the people of Pittsburgh, Letterman publicist Peter Spivey said in
New York.
   ``It was not my intention to defame the memory of a fine man,''
Letterman said. ``It was poor judgment. My heartfelt apologies to
them.''
   Rooney, 87, died Aug. 25 from complications of a stroke.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci will
depart Washington on Friday for a 10-day trip to Asia, including
six days in China, the Pentagon announced Thursday.
   In China, Carlucci is expected to discuss the prospective export
of U.S. communications satellites for launching on Chinese rockets,
and arms sales also is likely to be on the agenda. He also will
visit Guam and Hong Kong.
   ``In the People's Republic of China, Secretary Carlucci will be
the guest of China's Minister of National Defense Qin Jiwei and
will meet with senior Chinese military and political leaders to
discuss a wide variety of global, regional and bilateral issues,''
the Pentagon said.
   Carlucci will arrive in China on Sept. 5 after a two-day visit
to Guam and remain there until Sept. 10, when he flies to Hong
Kong. The secretary will return to Washington on Sept. 11, the
Pentagon said.
   ``The secretary will make a one-day stop in Hong Kong, and while
there will deliver an address to the Young Presidents'
Organization,'' the Pentagon added.
   The United States has in recent years authorized the sale of
some American arms to China, but the Reagan administration is
currently locked in an internal dispute over whether to send the
high-technology communications satellites to the Chinese.

<TEXT>
   The same Salt Lake City-bound Delta
flight involved in a crash here that killed 13 Wednesday aborted
takeoff today because of an apparent loss of power in one engine,
an airline spokesman said.
   ``Based on the incident that happened yesterday, the captain was
extremely cautious and elected simply to come back to the gate and
let maintenance look at the engine,'' said Bill Berry in Atlanta.
   Flight 1141 _ like the one that crashed, a Boeing 727 _ let off
its passengers after returning to the terminal at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport. They were put on another 727 and sent on
their way about three hours late.
   The flight, which originated in Jackson, Miss., had been
scheduled to leave here at 8:31 a.m. The number of people aboard
was not immediately known.
   Berry said the captain today released the brakes and started his
takeoff roll, reaching about about 30 mph, but ``did not get the
proper readings from one of his engines. He decided to go back to
the gate.''
   ``The captain feels that he had what is called a compressor
stall. There was a crosswind blowing across the runway. That can
interrupt the smoothness of the airflow that goes into the engine,
creating a temporary loss of power. This is very likely what
happened,'' Berry said.
   The 727, like the one that crashed, had Pratt and Whitney
engines, Berry said.
   Don Burkhalter, an assistant U.S. attorney in Jackson who was
aboard the plane, said, ``It was a routine takeoff until we got
almost to the end of the runway. Then we heard what sounded like
bumps and the pilot deaccelerated. He said there was a problem with
the compressors.''
   ``The captain said, and this is a quote, `It's just one of those
things,''' Burkhalter said. ``We just laughed.''
   Burkhalter said a couple of people on today's flight said they
were among the survivors of Wednesday's crash.

<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Thursday
that the presidential campaign between Democrat Michael Dukakis and
Republican George Bush is the most ``superficial'' he's ever seen.
   Cuomo, a Democrat, said Dukakis has attempted to discuss issues
on the campaign trail and he blamed the Republicans for being the
negative campaigners so far.
   ``What are the issues so far? Pledge of Allegiance, furloughs,
death penalty. Are you kidding?'' Cuomo said on a flight from
Albany, N.Y., to Quantico, Va. ``This is so far the most
superficial (campaign) and it is because Republicans have made it
that way. The Republicans are not talking about any big issues so
far.''
   Cuomo said the tone of the campaign was ignoring other important
issues including drugs, national defense, international affairs and
US-Soviet relations.
   ``It's a mean campaign,'' he said, but added he thought it will
become ``great fun'' once the campaign takes off in earnest after
Labor Day.

<TEXT>
   A traveling circus that planned to give a
show for free to prison inmates pulled out at the last minute after
prison authorities said reporters couldn't cover the event, circus
officials said.
   Officials of Circus Vargas charged that authorities at
Stateville Correctional Center reneged on their agreement by
denying media access to the shows after the company complied with
costly personnel and equipment checks.
   John Heber, Circus Vargas director of marketing, said the circus
had planned two performances in the prison recreation yard
Wednesday, but the visit was canceled hours before showtime.
   Officials at the prison declined comment, but Nic Howell,
spokesman for the Illinois Department of Corrections, said he
became aware of the dispute Tuesday afternoon.
   ``The warden told me he was concerned about security, as well he
should be, but the bottom line was that it all was more hassle than
it was worth,'' Howell said.
   In February 1987, a Stateville inmate escaped by riding a movie
crew's truck out of the maximum-security prison during the filming
of ``Weeds,'' starring Nick Nolte.
   Heber said plans for the circus' visit included extensive
discussions with prison officials.
   ``We had done everything they asked,'' he said. ``We even
previewed the show for the assistant warden.
   ``Background checks were done on the 35 performers who would go
into the prison. We gave them a list of every tool. We agreed to
have the trucks stripped and searched.''
   ``Then suddenly they came back Tuesday night and said no media
at all.''
   Heber said the company's president, Clifford Vargas, ``said it
is a free show, and all we were going to get out of it was some
publicity. He said it wasn't fair and canceled the show.''
   The prison houses 1,850 inmates.

   A bomb threat prompted a Northwest
Airlines jet bound for Los Angeles to return to Detroit
Metropolitan Airport today, authorities said.
   The DC-10, carrying 255 people, landed after the pilot informed
the control tower of the threat, said Nancy Mouradian, spokeswoman
for the Wayne County Sheriff's Department.
   The plane was evacuated so it could be searched by
explosive-sniffing dogs and bomb squad officers, the spokeswoman
said.
   ``We are calling it an in-flight bomb threat,'' Mouradian said.
``The pilot phoned it in to the tower so we have to presume the
threat occurred after the plane took off.''
   Mouradian said she didn't know who made the threat or how it was
relayed to the crew.

   Fire swept through an apartment building early
today, killing three people and injuring nine, authorities said.
   The blaze on the city's North Side burned nearly two hours
before it was brought under control shortly after 1 a.m., said Bill
Crowley, a Fire Department spokesman.
   About 125 firefighters helped rescue residents of the
three-story brick building, and as many as 100 people may have been
left homeless, Crowley said.
   Firefighters encountered a language barrier when they arrived
because most of the building's residents were Korean and spoke
little English, the spokesman said.
   Killed were three residents, ages 85, 60 and 35, officials said.
   Crowley said the blaze apparently started on a rear porch.

   A federal appeals court today upheld former
Navy radioman Jerry Whitworth's conviction and 365-year prison
sentence for peddling communications secrets to the Soviet Union as
a member of the Walker family spy ring.
   In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
there was ample evidence that Whitworth, who admitted stealing
cryptographic information but denied knowing its destination, knew
the material was being sold to the Soviets.
   The court also said the sentence, which prohibits parole
consideration for 60 years, ``is not disproportionate to
Whitworth's crimes.''
   John Walker, mastermind of the spy ring, pleaded guilty in
Maryland and was sentenced to life in prison, with parole possible
in 10 years.
   The appeals court today rejected defense arguments that
Whitworth should be treated no more harshly than Walker.
   Alan Caplan, a lawyer for Whitworth, said he would appeal.
   Whitworth was convicted of espionage in 1986.

40 miles inside Pakistani territory Thursday, was a violation of
the four-month-old Geneva agreement on Afghanistan.
   ``The United States condemns this act of aggression against
Pakistan,'' she said. One person was killed and at least 18 were
wounded, she said.
   She added that the United States will raise the issue with the
United Nations and with Soviet authorities. For their part,
Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have accused Pakistan of violating
the Geneva agreement by supporting anti-communist Afghan rebels.
   Mrs. Oakley said it was not clear whether the planes were
piloted by Soviets or Afghans.

   Two men who dug a beached ship out of
the sand face federal charges they damaged the home of the
endangered Alabama beach mouse.
   Thomas Bagwell and Melvin McPherson were cited with vehicle
trespass and damaging critical habitat of an endangered species,
which can net each up to a $500 fine, said Jerome Carroll, manager
of the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge.
   Bagwell said he checked with the sheriff's office before
removing the boat but didn't know he needed permission from the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   He said the removal of the 38-foot vessel in June at request of
its owner actually helped protect the environment because it was
``full of oil and diesel and other debris that would have caused
one heck of a mess.''
   The mouse, which has a buff-colored back a white belly and is 4
inches from head to tail, was added to the Fish and Wildlife
Service list of endangered species in 1985. The mouse numbers in
the hundreds, Carroll said.
   The sand dunes in the refuge are designated by the government as
the ``critical habitat'' of the Alabama beach mouse.
   Bagwell described himself as an environmentalist but said his
concern stops short of rodents.
   ``How would you like to have a rat in your pocket?'' he said.
``You'd stomp it, wouldn't you?''
   Carroll said heavy machines such as a crane and four-wheel drive
vehicles were used to pull the the boat out.

   George Bush today lashed out at Michael Dukakis' environmental
record in his Democratic rival's home state, charging that the
governor has repeatedly fought efforts to make Boston Harbor
cleaner. Dukakis called the Republican nominee a member of the
Reagan administration's ``environmental wrecking crew.''
   While the two presidential candidates traded rhetorical salvos
over the environment, former contender Jesse Jackson denied reports
that aides to Dukakis had told him not to campaign in several
states.
   The Democratic nominee, upon ariving in California Wednesday
night, said that he will be meeting with leaders of the Jackson
campaign, ``who are already becoming a very important part of our
campaign in California.''
   ``The Democratic Party has never been so united as it is this
year,'' Dukakis said.

   Later, in a speech today for the Oakland public school system,
Dukakis criticized his GOP rival for ``playing hooky'' while the
Reagan administration cut education programs.
   ``And where was George while all this was going on? Where was
the man who now says he wants to be the education president? He was
playing hooky. He was nowhere to be found,'' Dukakis said in
prepared remarks.
   He charged the Reagan administration has eliminated remedial
math and reading programs for 500,000 poor children, while in
Massachusetts he started an ``essential skills'' program. The
Reagan administration sought cuts in the remedial programs in 1981
but was unsuccessful. In an April 1988 report, the Education
Department said the number of children in remedial programs had
dropped from 5 million in 1979-80 to 4.5 million in the 1985-86
school year.

   Bush, who took an early morning boat tour of the polluted harbor
in Dukakis' hometown, said Dukakis had sought permission from
former Environmental Protection Agency administrator William
Ruckelshaus to delay a ban on dumping wastes in the harbor.
Dukakis' first administration prepared the papers to do so, but it
was his successor, Ed King, who actually filed the EPA request.
   ``Two hundred years ago tea was spilled in the Boston harbor in
the name of liberty,'' the vice president said. ``If tea were
spilled in the Boston harbor today it would desolve in the residue
of my opponent's neglect and delay.''
   While campaigning in his opponent's backyard, Bush was greeted
by about 70 Dukakis supporters who chanted, ``Where was George?'' _
a refrain questioning Bush's role in the Reagan administration.
   A new national poll, meanwhile, shows Bush and Dukakis in a dead
heat, but a 2-to-1 sentiment that the Democratic vice presidential
nominee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, is more qualified than Sen.
Dan Quayle of Indiana, the Republican nominee for the No. 2 slot.
   Another poll found Dukakis running even against Bush in
Massachusetts, two months after the governor led the Republican
nominee by 14 percentage points in a similar survey.
   In the Boston Herald poll of 400 likely Massachusetts voters
conducted Wednesday, Dukakis and Bush were tied at 42 percent each
with 15 percent undecided and one percent favoring other candidates.
   ``I can't believe it _ in Massachusetts?'' a pleased Bush
responded when shown the newspaper headline.
   Bush, who aides said was trying to separate himself from Reagan
administration policies on the environment, began touting the new
theme Wednesday during an appearance on the shore of Lake Erie in
Michigan.
   Promising swift action on acid rain if elected, Bush also said
he would convene a global conference during his first year in
office to address the problem of the warming of the atmosphere. He
further called for wetlands protection and pledged a policy of
``zero tolerance'' for polluters.
   ``I am an environmentalist, always have been, from my earliest
days growing up and then as a congressman ... and I always will
be,'' he said in Michigan.
   Dukakis on Wednesday shifted blame to the Reagan administration,
saying it tried to eliminate federal funding for waste treatment
plants, and called Bush an election-year convert to the
environmental cause.
   ``I understand Mr. Bush was in Michigan talking about the
environment,'' Dukakis said. ``Coming from somebody who was a
charter member of the environmental wrecking crew which went to
Washington in 1981, that's very strange indeed.''
   Dukakis is campaigning today on the West Coast in an effort to
win back conservative Democrats who voted for President Reagan in
the last two elections.
   In Atlanta, Jackson was meeting with a number of key supporters
a week after meeting quietly with the Dukakis camp.
   Jackson met with Dukakis aides in Washington last week and was
reportedly angered by the suggestion he stay out of several states.
According to one participant in the discussions, who asked not to
be identified, the request was withdrawn.
   The Dukakis campaign denied such a suggestion was made and
Jackson, in an appearance on ``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``No, that
never has happened.''
   ``I would assume that there will be a lot of focus between now
and Labor Day _ the time is getting late _ to determine whether
there will be targeted states, where priorities will be,'' Jackson
said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   Dukakis and Jackson made a pact at the Democratic convention in
Atlanta in July that essentially was designed to give the Jackson
constituency and its issues a voice in the Democratic general
election campaign.
   Both Bush and Dukakis came out just about even in the newest
poll, but the survey also found that Bush's attacking campaign
style has yet to win over the Reagan Democrats.
   According to the ABC-Washington Post poll released Wednesday,
Dukakis led Bush 48 percent to 47 percent, a statistical dead heat
because of the 3.5-point margin of error.
   Bush's harsh attacks on Dukakis' patriotism and defense
positions have had no effect on Dukakis' lead among the Reagan
Democrats, who favor Dukakis 58-34.
   The survey also found twice as many voters thought Democratic
vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen was more qualified than
Quayle.
   The survey of 1,129 registered, likely voters was begun last
Wednesday and ended Tuesday.

   Five years after West Europeans
took to the streets in massive anti-missile protests, the United
States on Thursday began removing its intermediate-range rockets in
accordance with a superpower treaty signed last year.
   A truck convoy hauled nine Pershing 2 missiles from a base near
Stuttgart, and U.S. officials said they would remove the remaining
420 medium- and shorter-range missiles from Western Europe in the
next 36 months.
   ``This is an important event in post-war history,'' West German
government spokesman Friedhelm Ost told a news conference in Bonn.
   The stationing of the missiles had sparked huge protests in
Western Europe, including a coordinated demonstration in several
cities that drew hundreds of thousands of people in October 1983.
Deployment of the missiles began the following month.
   But the anti-missile fervor waned, and by the time President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed their treaty
banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles in December, only a
handful of protesters was still active in West Germany.
   A group of anti-missile activists who came to witness the
removal applauded as the 15 U.S. Army trucks carrying the missiles
left the Heilbronn site in southern Germany, about 35 miles north
of Stuttgart.
   They held up a banner saying ``Heilbronn, Never Again A Nuclear
Powder Keg.''
   One 66-year-old woman who had taken part in dozens of protests
said: ``We have fought, trembled, sung and cried. We were arrested
and taken off in buses. But we've always renewed our courage.'' She
declined to give her name.
   A rocket motor explosion at Heilbronn in January 1985 killed
three U.S. soldiers and injured 16 others. West German news reports
said the accident led then-Defense Minister Manfred Woerner to
promise residents that Heilbronn would be the first site from which
missiles would be removed.
   U.S. Navy Cmdr. Gerry Ryan of European Command Headquarters in
Stuttgart told The Associated Press: ``It's the first time that
U.S. intermediate-range missiles have been withdrawn in Europe.
   ``The remainder of the U.S. Army European-based,
intermediate-range nuclear missiles are scheduled to be removed
over a 36-month period,'' he added.
   The Soviet Union began removing its missiles from Czechoslovakia
and East Germany in February, before the U.S. Senate had ratified
the treaty.
   East Germany's official news agency ADN said in March that the
Soviets had completed the removal of all 54 shorter-range SS-12
missiles, but said nothing about the 53 SS-23 missiles also covered
by the treaty.
   The official Czechoslovak news agency CTK reported in July that
all of the 39 SS-12 shorter-range missiles based in that country
had been removed in February and March.
   Original NATO plans called for 572 intermediate-range nuclear
missiles in five West European countries to counter the Soviet
rockets pointed at the West.
   But the United States ultimately deployed only 429 missiles in
West Germany, Britain, Italy and Belgium after plans to station the
rockets in the Netherlands were scrapped.
   Of those deployed, 108 Pershing 2 missiles and 96 cruise
missiles were stationed at four bases in West Germany.
   One part of the convoy carrying the U.S. missiles headed to a
U.S. Army post in Frankfurt, while another was heading to a
different base ``in preparation for air transport back to
elimination sites in the United States,'' Ryan said.
   U.S. officials have said that some of the rockets would be
destroyed at the Frankfurt site, and that the nuclear warheads
would be shipped back ``to the appropriate authority,'' in the
United States.
   Under terms of the treaty, the Soviet Union and United States
agreed to eliminate all land-based nuclear missiles that have a
range from 300 to 3,000 miles.

   The founder of the Just Say No anti-drug
movement championed by Nancy Reagan has quit the organization in a
dispute with its new leaders.
   Joan Brann, who established the first Just Say No club and
helped give a theme to the first lady's anti-drug crusade, resigned
as national vice president and shut down the local office here
Wednesday.
   The dispute started in February, when W.W. Abbott, senior vice
president of Procter & Gamble Co., became chairman of the national
Just Say No Foundation.
   Abbott declared the organization was about $600,000 in debt and
needed more professional management than it was getting from Brann
or from Tom Adams, foundation president, who has since resigned.
   The board also decided it could no longer afford to underwrite
the local Just Say No office in Oakland.
   ``I can't understand why they would close us down practically
without warning,'' said Brann.
   Ivy Cohen, a former P&G employee who runs the foundation's
national headquarters in Walnut Creek, said other Just Say No
offices are operated by volunteers and are self-sufficient.
   ``The only local office the national foundation was paying for
was Oakland's,'' she said. ``And that made up a big chunk of our
deficit.

   Iran brainwashed Iraqi prisoners of war,
turning many into fanatical supporters of Iran, and many POWs from
both nations are afraid to return home, a U.N. report said Thursday.
   The prisoners fear interrogation about their loyalty to their
homeland becaue they surrendered, said the report by three U.N.
experts who visited Iranian and Iraqi POW camps in late July and
early August.
   Similar problems accompanied negotiations for the voluntary
return of prisoners that prolonged the Korean War for more than a
year until April 1953.
   Iran and Iraq, now under a U.N.-brokered cease-fire in their
eight-year war, are deadlocked in peace talks in Geneva over the
withdrawal of forces and rights to the Shatt-al-Arab waterway
forming their border. The talks also are supposed to arrange the
prompt repatriation of prisoners.
   The U.N. experts are Maj. Gen. Rene Bats of the Belgian army and
international law professors Wolfram Karl of the University of
Salzburg, Austria, and Torkel Opsahl of the University of Oslo,
Norway.
   ``In both countries we learned that one set of POWs was used to
influence or inform upon another,'' they said in their report.
   POW camps in Iran were dominated by Iraqi prisoners who swore
allegiance to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and denounced
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein as an atheist, the report said.
   ``Cultural Committees'' in the camps provided religious and
political instruction called ``spiritual guidance,'' it said.
   ``To us, it is indistinguishable from mental pressure,'' it said.
   ``Many POWs stated that the `guidance' took the form of
brainwashing, putting them under permanently heavy mental
pressure,'' the U.N. team said. ``The results of the treatment are
striking.
   ``In each camp we visited, there were fanatical, hysterical and
sometimes violent demonstrations by the prisoners, who were
assembled inside along the barbed-wire fences'' shouting
pro-Khomeini slogans and denouncing Hussein and the superpowers,
the report said.
   About half the camp residents joined the rallies, but the U.N.
team observed that a zealous Shiite minority of 10 or 20 percent of
the prisoners dominated the rest.
   Iranian authorities said that system developed because they
allow the Iraqi prisoners considerable autonomy in the camp.
   Any Iraqi POW who took part in anti-Hussein demonstrations might
well worry about having to explain his actions when debriefed after
repatriation, particularly if another POW informed the Iraqi
authorities.
   Iranians also are worried about repatriating Iraqi prisoners,
the report said.
   ``There is a risk that riots may break out, for example in the
moment when transfer is to take place with a view to registration
and repatriation,'' it said.
   In Iraq, the U.N. team found Iranian POWs were also worried
about going home.
   The report said Iranian POWs had divided loyalties. Some favored
the Khomeini government, some preferred the pre-revolutionary
government of the Shah of Iran, and some were loyal to the
Mujahedeen Khalq rebels fighting Khomeini.
   ``The majority, however, seemed inclined to return to Iran,
provided they were given effective guarantees that they would not
be subject to persecution on their return. In the absence of such
guarantees, however, their future looks gloomy,'' the U.N. team
said.
   The U.N. team's main criticism of Iraq's POW camps was
occasional abuse by guards. They found no proof of systematic
indoctrination.
   The U.N. investigators estimated that Iran may be holding up to
70,000 POWs, and Iraq may have about 35,000 prisoners.

   United States and Soviet Union should halt
production of a key component of nuclear weapons as a way of pacing
cuts in their arsenals, according to a group of arms control
specialists.
   In an article to be published Friday in the journal Science, the
group called for stopping further production of tritium, a hydrogen
isotope that decays at a rate of 5.5 percent yearly. Tritium is a
component of the modern, compact nuclear warheads deployed by the
superpowers.
   A nuclear weapons scientist from Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, however, responded that the proposal poses numerous
problems and could complicate U.S.-Soviet arms talks.
   Advocating the ``Tritium Factor'' as a means of arms control
were four specialists, headed by J. Carson Mark, associated with
the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based policy group.
Mark is former leader of the theoretical division at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.
   Mark contended that ``the 5.5 percent annual decay of tritium
could serve as a `forcing function' to produce steady, verifiable
reductions in the superpowers' nuclear arsenals. Such reductions
would result in a comprehensive 50 percent cut in warheads by about
12 years after an agreement _ the year 2001, if the cutoff were to
begin now.''
   Mutual suspension of new tritium production, he wrote, would
represent ``a shared commitment to keep reductions in nuclear
armaments going at a steady pace.''
   Mark noted that such a halt also would ``allay safety concerns
on both sides associated with continuing to operate their aging
production reactors.''
   The P-Reactor at the Department of Energy's Savannah River Plant
near Aiken, S.C., which produces both tritium and plutonium, was
shut down last month after undergoing a sudden power surge while
workers were attempting to restart the reactor. The plant's two
other production reactors currently are also shut down, one for
maintenance and the other due to safety concerns.
   With a halt in tritium production, Mark said, expensive plans to
upgrade and eventually replace these reactors could be set aside.
``The production reactors of both sides would be placed on standby,
ready to restart tritium production only if nuclear arms talks
break down,'' he wrote.
   Mark said an agreement to halt nuclear materials production
could be verified by reconnaissance satellites monitoring
heat-generated infrared radiation at the facilities.
   ``Any undeclared source of thermal radiation could be challenged
as a potential clandestine facility and made subject to on-site
inspection,'' he argued.
   In a rebuttal published alongside Mark's proposal, W.G.
Sutcliffe, a scientist with the evaluation and planning program at
Lawrence Livermore, said that ``any proposal to limit nuclear
materials as a means of arms control is premature.''
   He contended that ``asymmetries in nuclear materials production
capabilities, design practices and delivery system capabilities
could lead to disparate impacts on the U.S. and Soviet stockpiles,
possibly leaving the U.S. in a vulnerable position.''
   ``Proposing nuclear materials limits is fraught with great
uncertainties about the comparability of effects on the two
stockpiles and verification issues because of the unknowns about
the Soviet stockpile and production capabilities,'' Sutcliffe said.
   Noting that early nuclear weapons did not use tritium, he said
that ``as a result of the inevitable research efforts, new
technology might circumvent or reduce the need for tritium in
efficient modern warheads.''
   Co-authoring the Mark article were Paul L. Leventhal, president
of the Nuclear Control Institute; Milton M. Hoenig, the institute's
scientific director, and retired Rear Adm. Thomas D. Davies, former
assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

   The United States is concerned about reports
that Iraq may have used chemical weapons in a campaign to suppress
Kurdish rebel groups, the State Department said Thursday.
   ``If the reports are accurate, this is a grave violation of
international human rights standards,'' said spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley, noting that use of chemical weapons was condemned in a U.N.
Security Council resolution approved last week.
   She commended the Turkish government for offering temporary
shelter to Kurdish refugees.
   The Turkish government said Wednesday that 20,000 Kurdish
refugees have been allowed into Turkey from northeastern Iraq,
where Kurdish rebels said the Baghdad government has launched its
biggest offensive.
   The Kurds seek autonomy and sided with Iran during the Persian
Gulf war.
   In Geneva, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Wednesday the
world body was taking no action following allegations of the
chemical attacks, saying there was no independent confirmation. The
United Nations has condemned Iraq for use of chemical weapons
during the Iran-Iraq war.

   A Muscovy duck's attack on a
city commissioner and his family has reeding and
education.
   ``She sees him as the light at the end of the tunnel. If she can
just get her foot into the door, she'll be OK. She gets out of this
horrible life she's been leading. To her, he's everything that she
wants to be.''
   McCarthy played opposite Ringwald in ``Pretty In Pink.'' In both
films, his character has a a wealthier background than Ringwald's.
   ``It was a big question in all our minds before we started the
film. Are people going to see this as `Pretty in Pink II'? ''
Ringwald said. ``It's stupid, I'm a good actress and he's a good
actor and we're good together. Once we dove in and started working,
`Pretty in Pink' never came up.''
   Ringwald admitted to being nervous about handling the role of
Jewel.
   ``I didn't know if I could play that character,'' she said. ``I
read `Pretty in Pink,' and I thought, `I could do this in my
sleep.' With Jewel, I wondered if it was possible for me to be
sexy.''
   Jewel's experiences are considerably different from Ringwald's.
   ``I think you have to use your imagination to a large degree,''
she said. ``I've never been raped. I didn't grow up the way she
did. I had to use research, meet people, look through pictures.
Just get a feel for it and use your imagination.
   ``Jewel is not as educated as I am, but she knows exactly what's
going on.''
   Ringwald did manage to find common emotional ground with her
character.
   ``I related to her insecurity. A lot of people don't know what I
have to be insecure about,'' the actress said. ``Anybody, when they
fall in love, is insecure. Do they think I'm attractive? Do they
think I'm smart? What affects Jewel is her insecurity.''
   Unlike most people her age, Ringwald can look back at a lengthy
career. She began acting in 1977, playing Kate in the West Coast
stage production of ``Annie.'' In 1982, she made her film debut in
Paul Mazursky's ``Tempest'' and earned a Golden Globe nomination
for best actress.
   Ringwald recently saw ``Tempest'' on television and couldn't get
over how much her acting had changed.
   ``My voice was a lot higher,'' she said. ``I was all over the
place. I wasn't always in control. I wasn't aware of what I was
doing. I was paying attention, then not paying attention. I'm a lot
more focused than I used to be.''
   What about the future? What does Molly Ringwald see herself
doing in the 1990s?
   ``Everybody worries about where they're going to be in 10 years.
I always wonder where I'm going to be. I could be married, raising
children. Anything's possible.''
   Would she still be like to be acting?
   ``It wouldn't be the worst thing.''

<HEAD>Productivity, Purchasing Power Down Despite Higher Wages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor costs rose, productivity fell and
workers, despite higher wages, lost some of their purchasing power
in the second quarter, the government said Thursday. Analysts
called the report a warning flag of inflation and more difficult
economic times.
   In revised figures for April through June, the Labor Department
said the efficiency of non-farm businesses in churning out goods
and services dropped at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, its first
quarterly decline since 1986.
   Labor costs, meanwhile, shot up at an annual rate of 5.7 percent
_ the biggest increase since 1986 _ reflecting the productivity
declines and wage and benefit increases averaging 4.2 percent
annually.
   Charles Renfro of Alaphametrics, an economic forecasting firm in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the figures indicate that an ``inflationary
head of steam is building.''
   ``Some rise in unit labor costs and a decrease in productivity
is a reflection of an economy that is beginning to battle itself,''
he said. ``The question really is what's going to hit first: a
recession or an inflationary period followed by recession.''
   The Labor Department had earlier put the productivity decline
among non-farm businesses responsible for three-fourths of the
nation's economic activity at a worse 1.7 percent.
   However, that was before the government last week revised
economic growth figures for the second quarter upward from 3.1
percent to 3.3 percent annually.
   With the higher growth, output of goods and service by non-farm
businesses in the private sector increased 5.2 percent instead of
the 4.7 percent estimated earlier.
   But to achieve that increased output, businesses had to raise
the number of hours worked by their employees by 6.6 percent.
   Analysts said the increase in hours and conseqent decrease in
productivty reflects a hiring boom in which employers at a time of
decade-low unemployment are having to use less-skilled workers more.
   ``If the marginal labor is less skilled, the result is going to
be some productivity declines,'' said Renfro. ``We may have moved
to a point where we have absorbed all of labor's skilled capacity.
That is one of the things that usually characterizes an
inflationary period.''
   Roger Brinner of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., said
employers were ``overzealous'' in hiring last spring, predicting a
slight increase in the unemployment rate the second half of this
year.
   ``There will not be any decrease in employment; there just won't
be the large increases there have been,'' he said. ``The cyclical
boost to productivity is over and we need to run the economy at
idle speed for a while rather than at the fast pace we did in
1987.''
   Despite the second-quarter decline, businesses are still 1.6
percent more efficient than they were a year ago, according to the
Labor Department numbers, and labor costs over the 12 months are up
just 2.9 percent.
   ``Essentially, productivity is still moving upward, although the
trend is becoming somewhat discouraging,'' said Larry Chimerine of
the WEFA Group, another Bala Cynwyd consulting group.
   ``Productivity is the number one economic issue in the country
right now because it is what determines whether living standards
improve,'' Chimerine said. ``The presidential candidates should be
debating how to improve it, but they aren't,'' he complained.
   The Labor Department said hourly wages and benefits nominally
rose at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter. But
after taking inflation into account, the buying power of each hour
of work declined 0.6 percent, the first drop in real compensation
for workers in a year.
   The 5.7 percent increase in labor costs, compared with just a
0.1 percent rise in the first quarter, was the largest since that
last quarter of 1986, when it rose 6.1 percent.
   While businesses as a whole turned less efficient, the
rebounding manufacturing sector continued to show large
productivity gains, at an annual pace of 3.6 percent in the second
quarter atop a 3.4 percent increase in 1987.
   ``Thanks to the restructuring that took place in the 1980s,
manufacturing productivity is better than it has been in four
decades,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist for Merrill Lynch.
``But in the services area where most people are employed it has
been dismal, despite huge investments in computers and office
equipment.''

   A French woman linked to terrorists
who killed 12 people at the 1972 Olympics in Munich was deported
soon after she arrived in South Korea, where the 1988 Olympics
begin Sept. 17, officials said Thursday.
   Officials at Kimpo International Airport said the 40-year-old
woman was suspected of ties to the Black September terrorist group.
Her name was not released.
   The woman was deported to Tokyo, from where she had arrived
Tuesday. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused
to disclose other details, including when the woman was deported.
   Black September, believed to be affiliated with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, has been involved in several terrorist
attacks, including an attack at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, West
Germany.
   Black September terrorists opened fire at an Olympic housing
area in Munich, killing 11 Israelis and one West German policeman.
Fiver terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with West
German troops.
   With almost all sports and related facilities ready, security is
emerging as one of the most serious problems for the Olympics in
Seoul opening Sept. 17.
   South Korean officials, fearing international terrorist groups
might try to disrupt the Olympics, are enforcing rigid security
measures at all ports of entry.
   Several known or suspected members of the Japanese Red Army
terrorist group have been arrested in Japan and other countries in
recent months. One of them, Osamu Maruoka, had a one-way ticket to
Seoul.
   On Friday, a Korean resident of Japan was arrested at the Kimpo
airport for trying to smuggle four pistols and 21 rounds of
ammunition concealed in a suitcase.
   Police said they were investigating whether the man, Kim
Sung-sik, 50, had any connections with domestic or international
terrorist groups trying to disrupt the Olympics.
   A few days before the 1986 Asian Games in Seoul, a bomb went off
at the Kimpo airport, killing five people. South Korea blamed North
Korea for the attack.

<TEXT>
   The Republicans won Lady Liberty's hand for
the traditional Labor Day kickoff of their presidential campaign,
but the Democrats will try to steal their thunder with a visit to
neighboring Ellis Island two days earlier.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, the GOP vice presidential nominee, beat the
other candidates in reserving both Liberty and Ellis islands in New
York harbor for campaign ceremonies all day Monday, the official
Labor Day holiday.
   ``They were there first,'' said Edie Shean-Hammond of Boston, a
spokeswoman for the National Park Service which is custodian of
both politically popular landmarks.
   Liberty Island is the site of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island is where millions of European immigrants were processed for
entry into the United States in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries.
   But Dukakis reserved Ellis Island for a Saturday morning
appearance with his mother, the former Euterpe Boukis, who arrived
there from Greece as a young girl in 1913 with her immigrant
parents and sisters.
   Quayle, whose ancestors did not pass through Ellis, won the race
for Liberty and Ellis islands when his aides tracked down park
superintendent Kevin Buckley in Washington on Thursday and reserved
both sites for Labor Day.
   Ms. Shean-Hammond said reservations for the popular sites are
granted on a ``first-come, first-served'' basis to avoid charges of
favoritism. ``We have to play this really close to the book,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin today proposed
excluding drug offenders from the house arrest program that allowed
John Zaccaro Jr. to serve his cocaine trafficking term in a
$1,500-a-month luxury apartment.
   ``We must have public confidence in the system,'' the governor
said. ``We have to send a very strong message to drug dealers.
   The move came in part from the outcry over the Corrections
Department's decision to allow the 24-year-old son of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro to participate in the
program, which allows non-violent criminals to find their own
housing and serve their sentences outside prison under supervision.
   Zaccaro was convicted in April of selling $25 worth of cocaine
to an undercover officer. He was sentenced to four months in jail
but allowed to enter the house arrest program after less than an
hour in prison.
   Later it was learned he was serving his time in a hotel-style
luxury apartment with cable television and a linen service.
   Kunin defended the program overall, saying it provided
punishment while alleviating prison overcrowding, but proposed
changes under which drug offenders like Zaccaro would be considered
more serious criminals and thus be excluded.
   ``I think anyone who sells drugs ... is a serious offender,''
Kunin said.
   Kunin said the original guidelines for the program were drafted
in 1983, and many assumptions about drug offenses had changed since
then.
   Other changes Kunin proposed would require all offenders in the
program to spend at least 24 hours in jail.
   She said she would also ask corrections officials to address
equity in the program so that the poor would not be excluded
because they could not come up with suitable accomodations and the
rich are not favored with more luxurious conditions.
   ``Hallelujah!'' Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said
upon learning of Kunin's proposal. Quinn prosecuted Zaccaro and
opposed allowing him him into the house arrest program.
   ``I never considered that drug dealers were non-violent
offenders,'' he said. ``I never thought they should be in the house
arrest program no matter who they are.''

<DATELINE>BORSHILLA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kushum sat motionless on the heap
of rotting straw and two corrugated tin sheets that once was her
house and stared at the floodwaters that swept away her only child.
   Her 5-year-old son, Rahim, was one of seven children who drowned
when the Ganges River, swollen with floodwaters coursing down from
the Himalayan foothills in neighboring India, inundated this
village of 500 people about 70 miles west of Dhaka.
   Since the rainy season started in June, more than 680 people
have died in Bangladesh, the New Nation and other Dhaka newspapers
said Thursday. The government, whose toll is generally considered
to be understated, puts the toll at 250.
   The government estimates the floods have displaced 25 million
people, nearly one-fourth of Bangladesh's population.
   Village elders in Borshilla said Thursday the village was
flooded Aug. 22, when Kushum's son and the other children drowned,
and the water has been rising ever since.
   For the past week Kushum has refused to move from the spot where
she last saw her son.
   Khaleque Bhiyan, one of the leaders, said many villagers fled to
stay with relatives in Pabna, 30 miles northwest of here.
   Some of those who remained were stricken with dysentery but were
recovering with the help of medicine brought by relief workers from
Pabna.
   Blackish water stood up to 4 feet deep in many parts of
Borshilla. People cried, almost in unison: ``Please send us
drinking water and cooked food! We don't want anything else!''
   In Pabna, deputy magistrate Khairul Alam said government
storehouses in the region contained enough food to feed flood
victims in the region but there were not enough boats to get it to
them.
   ``What we need most urgently are boats to rescue thousands of
people marooned in far-flung areas and to provide relief to the
flood victims,'' he said.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad issued an international appeal
for boats and grain.
   On Thursday, government officials and a reporter were flown by
helicopter to Pabna from the capital, Dhaka, 75 miles to the east.
The aircraft passed over villages where only roofs were visible.
   Occasionally, twisted railroad tracks could be seen through the
water.
   ``The flood is playing havoc with life and property in 39 of the
country's 64 districts,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman said
in Pabna.
   ``We need international help in meeting the emergency,'' he
said. ``We want 2 million tons of grain either as a grant or a
loan. We are even prepared to buy some of it.''
   Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest nations. Its 109
million people _ a figure recently revised by the government from
105 million _ have a per capita income of about $150 a year.
   Floods bring annual disasters to the low-lying country, where
mighty rivers like the Ganges dwarf the fields between them.
   Last year more than 1,500 people died in the summer monsoons,
and in 1985 more than 10,000 people were killed by cyclones and
tidal waves along the Bay of Bengal.
   In Dhaka, the flooding Buriganga River has submerged one-fourth
of the city under water ranging from an inch to 5 feet. But so far
no deaths have been reported in the capital.
   The city of 4 million is virtually isolated from the rest of the
country. The Ministry of Communications said 18 highways leading
out of Dhaka were closed because of flooding.

<HEAD>US Won't Offer Leases if Best Areas Banned by Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department won't offer oil and
gas leases off Massachusetts in the coming fiscal year if a
congressional ban on leasing the best areas goes forward, an
official said Thursday.
   Opponents of drilling are mistaken because the Georges Bank
areas of the North Atlantic most likely contains gas, far less
environmentally damaging in an accident than crude oil, said
William Bettenberg, director of the department's Minerals
Management Service.
   Core sample drilling carried out last spring by Texas A&M
University would not be permitted under a new provision of the
congressional ban, although seismic work still could continue, he
said.
   Bettenberg told reporters that the appropriations bill approved
by a House-Senate conference committee placing waters less than
1,312 feet deep (400 meters) off-limits leaves nothing worth
offering at an auction.
   Action on the bill is expected after Congress returns next week.
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has said he would recommend a veto,
but Bettenberg said he did not know whether President Reagan would
do so.
   The ban, if it becomes law, would expand the off-limits area to
5.5 million acres from 3.2 million in previous years' prohibitions
limited to areas less than 656 feet (200 meters) deep.
   ``At this point nobody has produced at 400 meters,'' Bettenberg
said. ``Interest beyond 400 meters lies somewhere between small and
negligible.''
   The deepest offshore well is in the Gulf of Mexico at about
1,000 feet or 300 meters.
   When the smaller moratorium was in effect in 1985, the Interior
Department held a lease auction for the area and received no bids.
   Although estimates vary, the department believes there is a 30
percent chance of finding commercially valuable oil or gas in the
moratorium area, and if any is there, the odds are 50-50 that there
is 1 trillion cubic feet of gas but only a remote chance of oil.
   ``We think of the North Atlantic as essentially a gas
province,'' Bettenberg said.
   Environmental damage from an offshore gas well would be ``even
less than oil,'' said Carolita Kallaor, assistant director for
offshore operations. Bettenberg said it would be ``virtually
none,'' although an explosion could endanger workers.
   While gas wells usually produce liquid as well as gas, ``it
evaporates,'' he said.
   Asked if opponents of Georges Bank drilling were wrong to stress
the dangers of oil spills, Bettenberg said, ``We think so.''
   Georges Bank is one of the world's most productive fishing
areas, and fishing interests, strongly backed by environmental
groups and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee, for years have vigorously opposed drilling.
   Congress has responded with a series of year-long bans on
leasing, frequently coupled with prohibitions covering parts of the
waters off Florida and California as in this year's bill.
   In an effort to head off another ban, Hodel earlier had
announced a delay in North Atlantic lease offering of about six
months from February 1989.
   Bettenberg said Texas A&M was under contract to oil companies
for its core sampling and any findings, while made available to the
department, were proprietary and could not be made public.
   Previous congressional action has not mentioned core sampling
and seismic exploration, Bettenberg said, and the new bill would
specifically permit seismic work while banning core drilling in the
moratorium areas.

<HEAD>Airline Fire Protection Effort Still Stalled After Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to protect airline passengers from
rapidly spreading post-crash fires, such as the one that swept
through the Delta Air Lines jet in Texas, remain stalled after more
than a decade of frustrating research.
   Four years ago, the Federal Aviation Administration was on the
verge of requiring airliners to use a special fuel additive which
its supporters said would stop aircraft fuel vapors from igniting
in a crash.
   Although the anti-misting additive suppressed the spread of
flames in repeated static tests, a highly publicized test using a
remote-controlled Boeing 720 in the California desert failed
miserably in November 1984, as the deliberately crashed jet was
engulfed in a ball of flames.
   The failed test came only weeks before a regulation requiring
the additive was to have been announced, although the airlines had
argued the additive's value was questionable and there were
indications it could interfere with engine performance.
   Eleven months later, after the government and chemical industry
and spent millions of dollars on the research, the FAA abandoned
the fuel additive idea because the agency said ``the concept is not
practical for day-to-day airline operation in the foreseeable
future.''
   According to government figures, about 40 percent of the
fatalities in potentially survivable airline crashes are caused by
flames or the inhalation of toxic smoke.
   Most of the 13 people killed in the crash Wednesday of Delta
Flight 1141 as it was taking off from the Dallas-Fort Worth airport
were believed to have died from the flames and smoke, according to
investigators. It is believed that many more might have perished if
the plane had not ripped apart in three places, allowing passengers
to more rapidly escape.
   Concern about the danger of fire after crashes has been raised
by aviation safety experts for years. Research into ways to reduce
the threat gained momentum in 1977 after the fiery collision of two
Boeing 747 jumbo jets on a fog-bound runway at Tenerife in the
Canary Islands killed 553 people.
   For six years after the Tenerife crash the FAA's focus was on
developing a polymer called Avgard, which was supposed to prevent
the misting of jet fuel and thereby prevent the fireball that often
engulfs a jet when fuel lines are severed in a crash.
   The FAA estimated at one point that as many as 135 lives a year
could be saved if the polymer were used as a fuel additive by all
commercial airlines. A British company, Imperial Chemical
Industries, invested more than $15 million in develping Avgard
prior to the ill-fated test in the California desert in 1984.
   When fuel lines are severed or fuel tanks rupture in a crash,
jet fuel often turns into a mist of small droplets that can readily
explode into a fireball when exposed to heat or flames. The polymer
was hoped to prevent the misting.
   ``There hasn't been any research done by the FAA on (the
anti-mist polymer) since the crash test in 1984,'' said agency
spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane.
   In recent years, the FAA has explored other methods aimed at
reducing the danger of fuel fires after crashes and has taken
actions to reduce the fire danger inside airline cabins.
   Airlines have been required to install fire-blocking seat covers
that allow passengers as much as 40 additional seconds to escape
before being exposed to toxic fumes and smoke. Airlines also have
had to install low-level emerency lights to help guide passengers
from smoke-filled cabins.
   Last year Congress directed the FAA to conduct a special
one-year study on ways to prevent fiery, fuel-fed explosions after
a plane crashes. A draft report on the agency's findings is
expected later this month.
   According to FAA officials, the report is not expected to revive
research into the anti-misting fuel additive program, but focus on
varous ways of making aircraft fuel systems more crash resistant.

<TEXT>
   Rescue crews reached the wreckage of a
commuter plane that crashed in a remote section of the western
Sierra Madre and said all 20 people aboard died, a military
official said today.
   Bad weather had hampered the search for the twin-engine plane.
   A helicopter owned by the Federal Electricity Commission spotted
the wreckage at 9 p.m. Wednesday about 210 miles southwest of
Mexico City.
   Helicopters were unable to fly in the area again until late this
morning and army and civilian rescuers hiked to the rugged
mountainside site.
   ``They found the plane. They have located the bodies and the
parts (of both) are dispersed in an area with a radius of about 50
meters (yards),'' Gen. Carmelo Teran, chief of staff of the 21st
military zone, said.
   ``They have found no survivors,'' he said. He spoke by telephone
from Morelia, capital of Michoacan state where the crash occurred.
   The flight left Uruapan on Wednesday morning for the 100-mile
flight to Lazaro Cardenas, said Adalberto Mandes, director of the
Uruapan airport. He said most of the 17 passengers and three crew
members were from Uruapan.
   The plane was a Brazilian-made Badeirante belonging to the small
Mexican airline Aerofederal, a federal aviation inspector contacted
at the airline in Mexico City said.
   Rescuers left Arteaga, 40 miles north of Lazaro Cardenas, at 7
a.m. on what was estimated to be a six-hour trip, most of it on
foot, to the crash site on heavily forested El Calero Hill,
spokesmen in the mayors offices of Arteaga and Lazaro Cardenas said.
   ``It's 15 kilometers (nine miles) to where they leave the
vehicles. Then they climb the hill. There are lots of rocks. You
can't walk well,'' said Jesus Gutierrez, an assistant to the
Arteaga mayor.
   He said weather conditions improved enough this morning for
helicopters to take off from Arteaga.
   Francisco Javier Flores, Lazaro Cardenas city secretary, said
the area had been lashed by Hurricane Kristy for the past two days
and it had been raining for about four days.
   ``Yesterday (Wednesday) morning there were strong winds in
Lazaro Cardenas but I don't know if they were strong where the
accident occurred,'' he said.
   The inspector in Mexico City, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said land and helicopter crews from the government Civil
Aeronatics Department were among those heading for the site.
   About 100 soldiers backed by helicopters were moving into the
area, 10 miles south of the town of Arteaga, Teran said.
   ``We only have information from people who live in the area.
Some say they heard noise. Some saw the plane pass,'' Teran said.
   Ricardo Alvarez, a worker with the Electricity Commission in
Lazaro Cardenas, said Wednesday that people in El Tahuazal, a
nearby village, had reported a loud explosion, and Mandes said
Federal Highway Police and army troops then began a search.
   Mandes said the Lazaro Cardenas airport had no radar or air
communications facilities that could have helped controllers track
the plane.
   Aerofederal is a government-owned, cargo transport airline that
also services regional passenger routes.

<HEAD>Interior Official Sees Oil Production Doubled by 1992</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil production from federal waters off
California should double by 1992, an Interior Department official
said Thursday.
   William Bettenberg, director of the department's Minerals
Management Service, said production from platforms for which
permits already had been granted should bring the total to 200,000
to 225,000 barrels a day.
   Current California production is about 100,000 barrels a day,
nearly twice the 53,700 barrels a day in 1981 and almost quadruple
the 27,900 barrels a day in 1980.
   Federal waters currently hold 16 producing platforms, and 22
should be in operation in 1992 after additions and retirements,
officials said.
   Almost all production is from the Santa Barbara Channel and the
Santa Maria Basin.
   In a meeting with reporters, Bettenberg said the Interior
Department expects new proposals in about four weeks from other
parties in negotiations attempting to resolve a 9-year-old lawsuit
by the state of California challenging the adequacy of air
pollution regulations for offshore rigs.
   Those negotiations, now almost two years old, involve industry,
environmental groups and others.
   Bettenberg said the federal government proposed a new set of
regulations in June to its negotiating partners and warned that it
would adopt them if there were no agreement.
   He said the others put up a counterproposal, ``one we thought
there was a serious possibility'' the government could accept, but
last week groups that ``had not been terribly active in the
negotiations indicated they had some problems with it,'' and the
government agreed to grant four weeks for another counterproposal.
   ``In June, I thought chances for an agreement were slim. In
July, they looked really great. They don't look quite so good
now,'' Bettenberg said.
   He declined to give specifics because all parties have agreed to
keep their proposals secret until the talks are over.

   President Maung Maung on Thursday refused
to bow to massive protests demanding an interim government, but he
said his government would proceed with plans that could end 26
years of one-party rule.
   Tens of thousands of people staged pro-democracy demonstrations
in the capital, but a mass rally called by striking government
employees fizzled. A strike by airport workers grounded all
international flights.
   Maung Maung, Burma's first civilian president since 1962, said
in a speech on state-run radio and television that he called an
emergency meeting of the ruling party for Sept. 12 to consider a
referendum on ending single-party rule. An emergency Parliament
session is scheduled for the next day in a process the government
says could lead to a multiparty general election.
   ``There is no constitutional provision to form the (interim)
government,'' said Maung Maung, speaking slowly and calmly without
visible emotion.
   ``The government will proceed with the constitutional process of
holding the referendum, after obtaining the approval of the ...
Burma Socialist Program Party and the emergency Parliament.
   ``We cannot violate these fundamental provisions,'' he said.
``We cannot hand over to the future generation an inheritance of
the example of easily breaking discipline,'' he said.
   In a conciliatory gesture to protest leaders, Maung Maung said
the government will permit student unions and will rebuild the
Rangoon University student union building. The military blew up the
building in July 1962 while suppressing student dissent after Gen.
Ne Win led the coup that ended democracy in Burma.
   Students met on the campus Sunday to form a union, one of
several illegal associations recently announced in defiance of the
Constitution.
   Maung Maung urged government employees who have been staging
crippling pro-democracy strikes to return to work. He asked the
army, Buddhist monks and other religious leader to help the
government ease the crisis.
   Union Burma Airways suspended domestic and international service
on Aug. 26, but until Thursday flights by other carriers continued
from Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand. Union Burma Airways also
managed a flight to Bangkok, Thailand, and back on Wednesday.
   Employees of more than 120 government departments and
state-owned corporations who formed a general strike committee this
week called for 1 million people to rally Thursday at Bandoola
Gardens, Rangoon's largest park.
   Tens of thousands of people rallied in the streets Thursday, and
several thousand striking government employees and students
gathered outside the park. The gates to the park were shut, but not
locked, and the obviously poorly organized crowd made no attempt to
enter.
   An hour later, all but a few hundred demonstrators had
peacefully dispersed. Small rallies outside the nearby U.S. Embassy
and near a government building also broke up.
   The government said Wednesday it would take action against
demonstrators who illegally occupied government buildings and
facilities. Protesters in several towns have taken over and
sometimes destroyed government and party offices.
   Government troops, who have watched from afar since five days of
bloody riots forced hard-line President Sein Lwin to resign Aug.
12, took over local government offices Wednesday in the Bahan and
Sanchaung areas of the capital and began repairing them.
   Members of former strongman Ne Win's entourage went Wednesday to
the Foreign Trade Bank and tried to transfer $3 million to a bank
in London, a senior bank official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said junior
bank employees heard about the request and demanded that the bank
refuse because Ne Win no long has authority to order such transfers.
   As word of the transfer request spread, a crowd gathered around
the bank and senior bank officials eventually rejected it, the
official said. He declined to identify the people who sought the
transfer or the bank in London.
   Ne Win resigned July 23, taking indirect responsibility for
bloody, student-led riots in March and June. He called for a
referendum on single-party rule, but the party rejected this and
picked Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   Nationwide anti-government demonstrations followed, and troops
fired on unarmed crowds. By official count, 112 people were killed
in Rangoon alone before Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12. Peaceful
pro-democracy demonstrations have continued.

   Israel and Jordan have been the big
losers in the nearly nine-month Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories, an Israeli research group says.
   The annual Middle East Balance of Forces report published this
week by Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies
concluded Israel's use of force alone has been unable to restore
order in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Retired Brig. Gen. Aryeh Shalev, a former head of Israel's
military government in the West Bank, wrote that the Israeli army
had been weakened by the confrontation.
   ``Israel lost much of its deterrent image with respect to the
Arab residents,'' he said. ``The use of riot batons instilled fear
into the local residents but did not restore the army's
deterrence.''
   Additional measures did not suppress the violence ``because of
the readiness of many Palestinian youths and young adults to
persist in the confrontation and pay the price,'' Shalev said.
   Speaking on Israel radio, Shalev said Jordan's influence
disappeared as the uprising grew. But he said so far the Palestine
Liberation Organization had failed to transform its success in the
streets into a peace process.
   ``The PLO can lose a potential political achievement. The PLO is
now facing the problem of changing its strategy in order to become
an acceptable partner to the Israelis and maybe before that to the
United States,'' he said.
   In July, King Hussein announced that Jordan was severing ties
with the West Bank, which Israel seized along with the Gaza Strip
in 1967.
   The Jaffee Center study also says that the risk of war with
Syria had lessened because the Damascus regime faced severe
economic difficulties, lacked allies and experienced increased
friction with the Soviet Union, its main arms supplier.
   The analysis contrasts with frequent warnings from Israeli
officials and military commanders, who stress the threat of
conflict with Syria.
   The 498-page report says Syria's total armed forces has declined
from 840,000 in 1986 to 730,000 last year. This was mainly because
President Hafez Assad trimmed his defense budget by about $100
million, or 3 percent.
   ``Due to extreme economic difficulties, Syria was forced to
mothball a couple of divisions and remains without allies. It also
increasingly appears to be encountering differences of opinions
with the Soviets,'' Joseph Alpher, executive editor of the study,
said in an interview.
   Retired Brig. Gen. Aharon Levran, a former intelligence officer,
wrote in the report that the belt-tightening ``genuinely weakened''
Syria's armed forces by reducing training time and cutting back on
fuel and food for the troops.
   Alpher predicted the end of the Iran-Iraq war will likely
increase the traditional rivalry between Baghdad and Damascus. That
and the unresolved conflict in Lebanon could preoccupy Syria.
   He said Syria has warehoused hundreds of tanks and turned
regular army units into reserve forces.
   ``If a state plans to go to war in the next six months or a
year, it usually doesn't do things like that,'' said Levran, who
also commanded armor and infantry units before retiring in 1984.
   The Jaffee Center experts said that in any future war Israel
would be more vulnerable to attacks aimed at population centers or
locations where reserve units are mobilized.
   They said Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia had developed
intermediate range ballistic missiles, chemical warheads and longer
range air power.
   ``I see a very reasonable possibility that they will be used on
military targets in a possible future war and maybe even the home
front,'' said Shalev.

   A Foreign Ministry official said
Thursday the government doesn't want a group of Americans to
distribute a $2.4 million reward for the return of missing U.S.
servicemen because it might offend Thailand's communist neighbors.
   The group said it was sponsoring seven Vietnam War veterans and
relatives of servicemen missing in Indochina who plan to travel to
Thailand in October and float on the Mekong River Vietnamese
currency notes stamped with the reward offer.
   ``The government of Thailand is attempting to roadblock'' the
effort, the National Steering Committee for American War Veterans
said in a telex this week to The Associated Press bureau in Bangkok.
   The money was pledged by former North Carolina Rep. Bill Hendon,
former Vietnam War prisoner Eugene McDaniel and 21 Republican
congressmen.
   The ministry official said the plan might be seen as a hostile
act by Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and harm Thailand's efforts to
improve relations with those neighbors.
   The group said Ted Sampley, committee chairman and Vietnam War
veteran, met Aug. 26 with officials of the Thai Embassy in
Washington and was told: ``We have received word from Bangkok that
you are not to do this. If you violate our laws, you know what we
must do.''
   The embassy officials refused to say what laws would be
violated, the telex said. ``We have no intention of violating any
Thai law, but if they are trying to short-circuit our plans because
of some political policy, they are going to have a problem,'' the
telex quoted Sampley as saying.
   The Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he had not received any formal notice of the
group's plans.
   Vietnam's official Communist Party newspaper on Aug. 3 denounced
the reward offer, and the Thai official noted that Laos strongly
objected when relatives of servicemen missing in action, or MIAs,
floated similar offers on the Mekong last year. Both countries have
angrily denied holding American prisoners.
   The new government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choohavan has put
priority on improving relations with Indochina. Relations have been
sour since the communist victories in all three countries in 1975
and especially since 1979, when Vietnam invaded and occupied
Cambodia.

   Daryl Hall feels so strongly about
keeping a dump out of his town he's donating the proceeds from a

   Hall owns a farm in Washington, N.Y., a proposed site for the
dump.
   Ellen Zoe Golden, a publicist for the duo, said Hall attended
several town meetings on the dump.
   The town is one of five possible sites for a landfill, according
to Joanne Grimes, a spokeswoman for the Dutchess County Resource
Recovery Council. The landfill would hold ash and other residue
from the county's resource recovery plant, she said.
   ``I am totally opposed to the proposed siting. The whole concept

   Ryman, who plays for tourists in a Nashville restaurant, and a
dozen backup singers and musicians leave Saturday for a recording

   Ryman caught the eye of Melodyia officials in January when he
performed at a music industry convention in Cannes, France. He
signed a Melodyian contract in July.
   On the album, he will sing Elvis Presley's ``She's Not You,''
Marty Robbins' ``Singin' the Blues,'' Fats Domino's ``I'm

   American rock star Prince needs a new place to play
in Rome.
   The Italian Culture Ministry on Thursday refused permission for
Prince to use Rome's Stadio Dei Marmi _ Marble Stadium _ for his
scheduled concert next Monday. It also won't allow a Sept. 12
concert by the group Deep Purple.
   Culture Minister Vincenza Bono Parrino said the 20,000-seat
stadium and national monument is in ``a fairly advanced state of
decay'' and should not be further threatened by the staging of a
rock concert.
   The stadium, adorned with 60 colossal statues of athletes, is
part of the Foro Italico complex, a sports center built under the
Fascist regime in the 1930s.
   Thousands of tickets, priced at $28 and $39, had already been
sold for Monday's concert.
   Prince, who is on a European-wide ``Lovesexy'' tour, has refused
to perform at other Rome stadiums in the past. There was no
immediate word on whether Monday's concert would be re-scheduled.

   Sir John Tooley, the longtime boss of the Royal
Opera House, has retired.
   Tooley was general director for the last 18 years. The opera
house has had only two chiefs since World War II.
   Despite barbs from some London critics, Tooley, 64, said in an
interview before leaving: ``I've had the best job in the world.''
   With 1,000 staff and performers, The Royal Opera House costs $51
million a year to run. Its government subsidy last year was $21
million.
   Critics say it spends too much on badly conceived productions
and that taxpayers shouldn't subsidize wealthy opera-goers.
   Tooley said: ``Forty years ago we had no opera and precious
little ballet because there were no permanent companies. Now, with
our opera and ballet companies ... our productivity is colossal
compared with other European houses, and it's done on significantly
less money.''
   The new director will be Jeremy Isaacs, who ran commercial
television's Channel 4 network.

<HEAD>At Last, `BBC World Service' Calling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said Thursday it is
adopting a new title by which it is already known to millions of
its overseas listeners: the BBC World Service.
   Out goes BBC External Services, a name that managing director
John Tusa says has increasingly ``sat in a clumsy and uncomfortable
way on our shoulders.''
   It is the fourth time the BBC has changed the name of its
broadcasts that reach an estimated 120 million people around the
world.
   ``As far as everyone else is concerned, we have always been the
BBC World Service,'' Tusa said. ``So we have decided to adopt that
title. It is familiar, intelligible, universal and clearly reflects
our global role.''
   The term World Service long has applied to the BBC's 24-hour
broadcasts in English, but not to the 36 foreign language services
it transmits.
   The BBC first began international broadcasts in 1932 under the
banner BBC Empire Service. That was changed to BBC Overseas
Services in 1938 when foreign language transmissions were added. By
1952, BBC External Services was the in-vogue phrase meant to
embrace all overseas output, English included.
   ``We have now recognized we were wrong about External Services
and everyone else was right,'' Tusa said.

at a ``town meeting'' on campus Sept. 14.
   The next day, Carter will begin classroom lectures. He normally
visits the private school each month for two or three days,
lecturing to about six classes, said an aide, Steven Hochman.
   As a ``university distinguished professor,'' Carter addresses
classes from all areas of the college and sometimes visits other
institutions on Emory's behalf, Hochman said.
   The seventh annual town meeting is open only to Emory faculty,
staff and students because of space limitations, Hochman said.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas launched rockets at
Kabul and its airport Thursday and Afghan fighters struck deep into
Pakistani territory in one of the most violent days of
Afghanistan's 10-year-old civil war.
   Western diplomats, quoting dispatches from missions in the
Afghan capital, said the airport was shrouded in ``thick black and
gray smoke'' from the rocket attack.
   Earlier in the day, Pakistani authorities said seven Afghan
fighter-bombers struck the deepest to date into Pakistani
territory, killing one person and injuring seven.
   Diplomatic dispatches from Kabul said the rockets started
hitting the city around 2:55 p.m. at Kabul airport and
``significant parts of the city.''
   ``By 3:20 the fire was out of control,'' said a dispatch from
one western embassy. ``There were secondary explosions and
foreigners were ordered to evacuate (the airport),'' it said.
   ``Rockets have been exploding in Kabul all afternoon,'' said a
U.S. diplomat on condition of anonymity. ``The force of the
explosion indicates it may have been an ammunition dump,'' he said.
   In a report from Kabul, the official Soviet news agency Tass
said ``opposition units today subjected to massive bombardment with
ground-to-ground rockets the Kabul international airport area. The
rockets damaged depots and transport aircraft.''
   The report added that several rockets exploded in residential
districts of Kabul, and authorities had put out the resulting fires.
   Reports said it was not clear how many rockets had fallen. There
were no immediate reports of casualties and state-run Kabul radio,
in its nighttime broadcast, made no mention of the attack.
   Both the Kabul attack and the bombing of villages near the
Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar appeared more daring and
destructive than any operations this year. Afghan insurgents began
fighting communist Afghan forces in 1978.
   Pakistani sources reported Thursday that seven Soviet-built
Afghan fighter-bombers hit villages 30 miles east of the Afghan
border.
   Kabul radio said four people, including children, were killed
and nine others were wounded. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said one
person was killed and seven injured, and five houses were destroyed.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
condemned the bombing as the ``latest and most extreme incident of
armed intervention'' against Pakistan's territorial integrity, and
said it violated the 4-month-old Geneva accords.
   ``The United States condemns this act of aggression against
Pakistan,'' Ms. Oakley said, adding that U.S. figures had one
person killed and 18 wounded.
   Ms. Oakley said it was not clear whether the planes were flown
by Soviets or Afghans. She said the United States would raise the
issue with the United Nations and with Soviet authorities.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasir Jamal said the attack may have
been the worst violation of Pakistan's territory since
Afghanistan's civil war broke out 10 years ago.
   Government officials originally said five planes conducted the
raid but later claimed there were seven.
   Nasir said the planes flew 43 miles into the Warsak district of
northwest Pakistan, killing one person, injuring seven and
destroying five houses.
   ``According to my knowledge, it was the deepest violation of our
territory (so far in the war),'' Nasir said.
   Cross-border shellings and bombings are frequent in the tribal
areas of Pakistan's frontier, where the U.S.-backed guerrillas
stage their attacks.
   The raid was the first on what Pakistanis call a ``settled
area,'' dotted with villages and under full provincial control.
   Omar Amir, a Pakistani journalist who visited the site, said
villagers believed the intruding aircraft were Soviet-built MiG
bombers.
   Omar said 12 people were injured, all Pakistanis.
   Moscow and Kabul repeatedly have accused Pakistan of violating
an accord providing for the withdrawal from Afghanistan of Soviet
troops who entered in 1979 to back the government troops.
   Afghan President Najib on Wednesday proposed a meeting between
the foreign ministers of Pakistan, the United States, the Soviet
Union and Afghanistan to discuss implementation of the accord,
signed April 14 in Geneva.
   Tass quoted Najib as saying Thursday that since May, when the
Soviets began withdrawing their troops, ``the armed opposition has
been imposing war on us and we, regrettably, are being drawn into
it even more actively.''
   ``If war is being imposed on us, we, in turn, should impose the
policy of reconciliation,'' he told a meeting of leaders of
Afghanistan's political parties. ``Above all, it is necessary to
press for the cease-fire not only in the country as a whole, but
also in individual villages, districts and provinces.''

   Authorities have begun making arrests and
seizing equipment in a crackdown on video pirates who peddle
satellite devices used for free viewing of pay TV programs, the
Federal Communications Commission said Thursday.
   FCC official Richard Smith estimated that nearly half of the one
million satellite dishes used to receive pay TV programs have
illegal devices that unscramble the picture, and let the viewer
watch for free.
   Smith, chief of the field operations bureau, said the FCC and
the Justice Department have decided to target manufacturers and
distributors of the equipment rather than individual users.
   But he cautioned home viewers with the devices that they are
acting illegally and subject to criminal and civil penalties if
caught.
   The illegal devices are clones of authorized computer chips
which unscramble the television picture beamed to satellite dish
antennas.
   ``If unchecked,'' said FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick, the
growth of the illegal chips threaten ``the viability of the
satellite-to-home program market.''
   Patrick has said the devices not only steal from those who
created the programming, but from viewers who pay for the service
and may lose it if the problem is not brought under control.
   Criminal penalties for those convicted of distributing or
selling the equipment face up to $500,000 in fines and five years
in prison. Individuals convicted of using the devices could be
sentenced to a maximum $100,000 fine and up to a year's
imprisonment.
   Smith said that John R. Ross Jr., of Cartersville, Ga. was
arrested last week on charges of marketing unauthorized satellite
descrambling equipment.
   In Ocala, Fla. a firm, V.C. Bytes, was charged with selling the
devices, he said.
   Descrambling equipment was seized from Satellite Television
Center in Palestine, Texas, and from United Satellite of America,
in Las Vegas, Nev., although no charges have been filed in either
case.

<TEXT>
   The debate over presidential debates remained
unresolved Thursday as campaign managers for Democrat Michael
Dukakis and Republican George Bush failed to agree on how many
face-to-face encounters the candidates should have.
   Neither side has budged from positions taken earlier this week
when Bush campaign manager James A. Baker III offered two televised
presidential debates and Dukakis manager Paul Brountas held out for
three.
   However, the Bush campaign appeared to nudge the schedule back
by a few days and pushed for an open format as opposed to sticking
to specific topics.
   Unlike the earlier meeting, which was conducted in person in
Washington, Thursday's negotiating session was on the telephone.
The two sides did agree to talk to each other again on the phone on
Tuesday.
   In statements issued after the phone call, both sides said time
was running short, with the election just two months away and
television schedules already crowded with the major league baseball
playoffs and the Olympics.
   ``The American people should have an opportunity to view the
presidential candidates discussing the important issues concerning
America's future in full,'' Brountas said. ``They should not have
to choose between watching the nominees debate world events and
watching the World Series.''
   Baker said Vice President Bush is willing to debate Dukakis any
time between Sept. 25 and Oct. 17. On Tuesday, Baker said that the
first debate could be held as early as Sept. 22.
   ``Our campaign hopes to resolve a debate schedule soon,'' Baker
said in his statement Thursday. ``Our schedule cannot be kept open
for this full 23 days forever, and we hope the Democratic campaign
will see fit to come to an agreement on a debate schedule as soon
as possible.''
   The Dukakis campaign wanted the first debate to be on foreign
policy and national security issues, but that was rejected by the
Bush campaign on Tuesday. After the Thursday session, Baker said
the debates should be on the ``broad range of issues being
discussed in the campaign rather than being subject specific.''
   The two campaigns have agreed that the vice presidential running
mates, Republican Dan Quayle and Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, would meet
for one televised debate.

   A bus swerved to avoid bricks
tumbling off an oncoming truck and plunged into a reservoir,
killing 31 people, officials said Thursday.
   The bus, which crashed Wednesday night about 150 miles west of
Belgrade, was hoisted from the water Thursday with three bodies
still inside.
   The state news agency Tanjug quoted officials at the scene as
saying they believed they accounted for all the passengers, but
divers continued to search the muddy bottom of the reservoir.
   Tanjug said 14 people survived the 50-yard plunge off a cliff
into the water and were hospitalized.
   Most of the passengers were workers from the Branko Krsmanovic
knitwear factory in Paracin, about 75 miles southeast of Belgrade,
and their families on their way home from a vacation at the
Adriatic resort of Gradac.
   Tanjug said at least eight children were among the dead.
   Yugoslav television said the driver of the truck left the scene
of the accident and that police detained him about 1 a.m. in a
nearby town. He was identified as Mirsad Muminivic.
   The bus plunged into the reservoir that supplies the Gabrovica
hydroelectric power plant about 9 p.m. Wednesday.
   ``I was asleep when I felt a terrible crash and fell between the
seats,'' said Zoran Dencic, one of the survivors. ``I saw light and
managed to swim to the surface.''
   Another passenger, Svetlana Mosovski, said she also was sleeping
when the bus crashed into the water.
   ``I do not remember how I swam to the surface,'' she said. She
said she sat on one of the bus' tires, but then the bus began to
sink. ``I do not recall who brought me to shore.''
   The water was 60 feet deep where the bus fell, and divers said
it was cold and the visibility poor, complicating rescue
operations. The level of the reservoir was reduced by 15 feet to
aid rescue operations, Tanjug said.
   The road was closed briefly while cranes lifted the bus from the
water, Yugoslav media said.
   The Paracin factory said it would grant the families of dead
workers $66, Belgrade radio reported.

   The Navy's top admiral has upheld disciplinary
action against a senior officer found guilty of improprieties
involving travel, forcing him to retire at lower rank, the service
said Thursday.
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, the chief of naval operations,
``reviewed the case of Vice Adm. Kendall E. Moranville and approved
the results of the flag mast (disciplinary hearing) ...,'' the Navy
said in a statement released in response to a reporter's query.
   ``Under these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to
nominate Vice Adm. Moranville for retirement in his present grade
and therefore retirement was approved at the permanent grade of
rear admiral, effective Oct. 1, 1988.''
   The Navy said Trost had conducted his review on Wednesday,
studying an appeal filed by Moranville after he was disciplined
with a punitive letter of reprimand last month.
   In rejecting the appeal, Trost decided that Moranville would
have to retire with the permanent two-star rank of rear admiral
rather than the three-star rank he has held since June 1, 1985, the
Navy said.
   While there is almost no difference in pension between the two
ranks for an officer with Moranville's tenure, Trost's action
amounts to a permanent blemish for an officer of such high rank.
   The Navy, which previously had declined comment on details of
the case, disclosed Thursday that Moranville had been disciplined
``for improprieties involving travel claims and the use of
government aircraft.''
   Pentagon sources who demanded anonymity said the charges
involved arrangements made by Moranville on behalf of a woman
employed by the United Service Organizations while he was commander
of the Navy's 6th Fleet in Naples, Italy.
   Moranville, 56, stepped down from that post on Aug. 20 in a
routine rotation and had been expected to assume a new post at the
Pentagon until word of the disciplinary action surfaced.
   Late last week, the Navy acknowledged Moranville ``was taken to
admiral's mast ... on Aug. 19, 1988'' before Adm. James B. Busey,
the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe, and disciplined with a
letter of reprimand.
   After receiving the letter, Moranville appealed the decision to
Trost but also filed a request for retirement, the Navy said.
   An admiral's mast is a closed-door, non-judicial proceeding
during which an admiral reviews the evidence on his own and decides
if any discipline is warranted.
   Moranville, a veteran combat pilot who fought in Vietnam, had
been widely rumored as the next deputy chief of naval operations
for naval warfare.

   Parker Bros. has asked that a Republican
group stop using the ``Get Out of Jail Free'' card from its
copyrighted Monopoly game as part of a campaign that takes a swipe
at Michael Dukakis and a Massachusetts prison furlough program.
   Patricia McGovern, a spokeswoman for Parker Bros., said the
College Republican National Committee did not seek the game-maker's
permission to use a replica of the Monopoly card.
   ``Under no circumstances would he have allowed this,'' she told
The Boston Herald on Wednesday. ``We will immediately send them a
letter ordering them to cease and desist the copyright
infringement.''
   The Washington-based committee said it has handed out 100,000 of
the cards and planned to issue another 100,000. The card is
virtually identical to the ``Get Out of Jail Free'' card included
in the popular board game but has the added note: ``Compliments of
Michael Dukakis.''
   Susan Brackin, executive director of the Republican
organization, said the group did not seek permission from Parker
Bros. to use the card because ``we're not selling them. We're just
using them as parody.''

<HEAD>Mediator In Iran-Iran Talks Has Extensive Experience</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jan Eliasson, appointed Thursday as the U.N.
chief's special representative in the Iran-Iraq talks, is a Swedish
career diplomat with extensive experience in dealing with the war
as a formal U.N. mediator.
   Eliasson, 47, has been Sweden's ambassador to the United Nations
in New York since March.
   From 1980 to 1986, he was a special aide on Iran and Iraq to
former Prime Minister Olof Palme and traveled to the region a dozen
times.
   Palme was appointed special U.N. mediator in the Iran-Iraq war
by then-Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim in November 1980, just
after the conflict broke out. He was assassinated in Stockholm on
Feb. 28, 1986.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, announcing Eliasson's
appointment, praised the diplomat as an experienced negotiator and
U.N. delegate who was ``the right hand of Mr. Palme'' in the prime
minister's ``remarkable efforts'' to end the Persian Gulf war.
   ``I therefore think it is to the benefit of our common cause
that I have now Mr. Eliasson as my special representative,'' he
said. ``We are going to work together very closely. He has my full
confidence and I am sure he will follow the same tactics I have.''
   Eliasson told reporters he was ``very gratified to be asked by
the secretary-general to perform this important function,'' which
he described as ``a difficult one.''
   He said he was grateful that the United Nations had the
confidence of Iran and Iraq, ``which is necessary in this conflict
which goes so deep.''
   ``The gulf distrust has been very wide (and) we hope it will be
becoming a little bit smaller,'' he said. ``I hope very much in
this work to have the strong support of the parties and the
continued confidence of the parties.'' Eliasson was born in
Goteborg, Sweden, on Sept. 17, 1940, and entered the foreign
service in 1965. Aside from numerous foreign policy posts in
Stockholm, including department head for Asian and African affairs,
he has served in the Swedish embassies in Bonn and Washington.
   Eliasson is married and has two daughters and a son.

   Speculation centered on engine trouble,
indicated in cockpit conversations, as investigators and
manufacturers' representatives today tried to determine the cause
of a Delta Air Lines jetliner crash that killed 13 people.
   Nearly 100 people, many leaping through thick smoke and blazing
jet fuel, survived the crash of the Boeing 727 that broke open and
burned during takeoff Wednesday morning at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   The recording of cockpit conversations, reviewed in Washington,
indicated an engine problem, Lee Dickinson, a spokesman for the
National Transportation Safety Board, said today.
   ``Shortly after takeoff there was a sound,'' he said. It was
apparently a ``warning a stall condition may be approaching,''
Dickinson said. ``Shortly after that, there was some conversation
about an engine problem.''
   The information was obtained after safety board officials
listened to the cockpit tape recording once and they will listen to
it again, he said.
   The same flight today taxied out for takeoff but then turned
back to the terminal, Delta officials said from Atlanta.
   On Wednesday, survivors, many suffering burns, crawled or jumped
through gaping holes in the fuselage and clambered over red-hot
wings to safety as black smoke billowed three stories high,
witnesses said.
   ``You heard the thing crumple, so you knew you were going to
crash the whole time,'' said passenger Penn Waugh, a lawyer from
Dallas. ``You were just looking for a way to get out of the plane.
You're hoping you weren't going to die.''
   Ninety-seven passengers and a crew of seven were listed aboard
the aircraft, Flight 1141 en route to Salt Lake City, but the exact
count was uncertain because babies were not included on passenger
lists. The flight originated in Jackson, Miss.
   Nearly two dozen investigators from the NTSB converged on the
crash site. Spokesmen for Boeing and for Pratt & Whitney,
manufacturer of the plane's three engines, said they would also
send investigators.
   Witnesses said there appeared to have been a fire or explosion
in an engine on takeoff, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
Jack Barker said today. ``But that was not confirmed. This was
merely what some witnesses were reporting.''
   A Delta official said there had been an apparent engine problem,
and a passenger on another plane said he saw flames from the right
engine.
   NTSB investigator Warren Wandel said the aircraft flight data
recorder and cockpit voice recorder, the so-called ``black boxes,''
were found in good shape. They were sent to Washington for
examination.
   Delta released names of 95 survivors, while hospitals who
treated victims counted at least 96 people, many suffering from
burns, smoke inhalation and broken bones. Some walked away
unscathed and flew to their destinations.
   Thirteen fatalities were confirmed, including an infant and two
flight attendants, said Bill Berry, Delta spokesman in Atlanta. All
were from Texas, the airline said.
   Sixty-one people were treated and released from seven hospitals,
officials said.
   Survivors said the 15-year-old jet appeared to lose power after
leaving the ground in hazy sunshine, bouncing three times before it
slid along the ground and broke into pieces about 1,000 feet beyond
the end of the runway, spurting flames.
   The plane, its hull burned and tail-section broken, came to rest
in a grassy field dotted by sunflowers. One of the three engines
lay several hundred yards away.
   ``Apparently the pilot made an attempt to abort. ... There
apparently was an engine problem,'' said Fred H. Rollins, Delta's
district manager for marketing in Salt Lake City.
   Rick Arnett, an Austin attorney who was on a plane that had just
landed, said he saw flames from an engine.
   ``As the plane came up to take off, it was barely getting off
the ground and the right wing was dipping as it passed beyond us.
There were flames coming out of the right engine and the wing
touched the ground. The plane started spinning (and) there was an
explosion,'' he said.
   However, Delta officials in Dallas would not confirm speculation
about the engine, and Dickinson said: ``We will not rule out
anything. All doors are open.''
   Federal Aviation Administration records show the cockpit crew
had clean flying records, and the plane reported only minor
problems during the past five years, including replacement of a
wing flap controller.
   Delta spokesman Henry Conley said none of the airline's other
727s would be pulled from service because of the crash. ``We don't
see anything serious enough to pull any planes,'' he said.
   Among the survivors were the three pilots, officials said,
including Capt. Larry Davis, 48, of Greenville, a Delta pilot since
1965 and a Boeing 727 captain for the last nine years.
   Parkland Hospital officials said Davis, who was pinned in the
wreckage, was talking but in shock. His injuries were described as
traumatic.
   Mary Cintron, a toll booth cashier at the airport who saw the
accident, said she was astonished at how many people survived,
particularly since she witnessed the worst aviation disaster in
Texas history, the Aug. 2, 1985, crash of another Delta flight that
attempted to land at the airport during a thunderstorm, killing 137
people.
   ``Today looked 200 times worse,'' she said. ``I didn't think
anybody had made it.''
   Most of the fatalities occurred in the back of the plane,
authorities said.
   Cpl. Jim Hartman of the Dallas-Fort Worth Department of Public
Safety said ``it was incredible'' that so many survived.
   One passenger, Mona Thomason, said she and others ``jumped on
the wing but it looked like we were jumping into a pit of fire.''
She reported seeing a woman with two children _ ``she got one of
them out, but I'm afraid the other one was caught in the fire.''
   ``People were jumping on the plane's wing and burning themselves
on it because it was so red hot,'' said passenger Jim Hammock. ``We
got out of the way fast because we thought it was going to
explode.''
   Andy Dyer, 38, a firefighter on his way to Montana to help
battle forest fires, said the other passengers were orderly as they
left the plane.
   ``It was kind of surprising. ... There wasn't any screaming
hardly at all. It was real quiet. I think everybody was aware of
what was going on,'' said Dyer, who was treated for second-degree
burns on his arms and hands.
   The jetliner was dark after the crash, said David Carmichael,
38, who headed toward a source of light _ a hole in the torn
fuselage.
   ``I waited in line to crawl out through that hole. It was the
nearest light that I could see coming into the plane other than the
fire down the right side. You could feel the heat and the smoke was
terrible,'' Carmichael said.
   Seattle-based Boeing Co. said the aircraft was purchased new by
Delta in 1973, and officials said new engines _ Pratt & Whitney
JT8Ds _ were installed five years ago. Spokesman David Jimenez said
the jet had accumulated 38,629 takeoffs and landings, a number he
described as average.
   The 727 has been a workhorse for many of the world's airlines
for nearly 25 years. The aircraft, which was discontinued in 1984,
remains the most widely used jet in the United States, making up
nearly one-third of the U.S. fleet of 3,476 passenger and cargo
aircraft.

   The presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis has
cautioned supporters against donating money to Citizens for
Dukakis, an Illinois-based political action committee which has
been conducting a telephone fund-raising effort.
   Daniel Small, general counsel for Dukakis' finance operation,
said the organization is not authorized by the Dukakis campaign or
the Democratic National Committee.
   Small said the campaign has receieved numerous complaints from
people who were solicited by callers for Citizens for Dukakis and
thought they were donating money to the Dukakis campaign.
   ``We have no idea how they spend their money, and we would urge
anyone who wishes to help Mike Dukakis or any Democratic candidate
to contribute their money to the DNC,'' Small said.
   Janet Kelsey, executive director of Citizens for Dukakis,
acknowledged that her organization, which she described as an
independant political action committee, has no connection with the
Dukakis campaign.
   ``We have reviewed this with our telemarketers, and we've put in
some new language'' that makes it clear Citizens for Dukakis is not
connected with the campaign or the DNC, Kelsey said. ``We never
intended to imply a connection.''

   Police officers are hitting the beach
... to fill their ranks, not their jail.
   Officers from Coventry traveled 25 miles to Scarborough State
Beach on the Rhode Island Sound, opened a card table, hung a banner
and sat down to wait for recruits, Chief Bruce Germani said.
   Germani said he hoped to attract college graduates who spent the
summer relaxing and are now seriously looking for jobs.
   ``When unemployment is high, this is a very attractive job,''
Germani said Wednesday. ``But in a good economy, like we have now,
the job market is highly competitive.''
   There is no lack of applicants, but finding good people is
difficult, Germani said. The police department has 48 officers.
   Officer Dave Beaudry, the department's community relations
officer, said the department will get about 300 applications but
will send only one or two people to a training academy this month.
   Germani said he will visit area colleges and shopping malls next
month. ``By that time, people will be shopping for winter clothes
and the students will have gotten settled in their classes,'' he
said.

   Dogs lead the pack when it comes to biting
people. But people are putting the bite on other people as well.
   Dogs bit people 8,064 times last year in New York City; people
bit people 1,587 times. That pecking order has remained the same
for the past nine years, the city Health Department said Thursday
in its annual bulletin of reported bite cases.
   Next in frequency were bites from cats, 802, and rats, 291, the
department said. The total of bites from all sources was 11,065,
compared to 12,121 in 1986.
   Except for humans themselves, people-biters have been striking
less often every year for the past decade. The dog bite total was
down by 10 percent last year. The people-bite figure increased
slightly, from 1,572 in 1986.
   Other biters of people in 1987 included 95 squirrels, 72
hamsters, 34 gerbils, 18 snakes and 15 rabbits. Also, raccoons, 11;
bees and lab mice, 10 each; monkeys, ferrets and horses, 7 each;
parrots and fish, 5 each; bats and turtles, 4 each; guinea pigs,
skunks and spiders, 3 each; weasels, iguanas and roosters, 2 each;
and a penguin and an otter, 1 each.
   Missing from the 1987 list were a goat, ocelot and muskrat, each
of which made the 1986 list.

<HEAD>Justice Department Charges Philadelphia In Pollution Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Thursday charged the
city of Philadelphia with violating the Clean Water Act by dumping
excessive amounts of pollutants and sludge into the Delaware River.
   The department's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia, represents the fourth civil action brought against
the city in the past 10 years for alleged violations at its three
sewage treatment plants. Assistant Attorney General Roger J.
Marzulla noted the city has received $575 million in federal grants
over the years to upgrade the system.
   The latest suit charges ``numerous'' violations at the city's
Southwest sewage treatment plant, some of which, it says, began in
1984 and have continued since. The purported unlawful discharges
include several oxygen-depleting pollutants, suspended solids,
fecal coliform and the heavy metals copper and cadmium.
   In addition, the department charged that the city's water
treatment plants illegally discharged sludge that interfered with
the operations of the sewage plant, or passed through it.
   In four counts, the complaint asked the court to impose a civil
penalty of up to $10,000 for each day of each violation occurring
before Feb. 4, 1987, and a penalty of up to $25,000 daily for each
violation since. Although it did not specify the number of alleged
violations, leaving that for future proceedings, the total
potential fine conceivably could range in the millions of dollars.
   The city also was charged with failure to provide the
Environmental Protection Agency with pollutant sampling
information, and sought a penalty of $25,000 for each day of each
violation on or after Feb. 4, 1987.
   Marzulla noted the action was the latest in a series of
complaints brought under EPA policies requiring municipalities to
comply with the Clean Water Act. Earlier lawsuits were filed
against San Diego, Calif., Boston, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Denver,
and Minneapolis.
   ``The Justice Department and EPA are determined that all
municipalities in the nation meet the act's requirements,''
Marzulla said. ``We will continue to bring enforcement actions
until there is full compliance.'' The EPA recently estimated that
87 percent of the publicly owned water and sewage plants around the
nation are in compliance.
   The department's earlier complaints against Philadelphia
included a 1978 suit that charged construction, reporting and
pollution violations at the three sewage plants. It was resolved by
a consent decree requiring rehabilitation work at the plants.
   In 1982, the government alleged that the city failed to meet
construction deadlines and pollution limitations at the Southwest
plant. Again, the city agreed to resolve the problems and paid a
$40,000 penalty into a trust fund to finance other environmental
projects.
   In 1986, the city was sued again, this time over construction
and pollution problems at its Northeast plant. The city accepted
revised construction schedules, agreed to carry out $2.3 million
worth of other environmental projects and paid an additional
$240,000 into the trust fund for future projects.

<TEXT>
   Fistfights broke out between members of
rival parties in Parliament on Thursday, and the upper and lower
houses had to adjourn twice because legislative leaders couldn't
stop the melees.
   It was the first time legislators came to blows in the normally
sedate Parliament, the reports said.
   Opposition party members were upset after police wielding batons
and throwing tear gas charged a group of legislators outside Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's residence earlier in the day. Nine
policemen and seven legislators suffered minor injuries and 162
legislators were arrested on charges of rioting.
   Opposition parties issued a strong protest with the ruling
Congress Party and then walked out of Parliament, the strongest
form of protest allowed in parliamentary procedure, the reports
said.
   The opposition members also decided to boycott the rest of the
current session of the Lok Sabha, the lower house, news agencies
said. Parliament is scheduled to recess Sept. 5.
   A doctor was called to the Lok Sabha to treat one legislator,
Telegu Desam party member C. Sambu, who was injured in a fight with
several members of the Congress Party, Press Trust of India news
agency said.
   Sambu had rushed toward Deputy Home Minister P. Chidambaram, to
snatch a statement he was reading to the house, but was stopped by
Congress Party members, news reports said.
   The trouble began early Thursday when a group of about 300
Telegu Desam Party members tried to walk to Gandhi's house to hand
him a memorandum regarding the federal government's relations with
opposition-ruled states, Chidambaram said in a statement to the Lok
Sabha.
   Police in the high-security area around the prime minister's
residence refused to allow them to enter. When the legislators
persisted, police used tear gas and batons to disperse them,
Chidambaram said.
   When Parliament met for the day, the opposition parties demanded
an apology from Gandhi, who was not present, news agencies said.
   Leaders of both houses refused the request, and chaos resulted.

<TEXT>
   The last survivor of Delta Flight 1141 reached by
rescuers was the pilot, who passengers say coaxed them out of the
burning wreckage while pinned on his back beneath debris.
   Capt. Larry Lon Davis, 48, was listed in fair condition at
Parkland Hospital on Thursday, the day after the plane crashed on
takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   The jet lost power suddenly and bounced three times before
skidding to a stop at the end of the runway and catching fire. At
least 95 people survived the crash; 13 died, including two flight
attendants.
   Many of the survivors escaped near the cockpit, which broke off
from the fuselage and rolled slightly.
   David Carmichael, a 35-year-old restaurateur from Monticello,
Ark., said he could hear Davis telling passengers to remain calm as
they scrambled to get out of the plane near him.
   ``The pilot's seat back was broken so that he was lying flat on
his back with all this debris on top,'' Carmichael said. ``And the
whole time he was saying, `Slow down; watch your step.'''
   Davis has flown for Delta since October 1965. He has flown more
than 17,000 hours commercially, with nearly 7,000 hours logged on a
B727, the type of plane he flew Wednesday.
   Firefighters found Davis strapped to his seat, slipped a
backboard underneath him and pulled him from the wreckage. He was
the last survivor to get out of the plane.
   ``He was conscious, and he was hurting,'' said Cpl. Bill Taylor,
an airport firefighter.
   Passenger Dan Walker, a Dallas veterinarian, credited the pilot
for keeping the plane level as it plummeted toward the ground.
   ``We got airborne about 300 feet and then we got in trouble and
the pilot did an excellent job of getting us flat,'' he said. ``All
he did was save a few hundred lives.''
   Neighbors in Davis' hometown of Greenville praised him as a
community leader. He is on the board of trustees for the Greenville
Christian School and is active at Aldersgate Church.
   Raiford Stainback, also a school board member, said he was not
surprised by the pilot's actions during the disaster.
   ``He's so calm. He's always got a cool head when he has to make
decisions,'' Stainback said.
   ``You don't have too many folks like Larry Davis in your
community,'' said school secretary Barbara Christian. ``We are just
so thankful that it didn't turn out as bad as it could have for
both him and the passengers.''

<HEAD>Building Stopped at Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Authorities halted construction at a nuclear power
station in Lithuania after learning it might not be safe during an
earthquake, it was reported Thursday.
   The government has spent $412 million has already been expended
on the third reactor at the Ignalinskoy nuclear power plant alone,
the government newspaper Izvestia reported. Reactors No. 1 and No.
2 have already been built.
   Although the Soviet scientific establishment repeatedly has
assured the nation that nuclear power is safe, and also necessary
for the country's economic development, the 1986 accident at the
Chernobyl power plant in the Ukraine has made many Soviets warier
of the atom.
   The Council of Ministers of the Soviet republic of Lithuania met
recently to consider ecological and safety questions raised by the
construction of the Ignalinskoy power station, Izvestia said,
without giving the date of the session.
   The power plant was built to withstand seismic shocks that
measure 6 on the scale used in the Soviet Union, although an
earthquake rated at 7 on the same scale shook that area of the
Baltic republic at the turn of the century, Izvestia said.
   The first deputy secretary of the Lithuanian state environmental
committee, Y. Sabalyauskas, told the Council of Ministers a whole
range of safety violations was committed during construction of the
plant's first reactor, and that the safety breaches were repeated
during the building of the third unit.
   As a result of the meeting, Lithuanian authorities and the
Moscow-based ministries of atomic energy and medium-machine
building decided to freeze work on the third reactor pending ``full
answers to all questions of safety.''
   The officials also asked the Soviet Council of Ministers to
create a government commission to study problems raised by the
nuclear plant's construction, the Izvestia report said.

<HEAD>American Indian Movement At 20 Quietly Continues Struggle</HEAD>

   Twenty years after it was founded, the
American Indian Movement continues to struggle for American Indian
rights, but its methods are quiet compared to the violence and
confrontation that marked its early days.
   ``The American Indian Movement broke a hole through the wall and
everyone else came through,'' said Rosemary Ackley Christensen,
director of Indian education for Minneapolis Public Schools.
   ``People may not have always liked the form these strategies
took, but I appreciate what these men have done.''
   Other Indian leaders are critical of AIM's legacy.
   ``The violence of their tactics created a backlash against
people on the reservations,'' said Tim Giago, editor of the Lakota
Times, a weekly Indian newspaper in Martin, S.D.
   ``AIM got a lot of national attention, but not all of it was
good attention. It upset people in Congress, who voted against
bills that would have helped American Indians. We're still
recovering from that,'' Giago said.
   The group began a 20th-anniversary celebration Thursday at Fort
Snelling State Park featuring dancers and drum groups from around
the country and speeches by AIM leaders.
   ``We have much to celebrate,'' said spokesman Vernon Bellecourt,
whose brother Clyde was an AIM founder and is now its executive
director. ``But we have to look at the fact that our lands and
resources are still being exploited.''
   One of the organization's first acts was organizing a patrol to
monitor allegations of police harassment and brutality against
Indians in Minneapolis.
   But the concerns that brought about 150 Indians to a July 28,
1968, meeting _ such as housing, education and jobs _ went beyond
the borders of Minnesota, and often were overshadowed by AIM
tactics.
   AIM gained notoriety with the 1972 seizure of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs building in Washington, D.C., and a 1973 riot at the
Custer, S.D., courthouse.
   The 71-day reservation occupation at Wounded Knee, S.D., left
two Indians dead and a federal marshall permanently paralyzed.
   Felony charges against AIM activists Russell Means and Dennis
Banks, who led the uprising, were dismissed after an eight-week
trial.
   A 1975 shootout at Pine Ridge reservation at Wounded Knee left
two FBI agents dead and got AIM activist Leonard Peltier two life
prison terms.
   Christensen, who has no formal ties to AIM, said the violence
during the early years divided the Indian community, but she would
not judge AIM leaders.
   ``God knows, the FBI and white people had a hell of a lot more
weapons and other things than Indians had,'' Christensen said. ``I
respect and admire people who are not going to give up against all
odds.''
   AIM activists in the early 1970s also opened schools and
organized legal rights and job training projects.
   Don Allery, historian for the Red Lake Tribe, said he was
involved with AIM during its formative years but became
disenchanted when it didn't follow through on complaints about such
things as job discrimination.
   ``The route they took, I guess it served a purpose,'' Allery
said. But he said he thinks AIM failed ``on anything that required
a consistent, on-going followup.''
   Vernon Bellecourt said the movement in 1988 has ``taken on a new
character.''
   Protecting treaty rights and sacred Indian burial grounds are
among today's goals, he said, as well as protecting the interests
of Indian nations throughout the world.
   Means, who has resigned, feels AIM is no longer necessary.
   ``AIM people are now integrated into every productive and
responsible segment of Indian and non-Indian society,'' said Means,
who lost his campaign to become Libertarian Party candidate for
president this year. ``The American Indian Movement has
accomplished the impossible: AIM has worked itself out of a job.''
   Giago said the need for political advocacy continues. But he
said AIM's negative image in many people's minds may hamper its
efforts.
   ``We need a militant group. Somebody's got to keep stirring the
pot because our numbers are so small,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Says ICBM Treaty Possible in 2-3 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Soviet arms control official said Thursday
the superpowers could agree on a treaty limiting intercontinental
nuclear forces before the end of the year, ``if we still use all
the possibilities.''
   Viktor Karpov, the Soviet foreign ministry's top arms control
official, said such a treaty was possible ``within two or three
months.
   ``However, if you mark time ... then there will be no such
chance,'' he told a news conference, speaking through an
interpreter.
   Karpov was responding to questions about U.S. demands that the
Soviet Union dismantle its partially completed radar installation
at Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, before agreement on a treaty on
intercontinential nuclear weapons is possible.
   The United States put forth that position in a statement
Wednesday at the close of a one-week conference reviewing the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Karpov headed the Soviet delegation.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators have conducted separate talks in
Geneva on long-range, or strategic missiles, since March 1985. They
have agreed in principle to reduce such arsenals by 50 percent, but
a number of details have yet to be resolved.
   In December, the superpowers signed a treaty to destroy
medium-and shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   The Soviets have constantly linked an agreement on long-range
missiles to restrictions on the Reagan administration's space-based
missile defense system, known officially as the Strategic Defense
Initiative and popularly called ``Star Wars.'' The United States
has rejected such a linkage.
   Karpov said that the Soviet Union had repeated to the United
States an offer to dismantle the equipment of the Krasnoyarsk
radar, if the United States would agree to commit itself to the ABM
treaty for nine or 10 years.
   The Soviets originally made that offer in July, speaking of a
period of 10 years. The United States said at the time it welcomed
the offer to dismantle the radar but that it would not accept the
conditions imposed on the offer.
   The United States maintains that the Krasnoyarsk radar violates
the ABM treaty because it could be used to help direct the Soviet
response to a nuclear missile attack. The Soviets say the radar is
designed to track space objects, and therefore doesn't violate the
treaty.
   The ABM treaty limits the anti-missile defense systems that each
side can build.
   Karpov said that the Soviets were willing to dismantle two other
radars deployed last year in Gomel, near Kiev, which the United
States also has complained about.
   ``We would be prepared to destroy the elements,'' Karpov said.
   The U.S. statement Wednesday said that the Soviet Union, during
the review conference, did not satisfy U.S. concerns about the
Krasnoyarsk radar, and that the United States may take action to
suspend or terminate the ABM treaty.
   Karpov seemed to appeal for restraint, saying that ``unilateral
actions in such a serious matter as the ABM treaty are
inadmissable.''

<HEAD>Lawyers Doubt FDA Can Regulate `Smokeless' Cigarette</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food and Drug Administration lawyers have told
their bosses they doubt the agency has legal authority to regulate
a new type cigarette being tested by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., an
FDA official said Thursday.
   The official, who discussed the internal agency matter only on
grounds he not be identified by name, noted that regulation of
cigarettes has long been reserved to Congress.
   R.J. Reynolds is aware of that, and is making no claim that its
new ``smokeless cigarette'' is anything other than a cigarette, he
said. It will be taxed as a cigarette and carry the same warning
labels Congress requires on conventional cigarettes.
   Moreover, the official said, the company is ``bending over
backward'' not to make any health claim on behalf of its new
cigarette.
   If the manufacturer claimed some health benefit for the new
product _ such as less risk of incurring ailments linked to smoking
_ it might come under FDA jurisdiction.
   The FDA source said agency lawyers have told FDA Commissioner
Frank Young that they would marshall whatever legal arguments they
could find if he decides to attempt regulate the cigarette, but
that they would see little prospect of winning a court battle.
   Because of the way R.J. Reynolds is presenting the new product,
there has been little expectation even by anti-smoking forces that
the FDA would take the position it could regulate the new product.
   However, the agency was obligated to formally consider the
matter because of a petition filed in April by the Washington-based
Coalition on Smoking or Health, which represents the American Heart
Association, American Lung Association, American Cancer Society and
the American Medical Association.

<TEXT>
   Italy's famed La Scala opera troupe opened its
second tour of Japan on Thursday with a stirring rendition of
Verdi's ``Nabucco'' that earned 11 curtain calls.
   Musical Director Riccardo Muti and an 80-member orchestra
brought 3,500 opera fans to their feet at the end of the four-hour
performance.
   ``All of the music was just wonderful,'' said Tadae Nashida, one
of the spectators.
   ``It's a very difficult opera to watch, you need to study the
text carefully first,'' Mrs. Nashida said. ``But the melodies were
so easy to become attached to.''
   The cast was led by baritone Renato Bruson in the title role of
Nabucco, king of Babylon, and tenor Bruno Beccaria as Ismael,
nephew of the king of Jerusalem.
   But charismatic bass Paata Burchuladze as the high priest
Zaccaria, and powerful soprano Ghena Dimitrova as Nabucco's jealous
adopted daughter Abigaille stole the show and grabbed the loudest
applause of the 13{-minute ovation.
   ``We expect a triumph,'' said Renato Garavaglia, chief of La
Scala's press office, before the show.
   ``1981 was very triumphant for us,'' Garavaglia said of La
Scala's previous visit to Japan. ``Japanese people are better than
we expected.''
   La Scala Director General Carlo Maria Badini said he was
delighted with the audience's reaction to Nabucco.
   ``It was a fantastic reaction: intelligent, passionate. These
people know well the Italian music,'' Badini said backstage at
Tokyo's NHK Hall.
   ``But Nabucco is not one of Verdi's popular operas. It's not
like La Traviata,'' he said. ``It's very important to show it to
the Japanese public ... we're making it into a popular Verdi
opera.''
   The Milan-based opera shipped to Japan the stunning sets for
which it is renowned, with only slight alterations necessary.
   ``The technicians know very well this theater, where we played
in 1981,'' Garavaglia said. ``There are some adjustments, a little
cut of scenes, but it's not a problem because our scenes are
elastic.''
   The dazzling sets of huge snarling lions, or tremendous sweeping
wings drew gasps from Thursday's audience who paid up to 40,000 yen
(298 U.S. dollars) to attend opening night.
   They were luckier than opera afficionados in Seoul, South Korea,
where last week La Scala performed Puccini's ``Turandot'' _ minus
the lavish set, which had been shipped to Tokyo.
   ``That was a good audience too. They appreciated it very much
with nine minutes of applause,'' said Garavaglia. ``For Seoul that
is very good.''
   La Scala's month-long, 16-show tour of Tokyo and Yokohama
includes Turandot, Puccini's ``La Boheme'' and Bellini's ``I
Capuleti e i Montecchi.''
   Equipment was shipped over in 63 40-foot containers, and it took
150 trucks to deliver the sets, costumes and props for Nabucco and
Turandot alone.
   About 550 performers, musicians and machinists made the trip
from Italy, and 200 extras have been hired from the foreign
community for the crowd scenes.

   Businesses scrambled to find emergency generators
and city crews hustled to lay new cable Thursday, a day after a
fire caused a 40-block blackout that officials feared could last
until the weekend.
   The fire, of undetermined origin, wrecked a double underground
vault containing two transformers and switching equipment
Wednesday, cutting electricity to much of the city's retail,
financial and hotel center.
   Power can't be restored before ``tomorrow evening or early
Saturday,'' Julia Greenlee of Seattle City Light said Thursday.
   ``Friday evening is our target, and we're pulling out all
stops,'' said Marsha Iverson, another utility official.
   The number of residents, workers, businesses and hotel guests
affected by the outage was undetermined, said Hugh McIntosh, City
Light's chief spokesman. ``We've got about 40 blocks here, (with
buildings) ranging from one story to 41 stories ... thin, fat,
short and tall. It would take a week to count them all.''
   City Light officials said it was utility's worst outage ever,
eclipsing an 80-block downtown blackout that was limited to five
hours in 1966.
   Police doubled patrols overnight and no looting or injuries were
reported.
   Uncounted hundreds of workers were sent home early Wednesday,
many night spots were dark and some restaurants served free food
rather than have it spoil. Numerous businesses remained closed
Thursday.
   With street lights and traffic signals dark, police directed
traffic at most intersections during business hours and erected
stop signs at other times.
   Tangles of twisted, scorched cable littered Virginia Street,
where the vault was located. A trailer bearing a spool of new cable
was parked near a cluster of utility trucks.
   Buildings affected by the outage ranged from Show World,
featuring peep shows and nude dancers, to the palatial Cinerama,
where showings of ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' were canceled _
a feat fundamentalist protesters had failed to accomplish since the
film opened a few weeks earlier.
   Others fared better. David Sivinski, proprietor of a
propane-powered popcorn wagon, said his booming business Wednesday
night represented ``the revenge of low-tech.''
   The Warwick Hotel staff bought 150 flashlights for guests, said
Cyndy Sparhawk, director of sales. Emergency power was enough to
maintain elevator service, hot water and hall lights but no room
lights, said Kevin Klein, a front office assistant manager.
   The fire knocked out two $35,000 transformers; six primary
cables, each carrying 13,000 volts and feeding 15 transformers, and
about two dozen secondary cables, each carrying 110 or 208 volts,
said Gerd Jerochim, manager of underground operations and street
lighting.
   Electricity cannot be restored piecemeal, and at least five of
the primary cables must be replaced for service to resume, Jerochim
said. He said that if just one cable were reactivated, it would
draw the electricity for all six and burn out. An estimated 3,000
feet of cable must be replaced.
   Jerochim estimated the utility's costs for labor, equipment and
materials at $250,000, excluding police and firefighting expenses
and private business losses.

<TEXT>
   The state filed civil rights charges Thursday
against three state Senate court officers, accusing them of using
excessive force and abusive language in removing gay rights
demonstrators from the Senate gallery in January.
   ``The commonwealth seeks to insure that the defendants do not
further assault or harass persons because of their sexual
orientation, race, color, or national origin,'' said Attorney
General James Shannon's complaint, filed in Suffolk Superior Court.
   The state also seeks to guarantee that the officers ``do not use
excessive force, illegally detain or illegally arrest persons who
are participating in the expression of their political views,'' the
complaint said.
   The complaint stems from a Jan. 4 demonstration over Senate
delays in passing a gay rights bill. It was brought against court
officers Conrad Bailey, Thomas Sheehan and William Marcelonis.
   Shannon's complaint seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting the
three from policing any demonstration until they receive
appropriate training in police techniques.
   ``This is a message that needs to be sent over and over again
until everyone finally learns it, that in Massachusetts you cannot
harass people nor can you beat people up because of their sexual
orientation,'' said Kevin Cathcart, executive director of the Gay
and Lesbian Political Caucus.
   Fourteen to 20 demonstrators participated in the protest inside
the Senate chamber questioning a Senate committee's refusal to
release a gay rights bill _ supported by Shannon _ to ban
discrimination in employment, housing, credit and public
accommodations based on a person's sexual orientation.
   During the protest, some demonstrators shouted down to the
senators, urging them to pass the bill. Others handcuffed
themselves together.
   Court officers, who have sole police jurisdiction in the Senate,
removed 14 demonstrators and turned them over to Capitol Police.
The demonstrators were charged with trespassing. In March, six were
found innocent and charges against the others were later dismissed.
   Shannon's complaint alleges that Bailey threw one demonstrator
into a gallery chair when the man started to speak to the Senate,
yanked another by his tie until it ripped, grabbed another
demonstrator by his hair, dragged another over a chair and struck
others with a rolled-up newspaper.
   Marcelonis allegedly grabbed the shirt of another demonstrator
and pushed his hand into the man's face. Sheehan was accused of
repeatedly kicking one demonstrator while the man was carried from
the gallery.
   All three allegedly used anti-gay epithets, the complaint said.

<HEAD>Teamsters and Producers Open Talks to Avert Possible Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contract talks between Teamsters drivers and
Hollywood producers convened Thursday, one day after the union
overwhelmingly rejected the producers' last offer.
   The Teamsters, who have been working for more than a month
without a contract, voted against the proposed contract by more
than a 95 percent margin, according to Earl Bush,
secretary-treasurer for the Teamsters Local 399.
   The tally, announced early Thursday, was 1,409 to 67 against the
offer, Bush said.
   A walkout by the Teamsters, representing 2,200 film and
television drivers, could hobble Hollywood production, which
returned to work only recently following a five-month
scriptwriters' strike.
   Bush said the producers' contract proposal would require about
half the members of Local 399 to take $2.61-per-hour pay cuts,
lowering their pay to $14 per hour.
   ``We'll negotiate as long as there's meaningful negotiations
going on,'' Bush said.
   The negotiations were expected to last throughout the day, and
there was no immediate news of any progress.
   The Teamsters contract expired July 30, but the powerful union
has continued to work by day-to-day extensions.
   Meanwhile, officials of Plasterers Local 755 and of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 40 have
announced that their members have also rejected management's offer
by overwhelming votes.
   The Teamsters, like the plasterers and electricians, are also
unhappy with a new overtime formula suggested by the producers.
Under the new plan, union members would be paid overtime for
Saturday and Sunday work only if more than five days had been
worked in a row. Teamsters normally collect overtime pay for any
weekend work regardless of the circumstances.
   The producers have said that union concessions are necessary to
keep costs down and prevent ``runaway'' productions, where film and
televison crews move to non-union work sites.

   Michael Crawford turns in his mask and cape as
``The Phantom of the Opera'' on Oct. 8 and will be replaced in the
hit Broadway musical by opera singer Timothy Nolen.
   Crawford, who won a Tony Award as the deformed composer in the
lavish Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, has played the role in London
and New York and may star in the Los Angeles company which opens
next spring.
   Nolen, who takes over as the phantom Oct. 10, made his operatic
debut in 1968 with the San Francisco Opera. He played the title
role in the Houston Grand Opera's world premiere of ``Willie
Stark,'' which later was televised on PBS. He also starred in
``Sweeney Todd'' for the Houston company as well as for the New
York City Opera.
   Nolen also appeared on Broadway in 1985 in ``Grind,'' a
short-lived musical set in a Chicago burlesque house.

<HEAD>Officials Confident They'll Meet Smog Standards _ 20 Years Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern California smog-control
officials say they'll meet federal clean-air standards _ maybe 20
years late, but they'll do it.
   ``By the year 2010, air quality will be at least as good as in
the San Francisco area, probably better,'' said Carolyn Green of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the clean-air
agency for the four-county Los Angeles basin.
   On Wednesday, an Environmental Protection Agency ban took effect
preventing the construction of big factories in the region. The ban
is expected to have little impact since no large factories or
industrial projects are planned for the Los Angeles basin.
   The area, which has the nation's worst smog, failed to meet the
Dec. 31, 1987, deadline for achieving minimum smog standards set by
the federal Clean Air Act.
   But Norton Younglove, chairman of the South Coast air-quality
board, said the agency had cracked down recently on some of the

   IRA supporters fired at a
police station and hurled firebombs at security forces, who shot
back with plastic bullets and injured three people before dawn
Thursday, police said.
   The violence was touched off by the killing of three Irish
Republican Army guerrillas. Police said British troops ambushed the
three on Tuesday as they drove along a country road, armed and
wearing ski masks.
   Rioting broke out in Roman Catholic areas of Belfast on
Wednesday night and continued until dawn, police said.
   The three injured were taken to a hospital after the clash near
Falls Road, an IRA stronghold in west Belfast. Their condition was
not immediately known.
   Youths set fire to a bus, two vans and more than 35 cars and
hurled gasoline bombs and rocks at security forces, while a gunman
fired on the city's New Barnsley police station, police said.
   Thursday night, half a dozen cars were stolen in the Falls Road
area, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity, but it was
not on the scale of the previous violence.
   Two brothers killed in Tuesday's ambush, Gerard and Martin
Harte, will be buried Friday, and the third man, Brian Mullen, will
be buried Saturday. Police said all three were known IRA operatives.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in an interview published
Thursday, said the recent increase in IRA attacks ``strengthens the
resolve of the British government that Northern Ireland is part of
the United Kingdom and will remain so.''
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive Britain from
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite the province
with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   Police said they found a submachine gun, a pistol and ammunition
in an empty west Belfast house, and seized an air pistol and
bomb-making equipment in a raid on the Strabane office of Sinn
Fein, the outlawed IRA's legal political wing.
   They said a bomb planted by a masked man exploded near a gas
station at Strabane on the Irish border 60 miles west of Belfast.
No injuries were reported.
   The IRA launched a stepped-up campaign against the British army
this summer, but suffered three blows in quick succession this
week, starting with Tuesday's ambush, followed Wednesday by a
bombing blunder that killed two civilians in Londonderry and the
arrest of two IRA suspects in West Germany.
   Spreading its bombing and shooting campaign to mainland Britain
and continental Europe, the IRA has killed 27 British military men
this year, including eight in a bus bombing in the west of the
province on Aug. 20.
   That attack prompted a British pledge to crack down on the IRA.
Tuesday's ambush killing, apparently by an elite anti-guerrilla
squad, was seen as the start of the counterattack.
   ``Blows on three fronts for the IRA,'' headlined The Times of
London.
   West German authorities Thursday said two alleged IRA members
captured near the Dutch border are prime suspects in recent
bombings of British military installations in West Germany.
   The men were caught Wednesday with a weapon believed to have
been used in a shootout in the Netherlands that killed a Royal Air
Force member in May, they said.
   Mrs. Thatcher was quoted as saying the IRA and its supporters
``think that if they step up terrorism it will weaken our resolve
to stay in the province. Quite the reverse is true. Terrorism will
not win.''
   She refused to spell out what new measures against the IRA were
adopted, ``But my message to them is this: Do not doubt our resolve
to defeat terrorism.''
   The Irish government called for an urgent meeting with British
officials and said, ``The frightening escalation of violence
undermines the very maintenance of the rule of law.''
   A senior Sinn Fein official, Martin McGuinness, criticized
Wednesday's bungled IRA operation, which killed Sean Dalton, 55,
and Sheila Lewis, 60, in Londonderry.
   Dalton broke into a neighbor's apartment, concerned he had not
seen its occupant for several days, and triggered a bomb rigged by
the IRA to blow up an army squad. Mrs. Lewis was standing on a
balcony outside.
   The IRA apologized and said, ``Although the operation was
carefully planned, it went tragically wrong.''
   McGuinness said he was not criticizing the IRA as a whole, ``but
I do have a responsibility to criticize individual IRA operations
that result in civilian deaths. This tragic accident raises a
number of questions which the IRA must answer.''
   Eleven IRA members have died violently this year, and 20
civilians have been killed in botched IRA operations.

   A bomb threat that forced a Northwest
Airlines jet carrying 255 people to return to Detroit Metropolitan
Airport on Thursday was a hoax, officials said.
   The threat was phoned into the airline's reservation center at
the airport and relayed to the control tower, Nancy Mouradian of
the Wayne County Sheriff's Department said.
   Flight 333, bound for Los Angeles, landed at 10:25 a.m. and was
searched, she said. Passengers on the DC-10 got off, the plane was
moved to an inactive runway and searched.
   No one was injured.
   Mouradian said she didn't know who made the threat or how much
time elapsed between the flight's takeoff and return.
   A spokesman for the airline said all information was being
withheld.
   Mouradian said the plane had been cleared to return to service
later Thursday.

<HEAD>More Kurds Flee From Iraq; U.S. Concerned About Reported Chemical
Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Iraqi Kurds have fled to Iran
after government bombardments and chemical attacks, an official
Iranian report said Thursday.
   Also Thursday, Iran's Parliament Speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
suggested Turkey close its pipelines to Iraqi oil.
   The United States expressed concern about reports Iraq used
chemical weapons in its latest assault on Kurdish rebel strongholds
in the mountainous northeastern part of the country.
   Diplomats in Baghdad say Iraq has taken advantage of the Aug. 20
cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war with Iran to intensify
operations against the autonomy-seeking Kurds, who sided with the
Iranians.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 900 Kurdish
families arrived in northwestern Iran. The agency quoted a senior
Iranian official as telling a visiting Turkish envoy that Iraq was
planning to ``exterminate'' its Kurdish population.
   Turkey says it has allowed 20,000 Kurdish refugees into the
country and the number is expected to rise.
   The refugees in Iran _ elderly men, women and children _ were
being settled temporarily in the towns of Piranshahr and Orumieh in
West Azarbaijan province, said IRNA, monitored in Cyprus.
   The report said 300 of the families arrived via Turkey while the
rest came directly from Iraq, fleeing shelling and chemical
weapons. It did not specify the number of people involved.
   An official of the Kurdish Democratic Party, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that Iraq's offensive began
Monday with at least 60,000 troops backed by ``tanks, aircraft,
helicopter gunships, artillery and chemical weapons.''
   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
   Rafsanjani, who spoke in an interview on Iranian television that
was monitored in Cyprus, said there was ``nothing'' Iran could do
to prevent Iraqi attacks on Kurdish rebels or civilians.
   ``The only help we can offer is to protect the refugees who come
to Iran,'' he said. ``Of course, the world can stop (the attacks)
by putting Iraq under pressure.
   ``For instance, if Turkey closed its pipelines to Iraq to stop
it from exporting its oil, as well as other actions by other
countries, then this criminal regime will be forced to stop its
criminal acts.''
   The two pipelines, which take oil to Mediterranean ports, were
built to help Iraq export its oil during the war when the Persian
Gulf was closed to Iraqi shipping.
   In Washington, the State Department expressed concern about
reports of Iraqi chemical attacks.
   ``If the reports are accurate, this is a grave violation of
international human rights standards,'' said deputy spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley, noting that use of chemical weapons was condemned
in a U.N. Security Council resolution approved last week.
   She commended the Turkish government for offering temporary
shelter to Kurdish refugees.
   In Geneva, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Wednesday the
world body was taking no action following allegations of the
chemical attacks, saying there was no independent confirmation.
U.N.-appointed experts say Iraq has used the weapons against Iran
and the United Nations has condemned their use during the war.
   IRNA quoted Deputy Prime Minister for Political Affairs Alireza
Moayyeri as saying ``the Iraqi regime aims to exterminate its
Kurdish population.''
   It said he made the comment during a meeting with Nuzhei
Kandemir, an undersecretary in Turkey's Foreign Ministry, in Tehran
on an official visit.

<HEAD>Former Missouri Congresswoman Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leonor K. Sullivan, a 12-term member of the
U.S. House and the only woman ever elected to Congress from
Missouri, died Thursday of heart failure. She was 86.
   Sullivan died at St. Anthony's Medical Center, where she had
been admitted Aug. 21, her 86th birthday, said hospital spokesman
Bill Feustel. She had heart and respiratory problems in recent
years.
   Sullivan began her political career after she married U.S. Rep.
John B. Sullivan in 1941. For the next 10 years she aided him in
his work serving the 3rd Congressional District, which includes
south St. Louis. Her husband died in 1951.
   A year later, the Democrat was elected to her husband's former
U.S. House seat. She held her seat until she stepped down in 1976.
Sullivan was succeeded by Rep. Richard Gephardt, who remains the
3rd District representative.
   ``She was a distinguished and an effective legislator, much
loved by the people of St. Louis,'' Gephardt said. `Her
contributions to our community and the nation will have
long-lasting effects.''
   During her years in Congress, Sullivan became a noted
environmentalist and consumer advocate. She pushed for preservation
of environmental resources and improved employment conditions, as
well as consumer protection laws for foods, drugs and cosmetics. In
1954, she was an author of legislation creating the food-stamp
program.
   Sullivan is survived by three sisters. Arrangments for her
funeral were pending.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis said Thursday that Vice President George Bush was ``playing
hooky'' when the Reagan administration slashed education programs.
   In a speech for the Oakland public school system's
back-to-school day, the Massachusetts governor said voters this
fall have a choice ``between those who see education as a lifetime
commitment and those who see it as an election-year strategy.''
   The hard-hitting speech followed a pattern set in recent days by
the Democratic nominee, who has markedly stepped up his attacks on
Bush.
   Upon arrival in California late Wednesday night, Dukakis
described Bush as ``one of the charter members of the environmental
wrecking crew which went to Washington in 1981.''
   He said Bush, while opposing offshore oil drilling in California
where it is politically unpopular, recently supported it in Texas.
   He said the nation needed ``a president whose environmental
policy doesn't change with the time zones.''
   Dukakis was on a brief pre-Labor Day West Coast campaign swing
through California, Oregon and Washington.
   While he was away, a poll by the Boston Herald showed Dukakis
running neck and neck with Bush in Massachusetts, compared with a
poll in July that gave Dukakis a 14-point lead. The newest poll,
giving both candidates 42 percent, reflected the responses of 400
registered voters contacted Wednesday. The poll had a five-point
margin of error.
   Dukakis said he wasn't worried carrying his home state, and
spokesman Dayton Duncan said: ``We're very confident Michael
Dukakis will carry Massachusetts. We're also confident he will
carry George Bush's other home states _ Maine, Texas, Washington,
D.C., and any others he claims.''
   In his education speech, Dukakis also portrayed the difference
between himself and Bush as one ``between those who believe that
good education should be the property of a few and those who
believe it is the birthright of every American, no matter who they
are or where they come from or what the color of their skin.''
   He charged the Reagan administration has eliminated remedial
math and reading programs for 500,000 poor children, while in
Massachusetts he started an ``essential skills'' program. The
Reagan administration sought cuts in the remedial programs in 1981
but was unsuccessful. In an April 1988 report, the Education
Department said the number of children in remedial programs had
dropped from 5 million in 1979-80 to 4.5 million in the 1985-86
school year.
   ``While they've been lecturing teachers and cutting teacher
retraining programs, we've invested in `professional development
centers' to help our teachers keep pace with changing times,'' he
said.
   ``And where was George while all this was going on? Where was
the man who now says he wants to be the `education president?' He
was playing hooky. He was nowhere to be found.''
   He said the Reagan administration was investing billions of
dollars in Star Wars while in his state ``we've developed a
region-wide network of star schools.''
   Dukakis first stop of the day was at the California Musuem of
Science and Industry where he met with a participant in the Los
Angeles Education partnership, a program under which private
industry assists urban public schools.
   ``I think what you're doing is terrific,'' Dukakis said. ``There
is no way under the sun the federal treasury, given the red ink
it's looking at, can do this by itself.''
   Participating in the meeting was Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
who told Dukakis that the schools need help because students are
dropping out ``before the fourth grade.''

   A memorial service on Thursday, marking
the anniversary of S. Brian Willson's failed bid to halt a Navy
munitions train, was marred by blaring horns, obscene chants and
signs mocking Willson, who lost his legs when the train struck him.
   ``We came to protest these crazy people,'' said Jack Withrow,
65, of Sacramento, a World War II veteran and one of about 15
people who appeared at the Concord Naval Weapons Station to oppose
the service.
   He carried a sign which read, ``You supply legs, we'll supply
arms.''
   Willson, a 47-year-old Vietnam veteran who has become a martyr
to the anti-war movement since he was injured last Sept. 1, seemed
more saddened than angry at the demonstrators.
   ``It's not going to stop people blocking the trains,'' he said.
``If they want to murder people, I suggest they sign up and go to
Central America and do it. Don't ask somebody else to do it.''
   The service took place on the tracks where Willson and others
tried to halt the train as part of a protest opposing U.S.
involvement in Central America. The others managed to scramble off
the tracks, but Willson was hit.
   The train, whose crew had been ordered not to stop to avoid
allowing demonstrators to climb on board, severed one leg and the
other was amputated later.
   Eight white crosses stood Thursday between the rails near where
the tracks enter the base, the target of daily demonstrations since
Willson was injured. A rainbow of crepe paper rose near the
chainlink fence which guards the area near the gate.
   ``I am celebrating personally having survived 365 days and I'm
very thankful I'm alive and you're alive here today,'' Willson told
the crowd of about 100 people gathered to mark the incident.
   ``I encourage all of us to continue asking, `How much do we want
peace?'''
   During the service, trucks and cars passed with horns and radios
blaring as passengers shouted obscene slogans in an effort to drown
out the proceedings. Some passed out a package that included an
organ donor card and a copy of a last will and testament.
   The Navy has said it is concerned about the safe transportation
of explosives across a 200-foot intersection near the demonstration
site and wants to build a $10 million overpass to take vehicles
over the highway.
   About 325 arrests have been made over the past year, but not one
person has been convicted.
   Also complaining about the on-going protests are many residents
of the neighboring town of Clyde, population 450. They contend the
rag-tag encampment of sleeping bags, lawn chairs, picket signs and
American flags is an unkempt eyesore.
   If the protesters asked, said Willson, he would tell them that
he is ``speaking the truth of my heart.''

   Jesse Jackson said Thursday that ``I will
campaign for voter registration and voter turnout in every state
that I can get to'' for the Democratic ticket.
   Jackson denied that aides to Democratic candidate Michael
Dukakis had tried to keep Jackson from campaigning for Dukakis in
some states.
   ``I have seen no such list,'' Jackson told reporters after
meeting with Dukakis campaign officials on a joint voter
registration effort.
   He said he will concentrate on reaching farmers, trade unionists
and students.
   ``In some instances we'll speak directly for, as a surrogate
for, the ticket,'' Jackson said, while elsewhere he will represent
the Democratic Party or his own ``rainbow coalition'' wing of the
party.
   He said he would ``focus so hard'' on those groups because ``I
would hate to wake up on the morning of Nov. 9 (the day after the
election) and hate to think that we lost by the lack of my work.''
   Jackson, the civil rights activist and former Dukakis rival for
the party's nomination, said the transition toward a unified
campaign ``in some states has gone very well, in some states it is
incomplete.''
   Jackson predicted that ``the remaining areas of incompleteness''
will be resolved in the next few days.
   Some of the 70 party officials and campaign workers from the
Southeast who attended the meeting attributed reports of alleged
restraints on Jackson's campaign appearances in some states to
tensions arising from the merger of the Dukakis and Jackson
organizations.
   ``There are always problems during a campaign ... but I haven't
seen any evidence that a great divisiveness exists,'' said Jackson
adviser Bert Lance, former White House budget director under
President Carter.
   The meeting Thursday was called by Jackson to discuss voter
registration. But Joseph Gardner, director of operations in
Jackson's Chicago office, said in advance that he expected the
group to discuss the extent to which Dukakis has fulfilled his
pledge to bring Jackson supporters into his campaign.
   Sources close to Jackson had said Wednesday that he was angered
because Dukakis aides had told him to avoid campaigning in
Michigan, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, New York and
Alabama.
   ``I have no knowledge of that,'' Jackson said on NBC-TV's
``Today'' show Thursday.
   Dukakis said in California that he would meeting with some
leaders of the Jackson campaign who ``are already becoming a very
important part of our campaign'' in that state.
   Gardner said transition problems were serious in Georgia, where
the Rev. Cameron Alexander, a Jackson supporters, took his name off
the list of nine co-chairmen of the state Dukakis campaign,
charging that the state party was giving only token attention to
blacks.
   Larry Harrington, Dukakis' Southern political director who
attended the meeting here, said the party had made ``a significant
and a successful effort'' to involve Jackson supporters at all
levels of the campaign.
   ``I don't really think there's a serious problem. But if he
(Jackson) identifies some problems then we'll work with him,''
Harrington said.
   Others at the meeting, including Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and
Bobby Kahn, executive director of the Georgia Democratic Party,
denied suggestions of a rift.

   The court-martial for the former head of
a rescue-swimmer school neared its conclusion Thursday, one of two
court-martial proceedings under way in the death of a recruit.
   A panel of four officers was to hear closing arguments Thursday
afternoon in the dereliction-of-duty court-martial of Lt. Thomas A.
Torchia, the officer in charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School
when Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, died March 2.
   Mirecki, of Appleton, Wis., had a phobia about being pulled
under water and suffered a fear-induced attack before drowning, a
Navy pathologist testified in the Torchia trial.
   Instructors had thrown the panic-striken recruit into a swimming
pool after he climbed out and shouted he wanted to quit the
voluntary training, witnesses have said.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael W. Combe, 28, of Tempe, Ariz.,
also faces a court-martial in the case and attorneys argued for
dismassal of the charges before a military judge on Thursday. Combe
is accused of holding Mirecki's head under the water.
   He is charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery and
conspiracy to commit battery. If convicted, he could get up to a
three-year prison term on the manslaughter count.
   The maximum punishment Torchia faces is a fine of two months
pay, a reprimand and loss of seniority for promotion, but a defense
lawyer says that is enough to put his career on the line. Torchia,
32, is from Princeton, Ill.
   In their dismissal motion, Combe's lawyers have alleged that
Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education and training, was
unqualified to convene the general court-martial because he had a
personal interest in the case and had been influenced by others
against the defendant.
   The military judge, Cmdr. Newell D. Krogmann, had rejected the
same motion last week in Torchia's case.
   Thunman denied the allegations in testimony Wednesday. The
admiral's lawyer, Capt. Robert Vander Lugt, took the witness stand
Thursday to support Thunman's testimony.
   The pretrial hearing was recessed Thursday until prosecution and
defense lawyers could make legal arguments on the issue.
   In his testimony Wednesday, Thunman revealed that an
investigation initially resulted in a recommendation for no
disciplinary action. He said charges weren't filed until it was
reopened with a different officer leading the probe.
   ``I felt we had to go a lot further,'' Thunman said.
   Thunman earlier denied reports that the Navy failed to fully
investigate until pressured by the press and Mirecki's family and
congressman.
   In addition to the two court-martial cases, the investigation
also led to non-judicial punishment for five other Navy men,
including a letter of reprimand to Torchia's former boss,
now-retired Capt. C.L. Lavinder who had headed the Naval Aviation
Schools Command.

<HEAD>Shrinking Sea Could Prompt Soviets To Divert Siberian Waters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shrinking of the Aral Sea, formerly the
world's fourth-largest lake, could prompt the Soviet Union to
revive a plan to divert water into the sea from Siberian rivers, a
U.S. analyst concludes.
   ``The campaign has already begun,'' wrote Philip P. Micklin,
professor in the geography department at Western Michigan
University, in a survey of the Aral's problems in this week's issue
of Science magazine, dated Friday.
   As rivers feeding it were diverted for irrigation, the Aral,
about 250 miles east of the Caspian Sea, shrank 40 percent from its
1960 size of 26,000 square miles (as big as West Virginia or
Ireland). It is now the sixth-largest lake.
   If current trends continue _ there was zero inflow in 1986 _ the
lake could reach 9,000 square miles in 2000, Soviet scientists have
estimated.
   In the 1970s and 1980s, the National Water Management Design
Institute drew plans for a huge diversion of the Ob and Irtysh
rivers in western Siberia, for both irrigation and to help the
Aral, 1,550 miles away.
   These plans were attacked by scientists and others ``who foresaw
severe ecological, economic and cultural damage occurring in
northern regions of water export.''
   Final engineering designs for the first stage of 22 million
acre-feet of water per year, a flow as big as the Wabash River in
Indiana, were being drafted in 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev became
leader of the Communist Party.
   In August 1986 the project was halted.
   Gorbachev and his advisers ``see north-south water transfer
projects as a poor investment of scarce resources and believe less
costly, more effective local means of solving water supply
problems'' can be used in dry areas, Micklin wrote.
   A special commission last year reported on plans to preserve one
river delta and safeguard drinking water, but ``the government has
taken no concrete measures to improve the condition of the Aral,''
Micklin said.
   Though party and government officials in the Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan republics have been silent recently, ``scientists,
writers and journalists from the region continue to plead angrily
and sometimes eloquently, in the regional as well as national
press, for action to save the Aral,'' he said.
   ``As the situation worsens, those living around the sea will put
great pressure on the national government to resurrect the Siberian
diversion plan in order to provide minimum inflow to the Aral while
maintaining irrigation.''
   In March, the president of the Uzbeck Academy of Sciences said
publicly the Aral problem could not be solved without the Siberian
diversion.
   Irrigation planners foresaw the reduction in the Aral, and ``a
number of experts saw this as a worthwhile tradeoff: a cubic meter
of river water used for irrigation would bring far more value than
the same cubic meter diverted to the Aral Sea.''
   Warnings to the contrary were not heeded. The unprecedented
changes for such a large body of water have led some Soviet experts
to call it ``one of the very greatest ecological problems of our
century.''
   Today, 47 million tons of salts are blown from the lake bottom
onto 58,000 square miles of adjacent land each year; commercial
fishing has been all but killed, costing an estimated 60,000 jobs;
river delta ecosystems have dried up with major damage to livestock
producers and native game, and summers have become warmer and
winters colder up to 180 miles away.
   Reduction of irrigation by 24 million acre-feet per year could
halt the shrinkage, but Micklin noted ``irrigation is the economic
mainstay of the Aral Sea basin where over 90 percent of the harvest
comes from irrigated lands.''

<HEAD>NEA Says Bush Turned In Assignment on School Issues A Year Late</HEAD>

   It's a year late, but the National Education
Association said Thursday that Vice President George Bush has
finally turned in the assignment that all presidential contenders
were given last summer: a detailed questionnaire about schools and
other issues.
   ``We need to spend more on education,'' Bush wrote. ``Providing
an excellent education is an investment in America's future _ and
it is one of the most basic roles of government.''
   ``The tone is much more positive than we had anticipated,'' said
NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell. But she gave the Republican
presidential nominee an ``Incomplete'' for not answering all the
questions.
   Bush reiterated his campaign promises to expand Head Start and
create a new $500 million ``Merit School'' program to help
disadvantaged children. He also opposed laws that would declare
English the official U.S. language.
   He did not respond directly to some of the 20 questions the NEA
asked on issues ranging from education to Social Security to a
nuclear freeze, but reiterated his support for tuition tax credits
and merit pay, which the NEA opposes.
   Bush, who has said repeatedly that he wants to be ``the
education president,'' ignored the teachers' questionnaire when it
was sent to him last summer.
   Asked why she thought he responded now, Futrell said, ``I think
he filled it out because he finally realizes the NEA is a powerful
political entity in this country.''
   Nearly one-third of the NEA's 1.9 million members are
Republicans, Futrell said, and ``you just don't blow your nose or
fan your hand at 600,000 votes.''
   Futrell, whose union is expected to endorse Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis next Thursday, also defended the Massachusetts
governor's veto of a 1977 bill requiring teachers to recite the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   ``We believe that the Pledge of Allegiance is very critical and
very important as part of the whole effort to teach patriotism in
America. We do not believe that it should be mandated. You cannot
mandate patriotism,'' Futrell told a back-to-school news conference
at the National Press Club.
   Bush has made a campaign issue of Dukakis' 1977 veto of the
mandatory Pledge of Allegiance bill, which the state's highest
court had advised him beforehand was unconstitutional. The
legislature passed it over Dukakis' veto.
   The Massachusetts law would penalize teachers who refuse to lead
daily recitations of the pledge, but Futrell said it is not being
enforced there or in other states with similar laws.
   She said the pledge should not be mandatory for either teachers
or students.
   ``I have sometimes difficulty dealing with people who dont''
stand up to recite the pledge, Futrell said, ``but I respect their
right not to do that. This is a democracy.''
   The NEA has been camped in the corner of the Democrats in the
past three elections, and it is expected to be there again Sept. 8
when it announces the results of a presidential preference poll of
8,400 union activists. It fielded 300 delegates to the Democratic
convention in Atlanta, compared with about 25 at the GOP convention
in New Orleans.
   Futrell said she would like to see the next president gradually
increase the $21 billion Department of Education budget by at least
$5 billion to $9 billion.

   Flowers and cheers greeted shipyard
workers as they ended an 11-day strike Thursday and marched from
the yard to church in what seemed like a victory parade, holding a
cross and Solidarity banners aloft.
   They acted, with some reluctance, on the advice of their leader
Lech Walesa. Supporters chanting ``We thank you'' lined their path
to a nearby Roman Catholic church that has functioned as the
national strike-central.
   The departure had an air of victory even though the more than
3,000 men went through the gate with no guarantee that their main
demand would be met. The government has agreed only to discuss
making the outlawed Solidarity union legal again.
   Strikers massed behind the main gate of the Lenin shipyard in
the early afternoon under brilliant skies. About 2,000 supporters
waited outside in welcome.
   Delegations from three other shipyards joined them for the
formal end of the labor action, agreed upon Thursday morning after
Walesa spoke to them, then they marched out.
   Before the gates opened, the waiting crowd shouted approval for
the strike: ``We will win! We will win! Every Pole is with us!''
   As the men emerged, the chant ``We thank you, we thank you''
arose and the strikers answered, ``We also you, we also you.''
   Someone had used black paint on the main sign to rename the
Lenin shipyard the Solidarity yard.
   A worker began singing the national anthem, ``Poland has not yet
perished while we still live ...'' and the crowd became a sea of
hands making the ``V'' sign of Solidarity. Marchers and onlookers
joined the song.
   The line of marchers stretched hundreds of yards, behind a cross
seven feet high and beneath bobbing Solidarity banners.
   There was little police interference, but some in the crowd were
touchy. When several young officers politely but firmly cleared a
corner, moving about 50 bystanders across the street, they got an
earful from women old enough to be their grandmothers.
   ``Reconciliation? So this is the reconciliation?'' the women
shouted, borrowing a favorite word of the government.
   ``Kiszczak should come here to see this,'' one woman said,
referring to Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, who met with
Walesa the day before.
   Some people handed bouquets of flowers to marching workers on
the road to St. Brygida's church, which became the nerve center of
the nationwide wave of strikes that began Aug. 16.
   In the long file were men carrying bedding on their backs.
Polish strikers occupy their plants rather than leaving them, and
remain inside 24 hours a day.
   Onlookers and marchers struck up a sort of yodel usually heard
in the stands at soccer games, but one old man in a suit and black
beret continued chanting ``Solidarity, Solidarity,'' with a hand
raised in the ``V'' salute.
   When the procession reached the church for a welcoming ceremony
and a Mass celebrated by Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski of Gdansk, people
began a rhythmic clapping that lasted about 10 minutes until the
church was filled.
   Wooden crosses carried by delegations from the four shipyards
were brought to the front along with placards for various groups of
Solidarity activists.
   Among the first in the church was Alojzy Szablewski, a
62-year-old engineer who led the strike committee in the Lenin
shipyard. He walked to the altar and knelt in silent prayer.
   Bishop Goclowski said at the outset of the service: ``I thank
you for your wisdom, you sons of a 1,000-year-old nation which has
always been connected with the church. During this Mass we will
pray not for ourselves, but for our country.''

<HEAD>Lawyers Work Out Details of Bakker Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. RIGSBY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker may be back on
television as soon as next week, the ministry's bankruptcy trustee
said Thursday as lawyers worked on details of Bakker's $165 million
plan to buy back PTL.
   Trustee M.C. Benton said he received offers of $120 million and
$114 million Thursday, the last day he was taking bids for the
ministry's assets. Both were larger than the previously announced
offer of $113 million from Canadian real estate magnate Peter
Thomas, chairman of Samoth Capital Corp.
   Benton said the offers were from American groups and that they
had not been mentioned previously, but he declined to be more
specific. He said he did not anticipate getting an offer higher
than Bakker's.
   A $3 million letter of credit that should be ready in a day or
so will secure Bakker's deal, said his attorney Ryan Hovis during a
news conference at the World Outreach Center at Heritage USA,
headquarters for the PTL.
   Benton and Hovis would release no details about the unidentified
Greek financiers who are backing Bakker's deal.
   New Covenant Partners Inc. is being formed to buy PTL, Hovis
said. The contract being negotiated calls for creditors to get cash
payments and for securing the benefits of major PTL donors.
   The deal calls for Bakker to pay $85 million in cash and to pay
the Internal Revenue Service the money it is owed. That amount is
being disputed.
   Bakker said he will obtain an $80 million mortgage on 1,000
acres of undeveloped property at PTL.
   Hovis said Bakker may lease facilities from the bankruptcy
trustee until the deal can be closed. Benton said during the news
conference that Bakker could be back on the air as early as Sept. 9.
   Benton has until Sept. 10 to bring a buyer to U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Rufus Reynolds, who will decide who gets to buy the ministry,
although his decision can be appealed to U.S. District Court.
   A spokeswoman in Reynolds' office in Greensboro, N.C., said
Thursday the judge could not comment on a pending case. The judge
has not said when he will decide on the buyer, but has said he
wants to sell the ministry as soon as possible to pay off creditors
and keep Heritage USA operating.
   Benton said he had not talked to Reynolds about the possibility
of Bakker regaining control of the ministry he left in March 1987,
when he resigned amid allegations of misuse of money and
revelations of his sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica
Hahn.
   PTL filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987.
   The trustee said the law requires that he secure the best
financial deal for the creditors and that his own opinion of Bakker
is not relevant to his job.
   ``It's not what I believe, it's what bankruptcy law says my
obligation here is,'' Benton said.
   Lawyers said among the things still being discussed are what to
do with Heritage Ministries, a newly formed non-profit organization
that includes the ministry's religious operations.
   The president of Heritage Ministries, Don Edwards, has said he
will not stay if Bakker returns, ``whether he (Bakker) would want
me or not.''
   Heritage Village Church pastor Sam Johnson also has said he
would not remain under Bakker's leadership.

<TEXT>
   Regulators on Thursday extended by a day their
talks with the Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, on a
federal rescue of American Savings and Loan Association of
Stockton, Calif.
   In a statement released late in the day, M. Danny Wall, chairman
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, described the negotiations as
``intensive'' and said any announcement would be delayed by 24
hours.
   According to industry sources, the proposal involves a
contribution of about $500 million from the Bass Group and up to $2
billion in promissory notes from the bank board, which would make
it the largest rescue ever of a single S&L. The largest-to-date is
the $1.3 billion infusion into Vernon Savings and Loan Association
in Texas.
   American is owned by the Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of
America, the second-largest thrift holding holding company in the
nation with $30.2 billion in assets as of June 30.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, would not say what
was holding up a resolution of the talks.
   The bank board on April 21 granted Bass exclusive negotiating
rights on American and had twice given one-month extensions of the
deadline, originally set for July 5. The one-day delay was the
third extension.
   Financial Corp., which first came under regulatory scrutiny in
1984 when it suffered a run on deposits, lost $223.7 million in the
first six months of this year.
   Congressional leaders and executives of First Nationwide Savings
of San Francisco, a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary, which earlier sought
to acquire American, have complained about Bass's exclusive
arrangement.
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., criticized the bank board in
a letter this week, saying ``It would seem a matter of a sound
negotiating posture to maximize competition whenever possible.''
   ``It is essential that there be no appearance of exclusion or
suggestion that any alternative was overlooked,'' St Germain wrote.
   Wall, in his statement Thursday, noted that the failed
negotiations with First Nationwide were longer than the talks with
Bass.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., who is expected to become
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee next year, wrote to Wall
on Wednesday, saying he was concerned about the bank board's plan
to allow American to remain under a state charter when Bass assumes
ownership.
   He said it was ``unprecedented'' for regulators to allow a
rescued thrift institution to remain under a state charter which he
said permitted ``extremely liberal powers.''
   One factor that had delayed a deal in the past appears to be
cleared up. The Bass Group was concerned that the federal
assistance would be subject to California's 11 percent corporate
income tax. That risk would be eliminated by a bill that cleared
the California legislature Tuesday and awaits the governor's
signature.

<TEXT>
   Less than two years after he won re-election in a
historic landslide, Michael Dukakis finds himself in an
embarrassing position at home with a new poll showing him even with
George Bush in Massachusetts and widespread unhappiness with his
recent performance as governor.
   While aides to the Democratic presidential nominee scoffed at
the poll results and predicted Dukakis would defeat Bush handily in
Massachusetts, political observers from both parties were nearly
unanimous in blaming Dukakis' slide on a recent spate of problems
and protests related to the governor's handling of a state budget
crisis.
   Ironically, the presidential poll showing Dukakis and Bush each
with 42 percent support among Massachusetts voters was published
Thursday, a day when the Republican nominee was campaigning behind
enemy lines in Massachusetts and Dukakis was on the West Coast.
   ``I can't believe it _ in Massachusetts?'' a pleased Bush
responded when shown the headline on the story in The Boston
Herald, which commissioned the poll.
   The telephone survey of 400 likely voters was conducted
Wednesday by KRC Research and had a margin of error of five
percentage points. Fifteen percent of the respondents said they
were undecided.
   ``We're out to win here,'' said Republican state Sen. Argeo Paul
Cellucci, the Massachusetts chairman of the Bush campaign.
``Michael Dukakis is in trouble here in Massachusetts.''
   Dukakis said ``no'' when asked whether he was worried about
carrying his home state. Dukakis aides and Democratic political
consultants dismiss talk about Dukakis being threatened in his home
state.
   ``We're very confident Michael Dukakis will carry
Massachusetts,'' said press secretary Dayton Duncan. ``We're also
confident he will carry George Bush's other home states _ Maine,
Texas, Washington, D.C., and any others he claims.''
   ``We're going to do to George Bush in Massachusetts what he said
he did to Geraldine Ferarro in 1984,'' said Jack Corrigan, director
of operations for the Dukakis campaign, a reference to Bush's
statement that he ``kicked a little ass'' in a debate with Ferraro,
the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee.
   ``Yea, George Bush should target Massachusetts, that's my advice
to him,'' said Corrigan.
   Corrigan declined to speculate on factors that allowed Bush to
pull even with Dukakis in Massachusetts only two months after a
poll showed the governor with a 14-point cushion.
   But Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman, reflecting
a consensus among political observers in both parties, said the
reasons behind the poll numbers ``are really very simple.
   ``He has been under intense pressure to balance his
responsibilities as governor and candidate at a time when Michael
has run into some real bumps on the Massachusetts road,'' said
Goldman.
   Those much-publicized ``bumps'' include repeated outcry from
interest groups and legislators, mostly Republicans, related to the
plan Dukakis pushed through the legislature to balance the 1988 and
1989 state budgets by canceling more than $500 million in planned
program expansions and by trimming state aid to cities and towns by
$91 million. Dukakis also supported several narrowly focused tax
measures.
   Since securing the Democratic presidential nomination Dukakis
also has been a frequent target of protests and complaints on
issues ranging from crime in the city of Boston to his plans to
locate a prison in a rural central Massachusetts town. Dukakis has
spent six days in the last three weeks touring different regions of
the state and was met by demonstrators at virtually every stop.
   There also have been complaints from GOP legislators about the
amount of time Dukakis spends out of state, a concern that,
according to the KRC poll, appears to be shared by voters.
   The survey found that 56 percent of the respondents considered
Dukakis' performance as governor during his presidential campaign
``not effective'' while 33 percent rated him ``effective'' and 11
percent said they didn't know whether he had been effective.
   Nearly half of the respondents, 49 percent, said Dukakis should
remain in office during the presidential campaign while 40 percent
said he should resign and 11 percent had no definite opinion on the
question. Dukakis campaign aides have said repeatedly that he will
not resign before the election.
   ``People in Massachusetts are obviously disappointed in the way
their governor is running the state and they're taking it out on
him,'' said KRC pollster Gerry Chervinsky.
   While Republicans delighted in the results, Dukakis partisans
said they viewed the numbers more as a referendum on his handling
of recent state troubles than a fair assessment of his strength
against Bush in the presidential contest.
   Corrigan said Dukakis' state operation has just begun its
grass-roots organizing, an effort being led by many of those who
helped Dukakis win nearly 70 percent of the vote in his 1986
re-election bid. ``I'm not worried one bit,'' he said.
   ``Momma said there'd be days like this,'' said Goldman. ``Any
attempt to take this and make a relation between how November is
going to come out is ridiculous. But it is a nice way of sending
the message to dad that he better as hell spend some time looking
at the kid back home.''

   All 21 people aboard a twin-engine
commuter airplane were killed when it crashed in the mountains of
the western Sierra Madre range, rescuers at the scene said Thursday.
   Rain and clouds caused by Hurricane Kristy delayed the trek
through the rocky, heavily forested terrain.
   ``There are no survivors,'' said a federal aviation inspector in
Mexico City of Wednesday's crash. He was quoting officials at the
airport in the Pacific coast port of Lazaro Cardenas.
   The inspector, who asked that his name not be used, said the
plane carried 21 people _ three crew members and 18 passengers, not
17 as reported earlier in the day.
   Gen. Carmelo Teran, chief of staff of the 21st military zone,
said the wreckage and bodies were found within a radius of about 50
yards. He spoke by telephone from Morelia, capital of Michoacan
state.
   Aviation officials said the Brazilian-made Bandeirante aircraft
of the Aerofederal line disappeared after leaving Uruapan, 185
miles west of Mexico City, on the 100-mile flight to Lazaro
Cardenas.
   Aerofederal is a government-owned operation that carries cargo
and also serves regional passenger routes.
   Most of the passengers were from Uruapan. The crash site was
about 80 miles south of the city and near Arteaga, a town in
Michoacan about 210 miles southwest of Mexico City.
   A helicopter of the Federal Electricity Commission spotted the
wreckage at 9 p.m. Wednesday, but helicopters could not get into
the area again until late Thursday morning.
   Gen. Teran, who sent in a company of about 100 soldiers, said
the plane apparently crashed at the juncture of two mountains, La
Calera y El Fraile.
   ``Helicopters cannot land because of the forest,'' he said.
``They are clearing trees so they can land.''
   He said the site was three to four miles from the road and the
climb took between two and three hours.
   It is about 9 miles from Arteaga ``to where they leave the
vehicles, then they climb the hill,'' said Jesus Gutierrez, an
assistant to Arteaga's mayor. ``There are lots of rocks.''
   Francisco Javier Flores, city secretary of Lazaro Cardenas, said
Kristy lashed the area for two days and rain had fallen for about
four days.
   Adalberto Mandes, director of the Uruapan airport, said the
Lazaro Cardenas airport had no radar or communications facilities
that could have helped controllers track the plane.

<HEAD>Police Use Battering Ram and Stun Gun to Remove Armed 65-Year-Old
Woman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It took tear gas, a SWAT team, a battering
ram and a electric stun gun Thursday to remove a 65-year-old woman
from her home, where she had been holed up for three days, shooting
at police and slightly wounding the chief's brother.
   ``I think they had to do this because the old lady had a gun.
It's terrible,'' said neighbor Bang Lee, looking at a gaping hole
left in the neat house by the battering ram.
   The woman, Barbara Maxson, had lived in the house on the city's
south side for more than 20 years. She barricaded herself inside
Monday afternoon after arguing with her daughter.
   She began shooting when officers entered her house about 4 a.m.
Thursday after firing tear gas inside, said police spokesman Lt.
Fred Nixon.
   She was found in a bathtub, clutching a pistol and holding a
blanket over her head to block the tear gas fumes, Nixon said.
   Officers shot her with a Taser stun gun, which shoots a dart
that emits an electrical charge, temporarily disabling the person,
Nixon said. She was taken to Torrance Memorial Medical Center for
psychiatric observation, he said.
   The brother of Police Chief Daryl Gates, Capt. Stephen Gates,
was treated at another hospital after a bullet grazed his head as
he approached the house Wednesday to talk to Mrs. Maxson, Nixon
said.
   ``It does underscore that when someone is armed and decides for
whatever reasons to make an armed stand, their age and sex doesn't
matter. Whatever makes them dangerous is their escape from reality
or their disregard for human life,'' said Cmdr. William Booth, the
chief's spokesman.
   The standoff began Monday when the woman's daughter tried to
coax Mrs. Maxson, who reportedly had a history of psychiatric
problems, from the house for psychiatric care, Nixon and neighbors
said.
   Mrs. Maxson allegedly pointed a gun at her daughter, who called
police. Police watched the house, then decided to take action
Wednesday after being warned by Mrs. Maxson's husband that there
were several weapons inside.
   The police department's special weapons and tactics team was
called in, then the department's armored car equipped with a
battering ram, which is usually used against the heavily fortified
homes of drug dealers.
   ``We used the ram because the house had fortified bars on the
window and furniture piled in front of the windows. There was no
other safe way for our officers to make safe entry,'' Nixon said.
   The woman fired at the battering ram, he said.
   The ram damaged the front of the green-and-brown, one-story
house, strewing a refrigerator and household items in the driveway.

<HEAD>Janitor Collects Thousands of Can Tabs, But All In Vain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sam Arvin gathered thousands of pull
tabs from aluminum cans to help people suffering from kidney
failure, only to learn what other would-be do-gooders have learned
before: that the tabs are worthless.
   The 53-year-old janitor broke the tabs from countless aluminum
cans and persuaded about 100 colleagues at the auto plant where he
works to do the same. He even went to Texas to get the tabs from
4,000 aluminum cans in a nephew's collection.
   He believed the tabs could be cashed in for time on a dialysis
machine for patients with kidney failure, but when he tried to
redeem them, officials of Bethany Medical Center and the National
Kidney Foundation told that no such program existed.
   ``I really wanted to help these unfortunate people,'' he said.
``I wanted to take pictures of the patients and publish them in our
company newspaper to get more people interested.
   ``But then I learned that the tabs weren't going where I thought
they were going,'' he said. ``I could have had 500 people saving
those tabs. Now I'm left wondering what to do next.''
   The stories that aluminum tabs can buy a kidney patient some
time on a dialysis machine ``are completely untrue,'' Gigi
Poliposki, communications director for the National Kidney
Foundation in New York, told The Kansas City Times. ``Hundreds of
thousands of tabs have been collected by people, and our chapters
nationwide receive hundreds of calls every day from people
wondering how they can use them to help patients.''
   ``We have tried to trace the source of the rumors but with
absolutely no luck,'' she said.
   Ms. Poliposki said bogus or misguided information about the
``tab program'' had been very specific, with posters appearing in
libraries, school classrooms and buildings where civic groups meet.
   In response to the hoax, the National Kidney Foundation and the
Reynolds Aluminum Recycling Co. have started a program called
``Keep Tabs on Your Cans.''
   Under the program, people can take aluminum cans, pie plates,
foil, frozen dinner trays or other aluminum products to a Reynolds
recycling center and request that payment go to the kidney
foundation. A company spokesman said that 38 cents was being paid
for each pound of aluminum, although that price is subject to
change.

<HEAD>Israeli Official: PLO Is Palestinians' National Organization</HEAD>

   A senior Foreign Ministry official said
Thursday that Israel should accept that the Palestine Liberation
Organization represents the Palestinian people, prompting calls by
right-wing politicians for his resignation.
   Despite his colleague's comments, a Foreign Ministry spokesman
said the government still refuses to have any contact with the PLO,
which it regards as a terrorist organization.
   Avraham Tamir, director-general of the Foreign Ministry, also
suggested Israel should negotiate with PLO-backed Palestinians in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I certainly stress that for the Palestinians this (the PLO) is
their movement, and it should be accepted as a fact,'' said Tamir,
speaking from Washington in an interview with Israel radio.
   Tamir, a senior Israeli diplomat, helped negotiate Israel's 1979
peace accord with Egypt.
   The radio quoted Tamir as saying that for the Palestinians,
there can be no substitute for the PLO.
   Tamir said rifts within the PLO will probably prevent it from
recognizing Israel and renouncing terror, two of the conditions
imposed by the United States for accepting the PLO as a partner in
the peace process.
   However, Tamir said, the PLO should give its blessing to direct
talks between Israel and Palestinian representatives from the
occupied territories.
   The PLO should ``not prevent local leaders in the territories
from discussing with us interim arrangements that will quiet down
the situation and pave way for (political) process,'' Tamir said.
   His remarks created a storm of controversy. The right-wing Likud
bloc led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir demanded that Tamir be
immediately returned from Washington.
   Tamir is in the United States to prepare a visit of Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres later this month.
   ``No doubt, he has seriously violated the government's policy,''
said Shamir aide Yossi Ahimeir. ``We expect his superiors or
superior (Peres) to take action.''
   Ahimeir emphasized that Tamir did not speak on behalf of the
Israeli government, adding: ``There's a wide consensus in the
government and the public that there should be no negotiations with
this terror group.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said in a statement that
Israel has not changed its standing policy.
   ``Our position has been and will remain that as long as the PLO
does not recognize Israel, accept the U.N. resolutions 242 and 338
and stop terror, we shall continue to see it as a terrorist group
with which there should be no contact whatsoever,'' it said.
   The U.N. Security Council resolutions assert Israel's right to
exist within secure borders.
   Peres, leader of the left-wing Labor party, declined comment on
Tamir's statement.
   ``I'm not sure he has said it. We have to check what he said
exactly, and then we shall pass judgment,'' Peres said.
   Yuval Neeman, leader of the right-wing Tehiya Party, said
through a spokesman that Tamir should resign immediately.
   In another development, the accidental shooting of two Israeli
soldiers by a U.S.-born Jewish settler fueled a stormy debate
Thursday over the use of force by Israeli civilians in the occupied
territories.
   Left-wing legislator Ran Cohen blamed Shamir in part for the
shooting, saying the prime minister's calls for less restrictive
open-fire orders set the stage for settler vigilante acts.
   But Ronni Milo of the Likud bloc lashed out at the critics. They
are ``ready to abandon Jews to stones, firebombs and pogroms,'' the
daily Yediot Ahronot quoted Milo as saying.
   The shooting occurred Wednesday night near the West Bank
settlement of Efrat south of Jerusalem after a firebomb exploded
about 20 yards from the car of settler Gedalia Becker.
   Becker fired 11 shots from his pistol and struck two soldiers
who were also chasing the firebomb thrower. One soldier was wounded
in the stomach and lost a kidney, Israel radio said. The second
soldier was wounded in the leg.
   Becker was questioned by police and released on bail, but police
confiscated his weapon.
   On Tuesday, Shamir told settlers he supported a change in policy
to permit civilians and soldiers to open fire on Arab
stone-throwers without shooting warning rounds first.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _ About 110,000 students in the Gaza Strip returned to school
after their summer vacation, and leaflets distributed by the Moslem
fundamentalist group Islamic Jihad urged them not to stage
anti-Israeli demonstrations during class hours.
   Military government officals ordered schools in the West Bank to
remain closed for at least another month, saying they have been the
focus of anti-Israeli violence.
   _ Three Supreme Court judges toured the Ketziot detention camp
in the southern Negev Desert where 2,700 Palestinians are being
held, most of them for up to six months without charges. The visit
followed complaints by 17 detainees about prison conditions, such
as lack of water and exposure to the hot desert sun.
   _ Hundreds of Palestinian women demonstrated at the Red Cross
building in Gaza City to protest conditions at Ketziot. ``They took
my son away 75 days ago, and I don't know whether he is alive or
dead,'' said Mudheya Fauzi, the mother of a detainee. ``I am
begging authorities to close this prison.''

<HEAD>Shortage of Family Doctors Looming, American Medical Association
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States may be headed for a shortage of
family doctors unless they receive more respect and larger incomes,
the American Medical Association says.
   ``Between 1975 and 1986, the overall active physician population
increased by almost 45 percent. In contrast, the active family
physician population, including general practitioners, grew by only
24 percent,'' the AMA said.
   By the year 2000, the total physician population will rise by 22
percent, while the number of family physicians will increase by
only 9 percent, the association predicted in Friday's issue of the
Journal of the AMA.
   Family practice may be less prestigious than other specialties
because it stresses breadth rather than depth, lacks emphasis on
research and publication, and is unrecognized by the public as a
bona fide specialty, the AMA said.
   Family practitioners, the second-largest group of doctors behind
specialists in internal medicine, also make considerably less money
than their colleagues, the AMA said. Mean net income in 1986 for
family practitioners after expenses and before taxes was $80,300,
compared with $119,500 for physicians overall, it said.
   Part of the problem is that the Medicare program and insurance
companies typically reimburse doctors more for high-tech procedures
than for the time-intensive diagnosis, counseling and consulting
that are the hallmarks of family practice, the AMA report said.
   Yet ``demand for family physicians at hospitals is nationwide,''
the AMA said, citing a recent survey that found greatest demand in
the Midwest, where 40 percent of all responding hospitals reported
a need for family specialists.
   Family practitioners see more patients each week _ 139.2
compared with 117.7 for physicians overall in 1986 _ and work more
weeks each year _ 48.3 compared with 47.5 for physicians overall,
the AMA said.
   And patients of family practitioners wait only about 2.7 days to
be scheduled for an appointment, compared with a wait of 6.2 days
for physicians overall, the report said.
   It has been almost two decades since the American Board of
Family Practice set training and certification requirements for
family practitioners and mandated that certified members pass new
tests every six years, the AMA said.
   The board defined family practice as providing ``continuing,
comprehensive health maintenance and medical care to the entire
family regardlesss of sex, age or type of problem, be it
biological, behavioral or social.''
   The number of approved medical residency programs for family
practice has declined slightly, from 388 in 1983 to 381 in 1986,
and the specialty still struggles for recognition, the AMA said.
   It called for doctors to promote the image of the family
practitioner, work for fairer reimbursement from third-party
payers, and ensure family-practice residency programs are of the
highest quality.
   ``There may be a shortage of family physicians, despite a
predicted over-supply of physicians in general,'' the AMA said.
   Shortages of family doctors may occur particularly in rural
areas and settings such as health maintenance organizations, where
case managers with a broad range of expertise are needed, said the
AMA report.

   Burglars ransacked the home of 6-year-old
AIDS victim Eliana Martinez and stole about $1,800 worth of
possessions, including a medical device used to treat the deadly
disease, police say.
   Health officials say there is a slight chance that anyone
handling the stolen intravenous pump could become infected with
AIDS if residue blood in the device comes in contact with an open
cut.
   The robbery, believed to have occurred either Monday or Tuesday,
probably was not related to the publicity surrounding Rosa
Martinez's legal fight to get her daughter into public school
classes, said police spokesman Steve Cole.
   Mrs. Martinez is appealing a ruling last month by U.S. District
Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich that allows Eliana to attend a public
school only if she remains inside a specially built glass booth.
   The family also lost a color television, a videocassette
recorder, two calculators and a lawn mower in the burglary.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ A bomb exploded Thursday
evening in a downtown hotel patronized by blacks and set it ablaze,
killing two people and wounding 15, police reported.
   A mine exploded 90 minutes later on a railroad line about a mile
from the three-story hotel, slightly wounding two more people, said
officials at the Windhoek State Hospital.
   The explosions occurred on the day the South-West Africa
People's Organization said it would begin a voluntary cease-fire.
SWAPO has fought a long guerrilla war against South African control
of the territory, also known as Namibia.
   South Africa's government-run broadcasting network said an
anonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility for the hotel
bombing on behalf of SWAPO. The guerrilla group normally attacks
military targets or white residential or shopping areas.
   Louis Pienaar, the territorial administrator appointed by South
Africa, blamed SWAPO and accused it of violating the pledge of a
truce. He did not explain why the guerrillas would bomb a hotel
patronized by blacks.
   SWAPO and other black groups have warned of a possible white
backlash in Namibia because of preliminary South African proposals
for independence elections that probably would result in government
by the black majority.
   The Continental Hotel was severely damaged by the explosion at
about 7 p.m. Witnesses said several parked cars were hurled across
the street.
   Firefighters needed more than 90 minutes to bring the blaze
under control, The explosion apparently occurred near the hotel
entrance, witnesses said.
   Police spokesman Kerri du Rand said officials feared the
building could collapse. He said one black man and one white man
were killed, but he did not comment on the races of those injured.
   A correspondent for the South African Broadcasting Corp. at the
scene said the bombing was ``one of the biggest explosions Windhoek
has experienced.''
   SWAPO has said its guerrillas would stop launching attacks in
the territory as of Thursday as their contribution to a regional
peace initiative.
   South African commanders have not formally endorsed the truce
but have said their forces will not initiate offensive action
against SWAPO.
   SWAPO has been fighting since 1966 in a bid to win independence
for South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   On Tuesday, South Africa said it has pulled all its troops out
of Angola, where it was fighting alongside rebels in their battle
against Angola's Marxist government and its Cuban allies. South
Africa, Cuba and Angola had been observing a cease-fire in Angola
since Aug. 8.
   SWAPO was not included in peace talks involving those three
countries and U.S. mediators, and is not bound by any of the
agreements they have reached.
   The South African military reported Tuesday it had killed 14
SWAPO insurgents the previous week and that the guerrilla groups
had launched several sabotage attacks. But the military said there
were no new attacks reported Thursday.
   The South African military has said it expects Angola to use its
influence to keep SWAPO rebels at least 150 miles north of the
Namibian border. SWAPO has not said publicly if it will abide.
   SWAPO has its main bases in southern Angola, from which it
launches attacks into northern Namibia.
   South Africa has administered Namibia for 73 years, despite
repeated United Nations resolutions since 1966 calling for
independence in the territory.
   South Africa says it will begin withdrawing from Namibia on Nov.
1 and allow the territory to hold independence elections June 1 if
Cuba pulls its 50,000 troops out of Angola by the latter date.
   Several rounds of peace talks have failed to achieve a mutually
acceptable date for Namibian independence and the complete Cuban
withdrawal from Angola. More talks are planned Monday in
Brazzaville, Congo.

   NATO kept its jets out of West
German skies Thursday in memory of victims of the Ramstein air show
disaster, and an expert on treating burns said the quality of
rescue work had been ``a scandal.''
   West German officials gave the first breakdown by nationality of
the dead and injured in the fiery tragedy Sunday, when three
Italian air force jets collided and one crashed into the crowd at
the Ramstein U.S. Air Force base.
   The Bild newspaper reported that some children who died had
``such bad burns their parents couldn't even recognize them. That
happened to a boy of about 13, who died in Offenbach with his face
burned beyond recognition.''
   A badly burned man died early Thursday, raising the death count
to 49, said Juergen Dietzen, spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate
state where Ramstein is located. He said the U.S. Air Force count
of 52 dead was ``incorrect.''
   He said 40 of the dead had been identified: 33 West Germans, two
Americans, a Dutch citizen and one from France, and the three
Italian pilots involved in the collision. He did not release any
names.
   A U.S. Air Force statement Thursday said the 9-year-old son of
an American woman who died in the tragedy also had been killed.
   It identified him as Joshua Frymyer, ``the son of Pfc. Genevieve
Riggs who also died in the accident. The child is survived by his
father, Michael D. Frymyer of Lewistown, Pa.'' The Air Force
reported the death of Mrs. Riggs, 36, on Wednesday.
   She and her husband, Sgt. Myron Riggs, were with the U.S. Army's
110th Military Police Company in Pirmasens, West Germany. Sgt.
Riggs was among the injured and has been returned to the United
States for treatment.
   Dietzen also said four of the injured had not been identified
because they were in hospitals ``unable to communicate due to the
severity of their injuries'' and 168 other people still were
hospitalized.
   His breakdown of the 168 was 144 Germans, 16 Americans, two
Britons and one each from France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Africa
and the Philippines. He did not name the African country.
   A leading West German expert on burns said emergency crews
delivered many victims to hospitals incapable of treating serious
fire wounds.
   ``The organizational handling of the catastrophe ... was a
scandal and an unbelievable failure of those responsible,'' said
Leo Koslowski, former director of the Tuebingen University Surgical
Clinic. He spoke to reporters in Stuttgart.
   ``I find it unimaginable that none of the victims were
immediately brought to the highly modernized treatment centers in
Aachen and Berlin,'' he said.
   Wolfgang Herbig, director of the Kaiserslautern hospital where
many victims were taken, said a day earlier he felt there were not
enough ``mobile medical teams'' available at the air show.
   Rhineland-Palatinate officials have defended the rescue efforts
and praised the cooperation between Americans and Germans.
   Hesse state radio said several people had filed criminal
complaints with local prosecutors against Defense Minister Rupert
Scholz and the air show organizers for alleged negligent
manslaughter, according to Hesse state radio.
   Offices that process financial claims for damages against NATO
forces have added personnel to deal with an expected surge, the ZDF
television network said.
   In Rome, the Italian air force said Thursday the aerobatic team
that performed at the Ramstein air show will participate only at
military ceremonies in the immediate future.
   The air force also said in a statement that the participation of
the team known as the ``Frecce Tricolori'' (Tri-color Arrows) would
be limited to traditional flyovers with the planes trailing
tri-colored smoke.

   New York doctors soon will be able to tell
needle-sharing or sexual partners of AIDS-infected people that
they're in danger of contracting the fatal disease, under a bill
signed Thursday by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The measure gives doctors legal immunity if they act in good
faith when informing people they are at risk of getting the HIV
virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The law
stipulates that doctors can't tell people the name of the
AIDS-infected person, only that someone close to them has
contracted the disease.
   The law gives doctors, or the public health officials they wish
to designate, the option of informing people of the AIDS danger; it
doesn't require them to do so.
   Current state law offers legal immunity to doctors who inform
people when they are at risk of getting certain other sexually
transmitted diseases.
   The new law requires written consent before testing for the HIV
virus is done. Counseling must also be given before and after the
test.
   The law, which goes into effect Feb. 1, 1989, restricts the
disclosure of AIDS test results, including by court order or when
the test subject authorizes release of the information.
   Cuomo said the law would increase the number of AIDS tests in
New York.
   ``We're trying to get people to come forward willingly and allow
themselves to be tested, submit themselves to counseling and to the
help that we have to offer them,'' Cuomo said.
   New York, with more than 16,000 confirmed cases, has the
nation's highest incidence of AIDS. The state Health Department
estimates that about 46,000 New Yorkers will have contracted AIDS
by 1991.
   AIDS is transmitted through sexual contact, needles shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products and from pregnant
women to their offspring. There is no cure for the disease, which
damages the body's immune system.
   David Hansel, legal services director of the New York City-based
Gay Men's Health Crisis, said the bill,``recognizes that the key to
stemming the spread of the (HIV) virus is to encourage individuals
at risk to be counseled and tested.''
   The maximum penalty for improperly disclosing test information
is a year in jail and a $5,000 fine.

   Floridians snatched up Lotto jackpot
tickets Thursday, the day after officials upped the pot to $52
million, a world record for lotteries where the winner can take all.
   By noon, Thursday's ticket sales topped 2 million, a 51.8
percent increase over the 1.3 million tickets sold all day a week
earlier when residents were trying to win a $32 million jackpot.
   More than 13 million of the $1 tickets have been sold so far
this week, a 36.7 percent increase over the 9.6 million sold by the
same time last week.
   Since no one picked the six numbers drawn Saturday, the $32
million prize, which included the grand prizes of the two previous
weeks, was rolled over to be included in this week's jackpot.
   No one has won the grand prize in the weekly numbers game since
Aug. 6, when a Brandon woman won a $26 million jackpot.
   Lottery officials increased this week's jackpot from $50 million
to $52 million based on estimates that 40 million tickets would be
sold, according to Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul. Last week some
32 million tickets were sold.
   It took Florida only four months to break the world record for a
Lotto prize, which California set in June with a $51.4 million
prize that went to two people. California's biweekly numbers game
was 21 months old when it produced that jackpot.
   That had been the world record, according to Terri La Fleur, a
senior editor at Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, a monthly
trade publication based in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur. Spain's El Gordo lottery
registered a $56 million jackpot in 1983, but Valenza said Spain's
lottery was very different from Florida's Lotto game.
   In Spain's lottery, players don't choose their numbers, which
are already printed on tickets. Also, several winning entries are
guaranteed in each of the five or six drawings held each year.

   Shipyard and steel workers ended strikes
Thursday, and Lech Walesa urged others to halt Poland's worst labor
turmoil in seven years now that the government has agreed to
discuss Solidarity's future.
   A Solidarity spokesman said the walkout at the July Manifesto
mine, where the nationwide strike wave began more than two weeks
ago, appeared to be nearing an end.
   But by Thursday night, Walesa failed to convince striking bus
and dock workers in the Baltic port of Szczecin to end their
strike, and the strike committee decided to press for settlement of
their local issues, said the spokesman, Arkadiusz Rybicki.
   Walesa met with ranking officials Wednesday for the first time
in six years and the government agreed to discuss the outlawed
union and other issues. Restoring Solidarity's legal status was the
main demand of the strikers.
   Workers at the Stalowa Wola steel mill in southern Poland began
leaving the plant at 7 p.m. after receiving a telephone appeal from
Walesa and a message from the Roman Catholic episcopate, a strike
committee spokeswoman said.
   At least 3,000 strikers were in the Lenin shipyard, where Walesa
works as an electrician, including workers from other yards in this
Baltic port. They hoisted Solidarity banners as members of their
strike committee led them out.
   About 2,000 onlookers chanted, ``Thank you, thank you!'' and
``There is no freedom without Solidarity!'' Strikers and the crowd
outside joined in singing the national anthem just before the
shipyard gates swung open.
   More people lined the route to St. Brygida's Church, a
headquarters of sorts for the men of the shipyard where Walesa led
a strike eight years ago that gave birth to Solidarity.
   Poland's communist authorities recognized Solidarity in an
agreement signed Aug. 31, 1980, but declared martial law in
December 1981 to suppress the first independent union in the Soviet
bloc and outlawed it the following year.
   In the packed church, the Rev. Henryk Jankowski declared:
   ``In your wisdom which you showed today you decided about
suspending the protest, but it is only the end of the physical
protest. The strike goes on through dialogue.''
   Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski conducted the Mass, and said at its
outset: ``I thank you for your wisdom, you sons of a 1,000-year-old
nation which has always been connected with the church.''
   Shipyard workers gave up their strike in response to an appeal
by Walesa, who said an end to the labor turmoil would will open the
way for talks the government promised. The strikes began Aug. 16
and at their height idled 20 sites employing 100,000 people.
   One group of Gdansk port workers complained of bad faith by
authorities. They said they were told not to return to their jobs
because they had been fired for striking, said Antoni Graberczyk, a
member of the Gdansk port strike committee.
   He said the men would rally outside the port Friday to protest
the action.
   A statement from government spokesman Jerzy Urban said of
Walesa's efforts to end the strikes:
   ``We appreciate any positive and reasonable step. The appeal to
stop the strike is such a step. It should be especially valued when
it comes from a participant in the strikes.''
   On Wednesday, Walesa met in Warsaw with Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak and Stanislaw Ciosek, an alternate member of the
Politburo.
   In a statement afterward, he said he raised the issues of union
pluralism and Solidarity's role. Authorities promised talks on
those points and on broad economic and political issues, he said.
   Walesa toured the Lenin shipyard, other striking shipyards and
the Gdansk docks Thursday morning and won the agreement to end the
strikes.
   He spent the afternoon on the telephone with striking dock
workers in Szczecin, the steel mill employees in Stalowa Wola and
coal miners at the July Manifesto mine in the Silesian town of
Jastrzebie in southwestern Poland.
   ``At present Walesa has the extremely important task of being in
constant telephone communication with the centers still on strike.
It's a difficult matter,'' said Jacek Merkel, chairman of the
Gdansk Interfactory Strike Committee and an aide to Walesa.
   At the July Manifesto mine, management laid in a special
telephone line so Walesa could consult with the strikers who are
advised by Gdansk Solidarity activist Bogdan Lis, said Rybicki.
   ``Bogdan Lis assured Walesa that the miners would end the strike
soon,'' the Solidarity spokesman said.
   Earlier in the day, miners refused to take a call from Walesa in
the management office which is outside the mine gate, fearing it
was a trick to get them to leave the mine.
   Piotr Niemczyk, a Solidarity spokesman in Warsaw, said strikers
at the mine were demanding that Walesa make his appeal in person.
The miners also want issues of higher pay and better working
conditions settled.
   Urban's statement also said a policeman at the Stalowa Wola mill
died while on duty Wednesday night, but the circumstances were not
clear.
   ``It is not known if he was murdered or committed suicide under
psychological terror or persecution,'' the statement said. ``I am
awaiting results of the investigation.''
   Niemczyk said strikers at Stalowa Wola reported that a policeman
shot and killed himself but no details were available.
   Bishop Jerzy Dabrowski sent a telegram to the mill workers
saying the church had undertaken discussions with authorities to
guarantee ``personal and employee safety.''

   A power failure blacked out Athens and most of
southern Greece on Thursday night, snarling traffic in the capital
and knocking out radio and television.
   However, power was restored to parts of Athens later in the
evening.
   Industry Ministry officials said the failure was caused by an
explosion in a switch at an electricity substation near the
northern town of Larissa. The cause was not immediately known.
   The damaged switch knocked out power to three of the four cables
serving the area south of Larissa.
   The power was restored by later in the evening to outlying
districts of Athens and some areas of the city center.
   Police said there were no immediate reports of looting.
   Public Power Co. officials said it would be hours before the
power was completely restored.
   State-run radio and television went off the air at first.
However, the radio returned to the air 40 minutes later and urged
Athenians to remain calm.
   Police earlier said an undetermined number of people were
stranded on the city's subway line. However, a spokesman for the
system said later that it operates on a different power grid and
was not affected by the blackout.
   There was no immediate word on how many people might have been
trapped in elevators by the blackout, which occurred as many
Athenians were going home for dinner.
   Traffic lights in Athens were knocked out, causing huge traffic
jams in the city of 3.5 million people.
   The Athens airport operated normally throughout the blackout.
   A doctor said the city's hospitals were operating on backup
generators.

<HEAD>Democrats React Quickly To Hatch's `Homosexual' Quote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch said Thursday he never
intended to brand all Democrats as homosexuals in comments made the
previous day, but Democrats quickly pounced on the Utah
Republican's remarks as unbelievable and insulting.
   Hatch, in an extemporaneous speech Wednesday during a GOP
fund-raiser in southern Utah, referred to Democrats as ``the party
of homosexuals,'' and initially denied making the comment until a
tape of the speech was replayed for him.
   ``I would never say that deliberately, let's put it that way,''
he then said at a news conference. ``If that was said, that was a
mistake.''
   Hatch said he had intended to point out that the national
Democratic Party caters to homosexual activists, pro-abortionists,
gun-control groups, opponents of school prayer ``and almost every
other liberal, radical group in this country.''
   Brian Moss, Hatch's Democratic opponent for the Senate seat,
sharply criticized the remark during a speech to the Utah AFL-CIO's
state convention Thursday, then issued a news release that termed
the remark ``childish namecalling.''
   In an interview, Moss said Hatch's worst offense was to
initially deny having made the statement.
   ``What's more disturbing is that he tried to deny it until they
had it on tape,'' Moss said. ``That's got to say something about
the veracity of the man.''
   State Democratic Chairman Randy Horiuchi said Thursday he was
``disappointed'' by Hatch's remarks.
   ``I had respect for Senator Hatch as our United States
senator,'' he said. ``It's just unbelievable that he would say this
sort of thing.''
   A tape of Hatch's remarks made by radio station KDXU in St.
George showed Hatch called the Democratic Party the ``party of big
government, anti-defense, continual failure to support freedom
fighters all over the world, weak foreign policy _ really a
denigration of the Monroe Doctrine if you look at what they've been
doing to Reagan over these last eight years.
   ``And of course they love _ they are the party of homosexuals,
they are the party of abortion, they're the party that has fought
school prayer every step of the way,'' Hatch said. ``They're the
party that has basically, I think, denigrated a lot of the values
that have made this country the greatest country in the world.''
   Hatch said the remark was a small part of a much longer speech
that included many other issues.
   ``You can't take just one line out of a 25-minute speech and say
`this is what he meant,' when in fact it was clear I didn't mean
that,'' he said. ``They're taking one line out of context, if
that's accurate. I don't know that it is.''
   Campaign manager Bud Scruggs said on Thursday that the senator
was not denying that he made the statement, but was concerned that
it had been taken out of context.
   ``If he were making a formal statement, it would have been
worded more diplomatically,'' Scruggs said.
   Scruggs said the controversy would not harm Hatch's chances for
a third term. Hatch has led Moss by nearly 50 percent in recent
opinion polls.
   ``In Utah, I think most people are going to say that sounds kind
of undiplomatic, but it's true,'' Scruggs said.
   Meanwhile, Horiuchi called for an end to ``negative,
name-calling'' campaign tactics, saying he was worried the voters
would become so disenchanted that they would simply refuse to vote
in November.

<HEAD>Controversial Church Opens Four-Day International Seminar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Church of Christ opened a four-day
seminar Thursday amid criticism from traditional Church of Christ
groups who contend the church uses mind control techniques and is
taking over other ministries.
   Al Baird, an elder in the Boston Church, blames the accusations
on a few disgruntled former members and jealousy from less
successful congregations. The Boston church has risen from a few
dozen members to more than 3,300 members in ministries as far away
as South Africa and Argentina over the last 10 years.
   ``And people are suspicious of anything growing as rapidly as we
are,'' Baird said. ``There must be something wrong with it, there
must be something mysterious about it. Nobody else is growing like
that, what are you guys doing? You must be controlling people.''
   The Churches of Christ comprise about 18,000 independent
congregations with a U.S. membership of more than 2 million. The
churches preach basic Bible teachings and consider baptism an
essential part of the salvation process.
   The 1988 World Missions Seminar is attracting about 9,000 Church
of Christ members and other Christians to workshops on ``God's
Eternal Plan'' and ``God's Secret Weapon'' and speeches from church
elders.
   ``People come and really get some in-depth teaching, a lot of
in-depth reports on what's going on around the world,'' said Baird.
``And it's a time that people make some new commitments in their
personal lives.''
   The controversy surrounding congregations related to the Boston
church stems from their high-profile recruiting techniques and
their practice of ``discipling,'' an intense one-on-one
relationship between a person in the congregation and a new convert.
   New church members are taught to submit to their ``discipler''
in personal as well as spiritual matters to learn the ways of the
church.
   Members have been barred from proselytizing on the campuses of
Boston University and Northeastern University in Boston because
students complained they were being harangued to join Bible study
groups.
   In Nashville, Tenn., the president of the Church of
Christ-affiliated David Lipscomb University last week denounced a
newly founded Boston Church of Christ offshoot in Nashville.
   Harold Hazelip, the school's president, warned students not to
join the new ministry, which he likened to a mind-controlling cult,
after church members began circulating pamphlets on the Lipscomb
campus.
   Baird denies that the church seeks to control minds, and
compares the ``discipling'' process to an internship or a
student-teacher relationship.
   ``The controversy basically is: Does anybody have the right to
tell you what to do?'' Baird said. ``Obviously no one has to do
anything. No one is ever asked to go against their conscience, no
one is ever asked to violate the Bible.''

<HEAD>Austerity Draws Protests from Powerful Left</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARLOS CISTERNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protest mushroomed Thursday against
austerity measures imposed by new President Rodrigo Borja to
correct what he called ``economic chaos'' caused by the previous
government.
   Bus and taxi drivers in the capital of Quito halted work,
forcing thousands to walk to their jobs, and Ecuador's most
powerful labor federation threatened a general strike.
   Borja, a moderate leftist who took office Aug. 10, put an
economic emergency package into effect Wednesday, doubling the
price of gasoline, devaluing currency 35.5 percent and tightening
exchange controls.
   He said harsh measures were required because former President
Leon Febres Cordero, a controversial conservative, tried to
sabotage the new government by lying about key economic statistics
and purposely running up a huge deficit.
   The government also announced an increase in the minimum monthly
wage of $42. But leftist labor leaders rejected it and demanded an
increase to $77.
   ``These measures are a hard strike against the poor. They are
criminal,'' said Edgar Ponce, spokesman for the communist-led
United Front of Laborers, said of the austerity program.
   Ponce said directors of the federation may set a date next week
for a general strike. During his four-year term, Febres Cordero
faced seven nationwide strikes, which affected the majority of
Ecuador's work force of more than three million.
   Febres Cordero, a political enemy of Borja, has denied
attempting to derail the new government. Borja won the presidency
in May, defeating populist candidate Abdala Bucaram. Cordero was
not eligible to run for re-election.
   Febres Cordero said on leaving office that the 1986 collapse of
world prices for oil, Ecuador's principal export, and a devastating
earthquake a year later pitched the nation into the ``crisis of the
century.''
   Borja said the previous government spurred inflation, expected
to hit 60 percent this year, compared to 32.7 percent in 1987, by
deliberately running a spending deficit of 16 percent. He said
accurate figures on the growing $11 billion foreign debt and
declining dollar reserves were deliberately withheld.
   ``With an emergency economic program we hope to bring these
grave disorders under control within 12 months,'' Borja said in an
official communique.
   The devaluation affects the official exchange rate, which went
from 250 sucres to 390 sucres to the dollar.

   Republican nominee George Bush showered Michael
Dukakis with scorn in the governor's polluted home port Thursday,
accusing his Democratic rival of ``hiding his secret record'' of
anti-environmental actions.
   On a ferry tour of Boston Harbor, which has become a major
environmental embarassment to Massachusetts, Bush noted that this
was where American revolutionaries dumped tea to protest British
taxes.
   `If tea were spilled in the Boston Harbor today, it would
dissolve in the residue of my opponent's neglect and delay,` Bush
said aboard his chartered ferry, which was followed by a handful of
boats carrying chanting Dukakis supporters.
   Bush exclaimed ``fantastic'' when he was shown a copy of the
Boston Herald reporting the results of a new poll under a banner
headline reading: ``Shocker: Bush Ties Mike in Mass.'' The vice
president said he couldn't believe it.
   During the day, Bush harshly accused Dukakis of trying to avoid
ridding the harbor of sludge and sewage. The state is now beginning
its cleanup program under a federal court order.
   Bush said voters should know that ``the reason the Boston Harbor
is not cleaner today is that the Dukakis administration twice
sought to avoid making it cleaner.'' He said half a billion gallons
of ``barely treated sewage'' enter the harbor every day.
   The Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Boston releases
500 million gallons of sewage every day.
   ``My opponent's solution: delay, fight, anything but clean up.
Well, I don't call that leadership, and I certainly don't call that
competence,'' Bush said, invoking Dukakis' frequent argument that
competence is what voters want in the 1988 election.
   Bush said that in 1978 and in 1984, Dukakis as governor sought a
waiver of a federal Clean Water Act provision requiring secondary
treatment by all publicly owned treatment facilities.
   While Dukakis prepared the waiver request in 1978, it was his
successor, Gov. Edward J. King, who made the first request in 1979.
   Douglas Foy, an attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation
which sued Dukakis as governor in 1983 to clean up the harbor, said
it was the Environmental Protection Agency that took no action on
the waiver request for three years.
   Bush brushed aside a question about an EPA delay under the
Reagan administration of which he was part. He said he was focusing
on what he would do as president and on Dukakis' record.
   `The stealth candidate is at it again. Making promises on one
hand but hiding his secret record on the other,` Bush said.
   He said Dukakis had visited the waste-strewn beaches of New
Jersey and promised to end pollution there. ``What he didn't tell
them is this,'' Bush said. ``The Dukakis adminsitration had applied
in 1985 for a permit to dump Massachusetts sewage sludge off the
coast of New Jersey.''
   Massachusets asked the EPA in 1985 for temporary permission to
dump at a site 106 miles offshore where New York and New Jersey
already were dumping. A compromise arrangement allowed
Massachusetts to dump further out, beyond the continental shelf.
   Bush, pressing his effort to attract environment-minded voters,
campaigned later Thursday at the Maritime Center in Norwalk, Conn.,
where people are concerned about pollution of Long Island Sound.
   ``When it comes to preserving and protecting the environment,''
Bush told an audience at the center, ``I do consider myself a Teddy
Roosevelt Republican. We are not going to give away this
constituency to the Democrats.''
   Standing on the deck of the ferry boat as it passed Deer Island,
the future site of a sewage treatment plant near the mouth of Boson
Harbor, the vice president urged a ban on ocean dumping of sewage
sludge after 1991.
   He also called for more intensive Coast Guard efforts, with the
help of the FBI, to apprehend violators.
   Bobbing in the wake of Bush's ferry were several boats carrying
protesters waving pro-Dukakis campaign signs.
   One motorized raft carried a banner that read, ``Bush Loves
Toxic H2O.'' A sailboat had one reading ``Bush Loves Noriega,'' a
reference to Panama's military leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega, who has
been implicated in drug trafficking.
   On a larger boat, about 20 Dukakis suppoters chanted ``Where was
George?'' the Democrats' favorite rallying cry since their
nominating convention in Atlanta in July.
   Bush laughed and waved at the demonstrators, and called them
``pathetic.''
   ``Out of respect for my office, there ought to be more than
that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Says Pay Gap Between Declining, Emerging Industries Growing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The pay and benefits gap between workers in
declining industries such as steel and mining and growth businesses
like restaurants and health services has widened to more than
$10,000 a year in the 1980s, a study prepared for the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress said Thursday.
   Although such a shift in employment patterns has been occurring
since the end of World War II, its acceleration this decade has
created an ``unprecedented drag on pay growth,'' said the report
prepared by University of Massachusetts economist Robert Costrell.
   In the 1950s, pay and benefits for workers in expanding
industries averaged $6,133 a year below those in contracting
businesses, as measured in 1987 dollars. The gap narrowed to $647 a
year in the 1960s, widening slightly to $811 in the 1970s, the
report said.
   But this decade it has increased more than tenfold.
   In the 1981-87 period, during the Reagan administration, jobs in
expanding sectors of the economy paid an average of $21,983 a year
_ $19,154 in wages plus $2,829 in health, pension and other
benefits, including employer contributions to Social Security, the
report said.
   However, that is $10,404 a year below the average compensation
of workers in retreating industries, where the average wage was
$26,193 plus $6,194 in benefits, or a total of $32,387.
   Only part of the gap is due to difference in hourly wage rates,
about $3.08, according to the report.
   Another factor is that the jobs in manufacturing and other
retreating industries usually offered overtime opportunities with
an average workweek of 40.4 hours. Jobs in the expanding areas of
the economy had an average workweek of only 32.7 hours, the report
said.
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., said the
study reflects ``serious setbacks experienced by exporting and
import-competing industries in a prolonged period of policy
indifference.''
   Republicans were quick to criticize the report, with Sen.
William Roth, R-Del., calling it ``Creative Economic Analysis 101.''
   ``It should come as no surprise that, in this election season,
the author of this study is from Massachusetts, the home state of
the liberals' favorite presidential candidate,'' Democratic Gov.
Michael Dukakis, Roth said.
   ``By concentrating on 1981-87, Mr. Costrell includes the
recession year of 1982 during which unemployment rose dramatically
but excludes the gains in employment made thus far in 1988.''
   Costrell acknowledged that the report does not include data from
this year, with its strong rebound in manufacturing employment.
   But he said he found two turning points in labor market shifts
in the past: 1973 when energy prices jumped and 1981 when U.S.
trade deficits began emerging and energy prices started falling,
reversing the pattern of the 1970s.
   ``It's possible that analysis of this sort a few years hence
will discern another turning point around 1987 if recent trade
gains continue and energy prices start rising again,'' Costrell
said.
   He said the effect of jobs shifting more rapidly from
higher-paying to lower-paying industries this decade has ``retarded
the recovery of real wage growth from the slowdown of the '70s.''
   After adjustments for inflation, the average real compensation
of workers this decade has grown about one-half percent or an
average $126 annually, still ahead of increases averaging less than
$100 a year in the 1970s. But it would have grown a full percentage
point or about $239 per year had there been no shift in employment,
the report said.
   ``Much of this shift effect may represent the losses of the
younger generation who are unable to enter or move up to the jobs
of their retiring parents,'' Costrell said.
   Not all of the shifts have been negative. For example, the
report noted that the low-paying apparel and textile industry and
private household services contracted sharply this decade while
financial brokerage firms with high-paying jobs expanded rapidly,
at least up until the stock market crash last October.

<HEAD>Final Test Of Discovery Joints A Complete Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fifth and final test of seals and
joints on the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket went smoothly
Thursday, according to engineers at the Marshall Space Flight
Center.
   ``Based on all appearances the test was a complete success,''
said Jim Thomas, technical assistant to the manager of the solid
rocket motor project.
   The two-minute static test firing, with the booster segment
anchored in a $25 million test stand, put launch-style pressure on
joints redesigned after the Challenger disaster.
   ``This fifth test increases our confidence level and improves
our engineering understanding of the redesigned joints,'' Thomas
said. ``I believe the test data will show that we have a
reproducible and reliable design.''
   The seals are designed to keep internal hot gases inside the
twin rockets that help kick shuttles into orbit.
   The failure of a joint in one of Challenger's two boosters was
blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion that killed all seven crew
members.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to
launch the space shuttle Discovery from the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida by the last week of September. Marshall is responsible for
shuttle propulsion systems including the booster rockets.
   Thursday's test was the fifth time Marshall engineers have
pressurized and then examined the new joints. The four previous
tests all have shown the new designs properly seal joints even when
damaged.
   ``We've done four other tests, and that's all that was in the
program,'' said Marshall spokesman Jim Solley. ``But we had time to
do one more and wanted to get all the additional data we could.''
   The 548,000-pound booster segment was fired for six-tenths of a
second and then pressurized for 120 seconds.
   Booster maker Morton Thiokol Inc. test-fires full-scale boosters
in the Utah desert at its Wasatch Proving Grounds.

   George Bush, venturing into Michael Dukakis's backyard, accused
his opponent Thursday of fighting efforts to clean up dirty Boston
harbor. Dukakis attacked his rival's claims on education and asked
``Where was George?'' when school programs were being cut.
   ``He was playing hooky,'' Dukakis said, answering his own
question.
   The presidential candidates campaigned on opposite ends of the
country, each trying to take the offensive and demonstrate that
their fall campaign is near full swing well before the traditional
Labor Day kickoff.
   A day after declaring himself to be a life-long
environmentalist, the Republican nominee traveled to Massachusetts
and took a boat tour of the harbor _ an event aimed at making its
pollution problems an embarrassment for the governor.
   The vice president was encouraged by a new poll showing his race
with Dukakis deadlocked even in Dukakis' home state, where he has
won three terms as governor.
   ``Two hundred years ago tea was spilled in the Boston harbor in
the name of liberty,'' Bush said. ``If tea were spilled in the
Boston harbor today, it would dissolve in the residue of my
opponent's neglect and delay.''
   Dukakis, ridiculing Bush's claims to be an environmentalist,
said Bush was ``one of the charter members of the environmental
wrecking crew'' of the Reagan administration.
   He also charged Bush had told California voters he opposed
offshore oil drilling while telling Texas audiences he supported
it. Dukakis said his ``environmental policy doesn't change with the
time zones.''
   Bush's running mate Sen. Dan Quayle was on a week-long trip
through the South. In Little Rock, Ark., he said that despite his
wealth, ``I identify with people that need help.''
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen was on
vacation in Wyoming.
   In Boston, Bush contended that as governor Dukakis opposed and
delayed cleaning up the harbor and had sought permission from the
Environmental Protection Agency to delay a ban on dumping wastes in
the harbor.
   Dukakis drafted papers seeking the delay in his first term, but
it was his successor, Ed King, who actually filed the request in
1979.
   Bush said that in 1978 and in 1984, with Dukakis as governor,
Massachusetts sought federal waivers for meeting secondary sewage
treatment standards.
   ``He did not want to meet the clean water requirements,'' Bush
said.
   Dukakis campaigned at an Oakland public school gathering and
linked the vice president to education program cuts during the
Reagan administration. He ridiculed Bush's vow to be ``the
education president'' as an ``election-year strategy.''
   He said the Reagan administration eliminated remedial math and
reading programs for 500,000 poor children; cut college loans and
grant programs; and lectured teachers while cutting teacher
retraining programs.
   ``Where was George while all this was going on?'' Dukakis said.
``Where was the man who now says he wants to be the `education
president?' He was playing hooky. He was nowhere to be found.''
   Dukakis also attacked Bush on another front: the vice
president's proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax, which he
said would cost the country $40 billion in revenues over five years.
   He said those making over $200,000 a year could gain $30,000
from the cut, ``More than the average California teacher makes in a
year, enough to allow some families to send their children to
college in style.''
   Dukakis faced embarrassing poll results in his home state,
including a survey conducted for The Boston Herald that found
Dukakis and Bush tied in the state at 42 percent each. The poll of
400 likely voters conducted Wednesday had a 5-point margin of error.
   A poll for the Herald in July found Dukakis leading by 14
percentage points.
   Asked by reporters in California if he was was worried about
carrying his home state, Dukakis responded ``no.''
   Dayton Duncan, the Democratic nominee's press secretary, said
the campaign was confident that Dukakis will win Massachusetts and
added, ``We're also confident he will carry George Bush's other
home states _ Maine, Texas, Washington, D.C., and any others he
claims.''
   The debate over presidential debates remained unresolved as
campaign managers for the two candidates failed to agree on the
number of face-to-face encounters. Bush campaign manager James A.
Baker III is seeking two debates while Dukakis manager Paul
Brountas has asked for three debates.
   The only agreement between Brountas and Baker came on plans for
the two sides to talk to each other again by telephone on Tuesday.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson and some of his advisers on Thursday
tended to dismiss reports of tensions between his organization and
the Dukakis campaign.
   Interviewed on NBC's ``Today'' program, Jackson said ``I have no
knowledge'' of a list of states the Dukakis campaign reportedly
wants Jackson to avoid while campaigning on behalf of the
Democratic ticket. But he said such a list ``would not be a good
thing.''
   After a meeting in Atlanta with 70 party officials and campaign
workers, Jackson said, ``I will campaign for voter registration and
voter turnout in every state that I can get to.''
   ``In some instances we'll speak directly for, as a surrogate
for, the ticket,'' Jackson said, while elsewhere he will represent
the Democratic Party or his own ``rainbow coalition'' wing of the
party.
   ``I would hate to wake up on the morning of Nov. 9 (the day
after the election) and hate to think that we lost by the lack of
my work,'' he said.
   ``There are always problems during a campaign ... but I haven't
seen any evidence that a great divisiveness exists,'' said Jackson
adviser Bert Lance, former White House budget director under
President Carter.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China and the Soviet Union ended five days of
talks on the Cambodian conflict Friday but fell short of resolving
their differences, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The meeting marked the first time China, the chief backer of
anti-Vietnam resistance forces in Cambodia, and the Soviet Union,
the main supporter of Vietnam, have met specifically to discuss how
to bring an end to the 9-year-old conflict.
   The meeting also has been seen as a crucial step in normalizing
long-strained relations between Beijing and Moscow and paving the
way for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 29 years.
   On Thursday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said
the two sides ``stood for a fair and reasonable settlement to the
Kampuchean (Cambodian) question by political means and expressed
their willingness to do their best to promote the attainment of
this goal.
   ``The meeting also shows that the two sides find common ground
as well as differences,'' he said.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev and China's Deputy
Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei headed the delegations.
   Soviet officials were not immediately available for comment on
the talks.
   The brief Xinhua dispatch said little except to quote Tian as
saying the two sides had ``conducted candid discussions, done
useful work and found some common points during their working
meeting.''
   Jin, speaking at a weekly briefing, would not provide details of
the talks or the remaining differences.
   But he said the talks focused on ``how to urge Vietnam to pull
its troops out of Kampuchea as soon as possible.''
   Jin said the meeting ``enhanced mutual understanding and was
beneficial'' and ``we hope the meeting can be conducive to the
improvement of the relations between the two countries.'' But he
would not say whether it had improved the possibility for a
Chinese-Soviet summit.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has called for a summit to end
nearly three decades of enmity between the two countries, but China
insists that the Soviet Union must first persuade Vietnam to leave
Cambodia.
   One sign that sharp differences remain on the Cambodian question
was a strongly worded commentary by Xinhua which blasted Vietnam
for stepping up the ``Vietnamization'' of Cambodia and trying to
create a puppet government in Phnom Penh.
   The commentary, appearing in major dailies Thursday, charged
that Vietnam, which has pledged to withdraw 50,000 troops this
year, has ``put tens of thousands of its troops in the uniform of
the puppet forces'' of the Hanoi-backed Hun Sen government in Phnom
Penh.
   It said, ``the Phnom Penh regime's troops have expanded to
70,000 men within a year and the militia has grown to tens of
thousands, surpassing the total number of the three Kampuchean
resistance forces.''
   The news agency claimed that Vietnam has installed ``trusted
followers'' in the Hun Sen leadership and that there are now at
least 700,000 Vietnamese migrants in Cambodia.
   It repeated that China understands concerns that the
Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge, the most powerful resistance force,
will return to power but insisted that Hun Sen's domination of a
future government is ``a more acute danger.''
   The Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1978 killed hundreds of
thousands of people in an attempt to return Cambodia to a totally
agrarian society. Vietnam has linked its withdrawal to assurances
the Khmer Rouge will not be able to return to power.
   China says Vietnam's withdrawal must come first and supports a
four-party coalition headed by resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and including the Hun Sen forces, the Khmer Rouge,
Sihanouk's group and a third resistance faction.

<HEAD>Rain and More Rain for Large Sections of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell across large sections of the nation Thursday as a
slow-moving cold front brought showers and thunderstorms to the
upper Mississippi Valley and Colorado and showers moved eastward
from Kansas into Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.
   Rainfall of more than an inch was reported as the cold front
moved across western and central parts of Minnesota Thursday
morning.
   Showers traveled slowly from western into central Kansas and
extended across western Oklahoma into the Texas Panhandle. The
National Weather Service said Eva, Okla., in the Panhandle measured
over 3 inches of rain by Thursday morning. Amarillo, Texas, had 1{
inches in 24 hours.
   Winds became gusty along the front in Colorado, with northwest
winds reaching to near 50 mph at Colorado Springs.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued to be widespread along
coastal areas from the southern Atlantic region through the Gulf
Coast and across Florida. Over 1\ inches of rain was logged at
Apalachicola, Fla.
   Significant rainfall was also reported during the six hours
ending at 2 p.m. EDT at Gage, Okla., Charleston, S.C., Eau Claire,
Wis., Brunswick and Savannah, Ga., and Jacksonville, Fla.
   Temperatures were in the 70s and 80s across much of the nation.
Readings were in the 90s over northeast and south-central Texas and
over central Florida. Temperatures in the desert Southwest ranged
from the middle 90s to 105 degrees.
   The low in the nation early Thursday was 30 degrees at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Laramie, Wyo., to 110 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   For Friday, a cold front was forecast from the Great Lakes into
the central Plains scattering showers and thunderstorms from the
Great Lakes through the Ohio Valley into the middle Mississippi and
lower Missouri Valleys. Scattered showers were also expected from
the southern Atlantic coast through the Tennessee and lower
Mississippi valleys to the Gulf Coast and Florida. Showers and
thunderstorms were expected to be widespread over the southern high
Plains and from southern Mississippi through northern Georgia into
South Carolina.
   High temperatures in the 80s or 90s were predicted across much
of the nation. Highs were expected in the 70s from the northern
Plains through the upper Mississippi Valley and across much of
Maine. Highs between 100 and 110 degrees were forecast from the
desert Southwest into the valleys of California. Record-breaking
highs were anticipated from interior Oregon into southern
Washington state and the southern half of Idaho as temperatures
were expected to reach the mid 90s to near 105 degrees.

   Sen. Dan Quayle, saying ``I'm still
ticking,'' toured a Timex plant Thursday, courting the blue-collar
vote, and found himself defending his record on controversial
plant-closing legislation.
   In a day scheduled mostly as a series of photo opportunities,
the Republican vice presidential nominee shook hands with workers
at the watch plant, toured a day care center at a children's
hospital and then traveled to Mississippi to watch a high-school
football practice.
   At a news conference here, Quayle was asked about his opposition
to the plant-closing bill, which requires manufacturers with 100 or
more employees to give worker 60 days' notice before shutting the
facility. Quayle was a leading Senate opponent of the legislation,
which was supported by a substantial portion of the public,
according to polls.
   ``They should give notice,'' Quayle said. ``It ought to be much
more than 60 days.''
   But Quayle said he favored a voluntary plan, that would have
offered employers incentives to participate. As a matter of
principle, however, he said companies should go along with such a
program.
   ``Any CEO (chief executive officer) that doesn't give notice,
should be fired on the spot,'' Quayle said.
   The plant-closing legislation was cited by President Reagan as
the reason he vetoed a sweeping trade bill earlier this year. The
plant provision was then passed as a separate piece of legislation
that Reagan allowed to become law without his signature.
   Quayle said a legislative compromise that would have allowed
more flexibility in the bill had been agreed on by the principal
drafters of the bill, including Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle's
Democratic counterpart. But the compromise fell apart at the last
minute, Quayle said, suggesting that Bentsen was a major reason.
   ``He was part of it,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle said he was not concerned about people who say he is not
qualified to be president if the situation arose.
   ``We still have a long time in this campaign ... By Election Day
there will be no doubt.''
   Quayle toured a Timex plant, where he joked: ``Timex takes a
lickin' but keeps on ticking'. I know what John Cameron Swayze
meant.''
   ``I'm still ticking. I'm going to continue to talk about the
issues. It is an upbeat campaign,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle also toured the employee day care center at Arkansas
Children's Hospital, where he made made a pitch for George Bush's
approach to day care _ giving parents tax credits for day care but
without imposing stringent federal regulations on how day care
programs should be conducted.
   ``We don't need a massive federal bureaucracy to come in and
tell us how to run our day care,'' he said.
   Quayle was also asked about a forthcoming article in The New
Republic which said that a public relations firm run by Quayle's
campaign manager, Stuart Spencer, was paid $350,000 in 1984-85 to
lobbyist for Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   According to advance copies of the article, the firm lobbied
against drug investigations of Noriega and defended him against
allegations of killing former president, Dr. Hugo Spadafora, in
September 1985.
   Quayle said he did not ``know about the specifics'' of the
story. He said he only met the long-time Republican strategist when
Spencer came in to handle his campaign after work in both Reagan
presidential campaigns.
   ``From my observation, Stuart Spencer is a political pro,''
Quayle said.

<TEXT>
   President Miguel de la Madrid's final report
to the Mexican Congress was interrupted Thursday by opposition
shouts of ``Fraud,'' demonstrations in protest of the July
elections, and a tumultuous opposition walkout.
   The raucous scene, which included physical attacks on one
opposition leader, was unprecedented in the history of the Congress.
   In his 3{-hour speech, De la Madrid sought to sum up a six-year
administration that inherited massive economic problems and a
corrupt political system. He said it was a time of necessary
sacrifice that hurt Mexicans, but that his reforms prepared Mexico
for the 21st century.
   De la Madrid spoke to a breakdown of congressmen such as no
Mexican president has faced in the 60 years the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) has held power _ one where the opposition
has nearly half the seats. Even so, the opposition claims the PRI
maintained its grip only through massive cheating.
   Near the end of the speech, Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo led a
walkout by leftist Democratic Front delegates amid cries of
``Traitor!'' and ``Get out, Judas!'' from PRI delegates. Munoz
Ledo, who was once head of the PRI, was kicked in the back and hit
in the neck as he left.
   ``We are walking out in protest because they refused to let the
voice of the oppositon be heard,'' he said afterwards. De la
Madrid's speech was full of ``falsehoods and inaccuracies,'' he
said.
   Earlier in the speech, de la Madrid was interrupted for at least
five minutes by delegates chanting ``Fraud, fraud.'' Delegates of
the rightist National Action Party held up remains of what they
said were partly burned and void ballots.
   PRI deputies tried to shout down the opposition, clapping and
chanting ``Mexico, Mexico.''
   National Action members did not walk out, but leader Abel
Vincenio Tovar said the ruling party had packed the gallery. He
said spectators included a large military contingent.
   ``When the ruling party doesn't have the backing of the peopl,
they have to bring their own supporters,'' he said.
   After the walkout, de la Madrid departed from his text to call
for tolerance ``even in the face of insults by our political
adversaries.''
   A presidential aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
protests might be new but were ``normal in any parliamentary
system,'' and Manuel Camacho Solis, general secretary of the PRI,
praised what he viewed as de la Madrid's coolness under fire.
   ``We condemn the intentions and tyrannies of the small group
that wanted to impose its anti-democratic practices on the
majority,'' Camacho Solis said in a statement.
   There were also interruptions as de la Madrid spoke of his
economic policy, which reduced government control of the economy,
encouraged domestic and foreign investment and sharply reduced
inflation.
   But Mexicans paid the price with a drastic reduction in buying
power and lifestyle as petroleum prices and the Mexican currency
collapsed.
   The austerity was needed, de la Madrid said, becase ``we had to
face and accept the fact that we would have to live within our
means.''
   ``The crisis we have lived through shook the very foundations of
our social structure,'' de la Madrid said. ``It is was though we
had run the rapids in the current of history. It was rough, but we
also made considerable progress.''
   The new Congress was the result of the political reforms
sponsored by de la Madrid, and he lashed out at opposition parties
that have criticized the electoral process and accused his
administration of abetting electoral fraud.
   ``(Political) pluralism is a vital sign of democracy,'' he said.
``and should never be a symptom of a divided or splintered nation.''
   Negotiations between the PRI and the opposition had made it
possible only two days ago to install the new Congress in time for
the de la Madrid's sixth and final state of the nation message. The
PRI holds 260 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, to 139 for the
leftist Democratic Front and 101 for the rightist National Action
Party.
   The PRI's stranglehold on power has been so strong that until
this year no opposition candidate had ever been elected to the
Senate. Now four of 64 Senators belong to the leftist opposition.
   The same fractious Congress must, in the next two months,
certify the election of De la Madrid's chosen successor, Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
   Salinas, the PRI candidate, won barely more than 50 percent of
the popular vote. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the Democratic Front
candidate, took 31 percent in the official count, but claims he was
the actual winner.
   On other matters, de la Madrid said Mexico will continue its
fight against drug trafficking, and, in a clear reference to the
United States, added, ``we hope that everyone is doing their
part.'' Mexico, he said, cannot fight drugs successfully ``unless
the demand for drugs is combated in major centers of consumption.''
   De la Madrid said the problem of Mexico's foreign debt _ now at
$104 billion _ ``has not been resolved'' despite renegotiation and
the sale of Mexican government bonds.
   In a preview of what is expected to be Salinas' policy, de la
Madrid said Mexico must insist on ``greater joint responsibility
and understanding on the part of the creditors in order to achieve
a solution to the problem they helped to foster.''
   State-controlled Mexican television broadcast the entire speech,
illustrating passages with videotape. It at first showed protests
but no walkout, but the walkout itself was broadcast on later
programs.

   One day after Delta Flight 1141 crashed
on takeoff, the pilot of another Boeing 727 beginning the same
flight to Salt Lake City aborted takeoff because of an apparent
minor stall, officials said.
   Passengers, including six who had been among the survivors of
Wednesday's crash, were stunned when the captain brought the jet to
a halt and taxied it back to the terminal.
   ``We figured this would be the safest flight we could ever take
today,'' said passenger Louise Cox, of Baton Rouge, La., as she
waited to board another 727 for Salt Lake City. ``Evidently not.''
   In Portland, Ore., the pilot of a Delta Lockheed L-1011 aborted
takeoff Thursday at Portland International Airport after a faulty
cockpit warning light indicated an engine was overheating, an
airline spokesman said.
   The Texas flight, scheduled to depart at 8:31 a.m., finally left
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport more than two hours late.
The replacement plane landed at Salt Lake City without incident.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the type of problem that
apparently occurred Thursday would not have necesssarily forced a
pilot to abort the takeoff.
   The pilot, whose name was not released, was probably being extra
cautious because of the crash Wednesday that claimed 13 lives,
Berry said. Nealy 100 other passengers and crew members survived.
   Speaking from Delta's Atlanta headquarters, Berry said the pilot
believed his problem stemmed from ``what is called a compressor
stall. There was a crosswind blowing across the runway. That can
interrupt the smoothness of the airflow that goes into the engine,
creating a temporary loss of power.''
   Delta maintenance crews were unable to find anything wrong with
the aircraft, Berry said.
   Thursday's flight carried 102 passengers plus a crew of seven,
according to Delta spokesman Henry Conley in Dallas. Conley said
that to his knowledge, all on board the aborted flight got on the
replacement plane.
   Shaken passengers waiting to board that plane described their
experience.
   ``It was a routine takeoff until we got almost to the end of the
runway,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Don Burkhalter of Jackson,
Miss. ``Then we heard what sounded like bumps and the pilot
decelerated. He said there was a problem with the `compressors.'''
   ``The captain said, and this is a quote, `It's just one of those
things.' We just laughed.'' But it was nervous laughter, said
Burkhalter, who was on his way to California with his wife.
   Waiting to board Thursday's flight _ before it was aborted _ a
survivor of Wednesday's crash talked of the difficulty of getting
on Flight 1141 a day after it ended in tragedy.
   ``It's pretty hard,'' said Ronald Black, 30, of West Monroe, La.
``You've got to do it sometime. Can't live in Dallas.'' He said he
opted to continue his trip West because ``I've either got to go
home or go hunting. I've got to fly either way, so I might as well
go hunting.''
   Berry said that when the pilot decided to stop the takeoff as
the plane rolled down the runway, the plane had speeded up to
roughly 25 mph, ``which is extremely slow.''
   ``The airplanes get up to 100 knots (115 mph) before they become
airborne,'' he said. ``He did not get the proper readings from one
of his engines. He decided to go back to the gate.''
   Ordinarily, a pilot dealing with such a minor stall would
``simply increase thrust to see if everything continued to perform
right,'' Berry said. ``But based on the incident that happened
yesterday, the captain was extremely cautious and elected simply to
come back to the gate and let maintenance look at the engine.''
   He emphasized that pilots ``have got to go by their years of
experience'' and can abort flights ``if they don't like what they
feel, if they've just got a gut feeling.''
   The Delta jet in Portland, Ore., never left the runway and
braked to a stop. There were no injuries among the 190 passengers
and crew on board, said David Zielke, Delta's Portland district
marketing manager.
   Mechanics in Portland inspected the L-1011's engines and
determined they had not overheated and that the warning light was
faulty. Flight 51 originated in Atlanta and was en route to Tokyo.
   Also Thursday, in Orlando, Fla., an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727
en route to Philadelphia turned back shortly after takeoff when the
pilot felt vibration from an open cargo door, an airline spokesman
said.
   Flight 832, with 101 passengers and a crew of seven, returned
safely to Orlando International Airport, said Eastern spokesman
George Owen in Miami. No one was injured and no luggage was lost.

<TEXT>
   Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis W.
Alvarez, a brilliant and wide-ranging scientist who helped develop
the atomic bomb and a theory that asteroids wiped out the
dinosaurs, has died at the age of 77.
   Alvarez, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1968 for
his development of the liquid-hydrogen bubble chamber and for the
numerous elementary particles his team discovered using the device,
died late Wednesday at his Berkeley home.
   Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory spokeswoman Mary Barberia quoted
Alvarez's wife, Janet, as saying her husband's health had declined
since he underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor last fall, and
that he died from complications of a series of operations to treat
cancer of the esophagus.
   Alvarez, who did much of his research at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory but also was on the University of California at Berkeley
faculty, was noted not only for physics, but for his work in the
fields of archaeology, paleontology and astronomy
   During World War II, he was credited with inventing a number of
radar systems and an effective bomb sight. He also played a
significant role in developing the atomic bomb during the Manhattan
Project, invented several types of atom smashers and did a personal
analysis of evidence in the 1963 assassination of President John F.
Kennedy.
   But in the last decade, he was catapulted into headlines by the
dinosaur extinction theory he developed with his son, Berkeley
geologist Walter S. Alvarez, and Lawrence Berkeley chemists Frank
Asaro and Helen Michel.
   They argued that asteroids or comets struck the Earth 65 million
years ago, kicking up dust and smoke that blocked enough sunlight
to sharply lower surface temperatures, destroying food plants to
spur mass extinction of dinosaurs and many other species.
   The theory triggered rancorous debate that continues today and
relates to a theory that nuclear warfare would create enough smoke
to plunge Earth into a cold, dark ``nuclear winter'' that would
wipe out survivors of the nuclear exchange.
   While geologists and astronomers tend to support the dinosaur
extinction theory, biologists and fossil experts usually argue that
gradual climate change caused the mass extinction. Others argue
huge volcanic eruptions were responsible, or that asteroids caused
the mass extinction not by blocking sunlight but by triggering
intense acid rain or extreme global warming.
   University of California President David P. Gardner said he was
``personally saddened, as is the entire University of California
community, by the death of Professor Alvarez.''
   ``A creative and energetic scientist, he not only brought
recognition and honor to the university by receiving a Nobel prize,
but he also personally embodied the best of those qualities that
defined his chosen profession _ concern for the student, commitment
to meaningful and distinctive research, and devotion to the
betterment of society,'' Gardner said. `He will be missed.''
   Alvarez, born in San Francisco, was the son of Walter C.
Alvarez, a noted physician and medical columnist at Minnesota's
Mayo Clinic.
   As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Alvarez built
one of the first Geiger counters in the United States, which he
used as a graduate student to discover the East-West effect in
cosmic rays and prove that radiation from space consists mostly of
protons.
   In 1936, he began his work in Berkeley. Among his discoveries
were electron capture by nuclei, the radioactivity of tritium and
the magnetic moment of the neutron.
   He gained public notice for several applications of physics to
popular subjects. He X-rayed an Egyptian pyramid in search of
hidden chambers, only to find there were none. He developed
evidence regarding the assassination of President Kennedy which
supported the findings of the Warren Commission that Lee Harvey
Oswald was the lone assassin.
   In addition to his wife, Alvarez is survived by two sons, two
daughters, two sisters and a brother.
   Arrangements for a memorial service were pending.

   President Augusto Pinochet announced
Thursday he has lifted a ban on the return from exile of hundreds
of leftists, including some of his fiercest Marxist critics.
   Within hours of the announcement, a formerly exiled daughter of
Marxist former President Salvador Allende, whose elected government
was ousted by Pinochet in a bloody 1973 coup, arrived in Santiago.
   Four hours after Pinochet's announcement, Isabel Allende, 44,
arrived at Santiago's international airport on a flight from Buenos
Aires. She had planned the trip days earlier as a challenge to ban
against her return, but Pinochet's announcement allowed for her
re-entry to Chile without problems.
   Asked why she returned, she told reporters at the airport:
``Because it's my legitimate right.''
   She said her mother, Hortensia Bussi, the exiled widow of
Allende, also plans to return. ``We are going to prepare a grand
entrance, through the front door, as we've always said.''
   Allende's widow Hortensia said in a telephone interview in
Mexico City after learning of Pinochet's announcement: ``I am very
happy to be returning to my country. I left in the spring and I
will return in the spring.'' Winter is now ending in the Southern
Hemisphere.
   Mrs. Allende and her daughter Carmen have lived in Mexico since
the coup.
   It was the first time she had stepped on Chilean soil since she,
her mother and other members of Allende's immediate family took
refuge in the Mexican Embassy the day of the coup, departing on a
flight specially arranged by Mexico's president at the time, Luis
Echeverria. Allende died in a siege of the government palace during
the takeover.
   Also Thursday, the leader of a 16-party opposition coalition
challenged Gen. Pinochet to a televised debate during the campaign
for the Oct. 5 referendum in which the president seeks voter
approval for another eight-year term.
   Pinochet said in announcing the measure to Chilean reporters:
``The prohibitions are lifted. All of them. I have spoken this
morning with the interior minister and have given instructions with
respect to exile that totally solves this problem.''
   It was the latest of several relaxations in political
restrictions before the ``yes or no'' presidential referendum.
Pinochet's name will be the only one on the ballot.
   Interior Ministry Subsecretary Alberto Cardemil told reporters
the lifting of exile applies to all government opponents previously
banned from returning. He said they were 430 in number.
   The Roman Catholic Church human rights agency puts the total
political exiles at 504, but its list includes Chileans who changed
nationality in order to establish foreign residence or obtain work.
   Prominent exiles affected include Luis Corvalan, a former
senator and leader of the outlawed Communist Party who lives in
Moscow; Carlos Altamirano, a former leader of Allende's Socialist
Party; Anselmo Sule, a leading figure in the International
Socialist Movement, and Volodia Teitelboim, a ranking Communist
Party official.
   After taking power, Pinochet's military government arrested
thousands of leftist opponents and exiled them. According to police
figures, more than 9,000 have been authorized to return since 1982.
   Last week, Pinochet lifted all states of emergency for the first
time, and on Tuesday he won the formal backing of fellow military
commanders as the sole candidate in the upcoming referendum.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the centrist Chrisitian Democratic
Party, the country's largest, and spokesman for the coalition
challenged Pinochet to the televised debate.
   ``An open and free debate is indispensable,'' he said, and would
enable Pinochet ``to contrast his ideas with those of the
opposition.''

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
left the deadlocked Iran-Iraq peace talks Thursday and put a
Swedish diplomat in charge, while the two belligerents accused each
other of violating the cease-fire.
   Iran accused Iraq of taking more than 750 Iranian troops
prisoner in attacks since the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire began Aug.
20. The Iraqi government said Iran continued setting up observation
posts and bunkers, moving troops close to the border and launching
gunboats into the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
   U.N. observers monitoring the truce have not reported any
serious violations by either side, only ``minor problems'' that
were resolved.
   Jan Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador, arrived in the Swiss
city from New York to continue Perez de Cuellar's work of seeking a
permanent peace after eight years of war that cost up to 1 million
lives.
   Perez de Cuellar introduced Eliasson to the Iranian and Iraqi
foreign ministers in separate meetings before departing for other
U.N. duties in Lisbon. He said he could return when necessary.
   Peace talks started eight days ago but have been stalled for six
days over troop withdrawal, navigation rights and the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, which forms the southern border between the two nations
and is Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of
Iraq have not met directly since their last formal session Aug. 26,
the day after the talks began. Negotiations have continued at a
lower level.
   ``We are working at the experts' level, not the level of
ministers,'' Perez de Cuellar said Thursday. ``We hope to
accelerate the pace as much as possible, but at the moment we are
honest brokers. We cannot impose anything on the parties.''
   ``The main problem is lack of confidence,'' he told reporters as
he turned over responsibility to Eliasson. ``It is impossible to
deal on the basis of distrust. It is sand and you cannot build on
sand.''
   Eliasson, 47, assumed the ambassador's post in March. He is an
expert on the Iran-Iraq war and made 12 trips to the Persian Gulf
as part of Sweden's earlier efforts to help the United Nations find
a settlement.
   At the news conference, he said: ``The gulf (of) distrust has
been very wide and we hope it will be becoming a little bit
smaller.''
   The secretary-general said Eliason would try to arrange a
meeting of the foreign ministers, but added: ``It is a very
difficult, complicated negotiation and it needs time.''.
   When talks began Aug. 25, five days after the cease-fire, Perez
de Cuellar wanted to announce timetables for troop withdrawal,
prisoner exchange and the work of a commission to determine which
side started the war.
   Stalemate came the next day, however, and he has been unable to
break it.
   Perez de Cuellar said Thursday he believes both sides ``honestly
are interested in finding a solution to the problem, but it takes
time for the parties ... to see which way they can achieve, with
assistance of the U.N., a compromise.''
   He described the two direct meetings as ``very helpful'' because
each side officially listened to the other. They spoke through
translators and the secretary-general, however, not directly to
each other.
   A three-point U.N. compromise would guarantee free navigation
for both nations in the Persian Gulf, withdrawal to internationally
recognized borders and an impartial study of conflicting positions
on the Shatt-al-Arab.
   International pressure appears to be building on Iraq to accept
early troop withdrawal.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the
United States, Soviet Union, Britain, China and France _ support
the secretary-general and their representatives met with President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq on Wednesday.
   Iraq insists on freedom of navigation and wants Iran to stop
searching vessels bound for its ports. It also wants the U.N. to
have the Shatt-al-Arab dredged before a troop withdrawal.
   A 1975 treaty between Iraq and Iran draws the border down the
middle of the waterway, but the Iraqis says the agreement was
invalidated by the 1979 revolution that overthrew the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Iraq now claims the entire waterway.
   Iran says the first item of business is withdrawal by Iraq from
territory it captured in offensives just before the cease-fire,
with clearing of the Shatt and other issues to be discussed
afterward.
   In South Yemen's port of Aden, the first Iraqi tanker to sail
through the the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz since the
cease-fire docked with 17,000 tons of Iraqi crude oil, South
Yemen's official news agency reported Thursday.
   The Ain Zalah, which arrived Wednesday, set sail from the
southern Iraqi port of Basra on Aug. 20, the day the cease-fire
went into effect, and took 11 days to reach Aden, the agency said.

   A woman who successfully fought the city's
attempt to confine her for mental illness has been hospitalized for
the second time since being released from a psychiatric ward
earlier this year.
   Joyce Brown, who also has used the name Billie Boggs, was
admitted to St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan on Monday, but
neither the hospital nor her lawyers would say what was wrong with
her.
   Linda Greenough, a hospital spokeswoman, said Ms. Brown was
admitted for observation and was resting comfortably. She was
listed in stable condition. But Greenough said she could not
divulge the condition for which Ms. Brown was being treated.
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he has been visiting Ms. Brown nightly and
that she feels fine.
   ``She's comfortable, she's in good spirits,'' he said. ``Last
night we watched the news together.''
   Ms. Brown, 40, who moved into the Traveler's Hotel in midtown
Manhattan after she was released from Bellevue Hospital's
psychiatric ward seven months ago, entered St. Clare's for a week
in May. Published reports said she had suffered a seizure, but
Siegel said he could not confirm that.
   She was the first person picked up last fall under Mayor Edward
I. Koch's plan to hospitalize some of the mentally ill homeless.
She was released when a judge ruled that city doctors, who
contended she was psychotic, could not force her to take medication
for the condition.
   Siegel said Ms. Brown, who had been living on an Upper East Side
sidewalk, has been unable to find a regular job or her own home.
   ``She had some job offers when she was first released, but they
didn't work out,'' he said.
   Siegel said Ms. Brown still is living in what is supposed to be
a transitional residence because she has been unable to find an
apartment in Manhattan.

   A group of congressmen left Thursday for
Vietnam to evaluate the country's need for emergency food supplies
and possibilities for increased U.S. contacts with the Hanoi
government.
   They also said they hope to return with several Vietnamese
children long separated from parents living in the United States.
   The delegation was headed by Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   ``I plan to assess severe food shortages which threaten 3
million people, 40 percent of whom are children below age 14, all
on the brink of starvation,'' he said.
   Leland and Rep. Albert Bustamante, D-Texas, said they also plan
to discuss with Vietnamese officials the unfinished matter of
accounting for Americans still listed as missing in action and the
possible opening of a U.S. interests section in some friendly
country's Hanoi embassy.
   Bustamante said the delegation also plans to raise with Hanoi
officials the issue of Vietnam's 10-year occupation of Cambodia and
``will be looking for other potential openings in relations between
Vietnam and the United States.''
   Bustamante's office said the delegation will bring back two
Vietnamese children and their aunt to their family in Houston and a
third child to rejoin parents who settled in Virginia after fleeing
their homeland in 1975.
   Leland's office indicated their release could be uncertain.
   Other members of the delegation are Reps.: Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y.; Kweisi Mfume, D-Md.; and Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas. Rep.
Stephen Solarz, a New York Democrat who chairs the Foreign Affairs
Committee's Asian and Pacific subcommittee, might join the group in
Bangkok, Thailand, before it arrives in Vietnam.

<HEAD>800 Formerly Banned Books Go on Public Display in Moscow Library</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Books by former Soviet officials who fell afoul of
Josef Stalin went on public display Thursday after decades of being
banned from library shelves, an official report said.
   However, other books, including some of ``Zionist'' or
anti-Semitic content, others promoting national strife and
pornography, remained off-limits to the general reading public, a
government official said.
   A total of 800 books were exhibited at the Lenin Library, the
nation's leading library, including works by victims of the late
dictator Stalin's political purges, generals who fought against the
establishment of Soviet power, and members of the provisional
government overthrown by the Bolsheviks in 1917 October Revolution,
according to the official news agency Tass.
   Tass said the books had been ``out of the reach of general
readers for decades.'' It said they were being transferred from the
library's restricted-access stocks to general use, where they would
be accessible to the general public.
   That move was another example of the increased tolerance
fostered by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for
``glasnost,'' or greater openness. The drive has also brought about
judicial rehabilitation of Stalin foes like Bukharin and Kamenev,
who were convicted of spying in the 1930s and killed as ``enemies
of the people.'' Their books were among those on display.
   Last year, a commission was created to determine which banned
books should be transferred to public use in Soviet libraries. Its
head, Vladimir Solodin, is an official of the government agency
Glavlit, which is charged with screening the press to prevent the
publication of state secrets. It has acted in the past as chief
government censor.
   Tass quoted Solodin as saying the review commission would
conclude its work in October, and that ``about 500'' books would
remain in the restricted-access library stocks, down from 10,000
before.
   ``The books remaining there are, first of all, those of
anti-Semitic and Zionist content,'' Solodin said. ``There are other
books which propagandize national strife as well as pornographic
editions ....''
   He gave no titles or other details.
   In addition, Solodin said all works by Stalin's arch-foe Leon
Trotsky that had been published in periodicals were now in
open-access stocks.

<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday that 20,000
Kurdish refugees have been allowed into Turkey from northeastern
Iraq, where Kurdish rebels said Baghdad has launched its biggest
offensive.
   Premier Turgut Ozal Wednesday more Kurds may be be permitted to
cross the border in coming days but that the influx will be limited.
   Diplomats in Baghdad reported Iraq has taken advantage of the
Aug. 20 cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iran to intensify
operations against the autonomy-seeking Kurds, who sided with the
Iranians.
   Iraqi forces, with tanks on the ground and with jets from the
air, were bombing the Kurdish region heavily and came within a few
miles of the Turkish border, the independent Hurriyet News Agency
reported Wednesday from the border province of Hakkari.
   There was no immediate report by the Iraqi government.
   Ozal, talking to reporters after a National Security Council
meeting where the Kurdish problem was discussed, said Turkey was
taking in the refugees on humanitarian grounds.
   But, he added, ``There is a limit to how many we can admit.''
   He did not cite a figure. A spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic
Party, one of the major guerrilla groups fighting for autonomy in
northern Iraq, told The Associated Press in Nicosia in a telephone
interview that Turkey would accept 30,000.
   The spokesman said Iraq launched an ``unprecedented'' offensive
Monday against 4,000 square miles of Kurdish-claimed territory.
   ``Heavy fighting is taking place between our forces and the
Iraqi army on all fronts'' and Iraqi forces are burning villages to
the ground, the spokesman said.
   Iran also has agreed to take in the refugees from Iraq, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported from Tehran where
Nuzhet Kandemir, undersecretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, is
holding talks with Iranian officials.
   Kandemir visited Iraq on Monday and Tuesday and informed sources
in Baghdad said he had complained about Iraq's use of chemical
weapons near the Turkish border against Kurdish rebels.
   In Geneva, U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Wednesday the
world body was taking no action following allegations of the
chemical attacks, saying there was no independent confirmation. The
United Nations has condemned Iraq for use of chemical weapons
during the Iran-Iraq war.
   Turkey has its own Kurdish problem, with its military fighting a
4-year-old war with guerrillas of the Kurdish Labor Party, or PKK,
a Marxist group aiming to set up a separate Kurdish state in
Turkey's southeast provinces.
   An overwhelming majority of Turkey's estimated 10 million Kurds,
however.
   Turkey's Kurdish minority is the largest one of about 20 million
Kurds who live where borders of Iran, Iraq and Turkey converge.
There are also Kurdish enclaves in Syria and the Soviet Union.

   Delta Air Lines' policy of not counting infants
on its passenger list and misinformation from the chaotic scene led
to fluctuations in the number of people reported killed in
Wednesday's jet crash, officials said.
   At least one infant was among the 13 passengers who died when
the Delta 727 crashed shortly after takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth
Airport. Ninety-four passengers and crew members survived,
officials said.
   The number of dead fluctuated throughout the day, from seven to
15, down to nine, up to 11 and finally to 13. Bill Berry, a Delta
spokesman in Atlanta, said one reason for the discrepancies was
that officials weren't sure how many children under 2 years might
be on board.
   ``An infant does not buy a ticket, and if it does not buy a
ticket, so many times you are going to have a discrepancy in your
manifest count,'' Berry said.
   He said passengers don't normally notify ticket agents that they
plan to take an infant on board, since they are not required to pay.
   ``They'll just show up with an infant knowing they don't have to
buy a ticket,'' Berry said. ``They don't have to identify that they
have an infant with them.''
   At least three infants were on the jet Wednesday, he said. One
was among the dead, but the condition of the others was not
immediately known.
   Part of the problem Wednesday, Berry said, was that emergency
personnel requested 15 body bags _ leading Delta officials to give
out an erroneous casualty figure. Later fluctuations happened
because some victims died at hospitals.
   ``As you well know, in these types of situations, the numbers
often fluctuate until you can get various hospitals contacted,''
Berry said.

<HEAD>Non-Indian Couple Awarded Permanent Custody of Navajo Child</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A tribal court Wednesday awarded a
non-Indian couple permanent custody of a 13-month-old Navajo girl,
ending a lengthy dispute pitting the Navajo tribe against the
biological mother and foster parents.
   Navajo Tribal Children's Court Judge Manuel Watchman granted
permanent guardianship of Allyssa Kristian Keetso to Rick and
Cheryl Pitts of San Jose, Calif., approving an agreement reached
April 22.
   ``All over! We've got permanent custody,'' Mrs. Pitts said with
a broad smile as she left the courthouse.
   ``I guess I should introduce you to Allyssa Kristian
Keetso-Pitts,'' her husband told reporters as he held the girl,
adorned in Navajo jewelry and wearing an ankle-length aqua satin
skirt.
   Her biological mother, Patricia Keetso, said: ``I feel wonderful
that it's over. I'm just glad that we can all continue on and not
have to worry about what's going to happen in the future or what's
going to happen next.''
   She said she loves the Pittses and considers them as extended
family.
   Under terms of the agreement, Ms. Keetso will retain her
parental and visitation rights, as the Pittses had said they
wanted. Tribal family members also will be allowed visitation.
   Mrs. Pitts said Allyssa will retain her culture and receive a
Navajo census number as an official tribal member. ``We pretty much
all got what we all wanted. I'm so glad it's over. I feel really
happy that we can go home and be a normal family,'' she said, her
voice breaking.
   Visitation arrangements will be up to the Pittses, Ms. Keetso
and the child's grandparents, Susie and Howard Keetso, Mrs. Pitts
said.
   Under the agreement, the tribe will retain jurisdiction until
Allyssa is 18, when she can petition for adoption, Pitts said.
   As the Pittses spoke to reporters, Watchman stepped outside
briefly to shake Pitts' hand and wish the couple well.
   But the ruling did not come before brief uncertainty over yet
another possible delay.
   The case pitted the Navajo tribe against the Keetsos, who are
tribal members, and the Pittses, who initially had sought outright
adoption of Allyssa. The Keetsos supported that effort and
subsequently the guardianship plan.
   In April, a California court transferred the Pittses' adoption
petition to the tribal court in response to a tribal request to
intervene. The California judge said the tribe held jurisdiction in
determining the child's custody under the Indian Child Welfare Act,
a law intended to slow the exodus of Indian children to non-Indian
families.
   During a hearing Wednesday morning, a tribal social worker
initially sought an additional 90-day delay, requesting further
information about the Pitts' finances and home life and raising
questions about the child's heritage and culture and plans for
visitation by other tribal family members, said Pitts, 33, an
independent contractor.
   After testimony from Pitts, the request was withdrawn.

   Workers at the Lenin shipyard agreed to
end their strike today at the request of Lech Walesa, but striking
coal miners who began the current labor unrest demanded to see the
Solidarity chairman in person.
   In a breakthrough meeting with Walesa on Wednesday, senior
government officials promised talks to consider reinstating the
banned free trade union movement.
   Solidarity spokesman Piotr Niemczyk said workers at the Lenin
shipyard in this Baltic port met this morning and approved Walesa's
request.
   In the meeting with Walesa, communist authorities promised
round-table talks on legalizing Solidarity and jointly solving the
country's daunting social and economic problems.
   In exchange, they demanded an end to Poland's most serious
strike wave in seven years.

   With Labor Day approaching, Oregon officials barred the public
from woodlands and Montana's governor urged residents to ``find
asphalt'' to limit the number of new wildfires as flames threatened
homes in two states.
   Fire also blackened forest and brush Wednesday in Wyoming,
Washington, California, Idaho and Utah.
   About 180,000 more acres burned during the past week as new
blazes ignited in eastern Oregon and Washington, Northern
California and northern Idaho, a federal drought advisory issued
this week said.
   It said the northern Rockies and northern Plains remained very
dry, contributing to the worsening forest fires, and little relief
was expected soon.

House of Commons overwhelmingly approved a sweeping trade bill that
will open the border to more U.S. goods and services.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives, with
207 of the 282 seats in Commons, easily defeated the combined

   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh will
only permit Justice Department employees to take trips directly
related to their jobs, a policy that could have barred some
officials from traveling to Japan with Edwin Meese III this week, a
top aide says.
   The aide, speaking Wednesday on condition he not be identified,
said Thornburgh raised questions about the Tokyo trip taken by six
officials, but decided against canceling any part of it to spare
the Japanese hosts any embarrassment.
   ``There were international considerations to let it go ahead,''
the aide said, noting the event had been scheduled long in advance.
``It involved a foreign government and certain commitments had been
made.''

   Efforts to protect airline passengers from
rapidly spreading post-crash fires, such as the one that swept
through the Delta Air Lines jet in Texas, remain stalled after more
than a decade of frustrating research.
   Four years ago, the Federal Aviation Administration was on the
verge of requiring airliners to use a special fuel additive which
its supporters said would stop aircraft fuel vapors from igniting
in a crash.
   Although the anti-misting additive suppressed the spread of
flames in repeated static tests, a highly publicized test using a
remote-controlled Boeing 720 in the California desert failed
miserably in November 1984, as the deliberately crashed jet was
engulfed in a ball of flames.
   The failed test came only weeks before a regulation requiring
the additive was to have been announced, although the airlines had
argued the additive's value was questionable and there were
indications it could interfere with engine performance.

   Less than two years after he won re-election in an
historic landslide, Michael Dukakis finds himself in an
embarrassing position at home with a new poll showing him even with
George Bush in Massachusetts and widespread unhappiness with his
recent performance as governor.
   While aides to the Democratic presidential nominee scoffed at
the poll results and predicted Dukakis would defeat Bush handily in
Massachusetts, political observers from both parties were nearly
unanimous in blaming Dukakis' slide on a recent spate of problems
and protests related to the governor's handling of a state budget
crisis.
   Ironically, the presidential poll showing Dukakis and Bush each
with 42 percent support among Massachusetts voters was published
Thursday, a day when the Republican nominee was campaigning behind
enemy lines in Massachusetts and Dukakis was on the West Coast.

   In their skirmishes over the environment,
Republican nominee George Bush is not only battling with Michael
Dukakis but with a Reagan administration record that environmental
groups contend was often hostile to the causes of clean air, land
and water.
   Bush, who says ``I am an environmentalist, always have been,''
took the battle to Dukakis' hometown Thursday, campaigning in
Boston Harbor where he accused the Democratic nominee of dragging
his heels while the polluted harbor got ``dirtier and dirtier.''
   Dukakis has labeled Bush's environmental claims ``an
election-year conversion.'' He says Boston's harbor has ``been
polluted for hundreds of years, and I'm very proud to be the
governor who's cleaning it up ... no thanks to Vice President Bush
and the administration he is part of.''

   Shipyard and steel workers ended strikes
Thursday, and Lech Walesa urged others to halt Poland's worst labor
turmoil in seven years now that the government has agreed to
discuss Solidarity's future.
   Walesa met with ranking officials Wednesday for the first time
in six years and the government agreed to discuss the outlawed
union and other issues. Restoring Solidarity's legal status was the
main demand of the strikers.
   Workers at the Stalowa Wola steel mill in southern Poland began
leaving the plant at 7 p.m. after receiving a telephone appeal from
Walesa and a message from the Roman Catholic episcopate, a strike
committee spokeswoman said.
   At least 3,000 strikers were in the Lenin shipyard, where Walesa
works as an electrician, including workers from other yards in this
Baltic port. They hoisted Solidarity banners as members of their
strike committee led them out.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
left the deadlocked Iran-Iraq peace talks Thursday and put a
Swedish diplomat in temporary charge of trying to get the
negotiations moving again.
   Jan Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador, arrived from New York to
continue Perez de Cuellar's work of seeking a compromise between
the belligerents, who began a cease-fire Aug. 20 in an 8-year-old
war that has cost up to 1 million lives.
   Perez de Cuellar introduced Eliasson to the Iranian and Iraqi
foreign ministers in separate meetings before departing for other
U.N. duties in Lisbon. He said he could return when necessary.
   Peace talks started eight days ago but have been stalled for six
days over troop withdrawal, navigation rights and the disputed
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, that forms their southern border and is
Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of

   A truck convoy hauled nine Pershing 2 missiles from a base near

420 medium- and shorter-range missiles from Western Europe in the
next 36 months.
   ``This is an important event in post-war history,'' West German

   Measles, the once-common childhood disease,
decreased by 42 percent in the United States last year to 3,655
cases _ the first drop in four years, since the record low of 1,497
cases in 1983.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
1,010 of the cases, or 28 percent, were theoretically preventable,
occurring in people who should have been vaccinated, but weren't _
mostly preschool children.
   But nearly three-fourths of the cases _ 2,642 _ were classified
as non-preventable, occurring in patients who had been vaccinated
but got measles anyway. Most of those were schoolchildren.
   Measles has fallen 99 percent since the era before measles
vaccine was licensed in 1963, and the disease was thought headed
for eradication when the record low came in 1983. But the case
count then surprised researchers by going back up in 1984, '85 and

Even so, the opposition claims the PRI maintained its grip only

   Aung San, leader of Burma's independence struggle, was gunned
down at the age of 32 _ before, as many have suggested, the world

opposition forces.
   The 43-year-old daughter last week drew crowds of up to 400,000

rule. Some diplomats and Burmese analysts believe she will be only
a transitional figure, but one who could help unify disparate
groups and prevent a plunge into anarchy.

<HEAD>Old Icelandic Community Survives in Canada's Manitoba</HEAD>

   Here on Lake Winnipeg, just north of
Minnesota and North Dakota, a band of people fleeing natural
disasters a little over 100 years ago founded one of history's
least-known republics.
   It was called New Iceland.
   Some 20,500 descendants of those pioneers survive today as
Canadians, living in Manitoba and proudly forming the largest
Icelandic community outside the North Atlantic island itself.
   The community dates to 1873-75, when volcanic eruptions on
Iceland destroyed homes, a plague killed the sheep, summers were
icy and the cod were dwindling.
   Boarding a boat for Canada appeared the best solution, and the
result was the self-governing colony of New Iceland that existed
from 1875 to 1887.
   One of the descendants is Helgi Tomasson, 72, a ruddy-face
fisherman who has lived all his life on Lake Winnipeg's Hecla
Island.
   ``The climate is the same as Iceland or Russia _ invigorating,''
he said. ``It tends to make vigorous people,''
   Tomasson ice-fished for 20 years with only a dog team to pull
the heavy crates of pickerel and whitefish back to shore. Then he
bought a 1952 Bombardier, a tractor-like ice vehicle, which he's
managed to keep running despite winter temperatures that plunge to
22 below zero (Fahrenheit).
   It's the same spirit of self-sufficiency that enabled his
grandfather and 1,500 other settlers to face smallpox and scarlet
fever epidemics, grasshopper plagues, flooding and a religious rift
in their first tumultuous years in New Iceland.
   The immigrants signaled their determination by naming their
original settlement Gimli, a reference from Norse mythology to the
Great Hall of Gimli where gods, giants and the best of men meet
following the end of the world.
   Only about 1,000 of Gimli's 2,500 residents today are of
Icelandic heritage, but they give the town its flavor through the
99-year-old Islendingadagurinn Festival, their traditional cuisine
such as smoked lamb flanks and vine terte prune cake, and a museum
that contains a log house from the old settlement.
   Gimli has a Viking pharmacy, Viking motor lodge and Viking
travel agency. The harbor is guarded by a 15-foot statue of a
Viking wielding an ax.
   Summer tourists keep the original 1910 cash register busy at
H.P. Tergesen & Sons general store with its racks of Icelandic
sweaters and books.
   ``Our daughter is leaving to go to university in Iceland to
study Icelandic culture and literature,'' said Lorna Tergesen,
whose great-grandparents were in the first party to reach New
Iceland on Oct. 21, 1875.
   Tomasson speaks such fluent Icelandic that he felt right at home
on a visit to Iceland with his wife Helga in 1978.
   ``They asked what part of Iceland we were from and just about
keeled over when I said I was third-generation Canadian,'' said
Tomasson, whose grandfather arrived here in 1876.
   Iceland's ambassador to Canada, Ingvi Ingvarsson, said his small
nation takes pride in the cultural preservation of its former North
American colony.
   ``They speak really good Icelandic, although it's a little bit
archaic,'' he said in a telephone interview, noting that
contemporary idioms are missing from the 19th-century tongue
Icelandic-Canadians still pass on to their children.
   Icelandic is no longer taught in local elementary schools, but
the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg has a Department of
Icelandic Language and Literature, and Canadian Icelanders continue
to publish a newspaper and support cultural groups such as the
Icelandic Canadian Front.
   This cohesiveness contrasts with the integration of later
Scandinavian and German immigrants, and Professor David Arnason of
the University of Manitoba attributes the difference to the
Icelandic fascination with myth.
   ``When we tell our epic stories, they are stories located in the
new land, stories like the horrors of the smallpox epidemic when
the bodies of children were stacked on the roofs of houses so that
wolves would not get them,'' he wrote in a recent article.
   Lord Dufferin, the British Governor General of Canada in the
1870s, offered volcano-fleeing Icelanders the virgin land about 42
miles long and 11 miles wide beside Lake Winnipeg about 100 miles
north of the U.S. border.
   Cree Indians probably saved the lives of early settlers by
teaching the sea-fishing immigrants how to fish through thick ice
with nets.
   Before joining Canada's province of Manitoba in 1887, New
Iceland had its own constitution, which declared Icelandic the
official language, preserved Icelandic civil law and established an
elaborate social welfare system. Only Icelanders were allowed to
settle in the region.
   The immigrants often did without doctors or policemen, but
always built schools and began publishing a newspaper in a log
cabin within two years of arrival.
   ``They were great believers in education,'' said Tomasson.
``They all brought a little chest with them containing their most
precious books _ the Bible, the Icelandic sagas, prose and verse,
and educational books.''
   A split between strict Lutherans and a more liberal faction that
eventually became Unitarian resulted in the early exodus of
hundreds of settlers to North Dakota and western Canada, but the
towns along Lake Winnipeg have remained the center of Icelandic
culture.
   Only Hecla Island has seen a sharp decline in population, from
500 people half a century ago to four families now, following the
closing of island schools and the designation of Hecla as a
provincial park.
   ``We used to put on our own socials with accordion bands and our
own plays in Icelandic,'' recalled Tomasson, looking at the boarded
up community hall and two-room schoolhouse he attended as a boy.
``We all spoke Icelandic in those days.''

<HEAD>Local TV Hosts Get Pep Talk for Jerry Lewis Telethon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerry Lewis, who's spent a lifetime
making people laugh, was deadly serious as he faced 250 local
television personalities from cities across America _ key players
in this year's Labor Day Telethon.
   ``What probably put me in that hospital five years ago was
saying goodbye to those little giants,'' said Lewis, referring to
his 1982 double-bypass heart surgery and the children who've been
lost to muscular dystrophy in the 22 years he has been raising
money through the telethons to fight the crippling disease.
   The local TV hosts, ranging from rookies to 20-year veterans,
were gathered at Caesars Palace, where final preparations were
underway for the telethon this weekend. They spent two days mapping
strategy for what has become ``the'' telethon, Lewis' annual effort
for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
   Lewis, the consumate showman, understands the impact of the
local TV hosts in his Labor Day entertainment extravaganza. They
orchestrate the 15-minute local cutaways each hour on some 200
stations, dubbed by Lewis his ``Love Network.''
   Last year's telethon raised a record $39,021,723. The annual TV
events, which began in 1966 and feature arrays of stars who
participate at Lewis' behest, have raised $443,182,370.
   This year's show is scheduled to run from 9 p.m. EDT Sunday
until 6:30 p.m. Monday.
   ``Your work has produced some tremendous inroads this year,''
Lewis told the local TV hosts.
   ``This is my one shot at thanking you,'' he said. ``We are No. 1
because of your dedication. This year our research-and-patient-care
budget was over $100 million, thanks to you.''
   He praised the hosts who have been with the telethon for as long
as 20 years, and he promised the first-timers, ``Tis will be the
first day of the rest of your life.''
   Lewis guided the local TV hosts through an emotional three-hour
presentation of some poignant taped presentations for this year's
show and introduced several victims and their families who are
subjects of the segments.
   Paul Miller, director of the show, said his hope was that
``someday, I'll be able to say I directed the last Jerry Lewis
Telethon.''
   Singer Tony Orlando, one of the co-hosts, urged the local hosts
to make 1988 ``one more year better than the last year, so we can
get closer to that final year.''
   One of the afternoon's more dramatic moments came when the local
hosts previewed a segment on singer-comedian Dennis Day, who died
this summer of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known
as Lou Gehrig's Disease. ALS is one of 40 neuromuscular diseases
fought by MDA.
   The video segment includes old black-and-white footage of Day as
sidekick for the late Jack Benny. As some of his songs play in the
background, Day talks of his hope for beating the disease. And two
of his 10 children fight back tears as they recall the final months
of their father's life.
   ``I could see it in his eyes,'' said son Tom McNulty. ``He was
afraid. I was afraid, too, afraid of losing him.''
   McNulty then appeared in person before the local TV hosts.
   ``I wish my dad could be here to celebrate this time,'' he said.
``I wish my dad was here to sing.''
   Lewis wept at one point when Susan and Leonard DeStefano talked
of losing their daughter at the age of 6{ months.
   ``It's so hard,'' he said, hugging the parents. ``What we don't
plan on is the Susan and Leonard DeStefanos. We ask of them an
outrageous task _ to relive that pain.''
   United Airlines executive Bob Sampson, himself crippled by
muscular dystrophy, told the local hosts they hold the key to the
success of the telethon. He cried as he talked of two of his young
grandchildren who died of neuromuscular disease.
   ``They never had a chance; they never had a chance,'' Sampson
wept, as many of the hosts dabbed at their eyes. ``Let's do this
for them.''

   It is a situation in which the fate of the haves
and the have-nots are so closely linked that what happens to the
have-nots might determine how comfortably the haves live.
   It concerns the top-heavy home real estate market, one in which
the future of high-priced housing is dependent on what happens at
the lowest end of the scale, where first-time buyers generally
enter the market.
   First-time buyers increasingly are denied access to the market
by relatively high prices, insufficient incomes and rising interest
rates that push carrying charges beyond their financial abilities.
   The link to the other end of the market is this: In recent
years, the market for higher-priced housing has been made up mainly
of existing homeowners using their equity to move upto more
expensive homes.
   That is, the primary source of down-payment money for expensive
homebuyers has been the equity accumulated in starter homes.
   Very few homebuyers have been able to accumulate downpayment
money without having owned previously. Inevitably, such buyers have
been restricted at first to the least expensive ``starter'' homes.
   Those who have sought to accumulate downpayments through savings
accounts or investments have been stymied by income taxes, by home
prices increasing faster than their incomes, and by sometimes high
costs of renting.
   Now, along with higher interest rates that may make carrying
costs unaffordable, their problems with accumulating downpayments
may be worsening.
   A study of first-time homebuyers, conducted for the National
Association of Realtors, shows that housing affordability is now
lower than it was 11 years ago. First-time buyers, it said, are
losing ground.
   The study found that in this year's second quarter, a typical
family of renters had only 79.8 percent of the income needed to
qualify for a conventional mortgage with 10 percent down on a
median-priced starter home.
   In contrast, the typical family in early 1977 had 88.9 percent
of the necessary income.
   The baby-boom had a lot to do with the situation, since it
filled the market with an overflow of potential buyers and a
relative scarcity of houses. Thus, housing had its own inflation,
apart from general consumer inflation.
   In 1977, the median price of an existing single-family home was
$42,900; it was more than double that in 1987. The median price of
a new single-family home was $48,000 in 1977; it was about double
that in 1987.
   A big demand and a limited supply helped do that. But
supply-demand also affected the job market. Glenn Crellin, Realtor
economist, observes that ``the growth in incomes of the baby-boom
generation has been held back to some extent by the same
(supply-demand) phenomenon.''
   He explains: ``There are lots of baby-boomers but not as many
mid- and upper-level jobs. The result is that incomes have not
increased as rapidly as previous generations have seen.''
   It poses this threat to housing prices: If fewer buyers can
afford starter homes, which are the primary source of downpayments
for more expensive homes in the future, a prop will have been
removed from the upper end of the market.
   There may be an offset to the situation in the demographics.
   As the population bulge works its way through the economy there
will be a somewhat reduced demand for starter homes, a reduction
that might be reflected in a slowdown of price increases.
   The bulge of baby-boomers then will be in an older age category,
one in which couples historically seek more expensive housing.
There will, therefore, be a lot more people in the expensive-home
market.
   But, unless several factors are in their favor, including better
incomes and lower interest rates _ a big question remains:
   If they can't buy starter houses now, where will the
downpayments come for the bigger, more expensive houses in the
future?
   Moreover, if prices for starter homes don't rise as fast as in
the past, a reflection of reduced demand, won't that diminish the
equity available to those seeking to move up to more expensive
homes?
   That poses another question:
   Given such factors, can the upper end of the market maintain its
high prices?

^Black Medical School in South Africa Debunks Skeptics</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   GA-RANKUWA, South Africa (AP) _ A creation of apartheid
politics, South Africa's black medical school is producing 70 badly
needed doctors a year, and even those who oppose it concede it is
advancing black medicine in the country.
   South Africa has 26 million blacks but only about 800 black
doctors, as opposed to more than 21,000 white doctors among its 5
million whites.
   When the Medical University of Southern Africa was established
11 years ago in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, however, many
activists rejected the school as an inferior institution built to
keep medical training segregated.
   However, modern facilities and a qualified staff have helped the
university graduate 273 doctors who work in some of the country's
best hospitals as well as remote rural areas where health workers
are in severely short supply.
   ``The students reject the idea of segregated education, but we
accept that we are getting good training,'' said a 26-year-old
student asking to be identified only as Gwen.
   The school's new buildings and landscaped grounds sit behind a
barbed-wire fence 20 miles outside Pretoria, the capital. The
pristine campus appears out of place in dusty, run-down Ga-Rankuwa,
a sprawling collection of dirt roads and squatter shacks.
   Many of the prospective doctors come from similarly impoverished
communities. Some students arriving for the six-year program live
with electricity for the first time, and most have little or no
experience in laboratories.
   ``When students come here, they face tremendous adjustments,''
said the vice principal, Len Karlsson, who is white, as are all the
top administrators. ``The pace and the intensity of the program is
unlike anything they've experienced previously.''
   He said black public high schools do not adequately prepare
students for the rigors of medical school, and therefore the
university often selects older students with some practical medical
experience.
   About half the students are at least 25 years old and most have
worked in the health care field before enrolling, said Karlsson.
   The university offers remedial courses in most basic subjects,
but the failure rate remains high. About 40 percent of the 120
first-year students fail, although they are given the chance to
repeat.
   The university is expanding its entering class annually and is
one of the largest medical schools in Africa with about 1,500
students including its denistry, veterinary, nursing and
post-graduate programs.
   The school, referred to by the acronym MEDUNSA, produces half of
South Africa's 140 new black physicians each year. The rest come
from schools that are predominantly white, such as the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   ``MEDUNSA is producing some outstanding doctors,'' said Dr.
Nthato Motlana, a prominent anti-apartheid activist who runs a
clinic in Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg.
   Motlana and other activists initially opposed MEDUNSA, calling
it a ``racist plan to build black medical school out in the bush.''
   Motlana still opposes segregated schools, but says MEDUNSA has
served to increase the meager supply of black doctors.
   Health services remain segregated, and the shortage of doctors
and facilities is acute in most black areas.
   Johannesburg's main white hospitals are about 50 percent empty,
while an average of more than 200 patients sleep on the floor each
night at Soweto's 2,700-bed Baragwanath Hospital, the only
full-service health facility for the township's 2.5 million
residents.
   Despite the overcrowding at black hospitals in urban areas, the
quality of care is much higher than in rural areas where the
doctors are far too few and the facilities often inadequate or
non-existent, Motlana said.
   MEDUNSA encourages graduates who want to work in rural areas,
but most students are from the cities and see no incentive to
relocate, school officials and students said.
   To combat the dearth of rural doctors, black homeland
governments provide scholarships for MEDUNSA students, who then are
required to return to work in the territories for several years
after graduation.
   ``Until its becomes attrative for doctors to practice in rural
areas most blacks will have trouble getting adequate health care,''
said Motlana. ``MEDUNSA has helped the situation, but it is not
enough by itself.''
   The university is financially supported by the South African
government, but students are required to pay a tuition the
equivalent of about $2,500 a year.
   Virturally every student receives some form of financial aid,
however.
   School officials say U.S. companies were generous with
scholarship money, but many of them have pulled out of South Africa
because of its apartheid policies and no longer donate funds.
   School officials didn't have exact figures on the reduction in
American assistance, but said its amounts to thousands of dollars
annually. Some U.S.-based firms still operating in South Africa,
including 3M, Colgate, and Johnson and Johnson, continue to provide
scholarship money.

<HEAD>A Vision Shared: Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly Tribute Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He was the spiritual father of American folk
music, an artist with a social conciousness who captured the hopes,
dreams, joys and sorrows of a nation in such political anthems and
protest songs as ``This Land Is Your Land.''
   His name was Woody Guthrie, and he inspired generations of
singers and composers, including Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and his
son, Arlo Guthrie.
   But if Guthrie was the spiritual daddy of folk music, then
Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter) was its granddaddy.
   The two heroes who carved a music for the common people are
celebrated on a new album, ``Folkways: A Vision Shared,'' subtitled
``A Tribute to Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly.''
   The album, the brainchild of Bob Dylan, features performances of
Guthrie and Leadbelly's work by such artists as Dylan, Seeger,
Bruce Springsteen, Arlo Guthrie, U2, Little Richard, John Cougar
Mellencamp, Willie Nelson, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Emmylou Harris
and Taj Mahal.
   Royalties from the LP will be donated to the Smithsonian
Institution which bought Folkways Records last year from the estate
of its founder, Moses Asch. The Birch Tree Group of Princeton,
N.J., now manages marketing and distribution. Folkways was a label
that championed folk music and its stars and is perhaps the most
complete library of folk music in existence.
   Asch, son of novelist Sholem Asch, founded the Folkways label in
1947 with recordings of Leadbelly and such country-blues musicians
as Jack Dupree, Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brown McGhee.
``Mo'' Asch, who died in 1986 at the age of 81, was interested in
documenting traditional music and sounds from around the world.
   Folkways recorded Guthrie and Seeger as well as jazz,
Appalachian music, gospel, spoken words _ speeches, poetry and
plays, children's songs, ragtime, environmental sounds _ from
street noises to the conversation of frogs, and traditional music
from around the world. Asch produced more than 2,100 records during
his 50-year career and tried to keep them all available for sale to
the general public and as a reference resource for scholars.
   Showtime will air a special about the project on Sept. 17, with
footage from some of the recording sessions and an interview with
Springsteen, who often includes a Guthrie song or two in his
concerts. In October, ``A Vision Shared'' will go on sale in video
stores.
   Springsteen sings ``I Ain't Got No Home'' and ``Vigilante Man,''
both written by Guthrie. Brian Wilson sings Leadbelly's ``Goodnight
Irene.'' Dylan sings Guthrie's ``Pretty Boy Floyd.''
   Dylan was fascinated by Guthrie from the first time he ever
heard one of his records growing up in Minnesota. He visited
Guthrie in the hospital during his last days, and cheered the
composer by singing his songs to him. Guthrie died at Creedmoor
State Hospital in New York in 1967 at the age of 55 following a
13-year battle with Huntington's Chorea.
   Dylan wrote a Guthrie-style talking blues for his first record
album. When the Smithsonian bought Folkways, which included
recordings by Guthrie (1912-1967) and Leadbelly (1885-1949), plus
the Woody Guthrie Archives, it was suggested to Dylan that he give
a benefit concert to help pay for it. He suggested more might by
raised by a recording.
   Joe McEwen, artists and repertory director at Columbia Records
and one of four executive producers of ``A Vision Shared,''
recently talked about the significance of the record.
   ``I think the fact that these songs can still be translated into
the 1980s shows that this music, its passions and experiences, are
universal,'' he said. ``The fact that contemporary artists are
interpreting these songs shows they're still as vital today as when
originally written.
   ``These are great American folk songs, part of a tradition that
will always be with us. I think it's encumbent upon us to keep
reinvestigating this tradition.''
   McEwen couldn't predict how the LP, released Aug. 23, would sell.
   The executive producers made a list of some 40 performers _
giving no preference to those signed to Columbia Records _ to be
invited to perform.
   ``Dylan had done his song. That gave the project some
credibility,'' McEwen said. Most artists chose the songs they
performed. Executive producers made sure they didn't duplicate and
sometimes suggested tunes.
   ```This Land Is Your Land' was obviously designated for Pete
Seeger from the beginning. And `Rock Island Line' seemed to make a
lot of sense for Little Richard. It sounded like his kind of song.''
   Doc Watson plays guitar with Seeger, who sometimes performed on
the same bill with Guthrie and Leadbelly in his youth and, at 69,
continues to sing songs by both of them. The Los Angeles rock
group, Fishbone, performs with Little Richard.
   ``We wanted a real cross-section of different styles of music. I
think we achieved that,'' said McEwen.
   Asking performers and getting responses was quick, he said, so
fast that there wasn't time to take volunteers. Performers and
their own producers then went into recording studios around the
country during a year and a half. U2, the Irish superstars and only
non-American participants, used the Sun studios in Memphis, Tenn.,
during an American tour.
   The general idea in recording, McEwen says, was ``simplicity _
to maintain the integrity of the original sound while doing a
personal interpretation.
   ``Brian Wilson's `Goodnight Irene' doesn't sound like
Leadbelly's. It's probably the most different from the original, on
the album.''
   McEwen has been asked why there isn't one cut each by Guthrie
and Leadbelly. ``I didn't think of it and it was never brought up
in conversations any of us had,'' he said.
   ``I think the Smithsonian is doing a record of the original
versions of these same songs.''

<HEAD>U.S. Experts Working to Preserve King Midas' Tomb in Turkey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ZEYNEP ALEMDAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YASSIHOYUK, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the middle of this sun-baked
Anatolian plateau in western Turkey, U.S. archaeologists are
working to preserve the tomb of King Midas, around whom grew the
myth of the golden touch.
   Archaeologists believe the 2,600-year-old tomb is the oldest
standing wooden structure in the world.
   About 90 pyramid-shaped mounds of earth rise on the land where
the Phrygians had their ancient capital of Gordion.
   The largest and highest of the burial mounds is believed to be
the tomb of King Midas, believed to have lived from 725 B.C. to 675
B.C.
   The tomb chamber, within a mound about 150 feet high and 900
feet in diameter, has started to show signs of deterioration,
mostly because of lack of air circulation and the high rate of
humidity inside the grave.
   ``There are cracks in the north wall and the wall is slightly
bulging out,'' explained Professor Kenneth Sams of the University
of North Carolina, who has undertaken the preservation work in the
name of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.
   ``There is no imminent danger of collapse but we want to keep
this unique monument as it is for the coming generations,'' he said.
   The tomb was excavated in 1957 under the direction of the late
Rodney S. Young of the University of Pennsylvania.
   According to historians, it was the Phrygians who first
introduced the tumulus, or mound, burial style in Anatolia. This
small central Anatolian village is 60 miles southwest of the
Turkish capital city of Ankara.
   Thirty grave chambers have been excavated, 25 by the U.S.
excavators over the past few decades and the rest by the Germans in
1900.
   The Midas chamber was made of squared logs and an outer casing
of round logs of juniper and pine to take the pressure of the
rubble from a wall covering the tomb. Phyrgians built a roof and a
waterproof stone covering on top of the tomb and then covered it
with tons of earth.
   The body and funeral gifts were placed inside the rectangular
chamber, which measures about 320 square feet.
   Large white fungi today cover the upper sections of the wooden
chamber.
   ``They are slowly eating the wood,'' says Sams. ``We have to
bring mycologists (fungi specialists) here to determine how many
kinds of fungi exist here and why they find this place so
comfortable.''
   Sams said the archaeologists are in the preliminary stage of the
conservation work. First, they are trying to find the reason for
the fluctuations in the humidity, which ranges from a low of 35
percent to a high of 85 percent, while temperatures remain steady
throughout the year at about 60 degrees.
   The Phrygians moved into Anatolia from Thrace and the Balkan
peninsula in 10th century B.C. and became the major power in Asia
Minor in the 9th century B.C., inheriting the remains of the
Hittite civilization. They served as a cultural bridge from the
Hittites to the Anatolian civilizations of the Lydians and the
Greeks.
   They bequeathed to Greek mythology and Roman religion their
mother-goddess Cybele.
   Professor Ekrem Akurgal, one of Turkey's most prominent
archaeologists, said many Phyrgian kings were named Midas, but the
one whose tomb is being preserved is the great monarch who
established Phrygian hegemony in Asia Minor and is mentioned in
Assyrian tablets of the period.
   Akurgal said this Midas is the one on whom the legend of the
golden touch is based.
   According to the legend, Midas, son of King Gordius, was a
spendthrift who begged the gods for the power to turn anything he
touched to gold. His wish was granted but Midas nearly starved
because even the food he tried to eat turned to gold.
   The curse was lifted when he cleansed himself by bathing in the
river Pactolus, known today as Sart Cayi, famous for its golden
sands.
   The burial mounds are on a site on which, according to Greek
legend, Gordius tied his cart to a pole with an intricate knot _
the Gordian knot. Oracles said that whoever untied the knot would
rule Asia. Alexander the Great cut the knot with a stroke of his
sword, according to the story.
   Archaeologists today are particularly interested in the woodwork
of the Phrygians.
   In the Midas burial chamber, excavators found remains of tables,
inlaid wooden screens, bronze and leather belts, bronze cauldrons
and other items lying beside the skeleton of the king.
   A team of U.S. art conservators and archaeologists led by
Elizabeth Simpson of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York are
restoring these artifacts.
   ``This extraordinary furniture from Gordion occupies a special
place in the history of woodworking and of ancient art in
general,'' she said. ``The inlay work is ingenious, the geometric
decoration bold and elegant.''
   The Phrygians used wood of contrasting colors and displayed a
unique sense of design in symmetry and patterns, she said. The
findings from the tombs are alsoimportant because very little
ancient wooden furniture has survived.
   The team members have so far restored two inlaid screens and a
wooden table that are on display in Ankara's Anatolian
Civilizations Museum.
   Their restoration work, sponsored by the U.S. Kress Foundation
of New York City continues at the laboratory of the Ankara museum.

   Robert Wilke parlayed $500 and frugality into
a quarter-million-dollar estate, but after eight decades of tending
his finances' growth, his harvest is heartache. At age 103, his
yield is unhappiness.
   A family feud has grown up over who should handle his money and
how his estate should be divided. As a result, the courts have
declared him incompetent and placed him and his personal wealth
under guardianships.
   Advocates for the elderly say proposed reforms in Pennsylvania's
guardianship law might have spared him anguish and indignities in
old age, including three medical examinations and the loss of many
of his rights.
   On the one side are Wilke and his two sons, Robert, 60, and
William, 54. On the other side are his two daughters, Frances
McAleer, 62, and Sylvia Eaborn, 50, who successfully petitioned a
judge to declare him incompetent and to appoint guardians to make
his personal and financial decisions.
   It was in the midst of the incompetency hearings in April that
Wilke's wife of 63 years, Amelia, died at age 89, and his mourning
for her mixes with bitterness toward his daughters, with whom he no
longer speaks.
   ``Both daughters wanted to take everything over that I worked
all my life for,'' Wilke contends, even though an audit found no
impropriety when Mrs. McAleer was handling his day-to-day finances.
   ``I can't even spend my money after saving it,'' complains
Wilke, who started work at age 15 for a dollar-and-a-half a week.
``When you think you got money, you ain't got nothin'.''
   He never earned more than $4,200 a year in 57 years of work as a
machinist and maintenance engineer. He retired at age 72.
   He started saving when he was 29 by putting $500 from his share
of the family house, sold upon his father's death, into five banks.
   Shopping for bargains and rarely traveling, Wilke saved and
saved. His will provided that each of his children would receive
one-fourth of the accumulated wealth.
   After he and his wife entered a nursing home, he asked his elder
daughter in late 1986 to help with his bill-paying and other
accounts and gave her legal authority under a power of attorney.
   Still, he continued to monitor his finances, and at one point
their figures conflicted. Father accused daughter of being unable
to explain how $20,000 was spent.
   Last October, Wilke transferred his power of attorney to his
sons. He also changed his will to make the sons executors instead
of the daughters.
   ``I cried the whole day,'' Mrs. McAleer testified. ``My heart
was broken that my father would do this to me without telling me.''
   Mrs. McAleer and her sister filed the incompetency petition 2{
weeks later, and an Orphans Court judge declared Wilke incompetent
on June 1, naming the Pittsburgh National Bank as his financial
guardian and a lawyer as his personal guardian.
   The incompetency petition upset Wilke so much that he rewrote
his will in March. Now, the daughters are to receive 10 percent
each, the sons 40 percent each.
   The daughters declined to be interviewed, but their lawyer,
Geoffrey P. Wozman, said they apparently ``wanted protection''
after Mrs. McAleer was accused.
   ``I don't think they particularly thought the sons were going to
take his money. They didn't think the sons were the proper people
to take care of it. They didn't think they were either. No matter
who controls the money, someone is going to complain they're not
doing something right,'' Wozman said.
   Explaining why the guardianship was sought, the lawyer said the
old man was not ``rational in terms of financial affairs.''
   A psychiatrist testifying for the daughters said Wilke was
incompetent ``due to the infirmities of old age.'' Another
psychiatrist testified for the sons that while Wilke needed help
managing his finances, he found no evidence of incompetency. A
third psychiatrist, appointed by the court, examined Wilke seven
weeks after he was declared incompetent and concluded that he is
``suffering from some mild cognitive impairment.''
   When the guardianship was declared, Wilke lost the right to
vote, to make decisions about his own health care and to travel
without approval from his guardian.
   Against his wishes, he was initially ordered back into a nursing
home. Later, the judge allowed him to continue to live with son
William in suburban Green Tree, where he had moved after his wife's
death. The elder Wilke is permitted to keep his monthly $537 Social
Security check and his $210 pension check for expenses and for
spending money.
   ``I think the Wilke case provides an example of flaws in our
current state law,'' said Dr. Linda M. Rhodes, secretary of the
Pennsylvania Department of Aging.
   Among proposed legal changes now before the Legislature is a
provision to authorize limited guardianships for people who are
only ``partially incapacitated,'' as two doctors found Wilke to be.
   A number of states already allow such guardianships, which
tailor assistance to specific areas, such as managing a person's
income and assets, while leaving most rights intact.
   Current Pennsylvania law does not recognize partial incompetence
and allows only for a blanket guardianship, under which virtually
all decision-making is turned over to someone else.
   ``Here's an individual who could use some assistance in
financial planning but certainly he can make choices we all make
every day,'' Mrs. Rhodes said of Wilke.
   At a Department of Aging hearing last month, Wilke himself
testified in favor of the reform bill, which would also eliminate
``infirmities of old age'' as a reason for a finding of
incompetency. An individual's faculties, not birth date, should be
the deciding factor, department officials have argued.
   Meanwhile, Wilke is challenging the incompetency finding. A
hearing is set before an Orphans Court panel Sept. 12.
   As he sits in a rocking chair, watching the news or the Pirates
ballgames, the white-haired man ponders what he'll do if he's
declared competent and gets control of his money again.
   He'll pay off some bills, he says, and visit his son Robert, who
lives in Tallahassee, Fla. William says his father also feels he
should pay him and his wife, Margaret, for his care and shelter, no
more than $1,000.
   But reconciliation with his daughters is not in the cards.
   ``They're looking out for themselves, not me,'' he said. ``It
hurt me a lot. I just can't forget.''

   Before he toppled Burma's civilian
democracy, Gen. Ne Win decried military interference in politics.
After taking power, he promised a ``Burmese Way'' brand of
socialism that would bring prosperity.
   Each man, he said, would be able to buy at least four
sarong-like longyis a year.
   A quarter century later, Ne Win's ``Burmese Way'' has turned out
to be the wrong way for Burmese.
   _His nation, potentially one of Asia's most prosperous, is
formally classified as among the world's neediest.
   _The country now is in upheaval, with soldiers gunning down
demonstrators daring to go into the streets to demand a democratic
system now that Ne Win has announced his retirement. The very
defiance of the crowds in itself presents a serious challenge to a
military seeking to maintain an authoritarian grip on the country.
   But the embers setting off the explosions in the streets today
apparently have been smouldering for years.
   Like many necessities in Burma after 26 years of the ``Burmese
Way,'' the simple longyis worn by most men have become luxury items
_ their price has risen 1,500 percent since Ne Win's promise in
1962, while wages have gone up a mere 35 percent.
   With the price of a longyi now equivalent to a month's wages for
the average Burmese, Ne Win's promise has been relegated to a host
of other blasted expectations about the man and his system.
   Some analysts maintain the 77-year-old Ne Win, who retired July
23, is still pulling the political strings in Burma where mass
demonstrations have been directed at tearing down his political and
economic structure.
   Others believe that Ne Win, ailing and perhaps shaken by the
course of events, has truly stepped aside.
   In either case, the legacies of Ne Win _ one-party rule,
isolationism, ethnic insurgencies and his ``Burmese Way'' _ have
sunk tenacious roots and could prove difficult to remove.
   Since his retirement Ne Win has been succeeded by widely
disliked former general, Sein Lwin, and then by a civilian lawyer,
Maung Maung, the current leader. Both are Ne Win loyalists. Sein
Lwin resorted to shooting hundreds of demonstrators and jailing
vocal opponents to stay in power the short time he did.
   ``Ne Win has created an apparatus with a vested interest in
being perpetuated,'' said one senior U.S. government official. ``At
least two generations of military officers have a stake in keeping
the system intact.''
   Josef Silverstein, a leading American scholar on Burma, says
effecting ``miracle solutions'' to Burma's myriad problems ``would
require the men in power to abandon the system and sack
themselves.'' Then a good deal of Ne Win's work could be undone, he
believes, if enough capable people came forward to take over.
   Beset by as many as a million demonstrators after he took over,
Maung Maung has promised to pave the way to democracy and usher in
wide-ranging economic reforms. But some skepticism exists because
the government's word so far has been unreliable: past promises of
reforms, including some made to major foreign aid donors, either
have not been kept or proved cosmetic.
   A poster recently on a wall in Rangoon, the capital, read: ``26
years in vain, 26 years of pain.''
   In the political field, dismantling Ne Win's legacy would mean
dissolving the 1.1 million-member Burma Socialist Program Party and
an array of institutions, from the village level up, created to
support the sole power center.
   It would also mean clipping the wings of an entrenched military.
   Bestriding the apex of the system was Ne Win _ charming,
ruthless and cunning, maintaining what many analysts say was a
greater hold on power than virtually any of the world's dictatorial
figures.
   Outright opponents were jailed or fled the country. A half dozen
rising stars within Ne Win's own ranks _ from Vice Chief of Staff
Kyaw Zaw in 1957 to Brig. Tin Oo in 1983 _ were dismissed or
imprisoned.
   Thus, Ne Win has seemingly left Burma without any viable
leaders, within or outside the system. Anti-government forces,
having nobody to turn to, invoke heroic figures from the past.
Diplomats describe the top government and party ranks as generally
unimpressive.
   ``They're from the back row of the chorus line,'' said Max
McGrath, a former journalist in Rangoon and spokesman for Burmese
emigres in London.
   Robert H. Taylor, a Burma scholar at the University of London,
believes some of Burma's current turmoil can be attributed to a
struggle for leadership succession.
   ``Ne Win pulls out his thumb and the dam collapses,'' Taylor
said in an interview.

   In the economic field, Ne Win's centralized socialism has long
tottered on the edge of total collapse and Western experts say only
a major policy reorientation, large-scale foreign investment and
new, well-trained economic managers can reverse the downward spiral.
   The ``Burmese Way'' forced the expulsion of some 200,000 Indians
and Chinese, who formed much of the entrepreneurial class, and
impelled thousands of Burmans, including members of one of the best
civil services the British colonials left behind, to seek new lives
abroad.
   Closing its doors to private investment, the government set up
23 state corporations staffed largely by officials fearful of
making even trivial decisions and, by the government's own
admission, susceptible to corruption.
   Privately Burmese say the only successful entity has been
``Corporation 24,'' the vast black market fed by border smugglers
on which citizens must rely for everything from matches to
medicines. By contrast, the shelves of government stores are barely
stocked, factories operate far below capacity and a $4 billion
foreign debt makes even essential imports problematic.
   Another vast drain on the economy has been the war Rangoon wages
against rebels from a dozen ethnic minorities who demand the
greater autonomy once promised them.
   Although ethnic dissent flared before 1962, the insurgencies
have intensified greatly under Ne Win who refused reconciliation
except under his own terms. Instead, the armed forces were built up
to the current 185,000 level and more than 30 percent of the annual
budget is being spent on what has proved an unwinnable war.
   Silverstein regards the ``civil war'' as perhaps Ne Win's most
odious legacy, one that has exacerbated previously existing
tensions between the Burman majority and minority groups.
   ``It prevents the emergence of a genuine national feeling
amongst the peoples of Burma,'' Silverstein said in an interview.
   In its relations to the outside world, Ne Win laid down strict
neutralism and isolationism as cornerstones of policy.
   Haunted by the British colonial yoke and exploitation by
outsiders, beset by fears of being drawn into conflicts such as
were then engulfing Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, Burma retreated
into a hermit existence. It kept all superpowers at arm's length
and ousted foreigners and their ``decadent alien culture.''
   Little touched by Western influences, spared the ills of rapid
development, picturesque Burma captivates many outsiders. Crime,
pollution, heart attacks are rare; closely knit-family life and
traditions vanishing in other parts of Asia remain strong.
   ``The reassertion of Burmeseness, rightly or wrongly, is going
to be regarded in the minds of future Burmese as a positive
legacy,'' Silverstein said. ``They will say: `We are still our own
people doing things in our own way, finding solutions within our
own capabilities.' ''
   Although the government claims to have preserved Burmese
culture, there has been no evidence of fresh, meaningful artistic
or intellectual activity since 1962.
   ``Those who have money talk about Burmese cultural purity,''
said a senior U.S. diplomat in 1977. ``Those who don't will gladly
trade their purity for rice.''
   During the Ne Win years, annual per capita income stagnated at
below $200 and the country was officially designated by the United
Nations last year as one of the world's 41 least developed nations.
   Many Burmese privately express shame at this turn of fortune,
seeing themselves far oustripped by neighbors with far fewer
resources than this fabulously endowed country.
   Although Burma's chaotic experiment with democracy was used by
Ne Win as a pretext for usurping power, many accounts say that by
1962 the country was making good progress in its infancy of
independence and recovering from the immense destruction of World
War II.
   According to Silverstein, petroleum production was 52 percent,
teak 93 percent and rice production 93 percent of prewar levels.
   Before the war Burma was the world's No. 1 rice exporter. More
than 1 million tons were exported in 1962. This year exports will
probably not reach more than 100,000 tons, and food shortages are
occurring.
   Burma the rice bowl has become Burma the begging bowl.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Democrats Likely To Keep Senate Grip Despite GOP
Upset Hopes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With just two months left until Election Day,
Republicans are hoping George Bush and a little bit of luck will
help them claim enough of the 33 Senate seats up for grabs this
year to oust Democrats from control.
   GOP strategists say that goal remains within reach, but concede
it will take a strong showing by their presidential nominee and a
sweep of virtually every close Senate race for them to pull it off.
   ``I can't look you in the eye and say we're going to take it
over,'' said Tom Mason, spokesman for the National Republican
Senatorial Committee. ``But with good breaks, a strong
top-of-the-ticket effort which we're getting ... and with general
good luck, we could do it.''
   That luck seems to be elusive so far. Nonpartisan analysts say
Democrats seem to be having some early success in steering the
debate to domestic issues which they charge have been neglected
during the Reagan era, such as child and health care, jobs and the
environment.
   ``There is a subtle but important shift in priorities,'' says
Charles Cook, who publishes a political newsletter in Washington.
He sees the public shifting its perception of the Democrats from
association with discredited policies of the past to emergence as
the party of the future.
   Cook says it is ironic that because of President Reagan's
successes on national security and the economy, those issues have
faded into the background.
   ``When you're not in immediate danger of losing your job and
you're not in danger of getting blown up, these other issues
percolate to the top,'' Cook said. ``They're Democratic issues that
the Republicans should also be able to take advantage of, but in a
way they (the GOP) are getting robbed.''
   Major Senate battlegrounds are scattered all across the country
_ from California, Nevada and Washington in the West to Nebraska,
Wisconsin and Minnesota in the Middle West, Florida and Mississippi
in the South and Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut in the
Northeast.
   Democrats now hold a 54-46 edge in the Senate, which they won
back in 1986 after six years of GOP dominance. While the arithmetic
theoretically favors the GOP _ they are defending just 15 seats
compared with the Democrats' 18 _ neither side appears likely to
gain or lose more than two or three seats.
   Attention so far has focused on six seats being vacated by
retiring incumbents and another half-dozen or so states where
incumbents are endangered or will have to scramble to withstand
well-known and well-financed challengers.
   Most questionable for the Democrats are three seats being
vacated by senior senators _ Lawton Chiles of Florida, William
Proxmire of Wisconsin and John Stennis of Mississippi.
   Republicans also are vacating three seats. The seat held by
outgoing Sen. Paul Trible of Virginia is a solid bet to be seized
by former Democratic Gov. Charles Robb. The GOP has a better chance
of holding onto Sen. Robert Stafford's seat from Vermont, where
Republican Rep. Jim Jeffords is considered the favorite. The
Washington seat of Sen. Dan Evans is considered a tossup.
   Complicating matters for Republicans is the endangered status of
three incumbents.
   Sen. Chic Hecht in Nevada appears most likely to fall to a
strong Democratic challenge from Gov. Richard Bryan. In Nebraska,
where David Karnes was appointed to the Senate last year, popular
former Gov. Bob Kerrey is considered a good bet to defeat him. A
combination of factors has put veteran Rhode Island Sen. John
Chafee in jeopardy of being bumped off by Lt. Gov. Richard Licht.
   Thus far in the campaign, no strong national trend has emerged
in the issues that Senate candidates are running on. But polls show
that after eight years of Reagan, the public seems ready for a
change. Overall, Senate candidates are sounding less ideological
and more pragmatic than at any time in the past decade.
   Seeking to exploit this perceived public mood, the Democrats are
offering to meet a wide range of domestic needs, although
candidates usually avoid any talk of the need for higher taxes to
pay for it.
   ``They are talking about taking care of problems in their own
neighborhoods and states,'' says Bob Chlopak, executive director of
the Democrats' Senate campaign arm.
   ``It starts with shoring up the economy. That means trade in
some places, manufacturing jobs or high-tech education in others.
It is children and opportunties for the next generation ... health
care ... Social Security,'' Chlopak said. ``We've ignored those for
too long.''
   National defense and foreign policy, the issues that helped
sweep Reagan into office and win GOP control of the Senate in 1980,
seem less significant in most races even for Republicans, Chlopak
says.
   ``A signficant number of Republican Senate nominees are running
on `change' sorts of themes,'' he said. ``They are distancing
themselves from the administration and in many instances from their
own voting records.''
   He notes that in Washington state, former Sen. Slade Gorton, a
Republican, is making a comeback bid based in part on chiding the
Reagan administration for neglecting certain domestic problems.
   In Mississippi, Republican Rep. Trent Lott is running for
Stennis' Senate seat talking about college tuition assistance and
more spending for highways. Reagan vetoed a major highway
construction bill.
   Republicans aren't conceding the point, however.
   The GOP's Mason believes economic themes play well for
Republican candidates, and says the party can claim credit for an
absence of direct national security threats. ``Peace and prosperity
issues ring pretty true,'' he said.

   Incumbents traditionally hold an overwhelming
advantage in House races _ good news for the majority Democrats
this year and a continuing source of frustration for the Republican
opposition.
   The Democrats, with 256 seats in the 435-member House, say they
hope to win an extra three to five slots in 1988. The Republicans,
with 177 seats, are looking for a similar gain. There are currently
two vacancies.
   House-watchers say the modest projections _ a maximum five seats
plus or minus _ signal a year of limited ambitions. But Peggy
Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, disagrees.
   A gain of three to five seats is ``a fairly bold prediction,''
she said in light of Democratic failures in past presidential years.
   The recent high-water mark was 1964 _ the year of the Lyndon
Johnson landslide and 37 new Democratic House seats. In 1976, the
last time the party won the White House, the gain was one seat.
Since 1960, presidential-year losses have ranged from five House
defeats in 1968 to 33 in 1980.
   With the sky-high safe rate of incumbency, the best
opportunities for both parties continue to be seats left open by
death or departure. But there are only 26 this year, compared to 41
in 1986.
   A dozen of the open seats are currently held by Democrats and 14
by Republicans. Connolly said only two of the Democratic seats _ a
Florida district represented by Dan Mica and the New Jersey
district represented by the late Jim Howard _ are vulnerable to GOP
challengers.
   By contrast, she said Democratic candidates are competitive for
almost all of the 14 open GOP districts. But Rich Galen, a
spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said
simply being competitive ``doesn't turn the tide.''
   Galen said the 14 districts coming open are traditionally
Republican and likely to send GOP successors to Congress. ``I won't
concede any of those as potential losses,'' he said.
   Despite the advantages of incumbency, which range from heavy
financial contributions to cheap satellite time, there likely will
be a handful of casualties. In 1986, eight incumbents seeking
re-election were defeated. This year, the first was Rep. Ernest
Konnyu, R-Calif., who lost a primary.
   Some of the endangered lawmakers, like Reps. David Skaggs,
D-Colo., and Richard Stallings, D-Idaho, are from swing districts
or areas normally dominated by the rival party. Others have been
touched by scandal: Rep. Patrick Swindall, R-Ga., accepted a
questionable loan from a man indicted for money laundering but
later returned the loan; Roy Dyson, D-Md., whose chief of staff
tried to limit the social life of male aides and later committed
suicide; and Bill Chappell, D-Fla., who has been implicated in the
Pentagon procurement scandal.
   Reps. John Hiler, R-Ind., John Miller, R-Wash., and Ron
Marlenee, R-Mont., are facing rematches against tough challengers.
Others considered vulnerable are Reps. Bob Lagomarsino, R-Calif.,
facing state Sen. Gary K. Hart; and Jack Davis, R-Ill., running
against former state Senate president George Sangmeister.
   The Democrats are pouring money and attention into a Georgia
match that pits attorney David Worley against Rep. Newt Gingrich,
the conservative ringleader who filed an ethics complaint against
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   Though Democrats say at this point that they do not expect to
unseat Gingrich, they hope to keep him at home and on the defensive
about his proposal to replace Social Security with a voluntary
system and his ties to his district in light of his role as a
national conservative spokesman.
   Connolly denied that there is any element of retribution in the
focus on Gingrich but added, ``We want to tie him down. He's a
Republican rabble-rouser who we would like to contain in his
congressional district.''
   Women and blacks, with 23 members each in the House, stand to
make incremental gains this year. No black incumbents appear to be
imperiled and a new black lawmaker is sure to be elected from the
Newark seat being vacated by Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J.
   In Washington, which holds a Sept. 20 primary, King County
assessor Ruthe Ridder is competing with black Seattle councilman
Norm Rice for the Democratic nomination in an open, heavily
Democratic district.
   The Democrats are fielding a number of strong women candidates
for open seats and against incumbents. Among them are consumer
activist Rosemary Pooler, trying for an upstate New York seat she
almost won in 1986 from retiring Republican George Wortley; and San
Mateo County Supervisor Anna Eshoo, battling law professor Tom
Campbell for Konnyu's seat south of San Francisco.

<HEAD>Policy to Let Fires Burn Makes Businesses See Red</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GARDINER, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the town meeting in the high school
auditorium dragged into its third hour, with townspeople shifting
on their metal folding chairs, a biologist droning on about the
effects of forest fires on endangered species in Yellowstone
National Park was curtly interrupted.
   ``I think the people here are primarily interested in another
endangered species _ the local businessman,'' boomed Ken Dixon.
``We are also in a survival situation ourselves.''
   In Gardiner, perched just yards from the gateway to Yellowstone,
the lucrative summer season has disappeared in a cloud of
forest-fire smoke. Stores offered end-of-the-season sales and
switched to winter hours before Labor Day. Hotels have lost guests.
Workers have lost wages. In all, merchants reckon they'll lose
millions.
   But townspeople like Dixon, the owner of Cecil's Restaurant,
don't blame the gigantic fires. They blame the National Park
Service, which let the fires burn naturally until they got out of
control.
   ``They've killed our business,'' said Donald Laubach, whose son
owns the Town Cafe and Motel.
   ``We all feel anger toward the park service,'' added cashier
Jackie Thompson.
   When lightning touched off wildfires in June, Yellowstone's
management followed National Park policy and let them burn.
Fire-fighting efforts were launched immediately on manmade fires,
but blazes started by lightning strikes were considered part of the
natural ecosystem and beneficial to the overgrown forest.
   By mid-July, with fires burning in all corners of Yellowstone,
all-out containment efforts began, park officials say. By the end
of August, nearly one-quarter of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres
had been engulfed. At least one of the fires charring Yellowstone
was believed started by chainsaw sparks outside park boundaries,
but it has defied efforts at control.
   The fires _ the worst in more than 200 years _ fed on
drought-dried timber and scattered on record-breaking winds. Today,
they threaten towns, buildings and even the Old Faithful geyser.
   Long after heavy rains or early snows smother the infernos,
debate over the let-it-burn policy will rage, townspeople and park
officials agree.
   Congressional hearings are expected, and application of the
policy will be re-evaluated, said Yellowstone Superintendent Robert
Barbee, the official at whom Dixon and others in the region have
directed their attacks.
   It is shaping up as a classic confrontation, a clash between
businessmen and nature, with its roots sunk deep in the very
mission of national parks, which officials insist are intended to
preserve nature, not cater to tourists.
   ``Where do you draw the line?'' Barbee asked in an interview
with The Associated Press. ``We say when push comes to shove,
nature wins in the national parks. But it isn't pure and simple.''
   Forestry officials say the fires prompt rebirth in the
wilderness, clearing away the old, dead and overgrown while making
way for new vegetation and new wildlife habitats.
   National parks, they say, are intended to be laboratories of
nature, not ``tree museums.''
   ``Are we to promote these lovely pastoral scenes people are used
to seeing on postcards and in coffee table books? Or is a national
park a repository for naturalness?'' Barbee asked. ``Everything
doesn't have to be picture postcard scenes. That's not what we're
trying to accomplish.''
   To Ronnie Wright, the national park fire policy is good in
theory, but poor in practice. Like others living on the edge of the
nation's oldest national park, Wright makes his living from nature.
His company, Beartooth Plateau Outfitters, offers tours and hunting
trips.
   But the only guiding he did in August was getting firefighters
through the forest. His horses carried firefighting gear, not
tourists. When Cooke City, Mont., was under an evacuation warning,
Wright packed up his animals, including his pet bear, and shipped
them out.
   ``They definitely made a mistake. Of course, that's easy to say
with hindsight,'' Wright said. ``The trouble with their policy is
there's no common sense involved. It's so darn dry here, the fires
should have been doused right away.
   ``Their theory is right, but when they've got the means to
control it, they should use their heads a little bit.''
   Barbee says experts studied the fires closely as the early
decisions were made. They relied on 16 years' experience with the
policy, he said, and 100 years of weather data.
   Over the last decade, 140 fires have been allowed to burn, each
consuming an average of only 250 acres. Early this summer, about 20
lightning fires were allowed to burn: 11 died out; nine did not.
   Never before has a summer been so dry, the winds so extreme, he
said. And the fires have done things never seen before _ changing
direction, leaping miles, growing by thousands of acres a day. One
day two side-by-side fires grew in opposite directions _ one north
and one south.
   ``The conditions here are absolutely unprecedented,'' Barbee
said. ``Obviously, if you knew you were going to be in a situation
like this, you'd jump on it.''
   If there has been any saving grace for the merchants, it's that
many are profiting from the fire-fighting efforts. Some are renting
vehicles and horses to the crews. Fire camps offered cleaning and
clerical jobs at $6 an hour. Some fire-fighters have filled a few
of the hotel rooms and restaurant tables.
   But the tension between the two camps only seems to grow,
heightened by the perception that this fire-fighting effort has not
been as effective as others. There have been problems: lack of
radios, lack of manpower, lack of helicopters to make water drops.
   And the primary goal of the effort has been to steer fire away
from buildings. The blazes have been too ferocious for crews to get
in front of and extinguish.
   ``I think there's definitely going to have to be a change, not
only in the fire policy but also in how Yellowstone Park is
managed,'' said Laubach. ``Yellowstone Park has always been treated
as a showcase for the world. Now we'll never see it as it was in
our lifetime.''
   But park officials are trying now to convince the businesses
they can profit from the summer's transformation. When the town
meeting became heated, Barbee told the 100 assembled people the
park service would help them by promoting new interest in the grand
dame of the national parks, which is visited by about 2 million
tourists a year.
   ``We're going to encourage people to come see the aftermath, to
see how the forest reacts,'' Barbee said. ``The park will certainly
have a different face.
   ``I hope the public will find Yellowstone even more interesting
now, not less.''

   Eastern Airlines attorneys have filed an emergency

   Oil futures prices finished weaker in light
trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for October
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, fell 9 cents per barrel Wednesday to close at $15.18.
Other contract months also dropped.
   Near-term contracts for refined petroleum products declined.
Contracts for September delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline
fell 1.49 cents to finish at 46.54 cents a gallon after rising
sharply on Tuesday. Other contracts also slipped.
   Analysts attributed the drop in gasoline futures partly to a
selloff by speculators wanting lower prices in advance of the
contract's expiration. The gasoline contract for September delivery
expired Wednesday.
   ``September gasoline had been a steadying force in the market,''
said Richard Kane, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
``But after today's activity it turned around. It was a function of
liquidating long positions.
   Wholesale heating oil for September fell 0.19 cent to 42.95
cents a gallon while other contract months also fell.
   Analysts said there was little fresh news to stimulate the
market other than a brief spark early in the day brought on by the
weekly API report released late Tuesday.
   The statistics showed a 4.234 million-barrel drawdown in crude
oil stocks for the week ending Aug. 26.
   ``It ostensibly was a good API number for crude. It helped the
market open higher,'' said Fred Demler, an analyst at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. ``But the collapse of the gasoline market and
the sheer weight of the crude market brought it down.''
   After the brief move upward, prices began deteriorating
steadily, led by the drop in gasoline prices. Later in the day,
trading activity slowed considerably, analysts said.

<HEAD>Analysts Believe Delta Can Weather Any Storm Caused By Dallas
Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Financial analysts believe Delta Air Lines Inc.
has built up enough good will in 60 years to withstand any damage
to its reputation caused by its second fatal crash at Dallas in
three years.
   A Boeing 727 crashed on takeoff Wednesday from Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, killing 13 people. On Aug. 5, 1985, a Delta
Lockheed L-1011 crashed in a thunderstorm while trying to land at
the airport, killing 137 people.
   The airline also was beset by a series of unrelated, highly
publicized and embarassing incidents last year: pilots landed at
the wrong airport or on the wrong runway; one plane plummeted
toward the ocean because the pilot mistakenly shut off the engines;
another plane was involved in a near collision over the Atlantic.
   Nevertheless, Delta has maintained its reputation in the
financial community as a sound company and among consumers as a
safe airline.
   ``I don't think the reputation is undeserved,'' and it probably
won't change, said Robert Decker, an airline industry analyst with
Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the airline expects little
long-term damage to its reputation.
   ``The passengers who fly with us, we think they feel very
comfortable,'' Berry said Wednesday. ``The traveling public stayed
with us'' during last year's problems. ``Those passengers who know
Delta don't feel Delta is doing something wrong. If there is
anything that Delta can do, we will do it.''
   Berry noted the airline had flown 119.3 billion passenger miles
since the 1985 accident without a fatality.
   ``If you ask people in airline maintenance who they think does
the best job, Delta's almost always the name mentioned first,''
said John Pincavage, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Delta's common stock dropped $1 when news of the crash hit, but
recovered half of that by the close to finish at $46.50 per share
in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Analysts attributed the stock drop as much to a round of fare
reductions touched off Tuesday by Continental Airlines as to the
crash itself. In addition, transportation issues generally declined
in Big Board trading.
   Anthony Hatch, an analyst in New York with Argus Research,
called Delta ``a terrifically well-run airline.''
   He said Delta survived last year's incidents because ``it had so
much good will in the bank, (and) I don't think they really lost
it.''
   ``These things aren't good for a company, but it's hard to
measure right now'' the final impact, he said, adding that ``people
aren't going to fly Eastern all of a sudden.''
   Eastern Airlines, Delta's chief competitor, has been rocked by
safety investigations of its aircraft and by labor troubles.
Eastern has cut back its routes, although a federal judge this week
blocked its plan to lay off 4,000 employees.
   Delta originated in the South in the 1920s as Huff Daland
Dusters, the world's first cropdusting service, a division of Huff
Daland Manufacturing Co. of Ogdensburg, N.Y.
   Led by Collett Woolman, the service broke away from the parent
company in 1928 to form Delta Air Service with headquarters in
Monroe, La. The first passenger flights took place in 1929,
ironically from Dallas to Jackson, Miss.
   Woolman, who ran the company until his death in 1966, is
credited with setting the tone for Delta, including its unique
tradition of having pilots greet passengers as they disembark.
   The company changed its name in 1930 to Delta Air Corp. and
later to Delta Air Lines Inc., and moved headquarters to Atlanta in
the early '40s. The company returns to Monroe for its annual
meeting.
   Delta's growth was spurred in the early years by the addition of
routes in the South and mergers with other airlines in 1953 and
1972. The biggest step came in 1987, when Delta completed an $860
million merger with Western Airlines Inc., making it the nation's
third largest airline.
   Delta, which operates 385 aircraft and has 55,000 employees,
earned a profit of $306.83 million on $6.92 billion in revenues
during the fiscal year ended June 30.

<HEAD>Carrier Appeals Federal Judge's Order On Layoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, as expected, has asked a federal
appellate court to overturn an injunction stopping it from laying
off 4,000 employees.
   Eastern, in an appeal filed Wednesday with the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, said the proposed layoffs ``were an integral
part of the overall decision to undertake schedule changes and
redeploy other flights.''
   The Miami-based carrier said it was losing several million
dollars per month on employees it does not need. Eastern also noted
the order prohibits the company from transferring what it called
``surplus employees'' to where work is available.
   Spokesman Robin Matell said the 4,000 employees _ hundreds of
them in cities where Eastern sharply reduced operations or ended
all flights Wednesday _ still were being paid.
   But no decision had been made on whether to assign them new
duties while Eastern is fighting for the right to dismiss them.
   ``They are being retained on the payroll. The whole thing is
being interpreted and evaluated, and we just don't have the answers
now,'' Matell said.
   Eastern argues that a federal judge should not be able to
restrict management's ability to make cost-cutting moves it deems
necessary. U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington on
Tuesday ruled Eastern could reduce its flight schedule by 12
percent to save money but could not make mass layoffs without
negotiating them with its unions.
   Among those being retained are 1,500 non-union employees, adding
to confusion over Parker's order. He invoked the Railway Labor Act,
which prevents major changes in contract status quo.
   The opinion did not spell out what should happen to the
employees. Union attorneys suggested they could be transferred, and
leaders of Eastern's three unions said they would like to meet with
management to discuss ways to cut costs without layoffs.
   Union leaders hailed Parker's ruling but agreed it was just
another in a long series of court decisions as the cost-cutting
Texas Air Corp. management, with a carrier $2.5 billion in debt,
goes against combative unions that contend the Houston-based
corporation is cannibalizing its Eastern subsidiary.
   The company and its unions still have myriad court battles under
way, ranging from a union effort to reverse the Texas Air sale and
allow employees to buy Eastern to a company lawsuit charging the
unions have conspired to intentionally damage the airline
financially.
   Still unresolved are contract talks with the Machinists and
pilots. The Machinists, in federal mediation since January, will
vote Sept. 15 on a company call for $161 million in annual wage
concessions.
   Eastern lost $182 million in 1987 and reported $149 million in
losses for the first half of 1988.
   Eastern had announced elimination of 140 flights on July 22, so
no passengers were booked on routes cut Wednesday, including all
service from 14 cities, mostly in the Western United States and
Caribbean.
   Eastern was losing more than $50 million a year at its Kansas
City hub, where low-cost Braniff Airlines has been increasing
business. The hub was eliminated and Eastern cut its Kansas City
daily flights from 53 to six.
   In Kansas City, most of 400 Eastern employees spent Wednesday
catching up on busy work.
   ``We were averaging about 4,800 passengers a day,'' said Walt
Green, Eastern's director of airport services in Kansas City.
``We've got about 500 today.''
   The company had asked employees not to report to work Wednesday
but to take compensation time or stay home without pay while
receiving full company benefits, he said. However, Green said only
about 35 people stayed home Wednesday.
   Most employees spent the day cleaning equipment and storing
supplies, he said.

whites, shows that the nation's economic recovery is not being
evenly shared, the head of a private anti-poverty group said today.
   But an official of a conservative group challenged Census Bureau
figures on the extent of black poverty.
   ``It seems that this is a very uneven economic recovery. The
gains are not being evenly shared...the gap between rich families
and poor families is now wider in this country than at any point in
the past 40 years,'' Robert Greenstein said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   Greenstein, head of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,
commented in the wake of a new Census Bureau report showing that
nearly one-third of all black Americans live in poverty.
   Poverty among blacks climbed 2 percentage points to 33.1 percent
last year, according to the Census Bureau's annual study of income
and poverty released on Wednesday. That means that there were an
estimated 9,683,000 poor blacks as of 1987, which was 700,000 more
than a year earlier.
   ``We do have a great deal of unevenness in our economy and the
people at the bottom, many of them, are being left farther
behind,'' Greenstein said.
   But Stuart Butler of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who
joined Greenstein on the broadcast, challenged the figures.
   If such benefits as food stamps and subsidized housing were
counted, he said, ``you'll find that the poverty level among blacks
is almost half of what the published data suggest.''
   ``Another point that's important to recognize...is that this
so-called expansion of poverty at the lowest end and among blacks
is very largely attributed to the breakup of families,'' Butler
said.
   ``Among the black community, about half the families are headed
by women ... and of course that means that you have families with
one earner or no earners and that heavily pulls down the average
for that whole community.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the increase in
black poverty ``obviously is disappointing,'' but maintained that
the report had good news overall, reporting rising incomes for most
Americans.
   Benjamin Hooks, head of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said he was not surprised at the
findings on black Americans.
   ``We have been saying that this is happening, the poverty rate
among blacks is sliding upward and family income is sliding down,''
Hooks said.
   Greenstein on Wednesday, termed the figures ``most disturbing
... The economic recovery is leaving many poor Americans behind.''
   The news was even worse for black children, noted Greenstein,
whose organization studies the effects of government programs on
the poor.
   The poverty rate for black children aged 18 and under was 45.6
percent last year, up from 43 percent in 1986, the Census report
showed.
   Nearly half, 49.1 percent, of blacks under age 3 lived below the
poverty level in 1987, the study found.
   ``These new data confirm that the 1980s have been a terrible
decade for the poor in America, despite overall progress in
unemployment and the economy,'' said Robert J. Fersh, executive
director of the Food Research and Action Center, a non-profit
organization seeking to alleviate hunger and poverty.
   For Americans overall, the census study said, the poverty rate
was down slightly even though the actual number of poor people
increased. That divergence occurred because the population overall
increased faster than the number of poor.
   The number of persons in poverty totaled 32.5 million in 1987,
slightly higher than the 32.4 million reported for 1986. At the
same time the nation's poverty rate was reported at 13.5 percent,
down from 13.6 percent a year earlier.
   Neither change is considered statistically significant because
they are both within the margin of error of the survey, said
William P. Butz, associate director of the Census Bureau. The
results were based on a sample of about 60,000 households across
the nation and had an error margin of less than one percentage
point.
   The poverty level varies by the size of the family. For 1987 it
was $11,611 for a family of four, up from $11,203 a year earlier.
   Median family income for 1987, the bureau added, was $30,850, up
from $30,534 the year before.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Reached Between WPPSS, Bondholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bondholders who had pursued the Washington Public
Power Supply System through the courts for five years have let
WPPSS off the hook just before trial, claiming ``you can't get
blood out of a turnip.''
   Plaintiff attorneys said the deal with the supply system
announced Wednesday will gain the cooperation of WPPSS employees,
who will be leading witnesses when the securities fraud trial
starts Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz.
   WPPSS agreed this week to settle litigation against it over the
system's $2.25 billion bond default in 1983. The bonds were sold to
finance construction of two nuclear power plants, which were never
completed.
   The trial was moved to Tucson after judges in Seattle excused
themselves because of possible perceived conflicts of interest and
because some feared it would be impossible to get an impartial jury
to hear the case.
   Thousands of people in Washington lost money because of the
default.
   Bondholders agreed to drop claims against WPPSS in return for
access to accounts for the terminated power plants, Nos. 4 and 5,
containing millions of dollars.
   Remaining defendants include 20 public utilities in Washington
and one in Oregon that participated in building the plants, three
engineering firms and a firm that had provided WPPSS with financial
advice.
   The abrupt pullout of WPPSS caught other defendants by surprise,
and one acknowledged consideration was being given to requesting a
trial delay.
   ``We're surprised they (WPPSS) didn't stay and defend their
actions ...,'' said Chuck Shigley, administrator for the Snohomish
County Public Utility District.
   WPPSS paid no money in the tentative settlement, but agreed that
it has an obligation to pay the face value and interest on the
bonds _ which total about $3 billion.
   ``Since you can't get blood out of a turnip, why not get all the
other benefits you can,'' said Mel Weiss, representing class action
plaintiffs in the giant lawsuit.
   However, the agreement noted that because of limited assets
pledged to secure the bonds, there was ``no expectation'' the money
would ever be paid.
   The WPPSS Executive Board was expected to approve the agreement
when it meets Friday in Richland, Wash., in a special meeting, said
Carl Halvorson, board chairman.
   ``It's a very favorable settlement for the supply system,'' he
said.
   The tentative settlement, which also requires the approval of
presiding U.S. District Judge William D. Browning, protects WPPSS'
other assets against any further judgments in the case.
   In the legal action, bondholders sued the supply system, 88
utilities, bond underwriters, various directors and managers,
engineering firms and advisors after WPPSS defaulted on $2.25
billion worth of bonds.
   Many defendants have settled over the past year, including bond
underwriters and more than 60 utilities. They have agreed to pay a
total of $331 million and may face further liabilities.
   The terminated plants are located at the Hanford nuclear
reservation and Satsop, west of Olympia.
   Meanwhile, Browning ruled Wednesday in Tucson that bondholders
are permitted to try to prove they should be fully refunded for the
bonds they bought. Common law and state law permit rescission, or
refund, damages, Browning said in his nine-page order.
   Claims under the federal Securities Act allow only for
out-of-pocket losses, Browning said. That means the difference
between what the bondholder paid and what the value of the bonds
were.
   In both instances, the bondholders will be allowed to try to
prove that because of misrepresentations, they bought bonds that
otherwise would not have been put on the market and therefore
should get full refunds plus interest.

<HEAD>Ask No Action On Georgia Power's Rate Case Pending Fed Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state attorney general asked the Georgia
Public Service Commission to delay action on Georgia Power Co.'s
request for a $735 million rate hike while auditors probe evidence
of possible wrongdoing by the utility.
   The commission on Wednesday ordered a special team to
investigate allegations that utility officials concealed important
information during rate hearings last year. The utility has
requested the rate hike to help finance its share of a big nuclear
generation facility, Plant Vogtle.
   Attorney General Michael Bowers said the Public Service
Commission should take no further action in settling the rate case
until investigators complete their probe.
   The allegations surfaced Tuesday when federal officials released
documents on their investigation of possible tax fraud by the
utility. The documents indicated Georgia Power's parent company,
The Southern Co., and the Big Eight accounting firm of Arthur
Andersen & Co., also are objects of federal scrutiny.
   Among the documents were transcripts of taped conversations
indicating that Georgia Power financial officers may have hidden
records from the commission during hearings the rate increase.
   At one point in the transcript, Gary Givens, Georgia Power's
corporate tax manager, said company officials had ``taken home
floppy discs and things like that related to rate case
information.''
   ``We're concerned about the statement,'' said Commissioner Billy
Lovett. ``Obviously, we don't know what ... (records may have been
taken home). We have a team of auditors and examiners that will
look into every possibility that the commission did not get
complete information in rate cases.''
   Georgia Power Chairman Robert W. Scherer said he was shocked by
the allegations and promised he would ``get to the bottom of this
matter.'' He also vowed he would ``not tolerate the coverup of
wrongdoing at Georgia Power Co.''
   A statement issued by Arthur Andersen from the company's Chicago
headquarters denied wrongdoing.
   The federal investigation, dating back to 1982, involves charges
that the companies and their accountants sought to hide about $61
million in spare parts to avoid paying $50 million in federal
taxes, interest and penalties.
   An account in the The Wall Street Journal today suggested the
federal probe has widened significantly and is focusing on Arthur
Andersen's accounting advice to clients.
   The Journal said the Agriculture Department's inspector general
has subpoenaed documents from 11 major electric cooperatives, all
of which use Arthur Andersen as their auditor.
   The newspaper quoted Bob Bergland, former agriculture secretary
and now general manager of the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association, as saying the subpoenas were issued because of
questions surrounding Arthur Andersen's opinion on the tax
implications of certain leasing arrangements.

   Bargainers for 15,000 garment workers and
several men's clothing manufacturers reached a tentative agreement
this morning on a contract that includes improved wages and health
benefits, a union spokeswoman said.
   The 18-month contract covers members of the Amalgamated Clothing
and Textile Workers Union in a dozen companies across the country,
said the spokeswoman, Jo-Ann Mort.
   The pact is expected to set a pattern for contracts for ACTWU's
other 27,000 members nationwide, she said.
   Jack Sheinkman, president of the union, said wages and health
benefits improved under the new deal, but terms were not disclosed
pending a ratification vote in the next few days.
   The agreement was reached shortly after midnight Wednesday
following a marathon bargaining session, Ms. Mort said.
   Cutters and sewers of men's and boys shirts and men's night wear
currently earn an average of $5.54 an hour, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. The BLS has no wage figures for pants makers.
   The manufacturers, members of the Cotton Garment Allied
Industries Fund, include several big-name makers of men's shirts
and pants including Arrow, Gant and Hathaway.
   The major companies involved in the talks and the locations of
their factories are as follows:
   Jaymar-Ruby of Michigan City, Ind., Elizabethtown, Ky., Rector,
Ark., and Anniston, Ala.
   Hathaway of Waterville, Me.
   Arrow, a subsidiary of Westpoint-Pepperell, of Andalusia,

   The stock market lapsed into a broad decline
today amid renewed worries over the interest-rate outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 10.49 to 2,021.16
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 230 up, 639

market.
   At the same time, U.S. investors were looking ahead warily to
Friday's report from the government on the employment situation for
August.
   There has been some hope lately that the figures would show a
moderation of job growth, thus relieving some pressure for
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   But some analysts noted fears that any surprises when the report
is finally issued could upset the markets.

<HEAD>FDA Advised Not To Regulate `Smokeless' Cigarette, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the Food and Drug Administration are
recommending that the federal agency decline to regulate a
virtually smokeless cigarette being tested by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., a newspaper reported today.
   The Atlanta Constitution, quoting unidentified sources within
the agency, said FDA legal counsel Thomas Scarlett had sent a
confidential report agreeing with the tobacco company's contention
that the cigarette should not be regulated as a drug.
   ``It was a pretty negative report,'' the source told the
Constitution. ``General counsel didn't offer much precedent for our
regulating the product.''
   The decision would be a setback for anti-smoking groups that
have been urging the FDA to treat the cigarette as a drug because
of its nicotine content.
   Two separate petitions were filed in April by the
Washington-based Coalition on Smoking or Health, which represents
the American Heart Association, American Lung Association, American
Cancer Society and the American Medical Association.
   ``Just because you don't see smoke doesn't mean the harmful
effects aren't present,'' said lung association spokeswoman
Michelle R. Kling. ``It's still addictive no matter how you roll it
and how you consume it.''
   The tobacco company, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco
Inc., unveiled the cigarette this week. Dubbed ``Premier,'' it will
be test-marketed in three cities this fall.
   The FDA is not required to rule until late October, and FDA
Commissioner Frank E. Young already has met with representatives of
some medical groups and consumer groups. Meetings are planned
Friday with government agencies.

   The CD ROM format was developed by Philips and Sony. It stands
for compact disk, read-only memory. The format uses compact disks
to record vast amounts of text and pictures.
   But CD ROM's graphics ability is limited to line drawings.
   Sony and Phillips also developed another system, CD-I, for
compact disk-interactive, that has sound and much livelier
graphics. But it won't work on personal computers.
   Microsoft spokesman Collins Hemingway said the aim of the

<HEAD>Brazilian Constitution Limits Interest Rates to 12 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has voted to fix
inflation-adjusted interest rates at 12 percent a year under the
country's new constitution, despite protests from bankers and
businessmen that the measure won't work.
   The 559-member Congress passed the limit late Wednesday in
vaguely worded legislation regarding ``real'' interest rates, which
was interpreted to mean the level of interest charged above the
inflation rate.
   Inflation in the past 12 months totaled 496 percent, but some
banks and financial institutions currently charge more than 1,000
percent annually.
   The measure was sharply criticized by the government and the
business community.
   ``The notion is archaic and obsolete,'' said Rep. Francisco
Dornelles, a former minister of finance, who voted against the
measure.
   Planning Minister Joao Batista de Abreu said Thursday, ``Of
course I didn't like it. It's an unfortunate decision and hurts the
government's monetary policy.''
   Sen. Albano Franco, a prominent businessman and also an opponent
of the measure called it ``absurd. In no other country in the world
are interest rates fixed by the constitution.''
   The financial press also expressed disapproval of the
congressional decision.
   ``Fixing of Interest Rates Creates Crisis,'' read the headline
of the Rio de Janeiro newspaper O Globo on Thursday.
   The Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper said in an editorial the
decision was a product of ``the worst in Brazilian politics:
demagogery, ignorance and unreality.''
   The two-chamber Congress has been working since February 1987 on
the new constitution, Brazil's eighth, to replace an authoritarian
charter handed down 19 years ago during the 1964-1985 military
regime. The new charter is expected to be ready this year.

<HEAD>Poverty Rate For Black Americans Rose Last Year, Survey Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs on second-quarter productivity and July
construction spending; picks up 2nd graf pvs, The report ....</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The productivity of non-farm businesses fell 1.4 percent in the
second quarter, the first drop since 1986 but less than previously
estimated, the Labor Department said today.
   The government had initially put the drop at 1.7 percent, but
revised it downward after deciding that the nation's economic
output in the April-June period had been greater than previously
estimated.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said construction
spending jumped 1.2 percent in July as strength in government
building projects and offices and apartments offset declines in
single-family housing, factories and shopping centers.
   Productivity is a measure of the number of hours of labor
required to achieve a certain output of goods and services. In the
period, employees' hours rose 6.6 percent, greater than the 5.2
percent increase in output.
   Analysts said the increase in hours and conseqent decrease in
productivity reflects a hiring boom in which employers are having
to compete for less-skilled workers because of decade-low
unemployment.
   Measured in dollars, U.S. factories have outperformed the rest
of the world in the past year in reducing labor costs, partly
through the smallest wage increases of any industrial country last
year.
   On Wednesday, the Census Bureau said the proportion of black
Americans living in poverty rose last year to nearly a third. It
said the overall poverty rate was fairly steady.
   The report Wednesday said a survey based on a sample of 60,000
families found that in the nation as a whole, incomes rose 1
percent and the poverty rate edged down. The changes were not
considered statistically significant because they fell within the
survey's margin of possible error.
   The poverty rate for blacks increased to 33.1 percent from 31.1
percent in 1986, the study said, meaning the number of blacks
living in poverty rose from 8.9 million to 9.7 million.
   ``The economic recovery is leaving many poor Americans behind,''
said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a private research group.
   In the financial markets Wednesday, the stock market posted
scattered losses. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished
with a 6.58-point loss at 2,031.65.
   The dollar rose strongly, especially against the Japanese yen,
while interest rates dipped in the bond market.
   According to the Census Bureau report, median family income for
blacks fell to $18,098 from $18,247, while the median income for
white families rose to $32,274 from $31,935.
   The poverty rate for whites dipped to 10.5 percent from 11
percent. For Hispanics the poverty rate rose to 28.2 percent from
27.3 percent.
   The government defined the poverty income level as $11,611 for a
family of four in 1987, up from $11,203 the previous year.
   William P. Butz, the Census Bureau's associate director for
demographic programs, said the nation's ``economic performance, in
terms of income and poverty, has been mixed'' as usual.
   The number of Americans living in poverty last year totaled 32.5
million, slightly higher than the 32.4 million reported for 1986.
The poverty rate was 13.5 percent, down from 13.6 percent.
   It is possible for the poverty rate to decline even when more
people are poor because the size of the population is growing
faster than the number of people living in poverty.
   The study found women's incomes continue to trail those of men.
It said women receive about 65 percent of males' take-home pay, a
percentage that has remained unchanged since 1984.

<TEXT>
   American Stores Inc.'s $2.6 billion
acquisition of Lucky Stores Inc. was approved by federal
regulators, a combination that builds American into one of the
nation's biggest supermarket companies.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who opposed the
deal on grounds it would cut competition and boost prices,
announced he would consider a legal challenge.
   In announcing Wednesday it had won antitrust clearance from the
Federal Trade Commission, American Stores said it would sell 37
California markets to meet commission requirements aimed at keeping
the company from too much control of business in certain areas. The
stores and buyers weren't announced.
   American Stores, which recently moved its corporate headquarters
from Salt Lake City to Orange County, owns 1,600 stores, including
Alpha Beta markets in California, Acme markets on the eastern
seaboard, Skaggs, Scaggs Alpha Beta and Buttery stores in the west,
and the 27-state Osco drugstore chain.
   The addition of Dublin-based Lucky's 480 outlets will put
American's sales in the neighborhood of those at industry leader
Kroger Co. of Cincinnati, and analysts have said it's difficult to
determine which is bigger.
   Approval of the American-Lucky buyout came two days after the
FTC approved another California supermarket combination _ the
purchase of 172 Safeway stores in Southern California by the
190-store Vons chain.
   In August, Van de Kamp filed formal objections to both mergers
with the FTC, citing a statistical study by his office that found
the deals would be bad for consumers.
   American Stores officials were unavailable for comment
Wednesday, after releasing their announcement of the FTC merger
after business hours.
   El Monte-based Vons has denied its purchase would hurt
consumers, and promised to cut prices at the Safeway markets it
bought. The Vons purchase doesn't affect the business of
Oakland-based Safeway outside Southern California.

<HEAD>Aircraft Leasing Business Taking Off</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There's a good chance that the plane you took on
your last flight doesn't belong to the airline whose brightly
colored logo adorns the fuselage.
   Odds are nearly one-in-two, in fact, that the airline leases the
plane from a specialized company or a bank. Aircraft leasing has
taken off in a big way in the past few years, propelled by the
tough economics of airline competition, the aging of the nation's
fleet, tax changes and other factors.
   Almost half of the 2,700 jets operated by U.S. commercial
airlines are leased rather than owned, compared with only 30
percent in 1983, according to industry estimates. Much of that
growth has come in the last two or three years.
   ``There's no real reason that an airline would want to own an
aircraft right now,'' said David Butterworth, a financial analyst
for Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. ``Airlines want the
flexibility (of leasing) and are willing to pay for it.''
   Jet aircraft don't come cheap. A commercial liner made by Boeing
Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. or Lockheed Corp. costs anywhere from
$25 million to $100 million. Big airlines buffeted by the tailwinds
of competition and squeezed by high labor and advertising costs may
well balk at the investment.
   There are plenty of reasons, on the other hand, for carriers to
lease planes.
   The competition sparked by the deregulation of the U.S. airline
industry in 1978 means that carriers have to move nimbly to
establish new hubs, shift their routes and make other changes
requiring new aircraft.
   But the big aircraft manufacturers have a much longer time
horizon _ they need many months to design and build new models and
produce existing ones.
   That's where the leasing companies come in. They fill the gap
between the slow-moving aircraft makers and the pressed airlines by
buying up batches of different kinds of planes and leasing them to
carriers in a pinch.
   ``We're offering airlines flexibility,'' said Steven Udvar-Hazy,
president of International Lease Finance Corp., a major aircraft
leasing company based in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Tax changes also have played a role. As part of the mammoth
federal tax reform of 1986, the investment tax credit was
eliminated for most aircraft purchases, removing an incentive for
many airlines to own a jet.
   And the recent sprouting of scores of new, smaller airlines in
Western Europe with flashy names like Air 2000 and Hispania has
created a new market for jet lessors around the world.
   Leasing companies have been quick to capitalize on the airlines'
hunger for ``short-order'' planes.
   International Lease Finance is widely considered the most
aggressive of the aircraft lessors. It boasts a ``jet portfolio''
of about 60 aircraft worth $2 billion, with another 197 on order.
Among its 70 customers are several major U.S. airlines as well as
foreign carriers, including British Airways, Lufthansa of West
Germany, Scandinavian Airlines System, Singapore Airlines, Garuda
Indonesia and Varig of Brazil.
   Another big U.S. lessor is San Francisco-based GATX Air, a
subsidiary of financial services company GATX Corp. In Europe, the
industry leader is GPA Group Ltd., one of the largest companies in
Ireland, which describes itself as a sort of ``investment banker''
for the aviation industry.
   Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., a huge Australian company that
is half-owned by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, owns eight different
airlines and has an active jet leasing subsidiary.
   These companies specialize in short-term ``operating leases''
running for an average three to seven years, after which the
aircraft are returned to the lessors.
   Major banks and companies like GE Capital (a subsidiary of
General Electric Co.) deal mainly in longer-term ``capital leases''
that work like installment plans. Airlines often end up owning the
planes at the end of the capital lease period.
   Leasing costs vary widely, depending on the age and condition of
the aircraft, how desirable the model is at the time the contract
is signed, and other factors. A $100 million Boeing 747 jumbo jet,
for example, would cost roughly $12 million to $15 million a year
to lease.
   The airlines' need for new planes has been intensified recently
by the aging of the nation's commercial fleet _ caused largely by
lower fuel prices that allowed the carriers to postpone purchases
of more fuel-efficient aircraft.
   The average age of U.S. jetliners is 12.53 years, up 21 percent
from 1979. More than half the jets operated by major carriers are
16 years old or older, according to Avmark Inc., an aviation
consulting firm in Arlington, Va.
   The Delta Air Lines jetliner that crashed Wednesday at the
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport was a 15-year-old Boeing 727. Delta,
which bought that plane in 1973 but now leases 45 percent of its
fleet, says the average age of its aircraft is 8.4 years.
   While the cause of the Aug. 31 crash remains under
investigation, aging aircraft have stirred debate in the industry
since last April, when a 19-year-old Boeing 737 operated by Aloha
Airlines partially disintegrated during a flight over Hawaii. The
pilots managed to land the plane safely, but the accident swept a
flight attendant to her death and injured 61 passengers.
   ``The airlines are realizing now that you pay a price for
hanging on to an aircraft too long,'' said Udvar-Hazy.
   Some big airlines _ and leasing companies _ have been snapping
up new planes voraciously in recent months. On May 16,
International Lease Finance announced that it had made the biggest
commercial aircraft order in history: $5.04 billion for 100 Boeing
jets and 30 Airbus Industrie planes. In addition, the leasing
company took options to purchase another 24 Boeings and 16 jets
made by Airbus, a rival European manufacturer.
   United Airlines and American Airlines, the nation's two largest
carriers, weighed in shortly afterward with big orders of their
own. And a fierce competition reportedly is raging between Boeing
and McDonnell Douglas over an imminent Delta order that could be
worth up to $6 billion.
   To keep on the cutting edge, International Lease Finance and
GATX Air both have placed orders for the ultra-modern Airbus A320,
the first fully computerized commercial plane. Only a handful of
the planes are in commercial service, all of them in Europe.
   While the airline industry clearly is in a replacement cycle _
what one executive calls a ``feeding frenzy'' _ cycles have a way
of turning round. Jet leasing can be risky, and lessors sometimes
have to weather weak markets and avoid the temptation to sell their
planes.
   ``Aircraft leasing can be a very good business if you're patient
and don't panic,'' said Jim Robertson, the president of GATX Air in
San Francisco. ``It's a game for professionals; it's not a game for
dabblers.''
   Robertson speaks from experience: GATX Air has sometimes
acquired stock in airlines and other companies that failed to make
their leasing payments.

<HEAD>Record Number of Visitors Descend On Britain in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record 15.4 million foreign tourists visited
Britain last year, including many more Japanese, Europeans and
North Americans, the government-funded tourist authority said
Thursday.
   The tourists, an 11 percent increase from the year earlier,
spent 6.2 billion pounds, equivalent to $10.4 billion, during the
year, said the British Tourist Authority.
   While the authority did not expect another such record year in
1988 because of a drop in North American tourists, they expected
increased European visits to partly offset the fall.
   The authority said in 1987 visits by Japanese increased 45
percent from 1986, those by Greeks and Italians rose 38 percent,
and Spaniards 24 percent. Visits by Danes and Latin Americans fell
3 percent and 11 percent respectively.
   North American tourists in 1987 increased by 19 percent from the
year before, said the authority, which said Britain was the
fifth-highest tourism-earning nation in the world.
   But the North American influx fell sharply this year according
to separate figures released Wednesday by the Department of
Employment. The number of North American tourists dropped 3 percent
in the first six months of the year compared with the same period
in 1987, the department said.
   Still, tourist authority officials remained cautiously confident.
   ``The North American market is now expected to show only a small
increase on last year but visits from the rest of the world
continue to grow so that overall 1988 will be at least as good as
1987,'' said Michael Medlicott, the authority's chief executive.
   Travel from North America from January through June 1988 fell 3
percent, but Western Europeans increased their trips to Britain by
3 percent, said the employment department.
   The tourist authority said Britain remained fifth in tourism
earnings for a second consecutive year last year, after the United
States, Italy, Spain and France in that order.

   Although many companies and banks lease planes
to airlines, a handful of specialized firms dominate the business
worldwide. The leading players are:
   _INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORP. Based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., the company specializes in short-term operating leases for
aircraft. It has a ``jet portfolio'' of about 60 aircraft worth $2
billion, with another 197 on order. The company has 70 airline
customers, including major U.S. and foreign carriers.
   _GATX AIR. Based in San Francisco, the company is a subsidiary
of financial services company GATX Corp. It has fleet of 52
aircraft, plus 20 advanced Airbus A320s on order. The company has
about 20 airline customers, including nine outside the United
States.
   _GE CAPITAL. Based in Stamford, Conn., the subsidiary of General
Electric Co. deals in leases of every kind, mainly on a long-term
basis similar to an installment plan. It has a subsidiary, Polaris,
which deals in short-term operating leases for used aircraft.
Customer information was not disclosed.
   _GPA GROUP LTD. Based in Shannon, Ireland, this privately held
firm, one of the largest companies in Ireland, specializes in
leasing and other financial services for the aviation industry.
Principle shareholders include Aer Lingus of Ireland, Air Canada,
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Trust & Banking Corp.
and Prudential Insurance Co. of America. The company has a

<HEAD>Pernod Ricard SA Buys 2.8 Percent Stake in Irish Distillers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pernod Ricard SA, a French drinks company, said
Thursday it has bought a 2.8 percent stake in Irish Distillers
Group PLC, the target of a hostile bid by British drinks company
Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Pernod Ricard said last week it was holding talks with Irish
Distillers and that it already had bought a near 1 percent stake in
the Irish whiskey producer, fueling speculation it was considering
a friendly counter-bid.
   Grand Metropolitan has said it will not raise its 253
million-Irish-pound offer, equivalent to $359 million, unless a
third party enters the bidding.
   Under a timetable set by the Britain's Panel on Takeovers and
Mergers, Pernod Ricard has until Monday to decide whether to launch
a rival bid for Irish Distillers.
   Pernod said it purchased 1.14 million Irish Distillers shares on
Wednesday at about $5.90 each.
   Irish Distillers said it would welcome a Pernod Ricard bid.
   ``We've always said we would welcome them as a shareholder, at
whatever level,'' said Irish Distillers spokesman Pat Henegan.
Talks between the two companies are continuing, he said.
   Irish Distillers believes Pernod Ricard will reveal its
intentions either Friday or Monday, he said.
   Pernod Ricard officials declined to comment on when the French
company might make a full disclosure of its plans regarding the
Irish Distillers stake.

   Chinese banks are facing runs on savings deposits
as customers withdraw large amounts of money in panic buying caused
by rising prices and empty stockrooms, the Chinese press reported
today.
   In the southern province of Fujian, savings deposits in
industrial and commercial banks dropped by 57.8 million yuan ($15.6
million) between Aug. 18 and 24, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
   In Shanghai, 100 million yuan ($27 million) was withdrawn in the
past two weeks, the English-language China Daily reported in a
front-page story Wednesday.
   ``People have formed long queues in front of many savings banks
to withdraw their deposits because they fear further devaluation in
the value of their money,'' the paper said.
   People's Bank of China officials in Shanghai called a news
conference this week to refute rumors that a limit had been imposed
on savings withdrawals and assured the public that the bank ``has a
sufficient reserve of money ... to pay off deposits, no matter how
great the amount,'' the report said.
   ``If a depositor wants to withdraw 10,000 yuan ($2,702) at once,
we will pay him immediately,'' Zhou Zhishi, vice president of the
Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, China's central
bank, said.
   In Fujian, one customer took out 70,000 yuan ($18,919) in one
shot, Xinhua reported.
   The average urban worker's monthly salary is about 130 yuan
($35).
   Meanwhile, the daily sales volume of household electric
appliances such as televisions, refrigerators and washing machines
has doubled or tripled in Fujian, the news agency said.
   The panic buying has caused shortages in previously overstocked
goods such as cassette recorders, electric fans, bicycles and
pressure cookers, the report said.
   The bank runs and panic buying are caused by growing alarm among
Chinese consumers over dramatic price hikes and fears of
devaluation of their money.
   In the past year, prices have increased 19 percent in a country
that once boasted zero inflation.
   The interest rate, which was raised today from 7.2 percent for
one-year deposits to 8.64 percent, still falls far short of
inflation.
   The result is ``the popular concept that buying goods is better
than depositing money,'' Xinhua reported.
   The State Council, China's cabinet, issued a statement this week
promising to slow down the pace of the reforms that have caused
run-away inflation.
   The State Council agreed to hold prices in check for the rest of
the year and decided there will be no radical reforms in prices
next year.
   In mid-August, the Communist Party Politburo called for rapid
decontrol of state-set prices that would allow the value of goods
to be determined by market forces. The State Council also suggested
that interest rates would be raised next year to meet or even
surpass the inflation rate.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Higher On Talk of Soviet Buying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened higher today on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors that the Soviet Union made
some large corn purchases overnight, analysts said.
   The Soviets were said to have purchased 1 million to 1.5 million
metric tons of U.S. corn and another 500,000 metric tons of corn
from Argentina.
   Talk of a soybean meal purchase by the Soviets gave an
additional boost to soybean futures prices.
   Analysts have been expecting a resurgence of Soviet buying on
world grain markets.
   ``All of a sudden they're out there just buying the world up,''
said Jerry Gidel, a grain market analyst in Chicago with the G.H.
Miller division of British-owned LIT America Inc. ``The excitement
about the whole thing has got the market fired up.''
   The buying rumors apparently are being fueled by anticipation of
the end of talks between Washington and Moscow about renewing a
huge grain agreement under which the Soviets would buy millions of
tons of wheat, corn, soybeans and soybean meal.
   In early trading, wheat was 2{ cents to 4{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.01{ a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 8 cents higher with corn at $2.91 a bushel; oats were 4{
cents to 5{ cents higher with September at $2.61\ a bushel;
soybeans were 5} cents to 15{ cents higher with September at $8.70
a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .28 cent lower with October at
71.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to .70 cent lower
with September at 81.30 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to
.40 cent higher with October at 38.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .32 cent lower to .40 cent higher with February at 49
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Wednesday.

   Stock prices suffered a broad setback today amid
renewed worries over the interest-rate outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 30.05 to 2,001.60
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 234 up,
1,120 down and 446 unchanged.
   Analysts said concern was spreading among traders that a rising
dollar in foreign exchange would prompt Japanese officials to
increase interest rates. Prices fell sharply in the Tokyo stock
market.
   At the same time, U.S. investors were looking ahead warily to
Friday's report from the government on the employment situation for
August.
   There has been some hope lately that the figures would show a
moderation of job growth, thus relieving some pressure for
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   But some analysts noted fears that any surprises when the report
is finally issued could upset the markets.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1{ at 110; Exxon, down | at 45~; American Telephone
& Telegraph, down { at 24]; General Electric, down } at 39|, and
Ford Motor, down ~ at 48].
   Retailing stocks dropped as traders registered their lack of
enthusiasm for industry sales figures for August. J.C. Penney lost
1[ to 45[; Wal-Mart Stores | to 29]; Sears Roebuck { to 35, and K

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.96 to 146.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market

<HEAD>American Airlines Files Lawsuits on Frequent Flier Program</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   FORT WORTH _ American Airlines says it hopes lawsuits it filed
in three cities against individuals and companies will help end
alleged abuses of the airline's frequent flier program.
   ``We simply cannot tolerate this situation,'' said Lowell
Duncan, a spokesman for American, the nation's second-largest
airline. He said more lawsuits may be filed.
   American's frequent flier program, called AAdvantage, stipulates
that customers earning free flights and other benefits cannot sell
their tickets to others. Members of the program may give awards to
anyone they choose, but the airline has repeatedly reminded people
that the awards can not be sold, purchased or bartered.
   Most major U.S. airlines have the same requirement in their
frequent flier programs.
   American filed the lawsuits Wednesday in Fort Worth against
Texas Traveller, in Salt Lake City against Platinum World Travel
and The Coupon Connection; and in New York against American Coupon
Exchange. The companies do major business in buying awards from
frequent fliers and selling them to others.
   In all three suits, American has asked for an injunction to stop
the defendants from purchasing, selling, bartering or brokering
AAdvantage frequent flier bonus coupons.
   American filed a similar lawsuit Tuesday in Fort Worth against
Texas Budget Flights and the travel agency's owners, Curtis R.
Sweeten and Tonya K. Sweeten, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.
   ``We have an obligation to our AAdvantage members who do abide
by the rules and to our paying customers to put a stop to the
practice,'' Duncan said. He said the complaints allege that
millions of dollars in revenue are being lost from the sale and
barter of AAdvantage awards.

   The dollar steadied against major currencies in
quiet European trading Thursday, a day before the release of
potentially market-moving data on U.S. employment.
   Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said traders were reluctant to take a
speculative position in the dollar before the August U.S. jobless
data scheduled for release Friday morning.
   They said the data was expected to show little change from
July's 5.4 percent rate, but a surprise could have an impact on the
dollar.
   The monthly jobless figures generally are regarded as one of the
most sensitive indicators of the U.S. economy's growth. Lower
unemployment implies higher growth, hence accelerating inflation
and higher interest rates.
   Anticipation of a long holiday weekend in the United States also
made market trading thin, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar jumped 1.73 yen to a closing 136.70. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 136.60 yen.
   The British pound fell in London to $1.6730, compared with
$1.6830 Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Wednesday included:
1.8795 West German marks, up from 1.8780; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up

   Stocks finished a rough session broadly lower
Thursday, dragged down by declining Wall Street prices and concerns
that British interest rates may have to rise to curb consumer
spending.
   Earlier in the day, dealers on the London Stock Exchange
reported subdued trading activity after opening selling pressure,
but late afternoon large-scale selling reemerged as sentiment
remained cautious and nervous.
   Equities have been under pressure since last week's news of a
sharply wider British trade deficit in July and a subsequent rise
in bank base lending rates to 12 percent from 11 percent.
   The Financial Times 100-share index finished down 23.1 points,
or 1.32 percent, at 1730.5.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 31.65 points as London
trading subsided, with much of New York's weakness related to the
impact of computerized selling strategies. Tokyo's fall Thursday,
where the Nikkei index plunged 431.69 points to 26,934.26, unnerved
market players over the direction of interest rates.
   Several dealers said they are convinced that British interest
rates will have to go higher following the news of last week's
record 2.15 billion-pound trade deficit.
   Early news from the Far East markets merely added to the
impression that there was no reason to commit money to equities,
dealers said.

   Cadbury Schweppes PLC, a British soft drinks and
confectionery group, on Thursday said its pretax profits jumped 28
percent to 81.7 million pounds, or about $137 million, in the first
half of the year.
   In the year-ago period, the company reported pretax profits of
63.6 million pounds, or $107 million.
   Profits after taxes and minority interests but before
extraordinary items rose 37 percent in the first six months to 53.5
million pound, from 38.8 million pounds.
   Revenue during the period rose 14 percent to 1.06 billion pounds
from 932.9 million pounds in the year-ago period.
   Cadbury, maker of Peter Paul candy bars, recently announced the
sale of its U.S. confectionery operations to Hershey Foods Corp. in
a $300 million deal.
   General Cinema Corp., a Chestnut Hill, Mass.-based concern with
interests in movie theaters and soft drink bottling, has built up a
18.4 percent stake in Cadbury and may be interested in its drinks
business.

<HEAD>Hershey Unveils New Powdered Chocolate Mix</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH KIRKPATRICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hershey Foods Corp., trying to use its well
known name to capture the No. 2 position in the powdered chocolate
mix market, announced a new product Thursday that the company is
shipping to stores.
   Anthony Pingitore, general manager of Hershey's Grocery Products
Group, said Hershey's Chocolate Milk Mix scored highly in consumer
trials during its 3{ years of development.
   Earlier this summer, Hershey withdrew its 32-year-old entry in
the $200 million a year powdered chocolate market, Hershey's
Instant.
   Pingitore said the company set out in 1985 to find a mix that
would taste better and dissolve more easily in milk.
   ``This has plagued consumers for years, although they were
really satisfied with the market leader's product,'' he said of
flavor and solubility. ``We decided we would tackle the problem ...
We think we have it.''
   Hershey plans a massive television and direct mail advertising
campaign, although Pingitore would not say how much will be spent.
Nearly 50 million discount coupons for the mix will be distributed
in Sunday newspapers across the nation on Sept. 18.
   Pingitore said the company will be happy if the new mix becomes
a solid No. 2 behind industry leader Nestle's Quik. He said
consumer trials indicated Hershey's name was a significant element
in sales. The Hershey container will have a wider mouth and a
recloseable lid, he said.
   ``The leading competitor has obviously a very strong brand
franchise, which is not easy to overcome,'' Pingitore said. ``It's
akin to the franchise we have with the Hershey bar.''
   Nestle dominates the so-called milk modifier industry, with a 23
percent share, said John McMillin, a food industry analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. Hershey has about 12
percent of the market and its volume was down about 2 percent last
year, while Nestle's was up about 2 percent, McMillin said.
   ``Hershey has some catching up to do,'' he said.
   He added that Hershey, with 1987 earnings of $148.2 million on
sales of $2.4 billion, has been more aggressive within the last
year.
   Pingitore said the company's three pillars for growth are its
established products, acquisitions and new product development,
including a heavy emphasis on gauging what consumers want in snacks.
   Hershey announced on Aug. 8 the sale of its Friendly Ice Cream
restaurant chain to Tennessee Restaurant Co. for $375 million.
   Hershey also recently said it was buying the U.S. confectionery
operations of Cadbury-Schweppes PLC of England for $270 million
plus the assumption of $30 million in debt.
   ``It's been a back to basics year for Hershey,'' McMillin said.
``They've made a number of confectionery acquisitions. They're
focusing more on what they do best and that is tied closely to
chocolate.''

<HEAD>Moscom Inc.: Keeping Track of All Those Personal Calls</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto ROC1 of Aug. 30</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to keeping tabs on
personal calls made from the office, Albert Montevecchio has no
problem with the privacy issue.
   ``When it's my money you're spending, I have every right in the
world to know how you're spending it,'' said the founder and
president of Moscom Inc., the world's leading supplier of call
accounting computer systems.
   If someone is calling a friend who works across town five times
a day, or making long-distance calls to relatives, the company will
be able to find out. The systems won't let anyone listen in on
calls.
   ``All it does is tell the boss who you called, how long you
spoke and how much it cost, which seems like it's fair
information,'' said Rob Boxer, the company's corporate counsel.
   ``One guy we sold a system to said, `You know, before I bought
your product every time I looked at a phone on someone's desk it
looked like a blank check,''' said Boxer.
   The systems consist of software for personal computers and a
cable connecting the PC to the phone system. An older, less
flexible version uses a printer instead of a personal computer.
   Many companies that install the systems don't use them to check
up on employees, and others may only track calls that exceed $10,
Boxer said, but he acknowledged the potential for ``going
overboard'' does exist.
   That's exactly what most workers fear, according to Elaine
Eisenman, an industrial psychologist and a consultant for the
Chicago management consulting firm of Rohrer, Hibler and Replogle.
   ``What it really comes down to is what is the definition of
personal privacy in the work place and can there be any,'' she
said. ``How many rights are you expected to give up when you show
up for work?''
   The answer is pretty simple for Montevecchio, who believes too
much fuss is being made over employee privacy.
   ``We use it here and we don't have people revolting,'' he said.
   The real appeal of a call accounting system is that it gives
executives a comprehensive look at their telephone bill, which in
some companies could be $300,000 a month, Montevecchio said.
   Are workers using ordinary phone lines instead of low-cost WATS
lines? Are there a number of charges for hang-ups indicating bad
connections? Should more trunk lines be added to avoid repeated
busy signals?
   ``When deregulation hit, it forced a lot of major corporations
and even medium-sized companies to become their own telephone
company,'' Montevecchio said. ``This is the biggest non-controlled
expense they have and they're crying for tools to help them manage
their telecommunications.''
   Last year, Moscom sold more than 5,000 call accounting systems
in this country and in Europe, mostly as a supplier to big names in
the telephone industry like American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and
Siemens AG of West Germany.
   Moscom estimates about 15,000 of its call accounting systems are
in use around the world. The ones for PCs cost $1,300 to $4,500,
depending on the number of phone lines covered. The older versions
are $2,500 to $7,500.
   The 5-year-old telecommunications company, based in East
Rochester, has enjoyed two years of growing sales and profits after
nearly being forced out of business by a sudden development in the
rapidly changing telephone industry.
   Everything looked rosy when Moscom successfully courted AT&T as
a customer and was shipping hundreds of call accounting systems a
month to the telephone giant.
   But then, in 1985, Moscom learned that AT&T planned to offer a
line of personal computers and hoped to sell software for them that
would perform an array of services, including call accounting.
   Moscom had no computer software that would do call accounting.
All it had was the computerized hardware unit.
   ``We saw the handwriting on the wall,'' said Boxer.
   In a wildly frantic six months, while sales were dropping by
nearly 50 percent, the company and a consulting firm came up with a
computer software product that could run on virtually any personal
computer.
   ``There were a lot of times when all of us had doubts whether we
were going to be able to make it or not,'' said Montevecchio.
``Because going from where we were to where we had to be was a
chore that a lot of us didn't relish, but we had to do it.''
   Today, 60 percent of the company's sales are in computer
software and growing. Most of the hardware sales are made in
Europe, said Boxer, where the company's initial products are still
popular.
   Moscom, which lost $7 million in its first four years of
business, finally turned a profit of nearly $1 million in 1987.
   Business continues to improve. In its most recent fiscal
quarter, which ended June 30, the company's profits were up 171
percent at $480,000 on sales of $2.5 million. The over-the-counter
stock is up to $3 or $4 a share from $1.87{ at the end of 1987.
   This year the company has also started to market its first
product using the Moscom name. The Moscom ``MaxNet'' not only does
call accounting but also keeps track of billing and out-of-service
alarms and provides directory assistance.

   Grain and soybean futures closed higher Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade on persistent rumors that the Soviet
Union had purchased at least 1 million metric tons of U.S. corn.
   The Soviets also were said to have bought 500,000 metric tons of
corn from Argentina and an undetermined amount of U.S. soybean
meal, analysts said. Corn and soybean meal can both be used as
cattle feed.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.
   Analysts have been expecting a resurgence of Soviet buying on
world grain markets.
   ``The rumors continue to be optimistic about Soviet purchases _
there's a general feeling of optimism there,'' said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst in Chicago with the G.H. Miller division of British-owned
LIT America Inc.
   Prices opened higher and remained near their opening levels
throughout the session.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.00{ a bushel; corn was 2

<HEAD>San Diego Utility Rejects $2 Billion Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Diego Gas & Electric Co. on Thursday
rejected an unsolicited $2 billion takeover offer from the parent
of Southern California Edison, saying it preferred to merge with
Tucson (Ariz.) Electric Power Co.
   Tom Paige, a senior executive of the San Diego utility, said its
long-term interests and its customers would be better served by the
Tucson deal, which would match the Tucson company's excess
generating capacity with SDG&E's burgeoning customer base.
   Paige vowed that San Diego customers, whose electric bills are
among the highest in the nation, would see rate cuts as a result of
the proposed Tucson merger.
   ``The board has decided SDG&E should remain an independent
company pursuing its strategic goals and controlling its own
destiny,'' Paige said in a news release following a meeting with
officials of SCE Corp., parent of the huge Southern California
Edison Co.
   Edison boosted its bid by $50 million just Wednesday, bringing
the value of the stock-swap proposal to approximately $2.15
billion, and Edison officals angrily denounced the rejection,
saying their offer would remain in effect.
   ``It is unbelievable that SDG&E's management and board of
directors turned down SCEcorp's offer,'' said Howard P. Allen,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   He suggested SCE would continue to press its offer when state
regulators are asked to approve the Tucson merger.
   An acquisition by Edison, which serves most of Southern
California and parts of central California, would have created the
nation's biggest electrical utility, with 4.8 million customers and
a 54,000-square-mile territory.
   Edison maintained the acquisition made more sense than the
Tucson deal because the company's service areas adjoin and because
Edison has access to vast amounts of power generated throughout the
West.
   Edison also vowed to cut SDG&E customers' rates by 10 percent.
Paige said he was skeptical that could be done.
   The Tucson deal would involve an exchange of some $1.9 billion
worth of stock and leave SDG&E the surviving company.
   SDG&E officials have said previously the deal made sense because
of Tucson Electric's excess generating capcity. SDG&E produces
relatively little power, choosing instead to buy it from other
utilities.
   SDG&E serves one of the state's fastest-growing areas, northern
San Diego County, and would provide a ready market for Tucson
Electric's power.
   Edison's latest offer would give SDG&E shareholders 1.225 shares
of stock instead of the 1.2 shares of Edison made in an offer Aug.
19 and the 1.15 shares in the initial bid.

<HEAD>Big Blue Wines May Ruffle Feathers at IBM</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jack Ransom thinks his new Big Blue wine
is ``user friendly,'' but his old employer _ International Business
Machines Corp. _ isn't so sure.
   Ransom's product has everything _ and nothing _ to do with IBM,
which has long borne the corporate nickname Big Blue.
   Ransom, who left IBM in 1969, takes obvious delight in what he
calls a joking marketing strategy for wines now available in
several parts of New York state where there are large
concentrations of IBM workers.
   ``To have the audacity to put their name on a wine label gives
us an enormous amount of pleasure,'' said Ransom, who worked for 16
years at IBM starting in 1953.
   But IBM doesn't seem too pleased. The company first tried to
ignore it by saying it had no formal connection to the name Big
Blue. This week, the giant changed its tune.
   ``We have some concerns, mainly because of infringement on a
trademark,'' said IBM spokeswoman Rita Black at the Armonk, N.Y.,
headquarters. ``It's conceivable that there may be some
infringement because IBM has a product itself called Big Blue. It's
a typewriter ribbon.''
   The second area of concern centers around the Big Blue label,
which uses bar lettering similar to the letter style used in IBM's
corporate logo, Black said. ``That logo and its design we want to
protect.''
   ``At this moment basically we're looking at it. If it's
necessary we'll take some appropriate actions,'' Black said.
   ``Frankly I'm surprised,'' said Ransom, who said he found the
inspiration for the new label in a club of ex-IBMers that goes by
the same name _ Big Blue.
   The club was incorporated in Texas last year by Thomas Spain of
Stamford, Conn. Ransom said he got the idea after a call from Spain
asking him to join the club. A small percentage of the sales is
donated to the club.
   ``A little controversy doesn't hurt as long as it doesn't come
to anything,'' Ransom said. ``It's hard for me to believe that IBM
could do anything.''
   Both Ransom and Spain are emphatic about their love for their
former employer.
   ``There is a strong respect and deep abiding, almost love, for
IBM (in the club),'' Spain said. ``IBM is a culture and we are all
products of this culture.''
   While IBM isn't impressed with Ransom's marketing strategy, his
tactics have been viewed as genius by others who say the biggest
problem with New York wines is that nobody knows about them.
   ``I think it's terrific,'' said James Trezise, of the New York
Wine Grape Association. ``It's an ideal example of niche
marketing.''
   Ransom two years ago bought the Chateau Georges winery about 80
miles north of New York City in the Hudson Valley, so it was a
perfect fit for the club to have its own wine.
   It went on sale this July and what began as tongue-in-cheek fun
surpassed Ransom's wildest expectations. He sold 800 cases in one
month, a supply he had thought would last six months.
   While he created and started a number of businesses with his own
firm, Capital Structures Inc., Ransom says the only one he ever
wanted to run himself is the winery, which produced 25,000 gallons
of wine last year. Ransom hopes to double output this year.
   Big Blue offers Compatible White, at $6.75, Interface blush, $6,
and Homestead Red, at $7.50, are among 13 other premium wines
Ransom's wine company, Rivendell, is selling this year.

   H.J. Heinz Co. said Thursday its earnings rose
13.3 percent in the first quarter, helped by improved sales and
continuing cost-reduction efforts.
   For the three-month period ended July 27, the giant foodmaker
reported after-tax profit of $110 million, or 84 cents a share, up
from $97.2 million, or 73 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   ``We are encouraged by the first-quarter results. They establish
a solid base which should enable us to achieve fiscal year growth
consistent with historical trends,'' Heinz Chairman Anthony J.F.
O'Reilly said.
   The company's revenue rose 10.6 percent in the first quarter to
$1.4 billion, from $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 1987.
   Heinz said currency exchange rates and price increases
contributed to the higher sales figures.
   The company cited excellent volume increases in Italy and the
United Kingdom and noted continued strong growth in Weight Watchers
products and healthy gains in pet foods.

   Stock prices fell today amid renewed worries
over the interest-rate outlook.
   Analysts said concern was spreading among traders that a rising
dollar in foreign exchange would prompt Japanese officials to
increase interest rates. Prices fell sharply in the Tokyo stock
market.
   At the same time, U.S. investors were looking ahead warily to
Friday's report from the government on the employment situation for
August.
   There has been some hope lately that the figures would show a
moderation of job growth, thus relieving some pressure for
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   But some analysts noted fears that any surprises when the report
is finally issued could upset the markets.

   Assets of the nation's 449 money market mutual
funds fell $2.01 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $267.04 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $369.2 million increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 221 general purpose funds fell $333.8 million to $85.04
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $1.04 billion to
$112.96 billion, and assets of 126 institutional funds fell $637.6
million to $69.04 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.27 percent from 7.22 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.14 percent from 7.06 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
33 days, the same as the week before, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.94 percent as of Wednesday from 5.92 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.12 percent from 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.64
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.58 the
previous week. Yields were 7.96 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.89
percent; 8.23 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.18 percent; and
8.54 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.50 percent.

   A plunge in stock prices on the Tokyo market
rippled through London and New York on Thursday as investors
worried about inflation and rising global interest rates.
   The decline in Tokyo's high-flying market was the third biggest
of 1988 and contributed to a 29.34-point decline in the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks to 2,002.31.
   Drops in key market indexes amounted to 1.6 percent in Tokyo,
1.3 percent in London and 1.4 percent in New York. Meanwhile, the
dollar leveled off from its recent rise and bond prices were little
changed.
   The world's central banks have been raising interest rates to
keep their economies from overheating. The higher rates tend to
siphon money away from stocks into interest-bearing investments
such as government bonds.
   Economists are divided over whether the world economy is running
so hard that there is a risk of runaway prices.
   ``I don't see the inflation pressure and the wage pressure that
the markets are worried about,'' Aubrey H. Zaffuto, an economist at
IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Co. in New York, said Thursday.
   The bond market is usually the canary in the coal mine when it
comes to reacting to whiffs of inflation and rising rates, but in a
switch, bonds held up fairly well while stocks were sliding.
   ``The bond market seems to be holding in like a rock, so why the
equity market is jittery I don't know,'' Ms. Zaffuto said.
   The Japanese yen fell against the dollar to its lowest point in
nine months on Wednesday after the Bank of Japan said it did not
intend to raise its discount rate, a key rate charged on loans to
banks.
   When Japanese stocks plunged Thursday, some analysts said it was
partly because investors decided after the yen's drop that the Bank
of Japan would be forced to raise the discount rate after all.
   Higher rates could prick the bubble of high Japanese stock
prices, which would be particularly unwelcome at a time when the
government is trying to ensure a high sales price for its huge
offering of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
   Japan's low inflation rate takes off pressure to raise rates.
For one thing, it means the central bank can tolerate a decline in
the yen without worrying that it will raise import prices and push
up the general price level.
   However, Japan is supposed to help keep currency rates roughly
stable as part of the agreement of the Group of Seven major
industrial democracies.
   The Bank of Japan might intervene to sell dollars or raise
domestic rates if the dollar climbs to 138 or 140 yen from its
current level of a little more than 136 yen, said David Resler,
chief financial economist of Nomura Securities International Inc.
in New York.
   ``They're not ready to use their ammunition yet,'' he said.
   U.S. officials have seemed willing to tolerate a rise in the
dollar because dollar strength helps hold down inflation and
interest rates. But in the long run _ after the November elections
_ the strength of the dollar could worsen the trade deficit by
making American products more expensive in world markets.
   Some traders and analysts expressed anxiety that the government
would report on Friday a drop in the unemployment rate, a sign that
the economy could be growing too rapidly.
   In that case, the Federal Reserve might be convinced to take the
politically unpopular step of raising rates again before the
election to cool off a ``boom stage'' economy, said Edward J.
Campbell, a senior economist for Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.
   But Ms. Zaffuto said that seemed unlikely, or at least
unjustified.
   ``I don't think rates in the United States have to go up any
more for domestic considerations,'' she said.

   Paul E. Wright, who was instrumental
in the merger of RCA Corp. into General Electric, was elected
chairman of Chrysler Technologies on Thursday.
   The Washington D.C.-based Chrysler Technologies, which includes
Gulfstream Aerospace and Electrospace Systems Inc., is one of three
operating units of Chrysler Corp.
   Wright, 57, served until June as president and chief operating
officer of Fairchild Industries Inc., a defense contractor. Before
that, he spent 28 years with RCA, where he was vice president and
general manager of RCA's Aerospace and Defense Group. During the
four years Wright headed the division, sales doubled from $700
million to $1.4 billion.
   He was a senior vice president responsible for strategic
planning during the merger of RCA into General Electric.
   ``We looked long and hard for the kind of person who could
manage, lead and expand our aerospace and defense businesses,''
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said. ``Paul's experience and record
of achievement make him the perfect choice.''

   The stock market took a spill Thursday as
traders waited warily for the latest government report on the
employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 29.34 points to
2,002.31, trading briefly below 2,000 at its lowest levels of the
day.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
374 up, 1,072 down and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 144.09 million
shares, against 130.48 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 165.60 million shares.
   Analysts said concern was spreading among traders that a rising
dollar in foreign exchange would prompt Japanese officials to
increase interest rates. Prices fell sharply in the Tokyo stock
market.
   At the same time, U.S. investors were looking ahead warily to
Friday's report from the Labor Department on the employment
situation for August.
   There has been some hope lately that the figures would show a
moderation of job growth, thus relieving some pressure for
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   But some analysts noted fears that any surprises in the report
could upset the markets.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street generally call for an
unemployment rate of 5.4 percent, unchanged from July, and at least
a modest slowing in the growth of payroll employment.
   Losers among the blue chips Thursday included International
Business Machines, down 1\ at 110\; Exxon, down | at 45~; American
Telephone & Telegraph, down { at 24]; General Electric, down { at
39~, and General Motors, down 1 at 71~.
   Retailing stocks dropped as traders registered their lack of
enthusiasm for industry sales figures for August. J.C. Penney lost
1[ to 45[; Sears Roebuck { to 35, and Wal-Mart Stores \ to 29}.
   Digital Communications Associates was the day's biggest
percentage loser among NYSE stocks, tumbling 4] to 21[. Late
Wednesday the company said its revenues for the current fiscal
quarter might be down 15 percent to 20 percent from the quarter
ended June 30.
   Technology issues traded in the over-the-counter market were
broadly lower. Intel fell 1\ to 26}; Apple Computer 1 to 38~;
Microsoft 1[ to 48~; Ashton-Tate | to 23[, and Sun Microsystems ~
to 37}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $27.04 billion, or 1.03
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.61 to 146.68.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 3.70 to 296.35, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.17 at 258.35.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 3.59 to 372.96. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 293.18, down 1.62.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Aug. 22, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,033.6 billion in that week from $3,027.8 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,830.8 billion from $3,824.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $783.4 billion from $780.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $1.118 billion
in the week ended Aug. 24, compared with a decline of $1.163
billion a week ago.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $645 million, up from $592 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $281.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $280.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Continue To Rally On Foreign Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures gained moderately Thursday for the
third straight day on the Chicago Board of Trade because of what
brokers called real and rumored improvements in foreign demand.
   On other markets, sugar futures were sharply higher; stock-index
futures fell; energy, precious metals and livestock and meat
futures all were mixed.
   Corn and soybeans led the crop futures higher on persistent
rumors of large overnight purchases by the Soviet Union, analysts
said.
   The Soviets were said to have bought 1 million metric tons of
U.S. corn, 500,000 metric tons of Argentine corn and an
undetermined amount of U.S. soybean meal, analysts said. Corn and
soybean meal can be used as cattle feed.
   After Thursday's close, the Agriculture Department reported that
private exporters had sold 100,000 metric tons of corn to the
Soviets and more than 250,000 metric tons of corn to unknown
destinations.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and equals 39.4 bushels of
corn.
   Analysts have been expecting a resurgence of Soviet buying on
world grain markets.
   ``The rumors continue to be optimistic about Soviet purchases _
there's a general feeling of optimism there,'' said Jerry Gidel, an
analyst in Chicago with the G.H. Miller division of British-owned
LIT America Inc.
   Prices opened higher and remained near their opening levels
until shortly before the close, when they retreated slightly on
profit-taking. Wheat steadied on late news of a new Chinese bid for
U.S. wheat under the USDA's export enhancement program.
   Wheat settled { cent to 3 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.99} a bushel; corn was } cent lower to
6 cents higher with September at $2.89 a bushel; oats were 3} cents
to 6 cents higher with September at $2.60\ a bushel; soybeans were
1 cent lower to 14{ cents higher with September at $8.69 a bushel.
   Sugar futures soared while cocoa futures fell sharply on New
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
   The sugar rally primarily stemmed from internal market supply
and demand. But prices also advanced on rumors, later denied, of
Chinese buying, as well as the price gains in grain.
   ``The grains were up today and maybe they were in tandem, in
lockstep to some degree,'' said Judith Ganes, an analyst in New
York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Sugar was .31 cent to .84 cents higher with October at 10.64
cents a pound.
   The continued weakening of cocoa futures reflected growing
pessimism about the survival of the International Cocoa
Organization and its price-support efforts in the face of huge
cocoa surpluses.
   Cocoa settled $33 to $47 lower with September at $1,187 a metric
ton, a 12{-year low.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
in reaction to a sharp decline in the Japanese stock market and
weak bond markets, analysts said.
   The contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
stock index settled 2.80 points lower at 258.80.
   Energy futures finished mixed in extremely light, directionless
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 12 cents
lower with October at $15.08 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent
lower to .14 cent higher with October at 43.46 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .27 cent lower to .36 cent higher with
October at 44.71 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures ended modestly lower while silver advanced slightly
in a quiet session on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $1.20 lower across the board with October at
$432.90 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 2.5 cents higher with
September at $6.574 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures prices fell on mostly technical factors while
pork futures advanced after three days of sharply lower prices.
   ``I think they're just taking a breather, to tell you the
truth,'' said Michael Murphy, livestock market analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .67 cent lower with October at
71.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .65 cent to 1.03 cents
lower with September at 81.05 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to
.68 cent higher with October at 38.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .25 cent higher with February at 49.07
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   The dollar eased against most key currencies
Thursday in quiet U.S. trading, reflecting reluctance by money
brokers to speculate ahead of a market-moving unemployment report
and the long Labor Day weekend.
   Gold prices fell slightly in New York after rising abroad.
Republic National Bank quoted bullion at $429.75 a troy ounce as of
4 p.m. EDT, vs. $430.30 late Wednesday.
   The dollar's mild decline in the United States came after it
steadied in Europe and rose sharply in Japan, a carryover from the
U.S. currency's large advance on Wednesday, when the Bank of Japan
suggested it would limit domestic interest rate increases. That
news had sent the Japanese yen plunging.
   Foreign exchange analysts attributed the dollar's behavior
Thursday to money traders who sold the currency to reduce their
speculative positions, given the uncertainty over the impact of a
government report scheduled for Friday on August unemployment.
   The Labor Department's monthly jobless reports are considered
sensitive signals of the U.S. economy's health. Low unemployment
implies faster growth, higher inflation and rising interest rates.
Conversely, higher unemployment implies a slowing economy, lower
inflation and eased interest rates.
   If the Labor Department's report shows an unexpected drop in
joblessness, the dollar could rally sharply, some money-market
economists suggested. But others said the fear of inflation could
hurt the dollar as well.
   Moreover, many traders were reluctant to hold speculative
positions in the dollar during the three-day Labor Day weekend. The
net result was to persuade them to avoid the dollar at least until
next Tuesday.
   ``One of the concerns in the market is staying on the
sidelines,'' said Stuart Yannalfo, senior foreign exchange trader
at Refco Inc., a New York-based commodities and currency trading
concern. ``People who are used to trading a lot are waiting for
Friday's number and waiting for the holiday.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar jumped 1.73 yen to close at 136.70. Later
in London, it was quoted at 136.60 yen. By the time trading ended
in New York, the dollar was worth 136.27 yen, slightly cheaper than
its 136.51-yen level late Wednesday.
   The British pound fell, partly because of concerns over
Britain's economy. In London sterling traded at $1.6730, compared
with $1.6830 Wednesday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.6692 vs.
$1.6860 Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with its levels
late Wednesday, included: 1.8730 West German marks, down from
1.8765; 1.5787 Swiss francs, down from 1.5848; 1.2363 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2391; 6.3670 French francs, down from 6.3740;
and 1,393.75 Italian lire, down from 1,394.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday
included: 1.8795 marks, up from 1.8780; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5828; 6.3780 French francs, up from 6.3755; 2.1205 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1230; 1,398.50 Italian lire, up from
1,395.75; 1.2370 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2395.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell $1.10 a troy ounce to $430.20.
   Earlier in London gold closed at $430.70 a troy ounce, up from
$429.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $430.50, up from
$429.50 late Wednesday, and in in Hong Kong it rose $2.65 an ounce
to $432.61.
   Silver for current delivery rose 1.8 cents a troy ounce to
$6.574 on the New York Comex. In London, silver closed at $6.58 an
ounce, up 6 cents.

   Critics of the Suzuki Samurai have failed to
demonstrate the sport-utility vehicle has an excessive tendency to
roll over, federal regulators said Thursday in denying a recall
petition.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did, however,
begin proceedings to establish standards to protect drivers of all
light-duty vehicles ``against unreasonable risk of rollover.''
   Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine,
called for a ban on the Samurai in June, saying the vehicle
``literally trips over its own feet.''
   More than 150,000 of the vehicles have been sold in th United
States.
   NHTSA rejected a petition by the Center for Auto Safety, a
public-interest group often at odds with the auto industry and its
regulators, asking for a safety recall of the Samurai.
   ``The rollover crash involvement of the Samurai appears to be
within the range of most other light utility vehicles,'' the agency
said. ``Rollovers where they have occurred often appear to have
been influenced by adverse driver and environmental factors, such
as high-risk driving maneuvers, drinking, low ambient light and
lack of driver familiarity (with) either the vehicle or the road.''
   The Samurai's rollover rate, based on a study of 1986- and
1987-model vehicles, was six per 100,000 vehicles, NHTSA said. The
Ford Bronco II, by comparison, had a rollover rate of about 19 per
100,000 vehicles. The General Motors S-10 Blazer and S-15 Jimmy had
a rollover rate identical to the Samurai's.
   American Suzuki Motor Corp., the Japanese automaker's U.S.
subsidiary, said it ``claimed victory in its defense of the
4-wheel-drive Suzuki Samurai.''
   NHTSA's decision ``supports claims the Samurai is safe and
should put to rest the inaccurate and misleading attacks on the
vehicle,'' Suzuki said in Brea, Calif. It said it was pleased
``that the unfounded and inaccurate accusations about the Samurai
made by so-called consumer groups did not color NHTSA's judgement
on this matter.''
   The Center for Auto Safety said it would file a petition asking
NHTSA to reconsider its decision.
   ``Despite 113 rollovers, 120 injuries and 25 deaths, NHTSA
refuses to order a recall because it finds other utility vehicles
... are also hazardous,'' the center said. ``If this were the law,
then the Justice Department would refuse to prosecute one mass
murderer because there are other mass murderers.''
   A telephone recording said Consumer Union's offices in Mount
Vernon, N.Y., were closed.
   The highway safety agency granted a petition by the Consumers
Union to start research aimed at drafting regulations to guard
against rollovers.
   The petition ``does not purport to isolate a single cause of
rollover,'' NHTSA said. ``In fact, it acknowledges that there are
`factors other than a vehicle's stability factor (which) play a
role in rollover causation.'''
   The agency listed 10 research projects into vehicle stability it
had completed or planned to complete.
   NHTSA cautioned that granting the Consumers Union's petition
``does not necessarily mean that a rule will be issued.''

<HEAD>Zenith Reveals Planned Standard For Advanced Television</HEAD>

   Zenith Electronics Corp., the last U.S.-owned
television manufacturer, on Thursday proposed a standard for
futuristic television it said would deliver the full promise of the
technology.
   Zenith engineers submitted their proposal to the Federal
Communications Commission's advisory committee on advanced
television services. The action came Thursday as the FCC took
several steps to allow work on high-definition television to
proceed.
   Zenith said its proposal meets all the criteria laid out by the
FCC. In particular, it will not spoil the signal received by people
who stick with their current models of televisions.
   Zenith, based in Glenview, Ill., has stayed in TV manufacturing
even after the market has been largely taken over by Japanese,
South Korean and European companies. The company is reportedly
mulling the sale of the business to a foreign company or a group
representing unionized employees.
   About 20 proposed standards have been submitted to the FCC, but
Zenith said its proposal is the best because it is less susceptible
to problems.
   The audio signals and low-frequency portion of the video signals
would be sent in digital form, cutting down on the amount of power
required to transmit them and thus reducing the problems of
interference.
   The format would make it possible to use channels that are now
kept empty to avoid interference from neighboring channels. It
would make available about twice as many VHF channels and six times
as many UHF channels, making it possible to offer the
magazine-quality pictures and compact disk-quality sound of the new
generation of television, Zenith said.

<HEAD>Dollar Dips, Share Prices Rebound In Early Tokyo Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Stock prices recovered slightly and the U.S. dollar
edged lower against the Japanese yen in Friday morning trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which plunged
431.69 points Thursday, the third largest single-day decline this
year, was up by 30.74 points at 26,965.00 in the first 15 minutes
of trading.
   Dealers said share prices started to recover as the foreign
exchange market stabilized.
   The dollar, which rose 1.73 yen on Thursday, opened at 136.25
yen, down from the previous day's close of 136.70 yen.
   The dollar's decline on Friday morning was due partly to a
0.20-yen loss overnight in the United States, according to a
foreign exchange dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The dollar-buying drive in the market is still strong, but the
rate is not moving that quickly,'' he said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Until the scheduled report of U.S. unemployment figures later
today, there is a wait-and-see mood among investors, which slows
down dollar-buying,'' he added.
