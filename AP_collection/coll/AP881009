<HEAD>Bank Failures To Reach Record Levels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. commercial bank failures are expected to
surpass last year's record level by the end of 1988, with Southwest
institutions continuing to require the most federal assistance, the
head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Sunday.
   But FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the agency remained in
good shape and is expected to have reserves of $15 billion to $16
billion at the end of the year despite the mammoth bailout of First
RepublicBank Corp. and a recent call for help by MCorp, both in
Dallas.
   Meanwhile, Seidman and Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke
reiterated their opposition to a possible merger of the FDIC, which
insures deposits of about 14,000 banks and savings institutions,
and the troubled Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
insures 3,200 savings and loans. Both organizations cover deposits
of up to $100,000.
   Seidman told a news conference at the American Bankers
Association's annual convention that by the end of 1988 as many as
250 banks will have failed or needed federal assistance to stay
afloat.
   Last year a record 184 FDIC-insured institutions failed and 19
received federal assistance. Reserves at the end of 1987 totaled
$18.3 billion.
   ``Right now the '89 outlook looks better to us. It (the failure
rate) could go down as much as 25 percent,'' Seidman said. ``But I
must caution you I made that same prediction a year ago.''
   Seidman said the problem-bank list is slowly declining.
   The farm and energy belts in the Southwest, particularly Texas,
were the biggest trouble spots, said FDIC spokesman Alan J. Whitney.
   Among the biggest bailouts was First RepublicBank Corp., the
largest bank in Texas. It had $28.6 billion in assets when the FDIC
seized all 40 of its subsidiary banks earlier this year before
agreeing to sell them to NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.
   And last week, MCorp, the second-largest bank in Texas with
assets of about $20.1 billion, said that it probably would need
federal assistance to survive. The bank said it expected to post
the biggest loss in its history, about $525 million, in the third
quarter that ended Sept. 30.
   Seidman said it was too soon to tell how much federal
assistance, if any, might be needed for MCorp. ``We just received
their application on Saturday,'' he said. ``It's premature to have
any opinion.''
   Still, Seidman said that ``a number of substantial institutions
... are interested'' in a possible investment in MCorp.
   In discussing the ailing savings and loan industry, both Seidman
and Clarke said they remained opposed to a merger of the FDIC and
FSLIC. However, both agreed it was likely to be considered by
Congress and the new president.
   The FDIC hopes to complete a study that began about eight months
ago on possible solutions for the thrift crisis, Seidman said. The
cost of liquidating or rescuing the nearly 800 problem thrifts
nationwide has ranged from $45 billion to $100 billion, and many
experts are predicting that taxpayers eventually will have to foot
the bill.
   But Clarke insisted ``all other alternatives should be
considered before the taxpayers are asked to pick up the tab.''

<HEAD>UAW Ratifies Deere Contract With Pay Raise, Job Security</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 3rd graf to CORRECT to Karl sted Kark.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blue-collar workers at Deere & Co. plants in
five states overwhelmingly ratified a new contract with their first
general pay raise since 1981, United Auto Workers officials said
Sunday.
   The three-year pact won 90 percent approval in a vote Saturday
and Sunday at Deere facilities in Illinois, Iowa, Atlanta,
Minneapolis and Denver, the union's secretary-treasurer, Bill
Casstevens, said.
   The union does not reveal the actual vote on contract
ratifications, spokesman Karl Mantyla said.
   The agreement, approved by negotiators representing 13,500
factory workers, takes effect immediately.
   ``Obviously, we're very pleased to have a new three-year labor
agreement with the UAW,'' said Robert Combs, a spokesman for Deere.
   ``It addresses key areas of importance to both of us,'' he said,
citing operational efficiency, training, job security and
compensation.
   ``It's an agreement we can live with and work with,'' he said.
   The contract give Deere workers an average pay raise of 44.3
cents an hour in the first year, followed by lump-sum payments
equal to 3 percent of their base salary in each of the second and
third years of the pact.
   Union workers at Deere, the nation's leading manufacturer of
farm machinery, have earned an average $15.47 per hour.
   Deere's union workforce had not received a general pay raise
since 1981. The company has given only cost-of-living increases
using a formula tied to the consumer price index.
   The contract calls for a three-step increase in early retirement
benefits.
   The union also won important safeguards protecting workers from
layoffs. The contract guarantees jobs for all workers employed at
the time the pact was ratified.
   Deere is only able to lay off the remainder of its current
employees in times of high inventories, labor disputes, plant
closings, sale of a division of the company or an act of God.
   Company and union representatives negotiated daily for nearly
two months before a climactic 20-hour session that ended with
approval of the contract proposal.
   Deere and union officials had negotiated furiously to avoid a
repeat of the bitter five-month strike in 1986-87 that ended after
163 days with employees accepting a wage freeze and other
concessions.
   The union plans to soon resume contract negotiations with
Caterpillar Inc. The UAW has been meeting with negotiators for
Peoria-based Caterpillar for two months at a site in Bridgeton,
Mo., near St. Louis.
   Caterpillar, the world's leading manufacturer of earth-moving
equipment, and the union agreed to extend its contract, originally
set to expire Sept. 30, until the Deere talks were completed. The
Caterpillar contract affects 17,500 factory workers in five states.

   Here are some facts and figures on Algeria:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND: Algeria, on the southern shore of the Mediterranean,
is the second largest African country after the Sudan. Its 919,595
square miles _ 3 times the size of Texas _ are mostly uninhabited
desert.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE: Most of the estimated 25 million people are Arab and
Moslem, with a significant Berber minority. Most live in a narrow,
700-mile-long fertile coastal strip. With one of the highest birth
rates in the world, the annual population growth is 3.5 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY: Algeria once earned more than $12 billion a year
from oil and gas. Oil prices plummeted in the 1980s while the
population explosion continued, causing severe shortages of
consumer goods. More than 1 million Algerians live and work in
Western Europe and send home about $400 million a year. The
Algerian dinar is worth about 20 cents.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY: Once part of the Ottoman Empire, Algeria remained
loosely controlled by Turkey until the French seized control in
1830 on the grounds that Algerian pirates were interfering with
international shipping in the Mediterranean.
   Algeria became an integral part of France, and 1.5 million
French farmers settled in the fertile areas. Moslems were denied
equal rights with French citizens, breeding resentment that led to
the revolution.
   On Nov. 1, 1954, the underground National Liberation Front
attacked French military and civilian installations. Independence
came in 1962 after two years of talks with the government of
President Charles de Gaulle.
   Most of the French settlers fled when their land was
nationalized in 1963. Col. Houari Boumedienne, the commander of the
nationalist forces, seized power in 1965 and introduced a
Soviet-style regime harshly critical of the United States and
Israel. He became one of the leaders of the non-aligned movement.
   Boumedienne died in office in 1978 and was replaced by
then-Chief of Staff Col. Chadli Bendjedid, who has softened the
regime despite opposition from hardliners.

<HEAD>Survey Says Gas Prices Drop Nearly One Penny Over Past Two Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices nationwide dropped an average
of nearly one cent per gallon during the past two weeks, and more
price drops can be expected, an industry analyst said Sunday.
   Results of the latest twice-monthly survey of 12,000 gas
stations for the period from Sept. 23 to Oct. 7 shows an average
price for all grades, including taxes, of $1.0077 cents a gallon,
Trilby Lundberg, editor of the Lundberg Survey, said.
   The average was down about one penny from the previous survey,
Ms. Lundberg said.
   She said wholesale prices generally fell more than retail during
the same period, reductions that gas station owners may pass along
to consumers.
   At self-service stations, which have the majority of retail
sales, average prices were 91.31 cents for regular unleaded gas;
$1.06 for premium unleaded and 87.63 cents for regular leaded.
   Full service prices included: regular unleaded at $1.20; premium
unleaded $1.31; and regular leaded at $1.17, according to the
survey.

<HEAD>Talks End On Negotiations For Cuban Withdrawal From Angola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Informal bilateral talks ended Sunday on
plans for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola without
reaching agreement on a timetable for their departure, sources said
Sunday.
   The New York Times in Monday's editions, however, reported
officials from Angola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States
agreed Sunday that all Cuban troops should be withdrawn from Angola
within 24 to 30 months.
   The Times' account quoted unidentified American officials as
saying the agreement had been reached after three days'
negotiations in New York.
   The negotiators had not expected a breakthough at these
meetings, which were hastily arranged because senior diplomats from
all the nations involved were in New York attending the 43rd U.N.
General Assembly.
   South Africa has linked its willingness to cooperate with a
one-year independence plan for neighboring South-West Africa, which
it rules, to the withdrawal of the Cuban troops _ soldiers that
Pretoria says threaten the territory's independence.
   Diplomats involved in the talks say they are working toward
reaching agreement on a withdrawal timetable at a formal meeting to
be held later this month in the Congo.
   That meeting will be crucial because the negotiators are running
out of time to achieve a compromise before Nov. 1, the date South
Africa has suggested for implementation of the U.N.'s independence
plan for South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Negotiators for Cuba, Angola, South Africa and the United
States, which has acted as mediator, held a series of bilateral
discussions throughout the week, with a four-party meeting taking
place Friday in a midtown Manhattan hotel.
   Chester Crocker, U.S. Undersecretary of State for African
Affairs, mediated the talks, a role he played earlier this year in
Brazzaville, Congo, the U.S. and South African officials said.
   South Africa's delegation was led by Neil van Heerden, that
country's director-general of political affairs, said Aubry Dwyer,
a spokesman for South Africa's U.N. Mission.
   In earlier talks, Cuba and Angola first said the withdrawal
would take four years, then compromised to three.
   Last month South Africa and Angola agreed on a two-year
withdrawal in phases, with early retreat from Angola's southern
border with South-West Africa, but Cuba said the withdrawal would
take 28 months.
   If the Brazzaville talks are successful, the United Nations
plans to send a peacekeeping force of 7,500 backed by 2,000
civilian support staff to oversee elections for a national assembly
in South-West Africa to approve a constitution and independent
government.
   South African security forces would gradually withdraw under the
supervision of the U.N. peacekeepers, as specified in Security
Council Resolution 435, passed a decade ago.
   South Africa has ruled South-West Africa since World War I. The
U.N.'s predecessor, the League of Nations, gave Pretoria a mandate
to govern the former German colony.
   The General Assembly, Security Council and International Court
of Justice have since revoked the mandate and declared South
Africa's administration illegal.
   The Cuban troops are in Angola to defend that country's Marxist
government from the U.S.- and South African-backed UNITA rebel
movement. Many observers doubt the ability of the Angolan army to
resist UNITA's attacks without the Cuban troops, if Washington and
Pretoria continue their support.
   The UNITA rebels have not been party to these talks, nor have
the Marxist rebels of SWAPO, the South-West Africa People's
Organization, which has been fighting for independence for Namibia
for more than 20 years.
   According to the Times account, the accord reached Sunday
insures that some Cuban troops will remain in Angola after South
Africa grants independence to Namibia.
   The Times quoted an American official as saying the Nov. 1
transition of Namibia to independence remained a ``political
commitment'' of the negotiators.
   A South African official was quoted by the Times as saying that
Nov. 1, while ``still the target,'' was perhaps not achievable.

   A group of youths crashed a college
fraternity party Sunday, shot out windows and got into a fight that
left one student injured, Suffolk County police said.
   The police arrested seven Long Island youths and charged two of
them with the assault.
   All seven were charged with burglary and weapons possession
following the incident on the campus of the State University of New
York at Stonybrook, said Officer Linda Cicalese, a police
spokeswoman.
   The police were called to the school at 2:45 a.m. after
residents of a college dormitory reported hearing shots near a Phi
Beta Sigma fraternity fund-raiser, Cicalese said.
   The seven youths tried to gain entrance to the party and got
into a fight with Pedro Mojica, 20, of Brentwood. Mojica was cut on
the face with a knife or razor blade and was treated at Stonybrook
University Hospital, Cicalese said.
   Shots were fired through windows during the incident, but nobody
was wounded, said Officer Salvatore Yovino, another spokesman.
   Mojica knew the attackers, Cicalese said. She said she did not
know the cause of the fight, but said it was not racially motivated.
   Police stopped a car in Central Islip at 3:50 a.m. that matched
the description of a car fleeing the party, and recovered
.22-caliber semi-automatic rifle and a .32-caliber automatic
pistol, Yovino said, along with some stolen stereo equipment.

   After gulping 13 Moon Pies in 10 minutes to
win the World Championship Moon Pie Eating Contest, David Dunn was
ready to celebrate.
   With a Moon Pie.
   Dunn, 23, of the town of Arab, upset last year's winner, Rodney
Frazer, the ``Rambo of Moon Pies,'' in Saturday's contest. Frazer
ate 11 of the marshmallow pies to tie John Reynolds for second
place among 32 contestants.
   Last year, the 30-year-old Frazer ate 15 pies, a lawyer of
marshallow between two graham-cracker-like cookies.
   ``I had some pretty stiff competition,'' said Frazer, who wore a
tuxedo and a Moon Pie T-shirt and arrived in a limousine.
   But Dunn had practiced. ``I've gained about 10 pounds in a
week,'' he said. That's not too surprising. Dunn ate nine last week
to win a similar contest in his hometown.
   Sponsored by Wal-Mart, the contest started in 1985 when
assistant manager John Love and two other employees unknowingly
ordered Moon Pies from the Chattanooga Bakery at the same time.
   Love found himself with 21,000 Moon Pies, which provided the
inspiration for the contest.
   Dunn said he planned a celebration dinner of a cola and at least
one more Moon Pie.

   For computer junkies, it was a test of random
access memory _ in their brains, not their terminals.
   Two five-member teams representing California's Silicon Valley
and Boston's Route 128 vied to answer questions Friday night in the
first annual Computer Bowl.
   Sitting under an electronic scoreboard that flashed stock prices
during pauses in the game, the contestants slapped their buzzers
furiously and waged a see-saw battle, but the East team ultimately
won, defeating the West, 375-310.
   Industry executives paid up to $500 each for tickets to the
whimsical event, a fund-raiser expected to produce $150,000 for
Boston's non-profit Computer Museum.
   The game, taped by the Public Broadcasting System for its
``Computer Chronicle'' television series, followed the rules of the
old ``College Bowl'' television quiz show. But the questions
clearly were aimed at people who think homecoming weekend is a
nostalgic visit to their favorite mainframe.
   Among the questions: ``Which high-tech company determined
whether the 18-minute gap in the Richard Nixon tapes was
deliberate?'' and ``In which Disney movie do the main characters
live inside a computer?''
   Answers: Bolt, Beranek and Newman and ``Tron.''
   There was also some fun in the competition, including a ``high
tech tailgate party'' and a cheerleading squad to boost that old
industry spirit.
   A sample cheer: ``Shift to the left. Shift to the right. Push
down. Pop up. Byte. Byte. Byte.''

   Followers of Harry Houdini will be looking
for his ghost on Halloween.
   A secret location will be the spot for the annual Official
Houdini Seance, as organizers hope to rouse the spirit of the
magician who died more than 60 years ago.
   Houdini was born Ehrich Weiss, the son of Mayer Samuel Weiss,
Appleton's first rabbi. He devoted a substantial part of his career
to debunking people who claimed they could communicate with the
dead through certain mediums. He vowed to find a channel for such
communication _ if it existed _ after his own death.
   Houdini died Oct. 31, 1926, in Detroit, from peritonitis caused
by an unexpected blow to the abdomen by a young man who wanted to
test Houdini's strength.
   The seance has been held on Halloween every year since Houdini's
death, and it has never made contact with the spirit of the escape
artist.
   Organizers of this year's seance are Thomas J. Boldt of Appleton
and Sydney H. Radner of Holyoke, Mass.
   Radner will bring along a set of handcuffs Houdini said he would
unlock if ever he returned from the dead. Henry Muller, owner of
the Houdini Hall of Fame in Niagara Falls, Ontario, will be present
with an envelope said to contain a code Houdini devised to prove or
disprove that his spirit was among the seekers.
   Once the medium is in a trance, amid the dim lighting and
silence, those at the seance will direct questions to the medium
and to Houdini's spirit.

<HEAD>Official Says Workers Not Endangered by Chemicals Believed Used on
Stealth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. workers believed to be
assembling top-secret Stealth fighter planes have not been put at
risk by hazardous chemicals used in their work, a company official
said.
   ``I cannot emphasize too strongly that we have seen nothing to
indicate the materials we work with are fundamentally unsafe or
pose a health hazard, providing proper procedures are followed,''
John C. Brizendine, president of Lockheed's Aeronautical Systems
Co., said in an editorial in the company's employee newsletter
published Thursday.
   Seventy-five employees at the company's Burbank plant have filed
suit against Lockheed and firms making and supplying various
chemicals believed to used in making the fighter.
   About 150 employees have filed worker's compensation claims
charging they suffer from illnesses caused by dangerous chemicals.
   Lockheed workers claim composite materials used in the Stealth
fighter, designed not to reflect radar, and chemicals used to mill
or clean them are causing rashes, nausea, dizziness, memory loss
and lack of concentration, according to Rep. Howard Berman,
D-Calif., whose district includes Burbank.
   Inspectors from the federal Occupational Health and Safety
Administration and the Pentagon announced last week they were
inspecting Lockheed's facilities, but they have declined to comment
on what they have found.
   The employees have said security provisions forbidding them from
discussing their work with outsiders have hampered them from
seeking treatment from private physicians.
   However, Brizendine said employees could seek help from private
doctors and show doctors company lists of chemicals they use.

<HEAD>Police Say No Charges Expected In 1968 Death of Melvyn Paisley's
Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No charges will be filed in the 1968 death of the
second wife of former Boeing Co. executive and Pentagon probe
figure Melvyn Paisley, according to a report published Sunday.
   Paisley, the center of a Justice Department and FBI
investigation into bribery and bid rigging at the Pentagon, has
been married twice since Mary Lou Paisley's death.
   ``We have found nothing that would permit us to pursue criminal
charges against anybody,'' said Sgt. Harlan Bollinger, the homicide
detective who investigated the death of the Kent housewife for
three months.
   The investigation included an inquiry court session similar to a
grand jury proceeding. Police said they interviewed more than 50
people and examined all available evidence.
   The current King County medical examiner, Dr. Donald Reay, said
in June that the autopsy performed on Mrs. Paisley was inconclusive.
   Police said they can't say for certain how Mrs. Paisley died.
   The county prosecutor's office this week is expected to decline
to file formal charges from Mrs. Paisley's death, The Seattle Times
reported in its Sunday editions. She was 30 when she was found dead
in her young son's bathroom in the couple's home in the early hours
of May 8, 1968.
   At the time, Paisley told authorities that his wife, who was an
artist, apparently had gotten up during the night to paint and was
overcome by fumes while cleaning her brushes. He said she had gone
to bed earlier after having taken a drink and two sleeping pills.
   The autopsy found no trace of sleeping pills, alcohol or paint
solvent in Mrs. Paisley's blood.
   Paisley, a Boeing manager at the time of his second wife's
death, is a Washington, D.C., defense consultant.
   Paisley, who now lives in Virginia, said he had no comment.
   Nine months after Mrs. Paisley's death in 1968, Paisley married
his Boeing secretary. He divorced her in 1980 and married his
fourth wife, a 30-year-old Boeing computer analyst, Vicki McKim.
The fourth Mrs. Paisley has been implicated along with Paisley in
the current Pentagon probe.
   Reba Klimas criticized county police this summer for failing to
investigate the death of her sister, Mary Lou Paisley, 20 years
ago. Informed of the latest development in the case, she said, ``I
feel better about myself. I feel that we have at least tried to
find out what really happened to Mary Lou.''

   A bomb hidden in a bag of fruit and

three of them critically, authorities said Sunday.
   Police said the explosion occurred late Saturday night as the
bus was about to leave for the Punjabi city of Sialkot from
Rawalpindi's general bus stand.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
but Pakistan has blamed scores of terrorist bombings over the past
two years on agents of Afghanistan's communist government.
   Pakistan arms and supports Moslem rebels who are fighting the
Kabul government and Soviet troops backing it up.
   Eyewitnesses said the saboteur hid the bomb in a bag of fruit
and bread which he placed at the front of the bus and then stepped
out, saying he was going for tea, according to police. The bomb
weighed about 6{ pounds, they said.
   The official news agency APP said three of the injured were in
critical condition. Police did not know how many people were aboard
the bus at the time of the explosion.

   About 200 people have died and hundreds

   Most of the deaths came in clashes between the army and
demonstrators in the southern and eastern suburbs of Algiers, in
the western port city of Oran and in a dozen other provincial
centers, the sources said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rioters have been protesting the government's austerity policies
and escalating prices.
   Interior Minister El Hadi Khediri said in a televised address
Saturday night that members of the security forces were among the
dead, but he gave no figures.
   Bachir Rouiz, the information minister, told a news conference
Saturday that too many authorities were involved to give an
accurate official list of casualties.
   The police and hospital sources gave casualty accounts amounting
to at least 200 killed, with many hundred wounded.
   The largest number of casualties appeared to come from Kouba on
the southern fringes of Algiers, where witnesses said the army shot
directly into the crowd Saturday night after people ignored
repeated calls to disperse.
   The army used heavy machine guns mounted on tanks and jeeps in
Kouba, according to witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Hospital sources there later reported more than 60 dead.
   The government announced Friday night and later repeated that
soldiers had orders to fire on protesters defying a ban on
demonstrations under a state of emergency proclaimed Thursday.

   A multimillion-dollar battle is being waged in
Massachusetts over a binding referendum that could produce the
nation's first voter-mandated shutdown of nuclear power plants.
   Voters here will decide on Nov. 8 whether to ban ``the continued
generation of electric power by commercial nuclear power plants in
the commonwealth by means which result in the production of nuclear
waste'' after July 4, 1989.
   Boston Edison Co., Yankee Atomic and other utilities have
funneled more than $5 million into an organization called Citizens
Against the Shutdown Initiative, outspending anti-nuclear activists
by nearly 20-1.
   Anti-nuclear activists collected 120,000 signatures to qualify
the referendum for the November ballot. Similar measures have
failed in Oregon, Maine and California.
   A poll by The Boston Globe in late September of 619 registered
voters said 49 percent opposed the referendum, 37 favored it and 14
percent were undecided.
   The measure, if adopted, would force the shutdown of Boston
Edison Co.'s troubled Pilgrim nuclear station in Plymouth _ a
16-year-old plant closed for the past 2{ years for nearly $400
million in safety, management and technical improvements after the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission rated it one of the nation's
worst-run nuclear plants.
   Boston Edison, confident it has corrected problems at Pilgrim,
has applied for NRC permission to restart the plant. Massachusetts
officials are still concerned about the adequacy of evacuation
plans.
   The state's other nuclear plant _ Yankee Atomic Electric Co.'s
station in Rowe in western Massachusetts _ also could be closed by
the referendum. Though relatively small and with a good operating
record, it is the oldest operating nuclear station in the country
at 28 years.
   ``We have two plants that have specific problems that really ...
increase the danger and the threat from radioactivity and potential
accidents,'' said Anna Gyorgy of the Citizens for Safe Energy
campaign promoting the referendum.
   Citizens Against the Shutdown acknowledges industry backing, but
claims both pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear members. The group says
the value of Pilgrim and Rowe should be studied individually with a
view to what alternative sources of power are available to replace
them.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis takes the same position and has opposed the
referendum for that reason.
   Opponents contend that if the referendum passes, the state will
be forced to compensate the utilities potentially up to $4 billion.
Supporters argue utility shareholders and ratepayers will pay.

   Her ponytails have been close-cropped and
her figure isn't what it used to be, but Olga Korbut still has the
spunk and sparkle that won hearts and gold medals during the 1972
Olympics.
   The former Olympic gymnast toured sports facilities in
Indianapolis on Friday and visited officials of the United States
Gymnastics Federation.
   Korbut, 33, had been rushed through meetings and museums, but
still was filled with impish energy when she arrived at the Pan
American Plaza.
   ``My life is very interesting. It's almost as though someone is
watching over me and writing what my life will be,'' she said
through an interpreter.
   Korbut, who on Wednesday will be honored at the gymnastics
convention in California, retired from competition in 1978. She
continues to travel around the Soviet Union and recruit students
for the Byelorussia gymnastics school in Minsk.
   Two of her students made the Olympics in Seoul and Korbut
received a photograph of one of them from the U.S. Gymnastics
Federation.
   ``I will show this to her and say, `See, this is why you didn't
win,''' she said with a laugh.

   Actor Danny Glover says a student strike at
San Francisco State University 20 years ago helped make it possible
for him to star in such successful movies as ``The Color Purple.''
   ``My work as an actor has been affected by the strike here at
State,'' Glover told 600 people attending a rally Friday
commemorating the strike, which began Nov. 6, 1968.
   Glover, one of the leaders during the controversial six-month
strike, said the groups involved fought for racial equality and
ethnic studies, bringing the issues to the attention of a
previously indifferent nationwide public.
   The strike began after negotiations broke down between
administrators and the Black Students Union. It resulted in the
establishment of a School of Ethnic Studies in the spring of 1969.
   Admnistrators closed the school twice and more than 2,000
students were arrested and several faculty members were dismissed
after they joined strikers.
   Former Sen. S.I. Hayakawa, then president of the college, became
a national figure by taking a hard line against strikers.

<HEAD>Experts Reconstruct King Midas' Head in Plaster and Clay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British experts have used a 2,684-year-old skull
to reconstruct the head of King Midas, who according to legend
turned everything he touched turned into gold, the Sunday Times
reported.
   Dr. John Prag, an archaeologist at the Manchester Museum, and
Richard Neave, an illustrator in the department of medicine at
Manchester University, used the latest knowledge about distribution
of skin tissue on bone to produce the plaster and clay head, the
newspaper said.
   Midas ruled Phrygia in what is now central Turkey from 738 B.C.
until 696 B.C. and was considered the most important member of the
Phrygian dynasty.
   According to mythology, Dionysius, the god of wine, granted
Midas the golden touch and the king's food and even his daughter
turned to gold. He overcame the curse by bathing in a river. The
legend was apparently inspired by Midas' great wealth.
   In 1957, American archaeologists found what was believed to be
Midas' tomb in Turkey. The skeleton was lost, the Sunday Times
said, but last month Turkey invited Prag and Neave to make a
plaster cast of the skull and attempt the kind of reconstruction
they made in 1983 of the head of King Philip II of Macedonia,
father of Alexander the Great.
   The two experts drilled tiny holes in the plaster cast, inserted
matchsticks at strategic points and smoothed on clay to the
appropriate thicknesses, the newspaper said.
   Photos accompanying the Times' story showed a long, narrow face
with a sharply hooked nose, small deep-set eyes, a downturned mouth
and prominent lower lip.
   Neave was quoted as saying that the striking feature of Midas'
head was that it was deliberately elongated by bandaging in
childhood because long, distorted heads were considered attractive
at the time.
   Dr. Ellen Kohler, one of the American archaeologists who
discoverered the tomb in 1957, was thrilled when shown a photo of
the reconstruction, the newspaper said.
   ``The face is quite striking,'' she was quoted as saying in
Philadelphia. ``It fits in with the one terracotta figure of him
that exists.''
   She was quoted as saying the now missing skeleton was of a man 5
feet 3 inches tall who had died at the age 65.
   Legend also has it that Apollo, god of music, gave Midas an ass'
ears after Midas judged a music contest between Apollo and Pan, the
god of fields and forests, and found in favor of Pan.
   The Sunday Times quoted Prag as saying that if Midas suffered
from a malformation of the ear cartilage, called Darwin's tubercle,
it might explain the legend.
   ``We are pursuing it from a medical point of view and our
colleagues in Turkey are going to get in touch with anthropologists
and geneticists to see if the condition is still prevalent in
central Turkey,'' the newspaper quoted Prag as saying.
   The Times said Midas is believed to have been killed or have
committed suicide when his kingdom was devastated by a barbarian
tribe called the Cimmerians, and some argue he would therefore not
have been given the rich sort of burial indicated by findings at
the tomb.
   Professor Rodney Young, who led the American expedition, thought
the tomb was of Midas' predecessor King Gordios, the newspaper
said. But today most experts, including other members of the team,
believe it was that of Midas, it said.

<TEXT>
   A Prussian count and former
economics minister convicted last year of tax evasion was elected
head of The Free Democrats, junior partners in West Germany's
coalition government.
   Otto Graf Lambsdorff, who resigned as economics minister four
years ago during a scandal over alleged illegal political
contributions by the West German Flick industrial group, won the
job of party chairman Saturday.
   He defeated challenger Irmgard Adam-Schwaetzer for the job at
the Free Democrats' national party congress.
   In February 1987, a court convicted Lambsdorff of tax evasion
and fined him $96,000 but acquitted him on the more serious charge
of corruption in connection with the scandal.
   Lambsdorff denied any wrongdoing during his 18-month trial,
alleging the charges against him were politically motivated.
   The 61-year-old Lambsdorff takes over as the Free Democrats' new
chairman from Martin Bangemann, who is West Germany's current
economics minister.
   Bangemann is resigning as economics minister to take a seat next
year on the European Economic Community Commission in Brussels.
   Ms. Adam-Schwaetzer, 46, a high-ranking official in the West
German Foreign Ministry and a protege of Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, received 187 votes to Lambsdorff's 211 in
Saturday's voting.
   The business-oriented Free Democrats are partners in West
Germany's coalition government, which also includes Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and the conservative Christian
Social Union.

<BYLINE>Does Bush, Born and Bred A Yankee, Qualify As A True Texan?
^By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEEVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every year, Vice President George Bush
totes a shotgun through the South Texas mesquite and huisache brush
to hunt quail and other birds, like many Texans.
   But does Bush, born and bred a Yankee, qualify as a true Texan?
   ``Texas is really his home and he loves the state. He comes down
as much as he possibly can,'' said Will Farish, whose Houston
company handles Bush's assets in a blind trust. Farish also owns
the 10,000-acre ranch where Bush has hunted for 20 years.
   Says Daniel Ouellette of Beeville, president of the Texas
Republican County Chairman's Association: ``He's lived in Texas
longer than I've been born.'' Quellette is 40.
   ``George Bush has been portrayed by some in the media as
Harvard, Northeasterner, wealthy, wealthy, wealthy,'' Ouellette
said. ``They don't do the same with Lloyd Bentsen. They look at him
differently.''
   Like Bush, the Democratic vice presidential candidate and native
of the Rio Grande Valley, often reminds Texas audiences that he's
``back home.''
   With Bush and Bentsen on opposing tickets and 29 electoral votes
in the balance, Texas has become a crucial battleground in the
presidential race.
   So how does each candidate claim the title of native son?
   Bush votes in Houston, reared his children in Texas, made a
respectable sum in the oil business and was elected to Congress
from Texas.
   He was born in Milton, Mass., in 1924, grew up in Greenwich,
Conn., and first came to Texas during World War II to train as a
Navy pilot at the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.
   In 1948 he returned to the Lone Star State to take a job in
Odessa, in the middle of the West Texas oil patch. He was
transferred to California about a year later to sell drilling bits,
then returned in 1950 to Midland, near Odessa.
   He eventually formed Zapata Petroleum with partners that
included J. Hugh Liedtke, who later became head of the Pennzoil Co.
   ``George made a comfortable amount of money out of it,'' Liedtke
told The Associated Press in an interview earlier this year. ``It
was a substantial sum, but he's not what in Texas is called `Big
Rich'.''
   The Bushes and their five children later moved to Houston. Bush
became Harris County Republican chairman in 1962, ran
unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1964, won a House seat in
1966 and sold his 6 percent stake in Zapata for $1.1 million.
   Bush has not owned a home in Texas since he became vice
president in 1981.
   His legal voting residence is Suite 271 of the Houstonian Hotel
and Conference Center. His voting eligibility was challenged by a
Houston state representative because Bush purchased a home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, after becoming vice president, and has lived
in the vice president's residence in Washington, D.C.
   But Bush prevailed in the 1985 case, because the Texas
Constitution allows a voter to continue to claim state residency if
he is serving elsewhere in the federal government.
   He lost a 1984 battle with the Internal Revenue Service,
however, when he used the Maine address on his income tax return.
The idea was to avoid capital gains tax on profits from the sale of
his $792,000 Houston home by reinvesting them in the Kennebunkport
house.
   The IRS ruled that Bush's principal residence, the only one for
which the tax break was allowed, was Washington, D.C. _ not Maine _
and that he therefore had to pay.
   Attorney Harold DeMoss, who represented Bush at the June 3,
1985, hearing on his voting eligibility, presented Harris County
Assessor Carl Smith with documents proving that Bush owned
undeveloped land in Houston, had a Texas driver's license and
belonged to a Houston church.
   Bentsen lists the Arrowhead Ranch in Starr County as his voting
residence.
   ``I would guess on average he spends 35 percent of his time in
Texas and for the last two years I would say 50 percent,'' said
Jack DeVore, spokesman for Bentsen's race for re-election to the
U.S. Senate.
   Bentsen's father made a fortune in real estate and agriculture
in the Rio Grande Valley.
   Calvin Bentsen of McAllen, a cousin of the senator, said they
grew up together in South Texas working on their fathers' farms.
   ``He likes the valley,'' Calvin Bentsen said. ``He likes the
ranch life out there.''
   Bentsen's first elected office was as county judge of Hidalgo
County in 1947. He served in Congress from 1949 to 1954 before
dropping out of politics to become president of Lincoln
Consolidated, a financial holding company.
   Bentsen defeated Bush and was elected to the Senate in 1970.
   Some doubt whether voters will place much importance on either
candidate's Texas residency.
   Ouellette said people will judge Bush not by his residence but
by his conservatism.
   Besides, says ranch owner Farish, ``I don't know exactly what a
Texas accent is.''

<TEXT>
   When political filmmaker Charles Guggenheim
was asked to list the qualities that Democrat Michael Dukakis
projects in this presidential campaign, he responded with this:
``controlled, efficient, knowledgeable, predictable, humorless.''
   What about likable?
   ``No, I don't think likable is one of them,'' he said.
   Is that a problem?
   ``Oh, it's a serious problem.''
   Guggenheim, whose career dates back to his service as Democratic
candidate Adlai Stevenson's television consultant in the 1950s,
expresses a widespread view that Dukakis has a serious image
problem which his TV campaign commercials are doing very little to
dispel.
   ``The smartest clerk in the world,'' was how ABC's Peter
Jennings, a panelist for the first presidential debate last month,
described the Massachusetts governor to preface a question about
his passionless, technocratic governing style.
   ``Passionless?'' responded the Democratic nominee with a smile.
``I care deeply about people, all people: working people, working
families, people all over this country.''
   But does that concern come across to people who watch Dukakis
debating or see him campaigning on TV news broadcasts?
   ``Dukakis comes across like your accountant or, God forbid, your
dentist,'' said New York media consultant David Garth. ``You know
you have to see him, but you don't look forward to it.''
   ``He is a very, very conservative guy and he is a very
deliberate guy and he has no natural sense of humor,'' said Garth,
who says Republican nominee George Bush doesn't display much more
appeal than Dukakis.
   ``I don't think there's any warmth or depth of feeling for
either one of these guys,'' Garth said.
   The public catches only rare glimpses of Dukakis in repose. He
takes a ``power walk'' every night, dressed in a casual warmup
suit, but photographers are not welcome. Bush, by contrast, jogs
regularly with reporters and cameras in tow.
   Judy Pearson, a professor of interpersonal communication at Ohio
University who has written extensively on how women react to
presidential candidates, said Dukakis' manner doesn't blend with
his message.
   ``He tends to be very stiff, cold,'' she said. ``He doesn't have
warmth, even though the message tends to be one of caring for
people, for the hungry and homeless.''
   She said his delivery of the words contradicts what he's saying.
   What she called his ``non-verbal message'' is ``cold, short
phrases being thrown out like bullets.''
   ``When people look at a verbal and a non-verbal message and
they're in contradiction, what we tend to do is subconsciously
believe the non-verbal message,'' she said.
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, professor of communications at the
University of Texas and author of ``Packaging the Presidency,''
said Dukakis' gestures don't go over well.
   ``He originally had a pointing, thrusting gesture that looked
like he thought he was superior and giving a lecture, and the
problem with it was it underscored a tone that was subtle but real
in his speech,'' she said.
   ``He sounds as if he knows more than we do. The danger is you
can put a spin on that to suggest he's arrogant and patronizing and
moralistic and self-righteous.''
   ``We don't like people who think they're better than we are,''
she said.
   Is there something Dukakis could do to warm up his image?
   ``I'm not sure from my experience that a person like that is
changeable,'' said Guggenheim.
   ``I think they could make television films which would help
allay some of this problem,'' he said. ``But it would have to be
done by an outside hand. The moments in which he does show some
sensitivity, warmth and compassion are unguarded. ... They wouldn't
be dishonest moments. They just would be moments the candidate
doesn't feel are important.''
   Guggenheim and Garth independently offered almost identical
criticism of the series of Dukakis television ads in which actors
portray political advisers trying to create a positive image for
Bush.
   ``By putting those ads on themselves and being sponsors of them,
they (the Dukakis campaign) are showing they are no different than
the people they are criticizing,'' Guggenheim said.
   ``I think the ads are a disaster,'' Garth said.
   ``The message is, Bush is packaged, and we're delivering that
message in our own package,'' he said.

   The wife of former Lt. Col. Gregorio
Honasan, the leader of the coup attempt that nearly toppled the
government last year, has given birth to a girl, it was reported
Sunday.
   Manila newspapers said Klarissa Honasan was born Friday to Jane
Honasan and weighed 7 pounds, 6 ounces. The baby is the couple's
fifth child.
   Honasan led the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt against President
Corazon Aquino's government in which at least 53 people died and
hundreds were wounded.
   Honasan was arrested in December but escaped in April and
remains at large.
   Mrs. Honasan told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that she has
received many visitors at the hospital in suburban Mandaluyong
since Klarissa's birth. But her husband, one of the country's most
wanted fugitives, has not been among them. ``Oh, but there'll be
time later,'' Mrs. Honasan was quoted as saying.

   Tons of food, medicine and other
supplies are pouring into Jamaica, but officials and relief
agencies say much more is needed to feed and shelter tens of
thousands left homeless by Hurricane Gilbert.
   ``The aid is reaching the people, the problem is the magnitude
of their need,'' said an official close to Prime Minister Edward
Seaga. ``It's like an endless pit, the suffering of the people is
greater than the amount of aid available.''
   Seaga said in a nationally broadcast speech last week that by
Christmas, he hoped ``comfort will be restored to those who are
shelterless, farmers will be in the fields and the lights will
shine again.''
   He told Parliament that Gilbert caused $818 million to $1
billion damage in Jamaica, far less than the $8 billion he
estimated when Gilbert's 130 mph winds slammed into the island
Sept. 12.
   The latest government damage report said the storm killed 45
people, severely damaged or destroyed half the country's homes and
caused $200 million damage to banana, coconut, coffee and other
crops.
   Seaga said other countries and international agencies such as
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have pledged
$515 million in aid, including $125 million from the United States.
   He said the funds would cover government emergency spending and
regular fiscal year expenses, but more is needed to repair damage
to private farms, shops and industries.
   Most of the hundreds of tons of donated food, medicine and
building material from abroad is handled by private relief
organizations, such as the Salvation Army, the Red Cross and
Project Accord, a grouping of local churches.
   The agencies say their most urgent needs are plastic sheeting,
zinc roofing and lumber.
   There are no official figures on the number of people left
homeless by the storm.
   Seaga originally estimated a half million homeless, but Jean
Lewis, director of the Jamaican Information Service, said officials
now believe the number is much less.
   The Salvation Army said it is caring for about 50,000 homeless
nationwide, and the Red Cross has about 26,000 in its shelters.
Both agencies operate dozens of shelters across this nation of 2.3
million people.
   About 200 people still homeless three weeks after the hurricane
were sheltered at the National Stadium in Kingston.
   ``If we had a house and bed, we would have been out of here long
ago,'' said Gloria Lesly, 47, a mother of five. She said both her
home and the shop where she sold fish were blown away during the
hurricane.
   The refugees were crowded into four large rooms of the stadium,
sleeping on dirty bedding spread over the cement floor and cooking
outside on small gas stoves. The group included about 40 sparsely
clothed barefoot children and several pregnant women.
   Kingston's streets have been cleared of debris, and workers in
cherry-pickers are repairing power lines. City employees and
residents can be seen repairing the roofs of homes, government
buildings and churches, which were either completely blown off or
sustained heavy damage.
   At least half the homes and buildings in Kingston appear
damaged, and most big trees in courtyards and public squares were
blown down.
   The tourist industry suffered about $45 million damage to hotel
roofs and windows, but 85 percent of hotels are back in operation,
and business is expected to return to normal by the end of October,
the Jamaica Tourism Board reported.
   Although most of the island was without power the day after the
hurricane, about 55 percent of the nation's power supply has been
restored and 60 percent of the water supply is running.
   Technicians from several Caribbean nations, the United States,
Puerto Rico, Great Britain and Canada have arrived to help restore
lights by Christmas.
   Most of the $125 million received from the United States will be
used for reparing power lines and water mains, supplying seedlings
for destroyed crops and financing rebuilding efforts, said Bill
Joslan, the local director of the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
   Col. Franklin Thompson, director of the Kingston chapter of the
Salvation Army, said 300,000 pounds of food and medical supplies
donated by New York City's West Indian population is stranded at
JFK International Airport for lack of transportation.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Many Unresolved Complaints After Stock Market Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two out of three small investors who
experienced problems during the stock market crash are still
waiting a year later for their complaints to be resolved, according
to a survey released Sunday by state regulators.
   The North American Securities Administrators Administration said
64 percent of investors responding to a survey said their problems
arising from the collapse of the stock market in October 1987 had
not been resolved.
   ``This confirms our suspicions that small investors were and
remain the invisible victims of the Oct. 19 stock market crash,''
said John Baldwin, the new president of the NASAA, the national
organization for state securities regulators.
   ``A full year after Black Monday, those of us who regulate the
markets at the grass roots level are still finding a surprising
number of dazed investors stumbling through the ruins of their
post-crash finances,'' said Baldwin, who is director of the Utah
Securities Division.
   Baldwin said the organization's survey showed that investors who
had been burned were not rushing back into the market. One out of
seven small investors said they had bailed out of the market
altogether or were holding less than $500 in securities.
   Of those still in the market, two-thirds indicated they had
changed or were planning to change brokerage firms.
   The most common complaint, made by half of the survey
respondents, concerned problems with brokers executing trades late
or getting trades wrong during the hectic period surrounding the
crash. The next most common gripe, made by 33.7 percent of those in
the survey, concerned charges that their broker had misled them.
   Close behind at 30.3 percent were complaints concerning brokers
who put their customers in unsuitable investments such as a highly
risky venture for a customer without a lot of money to lose.
   Asked how long it had taken to resolve their complaints, an
overwhelming 64 percent of those responding said their complaints
were still not resolved. Some 3.6 percent said their problem had
been resolved in one month or less.
   Among the comments made in the survey:
   _ A housewife in Florham Park, N.J., who lost $50,000 invested
in stocks, wrote, ``My financial security has been drastically and
unnecessarily destroyed. Even if I were in a financial position to
invest now, I would never put my money anywhere but in the bank. I
could never have faith in brokers again.''
   _ A Pineville, Ala., engineer, who lost a $197,000 portfolio
accumulated in 20 years of investing, wrote, ``Since the stock
market crash I have been surviving day by day, depressed, trying to
forget about the stock market.''
   _ A retiree in Cape Gable, Fla., who complained that his broker
had never outlined the danger of option trading, said, ``I lost
basically everything we owned. We have now had to go back to work
to earn enough to live own.''
   _ A New York City public relations man wrote, ``This continues
to be one of the most painful situations I've ever experienced _ to
have lost so much money, which was hard-earned and difficult to
save, and to feel that I have nowhere to go for help and don't know
how to rectify the problem or recoup the loss.''
   Not all investors complained about their brokers. A Port Orange,
Fla., investor who complained to the manager of a major discount
brokerage house that his order placed on Oct. 20, 1987, had been
mishandled received a credit for more than $6,500, covering the
full amount of his loss.
   Baldwin said it was important for investors to know what avenues
of help existed for them to get their complaints resolved. He said
one of the best places to look for assistance was the investor's
state securities bureau.
   Baldwin said often state regulators were able to get results
just by getting the brokerage firm and the investor together to
discuss the problem.
   He said arbitration and court suits were also available,
although the survey found that both approaches were time consuming.
Of the cases that went to court, 90 percent of them were still
pending and 87 percent of the cases in arbitration were still
unresolved.
   The survey was based on responses to questionnaires mailed to
2,500 callers selected at random from 15,000 investors who have
used a hotline set up following the crash by the NASAA. A total of
829 investors returned the mailed surveys.
   The association said the typical respondent was a male, aged 55
or older, with a gross income of around $30,000, who had lost
between $1,000 and $5,000 in the stock market crash.
   The survey results were released at the start of the
association's annual convention in Sante Fe, N.M.

<HEAD>Sir Edward Hulton, Founder Of Picture Post, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Edward Hulton, founder of the popular Picture
Post magazine, has died, his nephew said Sunday. He was 81.
   Hulton died Saturday night in his sleep at his London home,
Jocelyn Stevens said. No cause of death was given.
   The Picture Post, founded in 1938, pioneered photojournalism in
Britain, and was bought weekly by millions throughout World War II
and the late 1940s. It folded in June 1957 because of poor
circulation.
   ``He built up a most interesting and excellent assortment of
rather good magazines during his career,'' said Stevens. ``But he
was convinced that television was going to destroy Picture Post
which was his great creation, so he took this extraordinary
decision to kill it.''
   After an early career as a lawyer, Hulton moved into the
publishing business, following in the footsteps of his father who
once owned London's Evening Standard newspaper.
   In 1937 he founded the Hulton Press and published several weekly
journals, including the pocket-sized Lilliput magazine. He sold the
business in 1959.
   Hulton owned the entire village of Salperton in Gloucestershire,
western England, where he tried to set up a model farming community.
   Fiercely pro-European, he became editor in chief of the European
Review, a member of the executive committee of the European League
for Economic Cooperation and a member of the British Council of the
European Movement.
   Hulton was married twice, both times to Russian women, and both
marriages were dissolved.
   Stevens said Hulton's second wife, Princess Nika Yourivietch,
with whom he had lived for the past nine years despite being
divorced, was with him when he died, as was his eldest son.
   Hulton is also survived by another son and a daughter.

<HEAD>Bill Protecting Airline Passengers, Imposing Drug Testing Is
Snarled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill initially intended to improve airline
service is hitting a stone wall as Congress debates controversial
provisions that would protect jobs after industry mergers and
require employee drug testing.
   With the Senate and House hoping to adjourn for the year by
week's end, the chances seem bleak that negotiators from the two
chambers will work out a compromise and persuade President Reagan
to sign it.
   ``It's going to be very difficult to put it together,'' conceded
Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the Senate aviation
subcommittee and one of the legislators trying to shape the bill.
   The measure contains three separate initiatives that each are so
divisive that the legislation seems to be sinking under its own
weight.
   ``Certain members are on and off the reservation,'' said Rep.
Norman Mineta, D-Calif., chairman of the House aviation
subcommittee. ``It's like a chess game.''
   Each chamber passed its own version of the bill last October, at
the height of public fury over deteriorating air service and
concern about safety.
   The legislation would require the airlines to submit monthly
reports to the government on flight delays, lost luggage and other
problems. The Department of Transportation began releasing similar
figures last fall, but the bill would require a more extensive
reporting system.
   This section of the legislation is the basis for problem No. 1.
The House bill is much tougher on the airline industry, containing
one provision, for example, that would force carriers to provide
free tickets to passengers whose bags are lost. Ford says he wants
nothing tougher than the requirements the Transportation Department
has already imposed.
   Both chambers' measures also contain labor-sought language,
opposed by the airline industry, that would protect the jobs of
employees whose jobs are endangered by air carrier mergers.
   These provisions have strong support from most lawmakers, but
paradoxically they are ``the real hang-up'' in the bill, according
to Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee.
   That is because the labor-protection provisions are so strongly
opposed by Reagan that administration officials say it would cause
him to veto the entire measure. The president's opposition seems so
steadfast that Hollings are some other lawmakers would prefer to
remove the language from the bill.
   ``I just don't believe in spinning my wheels just to make TV for
someone,'' he said. ``We've got work to do.''
   Problem No. 3 is over language in the Senate bill _ but omitted
from the House version _ that would set up extensive testing for
drug and alcohol abuse by employees in the airline, railroad and
trucking industries.
   Hollings and Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, the ranking
Republican on the Senate panel, have fought for the testing
provisions all year.
   The initiative was inspired by the Jan. 4, 1987, collision of a
Conrail locomotive with an Amtrak passenger train in Chase, Md., in
which 16 people died and 175 others were hurt.
   Two crewmen on the Conrail engine admitted later that they had
smoked marijuana shortly before the crash.
   But the testing issue has been a difficult one for lawmakers to
resolve.
   Labor groups contend the testing _ particularly random
examinations of workers _ would violate privacy and could be
vulnerable to erroneous laboratory results that would jeopardize
employees' jobs.
   There are also differences over whether rehabilitation programs
should be provided for workers with drug or alcohol problems, who
would pay for them and whether employees who go through them should
be guaranteed getting their jobs back.
   ``How far we're going to be able to go, I don't know,'' Mineta
said late last week.

   The case of Tawana Brawley, whose
story of rape was branded a lie by a grand jury, has left an
atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion between blacks and whites in
the country's most populous area.
   The black teen-ager's account of abduction and attack by six
white men, which became a national symbol of racial tension and
occupied New York state politicians and law enforcement authorities
for much of 1988, was nothing more than a teen-ager's tall tale,
possibly to avoid punishment for staying out late, the panel
concluded.
   Miss Brawley, 16, still insists she's telling the truth.
   But after her initial claim to be a crime victim, family
advisers insisted that she not testify before the grand jury. Her
mother refused to honor a subpoena and faces possible arrest.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it was the biggest hoax that's ever
been perpetrated on the American public,'' said Lt. William McCord,
acting police chief in Wappingers Falls, former home of the
Brawleys.
   The teen-ager was found last Nov. 28 lying in a garbage bag
after being missing for four days. Her body was smeared with feces
and epithets like ``nigger'' and ``KKK'' scrawled in charcoal on
her torso.
   She wrote ``white cop'' on a piece of paper when asked who was
involved.
   Sympathy poured in. Entertainer Bill Cosby offered a $25,000
reward for information.
   Miss Brawley and her family insisted that a legal system
dominated by whites couldn't give justice to blacks.
   Her advisers, the Rev. Al Sharpton and attorneys C. Vernon Mason
and Alton Maddox Jr., called for a special prosecutor to
investigate the case. Gov. Mario Cuomo named Attorney General
Robert Abrams as special prosecutor and a grand jury was empaneled
Feb. 29.
   But while the grand jury tried to investigate in secrecy, the
Brawley team's public statements became more heated and twisted.
Sharpton equated Abrams to Adolf Hitler, and Maddox publicly
suggested the attorney general masturbated in front of a picture of
Miss Brawley.
   And they named names. The lawyers flatly accused two law
enforcement authorities, Dutchess County assistant prosecutor
Steven Pagones and former Fishkill police officer Harry Crist Jr.,
of being involved in the attack, a notion later discounted by the
grand jury. Crist had committed suicide, apparently for unrelated
reasons, shortly after Miss Brawley was found.
   ``At the outset, I think I accepted that, if not all the charges
were true, at least there was something there,'' said Lucille
Pattison, Dutchess County executive. ``I could not believe that the
story was all cut from the same cloth. But the longer the advisers
kept Tawana from talking, the more suspicious I got.''
   The grand jury confirmed such suspicions. It said there was no
evidence Miss Brawley was sexually assaulted but that there was
plenty of evidence _ including clothing fibers and hair samples _
that indicated she had concocted the story herself. The grand jury
also cited evidence of a troubled family life, and suggested that
Miss Brawley had been beaten for earlier transgressions by her
mother and by her stepfather, who once served a prison term for
killing his then-wife.
   Abrams wrote a letter to the state Judicial Discipline Committee
calling for an investigation of Miss Brawley's lawyers for
violations of legal ethics. He also said his office is
investigating Sharpton's activities and said he believed federal
prosecutors are conducting a similar investigation.
   Miss Brawley denounced the grand jury report, declaring: ``I am
not a liar.'' Many of her supporters stood by her.
   ``I have not allowed myself to agree with the minority that
thinks this is a hoax,'' said the Rev. Saul Williams, a Newburgh
minister whose church has held rallies for Miss Brawley. ``I
believe it.''
   Hazel Dukes, chairwoman of the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said she's
distressed by the divisions caused by the case. Dukes said she
accepts the grand jury's conclusions but has a hard time believing
a girl could scrawl such slurs on herself.
   There have been several racial incidents among youths in
Wappingers Falls this autumn, with a half dozen people arrested.
McCord said it's due, in part, to tensions caused by the Brawley
case.
   ``The difficult thing is trying to put things back together
here,'' Pattison said, noting the bitterness has given new
ammunition to bigots.
   ``I think there will be a suspicion for a while, but I think New
Yorkers are a wise, compassionate people,'' Dukes said. ``I would
hope that each case could be judged on its own merit. I hope that
this case could be put behind us and we can concentrate on other
problems.''

<TEXT>
   Ethnic and economic unrest is
destroying the legacy of the late Josip Broz Tito, chipping away at
the power of the Communist Party and leaving many people clamoring
for another strong leader.
   Serbian nationalist rallies that brought hundreds of thousands
to the streets in recent weeks have turned into anti-government
protests by workers chanting that they cannot feed their families
and students demanding a multiparty system and free elections.
   ``The country is ruled by fascists!'' one student told an
anti-government protest in Montenegro last week.
   Just a year ago, such a statement immediately would have brought
the student a lengthy term in jail.
   But the worst economic and political crisis since World War II
has weakened the power of Communist authorities so much that such
declarations and acts of resurgent nationalism are now common.
   Symbols of royalist, pre-Communist Serbia have appeared as
graffiti on Belgrade streets. Songs from the same period, banned
just months ago, are sung openly in restaurants.
   The system Tito bequeathed to Yugoslavia when he died in 1980
was designed to keep this nationalism in check.
   By giving each of Yugoslavia's six republics and two autonomous
provinces broad control of their own affairs and rotating national
offices annually among Communists from the different regions, Tito
prevented one republic from dominating the others.
   But the ethnic splits in this nation of 23 million and the
yawning economic gap between the prosperous north and backward
south have combined to weaken the federal system, so it is
incapable of dealing with the worsening economic crisis.
   Inflation is at 217 percent, unemployment at 15 percent and the
foreign debt at $21 billion. Austerity measures imposed in May to
ensure more foreign loans have slashed wages but not prices, making
life hard for many workers and driving them into strikes and
protests.
   As economic hardship increases, nationalist sentiments grow.
People who thought of themselves as Yugoslav in better times now
think of themselves more as Serbs, Slovenes or Croats and angrily
blame other republics for their own economic demise.
   In Serbia this summer, this nationalist sentiment exploded into
a series of rallies fueled by Serbian discontent over the treatment
of their brethren in Kosovo, an autonomous Serbian province now
dominated by ethnic Albanians.
   The Serbian minority in Kosovo, once the heart of Serbia's
medieval empire, alleges daily harassment by Albanians, 90 percent
of the population. Serbs accuse the majority of seeking union with
neighboring Albania.
   The Serbian rallies quickly turned into a huge show of support
for Serbian Communist Party leader Slobodan Milosevic, an ambitious
47-year-old politician who has dominated Serbia's politics and
media for the past year.
   Milosevic has won popularity by pushing for greater Serbian
control over its two autonomous provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo.
   On Thursday, a combination of his pressure and a 30-hour siege
by tens of thousands at local Communist Party headquarters forced
the resignation of Vojvodina's leadership.
   When demonstrators tried to do the same thing in the southern
republic of Montenegro on Friday night, club-wielding police waded
in to break up the crowd. Police used tear gas in another town in
Montenegro, and authorities clearly feared the unrest was getting
out of hand.
   Many Yugoslavs feel a strong leader like Tito is needed to
control the bubbling ethnic and economic tension. For the Serbs,
Milosevic is such a man, a dynamic speaker who last week
demonstrated his oratorical skills by persuading angry workers
outside the national Parliament to go home.
   But the westward-looking, most prosperous republics of Slovenia
and Croatia will oppose any Serb becoming a leader, and they are
alarmed by Milosevic's use of street rallies to pursue his
political aims.
   The Slovenes also fear another option _ military rule.
   ``We must stop the method of the lynch and more sharply discuss
the responsbility of all of us in legal institutions,'' Slovene
Communist Franc Setinc said in an interview published Sunday.
   Setinc resigned two weeks ago from the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo after coming under heavy fire in media controlled by
Milosevic.
   In Sunday's interview in Tanjug, without mentioning Milosevic by
name, he noted that the unrest is fueled by spontaneous
dissatisfaction over Kosovo, the economy and the Communist Party,
but is not unorganized.
   ``I am not trying to undermine anyone, but I am afraid of the
directors in the wings and their plans. Where is all this leading
us?''

   A white librarian who was dismissed for using
a racial slur before a class in an almost all-black district has
been taken back by the school district after her students decided
they wanted her to stay.
   The Gould School Board dismissed Lois Bostic after she used a
phrase including ``nigger'' while trying to control a class of
sixth-graders.
   Two of the district's 147 students are white.
   ``She didn't mean any harm to it,'' Ray Rainey Jr., Gould High
School senior class president, said Friday while he and other
students celebrated the board's reversal.
   The school board, reacting to a petition signed by 91 parents,
had asked Mrs. Bostic to resign by the week's end.
   But on Wednesday, six students gathered in the library to
discuss the situation.
   ``We decided we wanted her to stay,'' Rainey said.
   The students typed petitions and handed them out, and of the 135
students present Thursday, 124 signed.
   ``I think the parents signed their petition without really
knowing what it was about,'' Rainey said. ``They didn't know Mrs.
Bostic,'' he said of the parents.
   ``My aunt was the one that started the first petition,'' Rainey
said. `But my father said to do what I felt was right.''
   Alan Minor, school board president, was surprised by the
students' efforts.
   ``I thought there had been anger and animosity among the
students,'' he said. Instead, ``the anger came exclusively from the
parents.''
   Mrs. Bostic was overwhelmed by the students' reaction.
   ``I was dumbfounded when I found out how many students signed,''
she said.
   Mrs. Bostic, who is in her first year at the community of 1,670
in southeastern Arkansas, said she had heard the word nigger used
in conversation between two black students and got the impression
that it was acceptable among them.
   She also said she used the word for shock value to try to get
through to the students.
   Rainey said most students didn't take offense.
   ``She was saying not to act that way,'' he said.
   ``I've become a hero for this,'' Mrs. Bostic said. ``And it's
not right, because I made a stupid mistake.''

   This year's presidential campaign
between Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis has
made little contribution to the English language, say editors at
Merriam-Webster dictionaries.
   ``It's been dull,'' said senior editor James G. Lowe, whose
lexicographers have been keeping close tabs on campaign rhetoric in
hopes of finding new words.
   Since the days of ``caucus,'' an Algonquin Indian term that
entered the American political vocabulary in the 1760s, and down
through ``mugwump,'' ``power broker,'' ``suffragette,''
``smoke-filled rooms,'' ``arm-twisting,'' ``wheeler-dealer'' and
``dirty tricks,'' national politics and particularily presidential
campaigns have been a rich source of new words, he said.
   Although the candidates have revived some old terms, such as
``limousine liberal,'' coined by Mario Procaccino during his 1969
campaign against New York City Mayor John Lindsay, they have come
up with little new.
   With only a few weeks of the campaign left, Lowe sees only
``scam'' used as a combining term _ as in ``Iranscam,''
``Contrascam,'' ``debatescam'' _ as enduring and ``pastel
patriotism'' as a possible starter.
   According to one version, ``pastel patriots'' were what the
Republicans called the Democrats for decorating their convention
arena not in traditional red, white and blue but in hues that
looked red, white and blue on television.
   ``I don't know whether to blame their speech writers, but the
candidates haven't been talking about issues,'' said Lowe, pointing
out that this campaign is devoid of New Deals, Square Deals,
Hoovervilles and frontiers of any kind.
   ``Their forte is one-liners,'' he said. ``It's a quick way of
getting attention, but as soon as the campaign is over those
one-liners will be forgotten.''
   Even the press has been uninspired, according to Lowe.
   ``It's very often the journalists that invent words,'' Lowe
said. ``Time and Newsweek magazines, because of their breezy style
and need to condense information, have been particularily fertile
sources for us over the years. But not in this campaign.''
   A new word gets into Webster's simply by being used repeatedly
in newspapers, magazines and other contemporary writing. Lowe's
staff spends most of its time reading and noting new words and new
uses on citation cards, and when a term builds up sufficient
citations over an extended period of time, it is added to the
dictionary.
   The test involves being more than a one-campaign phenomenon,
such as former Vice President Spiro Agnew's ``radiclib,'' which
quickly amassed a pile of citations following his 1970 speech and
has been heard little since.
   The Reagan years in general have provided slim linguistic
pickings, Lowe said. Two terms that have stuck and moved beyond
their political origins are ``exit poll,'' which came into popular
use in 1980 when West Coast television viewers learned before their
polls closed that Reagan had defeated Jimmy Carter, and ``yuppy,''
which blossomed with Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's campaign for the
Democratic nomination in 1984.
   Not only has the current crop of candidates added little to the
vocabulary, Republican vice presidential hopeful Dan Quayle even
tried, unsuccessfully, to get Webster's to delete a word.
   Quayle took offense last year at supplementary definitions for
the word ``hoosier'' in the Third New International Dictionary,
which pointed out that besides referring to a resident of Indiana,
the noun can refer to an ``awkward, unhandy or unskilled person.''
As a verb the word can mean ``to loaf or botch a job.''
   Quayle suggested the dictionary company define ``hoosier'' as
``someone who is quick, smart, resourceful, skillful, a winner.''
   William A. Llewellyn, president of Merriam-Webster, declined to
revise the dictionary entry. He pointed out that many words have
more than one meaning and ``we in the dictionary business cannot
arbitrarily decide that we will enter only one of those senses.''
   ``Dictionary makers do not truly define words,'' Llewellyn said.
``Rather, they record the language as it is used.''

<HEAD>Scientists Find Vast Population of Plants, Animals in Polar Ice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vast and previously undiscovered population
of tiny plants and animals lives in hollowed pores carved through
the sea ice that forms annually around Antarctica, researchers said
in studies released Sunday.
   Cornelius Sullivan, co-leader of a National Science Foundation
polar study expedition, said scientists studying the sea ice found
large and thriving populations of krill, a small shrimp-like
animal, grazing on one-celled plants and animals that live in the
ice pores.
   ``The sea ice is a place where for a small expenditure of energy
the krill can avoid predators and live in a rich pastureland,''
said Sullivan, the director of marine biological research at the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
   Existence of the vast population of plants and animals living in
the ice came as a surprise to researchers who spent 70 days during
the heart of the Antarctic winter studying the polar ice.
   During the winter, sea water freezes to a six-foot thickness and
forms a pack extending 1,100 miles from the Antarctic mainland. The
total ice formed around the South Pole continent is roughly 11
million square miles, three times the area of the United States.
   Each spring, 80 percent of the ice melts, creating a
nutrient-rich layer of water that is filled with small plants and
animals, and with the birds and mammals that feed on them.
   But the amount of life that existed within the ice during the
winter months was an unanticipated discovery, said Sullivan in a
telephone interview.
   He said the scientists found that the sea ice was not solid, but
was pocked with channels, ``rather like Swiss cheese.'' These
channels form as hairlike pores when the ice freezes and then are
enlarged by wave action, said Sullivan.
   Once the channels are in place, they form a home for one-celled
plants called algae that live in the microscopic spaces between the
ice crystals.
   Sullivan said the algae is ``remarkable'' because it is able to
perform photosynthesis in temperatures at or below freezing.
Sunlight strikes the ice five to six hours a day in the winter and
enough of the light penetrates the ice to allow the algae to grow.
   The ice algae, he said, has adapted to the frigid temperatures
and will ``fall apart'' if allowed to warm to typical room
temperatures.
   Once the algae has bloomed in the ice, Sullivan said, the pores
in the ice surface becomes home to bacteria, protozoans and
amoebas, many of which feed on the algae. The krill, free swimming
from the ocean, then make their way into the channels and feed on
the other small ice creatures.
   Divers, exploring the ice from below, were able to probe the ice
channels and bring out samples of the life there.
   ``Almost all of the krill we found were in larval or juvenile
stages, which gives us the idea that the krill are using the ice as
a giant nursery for early development stages,'' said Sullivan.
   Some studies indicate that the ice pack around Antarctica may be
shrinking because the Earth is slowly warming. If this is true,
said Sullivan, it could have an impact on krill, which is a key
animal in the polar ecosystem.
   Adult krill live in vast schools and are a favorite food of
whale, penguin and seal.
   ``Krill is a key species that others depend on,'' said Sullivan.
A decline in the krill population could affect the populations of
other animals, he said, ``because they are obviously all linked.''

<HEAD>Canada Gets Tough on U.S. Fishing Vessels Caught In Wrong Waters</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Name Flewwelling in the 6th graf is cq.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada has lost its patience with U.S. fishermen
poaching in its territorial water and, after years of fruitless
pursuit, has resorted to firing machine gun warnings at one boat
and boarding another.
   On Oct. 1, Canadian fisheries officials fired a .50-caliber
machine gun across the bow of a New Bedford scalloper, the Donna
Lynn, and chased it for six hours before giving up 85 miles east of
Nantucket.
   The vessel has yet to return to port, but Canada has asked the
U.S. State Department to investigate and press charges against the
vessel's skipper.
   The conflict goes back to 1984 when the World Court divided up
the thousands of miles of the Georges Bank in the Gulf of Maine.
When the court was through, the United States had fishing rights in
two-thirds of the area. But the 9,000 square miles that went to
Canada turned out to have the lion's share of the fish.
   For about three years, Canadian officials simply gave chase when
they found American vessels where they didn't belong. Late last
year they decided to crack down, arming patrol boats with machine
guns and threatening to disable vessels if necessary.
   ``We've been very careful to be sure that all these steps are
well known to the whole fishing industry. Obviously there are very
controlled sets of procedures in place, which may result in an
armed boarding _ very similar to those your Coast Guard uses,''
said Peter Flewwelling, chief of surveillance and enforcement for
the Canadian federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
   ``There are many sensitivities that come to play, and so
consequently there is due concern,'' Flewwelling said in a
telephone interview from Ottawa.
   U.S. policy is to neither assist nor interfere in Canadian law
enforcement.
   ``Of course it is of concern,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr. Terry
Hart, chief of law enforcement for the Northeast district. More
than 11,000 U.S. fishing vessels are licensed to work in his
district, which runs from New Jersey to the Canadian border.
   ``We are always concerned about the safety of life at sea. We
put out a release last winter notifying (the U.S. fishing fleet)
that this is what the Canadians intend to do.''
   The Coast Guard even plies Canadian water to find U.S.
offenders, Hart said.
   ``We go on the Canadian side. If we find U.S. vessels, we
document the violation. We tell them they are in violation and
taking a risk,'' he said.
   Hart said he knows of no Canadian vessels fishing where they
don't belong. ``We've never seen any over there. And probably for a
very good reason: there's better fishing on their side of the
line.''
   If penalized in this country, violators risk loss of their boat,
a year in jail and up to $10,000 fine.
   The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service and Coast Guard plans
to board the Donna Lynn when it returns to port, he said.
Information gathered then and the Canadian allegations will be
delivered to a federal magistrate for possible prosecution.
   This month's incident was the second in three months.
   In July, the Mary Elizabeth, a New Bedford dragger, was seized
and the captain arrested after Canadian authorities claimed the
boat was fishing in Canadian water. The captain and crew denied the
charges, insisting they were illegally boarded and were fishing in
international water.
   The Donna Lynn allegedly was discovered three nautical miles
inside Canadian water.

<HEAD>Bush's National Security Adviser Shuns Publicity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His name didn't appear on the list of foreign
policy heavy hitters who were recruited as advisers to George
Bush's presidential campaign, and his face hasn't appeared in any
photographs of the Republican nominee on the campaign trail.
   Donald Gregg, a 60-year-old retired CIA agent, studiously avoids
publicity as he labors in an office adjacent to the White House as
the vice president's national security adviser. It is a role he
might continue to play if Bush is elected president in November.
   Gregg has survived lingering questions about his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, although his name surfaced again last month in
a congressional report charging that CIA specialists ran a covert
propaganda campaign to arouse public support for President Reagan's
Central-America policy.,
   ``He's a loyal man, loyal to Bush, loyal to his country,'' said
retired Adm. Daniel Murphy, the vice president's former chief of
staff.
   ``He's done a good job,'' Murphy said, reflecting the view taken
by Bush when he is asked about Gregg.
   Madeleine Albright, a Georgetown University professor who
advises Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis on foreign policy, said,
``I think generally there remain questions about the kind of people
that the vice president surrounds himself with.''
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee staff asserted Sept. 13 that
CIA operatives, along with military experts in intelligence and
psychological operations, improperly used the State Department's
Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean, for
the alleged propaganda campaign.
   The report said that on Gregg's recommendation, former CIA
propaganda expert Walter Raymond Jr. was assigned to the White
House National Security Council unit that directed the public
diplomacy office.
   The staff suggested that the committee investigate whether the
agents used the State Department ``as a cover for a domestic
operation which went far beyond the legal and ethical scope of
their authority.''
   The committee has not yet acted on the report. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the report as a rehash of
earlier allegations.
   Gregg refused requests for an interview. Steve Hart, a spokesman
in the vice president's office, said, ``I think it's fair to say
that the focus is on the (presidential) campaign right now, and Mr.
Gregg prefers that it stay that way.''
   Gregg's name figured in other disclosures stemming from the
clandestine sale of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985 and 1986 and the
subsequent diversion of proceeds to assist Nicaraguan Contras, at a
time when Congress had banned military aid to the rebels.
   In mid-December 1986, Bush published a chronology of meetings
between Gregg and Felix Rodriguez, a former CIA official and
counter-insurgency expert who was identified as a coordinator of
supply flights to the Contras. The chronology showed they met at
least 10 times starting Nov. 3, 1983.
   Bush's office has said repeatedly that it was was never involved
in ``directing, coordinating or approving'' military aid to the
Contras.
   Bush called Gregg to task for failing to inform the vice
president of his meetings with Rodriguez.
   Fitzwater, who was Bush's press secretary in late 1986, said
``Gregg apparently had taken it upon himself to put Felix in touch
with various people. He had not previously told the vice president.
... I think the vice president feels he should have been told.''
   Nonetheless, Bush has consistently expressed confidence in
Gregg, a 30-year CIA veteran who headed the National Security
Council's intelligence branch when Murphy hired him to become the
vice president's national security adviser in August 1982.
   Murphy said he would not rule out the possibility that Gregg, a
former CIA station chief in Vietnam who speaks Japanese fluently,
might keep his current job in a Bush administration. Other foreign
policy advisers to the Bush campaign include former Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger and former national security advisers
Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft.
   ``I'm sure he (Gregg) is on a short list,'' Murphy said.
``There's no reason why he shouldn't be on the short list or near
the top of it. He's done a good job.''

<HEAD>Federal Agents Keeping An Eye On Bakkers' Fund Raising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Jim and Tammy Bakker have been
asking for money to regain control of PTL and set up a new
television ministry, federal agents have been keeping a close watch
on their fund-raising tactics.
   ``I imagine they're checking very carefully to see what he's
doing,'' said Hendersonville lawyer Jim Toms, one of Bakker's
attorneys. He said federal authorities have questioned him about
the recent fund raising.
   ``They're looking at it critically, but are keeping an open
mind,'' Toms said. ``They're giving him room to see what he is
really going to do.''
   The focus on the latest fund-raising effort comes in the midst
of a 14-month-long federal grand jury investigation into possible
wrongdoing by the former PTL president and founder and his top
aides.
   Bakker won't disclose how much his latest efforts have raised.
But Toms said he is keeping federal authorities posted on Bakker's
activities and has offered to let Internal Revenue Service agents
inspect Bakker's financial records.
   In a fund-raising campaign launched last month, the Bakkers
mailed about 200,000 packets to potential donors across the nation.
   Cards in the packets spell out their intentions: ``Your gifts
are used to support Jim and Tammy and all their ministry. They have
the discretion to allocate your gift where needed. Jim and Tammy
have a nonprofit ministry, New Covenant Partners and Church, and
are proceeding to apply for tax exemption, but your gift is not tax
deductible at this time.''
   Charles Alexander, the Justice Department prosecutor heading the
grand jury investigation, declined to say if agents are asking
about the Bakkers' latest fund-raising techniques.
   ``I have no comment at all,'' Alexander told The Charlotte
Observer. ``I don't even acknowledge the existence of an
investigation.''
   Les Witmer, an IRS spokesman in Atlanta, said: ``Obviously,
based on previous activities, the Internal Revenue Service would be
very interested in the fund-raising activities of the new
corporation.''
   The IRS in April revoked PTL's tax-exempt status on the ground
that Bakker operated it mostly to make money _ not to minister.
   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after admitting a
one-time sexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Three months later, PTL filed for reorganization under federal
bankruptcy laws, and a bankruptcy judge has since ordered the
ministry to sell its assets _ the Heritage USA Christian retreat
and theme park, the PTL satellite TV network and 1,700 undeveloped
acres of land.
   Bakker's bid to buy the assets fell through last month. Last
week, Stephen Mernick, a Toronto businessman, won the bidding for
PTL with an offer of $115 million.
   Toms said contributions sent to help Bakker buy back PTL won't
be used for anything else unless contributors give permission.
   The Bakkers say they haven't given up on their dream to buy back
PTL, but say they are soliciting contributions for a new television
ministry.
   Donations will be used to pay Bakker as pastor of the New
Covenant Church.
   ``Clearly, he will be paid as pastor,'' Toms said. ``and will be
provided with the normal ministerial allowances _ for
transportation and the like.''
   But Toms said Bakker will not use donations to support the
luxurious lifestyle he was accustomed to while president of PTL.
   ``He isn't going to go out and pick up sticks for people to beat
him with by buying something that people will criticize him for,''
Toms said.
   Bakker admits he made mistakes at PTL and says this time will be
different.
   ``There will be strict financial controls,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Sunday reported its first AIDS
death, that of a pregnant prostitute from Leningrad, and
authorities may publish her photograph to alert her sexual partners.
   The 29-year-old woman died Sept. 5 of pneumonia following a
26-pound weight loss, chronic tonsillitis and bronchitis and a
serious decline in the count of her immune system's T-cells, the
labor newspaper Trud reported.
   All are common symptoms of aquired immune deficiency syndrome,
and the newspaper noted that epidemiologists were incensed that the
woman's doctors failed to diagnose AIDS before she died.
   They are now trying to locate the victim's sexual partners to
determine who else might be infected with the disease, and
authorities are considering publishing the woman's photograph to
alert her partners, Trud said.
   She was registered as a night school student and as a worker at
a factory, but police said she earned her living as a prostitute
for foreigners.
   Soviet officials say they have identified 83 AIDS carriers but
only one person who has developed the deadly disease. However, they
say other cases may have been diagnosed incorrectly.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Mulroney Hits Campaign Trail Looking for Free Trade Mandate</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is leaving little
to chance while he campaigns for a Progressive Conservative Party
victory and for implementing a free trade agreement with the United
States.
   The prime minister's opponents in the heated three-way race for
the Nov. 21 election say a Mulroney victory would mean nothing less
than selling out Canada to its more powerful and richer neighbor.
   The traditional rough-and-tumble of Canadian campaigning was
altered this year by Mulroney's insistence on carefully controlled
public appearances and, at least in the first week of the campaign,
only rare departures from the script.
   Mulroney's two opponents describe their efforts to block the
free trade agreement his government negotiated with the United
States as the fight of the century.
   The deal would eliminate all tariffs between the two countries
end eventually put Canada's 26 million people in open competition
with the 245 million people of the United States. It would mean the
dismantling of a system of high tariffs that dates back to the 19th
century.
   ``It's a cause of my life to save Canada from this deal,''
Liberal Party leader John Turner has told Canadians. ``This is more
than an election. It is your future.''
   Ed Broadbent of the socialist New Democratic Party has
reiterated his party's traditional stand against free trade
agreements.
   Early polls show the Progressive Conservatives ahead in the
campaign, which Mulroney insists should not be simply a referendum
on the trade issue but rather an endorsement of his record during
four years of national leadership.
   The prime minister has the advantage of prosperity during his
administration and optimistic economic forecasts. The unemployment
rate for September, announced Friday, showed a further decrease
from 8 percent to 7.8 percent, considered low for Canada.
   A Gallup Poll taken during the 48 hours after Mulroney called
the election Oct. 1 indicated the Conservatives with 43 percent
support, Liberals with 33 percent and New Democrats with 22 percent.
   Such an outcome could give the Conservatives 295 seats in the
House of Commons, up from the 208 seats they held in the 282-member
House that was just dissolved. The Liberals held 40 seats and the
New Democrats had 33 with one vacancy.
   ``Given the volatility, given the fickleness of Canadian voters,
it's possible the Conservatives can stumble and lose their lead,''
said Sylvia Bashevkin, a political science professor at the
University of Toronto.
   Ms. Bashevkin, who is writing a book about Canadian nationalism,
said in an interview that the intensity of the free trade
discussion is rooted in ``a visceral issue in Canadian society'' _
that the larger, more powerful United States could overwhelm huge
but sparsely populated Canada.
   ``Nationalists of all sorts unite to speak out against any loss
of sovereignty,'' Ms. Bashevkin said.
   Opponents of the free trade agreement raise a range of fears
from environmental dangers and the exploitation of energy resources
to the potential loss of a fragile national identity. They also see
threats to Canada's extensive health care and social service
network.
   At the heart of the debate are fears that what is considered a
more aggressive American lifestyle could move north, pushing aside
Canadian traditions that value a sense of community.
   Mulroney says the fears are unjustified. Charging the opposition
with pursuing ``some nostalgic version of a past that perhaps never
existed,'' he says the creation of a larger North American market
is needed to assure Canada's future prosperity.
   A Conservative majority in the next Parliament would remove any
remaining blocks to the creation of a North American free trade
zone on Jan. 1.
   Both opposition parties say they would tear up the deal.
   The U.S. Senate approved the agreement with Canada, the United
States' top trading partner, by 83-9 last month. At least 70
percent of the $150 billion in trade each year between the
countries already is tariff-free.
   The Gallup Poll found free trade to be the dominant issue among
Canadian voters.
   Mulroney, 49, is a former corporate lawyer and leader of his
party since 1983.
   Although scandals that touched eight of his ministers reduced
the Conservatives' standing in the polls sharply during the first
three years of his term, Mulroney appears to have distanced himself
from those troubles and surged ahead.

<HEAD>Anti-Semitic Letter Provokes Long Island Conservatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Suffolk County district attorney's office is
investigating the origin of an anti-Semitic letter that has
embroiled leaders of the Conservative Party in internal strife.
   The Long Island county's Conservative Party chairman, Pasquale
J. Curcio, apologized Friday to the American Jewish Congress for
the unsigned letter, which urged the defeat of two judgeship
candidates because they are Jewish.
   ``It turns my stomach,'' said Curcio, who was elected chairman
Oct. 2. ``The Conservative Party is not anti-Semitic and we had
nothing to do with that.''
   Curcio and the party's vice chairman, John Andrew Kay, accused
former party chairwoman Elaine Leirer of writing the letter, which
Curcio said was mailed to at least a dozen Conservative Party
members before the September primary election.
   Mrs. Leirer, who lost her chairmanship in a bitter battle with
Curcio and Kay, strongly denied having written the letter and said
the two men wrote it to discredit her. They denied the charge.
   The letter, written on plain stationery under the heading
``Official Conservative Announcement from the Chairwoman,'' urged
party members to vote for four non-Jewish candidates for judgeships.
   ``Do not let the Jews run Suffolk County,'' it concluded. ``Stay
with the chairwoman. Reject Jew lovers Curcio and Kay.''
   Both of the judicial candidates named in the letter, David
Freundlich and Morton Weissman, won their Conservative Party
primaries and are also running as Republicans in the general
election.
   The chief of the district attorney's rackets bureau, John E.
Holownia, said the letter was being investigated.

   Some 300 people turned out to jeer
fired National Security Council aide Oliver North while he urged
more than 1,000 Christian business leaders to fight the ``alien and
godless philosophy'' of communism.
   ``I don't think (North) cares one way or another'' about
protesters, admitted rally organizer Mitch Diamond, outside an
auditorium where North addressed members of the Christian
Businessmen of Silicon Valley on Saturday.
   Some of the protesters dressed as a Moslem ayatollah and as
President Reagan. Many carried signs denouncing North's clandestine
efforts to sell weapons to Iran and secretly funnel profits to
U.S.-backed Contra rebels battling the leftist Sandinista
government of Nicaragua.
   Mary Ellen Furia of nearby Los Gatos and Ethel and Jack Ballad
of Saratoga showed up with signs in support of North, who faces
trial next year on 16 federal charges of conspiring to defraud the
government.
   ``Ollie North is our man. What Congress won't do, Ollie can,''
read their signs.
   ``We knew there would be protests against him, and we wanted to
show we're behind him,'' Furia said.

   Paola Ricas will return to Italy to
describe in her gourmet magazine foods made from U.S. soybeans.
N.G. Myndru will return to his farm in the Soviet Union to oversee
livestock feeding trials using U.S. soybean meal.
   Product promotion, including sponsoring visits by Italian food
journalists and Soviet agricultural experts, is a key feature of
the U.S. soybean industry.
   ``We raise high quality grain here in Illinois and we hope we
can meet your needs _ for your people and your diet,'' Champaign
County farmer Lee Eichhorst said at a recent dinner honoring
visiting Soviets.
   Money contributed by farmers enables the American Soybean
Association to carry out a wide range of programs aimed at creating
new uses and markets for American soybeans. Some money also comes
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   ``We have invited the Italian food journalists to the States to
acquaint them with soybeans, and hopefully they will go home and
write about them,'' said ASA official Roger Leysen, who was
visiting Illinois but is based in Belgium.
   Ms. Ricas, editor of La Cucina Italiana, was especially
interested in new foods made from soy.
   ``I saw the pizza with the soybean flour and the ice cream,''
she said. ``This is new, and it is very important to me to taste
these things.''
   The Italian journalists visited a farm where soybeans are grown,
the Chicago Board of Trade where beans are bought and sold, a
factory that makes salad dressing, University of Illinois
laboratories where new soy foods are developed, supermarkets and
export facilities.
   The idea is to show potential customers that the United States
is the largest and most reliable soybean supplier. Illinois is the
nation's No. 1 soybean state.
   ``The Italians are growing soybeans but not enough to meet their
demand,'' Leysen said. ``We still need publicity in Italy to
increase demand even more.''
   However, the major use of soybeans is in livestock rations, and
ASA has been conducting feeding demonstrations on large cooperative
farms in the Soviet Union.
   Soy meal is added to Soviet corn, which is chopped and fed green
because their growing season is too short to produce mature ears of
corn.
   ``The tests showed the ASA formula worked,'' said Mansfield
farmer Ken Dalenberg, noting faster weight gain and better quality
meat compared with the traditional Soviet diet for hogs. ``These
promotions and feeding trials should build markets for U.S.
soybeans.''
   The Soviets, including top officials from huge state and
cooperative farms where feeding tests are conducted, came to the
United States to see how farmers raise soybeans and hogs.
   ``We are all involved in the production of something very
necessary for this world _ food,'' said Myndru, chairman of a
50,000-acre cooperative farm and member of the Supreme Soviet. ``We
are ... doing our best to get good results like you. If a farmer is
good, we say he is like an American farmer.''
   Myndru encouraged exchange visits between American and Soviet
farmers and agricultural researchers.
   Aleks Cerne, associate director of the ASA office in Vienna,
travelled with the Soviets. He said there is a great potential for
increased soybean sales to the Soviet Union, but cautioned that it
will take time and cooperation.
   ``Markets will come very slowly, but trade is a two-way
street,'' Cerne said. ``We sell them 10 times as much agricultural
product as we buy from them.''

<HEAD>One Year With Indian Peacekeeping Soldiers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAFFNA, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian peacekeeping forces landed on
this island nation one year ago to try to end fighting by minority
Tamils demanding an independent state. Once regarded as heroes, the
Indians have become the enemy.
   ``When we saw the Indian troops arrive here, we greeted them
with garlands as our saviors,'' said Parameswari, a Tamil housewife
who spoke on condition that her family name not be used.
   ``We realized our mistake,'' she said. ``The Indians launched an
operation not only to kill the Tamil Tigers, but Tamil civilians.''
   Jaffna, about 165 miles north of the capital of Colombo, is a
city under siege.
   On Oct. 3, two pistol shots fired near a crowded bus stop killed
two young Tamil men. The streets emptied as Indian troops dressed
in camouflage gear drove into the city in military vehicles and
retrieved the bodies.
   The next day, three Indian soldiers died when a booby-trapped
bicycle exploded. Indian troops retaliated by shooting and killing
a young Tamil fleeing the scene.
   A group of Tamil boys, about 12 years old, ran through the
streets warning residents: ``Do not allow anybody to go into the
town. The Indians are coming.''
   ``We have gone through World War I and now we are in the midst
of World War II,'' said one Tamil woman, who did not want her name
used.
   The presidents of Sri Lanka and India _ which became involved in
the conflict because of its own 60 million Tamils _ signed an
accord July 29, 1987, aimed at ending the 5-year-old campaign by
militant Tamils for a separate nation in the northern and eastern
provinces.
   The mostly Hindu Tamils, 18 percent of the island's 16 million
people, claim they are discriminated against by the majority
Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population and
control the government and the military.
   An estimated 8,500 people have died since the insurgency began
in 1983, including an estimated 1,000 civilians and at least 625
Indian soldiers.
   The peace accord was aimed at giving the Tamils more autonomy in
exchange for laying down arms.
   On Oct. 10, 1987, the first of an estimated 50,000 Indian troops
arrived in Sri Lanka across the Palk Straits, a waterway off the
southeast coast of India that separates the countries. The soldiers
were ordered to neutralize the most powerful of the rebel groups,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam, who rejected the peace accord.
   An estimated 47,000 Indian soldiers remain in Sri Lanka, and the
Indian government says they will stay there until Sri Lanka's
president, Junius R. Jayewardene, says they are not needed.
   Tamils in Jaffna have mixed feeling about the presence of the
peacekeeping forces _ many want the Indians to leave, but others
aren't sure.
   ``They have been here for the past 12 months and our problems
have become worse. What will happen if they leave is anybody's
guess,'' said Sinnathamby Murugaveli, a student at Jaffna
University.
   Some Sri Lankans fear that if the Indian soldiers leave, they
will leave behind arms for some of the six moderate Tamil groups
who have helped hunt down the Tigers.
   ``This will lead to a fresh bout of bloodletting, giving an
excuse for the Sri Lankan armed forces to take over where the
Indians left, leaving us Tamils back at square one,'' said a
professor at Jaffna University, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Newspaper Blasts Officials For Mishandling Train Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper on Sunday accused officials in a
central Russian city of failing to report the true extent of
devastation in a train crash and explosion that killed at least
four people last week.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, the newspaper of the Young Communist
League, also said there were similarities between the Sverdlovsk
accident and another train accident that killed about 100 people in
June.
   It called for an investigation by the local prosecutor, implying
that criminal negligence or sabotage might be involved.
   ``In these revealing days, mixed with human grief are a lack of
coordination, shirking responsibility, confusion and unconcealed
red tape,'' the newspaper said.
   On Tuesday, two freight cars loaded with explosives broke loose
and smashed into a coal train adjacent to an oil tank yard in
Sverdlovsk, a city 850 miles east of Moscow.
   The resulting double explosion killed at least four people,
according to initial reports, and blew a crater 30 feet deep and
180 feet wide. Komsomolskaya Pravda said its reporter found that at
least five people died.
   In Arzamas, 240 miles east of Moscow, a train carrying
explosives blew up June 4. The newspaper said that train was just
three minutes away from an oil tank yard.
   ``Why do trains full of dangerous materials keep blowing up near
oil storage areas?'' it asked.
   The newspaper said Sverdlovsk officials had no idea of the
extent of the tragedy and didn't know anything about the victims,
except their last names.
   The newspaper said its reporter discovered 838 people sought
medical care and that 10 were in critical condition. Five lost
their eyesight, the report said.
   Initial reports said 280 people sought medical care.
   Authorities in Sverdlovsk originally reported 12 dwellings and 8
other buildings destroyed, but the newspaper said 20 apartment
buildings were destroyed and 14 damaged.
   The article said there was no evidence a law requiring that the
explosives be guarded by four people was observed.
   Soviet officials have suppressed information on accidents for
decades, and newspapers have only recently begun covering them
under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness.
   But even under glasnost, some disasters have been hushed up.
   When a fire and explosion rocked the Chernobyl nuclear power
station on April 26, 1986, Soviet authorities denied the accident
for days and were forced into acknowledging it only after radiation
contamination was discovered hundreds of miles away in Western
Europe. The accident killed 31 people.

<HEAD>Post-Debate Quayle Says He's Become GOP `Lightning Rod'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 5th graf: Republican pollster ....; to CORRECT that
Phillips is a Republican political analyst.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle was supposed to show the country
last week that he ``has no horns,'' as one adviser said. Instead,
the Republican vice presidential nominee remains the most
controversial candidate on either party's ticket.
   He admitted as much when he observed Friday that he had become
``the lightning rod for the campaign.''
   Aides say Quayle's debate with Democratic rival Lloyd Bentsen, a
confrontation many voters seem to think Quayle lost, has not
affected the campaign strategy for the Indiana senator or his
relationship with GOP nominee George Bush.
   But some Bush aides have been quoted as saying privately that
his debate performance was assessed as a negative. Bush himself
rarely mentions Quayle during campaign appearances unless he is
responding to reporters' questions.
   Conservative Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips,
interviewed Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said there is no
doubt that voters, including many Republicans, are ``nervous''
about Quayle.
   ``It's very clear that the Democrats did get a dynamic out of
the Bentsen-Quayle debate,'' Phillips said. ``The question is how
much the Democrats, whose campaign strategy so far this year has
often been somewhat inept, can take advantage of that opening.''
   Democratic pollster Peter Hart, interviewed on the same show,
said comparisons of public and private polls before and after the
debate show a nationwide switch of 2 or 3 percentage points in
favor of the Democratic ticket.
   During an impromptu news conference on his campaign plane late
Friday, Quayle rejected suggestions that he is viewed as a
liability by the Bush camp.
   ``I'd like to find out who did say that,'' he said. ``I think I
might have some influence on their job security.''
   As for Bush, ``I don't know how he could have defended me any
more vigorously,'' Quayle said.
   ``He thought the debate was outstanding. He called me right
after the debate and he said `home run _ an absolute home run! And
he believes that and still believes that. ... I don't know how he
could be any more vigorous in his support.''
   Some GOP officials have seen Quayle, 41, as a liability almost
from the moment he was selected by Bush at the party convention in
New Orleans in mid-August.
   Intense media focus on his military service, academic record and
personal life, combined with his youth and his tendency to
misspeak, created the image of a lightweight candidate, especially
when compared with the patrician, 67-year-old Bentsen.
   Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III told reporters before
the Oct. 5 debate in Omaha, Neb., that Quayle would have to show
millions of television viewers that he ``has no horns'' and was
``steady, serious and substantive.''
   Quayle generally performed well, although he seemed stumbling
and hesitant when asked repeatedly what he would do if he had to
assume the presidency.
   Democrats immediately capitalized on that with two TV ads, one
depicting Bush advisers regretting the choice of Quayle and another
conjuring up the specter of a Quayle presidency.
   Quayle responded by telling reporters that his new campaign role
was to take the heat for Bush and that in any event, the voters
ultimately choose between Bush and Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis, not their running mates.
   Quayle insisted that he _ not Bush's campaign strategists _ had
assigned him the role of lightning rod.
   ``I'm going to take all the heat and that's just fine. We'll let
George Bush have a free ride,'' he said.
   Asked why Bush was not the one to respond to the ads, Quayle
replied, ``They're attacking me.''
   Whether the debate will prove to be any sort of campaign
watershed remains to be seen. Aides say their strategy remains the
same.
   Quayle will continue to campaign in the party's traditional base
as well as key swing states such as Michigan and Ohio, which he
will visit this week. He will continue to raise money for the
ticket, court local and regional media coverage and make Dukakis
his primary target for attack.
   If anything, aides say, Quayle's campaign schedule will get
busier between now and Nov. 8.
   ``This guy is going to be playing a major role in helping this
ticket get elected,'' said David Prosperi, Quayle's spokesman.
``This is the big run for the finish line.''
   Quayle's reception on his post-debate campaign travels has been
good, although he has appeared mostly at college and high school
events that resemble student pep rallies.
   Bush's running mate seems more relaxed around reporters since
the debate, although he makes no secret of his resentments over
press coverage of his campaign.
   He playfully turned a paint sprayer on reporters as he toured a
Chattanooga, Tenn., technical school recently. ``That's for all
those articles you've written about me,'' he said.
   But Quayle didn't seem flustered during his airborne session
with reporters Friday, even though the exchange was testy at times.
``I figured out, you weren't all that bad,'' he told them.

<HEAD>Public Housing Residents Cheer Shooting of Guards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Residents of a crime-ridden public
housing project cheered when the body of a security guard was
carried to an ambulance after he was gunned down in a hail of
bullets.
   ``When they brought (him) out, people started clapping and
saying, `Hurrah,''' said Acorn housing complex resident Gustina
Hamilton, 51.
   A second guard remained in critical condition Sunday following
the attack by several men who sprayed the complex's security office
with bullets from assault-style weapons, police said. As many as 60
bullets were pumped into the room within two minutes during the
assault Friday night.
   ``When I heard one guard had been killed, I didn't feel anything
whatsoever and I know this is wrong,'' added Hamilton, who said her
son was hurt in a scuffle with guards two months ago.
   Residents of the 673-unit complex have been complaining for a
year that guards hired by Prostaf Security to chase out drug
dealers have instead brutalized residents.
   In August of last year, about 80 people signed a petition
alleging that guards had beaten at least 12 residents and otherwise
harassed them, particularly after management imposed an 11 p.m.
curfew in an effort to curtail crime.
   Police said they had no suspects in the death of guard Reese
Howard Davis, 23, of Concord. Davis was pronounced dead of multiple
gunshot wounds on arrival at Highland Hospital.
   Critically wounded was Wale U. Osijo, 33, whose hospital
location was being kept secret. Another guard in the office at the
time of the shooting was uninjured.
   An unidentified resident told reporters shots had been fired at
security guards before.

<HEAD>Crowd Prays For Nationalist Group In First Cathedral Service In 30
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Sunday allowed the first religious
service in 30 years in a Latvian cathedral converted into a concert
hall, and an overflow crowd prayed for a new nationalist group.
   The service was in the 13th Century Dom Cathedral, also known as
St. Peter's Cathedral, in Riga, the capital of the republic of
Latvia.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, and Ingrid Titavs, who
attended the service, said a Lutheran pastor devoted prayers to the
People's Front. The group, which demands that Latvians have more
say over their religious, economic and cultural affairs, ended its
founding congress Sunday.
   Ms. Titavs, a member of another group called the Latvian
National Independence Movement, said by telephone from Riga that
state-run television broke with its usual policy of promoting
atheism to carry the end of the service live.
   She said a long line of people waited to get inside the church
and a huge crowd stood outside during the service because there was
no more room for them inside. Police did not interfere, as they
have at other religious gatherings, she said.
   The cathedral, begun in 1211, is the largest in the Baltic Sea
republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The Soviet Union's
atheistic communist government had the building turned into a
concert hall about 30 years ago.
   Tass implied Sunday that the conversion was not done for
political reasons. It said the state took control of the cathedral
``because the small parish appeared to be unable to keep up this
architectural monument in due order.''
   The People's Front, which claims 130,000 members, ended a
two-day conference in Riga by adopting a charter, resolutions and
electing its leaders, Tass said.
   Neither Ms. Titavs nor Tass provided details of the measures.
The front has been pushing to make the republic economically
autonomous from Moscow.
   Ms. Titavs, who monitored broadcasts of Sunday's debate, said
the session was ``very stormy, very democratic and very open.''
   She said many speakers complained about the Latvian Communist
Party and government. The republic's president and Communist Party
chief were replaced last week.
   Speakers also condemned the Soviet takeover of the Baltic
republic in 1940, Ms. Titavs said. Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania
were absorbed by the Soviet Union under a pact signed with Nazi
Germany.
   ``Very many said we should have the right to be free,'' the
activist said.
   The People's Front is similar to organizations formed in
neighboring Estonia and Lithuania to make nationalist demands and
push Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program to reform the economy and
society.
   Tass said that among those attending the sessions in Riga were
the new president of the republic, Anatoly Gorbunov, who assumed
his post Thursday. His presence lent the group some official
backing.
   Jan Vagris, who took over as Latvia's Communist Party first
secretary on Tuesday, told Soviet television in an interview
broadcast Sunday night that he supports the People's Front because
it is firmly behind Gorbachev's reforms.
   In other nationalist activity, activists campaigning for the
independence of the republic of Georgia in the Caucasus Mountains
staged a four-hour sit-in Sunday.
   A witness, speaking by telephone from the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi, said several dozen people sat near the city's KGB
headquarters and carried the flag that flew in the republic before
it was made part of the Soviet Union.
   They also held signs demanding freedom of speech and protesting
police confiscation of an underground journal, said the witness,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Plainclothes KGB officers ripped away some of the signs, he
said. But the demonstrators dispersed voluntarily after authorities
promised to return the journal copies.

<TEXT>
   Senate Democratic candidate Brian Moss
says he did not intend to offend anyone when he said that
``polacks, spiks, wops and the Irish'' are welcome in the
Democratic Party.
   Moss made the comment after criticizing his opponent, Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, for an earlier statement that the Democrats are
``the party of homosexuals.''
   Almost immediately after his speech last week at the University
of Utah, Moss began receiving complaints from students, Hatch
campaign aides and others who found his offhand remark offensive.
   Moss is a Salt Lake City businessman, a former unsuccessful
candidate for Utah state treasurer and the son of former Sen. Frank
Moss, D-Utah, whom Hatch defeated in 1976.
   Moss said the Democratic Party was willing to listen to the
concerns of diverse groups such as homosexuals and other
minorities, even though it may not agree with them.
   ``We have been the party of the blacks, the browns, of the
Asian-Americans, of the young, of the old, of the poor. We're the
party of the of immigrants,'' he said.
   ``You may call us the party of the polacks, the party of spiks,
the party of wops, the party of the Irish ... any of those names,
because the Democratic Party has always had a tent large enough to
welcome all of those groups who are seeking their civil rights and
their concerns,'' he said.
   Moss said later he used those words to illustrate the
``harshness'' of Hatch's earlier ``inflammatory language.''
   ``It was rash. And for that I have apologized, will apologize
and will continue to apologize,'' Moss said.
   Hatch campaign manager Bud Scruggs accused Moss of ``focusing on
peripheral matters'' instead of dealing with the substance of
Hatch's point ``that the national Democratic leadership is beholden
to left-wing groups.''
   Scruggs said that ``for Brian Moss to try to turn that point
into a racial slur is kind of one more notch down in his level of
respectability in conducting the campaign.''

   A 26-year-old woman gave birth to sextuplets at a
Rome hospital, but one baby died Sunday and one was in guarded
condition, doctors said. The other four infants were reported doing
well.
   The four boys and two girls were born Saturday in Gemelli
Hospital to Lucia Soma, who was reported in good condition.
   Dr. Costantino Romagnoli said the 1-pound, 7-ounce boy who died
suffered from underdeveloped lungs and had been kept alive with a
respirator. He said another boy was in guarded condition.
   The babies, who were born prematurely after seven months, must
survive at least 96 hours before they are considered out of danger,
Romagnoli said.
   The mother, who had taken fertility drugs, had been pregnant
with seven babies, but one died in the womb four weeks ago,
according to Lorenzo Sommella, vice director of health services at
Gemelli Hospital.
   The father, Saverio Catapano, 31, said he is a worker who earns
a little more than $700 a month and that he and his wife share one
room in a house owned by his in-laws.

   The pick-up's gasoline tank ruptured and both vehicles burst
into flames, said investigators from the Kansas Highway Patrol. The
acccident happened at 10 p.m. Saturday on U.S. 69 in eastern Kansas.
   The only survivor in either vehicle was Mlle Brocaw, 18, of

<HEAD>Disney World Faces EPA Fines For Water Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney World theme park could
face thousands of dollars in fines for polluting a creek with its
sewage treatment, Environmental Protection Agency officials said.
   ``They've had violations ongoing for quite some time,'' said
Peter McGarry, who heads the EPA's water management compliance unit
for Florida. ``(Fines) certainly are a possibility.''
   For years, treated wastewater dumped by Disney into Reedy Creek
often has carried more phosphorus than allowed by EPA, and
sometimes there hasn't been enough oxygen, McGarry said. The creek
flows into Lake Russell about 10 miles south of Kissimmee.
   But since Disney started using a new artificial wetlands system
this summer to help clean its wastewater, levels of phosphorus and
nitrogen have doubled or tripled those allowed by EPA. ``That's the
worst problem,'' McGarry said.
   Disney's sewage plant now dumps an average of 5 million gallons
of treated effluent daily into Reedy Creek, said Tom Moses,
director of Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District.
   Moses said he plans to ask the Kissimmee City Commission for
help, The Orlando Sentinel reported Sunday.
   Kissimmee is allowed to dump into Reedy Creek more treated
wastewater and nutrients such as phosphorus than Disney, but the
city decided several years ago to build artificial ponds instead of
dumping into the creek.
   Moses wants Kissimmee to lend Disney the right to dump more
phosphorus and other nutrients into Reedy Creek for as long as four
years.
   Disney could use that time to build new treatment facilities,
improve oxygen levels in the water and see if its 130-acre
artificial wetlands will start working as expected, Moses said.
   Disney's problems with EPA come about six months after the state
accused the company of creating a ``major potential for harm'' to
human health and the environment.
   In March, the state found seven major violations involving
spilled or leaked hazardous waste. The Department of Environmental
Regulation later fined the company $150,299 _ the largest penalty
ever imposed by the agency's eight-county Central Florida district.
   Disney has since begun a cleanup effort.
   McGarry said EPA's decision on whether to impose fines might
depend on what Disney officials, after meeting with Kissimmee, say
they'll do to clean their wastewater.
   EPA administrative fines can't exceed $125,000. But EPA could
ask the Justice Department to seek fines of as much as $25,000 a
day, he said.
   If Kissimmee commissioners don't help Disney, Moses said, the
park could race to build new treatment facilities in a few months
to meet EPA limits.

<HEAD>Iraqis To Build New Presidential Palace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq will build a new presidential palace
to symbolize ``the heroic sacrifices of the Iraqi people'' in the
8-year-old war against Iran, the government-run Baghdad Observer
daily said Sunday.
   The new palace will replace the one built on the banks of the
Tigris River for Iraq's last monarch, King Faisal II, in 1956, two
years before he was killed in a coup.
   The English-language daily said the new structure will be built
on an elevated area of 430 square yards and will be surrounded by
green fields and orchards.
   The paper said several Iraqi and other Arab engineering
consultants have submitted designs for the new palace.
   The Baghdad Observer said President Saddam Hussein has ordered
that the design of his new palace be on historical Arab
architectural lines.
   ``It will tell the coming generations that Iraq has done a lot
to serve the Arab nation,'' the daily quoted Saddam as telling
engineers who participated in a design competition.
   The paper also said that Saddam ordered that some of the gold
donated by Iraqis for the war effort be used for ornamental
decorations on the new palace's main gate.
   Weapons used by Iraqi soldiers will be part of a steel monument
in the planned palace.
   The paper did not say how much the new palace will cost or when
construction would start.

<HEAD>Pentagon Asks To Probe Cases Of Missing, Dead Scientists:
Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States wants Britain to let Pentagon
specialists review the cases of several British defense workers who
have died under mysterious circumstances, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
   Citing an unidentified American source, the Sunday Times said
some of the workers were involved in British projects related to
``Star Wars,'' the space-based weapons defense system being
developed in the United States.
   ``It's irrefutable that they were working on projects applicable
to Star Wars,'' the source was quoted as saying.
   Though the newspaper said the U.S. Defense Department is
officially ``not commenting'' on the deaths, one spokesman was
quoted as saying the case had reached ``the point where we can't
ignore it anymore.''
   The Pentagon will also request its British counterpart, the
Ministry of Defense, to launch a comprehensive inquiry, the
newspaper said.
   ``Our position has been that there is no connection between
these deaths,'' a spokesman for the ministry was quoted as saying.
``But if the Americans ask for explanations, then that puts the
matter on a different plain.''
   Over the past six years, at least 16 British men employed in
defense-related fields have died or disappeared under unusual
circumstances.
   Seven worked for the Star Wars contractor Marconi Co. Ltd., a
subsidiary of Britain's General Electric Co. PLC, which recently
opened an internal inquiry into the case. The company is not
related to the American General Electric.
   The deaths began in March 1982. Keith Bowden, 45, an expert on
supercomputers and computer-controlled aircraft, died when his well
maintained car veered across a two-lane highway and down an
embankment.
   Since then, 15 more computer engineers, communications experts,
scientists and other workers related to the defense industry have
died or disappeared in a mysterious fashion.
   Ashaad Sharif, a computer systems analyst for a Marconi unit
near London, was found strangled in a park 105 miles west in
Bristol on Oct. 28, 1986. An inquest ruled he killed himself by
tying a rope to a tree, looping the other end around his neck and
then driving off at high speed.
   Five months later David Sands, 37, drove his car into a vacant
restaurant in Hampshire, in southern England. Gasoline tanks in the
trunk exploded, killing Sands, a computer expert who worked for
Easams, a Marconi sister company.
   Other dead men included employees of the Royal Military College
of Science, British Telecom's secret Martlesham Heath research site
and the Royal Air Force Research Center. Some died of drug
overdoses, in mysterious car crashes, or were found dead under
their cars with the engine running.
   One of the most recent deaths took place Aug. 23 when retired
Brig. Gen. John Ferry, 60, an assistant marketing director for
Marconi, apparently placed wires into his mouth and plugged the
leads into a wall.

<TEXT>
   Union members at the Electric Boat shipyard
plan to vote Tuesday on a tentative contract agreement that would
end a strike for more than 10,000 employees.
   Negotiators for the company and its workers reached the
agreement Saturday, the 100th day of a walkout by the submarine
builders.
   Electric Boat is the Navy's sole producer of the giant Trident
nuclear submarines and competes annually with the Newport News
(Va.) Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. for contracts to build the
smaller, SSN-688 fast attack subs.
   The company and the Metal Trades Council reached the tentative
settlement following four days of negotiations.
   ``We will unanimously endorse this agreement and recommend to
our membership that they ratify it,'' said MTC President Joseph W.
Messier.
   Messier and chief negotiator Thomas E. Kelly both refused to
discuss details of the contract.
   The company's last known four-year offer included a bonus worth
5 percent of a worker's annual pay in the first year; a 4 percent
bonus in the second year; a 3 percent general wage increase the
third year; and a $600 bonus in the fourth year. The proposal also
included a $1,000 contract ratification bonus.
   The MTC, which represents 10 local trades unions, struck July 1
when Electric Boat proposed a new contract that included only
bonuses and no raises over three years. Workers rejected the
proposal by a ratio of 5-3 on June 30.

<HEAD>Atlanta Looks to Processing `Operation Rescue' Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The so-called ``Siege of Atlanta'' anti-abortion
demonstrations are over but the city is still dealing with scores
of people clogging the jails and courts, many refusing to give
their names.
   One ``John Doe'' inmate jailed since July 19 escaped Saturday,
but police know his real name and where he lives.
   Last week's five days of protests outside four clinics ended
Saturday with the arrest of 40 demonstrators, bringing the week's
total to 461.
   About 140 of those still jailed have applied for release on bond
but have not been processed, said Tom Pocock, deputy director of
the Atlanta Corrections Bureau.
   Some applications were processed Sunday and by late afternoon
the number of protesters still jailed was down to 319, jail
officials said.
   Operation Rescue, the New York-based group that organized the
protests that began during the Democratic National Convention, has
accused the city of purposely delaying the releases to keep the
demonstrators in jail until the organizers leave.
   The city responds that Operation Rescue boasted that it would
clog the city's judicial process with hundreds of arrests and says
the demonstrators succeeded in doing just that.
   The city has refused to separate the paperwork of Operation
Rescue prisoners from that of the rest of the jail population,
further delaying processing.
   ``We have asked that Operation Rescue designate to us who should
be bonded out first based on family, job or health concerns,''
Pocock said Saturday.
   Many of those arrested identify themselves only as ``Baby Jane
Doe'' or ``Baby John Doe'' in solidarity with aborted fetuses and
cannot be freed on bond, the city says, because they could not be
found if they refused to appear.
   Baby John Doe No. 1, arrested at the first Operation Rescue
demonstration on July 19, escaped Saturday from a mimimum-security
jail annex. Pocock said the city lacked the resources or the
apparent need for better security and said the prisoner had assured
police he would be no trouble.
   He said police are seeking Joseph Roach, 50, of Broomall, Pa.,
and will charge him with escape. ``He exploited our benevolence,''
Pocock said.
   Since Operation Rescue came to Atlanta in July for the
Democratic National Convention, police have arrested more than
1,200 demonstrators.
   City officials said they had spent more than $500,000 on
security, arrests, jail and court costs for the protests before
last week's demonstrations. The police academy had to be closed and
recruits used to help control the demonstrators and keep the
clinics open.
   When last week's protests started Tuesday, police used
rougher-than-usual tactics, dragging demonstrators to buses if they
refused to walk. They eased up at midweek after several complaints.
   Operation Rescue has called for a nationwide demonstration Oct.
29.
   The aim of last week's demonstrations was to block clinic
entrances to prevent or dissuade women from entering to have
abortions, but many women entered the clinics anyway.
   Clinic operators said most appointments were kept, and some
patients entered before dawn to avoid the pickets.

<HEAD>Pope Condemns Anti-Semitism In Meeting With Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday condemned
anti-semitism as being ``opposed to the principles of
Christianity'' during a pilgrimage to northeastern France.
   John Paul made his statement to the Jewish community in this
historic city on the second day of a four-day visit to the region.
His journey to France is his 40th foreign trip since becoming pope
in 1978.
   The speech occurred at a time of tension in France over
anti-Semitism and racism. Ultra-conservative Catholics count
heavily among the followers of right-wing politician Jean-Marie Le
Pen, who campaigns on an anti-immigrant platform and has been
accused of making anti-Semitic remarks.
   Also Sunday, the pope saluted Moslems and called on Protestants
to be patient with efforts to unify the Roman Catholic church and
other Christian churches.
   John Paul took a cruise on the Rhine River to talk to
shipworkers, said Mass for the diocese of Strasbourg and helped
celebrate the city's 2000th anniversary, addressing thousands of
citizens in French and in their Alsatian dialect.
   The Jewish community of Strasbourg sent a letter to the Vatican
several months ago protesting continuing instances of Catholics
blaming the Jewish people for the killing of Christ and asked the
pope to recognize the state of Israel, said Jean Kahn, president of
the Strasbourg Jewish Community.
   In a meeting at the residence of Strasbourg's archbishop, the
pope told the Jewish representatives the two religions honored the
same God and had a common heritage and values.
   ``It is, therefore, in deep fidelity to the vocation to which
the God of peace and justice calls us _ and with us, all the
European peoples _ that I repeat once again with you the strongest
condemnation of all anti-semitism and of all racism, which are
opposed to the principles of Christianity and for which there
exists no justification in the cultures that would be tempted by
them,'' the Polish-born pope said.
   ``For the same reasons, we must discard any religious prejudice
that history has shown us as inspired by anti-Jewish stereotypes.''
   The pope spoke to about 30 men in skullcaps who listened
solemnly to his speech, then presented him with a book titled
``Jews in France'' and a painting of the Strasbourg synagogue built
to replace one destroyed by German soldiers who occupied the city
during World War II.
   The pope in turn presented the Jewish delegation with papal
medals.
   Some arch-conservative French Catholics, particularly those
inspired by breakaway Archishop Marcel Lefebvre, have rejected the
teachings of the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council that state the
Jewish people are not responsible for the death of Christ. Lefebvre
was excommunicated last summer for elevating several followers to
bishops in defiance of church authority.
   The Jewish community of Strasbourg, now with 15,000 members, was
subjected to massacres and expulsions in the 14th century and
persecution during World War II. Germans who occupied the city in
1940 destroyed the synagogue and 800 Jews were shot or deported.
   The pope praised the Jews' witness to their faith, which he said
``went as far as martyrdom, that survived the long shadows of
incomprehension, of the horrible abyss of the Shoah (Holocaust).''
   He did not discuss Israel. Vatican officials have cited Israel's
unsettled borders and the status of Jerusalem as obstacles to the
Catholic Church's recognition of the Jewish state. The Vatican also
says Palestinians are entitled to a homeland.
   Earlier, the 68-year-old pope heard a challenge from the leader
of Strasbourg's Protestant community, Michel Hoeffel, who said
churches were moving too slowly toward unity, causing ``true
suffering'' among the faithful, especially couples of mixed
marriage who wanted to receive the Eucharist together.
   Protestants make up 2 to 3 percent of the French population,
which is about 80 percent Catholic.
   Moslems are the second-largest religious group, numbering 2.8
million in this country of 55 million. Many of them immigrated from
former French colonies in North Africa.
   On Monday the pope was scheduled to visit the dioceses of Metz
and Nancy.

   Three Palestinians were shot to death as army
units hunted down agitators in 30 villages Sunday, while businesses
shut across the occupied territories in a strike marking 10 months
of rebellion against Israeli rule.
   Israeli troops shot and wounded at least 22 Palestinians in
clashes, Arab hospital officials said.
   The deaths raised to at least 294 the number of Palestinians
killed since the uprising was launched Dec. 8 against Israeli rule
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, seized from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East war. Six Israelis have died during the same
period.
   Most of the casualties Sunday were reported in West Bank
villages, where the raids were centered. Dozens of Palestinians
were arrested, witnesses said. They said troops removed rock and
barrel roadblocks and ordered anti-Israeli slogans washed from
village walls.
   A military official said the army sweep was ``part of our effort
to use different tactics'' to try to restore order in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israeli troops opened fire on a mob attacking them in the West
Bank village of Yatta when they entered to search and make arrests,
the official said. He said army helicopters evacuated the wounded
but two Palestinians died while receiving medical treatment.
   A third Palestinian was fatally shot in a skirmish with an
Israeli security guard, the army said.
   One of the dead, who was not identified by name, was wanted by
security forces for organizing protests, said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The official said no figures were available on the number of
arrests. He confirmed two Palestinians were wounded and said other
reports of injuries still were being checked. Military sources
confirmed eight wounded.
   In the Gaza Strip, an Israeli security guard was attacked by a
man with a knife when he tried to check the man's identification
aboard a bus entering the border town of Rafah from Egypt, an army
official said.
   The guard opened fire, killing the man and wounding another
passenger, the official said. He said the guard suffered minor head
wounds.
   An Arab reporter identified the dead man as 20-year-old Osama
Ahmed Abu Dahi, a university student from Rafah.
   The army later clamped a curfew on the town of 11,000 to prevent
any backlash.
   The strike, called by the PLO-backed Unified National Leadership
of the Uprising, closed shops and businesses throughout the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   On the eve of the strike, 10 torches were lighted on Ibal Mount
overlooking Nablus, the West Bank's largest city with 120,000
residents. The torches were to symbolize the completed months of
the ``intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising.
   Most of the casualties have occurred in clashes between
Palestinians and Israeli troops. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
said this weekend that more than 7,000 people have been injured in
the confrontations.
   In the last three days, more than 70 Palestinians have been
wounded in clashes in the occupied territories. Nine deaths have
been reported, including four Friday in stone-throwing melees in
Nablus.
   Seventeen of the injuries reported Sunday occurred in the West
Bank. Four were in the village of Kafr Nimeh, the site of a
day-long Israeli sweep, hospital officials said.
   In Gaza City, five Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds,
including a 13-year-old boy struck in the left hand, doctors at
Arab Ahli and Shifa hospitals reported.
   Clashes have intensified in recent weeks, and Israeli government
and military officials have accused the Palestinians of trying to
influence the upcoming Israeli elections and an expected meeting of
the Palestine Liberation Organization's parliament-in-exile.
   Security in the West Bank and Gaza has become a key issue in the
campaign leading to the Nov. 1 Israeli Parliament elections. The
PLO, meanwhile, is said to be split over what political moves to
make to enhance the uprising.

   Libya on Sunday said the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries should meet immediately to come up with a plan
to restore falling oil prices.
   The official Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in Rome, said
Libya called for an urgent meeting of the OPEC Ministerial Council
to ``take the necessary measures to stop the fall in prices,
restore stability to the oil market and to take prices up to levels
that are fair both to consumer and producer.''
   Oil prices tumbled last week to the lowest level since 1986.
Most analysts blame the sharp decline on the continued high amounts
of Saudi Arabian crude flowing into the market.
   The price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
fell Wednesday to $12.60.
   JANA said Libya's decision to call for the extraordinary meeting
was made ``after consultation with some (of the 13) OPEC member
countries.'' It did not elaborate.

   Rain was scattered across the eastern half of the nation Sunday,
and parts of the Northeast were touched by record low temperatures.
   Snow, occasionally mixed with rain, fell over northern Maine,
and changed to rain across the central section of the state by
noon. Two inches of snow fell on the top of Mount Washington, N.H.,
at over 6,000 feet, during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Light rain was scattered from western New York state across
northern Ohio, from southeastern Kansas into northwestern Arkansas,
and over central Louisiana into west-central Mississippi.
   Record lows were reported at Atlantic City, N.J., at 30 degrees;
Hartford, Conn., 28; Newark, N.J., 35; Syracuse, N.Y., 30;
Tallahassee, Fla., 38; and Wilmington, Del., 33. Records were tied
at Allentown, Pa., at 30; New York City, 37; Philadelphia, 35; and
Scranton, Pa., 31.
   But the official low in the 48 states was 16 at Gunnison, Colo.
   At the other extreme, Los Angeles hit a record 99 degrees at the
Civic Center.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 100 at Thermal, Calif.
   For Monday, scattered showers were forecast over the lower Great
Lakes and across Upper Michigan, with sunshine over much of the
rest of the nation.
   High only in the 40s were predicted in northern New England; in
the 50s and 60s from central New England into South Carolina, from
inland sections of the central Gulf of Mexico states across the
Tennessee Valley, the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes, the upper half
of the Mississippi Valley, the Missouri Valley and the northern
Plains; in the 60s over the southern Rockies and along the central
coast of California; in the 80s over much of Florida, across
southern Texas, much of the West between the Rockies and the Sierra
Nevada, and over much of the northern and southern Pacific Coast;
in the 90s to near 100 through the desert Southwest; and generally
in the 70s over the remainder of the nation.

<TEXT>
   A hostage recently freed by his
Moslem extremist kidnappers in Lebanon left Sunday for the United
States after medical checks and a debriefing at a U.S. military
hospital, an official said.
   ``Dr. Mithileshwar Singh left today for the United States,''
said Lt. Tom Gilroy, a press spokesman for the U.S. Air Force
Station in Wiesbaden.
   Gilroy said he was not allowed to reveal the flight schedule or
destination.
   Hospital officials last week said the India-born Singh, freed
Oct. 3, planned to travel to Colorado, but did not specify where.
Before he left for Beirut in 1983, Singh taught business economics
in Grand Junction, Colo., at the now-defunct Western Colorado
University.
   During Singh's stay at the air station's hospital, he said he
did not want to speak to reporters. On Thursday, a source close to
the debriefing team said Singh was worried about how his kidnappers
may react to his public statements.
   Singh, an Indian citizen with U.S. resident status, was
kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, in Beirut along with three American
citizens who are still in captivity. The three Americans have been
identified as Jesse Turner, 41; Alann Steen, 49; and Robert
Polhill, 54.
   Gilroy said he assumed Singh's Indian wife, Lalmani, was en
route with her husband to the United States. She arrived in
Frankfurt on Saturday from Beirut.
   In all 14 foreigners are still missing in Lebanon _ nine
Americans, three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian. The
longest-held is Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   The performers in the choir were children
who lost one or both parents in civil strife in Uganda. Some saw
their parents killed. Others wandered in the wilderness and went
hungry with no one to care for them.
   But as the African Children's Choir performed at Clinton Junior
High School Saturday, the singers showed none of the emotional
scars.
   ``If you came here to see a choir of long-faced, sad, orphan
children, you came to the wrong place,'' Gary Oliver, executive
director of the choir, told the audience of about 700.
   The choir is touring the nation to raise money to help build and
support orphanages and schools in Uganda.
   The children sang American spirituals such as ``Gospel Train''
and ``He's Got the Whole World in His Hands.'' They also performed
Christian songs in several African dialects.
   ``The Scriptures said, `A child shall lead them,''' the Rev.
Roger Tieken of Christ Lutheran Church said after the performance.
``These children led us all here today.''
   Many of the children lost their parents during the reign of Gen.
Idi Amin, who reportedly was responsible for jailing, torturing and
killing 500,000 Ugandans. Amin's regime, which began in 1971 when
he seized power from Prime Minister Milton Obote, was toppled in
1979, but reports of widespread violence and death were reported as
late as 1985.
   Despite the turmoil in their native country, the children said
they miss Uganda.
   ``I miss my mom and sisters,'' Richard Kaweesa, 12, said.
   ``I miss the people,'' said Florence Nalule.
   When the 26 children first came to America, about two-thirds did
not speak English, Oliver said. Today, they all speak English.
   ``It improves their employment opportunity in Uganda,'' Oliver
said.
   ``Home is home for them,'' Oliver said. ``They want to be with
their own people and eat their own food.''
   The children said they've enjoyed their stay in America and have
grown fond of pizza, Chinese food and hamburgers. But they said
don't like sandwiches, chocolate and unmelted cheese.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney General Blames Congress for Drug Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
blames Congress for problems in the battle against illegal drugs,
saying rhetoric is getting in the way of action.
   ``It's hard to remain patient when Congress seems to be waging
only a rhetorical war on drugs, denying year after year the
administration's requests for full funding for the necessary
resources to carry out our anti-drug efforts,'' Thornburgh said
Saturday.
   He told most of the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys gathered for a
meeting here that the war on drugs is one of the few areas where
Congress has shown budgetary restraint over the last seven years in
spite of a national consensus to do otherwise.
   Under fiscal 1989 appropriations, Congress has reduced U.S.
attorney positions by 10 percent, Thornburgh said. Legislators also
cut $321 million from President Reagan's request for new prisons,
providing for only two of seven proposed, he said.
   ``I will not be satisfied until we obtain full funding for our
efforts, until we put an end to the situation of a federal law
enforcement officer having to set aside a citizen's complaint,
saying, `Sorry, we don't have enough agents to check that out.' Or
of a U.S. attorney telling an agent, `Sorry, we don't have enough
prosecutors to bring that case to trial.' Or of a judge telling a
prosecutor that there is no room in a federal prison for a
convicted drug trafficker.''
   To that end, Thornburgh asked federal prosecutors to prepare
reports for him on the narcotics trafficking business in their
areas.
   ``Drag it out from under the rock where it lives and breeds so
that we can fully educate the American public as to the size and
breadth of these illegal and insidious business operations, so that
the public will better understand and more enthusiastically support
the difficult struggle in which we are engaged,'' he said.
   ``Furnish that information to me, and I promise you, that no one
will ever again accuse us of waging a phony war on drugs,''
Thornburgh pledged.

<TEXT>
   The Boardwalk is catching up with the
times, and it's keeping police busy giving speeding tickets to
electric rolling chair drivers racing tourists around over the 4
mph speed limit.
   Angry locals, who like the traditional hand-pushed wicker
versions better, say the newfangled gadgets aren't chairs, they're
carts, and they're causing a ``random riot'' on the old-fashioned
walkway by the sea.
   Merchants say the electric transports endanger pedestrians and
whiz customers right past their doors.
   But tourists, who find them a quick and inexpensive way to get
from one end of the Boardwalk casino strip to the other, are paying
fares that add up to as $4,000 a day. And Atlantic City's two
traditional rolling chair companies have been all but pushed out of
business since the upstarts arrived over the Labor Day weekend.
   ``It has hurt us bad,'' said Larry Belfer, owner of Atlantic
City Famous Rolling Chairs, the traditional three-wheeled wicker
contraptions made famous on the Boardwalk. ``Although these
electric carts are a great source of transportation, there are
other people and livelihoods concerned.''
   The saga began in July when Ernest English and Stuart McGinnis,
partners in the King La Corbliere Electric Rolling Chair Co.,
purchased all 100 of the mercantile licenses under an ordinance
that regulated motorized rolling chairs that had been used in the
1950s. The permits were granted before city officials found out
what type of vehicle the partners had in mind.
   ``They're golf carts. They're not rolling chairs,'' said city
Councilman Arnold Orsatti Jr.
   City officials wanted to revoke the permits immediately, but
decided that arguing over the ordinance's vague definition of a
rolling chair was a losing proposition. The traditional chairs
resemble a three-sided wicker basket that rolls on a small wheel in
front and two larger ones in back.
   King La Corbliere puts 60 carts on the boards every weekday and
100 on the weekends. The fare is $1, $2 or $3, depending on the
length of the trip.
   A ride in a traditional chair costs $5 to $7 and takes twice as
long.
   Drivers lease the carts from King in three-hour shifts.
   ``You can do $300 a day, easy,'' said English, who formerly
pushed the antique wicker chairs.
   The electric carts make no noise and carry no horns, and English
said the drivers are not permitted to blow whistles.
   ``I don't think they're safe,'' Orsatti said. ``The Boardwalk is
mainly a pedestrian thoroughfare.''
   Merchants have complained to police and City Hall, saying a
number of carts have narrowly missed pedestrians.
   ``It's a random riot running all over the Boardwalk
everywhere,'' said Frank Glaser, president of the Boardwalk
Merchants Association.
   English said he will fight in court if city officials try to
revoke his licenses. Orsatti said he expected a court battle.

   Colossus and Muke have stopped
fighting, but they haven't started much else, zoo keepers said
Sunday on the third day of a breeding project for the two oversized
gorillas.
   ``They pretty much just sit on opposite sides of the yard,''
said Lori Layfield of The Zoo in this Panhandle city. ``They
haven't had much contact.''
   But she said keepers were pleased that there's been no repeat of
a first-day fight and that there were signs Colossus, a 600-pound
male on his first date, and Muke, a 250-pound female, are at least
interested in each other.
   ``He peeps at her and she peeps at him. If she moves out of his
sight, he'll move around until he can see her, and she does the
same,'' Ms. Layfield said.
   Overall, keepers who didn't know what to expect are ``thrilled''
by the gorillas' first weekend together, she said.
   Colossus, who has been in the zoo since March, and Muke,
(pronounced moo-key) there since June, got their first look at each
other Friday.
   Colossus, the largest gorilla in U.S. captivity, charged and
flipped literally head over heels in an apparent attempt to injure
Muke. He came away with a mouthful of fur and a 5-inch gash in his
neck delivered by Muke.
   ``That was a good introduction,'' said Pat Quinn, the zoo's
president and director. ``It was the first time he has touched
another gorilla since he was an infant over 20 years ago.''
   Both gorillas are age 22. Colossus stands at 6 feet, 2 inches.
Muke is believed to be one of the larger female gorillas in
captivity.
   Officials hope the breeding project, which will last
indefinitely, will shed new light on how gorillas mate in
captivity. Colossus' genes could be important because he is not
related to any other zoo gorillas, Quinn said.
   The two gorillas live in a new complex that includes air
conditioning, sleeping quarters, an observation area and the play
yard. They are herded into separate sleeping quarters, then back
into the common yard during the day.
   Colossus was captured as an infant in the western lowlands of
Central Africa in 1967. He came to Florida from Benson's Animal
Park in Hudson, N.H. Muke is on loan from the St. Louis Zoo.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers fired into crowds of
demonstrators Sunday who refused to disperse, and police and
hospital sources said at least 200 people have died in rioting over
rising prices and a government austerity program.
   Clashes between the army and demonstrators grew more violent
late Saturday and early Sunday. Soldiers were ordered to shoot at
protesters who did not disperse and fired repeatedly.
   The government without elaborating confirmed deaths among
security forces, with the worst violence reported in southern and
eastern Algiers and the western port of Oran. Fighting also was
reported in 12 provincial centers.
   The official APS Algerian news agency gave a list of reasons for
the mounting unrest _ crop failure, the collapse of oil prices, the
global economic crisis and Algeria's enormous population increase _
from 9.4 million in 1954 to more than 23 million.
   The unrest began about 10 days ago, when industrial workers
staged strikes for higher wages. The government said it would not
break with its austerity plan to raise wages, and youths began
rampaging in Algiers and other cities.
   The austerity plan is aimed at resolving an economic crisis made
worse by the fall in the price of oil, the nation's main source of
revenue. The plan, announced in January, increased most food prices
and cut surplus workers in the state-owned industries that dominate
the economy.
   The annual unemployment rate is estimated at 40 percent, and
food prices have risen by at least 40 percent since January.
   Sunday in the capital, Algiers, army helicopters armed with
rockets flew low, apparently to discourage crowds from forming.
   The city was mostly calm. After midday prayers at the city's
mosques, some people gathered and chanted, ``Chadli Must Go!'' in
reference to President Chadli Bendjedid. They dispersed quickly
when soldiers charged.
   Bendjedid planned to address the North African nation Monday
evening, according to the official news agency. It would be the
first statement by Bendjedid, who also is chief of the armed
forces, since riots flared in Algiers last Tuesday night.
   Hospital and police sources in various parts of the country said
at least 200 people had been killed and several hundred injured the
past five days. The government has given no official death toll.
   From the accounts of sources, and citizens who witnessed
clashes, it seemed likely the death toll had far exceeded 200.
   Abderrahmane Bonato, a 30-year-old teacher, said he was
returning home before the 10 p.m. curfew Saturday when he saw
several soldiers firing on ``perfectly quiet and respectful''
crowds.
   ``I saw two men who were wounded being dragged into a passageway
by their comrades,'' Bonato said. ``I don't know what happened to
them.''
   A government official, Aliouane Fadela, said she saw gendarmes
in riot gear ``charging bystanders who were doing nothing, and then
kick them once they were on the ground.'' The gendarmes are police
under military control.
   Authorities on Thursday imposed a state of emergency with
overnight curfews and reported the arrest of more than 900 people
for looting.
   A shadowy Islamic fundamentalist group calling itself the
Movement for Algerian Renewal on Sunday demanded removal of the
president; the head of the ruling National Liberation Front Party;
and the Interior Minister.
   The group on Saturday demanded cheaper food and dismissal of the
government and Parliament to spare a new wave of violence.
   While the group claimed to lead the violence, many other groups
appear to be involved.
   Algerian radio reported Sunday that crowds of young people
confronted tanks in the Kabyle mountain region east of Algiers _
where about 2 million Berbers claim they are discriminated against
for their non-Arabic language _ as well as in towns in the southern
desert. The radio did not report casualties.
   The most casualties were reported in the town of Kouba, on the
southern fringes of Algiers, where the army fired into a crowd that
ignored calls to disperse. Hospital sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said at least 60 people were killed.
   Witnesses said soldiers fired with machine guns mounted on tanks
and jeeps.
   In Bachdjarah, in the eastern suburbs of Algiers, 30 people were
reported killed, and in the western district of Bab-el-Oued, nine
protesters reportedly died.
   Hundreds of demonstrators were injured in the Algiers area,
hospital officials said. At the city's Mustapha Hospital,
physicians said patients had to be moved out of some wards to make
room for the injured.
   Outside Algiers, the most serious incidents were reported in
Oran, where about 20 people were reported killed, and in Annaba, an
eastern industrial city where at least eight people died.
   Witnesses said the army fired directly into a crowd in Ain
Benyane, a seaside resort just east of Algiers, killing about 10
people and injuring at least as many.

   Testimony by Solidarity spokesman Janusz
Onyskiewicz before a U.S. Congressional hearing has harmed Poland,
the foreign ministry said Sunday.
   The state news agency PAP said the foreign ministry has turned
over materials concerning last month's testimony to the prosecutor
general for legal review.
   ``There is no doubt, however, that from the political and moral
point of view the attitude of Janusz Onyskiewicz ... did some harm
to Poland abroad,'' the news agency said in a statement.
   Onyskiewicz, a mathematics instructor at Warsaw University who
has been Solidarity's spokesman since 1981, returned to Poland a
week ago after a trip to the United States. While in Washington, he
met President Reagan and appeared before a congressional hearing.
   During the visit, Onyskiewicz urged continued American pressure
on Poland to bring about legal recognition of Solidarity, the
Soviet bloc's first independent trade union, which was suppressed
by the martial law crackdown in 1981 and banned the next year.
   Onyskiewicz and Jan Nowak, director of the Polish-American
Congress, an organization of Americans of Polish descent, testified
before a congressional committee about human rights in Poland and
treatment of Poles elsewhere, including the Soviet Union.
   Sunday's statement said Onyskiewicz's testimony was
``unprecedented'' and marked the first time a Polish citizen
permanently residing in Poland had testified before a U.S.
Congressional hearing.
   Polish officials have often criticized U.S. aid given to
Solidarity over the last several years, saying it in effect makes
the banned union an agent of a foreign power.

   More than 3,000 people left their homes
Sunday while a hazardous waste crew blew up a corroded tank
believed to hold up to 30 pounds of deadly hydrogen cyanide.
   The explosion occurred at 1:55 p.m. and a fire was started to
burn off the tank's contents. Environmental Protection Agency
spokesman Harold Yates said that at 2:01 p.m. ``no air readings
indicated any hydrogen cyanide down wind.''
   As little as 50 milligrams of the hydrogen cyanide, or less than
one-sixth the weight of the average aspirin tablet, can kill.
   ``There was no reason to think it was anything other than
hydrogen cyanide,'' said Jerry Heston, the EPA's on-site
coordinator. A monitor held directly over the burning cylinder
indicated 1 part per million of the poison, but Heston said the
smoke and burning sandbags may have given a false reading.
   EPA officials had not been certain of the tank's contents, so
analysts will examine a videotape of the explosion to look for a
telltale purplish corona, which indicates the presence of hydrogen
cyanide, surrounding the main body of the flame, Yates said.
   The 4-foot-long cylinder was abandoned at the site of the
defunct Artel Chemical Co. plant, now a federal Superfund cleanup
site, with 3,400 other drums and barrels of hazardous materials,
many of them unidentified and most of them rusting.
   Yates said the hydrogen cyanide burn-off was the most disruptive
effect so far of a cleanup that began in June. But he said
residents can count on more evacuations when EPA officials deal
with 9,000 gallons of methyl mercaptan, which is toxic and highly
flammable, and a bunker full of sodium, which reacts violently on
contact with water.
   Ambulances arrived shortly after dawn to begin taking the
elderly and handicapped to evacuation centers, but city buses from
nearby Charleston that rolled through the town were relatively
empty as most people chose to go to relatives' homes and local
shopping malls.
   ``This is going to be the best thing that's happened for the
Charleston Town Center and the Huntington Mall. These people are
going shopping,'' Nitro Mayor Don Karnes said.
   Traffic steadily increased throughout the morning on West
Virginia 25, the main north-south route through town, but abruptly
stopped at 12:30 p.m. when state police, city police and Kanawha
and Putnam County deputies sealed off part of the town.
   After the area within 1,000 yards of the plant was evacuated,
three men who work for a disposal company hired by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency carried the cylinder 100 feet to a
bunker.
   There, the aging metal tank was ripped open by explosives and
its contents consumed in a gasoline-and-diesel oil fire before
fumes could drift away.
   Orange wind socks pointed northeastward toward the more heavily
industrialized area of Nitro. The wind was estimated at 10 to 15
mph.
   There was a possibility that the aging chemical in the tank was
unstable, so while the disposal crew carried the cylinder, one
member kept a hand on it to feel for heat that would indicate a
chemical reaction. Any reaction could have increased pressure
inside the more-than-20-year-old tank and caused a premature blast.
   Yates said the cylinder never heated up.
   The dirt and sandbag bunker, 12 feet high with a 12-foot by
12-foot base, had a metal lid to stop any shrapnel.
   The tank was considered one of the most dangerous at the site
because of its age and because no one was quite sure what it
contained. It was labeled as hydrogen cyanide, a basic compound
used in several industrial chemical processes, but in the plant's
35-year history there was a chance other materials may have been
stored in it.
   Elmer Fike, who ran the plant as Fike Chemical Co. for 33 years,
was sure the tank held hydrogen cyanide, one of the most poisonous
substances known.
   The federal government built Nitro in World War I for the
manufacture of explosives and munitions. Now the Kanawha River
Valley through the Charleston area is studded with chemical plants.

   About 40,000 music fans showed up in this
Mississippi River town for the third annual King Biscuit Blues
Festival.
   ``A lot of people thought the blues were dead, but anyone who
was in town this weekend sure wouldn't believe that,'' said Bubba
Sullivan, owner of Blues Corner Records.
   And the maps in Sullivan's record store prove it.
   Sullivan asked customers to mark their hometowns on the United
States map with pins. By Saturday afternoon, the map was covered
with pins from Seattle to San Diego and from Connecticut to Florida.
   A world map next to it had pins in Germany, Japan, Austria and
New Zealand.
   The festival, which featured performances on a stage in front of
an old railroad station, started Friday night with J.E. Morgan, Mud
Boy and the Neutrons, C.W. Gatlin, and Levon Helm.
   On Saturday, the lineup included Lonnie Shields, the Jelly Roll
Kings, Sunnyland Slim and Kansas City Red. Also on tap were James
Cotton and a tribute to Muddy Waters featuring Pinetop Perkins,
Jimmy Rogers, Mojo Buford and the Legendary Blues Band.
   The festival was named after ``King Biscuit Time,'' a half-hour
blues program on a local radio station since 1941.

   The director of Loma Linda
University's infant heart transplant program was joined Sunday by
two distraught sets of parents who pleaded for heart donors to save
their children.
   Daymon and Cynthia Petersen of Salt Lake City, Utah, joined
David and Susan Jirschefske of Pasadena, Calif., to ask parents of
infants who have died to consider donating the baby's organs.
   ``I just hope to God they can look through the pain,'' said
Daymon Petersen, whose unborn son has been diagnosed with
hypoplastic left-heart syndrome, a terminal underdevelopment of the
heart's left ventricle. The child is expected to be born in about
two weeks.
   ``Once he's born the time clock starts,'' Petersen said. ``And
you don't know when that clock will stop.''
   The Jirschefske's 1-week-old son Daniel also has been diagnosed
with the disease.
   ``People need to know that there is a desperate need for organs,
from the first day of life to adulthood,'' said Dr. Leonard Bailey,
head of Loma Linda University Medical Center's infant heart
transplant program.
   ``Any time there's a brain-dead baby _ which in itself is an
utterly hopeless tragedy _ that tragedy can be transformed into
life for as many as three or four other babies and children,''
Bailey said.
   Bailey in 1984 performed the controversial transplant of a
baboon heart to the infant known as Baby Fae, who died 20 days
after the surgery.

<TEXT>
   Israel began a nationwide campaign Sunday to
vaccinate three-quarters of its population against polio after the
infectious virus was found in sewage in 27 areas. Panic was
reported at some vaccination centers.
   The Health Ministry ordered the campaign to vaccinate 3.2
million people after 10 Israelis were affected by the disease that
causes muscular paralysis, spokesman Shmuel Algrabli said.
   Last Friday, vaccinations began in a few areas where the virus
was found in sewage. The expanded national campaign was decided on
after the virus subsequently was discovered in other areas.
   Since September, polio has spread from central Israel to
Jerusalem, the port city of Haifa, and was found in sewage in at
least 12 cities from northern Tiberias to Deir el Balah in the
occupied Gaza Strip in the south.
   But Algrabli denied there was a polio epidemic. ``Experts say
it's only a local event. The situation has not changed for the
worse. We haven't had a single polio case since Sept. 12, and those
10 were mostly in one area.''
   About 3.2 million people under the age 40 are to be vaccinated
the next four weeks at the cost of at least $2.5 million. Those
over 40 are not included under the theory they would likely have
been innoculated during the polio scare in the 1940s and '50s.
   Sunday, the ministry began vaccinating infants of up to 2 months
old but in many areas, older children were also vaccinated.
   Algrabli said about 350,000 people were vaccinated Sunday.
   In many clinics, shortages were reported. In Yehud near Tel
Aviv, where the virus was found, a woman told Israel radio:
   ``I have been in the clinic since 8 a.m. We check every hour,
and they still have no vaccines.''
   At a mother-and-child care center in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda
market, nurses said they ran out of vaccines in the morning but
later received some supplies.
   Mothers stood in line with their children. One woman brought her
yet unnamed week-old niece straight from the hospital where she was
born.
   At some clinics panic was reported.
   Linda Cahill, who immunized her two children at the Misgav Ladah
Hospital in Jerusalem, said many adults crowded around nurses,
asking to be vaccinated. Some burst into tears when they learned
they could not be vaccinated with their children.
   The polio virus caught Israel unprepared. Israelis are immunized
as children and the current vaccination is viewed as an additional
booster. There were no polio cases in 1986 and only one case in
1987. Recent cases were blamed on overflowing sewage.
   ``Sewage is a time-bomb that can explode every moment,'' Health
Minister Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino told Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir at a Cabinet meeting Sunday, according to Israel radio.
   Meanwhile, polio became an issue in Israel's elections campaign
as Amnon Rubinstein, head of the centrist Shinui movement, demanded
Arbeli-Almozlino resign. The health minister is running for
Parliament on the ticket of the left-leaning Labor Party.
   ``Why resign? Did I bring polio to Israel?'' Arbeli-Almozlino
was quoted as saying in the daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
   The Tourism Ministry expressed concern that reports about the
disease would keep tourists from Israel. Tourism already has
dropped dramatically since the Palestinian uprising broke out in
the occupied territories 10 months ago.
   ``There is no problem with visiting Israel. We welcome every
tourist. Those wishing to be vaccinated can do so at the same time
Israeli adults are called in,'' Algrabli said.

<HEAD>Meeting Fails to Focus Black Support on One Mayoral Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attempt to have Chicago's black community
unite behind one mayoral candidate yielded no clear winner as
delegates to a meeting showed strong support for two contenders.
   ``We are about to commit political fratricide and not have any
political power in this town anymore,'' said attorney Lewis Myer
Jr., who was the keynote speaker for Saturday's meeting.
   Aldermen Danny Davis, who has announced he is running for mayor,
and Timothy Evans, who is expected to enter the race, split the
vote of most of the 53 delegates from black organizations. Davis
garnered 24 votes, Evans got 23 and Mayor Eugene Sawyer got 6 votes.
   ``Unless we have unity we might as well hang it up today,'' said
the Rev. Willie Barrow, leader of Chicago's Operation PUSH.
   Chicago's election to replace the late Mayor Harold Washington,
who died last year, will either be next spring or in 1991. The date
is the subject of a lawsuit.
   An additional 118 black groups that were invited to take part in
the meeting either abstained or did not send representatives. No
current or anticipated mayoral candidates attended.
   The vote came at the second meeting designed to unify the black
community behind a single black candidate. The first gathering, at
which Davis spoke, was Aug. 27.
   Evans and Sawyer did not attend the first meeting, saying the
gathering was not representative of the entire city.

<TEXT>
   Sir Egerton Richardson, Jamaica's first
permanent representative to the United Nations and former
ambassador to the United States, has died at his home, authorities
said Sunday. He was 76 years old.
   The cause of his death Saturday night was not immediately known,
but Richardson had been ill for more than a year, weekend news
editor Wyvonyn Gager of the Daily Gleaner newspaper said.
   Richardson was born Aug. 12, 1912, and entered the civil service
in 1933. He was named Jamaica's first representative to the United
Nations in 1962, shortly after the island gained independence from
Great Britain, and occupied the post until 1967, when he was named
ambassador to the United States.
   Richardson remained ambassador in Washington until 1972.
   The diplomat attended Calabar High School in Kingston and
graduated from Oxford University in England.
   ``I had the pleasure of working with him for a number of years
and admired his competence,'' former Prime Minister Michael Manley
told the Kingston newspaper. ``He also had the unique ability of
being able to analyze the most complex of problems and present his
advice simply and concisely.''
   Richardson is survived by his wife, Ivonne, a son and a
daughter, whose names were not immediately known.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Rescuers called off their search Sunday for
three people missing and believed drowned in the Atlantic Ocean,
including a father and daughter swept into heavy surf as two other
family members watched.
   ``You can't give up hope, but the most we can probably hope for
is is to try to find (the bodies) for their families,'' said police
Sgt. Gary Finley.
   Terry Hundley, 41, of Durham, N.H., and his 11-year-old daughter
Marisol were swept into the ocean, with his wife and son watching,
after the family walked to the rocky shore near Bald Head Cliff to
watch 15-foot waves break Sunday morning, Finley said.
   A young boy was lost in the sea about a mile away in Ogunquit,
authorities said. Officials did not know the child's identity,
Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Gary Salamacha said.
   Air and sea searches were futile, Coast Guard officials and
police said. Searches will resume Monday morning, Finley said.

<HEAD>Fellow Olympian Says She And Johnson Took Steroids</HEAD>
<HEAD>A version of this story moved on sports wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ben Johnson knowingly took steroids and those
close close to the runner also were aware of it, fellow Canadian
Olympic sprinter Angella Issajenko was quoted as saying in an
interview published Sunday.
   Johnson _ stripped of his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter
final after he tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol _
also was taking steroids when he set a world sprint record last
summer in Rome, the Toronto Star newspaper quoted Ms. Issajenko as
saying.
   Ms. Issajenko, who also competed in the Olympics in Seoul, South
Korea, was quoted as saying she also took the muscle-building drug.
The Olympics, which began Sept. 17, ended Oct. 2.
   Later, her husband Tony said Ms. Issajenko denied saying she and
Johnson took steroids. The Toronto Star said Sunday that it stood
by its story.
   Ms. Issajenko previously accused a therapist of giving her and
Johnson steroids without their knowledge but later retracted the
statement.
   Ms. Issajenko in the interview claimed Dr. George Mario (Jamie)
Astaphan provided steroids and monitored the program with the
knowledge of Charlie Francis, coach of the Mazda Optimist Track
Club, which she and Johnson belong to.
   ``I just don't care any more,'' Ms. Issajenko was quoted as
saying. ``I'm fed up with all the bull. ... Ben takes steroids. I
take steroids. Jamie (Astaphan) gives them to us and Charlie isn't
a scientist but he knows what's happening.''
   Johnson, 26, says he has never knowingly taken illegal drugs
while Astaphan has said he has never administered stanozolol _ the
banned steroid found in the runner's urine sample after his world
record 100-meter run at the Olympics.
   Francis, meanwhile, has said the test result ``defies all
logic'' and could only be explained ``by deliberate manipulation of
the testing process.''
   Ms. Issajenko, 30, was quoted as saying she had first-hand
knowledge Johnson received steroids from Astaphan from 1984 to 1986
but ``Ben was going on his own to Jamie after that.''
   She also said Astaphan was administering steroids to Johnson
when he set a 9.83-second world record in the 100-metre sprint at
the world championships in Rome. Johnson's Seoul run lowered that
mark to 9.79 seconds.
   Ms. Issajenko, the Canadian 100- and 200-metre champion, said
she has been threatened since she has come forward with her
accusations against the Jamaican-born Johnson.
   After Johnson tested positive for steroids at the Olympics, Ms.
Issajenko said therapist Waldemar Matuszewski had ``tampered'' with
her and Johnson. Ms. Issajenko claimed the therapist had put
anabolic steroids in the rubbing compound he used to massage their
muscles.
   The story was called ``nonsense'' by Canadian Olympic track
physician Dr. Robert Luba and Issajenko later retracted her charges
against Matuszewski.
   The federal government has appointed Ontario Associate Chief
Justice Charles Dubin to head a judicial inquiry into the Ben
Johnson affair.
   Astaphan and Francis could not be immediately reached for
comment.

<HEAD>Bush Vows Never to Forget Lack of Freedom in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS graf 16 to UPDATE with Dukakis spokesman saying debate
on Thursday unless rainouts extend National League series.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CICERO, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, campaigning in a
state crucial to his and Democratic rival Michael Dukakis's
election hopes, marched in a Slavic parade Sunday and declared that
``none of us will ever forget there is not freedom in Eastern
Europe.''
   The vice president and his wife, Barbara, rode in an
old-fashioned fire truck under cloudy skies and waved at thousands
of people along the two-mile parade route in this western Chicago
suburb.
   Bush participated in the city's annual Houby Day parade, a
Czechoslovakian celebration of bountiful mushroom crops. Houby is a
Czech word for mushroom.
   ``This is the day we celebrate family, we celebrate faith and we
celebrate freedom,'' the GOP nominee said in brief remarks before
the parade began. ``And none of us will ever forget there is not
freedom in Eastern Europe, and I have pledged, as president, to
never forget that.''
   Bush's declaration was a reversal of former President Ford's
celebrated misstatement during his October 1976 debate with Jimmy
Carter, when Ford declared there was ``no Soviet domination of
Eastern Europe.'' That remark is widely believed to have
contributed to the Republican president's election defeat that year.
   Although those carrying pro-Bush signs were clearly in the
majority Sunday, a group of demonstrators, some carrying Dukakis
banners, marched alongside the vice president chanting the
Democratic refrain, ``Where Was George?''
   Bush pointed to himself as if to say, ``here I am,'' and called
out, ``Where is Mike?''
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said the campaign views
Cicero as ``a community where there are a lot of swing voters.''
   Both candidates are focusing attention on Illinois and its 24
electoral votes. Recent polls show a near dead heat between Bush
and Dukakis in the state.
   Dukakis campaigned here last week. The vice president has been
in Illinois five times since he was nominated by the GOP National
Convention in mid-August.
   ``My guess is it's dead even at best (in Illinois),'' Fuller
told reporters.
   The congressional district that includes Cicero is largely
Democratic, but President Reagan carried it by 58 percent of the
vote in 1984.
   In Chicago, state union leaders challenged Bush to ``stop the
parade of Illinois jobs to foreign markets instead of throwing
waves to parades.''
   Carl Alessi, legislative director of the Chicago Federation of
Labor, issued a statement challenging Bush to explain to Illinois
workers why they lost well-paying manufacturing jobs in the 1982
recession and ``why they should be satisfied with a hole in a Swiss
cheese economy instead of foreign markets to sell the products they
have the skills to produce.''
   Bush was the only one of the national candidates who campaigned
Sunday. Aides said he spent several hours at his Washington home
Sunday morning preparing for the second nationally televised debate
with Dukakis in Los Angeles.
   The debate will begin at 9 p.m. EDT in the Pauley Pavilion on
the campus of the University of California at Los Angeles. The date
will be Thursday unless rainouts extend the National League
baseball series, Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said Sunday.
   Dukakis spent much of Sunday closeted with a dozen aides at the
Park Plaza Hotel in Boston discussing debate strategy. He flies to
New York on Monday to meet with students at a Levittown high school
on Long Island and to march in the Columbus Day parade in Manhattan
with Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Bush planned a light week of campaigning, with a morning-only
event planned in Trenton, N.J., on Monday. He will fly to Los
Angeles on Tuesday and remain in California until after the debate,
aides said.
   Bush's running mate, Dan Quayle, embarks Monday on a six-day,
cross-country tour that will take him to Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,
South Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico
and Wisconsin.
   Quayle has told reporters he doesn't believe he is a liability
to the Bush campaign, despite his poor showing in public opinion
polls after his debate last week with Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen.
   But Kevin Phillips, a conservative Republican political analyst,
said in NBC's ``Meet the Press'' show that voters, including many
Republicans, are ``nervous'' about Quayle.
   Democratic pollster Peter Hart said on the same program that a
comparison of public and private polls before and after the
Quayle-Bentsen debate showed a shift of 2 or 3 percentage points in
favor of the Democratic ticket.
   Bentsen, returning to Washington after three days of post-debate
campaigning in Texas and New Mexico, said Sunday he thought there
was still time for the Democratic ticket to overcome the
Republicans.
   ``It's soft on both sides,'' he told reporters, referring to
some national polls showing Dukakis trailing Bush.
   The Texas senator expressed relief that the Dukakis campaign
finally is going on the air with tough political ads to counter
Republican attacks. ``Where have they been?'' Bentsen asked.
   Bentsen said the Democrats should have responded immediately
when the Republicans first began what he called distortions of
Dukakis' record and attacks on his patriotism during the summer.

<HEAD>Pinochet Again Rules Out Opposition Demands For Him To Step Down</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout with Pinochet again rejecting opposition
requests he leave office early, shooting incident near U.S.
consulate. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Gen. Augusto Pinochet late
Sunday again rejected opposition demands that he step down from
power, saying he will not leave office before March 1990.
   ``The situation is very simple,'' Pinochet said in a surprise
television appearance from his country home at Bucalemu. ``We
fulfilled the constitution that was set up ... so, now that the
opposition has triumphed, why should we change?''
   ``I acknowlege the opposition's victory, but I am not going to
change what the constitution says,'' Pinochet said. ``March 11,
1990, is going to be the day that the government is handed over.''
   The comments of the 72-year-old commander-in-chief of Chile's
armed forces came during a three-minute TV newscast. Pinochet was
dressed in a short-sleeve blue shirt. He appeared relaxed and spoke
clearly and firmly.
   Last Wednesday, nearly 7 million Chileans went to the polls to
vote on the armed forces' proposal that Pinochet legally be allowed
to remain president until 1997.
   Pinochet, who ousted elected Marxist President Salvador Allende
in a 1973 coup, lost by about 800,000 votes. Precedence for the
balloting was established under the 1980 constitution.
   In that constitution, elections for president and congress won't
be held until December 1989, with the winners taking office the
following March.
   Opposition leaders, including Patricio Aylwin, spokesman for the
16-party coalition that urged Chileans to vote ``no'' in the
referendum, have pressed the military government to move up the
date of elections, among other constitutional changes.
   ``We will formally call on those holding power now, to talk to
reach an agreement,'' Aylwin said in an interview published Sunday
in the newspaper La Epoca. ``We will take the initiative by making
a proposal and call to the armed forces.''
   A 4-man military junta acts as the legislature of this South
America country, which has been ruled by freely elected, democratic
governments for most of its 178-year history as an independent
nation.
   The junta is empowered to change the constitution, but Pinochet
emphasized in aspeech broadcast nationwide the night after the
referendum that he had no intention of doing so.
   Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez, the head of Pinochet's
16-member cabinet and director of his losing referendum campaign,
urged Pinochet supporters to remain ``united and mobilized around
our president.'' He did not address opposition demands for changes.
   Opposition proposals include: move up the date of national
elections, eliminate a constitutional ban on Marxist groups, and
allow the entire senate _ not just two-thirds _ to be elected, not
appointed.
   Also, opposition leaders want to streamline the process by which
future constitutional changes can be made.
   Ricardo Lagos, a prominent, moderate Socialist, acknowleged that
negotiations, if they take place, would take time. ``The people are
mature enough to understand that 15 years of dictatorship don't end
in 15 hours.''
   But other Pinochet opponents already have served notice they
don't intend to wait peacefully, or long. On Saturday, a coalition
of leftist parties publicly called for Pinochet's immediate
resignation.
   The situation sets up potential clashes between the government
and its opponents. In the two days following the election, tens of
thousands of Chileans celebrated Pinochet's defeat with spontaneous
demonstrations in the streets of the capital and oother major
cities.
   Last Friday, an estimated 350,000 Chileans gathered in a
downtown park in a rally organized by the opposition political
coalition.
   Also, hundreds of youths clashed with riot police, leading to
dozens of injuries and arrests, and two shooting deaths.
   Journalists were among those attacked by riot police last week,
resulting in minor injuries to about 20 reporters and photographers.
   In a separate development Sunday, two national policemen
guarding the U.S. Consulate told the state Orbe news agency they
were fired upon by unidentified gunmen in a car parked near the
consulate, and they shot back. No injuries were reported.

   Windows were shot out and slurs were spray painted
on a Jewish temple, a Jewish community center and a mosque,
extending a yearlong string of vandalism at religious institutions.
   ``I think it's fairly clear that all three episodes are related
and done roughly within the same time period,'' said Mark Briskman,
regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
``That's clearly a rising of the level of the incidents _ that a
weapon was used to fire into the facilities.''
   The Mosque of Richardson, the Jewish Temple Shalom and the
Jewish Community Center were attacked sometime Saturday night,
police said.
   Vandals shot out windows and spray-painted red Nazi,
anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic slogans on all three buildings,
police said.
   Briskman said Jewish leaders believe a small group of white
supremacists, called skinheads because they shave their hair, may
be responsible for the attacks. Police are investigating.
   Since last November, at least eight minor anti-Semitic attacks
on Jewish institutions in Dallas have been reported to the
Anti-Defamation League.

<TEXT>
   Troops killed two people Sunday, and
rebels said thousands of students have joined their ranks to fight
the authoritarian regime that has ruled Burma for 26 years.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said troops shot at six suspected drug
addicts said to be resisting arrest in a northeast suburb, killing
one. A second person was reported shot and killed when the suspect
ran off after being challenged during the dusk-to-dawn curfew still
in effect in the capital.
   Since seizing power Sept. 18, Gen. Saw Maung's military
government has said its forces killed 440 people, including killing
looters, gamblers, curfew- breakers and anti-government
demonstrators. Western diplomats believe the number is higher.
   Saw Maung moved to quell anti-government protests, beginning
late July, that attempted to topple the military leadership that
has wielded power in Burma since 1962.
   The new government has allowed nine mostly opposition parties to
form and promised general elections. But opposition leaders say
they doubt free and fair elections can be held under the repressive
system.
   Nearly 9,000 students and other Burmese have joined rebel groups
at bases along the Thai border seeking refuge and arms to fight
their repressive government, rebel officials said Sunday.
   Another 4,000 students from Rangoon and other major cities have
arrived at camps of the Karen National Union, the strongest
ethnic-based insurgency, said Karen spokeswoman Naw Lydia.
   The rebel groups have waged war for four decades against the
government, which they say has reneged on promises of autonomy for
their ethnically distinct areas. They control vast tracts of the
country.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Four opposition leaders were
arrested, and two of them were beaten by soldiers, after a clash
between reformists and allies of the former Duvalier regime,
witnesses said Sunday.
   The four leaders of Artibonite province were arrested Saturday,
said Samuel Milord, a spokesman for the grassroots organization
Committee for the Defense of Peasant Rights.
   Milord identified those arrested as Dufort Charles, principal
opposition leader in the town of Desdunes, his brother Jackson,
Pierre Simon and Cheniere Santil, all members of the Association
for Development of Desdunes.
   Milord and two other town activists said Jackson Charles and
Santil were beaten by soldiers in the street.
   Government officials were not immediately available for comment.
   Desdunes, 50 miles north of the capital Port-au-Prince, was the
scene of a violent clash Thursday between demonstrators and an
armed gang known as ``The Steamrollers,'' Milord said. One man was
killed and five people were injured.
   The gang included what the three witnesses called ``Macoute
thugs.'' The Tonton Macoutes were the private police force of
former President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier, who was ousted and
fled to France in February 1986.
   He said that also among the 30 men armed with machetes,
revolvers and clubs were Jean-Baptiste Julien, a former development
adviser to ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy; a judge; the town's mayor
and soldiers.
   The three men say most of Desdunes' 14,000 inhabitants fled as a
result of repression by Duvalierists.
   The new president of the military government, Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, in power since Namphy was toppled Sept. 17, has vowed to rid
the country of Macoutes and establish democracy in Haiti.

   Emperor Hirohito, bedridden for three weeks, was in
stable condition Monday, but palace authorities said recovery of
his physical strength will be difficult.
   The 87-year-old emperor received 0.42 pints of blood Sunday. He
has received a total of 13.4 pints since his condition worsened.
The total is far more than the normal amount circulating in his
body, according to news reports.
   Hirohito's fever was 99 F Monday morning, unchanged from his
temperature Sunday evening, Imperial Household Agency spokesman
Kenji Maeda said. The emperor's normal temperature is 95.9 F.
   Maeda said there was no further discharge of blood from Sunday
evening through Monday morning.
   In a briefing Sunday evening, Maeda said the ``weakening of his
physical strength... (will make it) difficult for him to regain his
physical strength, and his recovery is not easy as he has been in
bed such a long time.''
   The emperor has been confined to his bed since he vomited a
large amount of blood Sept. 19. The monarch last discharged blood
four days ago.
   The Mainichi Shimbun Monday quoted sources close to palace
doctors as saying the emperor's jaundice ``has progressed'' and
said he is susceptible to hemorrhaging.
   It was the first time such signs have been confirmed, the
nationally circulated newspaper reported.
   News reports say Hirohito has pancreatic cancer, but officials
have neither confirmed nor denied the reports.

   Procedures for disposing of industrial waste
are laudable but not enough to protect the environment, the
chairman of the Monsanto Co. said Sunday.
   ``Society's telling us to change,'' said Richard Mahoney. ``We
had better listen. Environmentalists today aren't fringe-element
tree huggers. They're our neighbors, your students, our employees.
You and me.''
   Mahoney spoke to a gathering of chemists and chemical engineers
at the annual meeting of the Council for Chemical Research. He said
current efforts to minimize wastes are laudable but need to be
speeded up, even though the majority of discharges now are made
under strict permits and do not pose a hazard.
   ``Society makes the rules. Reducing wastes is about to become a
rule,'' he said. ``We have a chance now to do that our way _ the
science and technology way _ rather than have some other way
dictated to us later.''
   Mahoney said some of the technology needed to reduce air
emissions and other industrial wastes exists now, but other
technologies will have to be developed. Chemists and engineers will
be at the center of that work, he said.
   ``We're asking you to still keep the costs down, and improve
yields, but at the same time generate little or no waste as a
central part of your effort, not just a welcome byproduct,'' he
said.

   Dan Quayle was supposed to show the country
last week that he ``has no horns,'' as one adviser said. Instead,
the Republican vice presidential nominee remains the most
controversial candidate on either party's ticket.
   He admitted as much when he observed Friday that he had become
``the lightning rod for the campaign.''
   Aides say Quayle's debate with Democratic rival Lloyd Bentsen, a
confrontation many voters seem to think Quayle lost, has not
affected the campaign strategy for the Indiana senator or his
relationship with GOP nominee George Bush.
   But some Bush aides have been quoted as saying privately that
his debate performance was assessed as a negative. Bush himself
rarely mentions Quayle during campaign appearances unless he is

only rare departures from the script.

   Fewer than six out of 10 young people say they
have saved for college, and nearly 50 percent said tuition costs
prevent many from seeking a higher education, according to a poll
released Sunday.
   In addition, more than one out of three teen-agers and young
adults questioned in a survey commissioned by the Council for
Advancement and Support of Education believe the most expensive
colleges offer the best education.
   The poll, aimed at measuring student awareness of college
issues, was based on telephone interviews of 1,001 people age 13 to
21 from Aug. 24 to Sept. 7. It was released as part of National
Higher Education Week, which began Sunday. The poll, conducted by
the Gallup Organization, had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
   Thirty-eight percent agreed that ``the higher the tuition costs
of a college, the better the quality of education a student will
receive.'' Among pre-college-age students, the figures were higher:
53 percent of 13- to 15-year-olds agreed with the statement; 41
percent of 16- and 17-year-olds surveyed did. But only 27 percent
of current college students and graduates felt that way.

<TEXT>
   Shrouded in secrecy, computer industry
pioneer Steve Jobs finally is ready to launch what could become one
of the biggest booms or busts in Silicon Valley's short but
meteoric history.
   Jobs, the ``father'' of the Apple II and Macintosh, two of the
biggest selling computers of the PC generation, unveils his Next
Inc. computer workstation on Wednesday. It's a year late, prompting
critics to dub it ``Eventually.''
   Being shown before 3,000 people in San Francisco's posh Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall, the 2{-hour product demonstration is
designed to thrill the analysts, convert the doubters and confound
the competition.
   ``There has been a strong pooh-poohing of the Next computer for
a long time, a feeling Jobs' company could not come up with
anything that could make an impact,'' said Jonathan Seybold, a
leading Los Angeles-based trade publisher.
   Seybold, who has seen the Next, adds, ``They are all going to
change their minds.
   ``From a hardware and software standpoint, this is a remarkable
achievement ... and will have a significant impact that will spread
well beyond the number of computers Next will sell.''
   Although the shroud is being lifted after three years of
development and an exceptionally successful media blackout, the
computer won't immediately be available. Next will not say when the
machine will be on the market.
   At stake not only is the future of Jobs' second start-up company
_ he co-founded Apple Computer 12 years ago with Steve Wozniak _
but also Jobs' reputation as a genius entrepreneur. He shaped Apple
into the world's largest and most profitable company specializing
in personal computers in the world before being resigning under
pressure in 1985.
   Next's machine is designed with the power of an engineering
workstation, the kind that normally sells for upwards of $30,000 to
$50,000. Jobs has promised to offer it for considerably less, but
just how much less is unknown.
   Analysts early on speculated the machine would range from $3,000
to $5,000, but estimates now range up to $7,000 to $10,000.
   Jobs has said the Next computer was initially designed for
college students and academic researchers, although analysts
believe he now envisions a wider market.
   It's been speculated his machine will be capable of competing
with such hot-selling technical workstations as those from Sun
Microsystems Inc., Apollo Computer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Evidence of that are reports that IBM is paying $10 million for
the right to use the distinctive symbols and commands with which
the user will interact with Next.
   Industry executives last month told the New York Times that IBM
plans to use the Jobs technology on computers that run the Unix
operating system, the standard for technical workstations.
   IBM's use of Next's software technology, expected to be
announced Wednesday, could solve one of Jobs' biggest potential
problems _ the difficulty in getting software developers to spend
time converting their programs for the Next alone.
   Not everyone is convinced the Next will appeal to large audience.
   ``The expectations are out of touch with reality,'' Trip
Hawkins, president of San Mateo's Electronic Arts, told the San
Jose Mercury News. ``It will be a miracle if it is what people
say.''
   Some details of the computer have leaked out, the most reliable
one being its unusual visual design with a black magnesium case and
17-inch monochrome monitor.
   Dazzling color Display Postscript software and other software
are widely expected to give exceptionally vivid graphics _ possibly
offering photo-like realism _ and numerous type fonts and sizes. A
laser printer also is expected to be offered, which would vastly
improve industry reproduction quality standards.
   According to numerous published reports, the software is so
revolutionary _ or at least Jobs' computer designers hope so _ that
even non-programmers should be able to create software on a Next
machine.
   That would allow professors, for example, to illustrate complex
math and science ideas with their own graphics.
   In hardware, the Mercury News reports Next is expected to come
with an erasable optical disk drive, which could increase current
computer storage as much as 50 times and allow the storage of
detailed images such as photographs.
   Optical drives also can give computers the ability to play
stereo digital music.
   Jobs himself has indicated the computer will have a 32-bit
Motorola 68030 chip, one of the industry's fastest; a connector to
an industry standard network called Ethernet that will allow Next
to share files with other types of computers; and Mathematica
software, of special use for sophisticated math equations.
   Other reports indicate the system also may feature a high-speed
modem allowing it to work with facsimile machines, optional digital
audiotape storage, and the ability to display television-quality
video signals, not now available on any other personal computers.
   Jobs founded Next in 1985 after leaving Apple in a power
struggle with Apple's chief executive officer, John Sculley.
   In early 1987, H. Ross Perot, the flamboyant founder of General
Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Inc. unit, invested $20
million in Next and holds a 16 percent stake in the company. Jobs
has invested $12 million of his own money and holds a 63 percent
stake.
   Seybold says the Next will prove to a skeptical industry that
the past success of the 33-year-old Jobs, once dubbed ``the
accidental millionaire'' by an author who dismissed his alleged
business acumen as luck, was not a fluke.
   ``The Next clearly shows that there is no question that Steve
has proved he really is extraordinary and ... is the kind of leader
who gets people to achieve what they felt they couldn't achieve.''

   U.S. corporate controllers increasingly expect
an economic recession next year, with the group overwhelmingly
predicting a recession by 1990, according to a survey by the
National Association of Accountants.
   The controllers, who are responsible for the budgets and
forecasts of their companies, also ranked interest rates as the
factor having the greatest impact on the economy over the next six
months.
   The Montvale, N.J.-based trade group said 47 percent of the
respondents to its fourth quarter economic outlook survey expected
a recession in 1989, compared with 39 percent in the third quarter
outlook survey. Some 57 percent of the respondents expect the
economy to be the same or better 12 months from now.
   For 1990, 62 percent expect a recession, compared with 56
percent in the third quarter outlook.
   The NAA surveyed 3,200 members of its Controllers Counsel during
the fourth week of September, getting a 31 percent response rate.
   Asked to rank the top five factors with the greatest impact on
the economy in the next six months, nearly twice as many executives
chose interest rates as the top factor than any other. Inflation
was ranked second, followed by the federal budget deficit; the
presidential election; and the fluctuation of the dollar.

<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government expressed ``extreme regret and
astonishment'' Sunday at Britain's demand it more than halve its
stake in British Petroleum Co. and said it has taken steps to
protect its foreign investments.
   But an official statement did not say what those measures were.
   The statement was the first official comment by Kuwait since
Britain's Trade Secretary, Lord Young, told Kuwait on Tuesday to
reduce its holding in BP from 21.69 percent to 9.9 percent over the
next year.
   The statement was announced by the Minister of State for Cabinet
Affairs, Rashed Abdul-Aziz al-Rashed, after the weekly cabinet
session chaired by Kuwait's crown prince and prime minister, Sheik
Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah.
   In response to a reporter's question after the cabinet session,
al-Rashed said: ``The cabinet has discussed this subject and
decided to take all necessary steps to protect Kuwait's economic
interests in Britain.
   ``Kuwait expressed its extreme regret and astonishment at the
decision of the British government to reduce the stake of Kuwait in
BP from 21.6 to 9.9 percent,'' he said.
   ``The government studied all suitable measures and at all levels
with a view to protecting its economic interests and its
investments abroad,'' he said.
   Kuwait has an estimated $85 billion of accumulated petrodollars
from the oil boom years of the 1970's in overseas holdings.
One-fifth of that is invested in Britain.
   Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission had advised that the
Kuwaiti investment might ``operate against the public interest''
and the Trade Secretary acted on that recommendation.
   The investments are placed through the state-owned Kuwait
Investment Office. The London-based KIO bought 1.316 billion BP
shares after the British government sold off its one-third stake in
the oil giant last year.
   The KIO stands to lose an estimated $676 million at current
market prices if it cuts its BP holdings to the level the British
demand.

<HEAD>Magazine: Recession Will Usher In Moderate Growth, Inflation In
1990s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy of the 1990s may get off to a shaky
start, but in the longer-term it could feature steady growth,
higher taxes, high employment and low interest rates, according to
a forecast by Money magazine.
   The magazine, in a special Fall 1988 edition, also predicted
that while the 1990a economy would not necessarily boom, it would
provide a good background for another bull market in stocks and
bonds.
   Money said its forecast was based on observations by a panel of
six economic and social experts, plus interviews with about 300
economists, demographers, investment analysts, futurists and others
who monitor trends and forecast change.
   The magazine indicated its experts generally expected no
economic recession during this election year. It also predicted
that when a recession did occur it should be mild by historical
standards, tempered by the continued steady demand for services,
which now account for 67 percent of the gross national product and
90 percent of new jobs.
   Furthermore, the increasingly deregulated global economy tends
to be more self-regulating, the magazine stated, with interest
rates rising in overheated economies to help choke off inflation
and economic booms, thus lessening the severity of booms and busts.
   Among other predictions for the 1990s:
   _Following recession, the economy will enjoy moderate inflation
and steady, moderate growth;
   _Unemployment could fall as low as 4 percent due to the expected
``baby bust'' that will see workforce growth slow sharply;
   _The dollar will decline slightly but will bottom out, helping
further trim the U.S. trade deficit;
   _The next president _ whoever it is _ will raise taxes within
two years;
   _Long-term interest rates will peak at 10.5 percent to 11
percent and later fall to as low as 5 percent, due to lower credit
demand during the recession;
   _The Dow Jones industrial average _ now at about 2,150 _ will
hit 3,000 early in the next decade as falling interest rates on
bonds encourage investors to switch to stocks;
   _Investors increasingly will invest for the long-term, amid
sagging confidence in Social Security and increasing awareness of
rising future costs, such as college.
   Pessimists among the magazine's experts warned the 1990s
scenario could be bleak, with the recession possibly deepening into
a depression. A worst-case scenario could be set up by:
   _Faulty U.S. government policy, such as a tax increase that
might stifle economic growth by forcing debt-burdened consumers to
cut their spending, reducing a key GNP component;
   _A surge in bank failures that also might prompt consumers to
cut spending drastically;
   _Protectionism combining with a recently-stronger dollar to
widen the nation's trade deficit;
   _A crash of the high-flying Japanese stock market, which could
cause huge Japanese investment firms to dump U.S. stocks and bonds,
forcing interest rates here to skyrocket.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Florida's $1.3 billion-a-year citrus
industry is grappling with problems that overshadow the beginning
of what otherwise could be a storybook season.
   Prices of orange juice futures traded on the New York Cotton
Exchange closed Friday at $1.707 a pound for January delivery, up
about 100 percent in the past two years, the Orlando Sentinel
reported Sunday.
   But there is continued legal wrangling over the canker
eradication program, an investigation into the export practices of
processors that could give the industry a black eye, and an unknown
impact on the global orange juice market from Brazil, which in 1982
surpassed Florida as the world's largest orange producer.
   ``The citrus industry is in good shape economically, but those
who have fruit are doing very well, and those who don't have fruit
are struggling financially,'' Bobby McKown, executive vice
president of Florida Citrus Mutual in Lakeland, told the newspaper.
   The 40-year-old trade group is the state's largest citrus
growers association, with more than 12,000 members.
   Mild weather prevailed for the past three winters, spurring
Florida growers to plant a record-high 125,000 acres of fruit trees
in 1986 and 1987. But growers on the northern edge of the Citrus
Belt, hit hardest by the earlier freezes, accounted for about 30
percent of the new plantings.
   Members of the Florida Citrus Commission, which oversees the
state Citrus Department, say they expect about 147.7 million boxes
of oranges and 54.4 million boxes of grapefruit to be picked this
season. A box equals 90 pounds.
   That would be almost 50 percent more oranges and 22 percent more
grapefruit than were harvested during the freeze-shortened 1984-85
season.
   Growers reaped a record $1.3 billion for their fruit during the
1987-88 season, eclipsing a record $1.03 billion set in the bumper
crop season of 1979-80, according to a preliminary report released
nine days ago. The wholesale value, including the cost of
harvesting and transportation, was estimated at about $3.3 billion.
   Although high prices are lifting the spirits of growers, the
industry is facing severe tests on a number of fronts.
   The U.S. Supreme Court last week let stand a Florida court
ruling that requires the state to pay full market value for healthy
trees destroyed in the canker eradication program. About 20 million
trees were burned, and growers were reimbursed about $17 million as
partial compensation. Full compensation might cost more than $200
million.
   Officials of the state Agriculture Department say it would be up
to the Legislature to decide any additional compensation, but
legislators have shown little enthusiasm for taking such action.
   Another controversy threatens to spill into courtrooms. U.S.
Customs officials in Tampa last week announced that criminal fraud
charges had been filed against Allsun Pure Juice Corp. The Polk
County juice processor is charged with defrauding the government of
at least $750,000 in import fees by mislabeling products to obtain
import fee refunds.
   An investigation of the practices of other processing companies
is continuing, said Brad Knutter, a Customs fraud investigation
supervisor.
   ``Obviously we can't guarantee (other) indictments, but if we
didn't think there was more fraud out there, we wouldn't say that
we consider this just the beginning,'' said Knutter.
   Brazil is the final question mark.
   If Brazilian crops are large and juicy, that can mean lower
prices for Florida fruit. But if the Brazilians decide to export
more orange juice to Europe, as they did last year, that can mean
higher prices in Florida.
   While Florida growers and processors have a difficult enough
time keeping track of the state of their own industry, divining the
situation in Brazil is even tricker. Brazil does not conduct its
own scientific surveys to make monthly crop forecasts as does
Florida.
   ``Brazil is definitely the wild card,'' said Phil Herndon,
president of Alcoma Packing Co., a citrus processing company in
Polk County.

<HEAD>Libya Calls For Extraordinary OPEC Meeting On Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya on Sunday called for an extraordinary meeting
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to restore
falling oil prices.
   According to the official Libyan news agency JANA, monitored
here, Libya called for a urgent conference of the OPEC Ministerial
Council as soon as possible.
   It said the council should ``take the necessary measures to stop
the fall in prices, restore stability to the oil market and to take
prices up to levels which are fair to both consumer and producer.''
   Oil prices tumbled last week to their lowest levels since 1986,
and now are just under $13 a barrel in the U.S. futures market.
   Some analysts blamed the sharp decline on indications that more
Saudi Arabian crude will be flowing into the market. The Saudis
have indicated they may hike production unless other members of the
13-nation OPEC adhere to production quotas aimed at supporting a
benchmark price of $18 a barrel.
   JANA said Libya's decision to call for the extraordinary meeting
was made ``after consultation with some OPEC member countries.''

   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham
Nazer has denied reports that the kingdom intends to pull out of
the 13-nation OPEC because some of the cartel's member states were
violating set production quotas.
   In a statement distributed late Saturday by the official Saudi
Press Agency, Nazer stressed that the kingdom would push for
adherence to the quotas assigned by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   ``The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has not thought of pulling out of
OPEC,'' he said. ``The media have been giving unjustified
explanations of the cabinet statement which was worded carefully so
as to avoid any interpretations.''
   Last Monday, following a regular cabinet meeting chaired by King
Fahd, Saudi Arabia said it would not accept that some members of
OPEC cheat on their production quotas at its expense.
   It said the kingdom was prepared to abide by its quota of 4.343
million barrels a day provided the others adhered to their quotas.
It also stressed it was not prepared to re-assume the role of
``swing producer,'' committing the kingdom to curtail its output
when others exceed theirs.
   Saudi Arabia, Nazer said, ``is not satisfied with the current
market situation nor does it consider it of its making, and it
still calls for a return to the defined production levels and will
be the first to abide by them.''
   Nazer said OPEC states which were disturbed by the current oil
market situation ``should return to quota levels and help restore
stability to the oil market.''
   Overproduction by some of the cartel's member states has
generated a glut on the world oil market, forcing prices to drop
about $5 below OPEC's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   The kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter and the leading
member of the cartel, produced more than 10 million barrels a day
at the peak of the oil boom in 1982.
   Oil industry reports have estimated that Saudi Arabia has
exceeded its quota, producing about 6 million barrels a day. The
reports speculated the kingdom was deliberately boosting its
production to enforce discipline within OPEC.

   The nation's unemployment rate in September
fell back to July's level of 5.4 percent, but with the loss of
37,000 factory jobs in the meantime, the government said.
   Employers added 255,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month,
sending the number of unemployed workers down by a like figure to
6,596,000, the Labor Department reported Friday.
   The unemployment total was the lowest it has been since June,
when the jobless rate hit a 14-year-low of 5.3 percent.

   The nation's business leaders, enjoying
high profits from the strongest economic growth in four years, said
they expect a slowdown in 1989.
   Executives ranging from Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed to
General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith said Friday that their
industries are generating very strong earnings.
   Nevertheless, the chief executives said they would prefer less
robust growth and a ``soft landing'' next year to the alternative:
higher inflation, rising interest rates and finally a recession, or
a ``hard landing.''

   Americans took out consumer credit at an
annual rate of 10.1 percent in August, up substantially from the
July borrowing pace, the government reported.
   The Federal Reserve said Friday that consumers took out $5.44
billion more in credit than they paid off in August, as auto loans
and credit card debt grew more rapidly.
   Consumer debt had risen $3.62 billion in July, a 6.7 percent
annual rate, as the pace of borrowing slowed momentarily following
several months of rapid gains.

   Children around the world have played
with springy Slinkies for 43 years, but the 70-year-old woman who
helped invent the wire toy says it hasn't been all fun and games.
   Betty James, president of James Industries Inc., says her late
husband, Richard James, a mechanical engineer and naval architect,
came up with the idea of the toy in 1943 while aboard a ship. He
saw a torsion spring fall from a table and bounce.
   Mrs. James took control of the business in 1960, when her
husband lost interest and left the family to join what she called a
religious cult in Bolivia. He died there in 1974.
   ``To this day,'' she said, ``I don't know what a torsion spring
is.''
   James Industries is a spartan, no-nonsense firm that turns out
Slinkies by the millions in this small central Pennsylvania town.
It employs 120 people who manufacture, package, sell and ship
Slinkies from a single building.
   A grandmother of 10, Mrs. James says she's basically a doting
mother devoted to her six adult children and their families.
According to her oldest son, she's also a demanding and assertive
boss.
   ``She expects a lot out of you. She expects you to produce. And,
so you do produce,'' said Richard James II, 46. He is Slinky sales
manager and the only one of three sons and three daughters to join
the family business.
   Mrs. James, who is known as ``Big Betty,'' is not too big to
take telephone messages for her staff and do many other tasks.
``When we first moved into this building, I used to clean the
toilets, too,'' she said.
   She's been involved in every aspect of production and promotion.
   Slinky was put on the market in 1945, after the Jameses spent
two years experimenting with various types of steel.
   After receiving a patent, they demonstrated the toys at a
Gimbel's department store in Philadelphia. ``They gave us the end
of a counter so we could show how it walked,'' Mrs. James recalled.
   ``I was so scared that no one would buy them, I called a friend
and asked her to come along. I thought we would each buy one if
nobody else did,'' she said.
   She needn't have worried. After a quick demonstration, the first
400 Slinkies sold out in 90 minutes at a dollar each.
   ``I was so taken aback when I saw this crowd of people _ and
everyone was waving dollar bills.''
   Each night, Mrs. James took the day's production home from the
manufacturer and wrapped the Slinkies by hand with yellow paper.
   Richard James, meanwhile, came up with other inventions, but
none were successful.
   ``He was a dreamer,'' she said. ``He developed a refrigerator
that would dispense soft drinks, but we took it out because we were
drinking so many soft drinks we were getting fat. He also wanted to
work on an amphibious car.''
   When her husband left, Mrs. James struggled to keep the business
alive to feed herself and her children.
   ``To me, my family is the most precious thing in life. ... I
always wanted a family because I was an only child,'' she said.
``You do what you have to do for them. I did what I had to do.''
   The first Slinky plant was in Philadelphia's Germantown section.
Mrs. James moved to Hollidaysburg, 180 miles away, 23 years ago
because she had family and friends in the area who could help care
for her children.
   The family moved a year and a half before the company's move was
complete, and Mrs. James commuted to Philadelphia each week. She
drove to Philadelphia on Sunday evenings, returning home on
Thursdays.
   ``It was hard to see her crying because she had to leave the six
of us,'' her son Richard said.
   Today, James Industries sells millions of Slinkies around the
world. Mrs. James, who with her children owns all company stock,
declined to release the number of units sold annually or annual
sales figures. Slinkies usually retail for less than $2.
   The company produces other toys, including building blocks,
plastic rings, games and pin wheels. ``But Slinky outsells them
all,'' Mrs. James said.
   ``It's simple. It's a universal toy. It's a toy that doesn't
need any explanation. It has intrinsic play value,'' her son said.
``There are very few other toys like that.''
   James Industries began producing brightly colored plastic
Slinkies in 1979, to appeal to younger children, especially infants.
   Mrs. James and her son gasp at the thought of updating the
television commercial jingle that declares ``Slinky, Slinky ...
Everyone loves a Slinky.'' The song was written in 1963.
   ``We'll just stick to something that's good,'' she said.

<HEAD>Silbert Resigning as CEO-Chairman, Barbakow Will Take Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen D. Silbert is resigning as
board chairman and chief executive officer of MGM-UA Communications
Co., and Merrill Lynch executive Jeffrey C. Barbakow will take over
as president.
   The studio announced Sunday that Silbert was resigning to take a
position with Tracinda Corp., the company's principal shareholder,
becoming the latest to join an exodus of top executives from MGM-UA.
   ``I assumed the chairman's postion at MGM-UA as an interim step
until a permanent team could be named,'' Silbert explained.
   Barbakow, managing director in charge of the Pacific Southwest
Region of the Investment Banking Division of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, has expertise on mergers and and acquisitions, MGM-UA said
in a news release.
   ``We will implement the plans recently announced by the
company,'' Barbakow said in the statement. ``Moreover, we expect to
supplement the company's financial resources in order to resume a
full development and production slate and to provide capital for
the company's other operations.''
   The company said only that Barbakow would be named ``later this
week.''
   MGM-UA also announced that Kenin M. Spivak, also an
entertainment industry specialist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets,
will be named executive vice president, and Trevor Fetter, also of
Merrill Lynch, will be net senior vice president.
   Silbert will remain with the company until Jan. 15 to assist
Barbakow in the transition, the company said. He also will remain a
member of the executive committee and the board of directors of
MGM-UA.
   A corporate restructuring of MGM-UA includes a $200 million plan
that calls for present stockholders to be given the right to buy
additional new shares in MGM-UA, maker of Academy Award-winning
``Moonstruck,'' the company said last month.
   The restructuring, disclosed in a cryptic announcement by
MGM-UA, appears to depend on a substantial injection of cash from
Kirk Kerkorian, the Los Angeles investor who owns 79 percent of the
show-business conglomerate.
   Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. intends to buy any of the new shares
that aren't taken by other stockholders, the company said.
   Recent executive departures at MGM-UA include ex-UA chairman and
chief executive Anthony Thomopoulos, MGM-UA chairman and chief
executive Lee Rich and MGM production unit chief Alan Ladd Jr.
   ``I believe that by creating a stable environment with ample
funds available for production, MGM-UA will be able to strengthen
its position as a major supplier of entertainment programming,''
Barbakow said. ``We intend to draw upon our strong business
relationships in the community and our comprehensive experience in
arranging financings to maximize the value of the company.''
