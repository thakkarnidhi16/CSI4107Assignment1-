<HEAD>Farley Ordered To Stand Trial; Charges Expanded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former employee of a Sunnyvale defense
contractor was ordered Friday to stand trial for the shooting
deaths of seven people during a 5{-hour rampage at the plant in
February.
   Richard Wade Farley, 39, a onetime software engineer at ESL
Inc., was scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 2 in Superior Court. No
trial date has been set.
   Santa Clara County Municipal Court Judge Edwin Pearce ordered a
trial for Farley at a preliminary hearing following nearly two
weeks of testimony from police and ESL employees who were present
the day of the Feb. 16 massacre.
   Police say that Farley burst into the ESL plant Feb. 16, loaded
down with weapons, and fired at least 100 rounds, killing seven
people and wounding three including a former co-worker who had
spurned his romantic advances.
   Also Friday, prosecutor Alan Nudelman said he was adding three
charges of attempted murder and reducing one attempted-murder
charge to assault with a deadly weapon.
   With those changes, Farley would face seven counts of murder and
five of attempted murder as well as charges of burglary, vandalism
and assault with a deadly weapon.
   The additional charges follow the testimony of ESL employees
Randall Hemingway, Karen Mackey and William Drake that Farley shot
at them and missed during the siege.
   The reduced charge relates to the shooting of ESL engineer Laura
Black, whose rejections of Farley's repeated advances were cited as
the reason for the rampage. Last week, a tape was played of
Farley's conversation with police the night of the siege in which
he said that he wanted Black to survive the attack so she would
live with regret that she had rejected him.
   ``I am convinced it was not his intent to kill Laura Black,''
Nudelman said. ``That would have defeated his purpose.''
   Nudelman said he decided not to ask Black to testify at the
hearing because Farley is an ``emotional rapist'' who would have
derived satisfaction from seeing her on the witness stand. But he
said he would ``most assuredly'' seek her testimony at his trial.
   Farley had been fired from the plant in 1986, in part for
harassing Black. She eventually obtained a judge's ruling, shortly
before the shootings, ordering Farley to stay away from her.

projects.

   A newspaper said Saturday that rescuers have
pulled 10 bodies from a southwest China river after a boat
capsized, but authorities were still not sure how many more are
missing.
   The overseas edition of the official People's Daily said
Saturday that 10 bodies had been found and 148 people had been
rescued from the fast-moving waters of the Min River, a tributary
of the Yangtze in Sichuan province.
   The daily said 16 of the rescued had been hospitalized.
   The official Xinhua News Agency in a report late Friday said 152
people had been rescued after the boat hit a rock and sank.
   It was not known if any foreigners were on the boat.
   Xinhua reported Thursday that 250 people were on the boat, but
local officials said by telephone Friday the exact number of
passengers was not known because the boat made frequent stops.
   Another report in the Peasant Daily said the boat was carrying
its capacity of 324.
   Tang Langmin, an official of the Chongqing Shipping Co., owners
of the vessel, told The Associated Press that there are still no
accurate estimates of those on board.
   Tang said the cause of the accident is still not clear, although
earlier reports said the boat hit a rock.
   He said it is unlikely that there were any foreigners aboard
because the area is still closed to foreign visitors.
   Among those rescued were 16 crew members, China News Service
said. It said six people required hospitalization but did not give
details of their injuries.
   The report quoted Sichuan officials as saying rescue work was
difficult because the accident occurred in a remote area and the
river level was high.
   The boat sank in Qianwei County, about 116 miles south of the
provincial capital of Chengdu.
   Xinhua said an investigation was under way.
   Sichuan Gov. Zhang Haoru and Vice Gov. Ma Lin went to the scene,
said an official at the Foreign Affairs Office in nearby Leshan,
contacted by telephone.

<HEAD>Barge Traffic Flowing More Freely on Ohio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUND CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent rains in the nation's midsection
have raised the waters of the Ohio River enough to clear a logjam
of barge traffic that has existed for weeks, the Coast Guard said
Friday.
   The Ohio River, like the Mississippi and Missouri, had shrunk to
all-time lows earlier this month. At one point, 84 barge tows were
backed up on the Ohio near this Southern Illinois town a few miles
north of the the point where the Ohio meets the Mississippi.
   But by Friday evening, all backed-up barges had cleared the area
and all size restrictions on the tows were lifted, said Coast Guard
Ensign Rick Johnson.
   Upriver at Louisville, the Ohio averaged 5 billion gallons of
water a day during the first half of the month _ 84 percent below
normal, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
   The current flow rate wasn't available Friday, but during one
24-hour period this week the river rose 5 feet, Johnson said. The
river stage at Cairo was 6.1 feet Tuesday and 12.69 feet Friday, he
said.
   However, the Coast Guard continued to rout traffic one way at a
time through an auxiliary channel near Mound City while a dredge
scooped out silt from the main route.
   ``It still has a lot of work to do in the area,'' Johnson said.
   The question of whether barge traffic continues to flow freely
will be answered by the amount of rainfall, he added.
   ``I don't know how long it will stay this way,'' Johnson said.
``If we get a dry spell like we've been having, the river will go
right back down and we'll be back where we were.''

   A defrocked Lutheran minister and leader of a
radical protest group was jailed on a contempt charge following an
angry exchange with a judge.
   Daniel Solberg, 38, a member of the anti-corporation
Denominational Ministry Extended, was placed in the Allegheny
County Jail on Thursday after county Judge David Cercone found him
in contempt of court for repeatedly refusing to participate in jury
selection.
   Solberg, brother of actor David Soul, was to go on trial
Thursday on criminal charges of defiant trespass and harassment
stemming from a protest Nov. 1 at Nativity Lutheran Church in
Hampton Township.
   Solberg was pastor of the church for six years until a dispute
over his DMX activities cost him his pastorate. He was defrocked
two years ago.
   Thursday's dispute erupted after Solberg, who was representing
himself, asked Cercone to order an out-of-county jury to hear the
case and permit each potential juror to be questioned individually.
The motions were denied.

   A brother of singer-actress Madonna has
been charged with attacking a woman, the third assault charge
against him this year, according to a police report.
   An arrest warrant was issued Wednesday for Mario Ciccone, 18, of
nearby Rochester Hills in the June 26 incident involving the
18-year-old woman.
   According to the report filed with Oakland County sheriff's
deputies, the two had been riding in a car in Rochester Hills, a
northern Detroit suburb, when they began arguing. The couple got
out of the car, and Ciccone hit the woman and threw her to the
ground, the report said.
   Ciccone, who is in Thailand where his brother-in-law, Sean Penn,
is making a movie, will be notified by mail to appear to answer the
warrant, authorities said.
   The other two assault charges are on hold until his scheduled
return Sept. 1.
   Ciccone is charged with assault and battery in an April 16
incident at a Rochester house, in which an officer was slammed in
the face by a door while investigating a noise complaint. The
officer required stitches and plastic surgery.
   Ciccone also is charged with assault and battery in a case in
Bloomfield Township in which he allegedly threw a pair of pliers at
a car Jan. 8.

<DATELINE>OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kunitoyo Kawachi seems to find honest
Americans whenever he visits the United States from Osaka, Japan.
   Kawachi lost $1,080 this week while pedaling his bike here. In
1974, he lost $4,000 in Los Angeles. Both times the money was
returned.
   The airplane enthusiast was riding a bicycle after renewing his
membership at the Experimental Aircraft Association Tuesday when he
lost his wallet.
   The money, intially reported at $800, was Kawachi's spending
money for the EAA convention, which starts later this month.
Kawachi has attended the convention for 15 years.
   An Oshkosh City Cab driver, Mark Framnes, said he saw money
blowing out of a wallet in the middle of a road while he was
driving at about noon Tuesday.
   ``First I thought, Las Vegas, I've hit the jackpot, especially
with all that money,'' Framnes said. ``But I'm very honest and my
conscience wouldn't let me keep the money.''
   Framnes ran around a nearby field and collected any bills that
had escaped.
   ``I counted it and I just couldn't believe it. I was shaking,''
Framnes said.
   He called the cab dispatcher to report what he had found. Then
he took the money to his safe deposit box for storing until the
owner could be located.
   A cab company employee noticed an article about the money in the
Oshkosh Northwestern newspaper on Wednesday and called the paper to
make arrangements for reuniting Kawachi and his cash.
   Kawachi expressed his thanks through interpreter Penny Elwing,
and promised to send a wedding present to Framnes when he marries
in the spring.
   ``I am so grateful, and so thankful,'' Kawachi said. ``He
(Framnes) is ... so honest.''
   Elwing said Kawachi hadn't given his money up for lost, since
more than twice the amount was returned in California 14 years
before.

<HEAD>GOP Planning Challenge to Bentsen's Use of Senate Campaign Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans say they plan to begin a
challenge, possibly as early as today, in an effort to keep Lloyd
Bentsen's hands off his Senate campaign kitty now that he also is
officially the Democratic nominee for vice president.
   Although Bentsen's two races are legal in Texas, the dual
candidacies are unprecedented since presidential campaigns became
publicly financed in 1976, and the National Republican Senatorial
Committee plans to mount a challenge.
   Republicans contend Bentsen, nominated as Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis' running mate Thursday night
in Atlanta, should be barred from spending his Senate contributions
because they also will benefit the Democratic presidential
campaign, which is limited to spending $46 million in public funds.
   ``We're going to sit back and go to school on how these guys
bend, break and mutilate the spending limits in the presidential
election,'' said Ben Ginsberg, legal counsel to the committee.
   Bentsen, who has a reputation for being one of the most
successful fund-raisers in Congress, raised $6.1 million from Jan.
1, 1987, to June 30 of this year, while his Republican challenger
in his Senate race, Rep. Beau Boulter, has collected $587,254
during the period, according to the Federal Election Commission.
   Ginsberg said the group tentatively planned to file a petition
with the FEC today seeking to block certification of
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket so the team can't receive public campaign
money. The petition is the first step to challenging Bentsen's use
of his Senate campaign funds, Ginsberg said.
   Texas, with its 29 electoral votes, will be a prime battleground
in the race for president between Dukakis and the certain
Republican nominee, Vice President George Bush, who calls Houston
home.
   The GOP contends Dukakis will have an unfair advantage in the
Lone Star State and elsewhere as long as Bentsen can raise and
spend unlimited amounts on his Senate campaign.
   If Bentsen were to drop out of the Senate race before the
November election, Boulter would win the seat. Should Bentsen win
both races and become vice president, Gov. Bill Clements would
appoint a successor pending a special election.
   Nearly $1.7 million of the $6.1 million Bentsen raised during
1987 and the first six months of this year was from political
action committee contributions. Boulter collected $73,911 in PAC
donations during the period.
   Bentsen spent about $3 million during the 18 month-period, while
Boulter spent $582,721, according to finance reports filed this
week with the FEC.
   Based on campaign finance reports for the period Jan. 1, 1987,
to the end of March 1988, the FEC ranked Bentsen as the leader
among congressional candidates in overall contributions and PAC
receipts.
   For the spring reporting period, April 1 through June 30,
Bentsen raised and spent just over $1 million. About $236,169 of
the money raised came from PAC contributions.

   The head of an Arab-American group is
condemning a federal prosecutor who said one of eight men accused
of illegal pro-Libyan activities was involved in a plot to
assassinate a high-level U.S. official.
   An administration source later identified the target as former
National Security Council aide Oliver L. North.
   The comments by U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson about an
assassination plot are ``outrageous ... unsubstantiated allegations
which are not even part of the charges in this case,'' Abdeen
Jabara, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee, said Thursday.
   Hudson made the comments Wednesday in Alexandria, Va., in a
court appearance by six men charged with violating the U.S.
economic boycott of Libya.
   The men allegedly used money sent from Libya to support
pro-Libya demonstrations in the United States and to finance travel
to Libya by American minorities. The boycott allows such money to
be used only for the educational expenses of Libyan students in the
United States.
   Two other men were charged in the same case, in Denver and Ann
Arbor, Mich.
   During the Alexandria court appearance, Hudson said one of those
charged, Mousa Hawamda, ``was involved in a potential plot to
assassinate a high government official of the United States.'' An
administration source, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
identified the target as North, who as a National Security Council
aide masterminded counterterrorism activities against Libya,
including the April 1986 bombing of Tripoli.
   One of Hawamda's attorneys, Russell Gaspar, said in an interview
that ``we deny on behalf of Hawamda involvement in any sort of
assassination plot.'' He said he and Hawamda's other attorney, Ray
Hanna, would seek to have their client released. All six were
detained without bond.
   Jabara also said his office has received a recent rash of calls
from Arab-Americans across the nation who have been harassed by the
FBI with unannounced visits to them and their neighbors that were
intended to gather information about political views and activities
as opposed to criminal activities.
   Sue Schnitzer, an FBI spokeswoman, had no comment on Jabara's
remarks. She said information about political views and activities
might be sought in investigations involving, for example, foreign
counterintelligence or terrorism. But she denied that the bureau
would conduct an investigation that was politically motivated.

   Here is the transcript of the speech delivered by
Ohio Sen. John Glenn introducing Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas to the
Democratic National Convention Thursday night.
   Thank you. Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you.
   Thank you all very, very much this evening.
   I just knew I'd be making a speech tonight about the vice
presidency.
   And I am here to say this: Ohio Democrats will rally to this
ticket _ and on November 8th, Ohio will lead the way in giving
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen the victory that will change the
course of this nation. Thank you.
   Now _ now I don't know _ now I don't know, of course, who George
Bush will choose as his running mate.
   But I do know that Lloyd Bentsen will be the next vice president
of the United States.
   And he is superbly qualified for the job.
   War hero . . . lawyer . . . businessman ... congressman ...
senator ... chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
   And you want to know something? To get to the Senate in 1970,
Lloyd Bentsen beat George Bush.
   And this November, he and Michael Dukakis will do it again.
   And _ and they'll win because _ and that's because Lloyd Bentsen
not only comes from Texas, but he's a real Texan.
   Now we all know, we all here know that there are other people
who say they're real Texans, too.
   But let me ask you this question:
   How many real Texans do you know whose idea of Mexican food is
re fried quiche?
   And there are many other differences as well.
   This administration talks about fiscal responsibility.
   But their plan consists of the same old formula: more tax cuts
for the rich and more budget cuts for everyone else.
   Well, Lloyd Bentsen believes it's time we stopped asking this
nation to choose between fiscal responsibility and moral
responsibility.
   Lloyd Bentsen knows we must have both _ and he rejects the idea
that we should be hard on needy children, and easy on greedy
defense contractors.
   And Lloyd Bentsen knows that on economics, the Republicans have
it backwards: true prosperity always flows up from the people _ and
never trickles down from the powerful.
   This White House says there's nothing we can do about unfair
foreign trade that closes American factories and steals American
jobs.
   Well, Lloyd Bentsen believes that when other countries take
advantage of us, you can't talk like Rambo, and act like Bambi.
   And Lloyd Bentsen knows that with the right tools and a fair
chance, America can still outwork, out invent, out produce and out
compete any nation on the face of this earth.
   And when it comes to women's rights and civil rights, George
Bush is part of an administration that has consistently taken its
cues from right-wing zealots.
   They gloated about the temporary defeat of the ERA _ and then
boasted about appointing a woman to the Supreme Court.
   Well, Lloyd Bentsen knows there is a huge difference between
making one woman a Justice _ and bringing justice to American women.
   Let me add just another note here about the right wing. Let me
say that I am also tired of right-wing religious extremism.
   And of those who believe that they and only hold the truth. Now
on both things, we Democrats are willing to compromise for the good
of the country. But when it comes to the separation of church and
state, there must and should be no compromise.
   We Democrats treasure our churches and we treasure our faiths.
I've been an elder in the Presbyterian church for over 25 years.
But I'll tell you what I believe: I believe that the last thing
that this country needs is to have the gospels of Matthew, Mark,
Luke and John rewritten by Meese, Bakker, Swaggart and Falwell.
   Our opponents also talk about law and order _ and about how
George Bush will be tough on crime.
   But in this administration, over 100 officials have already been
indicted or left office under an ethical cloud.
   Yet despite that record, they tell us they want ``four more
years.''
   Well, I can tell you something: at the rate they're going, I
think some of 'em are going to end up serving ten to twenty.
   You know, you know, I saw Vice President Bush on TV the other
day talking about how Democrats are somehow ``soft'' on defense _
and that bothered me. In fact, it angered me.
   Lloyd Bentsen was a combat bomber pilot during World War II _
and he knows that we Americans must always be ready to defend
ourselves, because the very first obligation of government is to
keep our people alive, and independent and free.
   And if American lives are ever at stake during the next
administration _ whether in Beirut, the Persian Gulf or anywhere
else _ I can promise you that when major decisions are being made,
Vice President Bentsen will not be out of the room, out of pocket,
out of town, or out of touch.
   And I can tell you this: when Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen
tell us they will make ``no deals'' with terrorists like the
Ayatollah or drug-pushing dictators like Noriega, they mean no way,
no lies, no secrets, no deals _ period.
   My fellow Democrats, I am indeed honored to introduce a decent
and caring man, a good friend, a great senator, and the next vice
president of the United States _ Lloyd Bentsen.

   Jesse Jackson, setting aside disagreements and
disappointment, strode to the convention podium Thursday night to
stand with Michael Dukakis in the unity gesture the Democratic
presidential nominee had long desired.
   ``We have a good ticket and a good team,'' Jackson said
afterward. ``And if the unity that is expressed here tonight is
sustained and expands, we will win and we will deserve to win,'' he
said.
   ``I feel fantastic.''
   The packed hall exploded in cheers as Jackson and his wife
joined Dukakis and his wife on the platform where Dukakis had
formally accepted the party's presidential nomination moments
before.
   The one-time rivals talked animatedly and then Jackson kissed
Kitty Dukakis.
   Jackson, whose presence has electrified many a hall, slipped
into the Omni unnoticed until Dukakis waved to the civil rights
leader as he sat with former President Jimmy Carter.
   The Massachusetts governor called Jackson ``a man who has lifted
so many hearts with the dignity and the hope of his message
throughout this campaign; a man whose very candidacy says to every
child _ aim high; to every citizen _ you count; to every voter _
you can make a difference; to every American _ you are a full
shareholder in our dream.''
   Jackson and Carter stood together and accepted the cheers of the
crowd.
   Then Dukakis closed his speech by praising Jackson's children,
who had introduced their father to the convention Tuesday night.
   ``What stirred me most on Tuesday were those fine handsome and
proud and articulate Jackson children talking about their hopes for
the future of this country,'' Dukakis said. ``You know, young
Jacqueline Jackson goes to school in Massachusetts. And last month,
she visited with me at the Statehouse in Boston. She's a remarkable
young woman, and I know her parents are very proud of her.''
   Earlier, Jackson had instructed his delegates to back Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas for vice president, despite the tension with
Jackson after Dukakis choose the senator.
   ``The vice presidential nomination is appropriately the choice
of the presidential nominee. While I may disagree with both
Governor Dukakis and Senator Bentsen on some important issues, our
interests converge in building a coalition to beat the Republicans
this fall,'' Jackson said in a statement. ``We Democrats will be
united in the fall in support of the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.''
   ``We will all be represented in the fall campaign councils, and
I will make sure that the progressive agenda remains an integral
part of the Democratic vision,'' Jackson said.
   At the end of the remarkably peaceful and united Democratic
National Convention, Jackson linked arms with Bentsen's wife in a
line with the presidential nominee and his wife to join in signing
the Battle Hymn of the Republic.
   But earlier, he hinted at future retribution against some
Democratic super delegates, saying his supporters ``won elections
in the streets. They lost them in the suites.''
   The Democratic runner-up singled out New York Mayor Ed Koch for
particular criticism, equating his activities in the New York
primary with those of the late Richard Daley in Chicago during the
bloody 1968 convention.
   Jackson, his presidential bid over, met with supporters
throughout the day, thanking them for their efforts and looking
toward the general election against George Bush and the Republicans.
   ``Last night went very well,'' Jackson said. ``It showed
tremendous expansion in our party.''
   Jackson's national campaign chairman, California Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, brushed off suggestions that the Dukakis
campaign was not offering enough spots to Jackson aides.
   ``Jackson's people and Dukakis' people are now one and the
same,'' said Brown as Jackson met with members of the Congressional
Black Caucus.
   But Jackson was angered by not winning states in the delegate
roll call that he had won in the primaries and caucuses.
   ``Those states we won in the primaries, we should have won last
night,'' he told reporters. ``The downside (of the roll call) was
just the revelation of the role that the super delegates played.
This did so much violence to their constituencies.''
   Jackson won 13 states, but had delegate majorities in only four.
He won Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi
and Puerto Rico, but Dukakis had a delegate majority in each.
Jackson won Michigan and Virginia, but the final delegate tally in
each was a tie.
   Jackson was complaining that the super delegates _ more than 600
party and elected officials with automatic seats at the convention
_ did not vote the way of their constituents in the roll call. He
is fond of pointing out that he had the votes of only one state
party chairman and one U.S. senator.
   ``It was not good for people in Virginia, Louisiana and places
like that where the people won and then super delegates imposed
their will upon the people ... They won the elections in the
streets. They lost them in the suites,'' he said.
   Jackson did not name any particular super delegates, but he did
point to Koch as a divisive figure in the 1988 campaign.
   As he praised Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young for his handling of the
convention this year, Jackson told a group of black businessmen:
``We have had mayors who destroyed Democratic conventions or
Democratic primaries. You look at Daley in '68 or Koch in '88.''
   Daley's handling of demonstrators at the 1968 convention led to
bloody confrontations in the streets and political turmoil in the
hall. Koch made pointed criticisms of Jackson in the New York
primary, saying Jewish voters should not back the black candidate
because of his anti-Israel positions.
   But Jackson said he was not talking about retribution.
   ``I would never do a thing like retribution. I do believe in
accountability. I do believe in reciprocity,'' he said.
   In the 13 states and 100 congressional districts he said he won
in the primaries, Jackson said his supporters would be talking to
those super delegates who did not back his candidacy on Wednesday
night.
   ``There will be vigorous activities at the state and
congressional district level for new relationships with
congresspeople, senators and governors,'' he said.
   Jackson said the changes he pushed for in the 1992 party rules
will help his cause, cutting the number of super delegates by a
third.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Overturns Combination Of 35,000 Asbestos Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has overturned a judge's
decision to combine 35,000 asbestos-related lawsuits against a
Chicago company after some of those who filed the suits objected.
   Last month, U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining Jr.
consolidated 35,000 personal injury law suits pending against
Raymark Industries Inc. in response to a defense motion in an
asbestos-related injury claim of an Atlanta couple.
   That decision, which had created one of the largest personal
injury cases and the largest asbestos-related injury case ever, was
overturned by three judges of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   According to federal court records, more than 100 plaintiffs
objected to having their lawsuits against Raymark consolidated into
one complaint because none of them had been notified about legal
efforts that sought the class action. The plaintiffs also
complained that the evidence considered by the federal court was
not enough to justify such a major decision.
   In an order Wednesday, Judge Frank Johnson wrote that the
``District Court's order will delay resolution of their claims
indefinitely.''
   ``The court's order, which essentially moves their cases back to
square one, could hardly place petitioners in a more drastic
predicament,'' wrote Johnson.
   Raymark has been the target of 70,000 personal injury lawsuits
involving 82,000 people in the past 10 years. The suits claim that
people developed asbestos-related diseases after exposure to
insulation and other Raymark products at construction and
shipbuilding sites and factories.
   Half of the 70,000 cases already have been resolved by trial,
out-of-court settlement or dismissal.

   Queen Mother Elizabeth popped in for a quick glass
of beer at a pub during a tour of the Surrey Docks, which she
visited during the World War II bombing of Britain.
   Locals at the Blacksmith's Arms in southeast London were
astonished when Queen Elizabeth II's mother, who turns 88 on Aug.
4, got out of her limousine Thursday and told pub owner Max
Leftwich, ``I would love to have a glass of your beer.''
   Royal bodyguards prevented other visitors from entering the pub
while she drank her brew.
   The queen mother was also shown some of the 5,000 new houses and
apartments that have replaced warehouses and docks in the London
Docklands district.
   Elizabeth, who was queen during the war often visited bombed-out
sections of London with her husband, King George VI. The worst were
in the poor East End.

   William ``The Refrigerator'' Perry, the
huge defensive tackle who helped power the Chicago Bears to the
1986 Super Bowl title, is being treated for an eating disorder, the
team announced.
   The Bears issued a statement after Perry, 25, failed to appear
for the first meeting of summer training camp Thursday.
   ``This is no laughing matter; it is very serious,'' said coach
Mike Ditka, who said Perry weighed 358 pounds a couple of weeks ago.
   ``The Bears are in agreement with Perry that this is a medical
matter and the Bears will have no further comment at this time,''
the statement said. Perry entered a treatment program voluntarily,
the team said.
   ``I have no idea how long he will be out,'' said Ditka.
   Perry, the Bears' No. 1 draft choice out of Clemson University
in 1985, became one of the most publicized _ and heavyweight _
rookies in National Football League history when the Bears went on
to win the Super Bowl.
   Ditka had told Perry to slim down to 330 pounds or be excluded
from summer training camp. The coach said Thursday his ultimatum
had nothing to do with Perry's decision to enter the treatment
program.

   The public will get a preview of pop star Elton
John's ``garage sale,'' in which he plans to sell 2,000 personal
items, including some of his trademark zany costumes and fancy
spectacles.
   The Victoria and Albert Museum here, the state museum of fine
and applied art, will exhibit 500 of the objects Aug. 9-23.
   The exhibition will include art nouveau and art deco furniture,
jewelry and painting by such artists as surrealist Rene Magritte,
as well as designer clothes and bizarre sculpture, ceramics and
glass that caught John's eye in 15 years of collecting.
   All 2,000 items will be auctioned Sept. 6-9 at Sotheby's in
London, which hopes to realize about $5 million from the sale.
Sotheby's is paying the cost of the museum exhibition, said museum
spokesman Graham Wiffen.
   John said in January that he wanted to move from his 10-bedroom
mansion near Windsor to a more rural location in southern England
and that selling some of his art and furniture would enable him to
make changes in his collections.

   New York's loquacious Mayor Edward I.
Koch stopped talking long enough to down a glass of Guinness at one
of Dublin's best-known pubs.
   The mayor made a 15-minute lunchtime stop Thursday at Neary's
Select Bar, where he enjoyed a half-pint of Ireland's most famous
brew and tried his hand at tending bar. He was temporarily stymied
by the lever on the beer keg.
   ``The mayor said he wouldn't make a very good bartender,'' said
David Simpson, Neary's assistant manager. ``But he got it perfect
on the second try.''
   Koch flew in from the Netherlands and spent a whirlwind day in
the Irish capital. Today, he was to join a pilgrimage led by Roman
Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York to promote peace in
Northern Ireland.

<HEAD>Ariane Rocket Soars Into Orbit With European, Indian Payloads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOUROU, French Guiana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European and Indian satellites
soared smoothly into orbit aboard an Ariane-3 rocket that lifted
off from the European Space Agency launch site in the jungle of
French Guiana.
   The rocket was fired without a hitch at 7:12 p.m. EDT Thursday
from the launch pad in Kourou, on the northeastern coast of South
America. It was the 24th launch for Arianespace, the company
responsible for commercial flights of European rockets, and the
fourth this year.
   Cloudy weather at the launch site caused a six-minute delay in
the countdown. Moments after the rocket took off, its brilliant
orange flame was obscured by the low clouds.
   Seventeen minutes after takeoff, the rocket reached the orbiting
altitude of 22,500 miles.
   Within four minutes, the two satellites were launched toward
stationary positions above the earth. They are ECS-5 for Eutelsat,
the European Organization of Satellite Communications, and INSAT-1C
for the Indian Space Research Organization.
   ``We are particularly happy tonight to have successfully
launched the Indian satellite,'' said Frederic d'Allest, director
of Arianespace.
   ``Arianespace has put 11 satellites into orbit in 11 months,''
and the company has additional launches scheduled for September,
October, November and December, he said. Nine launches are set for
1989.
   ``There will be no vacation for Ariane,'' he said, adding that
the rocket to be launched Sept. 7 will carry two more satellites
into orbit.
   Ariane-3 is capable of lifting 2.8 tons into space, compared to
the new generation Ariane-4 rocket which can carry a maximum load
of 4.6 tons. The new, powerful rocket was launched for the first
time June 15 and carried three satellites into orbit. It is
scheduled to blast off again in November.
   The versatile Ariane-4, developed at a cost of $575 million,
will be used with increasing frequency between November and 1991 to
meet Arianespace's backlog of 42 launch orders.
   ECS-5, weighing 2,607 pounds, was constructed jointly by the
French aerospace and defense giant Matra and British Aerospace. The
satellite will upgrade long distance telephone service from
Portugal to Finland and Turkey to Ireland during its seven-year
lifespan.
   Eutelsat, which groups 26 national telecommunications
authorities, had reserved a place on the American Atlas Centaur
rocket in case of setbacks in the Arianespace program.
   On May 31, 1986, technicians were forced to destroy an Ariane-2
rocket shortly after liftoff when a problem in the third-stage
ignition caused the rocket to go off course. Arianespace suspended
launches for 16 months after the failure.
   INSAT-1C, constructed by Ford Aerospace, has a lifespan of 10
years. It will expand television and long-distance telephone
service and collect meteorological data.
   The 2,618-pound satellite was originally to be carried by an
American rocket. But after the failure of the U.S. space shuttle
Challenger, Indian authorities decided to put their valuable cargo
aboard an Ariane under a contract worth $50 million.
   The space shuttle program was grounded after seven astronauts
were killed in the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster.
   A small leak on the launch pad now threatens to delay the
scheduled September launching of the next U.S. space shuttle
mission by as much as two months, U.S. officials said. Space
shuttle Discovery is scheduled to take a crew of five astronauts
into space.
   Before the Thursday launch, Pramod Kale, director of ISRO, said
that for five years telecommunications in India has relied on a
single satellite. The next INSAT satellite is scheduled for
launching in early 1989 aboard an American Delta rocket.
   Kale said that until INSAT-1B was launched in 1983, television
reached only the larger Indian cities. Now, because of satellite
communications, 70 percent of the country's population has access
to television.
   Arianespace now hauls half the world's commercial payloads and
holds launch contracts worth $2.5 billion. Eight launches are
scheduled for 1988, with nine launches a year planned beginning in
1989.

<HEAD>Soybean Market To Remain Volatile Despite Recent Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent thundershowers have helped cool off the
superheated soybean market somewhat, but Agriculture Department
analysts figure there will be enough excitement to go around for a
while anyway.
   Some futures contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade soared to
around $11 per bushel earlier this month as heat and drought
continued to fry 1988 harvest prospects. Rains have since dampened
things a bit, with prices around $8.50 or so per bushel on Thursday.
   The department's Economic Research Service says the soybean
market simply ``has been up to its old tricks _ volatility,
excitement and surprise.'' Historically, soybean trading has kept
everyone on their toes.
   ``In recent years, however, the market has been relatively
subdued,'' says a report in a forthcoming issue of Farmline
magazine. ``In fact, U.S. growers have struggled through a
disappointing period of increased foreign competition, cutbacks in
domestic production and lower prices.''
   But this year, even before the impact of the drought became
obvious, there were big tremors in the soybean market when it
appeared demand might outstrip or come close to eating up the U.S.
stockpile of old-crop beans.
   ``This has been a good year for exports of U.S. oilseeds,
despite record world oilseed production and a significant increase
in South American soybean production,'' the report said.
   Soybean exports, projected at 785 million bushels in 1987-88,
are the highest in five years. Coupled with domestic use, that was
expected to trim U.S. soybean inventories to around 290 million
bushels by the time the new marketing year begins on Sept. 1, down
from 436 million bushels a year ago.
   New projections for 1988-89 showed a further shrinkage in
soybean reserves to less than 150 million bushels by Sept. 1, 1989.
   Domestic demand for soybean meal and sales of soybean oil also
have been heavy.
   ``In this country, soybean use has risen for three straight
years and production has declined the last two years,'' the report
said. ``World inventories have been falling for several years.''
   The United States is still the world leader in the production
and exporting of soybeans, although some of that edge has been lost
in recent years.
   A peak was reached in 1979, when American farmers produced 2.26
billion bushels of soybeans. Output averaged 1.93 billion bushels
during the 1980s.
   Meanwhile, world production of soybeans increased fivefold in
the last 30 years, the report said. Brazil and Argentina have
rapidly expanded since 1970. Between 1980 and 1987, total South
American acreage increased nearly 40 percent to 38.4 million acres,
and production rose 46 percent to 1.04 billion bushels.
   Consequently, the U.S. share of world soybean production dropped
to 56 percent by the mid-1980s from 74 percent in the late 1960s.
   ``The U.S. domination of the world soybean market has eroded
because of South American competition, more foreign production of
tree oils (such as palm oil) and greater oilseed production in
Europe,'' the report said.
   Until this year, the report said, the 1980s ``had not been an
outstanding decade'' for U.S. soybeans, and the outlook is
uncertain.
   The report added: ``World demand for protein meals and vegetable
oils is not increasing fast enough to accommodate more growth in
South American production without further displacing production
from the United States.''

   One police officer was sentenced to life in
prison and five others to terms up to 15 years for torturing to
death a factory chief accused of throwing acid in someone's face,
an official report said today.
   The China Daily said the sentences were handed down by a court
in central China's Henan province in the death of Li Rongcheng, the
head of a factory run by a school in Xinxiang City.
   The report said Li was detained last December as a suspect after
a teacher at the school was splashed in the face with sulfuric acid.
   Wang Weiying, deputy head of the local police department,
instructed and joined the other five in beating Li with an electric
club and torturing him in other ways during 18 hours of
questioning, the newspaper said. Li died after the ordeal.
   An autopsy found that Li was injured on 30 places on his body,
the China Daily said. The autopsy concluded that Li, who had a
heart condition, died of heart failure from physical abuse.
   Wang received a life sentence, while the other five received
sentences ranging from two to 15 years, the newspaper said.
   The torturing of common criminals and those with suspect
political backgrounds was widespread during the ultra-leftist
1966-76 Cultural Revolution, but has since been banned.
   However, Chinese legal officials acknowledge there are still
incidents of police abusing their power, and the official media
occasionally spotlights cases where suspects are tortured by police
or deprived of their legal rights.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is promoting a withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and pursuing a settlement with
China in a policy reversal that could pave the way to a summit
meeting of the two communist superpowers.
   For years, the Soviets took the position that what their ally,
Vietnam, did in Cambodia was Hanoi's responsibility and not
Moscow's. But Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has now seized on
Hanoi's announcement that 50,000 troops would be withdrawn from
Cambodia this year to authorize a high-level Sino-Soviet meeting.
   The talks will center on ending the war in Cambodia and be held
either at the end of this month or in August. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz was informed by Chinese officials in Beijing and
he offered public encouragement Thursday in a speech in Honolulu.
   ``The Soviet Union, as Vietnam's principal supporter, has a
clear responsibility to help bring this tragic conflict to an
end,'' Shultz said. ``Therefore, I have had increasingly frequent
exchanges with the Soviet foreign minister in order to encourage a
constructive stance on their part.''
   Shultz added: ``I am encouraged by the tone and content of these
contacts.''
   The meeting, at the vice premier level, could remove the major
roadblock to a Sino-Soviet summit meeting. Another is being cleared
with the withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan.
   U.S. policy calls for coupling the demand for Vietnam's
withdrawal from Cambodia with support for Prince Sihanouk as,
Shultz said, ``the genuine leader of an independent Cambodian
government.''
   However, the United States may not be able to ensure that the
country does not again fall into the hands of the Khmer Rouge, who
were accused of murdering millions of Cambodians and whose excesses
made it easier for Vietnam to take charge a decade ago.
   Shultz pledged in Hawaii to ``continue to support measures which
could be implemented in the context of a settlement that rejects a
return to control by the Khmer Rouge.''
   The Soviets' switch on Cambodia was presaged by a speech
Gorbachev made in Vladivostok two years ago proposing that China
and Vietnam hold talks on the Vietnamese situation. The speech
hinted at Moscow's interest in an end to Hanoi's military
occupation.
   Beginning next Monday, Cambodian guerrillas, Vietnamese
officials and representatives of the pro-Vietnam government in
Cambodia will meet in Jakarta, Indonesia, to set the stage for the
talks between the Soviet Union and China.
   A serious squabble there could upset prospects for success.
Also, Sihanouk, who resigned this month from the presidency of the
three-party guerrilla coalition, accused Vietnam on Thursday of
being unwilling to conduct serious talks.
   Vietnam moved into Cambodia in 1979. The withdrawal of 50,000 of
the estimated 125,000 Vietnamese troops in the country may be
related to Gorbachev's withdrawal from Afghanistan, his removal of
short and medium-range nuclear weapons from Eastern Europe and
speculation he will pull the Red Army out of Hungary, ending a
32-year occupation.

   Michael Dukakis, accepting the Democratic
presidential nomination as a son of immigrants and product of the
American dream, proclaimed Thursday night that ``the Reagan era is
over and a new era is about to begin.''
   In remarks to the closing session of the Democratic National
Convention, the Massachusetts governor pledged to ``forge a new era
of greatness for America.''
   The nominee was introduced by his cousin, Academy Award winning
actress Olympia Dukakis, who narrated a brief film with scenes from
his life _ including his home in Brookline, Mass., and the
25-year-old snowblower she wheeled out of the garage as an example
of his tightfistedness.
   He opened his speech by recalling the night of the Oscar
ceremonies when Ms. Dukakis raised her Oscar over her head and
said, ``OK, Michael, let's go.''
   The nominee's eyes filled with tears and he bowed his head
briefly when he referred to his late father ``the young man who
arrived at Ellis Island with only $25 in his pocket, but with a
deep and abiding faith in the promise in America.''
   The joyful Democrats who packed the hall cheered lustily when he
told them, ``We're going to win this race.'' Ninety-one times they
interrupted him with cheers and applause.
   At one point when Dukakis said he wanted a vice president ``who
won't sit silently by,'' the delegates began a chant, that had
become one of the themes of the convention: ``Where was George?'' _
a reference to Vice President George Bush.
   For many of the party faithful, it was the first opportunity for
genuine cheers since the Republican era was ushered in by Ronald
Reagan in 1980.
   It was shortly after 11 o`clock when Dukakis finished speaking
and his wife joined him on the podium. They embraced and then Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the vice presidential nominee, and his wife,
B.A., also stepped into the spotlight.
   The podium quickly became a family scene with the children and
parents of both nominees joining them.
   Then in the traditional unity gesture, Jesse Jackson and his
wife, Jacqueline, also stepped to the podium. Following them were
the other Democrats who had lost out to Dukakis in the contest for
the nomination.
   Before Dukakis was introduced, his father-in-law, Harry Ellis
Dickson, associate conductor emeritus of the Boston Pops Orchestra,
conducted ``Fanfare for Michael Dukakis,'' composed for the
occasion by John Williams.
   For Dukakis, the speech marked the culmination of a 16-month
campaign for his party's presidential nomination and the formal
opening of his challenge to Bush.
   After the convention ended, Dukakis, his family and Bentsen and
his wife walked across the street to the Georgia World Congress
Center where they received thunderous applause from thousands of
delegates celebrating at a victory party.
   In the five-minute impromptu remarks, he urged the delegates not
to ease up their support for the ticket, warning, ``This is going
to be a tough, tight, competitive race.''
   Dukakis and Bentsen, will leave the convention city together on
Friday for joint campaign appearances in Texas, California, North
Dakota, Missouri and Pennsylvania.
   The nominee paid tribute to Jackson as a man who has lifted so
many hearts with the dignity and the hope of his message throughout
this campaign; a man whose very candidacy says to every child _ aim
high; to every citizen _ you count; to every voter _ you make a
difference; to every American _ you are full shareholder in our
dream.''
   Jackson gave Dukakis a thumbs-up sign when the nominee waved.
   The speech echoed familiar themes and phrases from his campaign
_ from the call for ``good jobs at good wages'' to the pledge to
wage ``a real war _ not a phony war _ against drugs.''
   In a reference to the scandals of the Reagan administration,
Dukakis said that ``if you accept the privilege of public service,
you had better understand the responsibilities of public service.
   ``If you violate that trust you'll be fired; if you violate the
law you'll be prosecuted; and if you sell arms to the Ayatollah,
don't expect a pardon from the president of the United States.''
   Dukakis switched to Spanish, a language in which he is fluent,
to pay tribute to the late Willie Velasquez, founder of the
Southwest Voter Education Project, which registered thousands of
Hispanics to vote.
   President Reagan came in for praise for his arms control efforts.
   ``He has said that we should judge the Soviet Union not by what
it says but by what it does,'' Dukakis said of the Republican
president. ``And I agree with that.''
   ``We must be _ and we are _ and we will be _ militarily
strong,'' he pledged, in an obvious response to those who criticize
his weak on defense.
   ``We must always be prepared to defend our freedom,'' he said.
``But we must always remember that our greatest strength comes not
from what we possess, but from what we believe; not from what we
have, but from who we are.''
   Watching her son accept the presidential nomination was Euterpe
Dukakis, the nominee's mother who came to the United States from
Greece 75 years ago. His late father also was a Greek immigrant
and, if elected president, Dukakis would be the first son of two
immigrant parents to hold the office since Andrew Jackson.
   ``It's time to rekindle the American spirit of invention and
daring; to exchange voodoo economics for can-do economics; to build
the best America by bringing out the very best in every American,''
said Dukakis.
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis tried out some self-deprecating
humor during a brief appearance at a luncheon sponsored by the
Democratic National Committee and the party's House and Senate
campaign committees.
   ``As all of you know, I'm a stem-winding orator,'' he said.
   He told the assembled group that his wife, Kitty, had asked if
she could look at his acceptance speech, which he had spent much of
the week writing.
   ``I said OK and she went into the bedroom,'' he said. ``When I
went into the room myself to get my jacket, my wife was fast asleep
on the bed and the speech was beside her, half read.''
   In his convention speech, Dukakis said the Democrats would win
``because we are the party that believes in the American dream.
   ``A dream so powerful that no distance of ground, no expanse of
ocean, no barrier of language, no distinction of race or creed or
color can weaken its hold on the human heart.
   ``I know, because I am a product of that dream.''
   Echoing the call for change that has been a fundamental part of
the his campaign, Dukakis said that ``maintaining the status quo _
running in place _ standing still _ isn't good enough for America.
Opportunity for some isn't good enough for America.''
   Touching on another of his campaign themes _ the need for people
to work together _ Dukakis talked about ``the idea of community.''
   ``It is the idea that we are in this together; that regardless
of who we are or where we come from or how much money we have _
each of us counts. And that by working together to create
opportunity and a good life for all _ all of us are enriched _ not
just in economic terms, but as citizens and as human beings.''
   He said that as president he would ``set goals for our country;
not goals for our government working alone; I mean goals for our
people working together.''
   Four years from now, he said he hoped people would ``be proud of
their government; proud of a government that sets high standards
not just for the American people, but high standards for itself.''

<HEAD>White House Still Not Saying Whether It Will Seek Military Contra
Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House is pushing for a
``strong, meaningful, bipartisan package'' of aid to Nicaraguan
rebels, but is stopping short of saying whether the package should
include lethal military assistance.
   ``It is something that we're going to be discussing with the
congressional leadership next week,'' White House chief of staff
Kenneth M. Duberstein said Thursday as he briefed reporters after a
meeting of top presidential aides on foreign and domestic issues.
   He said Reagan, who winds up a weeklong vacation at his ranch
north of Santa Barbara on Sunday, will meet with Republican
congressional leaders on Tuesday.
   Duberstein said Thursday's 3{-hour meeting of 15 of Reagan's top
aides was designed to lay out ``a positive, energetic, active last
six months of his presidency to reinforce the themes of the first
7{ years.''
   Reagan's second term will end Jan. 20.
   ``The staff input today was to go forward on a strong,
meaningful bipartisan package on Contra aid, and it is something
that we will be talking to the leadership about next week,''
Duberstein said.
   The chief of staff did not reply directly, however, when asked
whether the administration would press for lethal as well as
humanitarian assistance.
   ``It is something that we are going to be working with the
Congress to make sure that we can get as much as possible to
support the peace efforts that we have under way,'' he said.
   It was not the first time the administration has struck a note
of reticence as it weighs new approaches for dealing with the
increasingly defiant leftist government of Nicaragua in the wake of
congressional action in February cutting off military aid to the
rebels.
   In a June 18 radio address, the president said the congressional
cutoff of aid was ``a dangerous gamble with our national security''
and added, ``We must work for a free Nicaragua ... but time is
growing short.'' He did not, however, spell out what steps should
be taken.
   On June 29, speaking in support of Republican senatorial
candidate Rep. Connie Mack III in Miami, he said, again without
being specific, ``Connie Mack and I stand with the Nicaraguan
resistance; we will not rest until we have won for them the full
support they need.''
   Then, on July 13, Reagan was asked whether he was going to
request military aid and responded, ``I'm trying to consider ...
whether I should answer that or not. It's almost like giving
something away while we're still at work.'' He never did answer.
   On July 15, the president ducked a question as to whether there
was now a consensus in Congress for lethal aid, saying, ``I'm not
in a position to estimate or make any count of that.''
   In a speech in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell,
the president's national security adviser, said Congress and the
president need to ``come to agreement on a program of effective aid
for the Nicaraguan resistance as an adjunct to our diplomatic
strategy.''
   But Powell did not define ``effective,'' any more than Reagan
said what he meant by ``full support'' or Duberstein by
``meaningful'' assistance.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., has introduced a bill
that would provide for humanitarian assistance and put some lethal
aid in an escrow account to be released if the president certified
it was needed.
   ``We're going to take a look at the Dole package, which we have
generally supported, and talk with others on the hill as far as
getting cosponsors and making sure that it is something that we can
get through the Senate and that will provide for the needs that we
see,'' Duberstein said.

<HEAD>Fish Oil May Help Clear Arteries, Prevent Heart Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A laboratory experiment by two Cleveland
researchers may help to explain why a diet rich in cold-water fish
helps to prevent heart attacks.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, Paul L. Fox
and Paul E. DiCorleto of the Cleveland Clinic Research Institute
report that in test-tube experiments they have shown that oil
extracted from fish that live in cold water will depress production
of a protein called the platelet-derived growth factor.
   Reducing this protein, Fox said in a telephone interview,
suppresses the growth of smooth muscle cells in arteries and, thus,
helps stem the blood-vessel narrowing that can lead to a heart
attack.
   But Fox said the finding does not mean that people should start
popping fish-oil pills as a heart attack preventative. More study
must be done before there is proof that such dietary supplements
can be effective, he said.
   ``I would not personally recommend that people take fish oil,''
Fox said. ``I don't think it's bad for you. But I would recommend a
more prudent diet, which would include eating fish several times a
week.''
   Several studies, including research among Greenland Eskimos and
fishermen in Japan and Holland, have shown that a diet that
includes lots of fish may be responsible for the low incidence of
heart disease among those groups.
   Researchers previously have suggested the reason such diets are
beneficial is that the flesh of cold water fish, such as cod,
halibut and tuna, contains an oil rich in a particular type of
fatty acid.
   But Fox said researchers still aren't sure precisely how the oil
works to prevent heart attack.
   Some researchers have suggested the oils reduce the blood levels
of cholesterol and triglyceride, both of which play a role in the
narrowing of arteries. Others suggest the fish oil changes the
clotting rate in the blood, which helps prevent blockages. Fox said
he and DiCorleto have found still another way in which fish oil may
fight heart disease.
   In test-tube experiments, Fox said his team has found that fish
oil reduces by 50 percent to 85 percent the production of the
platelet-derived growth factor protein. He said similar tests using
peanut oil had no effect on the growth factor production, while
safflower oil was less than 10 percent as effective.
   He said the growth factor protein normally stimulates
proliferation of smooth muscle cells, which line the outside of
arteries. Fox said the growth of these muscle cells is thought to
promote the lesions in the arteries that can lead to blockages, the
basic problem in the heart disease process called atherosclerosis.
   ``We're not sure which of the three suggested mechanisms is
responsible for the beneficial effects of fish oil,'' said Fox.
``Two or all three may play a role. That's often the way it is in
biology.''
   He said the theories need to be tested in humans or animals.
Only then, said Fox, will it be known exactly how fish oil works to
reduce heart attack, and in what form the oil should be taken into
the human diet.
   The oil from cold-water fish is more fluid than oil from beef or
pork and is less likely to produce the solid molecules that can
clog arteries, said Fox. Fish living in deep, cold water are
thought to have developed this oil to help them function in the
chilly depths where they live, he said.

<HEAD>NRC, Nuclear Industry Focus on Substandard Materials in Power
Plants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S.
nuclear industry are undertaking stepped-up efforts to deal with
the use of substandard components in nuclear power plants,
according to NRC officials.
   They told a commission briefing Thursday that although the
problem is serious, it does not appear to pose immediate safety
hazards.
   ``We have a very serious issue before us,'' said NRC Chairman
Lando W. Zech Jr. ``We've just got to get our arms around it and
find out exactly how big the problem is.''
   At issue are components ranging from defective bolts and other
fasteners to used circuit breakers that were falsely labeled as new
and first discovered this spring at a California nuclear power
plant.
   Thomas Murley, the NRC's director of reactor regulation, said
his office has issued special information bulletins to nuclear
plant operators and was cooperating with the agency's office of
investigations.
   Possible changes in NRC regulations are being considered to help
deal with the components problem, he said, but ``it's too early to
tell where that will lead us.''
   Murley said he believes the ``great majority of deficiencies''
in plant equipment will be spotted through regular checks as part
of the NRC's quality assurance program.
   ``Still, we acknowledge that the quality assurance program is
not perfect,'' he said.
   Overall, Murley said, ``our conclusion is that we must continue
to deal with the problem, but there is no immediate safety issue.''
   Victor Stello, the NRC's executive director for operations,
said, ``I am persuaded that the (nuclear) industry now recognizes
that they do indeed have a serious problem.''
   The NRC announced earlier this month that it was investigating
five California companies for their alleged role in supplying used
circuit breakers falsely labeled as new equipment.
   After seizing documents during searches at the companies'
offices, the NRC sent notices July 8 to nuclear plants across the
country.
   The used circuit breakers, which serve the same function as
fuses in shutting off power to prevent short circuits or fires,
were first discovered at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near
San Luis Obispo, Calif., when they failed tests there in April.
   In June, Stello told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
that more than half of the country's 109 nuclear reactors had some
substandard studs and bolts in safety-related locations.
   Stello testified that the problem stemmed from failure to test
crucial steel bolts that suppliers sold to reactor operators as
being resistant to bending under stress.
   Members of the subcommittee asserted that some of the suppliers
may have profited by deliberately marketing weak fasteners falsely
labeled as ``high tensile.''
   According to information supplied by the NRC to the House panel,
utilities operating 66 reactors in 31 states had reported the
presence of bad bolts. Eight to 10 percent of a small sample
surveyed by the utilities last fall at the agency's request were
below required specifications for tensile strength, hardness,
resistance to stretching or chemical composition.

<TEXT>
   U.S. disarmament officials are trying to
mobilize sentiment against chemical and biological weapons by
focusing public attention on the potential danger posed by these
weapons in the hands of terrorists.
   ``I'm not here to terrify people, but I think before the
terrorism is upon us we need to start addressing'' the problem,
Kathleen C. Bailey, assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said Thursday.
   Biological weapons programs are in progress around the world,
but because of secrecy restrictions, ``it is going to take some
time before we can get out to the public to make an issue,'' Ms.
Bailey told an audience at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
policy research group.
   ``The terrorist angle is likely to bring public attention,''
considering the relative ease with which chemical and biological
weapons can be transported without detection, she said.
   ``When you can tell people in New York City or Atlanta, or
wherever, that somebody can walk in with a suitcase ... (that) can
hold things that can kill an awful lot of people in a small area,
such as chemical weapons, or an even larger number of people over a
broader area, biological weapons, you can get some excitement
going.''
   Without identifying countries, Ms. Bailey said the U.S.
government had evidence that in 1972 at least seven countries had
chemical warfare programs and four had germ warfare programs.
Today, this has increased to 20 countries testing chemical weapons
and 10 testing biological weapons, she said.
   The United States is working at the diplomatic level to gain
support for a comprehensive, verifiable ban on chemical weapons far
beyond the existing 1925 Geneva protocol, Ms. Bailey said. ``But I
don't think we're succeeding in bringing the rest of the world
along with us very well. I would like see much more in cooperation
with our allies.''
   More public diplomacy would be useful, she said, and greater
effort is needed ``to raise the level of abhorrence.''

<TEXT>
   The final night of the Democratic National
Convention had at least one thing in common with the first three.
Parties.
   The last night on the party circuit included a large ``Victory
'88'' party at the Georgia World Congress Center, next door to the
convention hall, and planned bashes by the Michael Dukakis-Lloyd
Bentsen and Jesse Jackson campaigns.
   Dukakis and Bentsen received thunderous applause from a crowd of
thousands _ delegates and others who attended or worked at the
convention _ when they walked across the street at the close of the
convention to the ``Victory '88'' party.
   ``This has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a
great Democratic victory in November of 1988,'' Dukakis told the
throng after thanking Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and the city of
Atlanta for hosting the convention.
   Later, he warned his supporters not to ease up their support for
the ticket: ``We're going to need you all. This is going to be a
tough, tight, competitive race.''
   When he completed his five minutes of impromptu remarks, an
orchestra started playing Greek tunes and Dukakis danced two or
three steps, setting off wild cheers.
   Bentsen said the convention had produced ``the most enthusiastic
and united Democratic party that I have ever seen.''
   Earlier in the evening, when convention activities got under way
at The Omni, contributors to the Democratic Party of Georgia
mingled over drinks at a party next door at the Omni Hotel.
   At first, journalists were denied entrance. ``This is private _
you know, for muckety-mucks,'' said Democratic doorkeeper Scott
Sikes.
   But reporters later were admitted, and inside the reception room
were the backbone of any successful political endeavor _ the
non-famous loyalists who give money.
   The contributors watched on giant-screen TV as Georgia high
school bands marched in the convention hall, and they stood up,
drinks held aloft, as Lynda Carter sang the national anthem.
   Just down Marietta Street at the Metroplex rock nightclub,
ticket prices were cut from $10 to $6 for the final night of the
``Alternative '88'' convention. A scheduled appearance by comedian
Pat Paulsen was cancelled, but alternative conventioneers could
hear three rock bands and a political satirist-comic.
   Also planned was an ``Austin to Boston'' party hosted by the
Massachusetts and Texas delegations, which expected appearances by
Dukakis and Bentsen.

Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.D. Hill, a former wide receiver for
the Buffalo Bills and a vocal critic of drug abuse, was arraigned
on felony cocaine possession charges after being caught in a police
sting operation.
   Hill, 39, was arrested last week in Sacramento in a police sting
that netted 25 others, the district attorney's office said. He
remained in custody Thursday in lieu of $8,000 bail.
   The arrests followed a day-long undercover operation in which
plain-clothes officers observed buying and selling of rock cocaine.
   Sgt. Bob Burns, a police department spokesman, said Hill was
arrested after allegedly purchasing a quantity of the drug. Hill
did not enter a plea at his arraignment Thursday and is scheduled
to return to court July 29.
   Hill, who has been involved in several local anti-drug programs
and youth camps, delivered a 1986 eulogy for Cleveland Browns
defensive back Don Rogers, who died of a drug overdose.
   Hill was a wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills from 1971 to
1975, then went to the Detroit Lions, where he played until his
retirement from the National Football League in 1978. Recently, he
was a reporter for a Christian radio station.

   The Air Force has acknowledged that its
initial report on a 1986 radioactive spill at an Ohio military base
was incomplete, but is protesting a proposed fine as unwarranted,
Air Force documents show.
   The documents, released Thursday by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, were prepared by the Air Force in response to a
proposed fine of $102,500 by the NRC in connection with the
incident at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton.
   The NRC said the proposed fine is for willful failure to report
the spill within 24 hours and for the internal exposure of an
individual to the radioactive powder.
   However, the Air Force argued that under the facts of the
incident, the requirements do not clearly mandate a report within
24 hours.
   ``Through a chain of errors, but without any intent to withhold
information or deceive, the subsequent report from the (Air Force)
was neither full nor complete,'' Gary Vest, deputy assistant
secretary of the Air Force, told the NRC. ``In addition, the
reporting regulation itself is ambiguous.''

   The Federal Communications Commission says it
is ``putting the public on notice'' that it will no longer tolerate
pirates who market illegal descrambling devices for backyard
satellite dishes.
   ``We will put them out of business and, if we can, put them in
jail,'' FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said at a news conference
Thursday.
   Patrick said the FCC is sending warning letters to 19 firms that
the FCC believes sell the technology that enables a dish owner to
decode the scrambled signals used by premium program services like
Home Box Office and Showtime.
   Using such illegal devices allows a dish owner to receive the
broadcasts without having to pay the fees charged by the
programmers or the cable firms authorized to retransmit their
signals.
   `` We're putting the public on notice that we will no longer
look the other way,'' Patrick said.

   In rejecting Tunnerman's visa request, State Department deputy
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Thursday that he had abused his
privileges of residence in the United States and therefore is not
welcome in this country.
   Tunnermann and seven Nicaraguan colleagues were expelled from
the United States last week after Sandinista authorities ordered
home eight U.S. diplomats from Managua, including Ambassador
Richard Melton.
   Tunnermann, who served as both ambassador to the United States
and the OAS, denied the charges and said the administration had
exceeded its authority in expelling a diplomat accredited to the
OAS.

   Two pro-abortion nuns have elected to
resign from their order and ``stand with women'' rather than remain
part of a ``patriarchal'' Roman Catholic church.
   ``We aren't nuns anymore,'' said Barbara Ferraro and Patricia
Hussey said Thursday, announcing an end to their long battle with
the Vatican over their right to support abortion.
   ``For us to stand with women, we need to renounce the
differences, privileges and even limitations that are part of
membership in a religious community in a patriarchal church,'' they
said in a resignation letter.
   The two said they will remain in the church.
   Six weeks ago, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur decided to
drop expulsion proceedings against Hussey and Ferraro.
   The two have been at odds with the order since Oct. 7, 1984,
when they and 94 other Catholics, including 22 other nuns and four
priests, signed a statement published in The New York Times saying
there is a diversity of opinion about abortion within the church.
   Catholic leaders threatened the priests and nuns who signed the
statement with dismissal if they didn't recant their statements.
All agreed except for Hussey and Ferraro, whom the church
repeatedly asked for a retraction.
   The Sisters of Notre Dame began dismissal procedures last
January by issuing a formal canonical warning. The nuns, who run a
homeless shelter in Charleston, responded in a letter saying,
``Your demands are really an attempt to silence our consciences and
our public voices on the issue of reproductive rights for women.''
   A second and final warning was issued in February. In June,
however, the 184-year-old order backed down because the action
``would not be in the best interests'' of the order and the
Catholic Church.
   Vatican officials still had the option of disciplining the nuns,
but Ferraro said she and Hussey had not been forced to resign
although the dismissal procedure played a part in their decision to
leave.
   ``The violence of the process used with us by the leadership,
the lack of respect and understanding of our motivation for the
good of the whole church by many in the community are for us
insurmountable barriers to the reconstruction of a positive
covenant relationship,'' the nuns' resignation letter said.
   ``For the first time in four years, we are able to address the
question of our future in the (religious) community in a free and
non-coercive atmosphere,'' they said.
   Sister Catherine Hughes, general moderator of the order, said in
a statement from Rome that she had received word of the nuns'
decision a few days ago.
   ``Sisters Patricia and Barbara have done what the situation and
their own integrity demanded,'' Hughes said. ``They know that the
prayers of the Sisters of Notre Dame will follow them into the
future.''
   Ferraro and Hussey said they will continue to run Covenant
House, a homeless shelter, and continue to be active in pro-choice
groups.

<HEAD>Republicans Spend Week Sounding Themes That Will Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican ``truth squads'' spent the week trying
hard to rain on the Democrats' convention parade, but they also
began to spell out themes that will become grindingly familiar by
November.
   ``To the extent they have some staying power, I think you will
hear them again,'' said Rich Galen, a spokesman for the National
Republican Congressional Committee.
   Beginning last Friday with Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole,
the GOP flew in party officials each day to criticize the Michael
Dukakis-Lloyd Bentsen ticket.
   Dukakis sought all week to reach out to moderate and
conservative Democrats by picking Bentsen and insisting on a
platform that was deliberately brief.
   The Republicans, however, tried to link him with Jesse Jackson
and attacked ``deception'' in the platform. Their goal was to tag
Dukakis with a liberal label, or ``the `L' word'' as one described
it.
   ``You don't have to be a political genius to figure out that the
Republicans will want to make that point,'' Galen said. ``You don't
have to be a genius to point at that Mike Dukakis is a proud
liberal.
   ``You want to force him back to his home base,'' he said. ``The
overall strategy was to set that out as a framework.''
   In their final session on Thursday, however, a panel of GOP
officials broadened the assault, and claimed a ``Democratic sleaze
factor'' has effectively defused ethical questions which have long
swirled around the Reagan administration, most recently around
Attorney General Edwin Meese.
   They noted there's been almost no rhetoric about Meese during
the week, though Democrats had badly wanted to make him a campaign
issue.
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., said Democrats were embarrassed
by House Speaker Jim Wright's role in presiding over the convention
despite ethical questions which have been raised about him.
   ``I think they have felt uncomfortable talking about sleaze when
the camera right over the shoulder of the speaker focuses on Jim
Wright,'' said Vander Jagt.
   Mike McCurry, spokesman for the Democratic convention, said the
Democrats have steered away from highlighting Meese's problems
because ``we felt in was important to stay focused on delivering a
positive message about what Democrats would do.''
   The Republicans also worked hard to emphasize divisions on the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. Vander Jagt argued that Dukakis seemed like
a moderate during the primaries only because he was running against
Jesse Jackson.
   With the more conservative Bentsen at his side, Vander Jagt
said, voters will begin to view Dukakis as a liberal.

   The crowd gathers slowly at first on the street
corner of the ``media village'' at the Democratic convention.
   The goods are shown.
   The price is set.
   The deal is going down.
   In swoops the Georgia State Patrol.
   They join the dealers, take out their collections of souvenir
lapel pins and start to trade.
   ``I want an NBC peacock,'' said Trooper A.J. Bacon, holding a
piece of cardboard containing his collection.
   Some, including a set of captain's bars and other police uniform
decorations, were for trade. Others were just to show off.
   About 50 people were gathered in small knots that looked like
the trading pit on the floor of a commodity exchange. This exchange
was at the corner of John F. Kennedy Blvd. and Lyndon B. Johnson
Ave. in the cable-strewn, curtain-draped press center across the
street from The Omni convention hall.
   ``We started with one button (Kodak), now we got 100-150. It
just gets wild around here,'' said Trooper Bob Sanders.
   He said button trading was a good ice-breaker for the police and
news people to get acquainted. But the rule was buyer beware: some
pins were better than others.
   ``I'll give you three for that one,'' said one fellow who
strolled up, pointing to square button that said ``CBS News 1988.''
   ``CBS News is not moving,'' Sanders replied.
   ``I'll give you my first-born for it,'' said the newsman.
   Another CBS pin _ a simple, unblinking brass eye _ also was hot.
So was the Time magazine pin, a red-and-blue rectangle that
resembles the magazine's cover except it doesn't say ``Time.''
   The Associated Press had flooded the market with its corporate
pins, and so had Gannett.
   ``They're fourth-rate,'' said Noel Villers, a 14-year-old pin
shark from Concord, Mass.
   Not everything was for swapping.
   When a reporter asked Sanders what he would take for his badge,
the trooper replied: ``When that goes, I have to go with it.''

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
is likely to find that Jesse Jackson's political blessings are not
always unmixed.
   Jackson can be a difficult ally despite his pledges of support
at the Democratic National Convention. He showed that four years
ago, when it took public coaxing to persuade him to campaign for
the ticket.
   For Jackson, campaigning is a permanent work in progress. Even
as he promised to work for the ticket, he said: ``Our charge today
is to learn well the lessons from this campaign and build upon it
as the vision for the next campaign.''
   As the Atlanta convention ended, the most formidable black
presidential candidate in history stood with Dukakis and vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, winners and losers together in
the traditional show of unity.
   So he had stood four years before, with Walter F. Mondale. Then,
as now, Jackson told the convention he would support its nominee.
It took him a while.
   After the cheering was over, Jackson said he wasn't satisfied
with the role and status the Mondale organization had given him and
his supporters. It took six weeks and a post-convention
reconciliation conference to produce his unqualified endorsement
and set him to work, campaigning for his cause and for the ticket.
   In 1984, Mondale promised that black Democrats would have key
roles in his campaign and in the party hierarchy. Jackson said he
wanted more specific commitments. Jackson also said he wasn't
looking for a job or a title for himself _ a statement he has
repeated in Atlanta.
   After the Democrats broke camp in San Francisco four years ago,
Jackson broke ranks. He said the Mondale campaign had no strategy
and no themes to win the black vote. He said there were not enough
blacks or other minorities on the campaign staff.
   Mondale showed his irritation, remarking that he had appointed a
Jackson adviser as a deputy director of his campaign and even that
didn't help.
   Jackson kept saying he wanted to support the ticket, but had to
do so ``with integrity and self-respect, and I must be able to
convey a message of hope to the people I represent.''
   Those themes, too, became familiar in Atlanta.
   Jackson said he certainly will work for the ticket, ``But in
some sense the relationship I will have with the campaign must be
defined by Gov. Dukakis.''
   Dukakis has been defining it all week with praise for Jackson
and with assurances of roles for him and his allies.
   In his acceptance speech, Dukakis praised Jackson as ``a man
whose very candidacy says to every child _ aim high; to every
citizen _ you count; to every voter _ you can make a difference; to
every American _ you are a full shareholder in the American dream.''
   So far, Jackson has responded in kind. ``While I may disagree
with both Gov. Dukakis and Sen. Bentsen on some important issues,
our interests converge in building a coalition to beat the
Republicans this fall,'' he said Thursday night. ``We will all be
represented in the fall campaign councils, and I will make sure
that the progressive agenda remains an integral part of the
Democratic vision.''
   Dukakis held his summit with Jackson the day the Atlanta
convention opened, met with him during the week, and has kept their
staffs in frequent contact.
   Jackson won a promise of a dozen new seats for his supporters
when the Democratic National Committee meets today. There is to be
a vice chairman for minority voter registration. He won a change in
party rules, to tie future delegate apportionment more directly to
primary election results. He got some of what he wanted in the
party platform.
   That's not bad for the loser, but there could be more on his
list. Jackson was meeting today with his delegates and supporters
to take stock and look ahead. He will be launching a political
action committee to raise funds and work for minority candidates,
in voter registration and, in waiting, for the next Jackson
campaign.
   While Dukakis has worked at unity and conciliation, he also has
indicated that there are limits, and that he is not yielding the
party command he won with the nomination.
   He needs Jackson, but not at any price. Dukakis is not in
Mondale's position. Four years ago, the Democratic ticket trailed
hopelessly behind Reagan. Dukakis is dealing from strength; he
leads in early polls.
   Republicans already are claiming Dukakis has made Jackson a
Democratic boss. One GOP spokesman, Gov. James Thompson of
Illinois, said Dukakis made Jackson ``his partner'' and gave him at
least as much clout as Bentsen will have. It's all part of the
Republican effort to depict Dukakis as a liberal in centrist
disguise.
   Any renewal of the 1984 scenario would play into that GOP
strategy. Dukakis won't let it happen.

<HEAD>GOP Might Get Less Coverage After Democrats' Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democrats put on a slickly produced,
prime-time ``miniseries'' for the networks, but succeeded so well
that the networks are considering cutting back on future convention
coverage.
   ABC News President Roone Arledge even suggested Thursday that
his network would cut back on coverage for the Republican National
Convention in August.
   ``If you keep the conventions in this form, obviously it's not
attracting anybody to the process,'' said Arledge. ``It's driving
people at home not to watch, to find something else rather than
watch the political process. It's not healthy for the country.''
   NBC and CBS said they would give the same coverage to the GOP as
they did to the Democrats.
   CBS even added an hour to its coverage of the closing session of
the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night, beginning at
8 p.m. EDT instead of 9. CBS viewers therefore got to see one of
the better speeches, the vibrant and stirring seconding speech for
Lloyd Bentsen delivered by former Rep. Barbara Jordan, speaking
from her wheelchair. NBC and ABC joined in mid-speech.
   CBS declined to run a campaign film on Michael Dukakis that the
other networks carried, filling in instead with commentary and a
commercial.
   There was controversy at the 1984 GOP convention when NBC was
the only network to carry an 18-minute film produced by President
Reagan's re-election campaign.
   The six-minute Dukakis film was narrated by his cousin,
Oscar-winning actress Olympia Dukakis, who introduced him on the
podium.
   ABC said it ran the Dukakis film because it was short. NBC and
CNN ran the Dukakis film as just another part of the proceedings.
   Thursday night's concluding session was Dukakis' show, and after
three days of prime-time coverage of the well-orchestrated, and
therefore mostly dull convention, the networks just let it play out
on Thursday.
   The ratings for this year's Democratic convention have been
running about 10 percent lower than the ratings for the 1984
convention. The networks carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of the
conventions until 1984, but ratings have been in a decline since
1976. That's due in part to the primary system eliminating the
drama of the nomination conventions, but also the proliferation of
video and cable providing other viewing options.
   In order to avoid unsightly conflict, the Democrats even
scripted their convention down to the minute to eliminate
controversy and get favored players prime-time exposure.
   Earlier this year, the networks were excited by the prospect of
contested nominations in both parties, and the idea of returning to
gavel-to-gavel coverage was even discussed. But by the time the
Democrats arrived in Atlanta, Michael Dukakis had even selected a
running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen. The only real high point of
the four nights of prime-time coverage came late on Tuesday when
Jesse Jackson delivered his speech.
   Arledge, who has been most outspoken about the generally
lackluster event, said his network's coverage, including two hours
a night of prime time, ``might be less in '92, if the situation
were identical. It might be less at the Republican convention.
Depends on what they do,'' Arledge said.
   Vice President George Bush has enough delegates for the GOP
nomination. He has not selected a running mate yet, though.
   NBC News President Lawrence K. Grossman said NBC would not cut
back on the GOP out of fairness after giving so much prime time
exposure to the Democrats, but would reassess the amount of
coverage in 1992.
   ``On a basic editorial judgment we would be hard put not to go
to an hour special a night summarizing the convention in New
Orleans, except for the fundamental issues of fairness and
balance,'' Grossman said.
   The networks are not constrained by law to give equal time
because the conventions are considered news events.
   CBS News President Howard Stringer argued that since it's
summer, most viewers would just get reruns on the networks, anyway.
He wouldn't speculate on 1992, but said the prospect of doing
prime-time coverage remains ``attractive.''
   ``This is a moment, perhaps the only moment, and there are four
days of it, when the American people can get to know the political
leaders,'' he said. ``Otherwise it's a minute-twenty and sound
bites.''
   ``There's always going to be an audience for the process of
selecting the leadership of the country,'' said CBS anchor Dan
Rather. ``On any given night, it's not going to be as big as the
audience for whatever inane sitcom is on, but some network news
department is going to cover. Bank it, bet it, if nobody else does,
CBS News is going to do it.''
   Former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, who has been covering
conventions since 1952, agrees they have become less functional.
   ``We are in the position of covering a staged entertainment, and
it turns out the parties are not nearly as good at that as they are
at politics,'' he said.
   But he said he did not favor cutting coverage. ``I think it's a
shame the public is not more attentive to these proceedings. The
mere gathering of these people in one hall is, I think, fascinating
unto itself.''

   Actress Olympia Dukakis gave America a glimpse of
the life and times of her cousin Michael, narrating a folksy video
that ranged from the presidential nominee's immigrant roots to his
tomato plants.
   ``Michael and I have been fortunate, but we're not unique.
Millions of Americans have worked hard to realize their dreams.
Extending these opportunities to everyone is what Mike's all
about,'' the Oscar-winning actress said Thursday night during her
introduction of Dukakis at the finale of the Democratic National
Convention.
   ``We all know that many Americans have come to this country with
nothing, nothing but hope. Well, today one of their sons stands
before you with the opportunity to be president of the United
States.''
   In a pre-recorded video played for the convention and TV
audience, Miss Dukakis stood at the Dukakis family's suburban home
in Brookline, Mass., showing off the tomato plants and ``where he
comes on his day off to cut the grass. Mike, it needs it.''
   Playing on the Massachusetts governor's well-known reputation
for frugality, Miss Dukakis displayed a 25-year-old snowblower.
   ``Mike says it works as well as it did on the day he bought it.
John, his son, says it's as old as his two sisters. I say Mike
gives the word frugal new dimension.''
   The nominee's cousin also took viewers back to Dukakis' high
school, describing a sports-loving youth who excelled at baseball,
basketball, tennis and cross-country and ``used to listen to the
Red Sox on the radio (and) figure out batting averages.''
   ``Michael went away to college planning to follow in his
father's footsteps and become a physician, but he soon discovered
his own interests in politics and government,'' she said. ``He was
inspired by John F. Kennedy. So in 1960, after the Army, he went to
the Democratic Convention. Soon afterwards, he decided to run for
office.''
   Miss Dukakis spoke of her father and uncle who came from Greece
in search of the American dream.
   ``They had no money. They didn't know the language. What they
had were dreams, a commitment to realize them and a willingness to
make sacrifices for their children.''

   The Democratic National Committee is expanding
its membership and officers to make room for more Jesse Jackson
supporters, a key provision of the unity agreement between Jackson
and party nominee Michael Dukakis.
   The deal between Dukakis and Jackson, announced on Monday, ended
tensions between the two camps and cleared the way for the peaceful
and united Democratic National Convention that ended its four-day
run here Thursday night.
   The changes in the national party's structure are intended to
meet the presidential runner-up's demand that the DNC be more
reflective of the rank and file.
   DNC chairman Paul Kirk said he was backing the changes ``in
order to give real meaning to the politics of inclusion and
expansion ... building on the important efforts that Rev. Jackson
has made to expand the party's base.''
   The two most important changes up for DNC approval today would
add a fourth vice chairman and eight new at-large members to the
panel.
   The new vice chairman will be designated to head the party's
voter registration and mobilization efforts _ a focus of Jackson's
efforts for many years. The current three spots traditionally go to
a woman, a black and a Hispanic.
   The new at-large seats boost that group to 33, all of whom are
nominated by the chairman. Jackson convention manager Ron Brown
said this week that Jackson would get roughly half the new at-large
seats.
   All these changes have to be written into the party's charter,
requiring a two-thirds vote of the full committee.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
begins his race against Republican George Bush with a 12-point
advantage, according to an ABC News poll.
   The network reported Thursday that Dukakis leaped to a 53-41
percent lead in a survey of 450 registered voters Wednesday, up
from his 45-46 virtual dead heat with Bush in ABC's poll Sunday.
The movement was 13 points _ from 1 point down to 12 up.
   The jump was expected; polls in other elections have found that
nominees often gain support immediately after their party's
convention. Such bumps frequently settle back down as voters focus
on the substance of the race.
   The survey reflected the success of Dukakis' peacemaking with
Jesse Jackson, his opponent for the nomination. Sixty-eight percent
said Dukakis was treating Jackson fairly, up from 52 percent in a
poll early this month.
   Similarly, 70 percent said Jackson was treating Dukakis fairly,
and the share of respondents with an unfavorable view of Jackson
fell 11 points from Sunday, to 31 percent. Those with a favorable
view rose 9 points to 52.
   The national survey found a rise in unfavorable views of Bush,
who was roundly criticized by convention speakers this week. His
favorable rating fell from 49 percent to 41 percent, while those
viewing him unfavorably rose from 36 percent Sunday to 44 percent
Wednesday.
   The poll, completed the day before Dukakis appeared at the
convention, found little change in his favorable-unfavorable
rating, 55-21.
   Dukakis' 12-point lead against Bush did not mark his greatest
numerical advantage in an ABC poll; the Massachusetts governor led
by 53-40 in late May.
   The margin of error for the new poll was 5 points.
   Such single-day surveys, particularly when conducted during or
just after a highly publicized event, tend to measure visceral
reactions rther than considered opinion, so the views they gauge
can change rapidly.
   Dukakis continued to do better with women voters than with men,
and the poll Wednesday found that he had gained more ground among
women _ leading Bush by 25 points in the new poll, up from an
8-point lead Sunday. Dukakis scored a tie with Bush among men,
after a 12-point Bush lead Sunday.
   Dukakis improved with independents, scoring 48-42 against Bush
after a 52-35 lead for Bush among independents Sunday. And 59
percent of Democrats who had bolted the party to vote for President
Reagan favored Dukakis now.
   In another measure of the convention's impact, 52 percent said
the Democrats could be trusted to do a better job with the nation's
problems, up 9 points from Sunday. And 40 percent said they
generally approved of the proceedings in Atlanta, while just 13
percent disapproved.
   Nearly half said they had not been paying enough attention to
say.

   Harry Ellis Dickson, a renowned conductor and
father-in-law of Michael Dukakis, led the Democratic convention
orchestra in a new musical fanfare composed by Boston Pops
conductor John Williams as a dramatic prelude to the nominee's
acceptance speech.
   Dickson, 79, associate conductor laureate of the Boston Pops
Orchestra and father of Dukakis' wife, Kitty, said he was
apprehensive before the Thursday night premiere of ``Fanfare for
Michael.''
   ``I'm basically a pessimist,'' he said in an interview before
the three-minute work was performed for the delegates and a
national television audience. ``I keep thinking the worst things in
the world. I keep thinking I'll wake up in a few hours and find out
that it's all a dream.''
   Dickson, a violinist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for a
half-century, said he has the same apprehensions about the Dukakis
campaign.
   ``I facetiously asked Mike last week, `Mike, I've been telling
people that my dream is to conduct the (presidential) inaugural
concert. Do you mind if I write to George Bush and ask him if he's
elected, can I still conduct?' Mike laughed and said, `I wouldn't
do it yet.'''
   Dickson, who still conducts the Boston Pops on a part-time
basis, said the new work was conceived several weeks ago, when he
jokingly asked his friend Williams to write a fanfare for his
son-in-law's nomination. Williams immediately agreed.
   The Oscar-winning composer, who took over the Boston Pops from
the late Arthur Fiedler in 1980, is ``a great fan of Michael's,''
Dickson said.
   Williams said from Los Angeles: ``It's a ceremonial piece
introducing Gov. Dukakis. I hope it's suitably celebratory and
magisterial and in the spirit to match the moment.''
   ``It's a very dignified, stirring fanfare ... with a sort of
pompous beginning, but it has a nice middle part for strings and
woodwinds and then it finishes with the whole orchestra,'' Dickson
said.
   Dickson said the convention appearance reminds him of another
personal performance.
   ``When Kitty graduated from high school, her class came to a
pops concert in Boston that I was conducting,'' he said. ``We found
a piece ... called `The Waltzing Cat.' We had a big sign put up
that said, `The Waltzing Kitty.' I think that was about as personal
as you could ever get. I was going to bring it here, but then I
thought, better not.''

<HEAD>Cast As Conservative, Bentsen Celebrates Differences</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen, cast in the role of
conservative on the new Democratic ticket, has decided not to bury
his differences with the more liberal Michael Dukakis, but to
praise them.
   Before millions of Americans who watched Thursday's convention
on prime-time television, the Texas senator served notice that he
does not believe Democrats must ``march in lockstep'' to win the
White House.
   His speech was not as dynamic as that of the presidential
nominee, and it did not rouse the crowd to the heights attained by
Dukakis' oratory. But Bentsen had his own way of telling his party
he balances the ticket nicely:
   Democrats, he said, ``are not gray grains of oatmeal in a bland
porridge of privilege ... We have differences of opinion. But on
the basic issues of justice and opportunity, we stand united.''
   If the party does not expect great things of Bentsen's rhetoric,
it does expect great things of him in November. The senator, whose
name has been described as ``magic'' in the state of Texas, was
picked for the ticket to win his home state, and its 29 electoral
votes, for the Democrats.
   The Dukakis-Bentsen camp has also made it clear Bentsen will
spend a good deal of time in the South, which has been Reagan-Bush
territory of late.
   Bentsen and his aides have stressed those issues on which he and
Dukakis agree: economic growth, jobs creation, women's rights and
better housing, health care and education for all citizens.
   But Bentsen is more conservative than Dukakis and many Democrats
on many issues, including his support of school prayer, the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua and his opposition to gun control.
   Still, the quiet-spoken senator, who has a vaguely patrician
air, had plenty of supporters Thursday night.
   Dukakis, in his own remarks, paid tribute to Bentsen, saying he
would speak up if the National Security Council came up with the
``cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for
hostages.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who nominated Bentsen and works
with him closely on Capitol Hill, called him ``straightforward ...
smart ... and tough.''
   ``He is a sensible, reasonable, rational, common-sense good
choice for vice president of the United States,'' said former Rep.
Barbara Jordan of Texas. ``I believe that he is the best choice you
could come up with to give us a strong and winning ticket this
November.''
   Bentsen also won praise from Jesse Jackson for his longtime
support of civil rights. On Thursday, just as Bentsen's name was
being entered in nomination, Jackson issued a written endorsement
of the senator.
   ``While I may disagree with both Governor Dukakis and Senator
Bentsen on some important issues, our interests converge in
building a coalition to beat the Republicans this fall,'' Jackson
said.
   Still, when the voice vote was taken to acclaim Bentsen the
nominee, many Jackson supporters shouted ``no,'' voicing their
continued displeasure at the absence of their candidate on the
ticket. Fifteen members of Bentsen's Texas delegation refused to
join in the celebration. Signs reading ``No Contra aid'' were
sprinkled through the convention hall.
   Bentsen's own speech drew loud and sustained applause only when
he mentioned Dukakis, but the senator was unruffled.
   ``Just wonderful, really excited,'' he beamed as he left the
podium with Dukakis to attend a round of post-convention parties.

   Demonstrators protesting the
reported detention of a union activist burned nine vehicles in
downtown San Salvador after police fired tear gas and warning shots
to disperse a protest march.
   The protesters, including students and members of a leftist
labor federation, also chanted slogans against proposed state of
emergency legislation and demanded more government spending on
education.
   About 5,000 people marched from the National University through
the downtown district to the headquarters of the Treasury Police in
eastern San Salvador in the demonstration Thursday.
   They said security forces detained Eliseo Cordoba, a social
security worker and union activist, on July 12 and Treasury Police
were holding him. The government has not confirmed the arrest.
   Many marchers wore bandannas and carried nail-tipped wooden
clubs or staves. A line of riot officers backed by police with
assault rifles confronted them.
   Stones were thrown or fired from slingshots, and police fired
more than 100 shots into the air. Demonstrators fled and several
were trampled.
   Some of the marchers regrouped and went to the downtown
district, where they burned the vehicles, some of which had
government license plates.
   The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte has proposed
legislation that would permit public utilities to be put under
military control if their workers went on strike.
   Emergency legislation has been passed periodically since the
civil war with leftist guerrillas began in in October 1979,
sometimes giving the military wide powers of search, seizure and
arrest.
   Human rights groups estimate more than 65,000 people, most of
them civilians, have been killed during the war.

   Abu Nidal's Palestinian terrorist group
denied accusations that it staged the attack on a Greek cruise ship
that left nine people dead and 98 wounded.
   A statement Thursday from Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary
Council said the man named by Greek police as the leader of the
July 11 terrorist raid on the liner City of Poros has been dead
since 1985.
   ``In light of the American allegations that charged our movement
with what happened to the Greek ship ... and what was attributed to
the Greek security minister, I assert that our group has no
connection with this incident,'' said the statement signed by Atef
Abu Bakr, official spokesman for the group.
   ``I also declare that Khadar Samir Mohammed, whose name has been
mentioned, gained the honor of martyrdom in 1985 and this was
officially reported at the time,'' the statement said. It did not
say where or how he died.
   Anastassios Sehiotis, Greek public order minister, said
Wednesday that Hejab Jaballa, whom he accused of leading the
attack, was actually Mohammed. Greek police said the fingerprints
of the two were identical.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, has been blamed
for many terrorist attacks, including those on the Rome and Vienna
airports in December 1985 in which 22 people were killed and more
than 80 wounded.

   Firefighter Tim Moyles tried to
save a home but wound up on a hot seat _ literally _ when his
pumper truck roared out from beneath a firestorm.
   ``I've never felt anything like it. I've never been that hot,''
Moyles said Thursday as firefighters got the upper hand on twin
blazes that have burned 12,500 acres in rural Calaveras County.
Crews hope to contain them tonight.
   Moyles, 27, and three other members of a California Department
of Forestry pumper truck crew sped out of a crashing wave of flame
that swallowed a home near this old gold-mining town, 150 miles
east of San Francisco.
   Moyles jumped on the open back of the truck and pulled a
heat-resistant blanket over himself, but the oven-like temperatures
melted the vinyl seat under him into lumpy rivulets surrounded by
blisters.
   ``When you pull the cover over, you can't see anything, I didn't
know what was happening,'' he said. ``My main concern was just to
make sure I didn't fall off the back of the truck.''
   Arson is suspected as the cause of the blazes that began Tuesday
and have razed six houses. Authorities estimate losses and the cost
of fighting the fires at $4.3 million.
   In Wyoming, firefighters made progress on a wildfire covering
more than 17,000 acres in the Bridger-Teton National Forest and
crews in Oregon fought a 150-acre blaze out of control in the
Umatilla National Forest.
   The Calaveras flare-up was typical for this summer's fast-moving
blazes that have thrown flaming debris far ahead of them in rugged
drought-parched terrain thick with timber and brush.
   Moyles and Dan Miller, the 34-year-old captain of CDF Engine No.
4481 of Valley Springs, were chasing spot fires on a ridge when
they saw gas ignite from a propane tank next to the home a
quarter-mile away. A pumper crewed by volunteers fled, out of water.
   ``I saw the structure was still standing, so we went down to
save it,'' said Miller, who lives in Angels Camp. ``But just after
we got there, the house exploded into flames.''
   ``The wind shifted and the fire blew down on us,'' he added.
   Miller shouted at his crew to board, and they roared down the
road as ``the wind turned the flames into a furnace,'' said Moyles.
   ``We were a little concerned about Tim on the back (on the
truck),'' but Moyles was unhurt when they pulled over a few hundred
yards away at a wide spot in the road, Miller said.
   ``If we had stalled, we'd have lost the engine,'' he said. ``I
thought we would have real burn damage to the engine, but I guess
we didn't stay long enough.''
   ``A couple of engines have gotten so hot the (insignia) seals
and paint have peeled,'' he said.
   Russ Hasemeier, 22, the third member of the crew, jumped into
the cab with Miller.
   ``I never guessed a structure could go up like that,'' Hasemeier
said.
   The crew took refuge in a large barren area cleared by a
bulldozer. The firefighters waited while the fires swept past,
feeling safe by comparison with their earlier scrape.
   When Miller got on the radio, word of the escape spread like
wildfire. ``When something goes out on the air, everybody finds
out,'' he said.
   The fourth member of the crew, who was off when the fire started
Tuesday and has since joined his comrades, was disappointed.
   ``I missed all the real good fireworks,'' Frederick Lewis said.

<HEAD>Soviets Take Lead In Defending Afghan Capital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A series of Afghan rebel victories
and a steady barrage of rocket attacks on the Afghan capital have
led Soviet troops to take the lead in defending Kabul, Western
diplomats say.
   The Soviet move raises new doubts that President Najib's Marxist
government can survive after Moscow withdraws its more than 100,000
troops from Afghanistan, the diplomats said Thursday.
   The rocket strikes this week suggest rebel supplies have
improved and their commanders around the city are better
coordinated, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   They quoted one unconfirmed report as saying 4,000 Afghan
guerrillas have massed on the western edge of the capital and said
fighting was reported on all fronts around Kabul.
   Soviet forces already provide most of Kabul's air and artillery
defense, but Soviet troops now are moving to the capital's
perimeter to battle rebels, the diplomats said.
   They said Soviet troops were sent to Kargha, three miles west of
Kabul, after Afghan troops suffered setbacks. They gave no details.
   The Soviet and Afghan governments maintain that the withdrawing
Soviets are letting Afghan troops take the lead in fighting the
civil war.
   Red Army troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
government fight U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. The Soviet Union
agreed in April to withdraw its troops, and the withdrawal began in
May.
   Rockets blasted the capital Tuesday and Wednesday. Official
Radio Kabul reported 15 people killed Tuesday, and diplomats put
the toll at 17. Casualty figures for Wednesday's attack were not
provided.
   Radio Kabul quoted Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency as
saying shells hit residential areas of the country's eastern city
of Jalalabad Thursday. The broadcast said five people were killed.
   Official Soviet and Afghan media blame the rocket attacks on
Afghan guerrillas.
   Abdul Haq, believed to be the strongest guerrilla commander in
the capital area, said residential areas are not targeted, but
acknowledged some rockets go astray.
   Haq also said Soviet and Afghan forces were rocketing the
capital in an effort to discredit the rebels and turn the
population against them.
   Since the Soviet pullout started, Radio Kabul says almost 200
rockets have slammed into Afghan cities.
   Elsewhere in Afghanistan, 12 guerrillas and a Norwegian relief
worker were killed Wednesday night when their vehicle hit a mine
close to the Pakistan border, the Norwegian news agency NTB
reported Thursday in Oslo.
   Under the U.N.-brokered troop withdrawal accord, half of the Red
Army troops are to be gone by Aug. 15, and complete withdrawal is
scheduled by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Full Soviet withdrawal would leave about 50,000 government
troops fighting an estimated 200,000 rebels.

<HEAD>Wedtech Prosecution, Defense Agree: Meese Is A `Sleaze'</HEAD>

   Both sides in the Wedtech corruption trial found
a rare point of agreement when a federal prosecutor shocked the
courtroom by calling his boss, outgoing U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese, ``a sleaze.''
   The Justice Department response Thursday was swift and angry in
calling for an in-house investigation. Meese's lawyer branded the
remark as ``beneath contempt.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. Little stunned spectators at
the racketeering trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others
Thursday when he brought up the sleaze factor, adding in effect,
that it didn't matter.
   ``These defendants can't get out of this case by pointing
fingers at Meese. So what? Who cares? That's got nothing to do with
what happened in this courtroom,'' said Little.
   Biaggi and his co-defendants are charged with turning Wedtech
Corp., a now-bankrupt defense contractor, into a racketeering
enterprise that paid millions of dollars in bribes for government
contracts and other favors.
   The defense has maintained during the four-month trial that
corrupt Wedtech executives who testified for the government had
links to White House insiders like Meese and did not need to bribe
Biaggi.
   The soft-spoken Little said the answer to ``this Meese defense''
was, ``Meese was a sleaze, too, also, in addition to these
people.'' He also denied defense hints that prosecutors were
shielding ``Ed Meese, our boss.''
   Little's remarks came near the end of his final argument to the
federal jury in Manhattan.
   Dominic Amorosa, the first defense attorney to sum up, said he
was glad the government ``has conceded what we have been saying:
Meese is a sleaze, indeed he is and indeed he was.''
   Final defense arguments were expected to continue into next week.
   Meese attorney Nathan Lewin said Little's comment was ``beneath
contempt. It's ridiculous to make a statement like that. To _ even
as a matter of prosecution strategy _ group the attorney general
with these people is beneath contempt.''
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said,
``We have asked the U.S. attorney's office in New York to check to
see whether Mr. Little is quoted accurately. If such remarks were
made, we would consider them to be inappropriate, unprofessional
and, not least, flatly wrong.''
   Korten declined to comment on whether Little might be subject to
disciplinary action, saying, ``The first thing we want to do is
determine precisely what he said.''
   Meese has been under scrutiny for some time because of his
Wedtech connections, but a special prosecutor in Washington, James
C. McKay, determined there was insufficient evidence to charge
Meese with wrongdoing. However, McKay questioned the attorney
general's ethics on several issues.
   Meese, claiming he was vindicated by the McKay report, has
announced he will leave office later this summer.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley denied a defense
request during the trial to call Meese as a witness, saying his
actions had nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of those on
trial.
   Three men, including Meese's former personal lawyer, E. Robert
Wallach, and his ex-financial adviser, W. Franklyn Chinn, are to go
on trial Jan. 3 for allegedly extracting payoffs from Wedtech to
influence Meese and others.
   Meanwhile, the California State Bar said Wednesday it is
investigating Wallach's activities involving Wedtech and Meese, as
well as Meese himself.
   The McKay report, released Monday, found that in 1981 Wallach
asked Meese, then White House counsel, to help Wedtech, known as
Welbilt at the time, obtain a government contract. However, the
report found insufficient evidence to indict Meese on bribery
charges.
   The Wedtech defendants include Wedtech founder John Mariotta;
former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon; Peter Neglia,
one-time regional head of the Small Business Administration; and
Biaggi's eldest son, Richard.

<TEXT>
   It was vintage Michael Dukakis: talk of ``good
jobs at good wages,'' a vow to wage ``a real war, not a phony war''
on drugs, a little bit of Spanish and, from the tribute to his
immigrant parents to hopes for a grandchild yet unborn, a paean to
the American dream.
   But it was also the speech of Dukakis' life.
   Lines he has uttered hundreds of times, before tens of thousands
of people, from an airport hangar in Harlingen, Texas, to the
gold-domed statehouse in Boston, took on new vibrancy Thursday
night in the stirring 45-minute address with which he accepted the
Democratic nomination for president.
   It was his first extended opportunity to speak on television to
the millions of Americans whose votes he seeks. He hit every note.
   The crowd in the Omni gasped with delight when he broke into
Spanish in tribute to the late Hispanic organizer Willie Velasquez.
   Never mind that this polyglot politician parades his flawless
Spanish every chance he gets. It was as if he were doing it for the
very first time.
   He spoke of the American dream, as every candidate does, but it
did not sound hackneyed when he said, ``I'm a product of that
dream.''
   He choked up as he recalled his Greek father ``who arrived at
Ellis Island with only $25 in his pocket.''
   He spoke, as he always does, of creating ``good jobs at good
wages for every citizen in this land.''
   He said the election ``isn't about ideology. It's about
competence. ... It's not about insider trading on Wall Street; it's
about creating opportunity on Main Street.''
   He reclaimed John Winthrop for the Democrats, quoting not the
``city upon a hill'' line that is one of Ronald Reagan's favorites,
but another passage from the first governor of Massachusetts about
the need to ``knit together as one.''
   Like Reagan, he offered a pantheon of latter-day heroes: Dawn
Lawson, who went from the welfare rolls to a Fortune 500 company;
Bill Kraus, a Catholic priest in Denver finding jobs for the
homeless; George McKenna, grooming minority students from Los
Angeles' inner-city George Washington Prep for college.
   Dukakis' speaking style and message have another feature in
common with Reagan: a spirit of never-say-die optimism, an
unapologetic, resolute belief that ``we're going to forge a new era
of greatness for America.''
   He offered a salute to Reagan for cuts in nuclear arms, and the
delegates applauded _ somewhat reluctantly.
   He offered a slap at Reagan by promising not to pardon those who
``sell arms to the Ayatollah,'' and they roared.
   And he gave George Bush enough of a shove to set off a
full-throated reprise of the ``Where was George?'' chorus that
Teddy Kennedy and Tony Coelho started Tuesday. He said his vice
president would put a stop to any ``cockamanie idea'' such as
trading arms for hostages.
   For those who wondered how he would ever match the memorable
oratory of Jesse Jackson, Dukakis had a surprise.
   He paid tribute not just to the man he vanquished, but to his
children, ``those fine, handsome and proud and articulate Jackson
children'' who had their own moment on the stage earlier in the
convention.
   He finished with a flurry of references to children _ to young
Jacqueline Jackson, to Ann Richards' ``nearly perfect''
granddaughter Lily, and to his own first grandchild, due on
Inauguration Day.
   He invoked the memory of the oath the citizens of Athens took to
leave their country ``greater, better, stronger, prouder and more
beautiful than it was transmitted to us.''
   It was a speech containing very little new yet full of
surprises, none more surprising than the simple eloquence with
which the candidate rose to the occasion.

   The dollar declined sharply against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo Friday while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
also suffered a major decline.
   Following a drop of more than two yen against the Japanese yen
in New York overnight, the dollar closed in Tokyo at 132.08 yen,
down 1.42 yen from Thursday's close. The U.S. currency had opened
at 131.85 yen, and moved in a range of 131.63-132.20 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the most widely
followed barometer on the exchange, lost 391.13 points, or 1.41
percent, to close at 27,285.01.
   The volume traded on the first section of the exchange was 1.7
billion shares.
   A Bank of Japan official attributed the dollar's sharp decline
to ``the impact of cooperative intervention by central banks,''
according to Kyodo News Service.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar's downturn was the direct
result of the drop in New York.
   ``I don't see any outstanding factor which could depreciate the
dollar,'' said a dealer at a major U.S. investment bank in Tokyo.
   Other dealers said investment banks sold the dollar heavily this
morning as a result of the overnight decline, and that caused the
dollar's sharp drop in Tokyo.
   The dollar regained the 132-yen level in late morning when news
reports quoted Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as saying the yen's
sudden appreciation was not significant.
   Stock brokers attributed the decline in share prices to an
overnight decline on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell by more than 24 points.
   Furthermore, concern over higher interest rates sidelined many
investors, brokers said.

<TEXT>
   Israel's Arab enemies
have a combined air force almost as large as NATO's, and the threat
is growing with the prospect of an end to the Iran-Iraq war,
Israel's air force commander says.
   Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun said Israel's air force was investing
heavily in pilot training, new tactics and technology to meet the
challenge of an unprecedented Arab arms buildup.
   ``We are trying to keep the qualitative edge, but when you look
at the numbers, it gets more and more difficult all the time,''
Bin-Nun told reporters Thursday at the Hatzerim Air Force base in
the southern Negev Desert.
   But he added: ``We believe we can cope even with the new
technology the Arab countries are getting from all over the world.''
   Bin-Nun said most of the billions of dollars Arab countries have
spent on weapons in recent years have gone toward beefing up their
air power. He said Israel was especially concerned about the arms
buildup in Iraq, Syria and Saudia Arabia.
   ``The number of fighters that can attack Israel in 20 minutes of
flight is more than 1,500,'' he said.
   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies
says in its 1987-88 report that the Arab countries most likely to
engage in a war with Israel have a combined force of 2,358 combat
aircraft, compared to 676 in Israel and 2,409 in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's European deployment areas.
   Israel was very concerned about the recent $30 billion British
arms sale to Saudi Arabia, a country that has participated directly
or indirectly in all wars against Israel, Bin-Nun said.
   The package includes sophisticated Tornado fighter planes whose
range enables them to hit any Israeli target from Saudi Arabia, he
said.
   ``We must take into account that in case of war (against Israel)
the equipment either will be used by the Saudis or sent over to one
of the countries at war with us,'' Bin-Nun said.
   He said the agreement with Britain did not bar the Saudis from
sending weapons to other countries.
   In addition, Saudi Arabia has transferred billions of dollars
worth of arms purchased from the United States to Iraq, apparently
without U.S. approval, he said.
   With the prospect of a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, the
Iraqi air force also has become a greater threat, he said.
   He said Iraq has sophisticated fighter planes supplied by the
French and Soviets and has gained a great deal of experience during
the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   But Bin-Nun said the Iraqis ``haven't achieved what an air force
of this size could have achieved after so many years of
experience,'' and that Israel could cope with the threat.
   The Iranian air force poses no threat because it is small and
poorly maintained, said Bin-Nun.
   Another potential threat comes from Syria, one of Israel's most
implacable enemies, he said.
   Since Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Syria has tripled the
number of ground-to-air missiles, and today batteries of SAM-5
missiles are aimed at all of Israel's air space, he said.
   ``If you fly over the southern part of Israel above 20,000 feet,
you are under the cover of the SAM-5s,'' he said. ``You can shoot
down airplanes over here from Syria.''
   In addition, Syria reportedly is buying M-9 surface-to-surface
missiles from China and, according to Israeli officials, is
developing chemical warheads.
   ``We are taking the threat from Syria very seriously,'' Bin-Nun
said, but ``if we have to fight the Syrians, we will suprise them
again.''
   He also vowed that Israel would retaliate harshly against any
missile attack. During the 1973 Middle East war, for example, Syria
aimed a missile at a northern Israeli air force base, but struck an
Israeli village instead, he said.
   ``The next morning, 80 bombs hit general headquarters in the
middle of Damascus,'' he said. ``The air force is capable of
hitting any target within any distance. We proved it once, and we
hope we don't need to prove it again.''
   In another development, Bin-Nun said Israel hoped to sign a new
contract with the United States soon for the purchase of additional
F-15 fighter planes. He would not elaborate.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Say Bermudez's Election Jeopardizes Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Sandinistas say the
election of a guerrilla military leader to a key political role in
the rebel movement will jeopardize prospects for negotiating a
permanent peace.
   A Sandinista army officer, meanwhile, said 34 rebels were killed
during a series of attacks by guerrillas earlier this week.
   The election on Monday of Col. Enrique Bermudez to the political
directorate of the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance umbrella
organization ``makes the possibility of negotiating peace even more
remote,'' the Sandinista National Liberation Front's newspaper
Barricada said in an editorial.
   Bermudez was elected by rebel delegates to a meeting in the
Dominican Republic. His election ``removes the civilian mask'' from
the U.S.-backed Contra movement, Barricada says.
   Bermudez, commander of the main rebel army known as the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force, was a colonel in the national guard of
the right-wing Somoza dynasty that ruled Nicaragua for 42 years
until it was overthrown by the leftist Sandinistas in July 1979.
   Barricada said Bermudez's election ``ratified the Somoza
leadership in the (rebel) movement.''
   Maj. Ramon Caldera, chief of the general staff for the Fifth
Military Region, said government troops under his command repelled
rebel attacks Tuesday that were intended to disrupt celebrations
marking the ninth anniversary of the Sandinista regime. He said 34
Contras were killed.
   Caldera also said the Contras were secretly supplied with
weapons in four airdrops in northeastern Nueva Guinea province
during the first 15 days of July.
   Caldera made his remarks at a ceremony marking the discharge of
12,000 government troops from active service. He gave no details on
the attacks in central Chontales province and northern Boaca
province and did not mention government casualties.
   A Defense Ministry statement said two rebels died Wednesday when
a Contra group attacked an army patrol in Buenos Aires, about 148
miles north of the capital. It said Contras kidnapped six civilians
in the northern part of the country on Sunday and Tuesday.
   The statement, which gave no details, also said six rebels
deserted to Sandinista forces this week.
   A cease-fire has been in effect since March 21 in the 7-year-old
war between the Sandinista government and the Contras. Each side
has accused the other of violating the truce.
   President Daniel Ortega on Tuesday announced a unilateral
government extension of the cease-fire to Aug. 30. It had been set
to expire at the end of this month.
   No talks are scheduled to reach a lasting peace agreement. The
last round broke off in June.

   Contra leaders still may be able to negotiate with
seven field commanders who resigned to protest the growing power of
a hard-line military leader, a spokesman says.
   ``There is no crisis,'' Bosco Matamoros, spokesman for
Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella group, said Thursday.
``We had a generational change within our forces.''
   The seven commanders abandoned their southern front commands
Tuesday after the election of Enrique Bermudez _ who was already
the rebel military chief _ to the Contra ruling body. In May,
Bermudez forced out five major northern front military officials
who had demanded his resignation.
   The seven commanders denounced the election of Bermudez in
Nicaragua as an attempt by ``the extreme right'' to gain control of
the Contra movement.
   ``The commanders have the right to express their opinion,''
Matamoros said. ``Our organization is composed of volunteers.''
   But the resignations may not be final, he added.
   ``We will talk to them and see if they will reconsider,'' said
Matamoros.
   He claimed the dissidents command only ``a few hundred'' troops.
But the seven commanders, some of whom were important enough to
participate directly in recent peace talks with the Sandinistas,
say they represent all 2,700 rebel fighters on Nicaragua's southern
front along the Costa Rican border.
   Like dissidents before them on the northern front based in
Honduras, the southern commanders attacked Bermudez for corruption,
inefficiency and his close links to the hated National Guard of
deposed dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Bermudez was a colonel
in the guard before Somoza was overthrown by the Sandinistas in
1979.
   They also complained their troops are not receiving U.S.
humanitarian aid, unlike Bermudez's forces. From the beginning, the
southern front guerrillas have received but a fraction of the U.S.
aid given the larger, better known northern front Contra army.
   Matamoris said the newly elected seven-member directorate has
not issued any statements about the dissidents.
   The split is only the latest in a growing rift among Contra
leaders and military commanders. One issue is the peace talks with
the Sandinistas, which the dissidents accuse Bermudez of trying to
sabotage.
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, formerly the most liberal of the
directors and a spokesman for the dissidents, was dumped from the
ruling body during the Contra assembly meeting in the Dominican
Republic last weekend.

<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are developments on the final
day of the Democratic National Convention:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis starts campaigning today as the Democratic
Party's official nominee for president. Declaring ``the Reagan era
is over and a new era is about to begin,'' the son of Greek
immigrants accepted his party's nomination Thursday night.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BENTSEN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, winning the Democratic vice
presidential nomination by acclamation, acknowledged philosophical
differences with Dukakis but said the two agree ``on the basic
issues of justice and opportunity.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JACKSON</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The convention crowd exploded in cheers as onetime rival Jesse
Jackson strode on stage to shake hands with Dukakis, the man he
failed to defeat, and with Bentsen, whose job he wanted as a
consolation prize.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis' aides say he will contest every state with Vice
President George Bush, who will get the Republican presidential
nomination at the GOP convention in New Orleans Aug. 15-18.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush says the Democratic ticket will self-destruct because
Dukakis is a liberal and Bentsen is a conservative. ``I can't wait
for the debates _ Dukakis vs. Bentsen,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POLL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The convention appears to have helped Dukakis nationally. An ABC
poll taken Wednesday found the Democratic ticket with a 53 percent
to 41 percent lead over Bush, a significant jump from a 46-45
Republican lead in a poll taken Sunday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TV NETWORKS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Omni may have been turned into a big television studio, but
viewers weren't turning on their sets. Low ratings this week caused
them to think about cutting back on prime-time coverage. Network
ratings have been about 10 percent lower than in 1984.

   Here are excerpts from the speech by
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to the Democratic National
Convention on Thursday night accepting the party's nomination for
president.
   Tonight, as a son of immigrants with a wonderful wife and now,
with Lisa, our lovely daughter-in-law, four terrific children; as a
proud public servant who has cherished every minute of the last 16
months on the campaign trail, I accept your nomination for the
presidency of the United States.
   My friends, the dream that carried me to this platform is alive
tonight in every part of our country _ and it's what the Democratic
Party is all about. ...
   It's time to meet the challenge of the next American frontier _
the challenge of building an economic future for our country that
will create good jobs at good wages for every citizen in this land,
no matter who they are or where they come from or what the color of
their skin. ...
   It's time to rekindle the American spirit of invention and of
daring; to exchange voodoo economics for can-do economics; to build
the best America by bringing out the best in every American.
   It's time to wake up to the new challenges that face the
American family. ...
   I don't think I have to tell any of you how much we Americans
expect of ourselves.
   Or how much we have a right to expect from those we elect to
public office.
   Because this election is not about ideology. It's about
competence.
   It's not about overthrowing governments in Central America; it's
about creating jobs in middle America. That's what this election is
all about.
   It's not about insider trading on Wall Street; it's about
creating opportunity on Main Street.
   And it's not about meaningless labels. It's about American
values. Old-fashioned values like accountability and responsibility
and respect for the truth.
   And just as we Democrats believe that there are no limits to
what each citizen can do; so we believe that there are no limits to
what America can do....
   And, I'm very proud of our progress, but I'm even prouder of the
way we've made that progress _ by working together; by excluding no
one and including everyone; business and labor; educators and
community leaders and just plain citizens _ sharing responsibility;
exchanging ideas; building confidence about the future.
   And, my friends, what we have done reflects a simple but very
profound idea _ an idea as powerful as any in human history.
   It is the idea of community. It is the idea of community. The
kind of community that binds us here tonight.
   It is the idea that we are in this together; that regardless of
who we are or where we come from or how much money we have _ each
of us counts. And that by working together to create opportunity
and a good life for all _ all of us are enriched _ not just in
economic terms, but as citizens and as human beings. ...
   And as I accept your nomination tonight, I can't help recalling
that the first marathon was run in ancient Greece, and that on
importan occasions like this one, the people of Athens would
complete their ceremonies by taking a pledge.
   That pledge, that covenant, is as eloquent and as timely today
as it was 2,000 years ago.
   ``We will never bring disgrace to this, our country _ We will
never bring disgrace to this, our country, by any act of dishonesty
or of cowardice. We will fight for the ideals of this, our country.
We will revere and obey the law. We will strive to quicken our
sense of civic duty. Thus, in all these ways, we will transmit this
country greater, stronger, prouder and more beautiful than it was
transmitted to us.''
   That is my pledge to you, my fellow Democrats.
   And that is my pledge to you, my fellow Americans.

<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At age 24, Frank Montenegro Jr. felt he
was just starting adulthood, working at his first teaching job in
San Diego.
   But he willingly surrendered his bachelor life and went to court
to become the father of five younger siblings, who faced being
split up and sent to foster homes after their parents died within
three months of each other.
   Montenegro says he was determined to keep the family together.
   ``All of a sudden, you go from raising yourself to taking care
of five others,'' he said.
   Montenegro, who left his job and moved back to Northern
California to become head of the grieving household, was named
legal guardian Wednesday of three brothers and two sisters.
   The only condition the judge attached to the decision was that
Montenegro post a $25,000 security bond to protect the family in
case of his death.
   ``Who won? Who won?'' asked 8-year-old Jaime Montenegro, tugging
at his brother's trousers after a brief hearing in Alameda County
Superior Court.
   ``We won,'' said Montengro, the oldest of a family of eight
children orphaned earlier this year through the deaths of their
parents.
   Genevieve Montenegro, 42, died in March from a blood clot after
giving birth to a daughter. In May, Frank Montenegro Sr., 46, died
when he lost control of his van and crashed on a freeway off-ramp
near the family's home in Hayward, across the bay from San
Francisco.
   The couple's five dependent children could have been declared
wards of the court and placed in foster homes, but Montengro went
to court seeking guardianship.
   ``It has to be that way,'' he said. ``You have to have a
family.''
   Montenegro shrugged his shoulders when asked if he had any
regrets about assuming responsibility _ on a teacher's salary _ for
Philip, 16; Jaime, 8; Joaquin, 6; Genevieve, 5; and 4-month-old
Nicole, who has Down's syndrome.
   ``There's obviously going to be problems but you have to raise
your family,'' he said.
   The new family man runs the household with the help of three
aunts. Two younger brothers on their own _ Peter, 22, and Manuel,
19 _ also help from time to time.
   The community also has helped the Montenegros, raising money to
help pay for the parents' funerals and medical expenses for a
two-day hospital stay for Nicole, who caught pneumonia in May. A
trust fund at a Hayward bank had reached more than $8,600 as of
Wednesday.
   Montenegro is teaching summer school at an Oakland church, but
the family's finances will improve this fall, when he begins a
$23,000-a-year job as a bilingual teacher at an elementary school
in Fremont.
   Montenegro, while relieved at Wednesday's ruling, knows the
family's problems aren't over. ``That's one step toward raising
them up. We're just starting down that road,'' he said.
   His lawyer, Adele Fenstermacher, who volunteered her services,
is confident the Montengros will succeed.
   ``If there's anyone capable of doing it,'' she said, ``it's
Frank.''

<HEAD>Politicians Seek Unified Positive Response To North's Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean political leaders said
today they would try to respond positively to a North Korean call
for talks on a non-aggression pact between the two bitter rivals.
   Leaders of the south's four main political parties said they
would cooperate with each other to produce a united response by the
end of next week that could clear the way for talks.
   ``We will make efforts to seek an early realization of
inter-Korea parliamentary talks,'' said opposition leader Kim
Dae-jung.
   Communist North Korea sent an invitation Thursday to the South
Korean National Assembly for talks with the Supreme People's
Assembly in Pyongyang on a non-aggression pact drawn up by the
communist north.
   South Korean government and opposition leaders said preliminary
negotiations would be needed to work out the terms and details
before any agreement could be reached on parliamentary talks.
   Kim, opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil and
government Democratic Justice Party chairman Yoon Gil-joong said
they would try to use the north's proposals to promote contacts to
ease tension on the divided peninsula.
   South Korean Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok warned senior commanders
today that the north had substantial military superiority over the
south and its forces were poised for a lightning attack.
   The North Korean proposal received modest coverage in the South
Korean media. Many observers said the proposal did not appear to be
a major new development.
   The rival Koreas have presented a series of proposals in recent
months to ease tension and establish peace on the divided
peninsula. But each side has tended to ignore the other's
proposals, insisting its plans be followed.
   Talks between parliamentary delegations on a non-aggression pact
collapsed in 1986 when North Korea pulled out to protest routine
U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Similar efforts in the early
1970s also failed to make any progress.
   A government spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
talks between the rival governments should be held at the same time
as the parliamentary talks. He said any decision on a pact by the
south would be taken by the Seoul administration.
   South Korean insistence on inter-government talks could block
the parliamentary talks, since North Korea has been refusing to
deal with the Seoul government. Both governments claim they are the
sole legitimate government of Korea.
   North Korea refused to accept letters earlier this month from
the Seoul government calling for political, economic and
humanitarian talks on easing relations. South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo called for a major peace effort, but the north refused to
accept the letter outlining the proposal.
   North Korea has been insisting for months it wants to deal
directly with the ``people'' in the south and has continued to
denounce the Seoul government as a U.S.-backed puppet regime. It
apparently sent a letter to the National Assembly for this reason.
   The South Korean government and the opposition-dominated
National Assembly agree any talks with the north must be under the
administration's direction. Any North Korean delegation at peace
talks would be under direct government control because the north's
assembly is a powerless, rubberstamp body.
   South Korean political parties all support peaceful
reunification, but also fear the north remains determined to extend
communist rule over the peninsula.
   Political leaders in Seoul expressed concern North Korea did not
respond to the National Assembly's call to take part in the 1988
Olympic Games in Seoul. The North Korean proposal was in response
to the assembly's call for Pyongyang not to boycott the Games.
   North Korea has been demanding to co-host the Olympics, but
international Olympic officials said the Games can only be awarded
to a single city.
   The Korean peninsula was divided by U.S. and Soviet forces that
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. Efforts
to reunite the peninsula failed and separate governments were
declared in 1948.
   The communist north invaded the south in 1950 to start the
Korean War. About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in the south under a
mutual defense treaty.

   It wasn't a minute after the gavel fell on the
Democratic National Convention that delegates began scrambling for
souvenirs, barely ahead of the demolition crew hired to haul the $1
million podium off to the dump.
   Some delegates, like Sharon Mast, a school teacher from
Bellevue, Wash., even coveted the confetti that had rained down on
her head a few moments earlier.
   ``This isn't confetti at all,'' said the Dukakis delegate as she
scooped up a handful of the tiny, red, blue and silver pieces into
an envelope. ``This is magic fairy dust that will help us defeat
Bush this fall. It really won't take very much.''
   Hundreds of the 5,000 delegates and alternates in The Omni left
the coliseum carrying bags bulging with prizes they had picked up.
Some had bunches of balloons; others waved large aluminum and
cardboard replicas of the Greek flag.
   Alvin Chambliss Jr., a Jackson delegate from Oxford, Miss.,
walked out clutching his ``Bentsen No'' sign. ``There's no way I'm
going to leave this behind,'' he said.
   Some delegates were still searching for souvenirs when the first
members of the breakdown crew arrived, 30 minutes after the
convention's close.
   ``Now the fun begins,'' said Frank Taylor, one of several AT&T
technicians who were dismantling the computer voting terminals
scattered about the convention floor.
   Soon, a small army of laborers and technicians was pulling down
the light and sound systems, stacking chairs, ripping up the carpet
and using crowbars on the $1 million moveable podium from which
Democratic nominee Dukakis had addressed the delegates just an hour
before.
   ``We'll salvage the elevator and some of the other parts, then
we'll haul the rest off to the landfill,'' said William ``Pug''
Mabry, a general superintendent for Flagler Construction Co., which
helped construct the convention set.
   He said the work crews had 12 hours to remove the chairs, rip up
the carpet and temporary floor beneath it and then take out 50
miles of cables beneath the floor.
   ``In 12 hours there will be cranes in here, pulling down the TV
network anchor booths, which then will be taken to New Orleans for
the Republican convention next month.''
   In addition to the cable beneath the floor, the sound and
lighting crew had to remove some 500 lights and 15 miles of cable
above the floor.
   ``I know that sounds like a lot, but we had even more lights up
there for the Pink Floyd concert here a couple of months ago,''
said Chuck Adams, a spotlight technician.
   Mike Oshust, director of operations for The Omni coliseum, said
the work crews, in addition to removing 2,000 portable chairs, also
had to reinstall 5,500 fixed seats that were removed so the
Democrats could install their huge pink, blue and gray podium.
   ``It took us six weeks to put up the podium but we'll have it
completely torn down within eight days,'' he said.
   ``We've got to work fast because we've got another show coming
in on the 29th.''

<HEAD>CDC: Strategy May Be Needed To Get Hepatitis Vaccine to Drug

   Intravenous drug abusers have replaced
homosexuals as the chief risk group for contracting hepatitis B,
federal health officials said, suggesting national efforts to
vaccinate them have failed.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that its
ongoing study of hepatitis has found a ``striking'' increase in
hepatitis B among IV drug abusers, and a decrease among homosexuals
that was likely produced by fear of AIDS.
   Miriam Alter, the CDC's chief of hepatitis surveillance, said
she could not explain the increase among drug abusers. No reason
has been found ``other than the fact that apparently they're not
changing their behavior,'' she said.
   Hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver caused by one of several
viruses, is contagious and can be fatal. Hepatitis B tends to be
more severe than hepatitis A, and is a more serious problem for
health officials because hepatitis B patients can become lifetime
carriers of the infection.
   Since 1985, drug abuse has surpassed homosexual activity as the
chief risk factor for hepatitis B infection, the CDC said in its
weekly report.
   The drop in homosexual cases ``is most likely a result of
modification of high-risk sexual behavior'' prompted by the fear of
AIDS, the Atlanta-based health agency said.
   Even though a vaccine has been available for six years, the CDC
said, there has been a steady increase in hepatitis B cases
nationwide over the last decade. The United States has about
300,000 infections per year now, compared with 200,000 per year in
the late 1970s, Alter said, adding that exact figures are
unavailable because only a small percentage of cases are reported.
   She suggested that efforts to vaccinate high-risk groups against
hepatitis B have failed because of the difficulty in identifying
high-risk people and because the vaccine must be administered in
three doses over six months.
   ``It's hard to find them and to get them to come back for all
three doses,'' she said.
   The CDC report cited another possible reasons for the failure of
vaccination efforts: many patients are already infected by the time
they are identified as belonging to a risk group.
   ``Failure to overcome these obstacles will necessitate
consideration of a broader immunization strategy,'' the CDC said.
   Such a strategy could include routine hepatitis immunizations
for children or adolescents, Alter said, although the CDC is not
yet recommending any particular strategy.
   ``We want to make people aware that the current strategy is not
working ... and to make people think about possible alternative
strategies that may become necessary,'' she said.
   The CDC's hepatitis study, begun in 1982, monitors four counties
_ Denver County, Colo.; Jefferson County, Ala.; Pierce County,
Wash.; and Pinellas County, Fla. _ to determine trends in hepatitis
infection.
   The CDC said drug abusers accounted for 28 percent of the
hepatitis B cases in the four counties in 1987, up from 15 percent
in 1982. By contrast, the percentage of homosexual cases dropped
from 20 percent in 1982 to 9 percent in 1987.
   Hepatitis can be transmitted through sexual contact, sharing of
IV needles, frequent contact with blood in the health professions,
household contact with a carrier, blood transfusions, dialysis and
residency in an institution for the developmentally disabled.
   More than 30 percent of the cases have no known source, the CDC
said.

   Critics who accuse the Democrats of being big
spenders might talk to 22-year-old Marc Homer, an alternate Wyoming
delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
   Homer managed to attend the four-day convention on less than $25
dollars a day.
   ``I rode the bus out here and am staying in a dorm room at
Georgia Tech for $15 a night,'' he said Thursday. The 44-hour bus
ride cost $69 and he will spend the same amount on a circuitous
route home.
   ``I haven't had to spend anything hardly on food,'' he added.
``There are so many parties with free food.''

Superdome,
   Democrats held their convention this week in Atlanta at The
Omni, which could hold only about 11,000 people. More than 14,000
people attended the four-day convention, and the coliseum had to be

   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, in his speech accepting the Democratic
nomination for president, rallying his party to battle Republican
Vice President George Bush: ``It's time to rekindle the American
spirit of invention and daring, to exchange voodoo economics for
can-do economics, to build the best America by bringing out the
best in every American.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, in his speech accepting the vice-presidential
nomination, acknowledging that he and Dukakis differ on some
issues: ``We Democrats do not march in lockstep behind some narrow,
rigid ideology. ... We are not gray grains of oatmeal in a bland
porridge of privilege. ... Of course we have differences of
opinion. But on the basic issues of justice and opportunity, we
stand united.''
   
   BENTSEN, on how he will campaign against Bush: ``Mine will not
be a personal attack. He's a friend of mine, and our wives are
friends. We're talking about differences on issues and differences
on results.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, after saying he didn't feel let down by losing
the nomination: ``Our work continues ... this quest for jobs and
peace and justice and fairness, expansion and inclusion, that
campaign isn't over with.''
   
   KITTY DUKAKIS, speaking at a restaurant for the homeless where
she ate lunch: ``I would be a very active first lady, involved in
this issue and other issues that I feel are important.''
   
   WILLIE BROWN, Jackson campaign chairman, said after meeting with
the Congressional Black Caucus: ``Jackson's people and Dukakis'
people are now one and the same.''
   
   Arkansas Gov. BILL CLINTON, reacting to the poor reception given
to his lengthy speech nominating Dukakis, said the speech ran
longer than expected because Dukakis campaign people kept rousing
the crowd to cheer: ``I'm not mad or anything. It's just one of
those weird deals.... My guess is that it's just a one-day story
and nothing to get in a deep funk about. It will be just a whiff on
the screen.''
   
   JERRY CALVERT, a delegate from Montana, complaining that the
careful convention choreography took away its spontaneity: ``The
whole focus has been subordinated to TV showmanship. This
convention is much less a deliberative body than a television
extravaganza. And that's bad.''
   
   Former President JIMMY CARTER, commenting on references to
Dukakis' fluency in Spanish and Carter's once addressing an
Organization of American States meeting in Spanish, laughed and
said: ``I don't think either the Latin contingent or the Americans
could understand what I said.''

   Here is a transcript of the speech by
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to the Democratic National
Convention as he accepted the party's presidential nomination.
   A few months ago, when Olympia Dukakis, in front of about a
billion-and-a-half television viewers all over the world, raised
that Oscar over her head and said, ``OK, Michael, let's go,'' she
wasn't kidding.
   And Kitty and I are grateful to her for that wonderful
introduction and grateful to all of you for making this possible.
   This is a wonderful evening for us and we thank you from the
bottom of our hearts.
   My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans.
   Sixteen months ago, when I announced my candidacy for the
presidency of the United States, I said this campaign would be a
marathon.
   Tonight, with the wind at our backs; with friends at our sides;
and with courage in our hearts; the race to the finish line begins.
   And we're going to win this race, we're going to win this race.
   We're going to win because we are the party that believes in the
American dream.
   A dream so powerful that no distance of ground, no expanse of
ocean, no barrier of language, no distinction of race or creed or
color can weaken its hold on the human heart.
   And I know, because, my friends, I'm a product of that dream,
and I'm proud of it.
   A dream that brought my father to this country 76 years ago;
that brought ;mother and her family here one year later _ poor,
unable to speak English; but with a burning desire to succeed in
their new land of opportunity.
   And tonight, in the presence of that marvelous woman who is my
mother and who came here 75 years ago; with the memory in my heart
of the young man, who arrived at Ellis Island with only $25 in his
pocket, but with a deep and abiding faith in the promise of America
_ and how I wish he was here tonight. He would be very proud of his
son.
   And he'd be very proud of his adopted country, I can assure you.
   Tonight, as a son of immigrants with a wonderful wife and now,
with Lisa, our lovely daughter-in-law, four terrific children; as a
proud public servant who has cherished every minute of the last 16
months on the campaign trail, I accept your nomination for the
presidency of the United States.
   My friends, the dream that carried me to this platform is alive
tonight in every part of our country _ and it's what the Democratic
Party is all about.
   Henry Cisneros of Texas, Bob Matsui of California, Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland, Mario Cuomo of New York, Claude Pepper of
Florida, and Jesse Louis Jackson.
   A man who has lifted so many hearts with the dignity and the
hope of his message throughout this campaign; a man whose very
candidacy has said to every child _ aim high; to every citizen _
you count; to every voter _ you can make a difference; to every
American _ you are a full shareholder in our dream.
   And, my friends, if anyone tells you that the American dream
belongs to the privileged few and not to all of us; you tell them
that the Reagan era is over. You tell that the Reagan era is over
and that a new era is about to begin.
   Because it's time to raise our sights _ to look beyond the
cramped ideals and the limited ambitions of the past eight years _
to recapture the spirit of energy and of confidence and of idealism
that John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson inspired a generation ago.
   It's time to meet the challenge of the next American frontier _
the challenge of building an economic future for our countjthat
will create good jobs at good wages for every citizen in this land,
no matter who they are or wre they come from or what the color of
their skin.

   It's time to rekindle the American spirit of invention and of
daring; to exchange voodoo economics for can-do economics; to build
the best America by bringing out the best in every American.
   It's time to wake up to the new challenges that face the
American family.
   Time to see that young families in this country are never again
forced to choose between the jobs they need and the children they
love; time to be sure that parents are never again told that no
matter how long they work or how hard their child tries, a college
education is a right they can't afford.
   It's time to ask why it is that we have run up more debt in this
country in the last eight years than we did in the previous 200;
and to make sure it never happens again.
   It's time to understand that the greatest threat to our national
security in this hemisphere is not the Sandinistas _ it's the
avalanche of drugs that is pouring into this country and poisoning
our kids.
   I don't think I have to tell any of you how much we Americans
expect of ourselves.
   Or how much we have a right to expect from those we elect to
public office.
   Because this election is not about ideology. It's about
competence.
   It's not about overthrowing governments in Central America; it's
about creating jobs in middle America. That's what this election is
all about.
   It's not about insider trading on Wall Street; it's about
creating opportunity on Main Street.
   And it's not about meaningless labels. It's about American
values. Old-fashioned values like accountability and responsibility
and respect for the truth.
   And just as we Democrats believe that there are no limits to
what each citizen can do; so we believe that there are no limits to
what America can do.
   And, yes, I know, this fall, we're going to be hearing a lot of
Republican talk about how well some neighborhoods and some regions
of this country are doing; about how easy it is for some families
to buy a home or to find child care or to pay their doctor's bills
or to send their children to college.
   But, my friends, maintaining the status quo _ running in place _
standing still _ isn't good enough for America. Opportuniories the
finest in the world; and we're going to make teaching a valued and
honored profession once again in this country.
   We're going to light fires of innovation and enterprise from
coast to coast and we're going to give those on welfare the chance
to lift themselves out of poverty; to get the child care and the
training they need; the chance to step out into the bright sunshine
of opportunity and of hope and of dignity.

   We're going to invest in our urban neighborhoods; and we're
going to work to revitalize small town and rural America. We're
going to give our farm families a price they can live on, and farm
communities a future they can count on.
   We're going to build the kind of America that Lloyd Bentsen has
been fighting for for the past 40 years; the kind of America where
hard work is rewarded; where American goods and American
workmanship are the best in the world, the kind of America that
provides American workers and their families with at least 60 days
notice when a factory or a plant shuts down.
   Now, I know, I have a reputation for being a somewhat frugal
man. But let me state for the record that that snow blower is still
in good working order, even as it sits in our garage.
   In nine years, I've balanced nine more budgets than this
administration has and I've just balanced a tenth. And I've worked
with the citizens of my state _ worked hard to create hundreds of
thousands of new jobs _ and I mean good jobs, jobs you can raise a
family on, jobs you can build a future on, jobs you can count on.
   And, I'm very proud of our progress, but I'm even prouder of the
way we've made that progress _ by working together; by excluding no
one and including everyone; business and labor; educators and
community leaders and just plain citizens _ sharing responsibility;
exchanging ideas; building confidence about the future.
   And, my friends, what we have done reflects a simple but very
profound idea _ an idea as powerful as any in human history.
   It is the idea of community. It is the idea of community. The
kind of community that binds us here tonight.
   It is the idea that we are in this together; that regardless of
who we are or where we come from or how much money we have _ each
of us counts. And that by working together to create opportunity
and a good life for all _ all of us are enriched _ not just in
economic terms, but as citizens and as human beings.
   The idea of community _ an idea that was planted in the new
world by the first governor of Massachusetts.
   ``We must,'' said John Winthrop, ``love one another with a pure
heart fervently. We must delight in each other, make each other's
condition our own, rejoice together, mourn together, and suffer
together...We must,'' he said, ``be knit together as one.'' Be knit
together as one.
   Now, John Winthrop wasn't talking about material success. He was
talking about a country where each of us asks not only what's in it
for some of us, but what's good and what's right for all of us.
   When a young mother named Dawn Lawson leaves seven years of
welfare to become a personnel specialist in a Fortune 500 company
in Worcester, Mass. _ we are all enriched and ennobled.
   When a Catholic priest named Bill Kraus helps homeless families
in Denver not just by giving them shelter, but by helping them to
find the jobs they need to get back on their feet, we are all
enriched and ennobled.
   When a high school principal named George McKenna and a
dedicated staff of teachers and counselors create an environment
for learning at the George Washington Preparatory High School in
Los Angeles; a high school in Los Angeles that is 90 percent black
and 10 percent Hispanic and has 80 percent of its graduates
accepted to college; we are all enriched and ennobled.

   My friends, as president, I'm going to be setting goals for our
country; not goals for our government working alone; I mean goals
for our people working together.
   I want businesses in this country to be wise enough and
innovative enough to retrain their workers, and retool their
factories, and to help rebuild their communities.
   I want students and office workers and retired teachers to share
with a neighbor the precious gift of literacy.
   I want those of you who are bricklayers and carpenters and
developers and housing advocates to work with us to help create
decent and affordable housing for every family in America, so that
we can once and for all end the shame of homelessness in the United
States of America.
   I want our young scientists to dedicate their great gifts not to
the destruction of life, but to its preservation; I want them to
wage war on hunger and pollution and infant mortality; and I want
them to work with us to win the war against AIDS, the greatest
public health emergency of our lifetimes, and a disease that must
be conquered.
   I want a new attorney general. I want a new attorney general to
work with me and with law enforcement officers all over America to
reclaim our streets and neighborhoods from those who commit violent
crime.
   And I want the members of the Congress to work with me _ and I'm
going to work with them _ so that, at long last, we can make good
on Harry Truman's commitment to basic health insurance for every
family in America.
   My friends, the dream that began in Philadelphia 200 years ago;
the spirit that survived that terrible winter at Valley Forge and
triumphed on the beaches at Normandy; the courage that looked
Khrushchev in the eye during the Cuban missile crisis _ is as
strong and as vibrant today as it has ever been.
   We must be _ we are _ and we will be _ militarily strong.
   But we must back that military strength with economic strength;
we must give the men and women of our armed forces weapons that
work; we must have a secretary of defense who will manage _ and not
be managed by _ the Pentagon; and we must have a foreign policy
that reflects the decency and the principles and the values of the
American people.
   President Reagan has set the stage for deep cuts in nuclear arms
_ and I salute him for that.
   He has said that we should judge the Soviet Union not by what it
says, but by what it does _ and I agree with that.

   But we can do a lot more to stop the spread of nuclear and
chemical arms in this world. We can do a lot more to bring peace to
Central America and the Middle East. And we can and we will do a
lot more to end apartheid in South Africa.
   John Kennedy once said that America ``leads the ... world, not
just because we are the richest or the strongest or the most
powerful, but because we exert that leadership for the cause of
freedom around the globe ... and ... because,'' in his words, ``we
are moving on the road to peace.''
   Yes, we must always be prepared to defend our freedom.
   But we must always remember that our greatest strength comes not
from what we possess, but from what we believe; not from what we
have, but from who we are.
   You know, I've been asked many times over the past 16 months if
I have one very special goal for these next four years _ something
that reflects everything I stand for and believe in as an American.
   And the answer to that question is yes, I do.
   My friends, four years from now, when our citizens walk along
Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., or when they see a picture
of the White House on television, I want them to be proud of their
government. I want them to be proud of a government that sets high
standards not just for the American people, but high standards for
itself.
   We're going to have a Justice Department that isn't the
laughingstock of the nation. We're going to have a Justice
Department that understands what the word ``justice'' means.
   We're going to have nominees to the federal bench who are men
and women of integrity and intelligence and who understand the
Constitution of the United States.
   We're going to have an Environmental Protection Agency that is
more interested in stopping pollution than in protecting the
polluters.
   We're going to have a real war, not a phony war, against drugs;
and my friends, we won't be doing business with drug-running
Panamanian dictators any more.
   We're going to have a vice president who won't sit silently by
when somebody at the National Security Council comes up with the
cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for
hostages.
   We're going to have a vice president named Lloyd Bentsen who
will walk into the Oval Office and say, ``Mr. President, this is
outrageous and it's got to stop.'' That's the kind of vice
president we're going to have.
   And in the Dukakis White House, as in the Dukakis State House,
if you accept the privilege of public service, you had better
understand the responsibilities of public service. If you violate
that trust, you'll be fired. If you violate the law, you'll be
prosecuted. And if you sell arms to the ayatollah, don't expect a
pardon from the president of the United States.
   Monday night, like millions of Americans, I laughed and was
moved by the wit and wisdom of Ann Richards. And Tuesday night,
along with millions of other Americans, I was inspired, as you

   But what stirred me most on Monday was a grandmother talking
about her ``nearly perfect'' granddaughter; and what stirred me
most on Tuesday were those handsome and proud and articulate
Jackson children _ those Jackson children talking about their hopes
for the future of their country.
   You know, young Jackie Jackson goes to school in my state. And
last month, she visited with me in the State House in Boston. She's
a remarkable young woman, and I know her parents are very, very
proud of her.
   My thoughts tonight _ and my dreams for America _ are about Ann
Richards' granddaughter Lily; about young Jackie Jackson; and about
the baby that's going to be born to our son John and his wife Lisa
in January. As a matter of fact the baby is due on or about Jan. 20.
   God willing, our first grandchild will reach the age that Jackie
Jackson is now at the beginning of a new century. And we pray that
he or she will reach that age with eyes as filled with the sparkle
of life and of pride and of optimism as that young woman we watched
together two nights ago.
   Yes, my friends, it's a time for wonderful new beginnings.
   A little baby.
   A new administration.
   A new era of greatness for America.
   And when we leave here tonight, we will leave to build that
future together.
   To build that future so that when our children and our
grandchildren look back in their time on what we did in our time;
they will say that we had the wisdom to carry on the dreams of
those who came before us; the courage to make our own dreams come
true and the foresight to blaze a trail for generations yet to come.
   And as I accept your nomination tonight, I can't help recalling
that the first marathon was run in ancient Greece, and that on
important occasions like this one, the people of Athens would
complete their ceremonies by taking a pledge.
   That pledge, that covenant, is as eloquent and as timely today
as it was 2,000 years ago.
   ``We will never bring disgrace to this, our country _ We will
never bring disgrace to this, our country, by any act of dishonesty
or of cowardice. We will fight for the ideals of this, our country.
We will revere and obey the law. We will strive to quicken our
sense of civic duty. Thus, in all these ways, we will transmit this
country greater, stronger, prouder and more beautiful than it was
transmitted to us.''
   That is my pledge to you, my fellow Democrats.
   And that is my pledge to you, my fellow Americans.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas to the Democratic National Convention as he
accepted the party's vice presidential nomination.
   Thank you very much.
   John Glenn is one of the most talented, respected figures in
America. And I thank him for a very gracious introduction.
   And Danny Rostenkowski, Tom Daschle, Barbara Jordan, Mickey
Leland, what great friends you are.
   Thank you very much.
   And I thank you, my fellow Democrats, for this high honor.
   I am proud and pleased to accept your nomination for vice
president of the United States of America.
   In four months America will elect a new president.
   And his name will be Michael Dukakis.
   His theme will be economic opportunity for all. His values will
be honesty, integrity, and fairness. And his party will be a united
Democratic Party.
   Twenty-eight years ago, our party nominated a president from
Massachusetts and a vice president from Texas. The Texan on that
ticket was Lyndon Baines Johnson. Lyndon Johnson knew then what you
and I know so well today. The equality of opportunity is the
ultimate civil right.
   His vision and his victories paved the way for Democratic
leaders like Rev. Jesse Jackson whose eloquence, whose leadership
and achievements transcend pride of party and inspire a nation.
   Tonight the hopes of a nation _ the incredible energy and
diversity of America _ are focused on Atlanta. This convention
reflects that energy and diversity.
   We are a mirror of America.
   We Democrats don't march in lockstep behind some narrow, rigid
ideology of indifference. We are not gray grains of oatmeal in a
bland porridge of privilege.
   Our way, the Democratic way, is to tackle the tough problems.
Our way is to search out the honest answers and stand by our
principles.
   Of course, we have differences of opinion. But on the basic
issues of justice and opportunity, we stand united.
   Democrats agree that a good job at a fair wage is the passport
to opportunity in America.
   Democrats agree that America needs a trade policy based on the
simple premise of fairness. We demand that nations selling goods
freely into our country, that we have full access to their markets.
   Democrats agree that the economic, trade, and energy policies of
the Reagan-Bush administration have devastated vast areas of
America. We see an agricultural economy that has been driven to its
knees: We see the energy economy reeling in crisis. We see the loss
of more than one million high-paying jobs in manufacturing.
   Democrats agree that the American worker who has struggled for
20 years to support his or her family, has earned 60 days noe when
that management closes down a plant.
   But the Reagan-Bush administration thinks a pink slip in the
mail is notice enough. That's their notion of fairness. That's
their message to the working men and women of America.

   Democrats want a strong national defense, and we will pay the
price to defend freedom. But we also demand a careful accounting
for our hard-earned dollars. And we will not tolerate the
corruption and greed that threatens to undermine our military might.
   Democrats agree that decent housing, a clean environment, a good
education, and quality health care should be the birthright of
every American citizen and not the private domain of a privileged
few.
   So make no mistake about it. We are united in our commitment to
do better for America.
   My friends, America has just passed through the ultimate epoch
of illusion: An eight-year coma in which slogans were confused with
solutions and rhetoric passed for reality; a time when America
tried to borrow its way to prosperity and became the largest debtor
nation in the history of mankind; when the Reagan-Bush
administration gave lip service to progress while fighting a
frantic, losing battle to turn back the clock on civil rights and
equal opportunity; a time of tough talk on foreign policy and
strange tales of double-dealing Swiss bank accounts, and a botched
campaign against a drug-running tinhorn dictator.
   The Reagan-Bush administration likes to talk about prosperity.
But the farmers in Iowa don't hear them. The oil field workers in
Texas and Oklahoma and Louisiana don't hear them. The factory
workers in John Glenn's Ohio don't hear them.
   My fellow Democrats, it is easy enough to create an illusion of
prosperity. All you have to do is write hot checks for $200 billion
a year. That's what the Reagan-Bush administration has done. That's
how they doubled our national debt in just seven years.
   At long last the epoch of illusion is drawing to a close.
America is ready for the honest, proven, hands-on, real-world
leadership of Michael Dukakis backed by the power of a united,
committed Democratic Party.
   For 200 years America has worked better than any society in
history. A major reason for our success is that every generation of
Americans has accepted[presponsibility to expand the frontiers of
individual opportunity. We have expanded that opportunity through
universal education, the Homestead Act, land-grant colleges,
women's suffrage, Social Security, the GI bill, civil rights, and
health care.
   Taken together and placed in the context of the free enterprise
system, these progressive actions made America the land of
opportunity. They created a magnet that drew millions of people
from around the world to America _ people like Michael Dukakis'
father from Greece, like my grandfather from Denmark, like your
relatives who came here willing to accept enormous risks and
dangers in return for the chance for a step up in life.

   Recently, it has become more difficult for working Americans to
take that step up.
   Oh, I see the charts and numbers that suggest prosperity. But I
also talk with those people and I hear what they say.
   I know that if you are a teacher, or a factory worker, or if you
are just starting a family, it's almost impossible to buy a house _
no matter how hard you work or how carefully you save.
   A college education is slipping beyond the reach of millions of
hard-working Americans. If you have a child that's born today, plan
on having $60,000 in the bank when that child reaches the age of 18
in the hopes of sending that child to a public university. And if
the Republicans have their way, you won't have any college loan
program to help work it out for you.
   When Michael Dukakis talks about the economics of opportunity,
he is talking about making our country work again. He's talking
about putting the American dream back in the reach of all the
American people. He is talking sense _ and America is listening.
   Michael Dukakis understands the reality of America. But even
more important, he understands the potential of America. He turned
around the economy of Massachusetts, not by writing hot checks, but
by careful planning, careful management of the taxpayers' dollar,
and a healthy respect for the entrepreneurial system.
   When the nation's governors were asked: Who among you is the
most effective leader, the answer was Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts. When millions of Democrats went to the polls this
year to choose the leader who will blaze America's path during the
21st century, they chose Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   Michael Dukakis has the uncanny knack of bringing forth the very
best in America. He knows that government can't solve all our
problems. But he also understands that government has an obligation
to lead.
   Michael Dukakis and I will lead a government that cares about
people, about jobs, about all regions of America, about housing and
the homeless, about the defense of freedom, about education and
health care, about justice and opportunity for all Americans.
   We believe America deserves an administration that will obey the
law, tell the truth, and insist all who serve it do the same.
   We believe the best way to lead America is by force of character
and personal integrity.
   This convention has been a triumph for Michael Dukakis and the
Democratic Party. It has certainly been a proud moment for me and
for my family. My wife, B.A., my sons, my daughter, and their
families are here tonight to share this honor with me.
   My father is also here. He is 94 years old, proud of his
country, and proud of his son.
   Dad, you have been telling the reporters stories about me
lately, so let me tell one about youpy father is a symbol of what
people of courage and vision and daring can achieve in America.

   He has lived the American dream _ the dream we want to come true
for our children.
   Talk about risk-takers. His family came to this country across
the ocean, across the prairie, and homesteaded on the plains of
South Dakota when the government would bet you 160 acres that you
couldn't make it through the winter.
   They built a sod house, and when that first blizzard blew in,
they took turns staying awake for 36 hours, burning bundles of
straw so they wouldn't freeze to death.
   But like your ancestors, they made it through the storm. They
made it through the winter. They planted and harvested and
eventually they prospered.
   They made their way in America.
   My father made his way to Texas. And I've made my way to Atlanta
with Michael Dukakis to stand before my family, before a united
Democratic Party, before the American people, to accept your
nomination as vice president of the United States of America.
   Now, that's the American dream that we have nourished and
protected for 200 years _ the dream of freedom and opportunity, the
chance for a step up in life.
   I want to help Michael Dukakis protect that dream for the next
generation. And I want to help Michael Dukakis maintain freedom as
the most powerful and persuasive force on earth. And I want to
thank all of you for the opportunity to serve America.
   Thank you very much.

<TEXT>
   Health issues among gays and lesbians, including
concerns about high alcohol and drug dependency rates, are on the
agenda for 1,500 people gathered here for the 10th National Lesbian
and Gay Health Conference.
   The five-day conference and AIDS Forum will provide participants
with ``a knowledge of the needs of the lesbian and gay community,''
Ellen Ratner, president of the sponsoring National Lesbian and Gay
Health Foundation, said as the meeting began Thursday.
   One concern is drug dependency and alcoholism rates among
lesbians and gays, which are ``at least twice and probably thrice
the national average,'' said Ratner, the founder of New England's
Wollaston II Psychiatric Day Treatment Center.
   ``It's probably because we're forced to hide so much. It's hard
for us to come to grips with ourselves and it forces us into
closets,'' Ratner said. ``And people who are in closets, or they're
oppressed, they drink, they drug.''
   Members of various organizations can make contacts during the
conference, and prominent members of the community will be honored,
she said.
   Among those to receive awards are Rep. Barney Frank and Rep.
Gerry Studds, two openly gay Democratic congressmen from
Massachusetts. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is scheduled to
address the conference Monday.
   Events range from banquets and Yoga exercises to more than 350
diverse forums.
   Phil Carsmel, a member of Australia's National AIDS Advisory
Council, said he had attended the International Conference on Aids
in Stockholm last month and hoped to learn more about America's
fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome during the Boston
meeting.
   AIDS, which has no known cure, is spread primarily through
sexual contact or contaminated intravenous needles shared by drug
abusers.
   ``Stockholm is the theories, this conference is the practice,''
said Carsmel, a Melbourne resident. ``This is where we translate
the ideas into the real world.''
   Susanne Morgan, a sociology professor at Ithaca College in New
York, said she attended the conference to meet other educators and
to learn about new materials she could use for presentations to
student lesbian and gay groups she advises.
   ``I want to do some networking,'' Morgan said. ``I want to meet
people doing work among campuses.''
   When the first conference was held in Washington in 1978, fewer
than 200 people attended.
   ``The swelling numbers tell us there are a lot of people
concerned, that there are a lot of people that want to continue to
learn, that this is a community that needs to network with each
other,'' Ratner said. ``We're a community that's really starting to
come together.''
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Nicaragua denied visas to three
members of that country's Health Ministry who had planned to attend
the conference.
   Ratner said the three were members of a technical advisory team
on AIDS. The visa denial, she said, ``denied us _ and the world _
the value of their knowledge and experience.''
   The visa refusals were based on concerns that the three
officials might not return to Nicaragua, State Department spokesman
Ben Justenfen said.

   A moderate earthquake hit Anchorage and
its outskirts, but there were no reports of damage, officials at
the Tsunami Warning Center of the National Weather Service reported.
   The temblor registered 4.6 on the open-ended scale at just
before midnight Thursday and was centered about 30 miles north of
Anchorage, said Wayne Jorgensen of the quake observatory.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10
times stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in a local area; 4 can cause moderate damage. An 8 reading
is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.
   The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4 on the
Richter scale, while the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 has been
estimated at 8.3.

   Jesse Jackson's Democrats are leaving Atlanta
divided on the question of unity, with many warning that they need
time to heal their disappointment before they can judge Michael
Dukakis.
   ``It's much too early in the campaign for me to lay down my
Jackson sign and pick up a Dukakis sign,'' said LesKimber, a
Jackson delegate from Fresno, Calif. ``You can't turn off these
things like a water faucet.''
   Kimber and other Jackson delegates interviewed on the closing
night of the Democratic convention said they were wary of Dukakis
and reluctant for now to back his candidacy, Jackson's urging for
unity notwithstanding.
   Other Jackson supporters pledged their wholehearted support.
``We came here together and we're leaving even closer together,''
said Joel Ferguson, Jackson delegation leader from Michigan.
   But in fact his own ranks were split.
   ``We have a lot of angry people from Michigan,'' said Jackson
delegate Arthur Wiggins of Detroit. ``He was not fairly treated at
all. Some people think it's because he is a minister. Some think
it's the color of his skin.''
   Dukakis and Jackson declared their unity after a pre-convention
summit Monday and many of Jackson's supporters in leadership roles
took the cue and endorsed Dukakis.
   A considerable share of about 20 Jackson delegates interviewed
Thursday accepted the Dukakis-Jackson pact.
   But at least as many said no, not yet.
   ``Right now it looks good on television. But you have to see how
many Jackson people are brought into the process,'' said Chicago
delegate Mark Allen. ``You can't go to a bunch of blacks and say,
`rise up,' with nothing but white folks at the front.
   ``There's hope. We've talked about partnership,'' said Allen.
``But there's still a lot of ill feelings in the wind.''
   In swing states such as Allen's, resolution of those conflicts
may be critical for the Dukakis campaign. Enthusiastic support from
blacks could provide crucial votes, while lukewarm backing could
prove crippling.
   ``It's one thing to say, yes, I'll vote,'' said Allen. ``But is
there enough here to make the masses of people say, `I'll get
everybody on my block to vote?' That remains to be seen.''
   There was doubt in the South, as well. Jackson's state
coordinator from Virginia, Mary Cox, predicted that his voters in
her state would be cool to Dukakis. And she had harsh words for the
Dukakis delegates from Virginia:
   ``They talk about compromise, but what they want is for us to
compromise,'' she said. ``They want everything.''
   From Georgia, Jackson campaign chairman Gene Walker sounded a
more hopeful, but still cautious note. ``The partnership so far has
been real,'' he said. ``And make sure you put `so far.'
   In the Texas delegation, about 15 black delegates remained
seated during a standing ovation for Bentsen; one said they were
unimpressed with his civil rights record.
   The delegates who were skittish about the Democratic ticket said
it would take time to measure Dukakis' commitment to their
constituencies. Many said they wanted to see whether he helps
blacks gain party posts at the state and local levels.
   ``There are grounds for suspicion,'' said Kimber, vice mayor of
Fresno. ``Dukakis talks about commitment to affirmative action,''
but passed up Jackson for vice president, he said. ``So of course
there's suspicion. There is suspicion as to his beliefs versus his
rhetoric.''
   But Jackson delegates did express general satisfaction with the
party platform. And their fears about Dukakis pale when compared to
the ill feeling toward Vice President George Bush, who is to be the
Republican nominee.
   The question on Dukakis thus might be not whether they support
him, the delegates said, but how energetically.
   ``Jackson cares about people. Dukakis, I'm not sure,'' said
Wiggins. ``But if I don't vote, it's a vote for Bush. I understand
that very well.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Murder-Solicitation Charge in Anniversary Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOLIET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A murder-solicitation charge has been
dismissed against a woman whose arrest on charges of hiring a
gunman to kill her husband was published in a newspaper on the same
day as her happy anniversary message.
   The motion to drop the charge came after Mary Borunda's daughter
_ a key witness in the case _ refused to testify against her, said
Assistant State's Attorney Douglas DeBoer.
   ``I think my client is very pleased that this is over,'' Ms.
Borunda's attorney, Winston Block, said after Will County Circuit
Judge Bruce Falk approved a prosecution motion Thursday to drop the
charge against her.
   ``They appear to be a very happy couple,'' he added.
   The investigation began when the daughter, identified by Block
as Janet Taylor, went to police with information that led to the
charge against Ms. Borunda, DeBoer said earlier Thursday. The
daughter's refusal to testify left the state no alternative but to
dismiss the charge, he said.
   ``There were numerous allegations. ... Further investigation has
proven many of them _ as well as the case _ not to be founded,''
said Block.
   Block said he could not speculate about the basis for her
accusation.
   Ms. Borunda was arrested June 25, accused of paying a gunman
$1,000 and promising an additional $1,500 after her fifth husband
had been killed during a staged break-in, Police Detective Dan
Hulbert said.
   The account of her arrest was published in the local paper the
same day as her happy-anniversary message to her husband, who was
identified as the intended victim.
   ``Happy fourth anniversary 6-29-88 to my wonderful husband Joe
Borunda,'' read the ad in the Herald-News of Joliet. ``I'll love
you always. Your wife Mary.''
   Borunda, 59, told police he had several life insurance policies
worth well over $100,000, Hulbert said.
   But Borunda, who earlier posted $1,000 bond to secure his wife's
release, did not believe she intended him any harm, Block said.
   Neither Ms. Borunda or her husband appeared in court Thursday,
the attorney said.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the striking Writers Guild
of America says television and film producers have informed the
union that contract talks will be broken off, but a spokesman for
the producers denies the allegation.
   The strike, in its 20th week, already has led to sweeping
layoffs in the entertainment industry and has shredded the fall
television schedule.
   Brian Walton, executive director of the WGA West, told a group
of reporters Thursday that the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers will not seek a contract agreement at a
bargaining session set for Saturday.
   Visibly upset, Walton declared he was ``nonplussed'' by the
alliance's decision, which he said was relayed to him Thursday
afternoon in a telephone call from alliance negotiator J. Nicholas
Counter III.
   Counter contradicted Walton's account of the conversation, but
Walton's version was corroborated by a second WGA executive, Mona
Mangan, who said she was a party to the call.
   According to Walton, Counter called the union to explain the
position the alliance will take in a negotiating session scheduled
for Saturday by federal mediator Leonard Farrell.
   The Saturday session was called by Farrell because full
bargaining teams have not met since June 16. The proposed contract
that arose from that session was rejected by the guild on June 22.
   The two sides are divided sharply on fees for reruns of one-hour
television programs shown in this country and for all programs
broadcast overseas.
   Walton reported that Counter said, ```No deal will be made.
There will be nothing there Saturday. Nothing will happen ... (and)
forces outside of the collective bargaining process will have to
resolve this.''
   Walton said he was so surprised by Counter's statement that he
called him back to confirm what he had said.
   ``We felt and do feel that we have been in good faith in
attempting to reach a deal,'' Walton told reporters at guild
headquarters.
   ``But throughout the last four to five months, there have been
weeks upon weeks where the alliance has simply refused to talk to
us.''
   Counter said that Walton's version was ``wrong ... I certainly
would not prejudge what would happen.''
   Meanwhile, CBS on Thursday announced four new fall series,
including a Dick Clark variety show, which either don't require
writers or come from abroad.
   Clark's show will contain specialty acts that require no
writers. On another show,``High Risk,'' people with adventuresome
jobs or hobbies tell their stories to the camera.
   The other shows are exempt from the Writers Guild because they
are made abroad. They are ``Dolphin Bay,'' a one-hour drama from
Australia and ``Jake's Journey,'' a half-hour comedy from England.

   This small town will finally honor one of
its most famous daughters, a barnyard belle whose profile is
well-known to generations of milk drinkers.
   Waterloo town fathers and the Seneca County Chamber of Commerce
planned today to unveil a sign on Route 96 reading simply:
``Waterloo, N.Y., Birthplace of Elsie the Cow _ 1932.'' A picture
of the famous bovine's face will also be revealed.
   Elsie, the symbol of Borden Dairy products since 1935, was born
on a farm in Waterloo in 1932, according to Dick Compo, chamber of
commerce president.
   Borden officials picked the jersey cow to be Elsie to satisfy
public demand for a real-life counterpart to a popular cartoon cow
in Borden advertisements.
   Elsie's advertised words soon became a popular Borden trademark.
   ``Dear Mom, I'm so excited I can barely chew,'' the celebrity
cow said. ``From now on I'm sending all my milk to Borden.''
   Compo said the sign was erected because ``Elsie is a community
asset.''
   Among those scheduled to attend today's unveiling was one of the
current Elsies, who is visiting the Seneca County Fair in Waterloo.

   A 19-year-old employee of the Arlington
Police Department who lacked the ``stable'' demeanor necessary for
the force has been retired.
   Rondo, a member of the department's four-horse mounted patrol
unit, ``just didn't have the right temperament,'' said Deputy
Police Chief Mike Johnston.
   Police work demands cool composure, but that wasn't Rondo's
style. So he will become the second horse to be retired from the
department and be returned to his owner. Another four-hoofed crime
stopper will replace him.
   Police also would like to replace Rondo with a darker-colored
horse to give the mounted patrol a more uniform look.
   ``We've had a few people approach us about donating horses to
the department,'' Johnston said. ``Right now, there's a glut of
horses because of the high cost of feeding them.''
   In three years of existence, Arlington's four mounted patrol
officers have become a familiar sight in shopping center parking
lots and some residential areas. They also spend their Friday and
Saturday nights riding herd over the city's teen-age cruisers,
Johnston said.
   ``They do their job,'' he said. ``They probably average three
arrests a month.''

if they order ``tako.''
   In Spanish, a taco is meat, beans or other filling folded into a
flat, cornmeal flapjack called a tortilla. In Japanese, tako is
octopus, most often served boiled, sliced and dipped in a sauce of
fermented bean curd.
   The Mexican-style fast food chain announced Thursday it had
become the latest American company trying to break into Asia's
biggest consumer market. The Southern California-based chain says
its first restaurant will open Monday in the city of Nagoya.
   Taco Bell, which has 2,700 outlets in the United States and has
ventured overseas to Canada, Guam, Puerto Rico and Britain, sees
the Land of the Rising Sun as a $4.5-billion-a-year fast food
market and plans to open more franchised and company-owned stores
there.

   Bolivia refused to send Roberto Suarez
Gomez to face drug trafficking charges in the United States, where
officials say he is the biggest cocaine producer in the world.
   Suarez Gomez, accused of peddling cocaine by the ton through a
vast global network, was behind bars today after police trudged
through a jungle to one of his five ranches and arrested him as he
slept.
   ``President Victor Paz Estenssoro says he is very pleased with
Suarez Gomez's arrest and that the fight against drugs is the top
priority of the government,'' Interior Minister Juan Carlos Duran
said told reporters Thursday.
   Duran said Bolivia will not extradite Suarez Gomez to the United
States because he was sentenced to 15 years in Bolivia this year.
But U.S. officials said they still will seek to have him brought to
trial in the United States.
   The arrest of the debonair 56-year-old Suarez Gomez, who also
has been accused of helping finance the bloody military coup that
overthrew the civilian government in 1980, was greeted with
jubilation.
   ``He's the biggest cocaine producer in the world. He has
enormous acreage in coca plants,'' said Chief Assistant U.S.
Attorney Richard Gregorie in Miami.
   Suarez Gomez was captured Wednesday by 10 narcotics officers who
trooped through tropical jungles all night and raided his El Sujo
ranch at dawn, Duran said. Two bodyguards also were arrested and 20
automatic weapons were seized.
   Suarez Gomez was flown to La Paz from Trinidad city, Duran said.
El Sujo, about 25 miles from Trinidad, is one of Suarez Gomez's
five ranches in the heart of the tropical Beni region in northeast
Bolivia.
   Until now, Suarez Gomez has used his money and influence to buy
his freedom in Bolivia. He publicly spoke of paying off political
figures and policemen.
   Suarez Gomez was tried in absentia in Bolivia this year on drug
trafficking charges and was sentenced to 15 years.
   Duran said Bolivia has no extradition treaty with the United
States, but U.S. drug officials said they would seek to try Suarez
Gomez on trafficking charges in the United States regardless.
   Gregorie said Thursday that an extradition request would be
entered immediately.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Jack Hook said in
Miami that Suarez Gomez was indicted in Miami in 1980 for
conspiracy to peddle 854 pounds of cocaine, but that Suarez Gomez
commonly deals in tons of cocaine.
   Hook noted that Carlos Lehder Rivas, leader of a group of drug
kingpins known as the Medellin Cartel, was sentenced in
Jacksonville, Fla., on Wednesday to life in prison without parole.
   ``I think the Carlos Lehder case goes to show countries that if
they arrest traffickers, here (in the United States) there are
jails that can hold them, there are courts that will try them and
most definitely will sentence them,'' he said.
   Suarez Gomez's son, Roberto Suarez Levy, was extradited from
Switzerland to Miami in 1981 on drug trafficking charges. He was
found innocent and after his release from a Miami jail was welcomed
as a hero in Bolivia.
   While independent of the Medellin Cartel, Suarez Gomez allegedly
associated with the Colombia-based organization on some
enterprises, said Hook. But his own smuggling ring was
self-contained.
   ``His operations consist of growing coca leaf, manufacturing
cocaine and shipping it to the United States,'' said Hook.
   ``He could be considered one of the pioneers involved in
growing, manufacturing and trafficking cocaine to the United
States,'' he said.
   The DEA says Suarez Gomez operated from one of his ranches.
Planes would fly cocaine paste from the Chapare region to the south
for processing at his labs before shipment to Colombia, the U.S.
drug agency alleges.
   In 1980, the Bolivan Human Rights Association says, Suarez Gomez
helped finance the military coup that overthrew the civilian
government of Lidia Gueiler Tejada, the interim president, and
installed a government that hired Italian, German and Argentine
mercenaries to undertake a campaign of terror.
   Under that right-wing government, headed by Gen. Luis Garcia
Meza, drug traffickers operated with impunity and left-wing
political figures and labor leaders were killed, tortured or exiled.
   The mercenaries went after opposition figures and provided
protection to traffickers. Human rights activists said Suarez Gomez
was the main player on behalf of cocaine traffickers.
   Estenssoro was elected in 1985, and the civilian government has
been tougher on drug trafficking than previous regimes. Last month,
the lower house of Bolivia's Congress accused cocaine kingpins of
trying to take over the government and called for a united front to
preserve democracy.

   A member of a nationalist Fijian group was
found shot to death today at his home, apparently after
accidentally firing a gun designed to look like a pen, a police
official said.
   Ratu Jone Veisamasama, 50, a prominent member of the Fijian
Taukei political group, was found slain at his farm in Colo-I-Suva,
about seven miles outside of Suva.
   He first was reported to have been shot by an assailant. But
police said at a news conference that he apparently shot himself
accidentally with a crudely made gun designed to look like a pen.
   ``No one could have shot him and escaped without being seen.
From this and other evidence it appears it was accidental and
self-inflicted,'' said Jimi Koroi, acting police commissioner.
   The Taukei nationalist movement promotes the supremacy of ethnic
Fijians over ethnic Indians, which outnumber Fijians among the
Pacific island nation's 715,000 people.
   The Taukei vigorously supported two military coups led by Brig.
Gen. Sitiveni Rabuka last year that toppled an Indian-dominated
government, suspended the constitution of the former British colony
and declared the islands a republic.

   A car bomb ripped through a Moslem
working class neighborhood near a Syrian checkpoint in west Beirut
today, killing seven people and wounding 47, police said.
   A yellow Mercedes-Benz packed with 33 pounds of TNT exploded
between a pharmacy and a gas station in the Cola district at 10:40
a.m. about 20 yards from a Syrian checkpoint, police said.
   They said most of the victims were Lebanese civilians from the
gas station and three adjacent high-rise apartment buildings that
were severely damaged.
   Syrian troops cordoned off the blast scene. They fired in the
air to clear traffic path for ambulances rushing victims to
hospitals, police said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing,
which appeared aimed at Syria's law-enforcing mission in the Moslem
sector of the Lebanese capital.
   The Syrians, who sent troops to west Beirut to quell fighting
among militias, maintain a military intelligence base near Afif
Tibi Street in the Cola district a few yards from the road
checkpoint.
   ``We have not been informed of any Syrian casualties,'' said a
police officer on the scene, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``I didn't see anything. I simply heard a huge explosion that
hurled me in the air and i felt my bones were broken when I landed
on the floor of my apartment,'' said Fatima Zirikli, a 35-year-old
Lebanese housewife.
   ``We saw something like lightening and then an ear-splitting
blast rained glass shards on us. We were flat on our bellies,''
said Ahmad Muti, an employee at the gas station.
   At least three Lebanese news photographers were roughed up by
the Syrians as they tried to shoot pictures of the wreckage.
   Reporters counted 19 parked cars destroyed, six of them gutted,
smoldering piles of twisted metal.
   It was the 10th car bombing in Lebanon this year and raised the
overall casualty toll in such attacks to 103 killed and 351 injured.
   The previous car bomb blew up in Christian east Beirut's
Ashrafiyeh residential district Monday, killing one civilian and
wounding another.
   Car bomb attacks are a by-product of Lebanon's 13-year-old civil
war between Moslems and Christian factions. The conflict has
claimed more than 130,000 lives since it broke out in 1975.

<HEAD>War Hero Buried With Military Honors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Medal of Honor winner Jake W. Lindsey,
whose heroism in World War II and the Korean War earned him the
nickname ``one-man army,'' was buried with military honors.
   Lindsey, who died of a heart attack Monday at age 67 at his home
in this southeast Mississippi town, was buried Thursday at
Whitehouse Cemetery.
   Lindsey was the 100th U.S. infantryman to receive the nation's
highest military honor. He won 16 medals in all, including four
Purple Hearts.
   He won the medal for an action in late 1944 in the Huertgen
Forest near Hamich, Germany. Lindsey, then a 24-year-old technical
sergeant, was part of a platoon that had been reduced from six men
from 40 in four days of fighting.
   The platoon captured its objective but faced an enemy
counterattack.
   Although wounded in the knee, Lindsey faced a German infantry
company backed by five tanks. He killed at least 20 Germans,
knocked out one of the tanks and then, after running out of
ammunition, used his bayonet in hand-to-hand combat.
   ``His unerringly accurate fire destroyed two enemy machine-gun
nests, forced the withdrawal of two tanks and effectively halted
the enemy flanking patrol,'' according to his citation, read by
Gen. George C. Marshall.
   When Lindsey was presented the medal before a joint session of
Congress in 1945, President Harry S. Truman was said to have
whispered to him: ``I'd rather have the Congressional Medal of
Honor than be the president of the United States.''
   During the Korean War, he single-handedly killed 150 Chinese
soldiers in one night, said Ron Busby, who is familiar with
Lindsey's exploits.
   Lindsey also taught Special Forces courses in hand-to-hand
combat and parachuting.
   After retiring from the military, he spent 10 years with the
U.S. Forest Service.
   The Isney, Ala., native spent most of his life in Waynesboro.
   Survivors include his wife, Lucille, two sons, two daughters and
a granddaughter.

<HEAD>Soviet Press Steps Up Attacks on Organizers of Armenia Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state-run press today branded organizers of
strikes in Armenia as narrow-minded provocateurs trying to seize
power, but some Armenians stayed away from work in a territorial
dispute with a neighboring republic.
   A producer for state-run television in Yerevan, the Armenian
capital, said most factories, stores and other businesses were open
but that some workers remained on strike. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But Ruzana Ambartsumyan, an Armenian activist in Yerevan, said
most factories were closed because of the strike, called to protest
the Soviet leadership's refusal to transfer the predominantly
Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan to Armenia in
the southern Soviet Union.
   There was no way to reconcile the conflicting reports about the
strike because authorities have barred foreign reporters from
traveling to the region since February, when Armenians began a
campaign to annex Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In the region itself, businesses remained closed because of a
walkout that began two months ago, said a worker for the state-run
radio station and a reporter for the official newspaper Soviet
Karabakh in Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Soviet television Thursday night showed trucks and buses
standing idle, construction sites empty and workers milling around
Stepanakert.
   In Moscow, the press stepped up its attacks on organizers of the
strike in Armenia.
   ``Formally, they are all intelligent people, well-educated. But
this is only formally. In reality, they are narrow-minded
nationalists, intellecutals without convictions, political
adventurers, hoping to make a career of provocations and
blackmail,'' a correspondent for the official news agency Tass
wrote in today's Trud newspaper.
   The article accused members of the group it said was organizing
the strike, the ``Karabakh Committee,'' of bringing the republic to
economic chaos and abusing Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policies of openness and democratization.
   It said the committee's ``prevailing idea is the seizure of
power in the republic'' by getting its members or supporters
elected to Communist Party and government posts.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, joined the attack,
quoting an Armenian law professor as saying provocations start at
the nightly outdoor rallies held in Yerevan.
   ``Extremist-minded elements excite people at the meetings, and
the microphone is given first to those who will not accept
compromises, those who need confrontation for any reason, and the
aggravation of an already tense situation,'' professor V. Nazaryan
was quoted as saying.
   Earlier media reports said two members of the Karabakh Committee
were arrested for bringing gasoline bombs to a rally.
   At a giant rally in Yerevan on Thursday night, several speakers
called on workers not already striking to do so as a protest
against Monday's ruling by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,
said Ambartsumyan, who attended the demonstration.
   The Presidium, the executive committee of the Soviet parliament,
decreed it would be unconstitutional to transfer Nagorno-Karabakh
to Armenia because Azerbaijan's government has refused to give its
consent. The region has been part of Azerbaijan for 65 years.
   Several speakers, including Armenian writer Sergo Khanzodyan,
blasted Gorbachev for not siding with the Armenians' demand,
according to Ambartsumyan and activist Igor Muradyan.
   Ambartsumyan said said people began shouting ``Free Ayrikyan!''
after a lawyer said authorities were violating the human rights of
Paruyr Ayrikyan, an Armenian nationalist. Tass said on Wednesday
that Ayrikyan, arrested March 25 and charged with defaming the
Soviet state, was being deported.

<TEXT>
   Alzheimer's disease may be caused in
some cases by an infectious agent, according to preliminary
findings by Yale University researchers.
   There is no known cause or cure for the disease.
   The researchers said it could take three to four more years to
confirm their initial observations, but they released the findings
to stimulate more research, Dr. Laura Manuelidis, a member of the
research team, said Thursday.
   ``We could be wrong. But then in the past, we have been right,''
she said.
   The study was reported in the July issue of the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.
   Alzheimer's is a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder
that mostly strikes people over 65 and has an estimated 2.5 million
American victims. Its symptoms include memory loss, impairment of
judgment, personality change and loss of language skills.
   The researchers said their findings suggest that some people may
become infected with Alzheimer's through infectious viral-like
agents similar to those that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a
less common form of dementia.
   The scientists based their hypothesis on a study of blood from
11 volunteers who had at least two relatives, siblings or parents,
with Alzheimer's.
   The reseachers found that the white blood cells from five of the
volunteers, one of whom has since developed clear signs of
Alzheimer's, produced brain lesions in hamsters similar to those
they had seen in rodents infected with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
   ``These transmission results raise the intriguing possibility
that CJD-like agents may be involved in at least some forms of
Alzheimer's disease,'' the report said.
   Previous attempts to transmit Alzheimer's to animals were
unsuccessful.
   Dr. Andrew Monjan, deputy associate director for neuroscience
and neuropsychology at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda,
Md., said it was premature to ``make any sort of statement that
there is an infectious etiology to Alzheimer's.''
   But, he said, ``If you are going to find an infectious agent,
you've got to look at an earlier stage of the disease. I would hope
that the paper would stimulate other investigators to pursue
similar lines.''

   A boat that gained notoriety last summer for
broadcasting rock music off the New York coast has been detained in
Boston Harbor by the U.S. Coast Guard as it was trying to reach
international waters.
   The 200-foot former fishing boat that housed the pirate station
Radio Newyork International was ordered back to port July 16 due to
a variety of operational and licensing problems, Coast Guard
spokesman Greg Creedon said Thursday.
   The boat, which was moving toward the edge of the harbor when it
was ordered to return, must install several on-board safety items
and obtain proper financial documents in case of a pollution
accident, Creedon said. The operators face a $25,000-a-day fine if
the boat is moved.
   Al Weiner, a spokesman for RNI, said he hopes to comply with the
Coast Guard orders and have the vessel on the seas later this
summer.
   The boat was seized by the Coast Guard about four miles off Long
Beach, N.Y., after about a week of RNI broadcasts last July. During
the seizure, the radio transmitter and other equipment were
damaged, Weiner said from his New York office on Thursday.
   Charges of operating an illegal station against Weiner and disc
jockey Ivan Rothstein were eventually dropped.
   They had said RNI was created to protest the conformity in New
York radio programming.
   The boat has been fitted with about $25,000 worth of radio and
nautical equipment, Weiner said, adding that he'd like to bring the
boat back off the coast of Long Island and create a format similar
to last year's program.

   Rescuers worked frantically today to locate more
than 100 people missing from a boat that sank after hitting a rock
in a southwest China river, an official report said today. It said
four people were killed.
   Sixteen crew members and 132 passengers were rescued after the
accident Thursday, China News Service said in a report appearing in
Hong Kong newspapers.
   The survivors included 129 men and 19 women, the news service
said in a report from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province,
about 930 miles southwest of Beijing. Six people required
hospitalization.
   Sichuan government officials were quoted in the report as saying
rescue work was difficult because the accident occurred in a remote
area and the river's tide was high.
   The boat was heading north from Yiban city to Leshan when it
struck the rock and sank at about 4:30 p.m. Thursday in Qianwei
County, about 116 miles south of Chengdu, the report said.
   The news service did not say how fast the boat was going and did
not give the depth or width of the river at the site of the
accident.
   Many people got on and off the passenger boat along the route,
making it difficult for officials to determine the exact number of
passengers on board when the vessel sank.
   The boat's capacity was 324 and initial estimates placed the
number of people on board at about 260, China News Service said.
The report said it was not clear if the boat was carrying
passengers from outside China.
   The Leshan Foreign Affairs Office, contacted by telephone from
Beijing, said that Sichuan Governor Zhang Haoru and Vice Governor
Ma Lin had gone to the scene but that no details were immediately
available.
   A Chongqing Central Shipping Administration official, also
reached by telephone from Beijing, said the boat belonged to the
Leshan branch of the Chongqing Shipping Co.
   He said the company had sent people to the scene, but because of
distance and poor communication they did not expect to have any
details until Saturday.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said 115 people were missing
and 131 people were rescued, including five crew members, and four
bodies were pulled from the Min River, a tributary of the Yangtze.
Soldiers and militiamen were continuing rescue efforts, it said in
a terse report.
   China's last major boat accident occurred in April 1987, when
two passenger ships collided in a dense fog on the Yangtze River in
Sichuan province, killing 18 people and injuring 21.

<TEXT>
   Thai officials predict their government will
reject a proposal that it lend sculptures to the Art Institute of
Chicago so Thailand can recover a historic temple relic it claims
was stolen.
   ``I am 90 percent certain of this,'' said Prince Subhadradis
Diskul, an expert in Thai art and archaeology who came to Chicago
to negotiate the return of the 900-year-old sculpture.
   The prince met with Art Institute officials Thursday, but left
without resolving the dispute that has sparked demonstrations in
Chicago and Bangkok.
   The relic at issue _ called a lintel, or crosspiece over a door
or window _ is titled ``Birth of Brahma With Reclining Vishnu On A
Makara.''
   The 2{-feet-long by 3-feet-wide lintel depicts the Hindu god
Vishnu reclining on water, and dates to Cambodia's Khmer dynasty
from 805-1250 A.D.
   It is the only important original piece missing from the 10-acre
Khmer temple of Phnom Rung in the northeastern Buri Ram province
near the Cambodian border.
   ``We will probably put a sign at the temple where the lintel
should be so tourists _ including Americans _ will know it was
taken, that we asked to give it back, and that they (the Art
Institute) would not,'' the prince added.
   Following a morning meeting, Art Institute officials proposed a
revolving-loan program that would bring to Chicago, for at least 10
years, ancient Thai sculptures of a comparable period and aesthetic
importance.
   ``The feeling of the people of Thailand is that it is stolen.
And they think that if it is stolen, we shouldn't have to send
anything in return,'' the prince said at a news conference.
   But the royal visitor, heading a delegation of Thai officials
and archeologists, promised to take the institute proposal back to
his government.
   Art Institute spokeswoman Eileen Harakal said the piece was
legally purchased by a dealer in Bangkok, who sold it to a New York
dealer, who finally sold it to the Alsdorf Foundation of Winnetka,
Ill.
   It was on loan to the Art Institute from 1967 until 1983, when
the foundation made it a gift, she said.

   President Alan Garcia spoke in support Thursday of the
Democratic Party platform regarding Latin America and said he
expects ``great dialogue'' between North and South America to
follow the U.S. presidential election.
   ``There are new winds blowing in the United States. I have read
the Democratic platform. It calls for non-confrontation with Latin
America and peaceful and harmonious relations,'' Garcia, a Social
Democrat, told 30 officials from across the continent meeting in
Lima to discuss Latin American cooperation.
   Garcia indicated a Democratic program would be positive for the
region.
   ``The Democratic platform speaks of economic cooperation and
mentions the foreign debt. Whatever the election result, we will
have a new situation in a few months. I think 1989 could be a year
of great dialogue,'' said Garcia, who has frequently charged that
the policies of the United States and other industrialized
countries toward Latin America are imperialistic.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's leader, Nguyen Van Linh, says
all Vietnamese troops will leave Cambodia by early 1990 at the
latest instead of the end of 1990 as previously announced.
   Linh made the statement in a meeting in Moscow on Thursday with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, according to an official
Vietnam News Agency report monitored today in Bangkok.
   Soviet-supplied Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in late 1978,
installed a pro-Vietnamese government and are battling three major
guerrilla groups.
   The agency said Linh told Gorbachev that all Vietnamese troops
``will be withdrawn by the end of 1989 or early 1990 at the latest,
and that the schedule for the troop pullout will be updated if an
early solution is reached.''
   Vietnam says it is withdrawing 50,000 troops, or half its force
in Cambodia, this year. It says its military command was withdrawn
on June 30 and that the running of the war was turned over to the
Cambodian government.
   The Vietnamese report quoted Linh and Gorbachev as saying they
would strive to create favorable conditions for a settlement and
stated that China could contribute to a settlement. China arms the
guerrillas.
   They also stressed the importance of talks beginning Monday in
Bogor, Indonesia, that would for the first time bring together all
the warring factions in Cambodia. Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach is scheduled to attend the talks.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor, New York Mayor
Edward I. Koch and hundreds of other pilgrims gathered in the stark
boglands of western Ireland today to begin a campaign of prayer for
peace in Northern Ireland.
   ``I hope to do nothing but be a pilgrim. I hope to do nothing
but pray,'' O'Connor, who heads the New York's Roman Catholic
archdiocese, said at the airport. He said he would not get involved
in political issues.
   Koch, however, repeated his belief that the British should
``ultimately'' get out of Northern Ireland and said the government
should release a report on police violence in the province.
   Koch joined the pilgrims at the airport following a visit to the
Netherlands, where he offended some officials by suggesting drug
enforcement efforts were lax.
   He embraced O'Connor, who kidded him, ``You're all over the
papers'' _ a reference to a photograph of Koch pouring a pint of
ale in a Dublin pub.
   ``I've frequently been told the mayor is going to Ireland and
taking me along,'' O'Connor joked.
   The pilgrims were drawn to this village by the Shrine of Our
Lady of Knock, which commemorates the evening in 1879 when 15
townsfolk said they saw a vision of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Pope
John Paul II visited the shrine in 1979.
   Some skeptics have argued that a pilgrimage composed mostly of
Catholics will succeed only in threatening Northern Ireland's
Protestants, but several pilgrims said prayer deserved a chance.
   ``Ireland has been suffering for hundreds of years, and the
problems don't seem to have been solved by any other means,'' said
Agnes McShane, of Hastings-On-Hudson, N.Y. ``(English poet William)
Wordsworth said, `More things are wrought by prayer than this world
dreams.' ''
   After three days at Knock, O'Connor will visit Belfast and
Armagh in Northern Ireland and conclude the pilgrimage with two
days in Dublin.
   At least 2,646 people have died since sectarian violence began
in August 1969 in Northern Ireland, where the predominantly
Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to unite the province
with the Irish Republic.
   When he announced the pilgrimage on St. Patrick's Day after
three Catholics were killed a Protestant gunman rampaging through a
Belfast cemetery, O'Connor called for 100,000 participants and said
prayer had been neglected as an instrument of peace in Northern
Ireland.
   The number was then scaled down to 1,500, but only 350 signed up.
   Still, more than 20,000 people, including many American tourists
already in Ireland, are expected to join prayers at the shrine on
Saturday.
   Dan Kelly, a telephone company employee from Garnerville, N.Y.,
said he came to Knock to pray for peace.
   ``It might call more attention to the problem in the States,''
he said. ``I think that's what Ireland needs _ more attention from
the people in the States.''
   Jim Higgins, the Knock area's lawmaker in the Dail, or
parliament, wished the mission would produce a miracle, ``because
at this juncture it will require almost divine intervention to
resolve the problems of the north.''
   Higgins, a Catholic representing the opposition Fine Gael party,
said the mission should persuade Americans of ``the futility'' of
the IRA's guerrilla war.
   The IRA is outlawed on both sides of the border. In Belfast, its
legal political wing, Sinn Fein, said the group had asked to meet
its leader Gerry Adams.

<TEXT>
   British investigators say they will interview
witnesses to World War II atrocities in their search for evidence
against more than 100 Britons suspected of Nazi war crimes.
   Sir Thomas Hetherington, a member of a British inquiry team that
arrived this week, told reporters the team will focus on the
Ukraine and on the Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia, which
Nazi forces occupied after attacking the Soviet Union in June 1941.
   The investigators will question people who witnessed murder,
manslaughter and genocide under the Nazis, he said Thursday.
   British Home Secretary Douglas Hurd established the commission
in February to decide whether enough evidence could be gathered to
pursue criminal prosecution of British citizens or residents
accused of war crimes.
   If such evidence can be assembled, Hurd told Parliament, he will
ask the body to change British law to allow prosecution for crimes
committed outside the country.
   Canada has passed a similar law, and Australia is considering
one, Hetherington said. The United States can prosecute suspected
war criminals only for violating immigration laws.
   The Soviet prosecutor's office has given the team lists of
suspected war criminals who are believed to be living in Britain,
Hetherington said. Other names and evidence have come from two
Holocaust research centers, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles and the Yad Vashem Memorial in Jerusalem.
   The team compiled a list of 250 suspected war criminals but has
trimmed it to 110 after reviewing evidence, Hetherington told
reporters at the British Embassy.
   The first witnesses will be interviewed Sept. 26 in Lithuania,
said another investigator, William Chalmers.
   Chalmers and Hetherington said Soviet authorities had been
helpful in providing information about the suspects and arranging
interviews.
   Hetherington, Britain's former director of public prosecutions,
said there was no evidence the British government hid the
identities of the suspects after the war.
   Asked why it took more than 40 years for Britain to investigate
the suspects, he replied: ``It's only in the last few years this
sort of thing has been an issue. ''
   He said the team hoped to present its recommendations to Hurd
next summer.

   Gunmen believed to be Sikh militants
killed 11 people, including eight Sikhs, in northern Punjab state,
the United News of India said today.
   The victims' bodies were found in an area about 25 miles east of
the city of Amritsar, the news agency said.
   Five Nihangs, members of a Sikh fundamentalist sect, were shot
and killed on a highway near the town of Mehta Chowk, the news
agency said. Three Sikhs, including two women, were gunned down in
the nearby village of Shero Padha.
   Three unidentified bodies were found in Chogowan, another
village nearby, the agency said. The report said the killings
occurred Thursday.
   The killings raise to 1,544 the number of deaths in Punjab this
year blamed on Sikh militants, who are fighting for an independent
homeland in the state.
   The militants have killed at least 685 fellow Sikhs in their
violent campaign. Moderate Sikhs often are targets of the violence.
   Sikhs only 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are a
majority in Punjab. Sikh radicals claim discrimination by the Hindu
majority.

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered soul singer James Brown
to hold a benefit concert for police and abused children as part of
a sentence on drug and weapons charges.
   The 55-year-old Godfather of Soul pleaded guilty Thursday to
resisting arrest and carrying a pistol. He pleaded no contest to
possession of the drug PCP.
   Circuit Judge James E. Moore fined Brown $1,200 and placed him
on probation until he performs a concert to benefit the local
chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police and Helping Hands, a
private organization for abused children.
   No concert date has been set.
   ``This is a back-door way of getting me to do a concert,'' Brown
said after the sentencing. ``I would have done a concert for the
children anyway. ... I would have done it gladly, but they didn't
have to arrest me.''
   But he added, ``I just thank God I was able to get out of here.''
   The singer could have received up to 2{ years in jail and $3,000
in fines on the charges.
   ``It's better than placing him on the streets to do community
service,'' said prosecutor Bob Harte. ``A concert is something he
can do that no one else could.''

   The fighting broke out Thursday in the port city of Chittagong

   Police fired tear gas shells and charged with canes to disperse

   It got hotter than usual during a male dancer's
act when ``flash paper'' he was using started a fire and sent
people fleeing.
   Eighteen dancers, 10 employees and 75 patrons in the women-only
La Bare nightclub escaped without injury Thursday night, said
manager Keith Narducci.
   Witnesses said the dancer, who worked under the name Eagle, had
tossed a flash-paper cigarette toward the ceiling during his act.
The blaze spread across the entire ceiling in about 15 seconds,
they said.
   ``They kept playing music and the guy kept dancing. Then when he
started pointing at it (the ceiling), I said, `Hey, something's
wrong here,' but they never said there was a fire,'' an
unidentified patron told the Dallas Morning News. ``I just think it
stinks.''
   The blaze caused an estimated $100,000 to the nightclub and
$20,000 damage to a pizza restaurant, fire officials said.
   Flammable flash paper often is used by magicians and other
performers to produce bursts of fire.
   Eagle told the newspaper that when the club is rebuilt, he will
continue to use flash paper. ``We'll be a little more careful next
time,'' he said.

   Neverending Battle Inc., a non-profit group
that was founded to build a Superman museum and statue, is nearly
$200,000 in debt and is considering filing for bankruptcy, its
president says.
   ``We're attempting to file in such a way that our creditors can
receive maximum benefit,'' said Tony Isabella, a comic-book store
owner and president of Neverending Battle.
   The group lost about $100,000 on last month's International
Superman Exposition, which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the
creation of Superman by Clevelanders Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster,
and $60,000 on last year's benefit premiere of ``Superman IV'' in
Cleveland, Isabella said.
   Fewer than 10,000 people attended the convention, which
organizers had expected to draw about 30,000 Superman fans.
Isabella said about 300 people attended a $250-a-plate dinner that
was part of the convention, but not all paid for their tickets.
   ``I think a lot of deals were cut for advertisers,'' he said.
   Trustees earlier this month closed the downtown office of
Neverending Battle, accepted the resignation of its general
manager, Alan Hills, and fired spokesman Tim Gorman, the group's
founder and former president.

   American Honda Motor Co. announced today it is
recalling about 280,000 1984 and 1985 Civics to correct a fuel pump
that could leak and catch fire.
   High under-hood temperatures and internal pressure could cause
fuel to leak between the two pump halves, the automaker said in a
statement from its Gardena, Calif., headquarters.
   No injuries stemming from the defect have been reported, Honda
said.
   The automaker said it will notify owners that Honda dealers will
replace the pump for free.

<HEAD>U.S. Ordered To Honor Settlement with Family of Quadriplegic Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered the government to honor a
settlement made with a couple whose baby was born severely
handicapped at a military hospital, even though the child has died.
   ``One must expect that the moral fibers of our nation _ honor,
integrity and commitment _ will be reflected as a model to our
citizens,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas E. Scott said in the ruling.
   Lavern Reed, who was with the Coast Guard, sued the government
in 1986, alleging that negligence during his son's delivery at
Homestead Air Force Base hospital resulted in the child being born
quadriplegic, deaf, blind and brain-damaged.
   The hospital and government never admitted negligence and were
not found liable. However, the government negotiated a settlement
with the family to provide for Benjamin's long-term medical care
and compensation for the family.
   The Reeds said the government reneged when their 16-month-old
died just after the $2 million settlement was reached.
   Government officials called and said, ``He's dead _ now you
don't need the money,'' said Linda Reed, who lives with her husband
in Ilwaco, Wash.
   The government argued it didn't owe the money because there was
never a binding agreement and because no court approved the
settlement before Benjamin died.
   The settlement had included a $700,000 medical trust fund, with
the unused portion to go back to the government when Benjamin died,
said the Reed's attorney, Ira Leesfield.
   Under Scott's ruling, issued Monday, the family will receive the
remaining $1.3 million, which was a guaranteed settlement for the
parents.
   ``The government has wholly failed its people by not upholding
these deeply rooted ideals in this case,'' the judge said. ``The
government, more than any other party, must be held to honor its
commitments.''

<TEXT>
   Financier Victor Posner is being sued
over a series of Norman Rockwell portraits of steelworkers
commissioned by Sharon Steel Corp.
   Rockwell was 72 and nearing the end of his career when Sharon
Steel paid him $50,000 in 1966 to do 14 illustrations. Rockwell,
who died in 1978, was best known for his folksy Saturday Evening
Post covers.
   Bankruptcy trustee James Toren discovered the Rockwells missing
when he began counting corporate assets for Sharon Steel, which
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1987.
   Posner, who added Sharon Steel to a rapidly growing list of
companies that vaulted him into the Forbes magazine list of 400
wealthiest Americans, had moved the paintings to his Miami Beach
headquarters in 1969.
   On April 27, Toren wrote to Posner asking for the paintings,
said to be worth up to $350,000. He is still waiting for an answer.
On June 3, he sued Posner in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Erie, Pa.,
demanding the paintings.
   ``I don't know where they are,'' said Renee Motram-Doss,
Posner's aide. ``To this minute, I am unaware of the exact charge
or the exact location of the illustrations.''
   Toren also claimed this week that Posner paid himself $16.1
million in unjustified and excessive salaries from Sharon between
1983 to 1987.
   Posner in February pleaded no contest to income tax fraud for
allegedly inflating the value of a land donation. He was sentenced
to finance a $3 million program to study homelessness and work as a
volunteer at a soup kitchen.

   More than 70 percent of West
Germans questioned in a survey approve of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, and 41 percent approve of President Reagan, according to
results released today.
   Another poll indicated that West German mistrust of the Warsaw
Pact has ``dropped dramatically,'' the respected Allensbach
Institute said.
   The Allensbach poll said that of about 2,000 West Germans
queried in late May and early June, 71 percent had a ``favorable
opinion'' of Gorbachev compared with 41 percent for Reagan.
   ``General Secretary Gorbachev has exceeded a popularity rating
of 70 percent, something that normally only federal presidents have
accomplished in the federal republic (West Germany),'' institute
director Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann wrote.
   Results of the poll regarding mistrust of the Warsaw Pact also
were released today.
   In a commentary explaining those results, Noelle-Neumann said:
``The mistrust towards the Soviet Bloc has dropped dramatically
since Gorbachev has been at the helm.''
   At the start of the decade, 58 percent of West Germans expressed
mistrust of the Soviet bloc compared with 25 percent in the latest
survey, according to Allensbach. The latest poll was conducted in
January and involved about 2,000 people.
   The institute said those polled included people over 16
throughout West Germany and in West Berlin. It did not release a
margin of error for the results.
   The poll results are in line with indicators that many West
Germans believe a positive trend in East-West relations will
continue.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a news conference Thursday that his
Moscow summit in October will make improved East-West ties
``irreversible.''
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz favors a ``direct dialogue''
between West German and Soviet military officials on defense
matters, according to an interview published Thursday in the
Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper of Hanover and the Tagesspiegel of
West Berlin.
   A growing number of West German companies are seeking business
with the Soviets.
   Kohl on Thursday made clear he will use his Kremlin trip to
cement better East-West ties.
   ``I want to make sure that the favorable tendencies we now see
in East-West relations are irreversible,'' Kohl told reporters.
   West Germans hope that improved ties between Washington and
Moscow will eventually result in better relations with Communist
East Germany.

   Lina Grumette, the ``chess mother'' to the
enigmatic Bobby Fischer when he prepared for his 1972 world
championship, has died at age 80.
   Mrs. Grumette, who kept Fischer, then the ``enfant terrible'' of
international chess, at her home for months at a time as he
prepared for the championship, died Thursday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center of complications of lung cancer.
   One of the best women chess players of the 1940s, she encouraged
Fischer to seek the championship from Soviet grandmaster Boris
Spassky and accompanied him to Iceland for the match. It was there
he became the only American to win a world chess title.
   Fischer, now a recluse believed to be living in Southern
California, has refused to play in public since.
   For many years, Mrs. Grumette ran a club in her home called The
Chess Set. It became a gathering place for tournament players and
other chess celebrities.
   For several years she also hosted the largest Memorial Day chess
tournament on the West Coast.
   She is survived by a son, a daughter and a grandson.
   A funeral will be held Sunday.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prison riot that left 10 convicts dead
began as an escape attempt by four inmates who bribed a guard to
get them weapons, authorities said.
   Twenty people were injured in the riot Wednesday at a
penitentiary in Morelia, 150 miles west of Mexico City, the
Michoacan state attorney general's office said.
   Genovevo Figueroa, state public security director in Michoacan,
said Thursday that of the 20 injured, 13 were convicts and seven
were guards. All the injuries were minor, he said.
   About 2,000 inmates are housed at the prison, many for drug
trafficking, bank robbery and homicide.
   Figueroa's office said it was investigating possible complicity
by people on the outside.
   A statement released Thursday night by state Attorney General
Jose Franco Villa's office said four prisoners paid about $1,080
for two 9mm pistols from a guard. It identified the guard as Jorge
Moreno Zarate.
   A spokesman for the attorney general, Isauro Gutierrez, said
Morteno Zarate resigned at the beginning of the month but was a
guard when he allegedly obtained the firearms.
   Authorities were looking for Zarate, Gutierrez said.
   The statement said three of the four inmates who sparked the
riot were serving sentences for drug trafficking and the fourth was
convicted of bank robbery.
   The four were joined by another inmate who helped wrest an M-1
assault rifle from a guard and by a sixth prisoner who made a
firebomb using a soft drink bottle, the statement said.
   It said the four planned to escape July 6, assuming that on the
day of Mexico's national elections, security would be lax. But when
they saw security was normal, they postponed their plans, the
statement said.
   The riot began at 9:45 a.m. Wednesday when prisoners being led
to trial disarmed five guards and a police officer, Franco Villa
told reporters.
   He said other prisoners took advantage of the presence of ``a
considerable number of (visiting) relatives and friends of the
prisoners'' to disarm more guards.
   ``With these new arms, others intensified the aggression against
security elements,'' he said.
   He said the prisoners hurled a firebomb into administrative
offices, destroying virtually all files on pending court cases in
six courtrooms.
   Other inmates exchanged gunfire with watchtower guards before
the riot was brought under control, he said.
   Police captured five inmates outside the penitentiary, Franco
Villa said.
   The attorney general denied an earlier report that prisoners
held 15 secretaries and eight nurses hostage.

   The Democratic Party did just that _ party _ well
into the morning as delegates, journalists, party faithful and
hangers on marked the end of the Democratic National Convention.
   At the Georgia World Congress Center, the massive convention
facility next door to the convention hall, thousands danced into
the early hours at a ``Victory '88'' party.
   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis and his running mate Lloyd
Bentsen received thunderous applause from a crowd when they walked
across the street to the giant bash.
   ``This has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a
great Democratic victory in November of 1988,'' Dukakis told the
throng.
   When he completed his five minutes of impromptu remarks, an
orchestra started playing Greek tunes and Dukakis danced two or
three steps, setting off wild cheers.
   While the house band from a posh local nightspot played Motown
and rock, several delegates danced with big state-name signs from
the convention floor.
   Ben Jones, a former TV actor _ ``The Dukes of Hazzard'' _ and
now a Democratic candidate for Congress from Georgia, bounded out
of the World Congress Center with the Georgia sign about 1:30 a.m.
   He said he planned to present the sign to Bobby Kahn, head of
Atlanta '88, the convention planning committee.
   Across downtown at the New Georgia Railroad depot _ not a new
depot at all, but an old depot refurbished by the state _ some
1,200 attended a ``Boston to Austin'' party for the Massachusetts
and Texas delegations, members of Congress, and many other invited
guests.
   The menu: oysters and shrimp for Boston, fajitas and hot sauce
for Austin. At the bar: Samuel Adams Boston Lager and Lone Star
Beer, plus Cape Cod cocktails, margaritas and other drinks.
   Cost of the bash, thrown by Ocean Spray of Plymouth, Mass., and
the Enron Corp. of Houston: ``About 50,'' said public relations
spokesman Roy Meyers.
   He meant thousand.
   Entertainment was provided by The Fabulous Thunderbirds, an
uptempo rock-blues band from Texas. ``We play these things every
once in a while,'' said lead singer Kim Wilson. ``We kind of
represent the state in a way.''
   Wilson, however, didn't want to represent who he was voting for.
``One of the nice things about voting is you do it in secret,'' he
said, although he would concede that the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket
``looks good to me.''
   Jesse Jackson's supporters partied Thursday night at their
headquarters hotel.
   ``I will do whatever Jesse says do,'' said Walter Dale, a
campaign worker from Chicago. ``If he says vote for (Republican
George) Bush, we'll do it.''

<HEAD>John Hersey Apologizes For Not Crediting Another Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Hersey has
acknowledged appropriating another writer's facts and phrases
without attribution for a New Yorker article on novelist James Agee
and offered an apology.
   The flap developed after Laurence Bergreen, author of ``James
Agee: A Life,'' noticed as many as 20 parallel passages in Hersey's
article about Agee in the magazine's July 18 issue, The New York
Times said today.
   ``It seemed to me that once you got beyond the opening anecdote
in which he (Hersey) described his meeting with Agee that the whole
article was a condensation of my biography,'' Bergreen told the
newspaper.
   Bergreen said he contacted his lawyer after he learned the
Hersey article was going to be reprinted this fall by Houghton
Mifflin as the preface to a new edition of Agee's ``Let Us Now
Praise Famous Men.''
   Agee, a critic, novelist, journalist and screenwriter, died in
1955.
   Hersey, who won the Pulitzer for fiction in 1945 with his ``A
Bell for Adano,'' told the Times in a telephone interview from his
Massachusetts home at Martha's Vineyard, ``Where I quoted directly,
I gave credit.
   ``But since Mr. Bergreen's biography is the most comprehensive
so far published, I should have given him some direct credit, and
that I will now do.''
   Hersey said he did not think he made a big mistake. ``I'm very
sorry if I've offended Mr. Bergreen. I don't believe my real
offense in terms of normal practice is great,'' he said.
   ``There's always a fine line between facts and the work of
another writer,'' said Hersey, who is the author of numerous
articles and more than 20 books including ``Hiroshima,'' which
filled an entire issue of The New Yorker in 1946.
   Bergreen's other works include ``Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise
of Network Broadcasting.'' He is also working on a biography of
Irving Berlin.

<TEXT>
   Jimmy Swaggart's first revival outside his
home state since he was defrocked in a sex scandal begins tonight,
causing painful questions of loyalty for some fellow evangelists.
   ``It's a very awkward situation and to some degree
embarrassing,'' said the Rev. H.P. Vibbert, pastor of Abundant Life
Memorial church, who has been a friend of Swaggart since the 1960s.
``To have a fellow minister come to the city and conduct such a
crusade and not even be able to support it.''
   Swaggart's crusade, which ends Sunday, is his first outside
Louisiana since the fiery TV evangelist was dismissed April 8 by
the Assemblies of God for refusing to abide by punishment imposed
by the church for moral wrongdoing.
   In February, Swaggart tearfully confessed to a TV audience that
he had committed an unspecified sin against God and his family.
Debra Murphree, a prostitute, later said Swaggart had hired her to
pose nude and once had sex with her.
   The Assemblies of God ordered Swaggart to refrain from preaching
for a year, but Swaggart returned to the pulpit after three months,
saying his multimillion-dollar global ministry could not survive
the suspension.
   The Rev. Mike Baldock, pastor of the independent New Covenant
Church and organizer of the crusade here, has said he believes
about 8,000 people will attend each of the three meetings this
weekend.
   Baldock said he has had no trouble recruiting more than 500
volunteers, 200 ushers and a security force.
   Juleen Turnage, a spokeswoman at Assemblies of God headquarters
in Springfield, Mo., said individual pastors must decide whether to
support the crusade.
   Officials of the Northwest Assembly of God Church here decided
not to cooperate in any way, said Lucille Sexton, an aide to the
Rev. Blanche Fiscus. Pastors have been instructed to have nothing
to do with Swaggart's activities here, she added.
   ``I choose not to go simply for the awkwardness of being
there,'' Vibbert said. ``If I were there, I would feel I ought to
be with him on the platform, so I choose not to go.
   ``My human instinct would be to go down and stand behind him and
support him. But as an Assembly of God pastor I cannot cooperate
with the crusade without contradicting the directions of the
executive presbytery.''
   Vibbert has been neutral on the issue with his congregation,
neither encouraging nor discouraging attendance.
   As for Swaggart, Vibbert said, ``We're still friends. That
relationship, as far as I'm concerned, has not been severed. We're
praying for Jimmy.''

   Victims of soccer riots that killed 39
people in 1985 have sued the mayor of Brussels and three other
people, the prosecutor's office said today.
   Lawsuits filed Wednesday also name the city of Brussels and the
European Soccer Union, an office spokesman said.
   Twenty-six Britons were charged with first-degree responsibility
in the riots at Heysel Stadium in Brussels in May 1985. The
violence broke out during the final match of the European Cup
championship between English and Italian teams.
   Those charged are to go on trial Oct. 17. Three Belgian
officials have been accused of deadly neglect.
   The new suits name Brussels Mayor Herve Brouhon; Viviane Baro,
deputy mayor in charge of sports; Jacques Georges, president of the
European Soccer Union; and Hans Bangerter, secretary general of the
union, said the office spokesman. He spoke on condition of
anonymity in keeping with office rules.
   More than 100 supporters of the Italian soccer club Juventus
Turin who survived the riots and relatives of the victims filed the
new suits, he said. They are claiming damages of $12,900 to
$385,000 per person.

   The death toll from floods in the Hiroshima area of

more bodies, police said.
   Hiroshima police said two people were missing and might be
buried under the muddy debris of landslides triggered by torrential
rain Thursday.
   A local weather bureau official said up to seven inches of rain
pelted the northern area of Hiroshima prefecture during a six-hour
period early Thursday.
   Police said landslides occurred at 66 places, and 887 houses
were flooded. The towns of Kake and Uchikuroyama, about 440 miles
southwest of Tokyo, were hit hardest, they said.

   Mormon Church officials must disclose
whether a member confessed to molesting children years before his
arrest, an appeals court ruled.
   The ruling Thursday came in a lawsuit filed against the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints by the mother of a child the
church member admitted molesting.
   The suit claims Kenneth Ray told three bishops as early as 1968
that he had been having sexual contact with children. The suit said
the church failed to report Ray to state authorities until 1984,
leaving children vulnerable to abuse.
   Ray was excommunicated by the church in 1984 for conduct
unbecoming a member and later pleaded no contest to child molesting.
   Cynthia Brown, who sued Ray, Ray's former wife and the Mormon
Church seeking unspecified damages on her daughter's behalf, sought
to force the bishops to disclose whether Ray told them he had been
sexually abusing children.
   The church objected, saying the bishops were protected by the
clergyman-penitent privilege.
   Superior Court Judge Cheryl Hendrix ordered the bishops to give
depositions, and the Arizona Court of Appeals agreed Thursday.
   The appellate court, in a 3-0 decision, said Ray had waived his
privilege by disclosing to police what he had told the bishops.
   A Mormon Church official in Mesa, David Udall, declined comment
on the ruling, saying he had not read it.

   Police raided a marijuana-growing operation in a

Berghmans said Thursday.
   During a raid Wednesday night, police found 2,500 marijuana
plants in the 20,000-square-foot warehouse. Officer Dan Fordice
estimated the operation could produce four crops a year or about
10,000 plants, each worth an estimated $3,000 at maturity.
   No one was found in the building and no arrests were made,
Fordice said.
   The leased building was divided into 10 rooms, each containing
numerous planter boxes with six to eight plants per box and
automatic lighting, fertilizing and venting, police said.
   One room contained two huge vats of liquid fertilizer that was
fed to plants through tubes running to the individual rooms with
automatic timers to control the flow to each plant.
   Fordice said police learned of the operation through a tipster.
A check of power records indicated unusually high electricity
consumption at the warehouse began last November, suggesting the
operation may have begun then, he said.

   A bus crossing a flooded ravine was
swept off a bridge during heavy rains, and as many as 71 people
were killed, police said today.
   The accident occurred Thursday in the eastern province of
Punjab, about 20 miles southeast of Islamabad. Police said the bus
was crammed with passengers, some riding on the luggage rack on top.
   Nine people were rescued and 18 bodies were recovered, police
said.
   The police chief of the nearby village of Kahuta, Riaz Hussain
Shah, said the bus became trapped in flood waters as it crossed the
bridge and was swept away by the current.
   Witnesses said passengers jumped into the water but were swept
away by the current.
   The police chief said the army was called in to help with rescue
operations.
   The bus was believed to be ferrying about 80 people between
Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, and Rawal Kot, about 60 miles away.

   One of two Lumbee Indians accused of taking
up to 20 hostages at a newspaper office Feb. 1 says he will be a
write-in candidate for governor.
   ``This campaign shall be one of protest and one seeking justice
for Indians, blacks and for whites _ a protest aimed directly and
wholeheartedly at the regime that now controls the lives of so many
honest, justice-seeking people,'' Eddie Hatcher said Thursday.
   Hatcher faces federal charges of taking hostages and
manufacturing illegal weapons. He is free on bail while awaiting
trial.
   The 10-hour hostage siege in Lumberton Feb. 1 ended peacefully
after Gov. Jim Martin agreed to form a task force to investigate
charges of corruption and drug trafficking by Robeson County law
enforcement agencies and other officials.
   Martin, a Republican, is seeking re-election. He faces
Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Jordan.
   No North Carolina governor or U.S. senator has ever been elected
in a write-in campaign, said Alex Brock, director of the state
Board of Elections.

   The first showroom-bound cars off the
assembly line at Toyota's first wholly-owned American plant will be
one of three colors _ red, white or blue. But the automaker says
it's mere coincidence.
   Commercial production of the 1989 Camry started on schedule at
the plant July 11, two years after ground was broken, said D.
Michael Dodge, plant general manager.
   The first cars were white, the easiest color to apply because
the paint is non-metallic. White also is popular with customers,
Dodge said.
   This week, the plant began making dark red cars. It will add
dark blue in two weeks, he said, and follow that with black and
dark gray.
   Later, Toyota will produce more difficult colors that will be
offered on Camrys for the first time this fall. There will be nine
colors in all.
   The Camrys go on sale in October, said Debra Sanchez, a
spokeswoman for Toyota Motor Sales in California.
   The plant is now producing 19 cars a day. It will reach 40 cars
a day by the end of August and turn out 17,000 to 20,000 by the end
of the year, Dodge said. Eventually production will reach 200,000
Camrys a year.
   The plant now employs 1,345 people, with an eventual workforce
of 3,000 in the assembly plant and 500 more in an engine plant yet
to be built.

   Suffolk County's new first-in-the-nation
law regulating the use of video display terminals in the workplace
is superseded by state and federal law and is unconstitutional, a
lawsuit claims.
   The law affects all companies in the Long Island county with 20
or more of the computer terminals and with operators who spend at
least 20 hours a week working on them.
   The law, which took effect Monday, requires employers to provide
work breaks, eye care and eyeglass benefits, and special furniture
and lighting.
   Gary Sazer, representing the four companies that filed the suit
in state court Thursday, said state and federal law have provisions
for controlling hazards in the workplace, ensuring consistent
legislation throughout the state.
   The suit also claims that the law violates constitutional rights
against unlawful searches because it authorizes county officials to
inspect private offices without a warrant to ensure compliance.
   The federal Occupational and Safety Health Administration is
studying VDTs in the workplace to determine if regulation is
needed, he said.
   The four companies suing were ILC Data Device Corp. of Bohemia,
Lumex Inc. of Bay Shore, and Micra Corp. and Digital Data Systems
Inc., both of Hauppauge.

<HEAD>Pravda Publishes Briton's Letter To Sakharov</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda today
published a letter from a Briton who urged Nobel Peace laureate
Andrei Sakharov to condemn what he called lack of freedom and human
rights in Britain and the United States.
   Tom Hewson urged Sakharov to appeal to Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and President Reagan on behalf of victims of real estate
development and those who cannot afford health care.
   ``Following your public plea for certain freedoms ... I wish to
suggest that you also make as impassioned appeals to both Mrs.
Thatcher and President Reagan about the appalling lack of freedom
and human rights in America and the United Kingdom,'' Hewson wrote.
   He referred to a June 3 news conference by Sakharov that he saw
on British television.
   Sakharov could not be reached for comment on the letter.
Telephone calls to his home went unanswered.
   Hewson, 72, was interviewed by The Associated Press in London
from his home in Maidstone, Kent, and read the original English
version of the letter.
   He said he is a retired businessman with three children who saw
the news conference in which Sakharov told reporters that Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had not yet guaranteed human rights.
Sakharov also called for the release of political prisoners.
   ``I do not belong to any political party. I'm just a
straightforward individual who feels that the Russian people ought
to know that the ordinary people in this country are being hard
done by,'' Hewson told the AP.
   ``When I saw Sakharov complaining in Russia..., I thought it was
time somebody balanced the thing up and let the Russian people know
about conditions in England.''
   Hewson suggested Sakharov take on the causes of families evicted
from the Isle of Dogs, a partially derelict industrial and dockside
piece of real estate in London being developed for high-tech
businesses and residences.
   Hewson also said that that newborn babies are dying in Britain
because of a lack of money for heart operations and that American
hospitals refuse to treat the seriously ill for lack of health
insurance. He asked Sakharov to protest that.
   Sakharov, Hewson wrote, should also protest evictions of
unemployed Americans and Britons from their homes for not paying
mortgages.
   Sakharov, a physicist and leading Soviet human rights activist,
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. He spent seven years in internal
exile and was freed in December 1986.
   Hewson said he was surprised Pravda published his letter.
   ``For one thing, I only put an 18-pence stamp on the letter and
I think a letter to Russia costs 31 pence,'' said Hewson.

   Town residents will soon be carrying signs
saying ``Ban Burgers'' and ``Burgers Go Home,'' but they certainly
have nothing against fast food.
   The picketing is part of a commercial Arby's, the roast beef
sandwich chain, plans to film in this town of 2,100.
   ``The premise for the commercial is that a town bans burgers,''
said Mark Blair, a member of the town board.
   The switch from fast-food hamburgers to roast beef sandwiches
shouldn't be too difficult _ Hope has no fast-food restaurants.
   The producers wanted the town to ban burgers for real.
   ``That is the intention, that the town signs a proclamation,''
said director Marion Maus of Academy Film Productions Inc. of
Baltimore. ``They're not going to be policed, but it definitely is
a part of the strategy.''
   The town, which declined to ban the hamburger officially, will
receive $3,000 for its participation.

   More than 100 helmeted police wielding clubs
and tear gas rifles guarded the sacred Temple Mount today to
prevent possible violence as thousands of Moslems gathered to
worship on their holy day.
   Palestinian-Americans said they were being harassed by Israeli
authorities, and a top U.S. diplomat urged them to stand up for
their rights and file complaints with U.S. consular officials.
   Most of the 3,500 worshipers who gathered on the Temple Mount
filed peacefully out of mosques at the end of services. But about
50 youths held up a Palestinian flag and shouted: ``Jews, Jews, get
out of Palestine!''
   District police chief Rahamim Comfort said police arrested a
Palestinian woman and her husband after she tried to smuggle eight
firebombs past police guards and custodians into the mosque area.
   The Temple Mount, known in Arabic as the Haram al-Sharif, is the
third holiest site in Islam. It is believed to be the place from
which the prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven on horseback.
   It also is the location of the ancient Jewish Holy Temple
destroyed by the Romans 2,000 years ago and is regarded by Jews as
their holiest site.
   Police prepared for potential violence over the weekend when
Jews mark the Tisha B'Av fast day and Moslems begin celebrating the
four-day Id al Adha festival.
   Both holidays focus on the Temple Mount, with Jews marking the
destruction of the Temple and Moslems celebrating the story of
Abraham's aborted sacrifice of his son.
   In a meeting called by the Washington-based American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, about 200 Palestinian-Americans
claimed harassment by Israeli authorities.
   They said they were frequently singled out for demeaning
searches at Israel's borders and their money was sometimes
confiscated.
   ``Palestinians are treated like criminals,'' said Hammad Siyam,
49, of West New York, N.J., waving his American passport.
   Siyam, who was born in the West Bank village of Mukhmas, said
three months ago airport authorities confiscated $82,950 from a
village resident and the money had still not been returned.
   According to a senior U.S. official, Israeli authorities have
confiscated about $200,000 from Arab-Americans in the past three
months as part of an effort to stop the flow of funds intended to
support the 8-month-old uprising in Israeli-occupied territories.
   Since the violence began Dec. 8, 231 Palestinians and four
Israelis have died.
   Philip Wilcox, the U.S. consul general in Jerusalem, said
Israeli officials agreed to return the money, but he did not
discuss details of the agreement.
   Palestinian-Americans also complained that Israel only granted
them tourist visas, while U.S. Jews were given immediate residency.
   Israel grants automatic citizenship to all Jews desiring it
under the 40-year-old Law of Return.
   ``How come an American Jew from Brooklyn who has never been here
before has the right to stay in the West Bank forever, and I have
to go back after three months?'' said Ahmad Baker, a physician born
in the West Bank and living in Norfolk, Va.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Jews were a special case but ``as far as American tourists are
concerned, everybody gets the same treatment.''
   Palestinians said Israeli policy has divided many families
because Arab-Americans married to residents of the occupied lands
are not automatically granted residency.
   Wilcox said U.S. officials have discussed family reunification
with Israeli officials. He did not elaborate.
   On Thursday, Israeli troops fired on demonstrators protesting
the shutdown of Palestinian schools in the occupied lands and Arab
east Jerusalem. Hospital officials said three Palestinians were
killed and 16 wounded.
   Thursday's protests were among the most violent since the
uprising began.

   Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen chose a
gathering of Jesse Jackson's supporters today for their first
post-convention appearance, with Dukakis praising Jackson and
talking of his and Bentsen's own civil rights experiences.
   Dukakis told the group, including many Jackson delegates
disappointed that he is not on the Democratic ticket for the
election, ``We're going to need you. We want you. We can't win
without you.''
   The presidential nominee recalled the civil rights struggle and
spoke of his own experience traveling to Washington, D.C., in 1953
and seeing ``Jim Crow'' segregation.
   He pointed to his running mate and said that as a Texas
congressman Bentsen had voted in 1948 to kill the poll tax that was
used to deny voting rights to blacks.
   Jackson told the group that Dukakis ``deserves to become the
next president of the United States.''
   Dukakis, who was heading to Texas later today with Bentsen to
begin the fall campaign, told the Jackson supporters, ``We have 110
days, and I hope we can enlist every single one of you in this
cause.''
   Thursday night, in his speech accepting the nomination, Dukakis
urged voters ``to raise our sights'' beyond the Reagan years.
   ``The Reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin,''
Dukakis said in claiming the Democratic Party's nomination for the
presidency.
   ``We're going to forge a new era of greatness for America,'' he
said.
   The three-term Massachusetts governor was setting out on his
first campaign trip as the nominee after claiming the prize in a
forceful, 50-minute speech Thursday night to the Democratic
National Convention.
   The trip was both a symbolic homecoming for Bentsen and a strong
reminder that the Democratic ticket intends to battle for Texas,
the third largest state with 29 electoral votes and the adopted
home of Republican opponent George Bush.
   Getting a fast start on the general election campaign, Dukakis
and his vice presidential nominee then were flying on to Stockton,
Calif., and planned later appearances in Minot, N.D., St. Louis and
Erie, Pa., before Dukakis returns home Sunday night to Boston.
   The three-day cross-country swing was both a campaign kickoff
and a sign that the Democrats believe they can compete in regions
such as the West, Southwest and Midwest _ in farm areas and in
industrial regions _ that have gone Republican in recent elections.
   ``We're making a nationwide swing,'' said Dukakis spokesman
Dayton Duncan. ``He intends to run an aggressive national campaign
that concedes no state, no region, to George Bush and the
Republicans.''
   They were visiting three of the four largest states, each of
which loom as crucial showdown states: California, the largest with
41 electoral votes; Texas; and Pennsylvania, the fourth largest
with 25 states.
   ``They're all important states that we intend to contend for,''
Duncan said.
   The concluded four-day convention had a heavy focus on the South
and Texas, with Texans wielding the gavel and delivering the
keynote speech _ and with Bentsen joining the ticket for a
``Boston-Austin'' axis that had Democrats reminiscing about John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960.
   ``This is a truly national ticket, with a national message that
can win in November and will not allow the Republicans, as they
have in the past, to take any state for granted,'' Duncan said.
   After his speech and a display of unity with former rival
Jackson and other Democrats, Dukakis made the rounds of parties
celebrating both his triumph and the euphoria Democrats felt over
the party unity they managed to achieve.
   In his acceptance speech, Dukakis declared the Democrats the
party of the American dream and himself a product of that dream,
and said his candidacy represents the hope of extending opportunity
beyond ``the privileged few.''
   ``Because it's time to raise our sights, to look beyond the
cramped ideals and limited ambitions of the past eight years, to
recapture the spirit of energy and of confidence and of idealism
that John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson inspired a generation ago,''
he said.
   Dukakis touched the broad themes of his campaign, declaring
``this election isn't about ideology _ it's about competence.''
   He paid tribute to Jackson, whose conciliatory actions permitted
the Democrats to present a united front entering the general
election race.
   Dukakis called Jackson ``a man who has lifted so many hearts''
with his campaign, ``a man whose very candidacy says to every
child, aim high; to every citizen, you count; to every voter, you
can make a difference.''
   Dukakis also offered a reminder of Bush's criticism of President
Reagan's economic program, before Bush became Reagan's vice
president.
   ``It's time to rekindle the American spirit of invention and
daring, to exchange voodoo economics for can-do economics,'' he
said.

   A prison superintendent whose shotgun and
car were stolen by an escapee violated rules regulating storage of
a weapon, according to state officials who said they are unsure
whether he will be disciplined.
   Arthur Tate Jr. of the Chillicote Correctional Institute
violated state policy requiring personal weapons be stored in a
locked cabinet, Robert Prosser, spokesman for the Department of
Rehabilitation and Correction, said Thursday.
   The superintendent's 12-gauge shotgun and his car apparently
were taken by murderer Earl Jacobs, who escaped Wednesday. Jacobs,
51, was held in a minimum-security area of the prison that was not
fenced in or guarded.
   Prison officials believe Jacobs took the gun and Tate's car keys
after entering the rear door of Tate's unlocked home on the prison
grounds.
   Prosser said Tate had not been questioned about the gun, nor had
any thought been given to disciplinary action.
   Jacobs had served 26 years of a life sentence for murdering a
village marshal in 1962. Jacobs had never before attempted to
escape from the prison, said prison spokeswoman Lynn Goff.
   Jacobs had been on honor status at the prison since 1980 and was
assigned to tend Tate's yard at the time of his escape.

   Kennedy family matriarch Rose Kennedy turns 98
today, an event her family plans to celebrate this weekend at their
cluster of houses at Hyannis Port.
   Her only living son, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., is to fly to
Cape Cod from the just-concluded Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta for a small family dinner tonight.
   Also at the dinner will be Mrs. Kennedy's daughter, Eunice, and
son-in-law Sargent Shriver; daughters Patricia Lawford and Jean
Smith; daughter-in-law Ethel Kennedy, and an assortment of
grandchildren.
   Before dinner, Mass will be celebrated at home.
   Barring rain, the family might take Mrs. Kennedy out in her
wheelchair for some fresh air, Mrs. Smith said.
   Since a stroke in 1984, Mrs. Kennedy has been bedridden and
reportedly has been in poor health.
   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg last month named her newborn
daughter Rose Kennedy Schlossberg for the child's
great-grandmother, but mother, child and father, Edwin, are not
expected to go to Cape Cod this weekend, Mrs. Smith said.

   A launch pad test-firing of space
shuttle Discovery's main engines next week will be delayed at least
two days, NASA officials said today.
   The decision to delay until at least July 30 was made after
shuttle managers reviewed documents that showed not all elements
were ready, including a hazardous gas detection system that is not
thoroughly checked out.
   The 20-second firing of the three engines is considered critical
to certify Discovery for the first shuttle launch since the
Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986.
   It will test modifications made in the engine and provide
valuable countdown experience for the launch team.
   Officials said a delay in the test-firing would have only
minimal impact on the planned early September launch.
   However, the status of the launch is in doubt while engineers
puzzle over how to fix a small leak in a steering engine system
that is separate from the main engines. They hope to make the
repair on the pad and avoid rolling the shuttle back to a hangar, a
move that could delay the flight by as much as two months.
   Experts have several innovative suggestions for fixing the leak
of nitrogen tetroxide gas, which normally combines with fuel to
power the steering engines.
   The leak is six feet from the nearest entry panel and is blocked
from normal access by a maze of tubes, wiring and tanks.
   Taking a cue from heart doctors, engineers are considering
running a thin tube with an expandable balloon on the end through a
20-foot line with six sharp bends in it. It would be something like
a medical procedure known as an angioplasty, but instead of opening
a clogged artery, it would close off the leaking line.
   The materials and processing lab at the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., is devising a mockup of the 20-foot
line to test this approach.
   Another idea being explored is to enter Discovery's cargo bay
and cut holes through both the rear of the bay and the engine
compartment to reach the leak, then plug it by some method,
including encapsulating it with a clamshell-like device filled with
a sealant.
   Engineers hope to begin testing all suggested approaches by this
weekend.

  Jesse Jackson issued an emotional appeal today for
supporters to back the Democratic ticket and told Michael Dukakis
and Lloyd Bentsen that he will be keeping up the ``street heat'' to
make sure they don't forget his constituents.
   ``It is in order and it is right to support this ticket because
of our access to it and our relaionship with it,'' Jackson told
several hundred delegates as Dukakis and Bentsen looked on.
   ``We have every reason to be hopeful, to be excited, to know
that we are close to where we are going, a long way from where we
started,'' Jackson said. ``And in our lifetime you and I will be in
the White House.''
   He introduced Dukakis as ``a man I've come to know, to respect
... a man I've come to ... love because of his own sensitivity to
family,'' Jackson added: ``I bring to you a man I plan to watch up
close ... when he becomes ... the next president of the United
States _ Michael Dukakis.''
   The group erupted in applause and shouts of ``Duke, Duke.''
   ``We're going to need you, we want you, we can't win without
you,'' Dukakis responded.
   Jackson issued a blistering attack on the Reagan record and
called for Democratic unity. A progressive agenda will be won with
``a combination of street heat and leadership,'' he said.
   He promised Dukakis, ``There will be enough heat to cook our
meat and enough heat for George Bush to get out of the kitchen.''
   Jackson recalled that when Lyndon B. Johnson was added to the
ticket in 1960, some civil rights activists were concered. But
Johnson rose to the occasion, Jackson said.
   Turning to Bentsen, he said, ``In a real sense, your occasion is
now... You ask us to trust you. All we can ask of anyone is that
they not betray that trust.''
   Jackson repeated that he wants neither a job nor a title with
the Dukakis operation. ``I want to serve, free to serve at my own
pace, free to serve, free to challenge,'' he said.
   He said he expects his own relationship with the ticket will
influence some policies. ``What does it mean to me in practical
terms?'' Jackson asked. ``The contras have lost a vote.''
   Bentsen _ who has voted for aid to the Nicaraguan rebels _ and
Dukakis politely joined the applause as delegates chanted, ``No
contra aid.''
   Jackson, who had been the last survivor in the Democratic field
against Dukakis, had endorsed the ticket at Thursday night's
closing session of the party's convention. At the end of the long
road, Jackson said, ``I feel fantastic.''
   But it was clear he would have to do some selling to whip up
enthusiasn for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   Jesse Jackson embraced the Democratic ticket he had wanted to
head and gave the Democrats the unity send-off they sought for
victory in the November election.
   As he strode from the podium where he joined Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis on Thursday night, Jackson said, ``We have a good
ticket and a good team. And if the unity that is expressed here
tonight is sustained and expands, we will win and we will deserve
to win.''
   Asked his own feeling at the close of the convention, he said,
``I feel fantastic.''
   With the dust hardly settled from his own presidential campaign,
Jackson today was looking ahead to new political ventures. He
called a meeting today of his 1,200 delegates to include them in
his plans to campaign for the Dukakis ticket, raise money for his
own political action committee and register voters.
   It appeared Thursday night that he would have to do some selling
to whip up enthusiasm among some delegates for the team of Dukakis
and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Signs reading ``No Contra aid'' printed up by members of the
Vermont delegation were held up by several Jackson delegates around
the hall. Dukakis opposes aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
while Bentsen has voted for it in the past.
   ``He's against peace,'' said Vermont delegate Cindy Milstein who
mentioned several pro-military stands by Bentsen.
   But Jackson officials circulated a statement from him to his
delegates before the vice presidential vote, urging support of
Bentsen. The brief statement said that while he disagrees with
Dukakis and Bentsen on some issues, ``our interest converges in
building a coalition to beat the Republicans this fall.''
   Jackson's appearance in the hall later was clearly appreciated.
At the mention of his name by Dukakis, a deafening cheer went up
from both Jackson and Dukakis delegates. At first Jackson sat
unnoticed in a VIP box with former President Jimmy Carter, an
uncustomary role for Jackson, until Dukakis waved to him. Jackson
stood, gave a thumbs up and the delegates erupted in emotion.

   Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis, plunging
into his campaign to deny George Bush the White House, told
followers of Jesse Jackson today ``the stakes are very high'' and
``we can't win without you.''
   Underscoring the harmony of the just-concluded Democratic
National Convention, Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen joined
Jackson this morning before departing on a cross-country campaign
trek intended to show that no region of the country will be
surrendered to Bush.
   ``We have 110 days,'' said Dukakis, making his first appearance
since accepting his party's presidential nomination in a
tumultuous, confetti-strewn convention windup session. ``I hope we
can enlist every single one of you in this cause. We're going to
need you. We want you. We can't win without you.''
   ``The stakes are very high,'' Dukakis added. ``We can't take
another four years of what we've been going through for the past
eight.''
   Jackson said Dukakis ``deserves to be the next president of the
United States,'' sending the audience of several hundred people
into cheers of ``Duke, Duke.''
   Jackson told his supporters they had won a victory even though
they came in second. ``In our lifetime,'' Jackson said, ``you and I
will be in the White House.''
   At the same time, Jackson warned Dukakis and Bentsen he would be
keeping up the ``street heat'' to make sure they serve his
constituents' concerns.
   ``It is in order and it is right to support this ticket because
of our access to it and our relationship with it,'' Jackson said.
   In accepting the nomination Thursday night, Dukakis promised a
presidency that would make America ``greater, better, stronger,
prouder.''
   ``The Reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin,''
Dukakis declared. ``We're gonna win, we're gonna win,'' jubilant
delegates shouted back.
   By early today, the floor of the convention hall _ described by
some as a an elaborate set for a national television show _ had
been reduced to piles of debris by a cleanup crew. A few torn
placards remained, left behind by the sleepy-eyed delegates now
boarding airport buses at their hotels.
   Taking their newly forged partnership on the road, Dukakis and
Bentsen set out today for Bentsen's home state of Texas, a key
battleground in the fall struggle with Bush.
   Over the next three days, stops also are planned in California,
where many experts think the election will be settled; North
Dakota, in the traditionally Republican Farm Belt where the
Democrats hope to make inroads, and in the showdown states of
Missouri and Pennsylvania.
   ``It's time to raise our sights _ to look beyond the cramped
ideals and limited ambitions of the past eight years,'' Dukakis
told a jubilant convention crowd.
   Beyond the rhetoric, there were other reasons for the Democrats
to cheer. One was an ABC poll taken Wednesday that gave Dukakis a
53 to 41 percent lead over Bush, a sizable convention-week boost
from a 46-45 Republican lead in a poll taken Sunday.
   The jammed Omni coliseum _ forced to close the gates for a third
night because of overcrowding _ never seemed smaller as
flag-waving, hand-clapping delegates stood shoulder-to-shoulder to
cheer Dukakis and Bentsen, clasping their hands high in triumph.
   Accepting the vice presidential nomination, Bentsen made no
bones about his differences with Dukakis on Contra aid, school
prayer, a balanced budget amendment, the MX and B-1 and other
policies.
   ``Of course we have differences of opinion,'' said the
silver-haired Texan, who was put on the ticket to help crack the
Republican grip on the South. ``But on the basic issues of justice
and opportunity, we stand united. Democrats agree that a good job
at a fair wage is the passport to opportunity in America.''
   It was a night for old rivalries to be set aside.
   Amid an explosion of cheers, Jackson strode on stage to shake
hands with Dukakis, the man he failed to defeat, and with Bentsen,
whose job he wanted as a consolation prize.
   Dukakis, the cool technocrat who rarely shows emotion, was
stirred by the electricity of the evening and the shower of
adulation. ``I've never had a night quite like this one before,''
he said.
   Delegates gave him rave reviews. ``You got the idea he is real,
he can feel,'' said Darrell Ringer, a Kansas farmer who had been
pledged to Jackson. ``He spoke our language,'' said Hartford,
Conn., Mayor Carrie S. Perry, another Jackson delegate.
   Betty Van Uum of St. Louis said that if Bush were watching the
speech, ``he was probably quaking in his little Gucci shoes.''
   ``We're going to win because we are the party that believes in
the American dream,'' declared Dukakis, the 54-year-old son of
Greek immigrants. ``I know because I am a product of that dream,
and I'm proud of it.''
   His eyes glistened with tears and his voice caught in his throat
as he spoke of his late father, Panos. ``How I wish he were here
tonight. He'd be very proud of his son and his adopted country.''
   He said the Nov. 8 election ``isn't about ideology. It's about
competence.''
   He said a Dukakis administration would have a Justice Department
``that isn't the laughingstock of the nation.''
   Dukakis promised to do better than the incumbents in protecting
the environment and fighting illegal drugs. What's more, he said,
in a Dukakis White House, ``if you accept the privilege of public
service, you had better understand the responsibilities of public
service.
   ``If you violate that trust, you'll be fired; if you violate the
law, you'll be prosecuted; and if you sell arms to the Ayatollah,
don't expect a pardon from the president of the United States.''
   Echoing a 2,000-year-old pledge of his ancient Greek
forefathers, Dukakis vowed to ``never bring disgrace to this, our
country, by any act of dishonesty or cowardice. ... In all ways, we
will transmit this country greater, better, stronger, prouder and
more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.''
   Plotting strategy for the fall campaign, Dukakis' aides said he
will contest every state with Bush, who will get the Republican
presidential nomination at the GOP convention in New Orleans Aug.
15-18.
   ``He intends to run an aggressive national campaign that
concedes no state, no region, to George Bush and the Republicans,''
said Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan.
   To succeed, the ticket will have to win back the disenchanted
Democrats who switched to Reagan in 1980 and 1984. Nearly 40
percent of the members of the AFL-CIO voted to re-elect Reagan.
   ``The Democratic Party is the party of your parents; come on
home where you belong,'' appealed Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois
in a nominating speech for Bentsen that was aimed at the television
audience across America.

   Vice President George Bush today praised the
acceptance speech of rival Michael Dukakis but said he intends to
highlight the differences between the Democratic nominee and
Dukakis' own running-mate, Lloyd Bentsen.
   Bush told reporters that ``an effective use for Lloyd Bentsen''
would be for him to persuade Dukakis to change his positions on gun
control, prison furlough programs and a host of other issues.
   ``The differences are enormous'' between the Democratic
presidential and vice-presidential candidates, said Bush, who has
gone out of his way in recent days to praise the Texas Democrat as
a conservative.
   Speaking with reporters at an Italian festival here, the vice
president refused to be critical of Dukakis on anything other than
issues. The vice president said he watched Dukakis' speech to the
Democratic convention. ``I thought he gave a very good speech,''
Bush said. ``He did a very good job.''
   Bush was asked about Dukakis' statement that he wanted a vice
president who would come to him immediately if he found out about
something like the U.S. arms sale to Iran.
   Bush said he didn't know what the Massachusetts governor was
talking about. ``Ronald Reagan and I have worked as a team. I can
go in there and talk to him any time I want,'' he said.
   ``I don't know what that was all about, but I don't think it was
complimentary,'' Bush said, referring to Dukakis' comments.
   Bush said he was not troubled by his apparent dip in public
opinion polls following the Democratic convention, claiming as he
has before that he prefers fighting back as an underdog.
   ``I never thought it would be a cakewalk,'' the vice president
said.
   Bush on Thursday said he ``can't wait for the debates'' in this
presidential year, referring to what he said would be debates
between Dukakis and Bentsen.
   Bush hurled the barbs at the Democrats even as he claimed to be
trying to keep ``a relatively low profile'' as the rival party
commanded the spotlight in Atlanta.
   ``I wouldn't call this real campaigning. I don't want to overdo
it,'' Bush, who is certain to face Dukakis in November, told an
airport news conference in Greenville, S.C.
   Bush, who sandwiched two news conferences between private
fund-raising events in Greenville and in Charlotte, N.C., on
Thursday, was appearing today at an Italian festival in Milwaukee
and then flying to Bayhead, N.J., for a fund-raising event for the
Republican National Committee.
   Bush has all but spent the $27 million allowed to him under
pre-convention federal campaign spending law, and is using a host
of fund-raising events for the national party to help finance much
of his travel between now and the Republican convention next month
in New Orleans.
   He returned to Washington on Thursday night from the Carolinas
and said he planned to watch Dukakis' acceptance speech on
television at his residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory.
   Bush said Dukakis struck him as ``a very good man'' but he
suggested the Massachusetts governor seemed ``more positive than
the rest of the proceedings'' in Atlanta.
   He said the Democratic convention had produced its share of
``the ploy, the old rhetorical shout'' and that he did not intend
to respond directly to criticism of him from a succession of
Democratic speakers.
   ``I can't wait for the debates _ Dukakis vs. Bentsen. It's going
to be great,'' he quipped at an airport news conference in
Charlotte.
   Later, in Greenville, Bush said he didn't mind running against
what he said amounted to three Democratic candidates: Dukakis,
Bentsen and Jesse Jackson.
   ``I think there's two different stripes and three different
people. There's `very liberal,' and then there's Lloyd Bentsen.''
   ``My goal is to focus on the top of the ticket,'' Bush said.
   The vice president conceded that Democrats have seized national
attention with their convention. But, he added, the memory of
Democratic unity would soon be ``gone with the wind.''
   Bush allowed that Democrats staged an impressive show of unity
at their convention. But, he added, ``I don't know what's bubbling
under the surface of unity. There's a lot of bubbling discontent on
their side.''
   ``But that's got nothing to do with me,'' he added. ``My
business is to take on Michael Dukakis.''
   Meanwhile, administration and Bush campaign sources said James
A. Baker III will resign as treasury secretary to become Bush's
campaign chairman no later than Aug. 5.
   Bush said he would have something publicly to say on Baker's
role ``several Thursdays from now,'' reinforcing that timetable.
   Sources said New York investment banker Nicholas Brady, a former
Republican senator from New Jersey and chairman of the president's
task force studying last October's stock market crash, is the
leading contender to replace Baker as treasury secretary. The
sources spoke only on condition they not be identified.
   Bush spent last Saturday through Wednesday on a fishing trip
with Baker, a longtime friend and political adviser, in a remote
area near Cody, Wyo.
   ``I was in the wilderness _ no newspapers, no television, no
radio,'' Bush said. ``It was heaven.''
   Baker flew to California after the fishing trip so he could
discuss his decision to leave the administration and to head Bush's
campaign with President Reagan, administration sources said.
   Baker will become campaign chairman, a job that has been left
open for him. Baker ran Bush's 1980 presidential effort and was
senior counsel to Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater told reporters that he expects
to retain his current job title if Baker comes on as the No. 1
campaign official.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS graf 2 to CORRECT that McGeachy is spokeswoman for
Business Week, not McGraw-Hill</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A series of suspicious stock trades just before
Business Week's widely-read Wall Street column hit the streets has
prompted an investigation by the magazine's publisher that ``covers
the entire operation.''
   Business Week spokeswoman Mary McGeachy said Thursday that
McGraw-Hill Inc. was investigating the magazine's editorial staff
as well as employees in its four printing plants to determine
whether market-sensitive information was being leaked in advance of
publication.
   McGeachy said that ``some time back'' the company's legal
counsel began tracking stocks mentioned in the ``Inside Wall
Street'' column after noticing unusual rises and heavy trading
volume in those stocks on the day Business Week was printed but
before it reached newsstands.
   She said no employees had been suspended or fired.
   Although the cause of the movements has not been determined, the
probe is reminiscent of a case involving a Wall Street Journal
reporter who gave a stockbroker advance information on columns
expected to move stock prices.
   All Business Week employees are informed as part of their
orientation that they are obligated to disclose their stock
holdings to the editor in chief and will not report on those
companies, McGeachy said.
   Mary McCue, a spokeswoman for the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington, declined to comment on whether the agency
is investigating the matter. Spokespeople for the New York Stock
Exchange had left their offices for the day when called for comment.
   The presses begin rolling out Business Week in the early morning
each Thursday at plants in Connecticut, Wisconsin and California,
which produce the U.S. edition, and in Pennsylvania, which produces
the international edition.
   The magazine, which has circulation of 962,000, is shipped to
distributors on Thursday and is released to the news media after
the stock market closes that day.
   McGeachy said the suspicious stock movements occurred on several
Thursdays. According to a story from Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report on Thursday, of the 20 stocks mentioned in the last
seven ``Inside Wall Street'' columns, eight rose sharply on heavy
volume for no apparent reason the day the issue was printed.
   For example, a week ago Gradco Systems Inc. jumped $1 a share to
$9.75 on more than five times its average daily volume. The stock
was mentioned favorably in the column of the Business Week issue
available to the public the following day.
   Gene G. Marcial, author of the column, told Dow Jones, ``We've
been very much aware of when it happens.''
   McGeachy said McGraw-Hill checks the magazine's security
measures each week and monitors stock movements following
publication.
   ``Volumes and stock prices typically move on Fridays and
Mondays,'' she noted, but that is after the magazine is
disseminated to the public. ``We're very aware of the impact
Business Week has on the markets.''
   McGeachy said it was not unheard of for printing plant employees
and drivers to be offered cash for advance copies of some
magazines, but she did not include Business Week in that category.
   McGraw-Hill's investigation was not limited to Business Week's
editorial staff, she said. ``It covers the entire operation,''
including the company's printing plants, she said.
   In 1985, reporter R. Foster Winans of the Wall Street Journal
was convicted of wire fraud by passing tips to a stockbroker about
items scheduled to appear in the financial newspaper's influential
``Heard on the Street'' column.
   Winans' conviction was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in
1987. The decision, however, failed to clarify whether such cases
constitute insider trading.
   Winans was sentenced to 18 months in prison for leaking
information to former Kidder Peabody & Co. broker Peter Brant, who
was sentenced to 120 weekends in jail and fined $10,000 after
pleading guilty in 1984 to conspiracy and securities fraud.

   The number of juveniles arrested for selling
drugs in the District of Columbia increased by 456 percent in 1987
compared to a year earlier, according to a city study.
   The report, released Thursday by the district's office of
criminal justice and analysis, indicates that 35 percent of those
under the age of 18 who were arrested tested positive for drugs.
The hallucinogen PCP was the drug most commonly used, the report
stated.
   The report attributes the rise in youth drug arrests to the
increased use of juveniles by drug dealers.
   In a repeat of a surprise finding from 1986, the city's
fashionable Georgetown section remains among the areas where
violent crimes are most likely to occur.
   Arrests of adults for drug possession decreased 18 percent in
1987, but arrests of adults for drug dealing incerased by 5 percent.

   An Angolan cargo plane crashed in bad
weather as it prepared to land in the Nigerian capital of Lagos,
and all six crew members aboard were killed, the official Angolan
news agency said today.
   The ANGOP report said the Boeing 707 was about 12 miles from
Murtala Mohamed Airport in Lagos when it crashed Thursday.
   The report said the plane from the state-owned TAAG company's
fleet was en route from Ostend, Belgium, to the Angolan capital,
Luanda, and was to land in Lagos to refuel. The report was
monitored in Lisbon.
   The statement said fog and low clouds were believed to have
caused the crash, ANGOP reported. It added that communications with
the pilot showed the flight was proceeding normally without
technical problems.
   ANGOP said a team of TAAG technicians left for Lagos to
investigate. The agency said the bodies of the six crew members
were recovered.

   A jury today convicted a sheriff of
offering his opponent in the Republican primary race a job to drop
out.
   A jury deliberated 2\ hours over two days before finding
suspended Denton County Sheriff Randy Kaisner, 33, guilty of
bribery. The first-term sheriff faced up to 20 years in prison and
a $10,000 fine at sentencing later today.
   Kaisner was accused of offering Kirby Robinson the job of chief
deputy if he would drop out of the runoff made necessary after
neither candidate received a majority in the primary March 8.
Kaisner was seeking a second four-year term.
   Jack Ehrhart, the sheriff's former political adviser, said
Kaisner directed him to meet with Robinson the day after the Super
Tuesday primaries to persuade Robinson to withdraw.
   Kaisner testified that he and Ehrhart talked about Robinson's
qualifications as a chief deputy, but he denied sending Ehrhart to
meet with Robinson.
   The sheriff said it was not until two days later that he learned
that Ehrhart had made a job offer contingent on Robinson's dropping
out.

   The move makes some farmers eligible for Farmers Home
Administration loans to help offset losses.
   The announcement by Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., came a day
after U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng visited a
drought-stricken dairy farm.
   While rain has fallen in Wisconsin the past week, it has come
too late to help many farmers salvage their crops. Corn and hay
have been hard hit by the drought. Both are used as money crops and
as feed for cows.

   Iran said Iraq dropped chemical bombs on
two villages and occupied three towns in western Iran today. Iraq
claimed it recaptured the last land seized by Iran in the
8-year-old war.
   U.N. officials prepared to mediate a cease-fire following Iran's
acceptance of a U.N. cease-fire resolution passed one year ago.
   But Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
urged Iranian Revolutionary Guards to continue fighting, Tehran
radio reported.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi forces
occupied the Iranian border towns of Khosrawi, Qasr-e Shirin and
Sar-e Pol Zahab in the central sector of the 730-mile front. ``The
battle is still raging in the area,'' IRNA said in a report
monitored in Nicosia.
   The towns are about 110 miles northeast of the Iraqi capital of
Baghdad, and Sar-e Pol Zahab is 12 miles from the border.
   A military communique read over Iraqi television said Iraq
``retook whatever was left of our land from the Iranians.''
   Iraq identified the area as the Saif Saad region, a disputed
territory that Iraq claims under the terms of a 1975 agreement
between the two countries.
   The Iraqi report made no mention of chemical weapons, and it
denied the Iranian report that 5,000 Iraqi soldiers died in the
border fighting.
   Iraq has vowed not to occupy Iranian territory, which it
abandoned in the first years of the war after its drive into Iran
was blunted by Iranian forces.
   The communique said the elite residential guards, along with the
Second Army Corps, smashed the Iranian defenders and took thousands
of Iranians ``into Iraqi hospitality.''
   It said the Iraqis took a large number of prisoners to equalize
the number of prisoners held by both sides prior to possible peace
talks. After Iran on Monday accepted the cease-fire resolution,
Iraq proposed direct peace talks. Iran has refused to meet
face-to-face.
   The war broke out in September 1980 when Iraqi troops went
through the border crossing at Qasr-e Shirin.
   Both sides frequently accuse the other of resorting to chemical
weapons, banned internationally by the 1925 Geneva Conventions.
Iraq has admitted using them, citing U.N. reports with evidence of
use by both sides, while Iran denies their use.
   ``Iran's Moslem combatants are reportedly engaged in ongoing
fighting with the enemy troops and have inflicted heavy losses and
casualties on the aggressor Iraqis,'' said IRNA.
   IRNA also said Iraqi jet fighters flew over the city of Ahwaz in
Khuzestan province in southwest Iran at 6:40 and 8:20 a.m. but were
chased off by heavy anti-aircraft fire.
   On Thursday, the official Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi troops
were ``purging Iraqi border peaks of the filth of enemies.''
   IRNA said one civilian was killed and two injured Thursday by
Iraqi shells falling on the village of Sardasht in northwestern
Iran.
   ``By accepting the cease-fire, we wanted to prove that (Iraqi
President) Saddam (Hussein) does not believe in peace and we will
respond to him on the war fronts,'' Khomeini said, according to the
report today.
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei said the Iranian armed forces
were supporting Khomeini's acceptance of the cease-fire despite
their eagerness to ``rub the enemy's nose in the dirt,'' the
Islamic Republic News Agency said. Khamenei spoke at Friday prayer
services in Tehran.
   He said Iraq had yet to respond ``honestly'' to the resolution.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said an eight-member team of
military observers assembled in Jerusalem and Vienna will try to
arrange a cease-fire and a second group being assembled in Geneva
will look into prisoners of war.
   Both teams were expected to begin their trip to the Persian Gulf
during the weekend.
   Iran on Monday said it would accept a year-old U.N. resolution
for a cease-fire in the war, which has killed or wounded an
estimated 1 million people.
   The U.N. resolution calls for an immediate truce and troop
withdrawal and sets out a peace plan to end the war, including the
return of captured soldiers.

   A jury has awarded $70,000 to a man who
had part of his nose bitten off by a Christmas Eve reveler.
   Michael Nardella, a furnace repairman from Branford, lost a
portion of his nose in 1982 in an attack by Vern Tolman of New
Haven during a party at another person's home.
   A Superior Court jury this week ordered Tolman to pay Nardella
$70,000 but rejected an additional claim that the homeowner had a
legal duty to prevent the attack.
   The jury apparently decided the attack was so bizarre the
homeowner could not have foreseen it, said Nardella's attorney,
Steven Jacobs.
   However, Tolman is unemployed and owns no property. ``We have a
$70,000 judgment that isn't worth a penny, for all intents and
purposes,'' Jacobs said.
   Tolman pleaded guilty to assault and was placed on five years'
probation, Nardella's lawyer said.
   Nardella has spent $11,500 on surgery and requires $8,000 more
in medical care, Jacobs said. As partial compensation, he said, the
state Criminal Injuries Compensation Board paid Nardella $8,500.

<HEAD>Letter to Iowa Pen Pal to be Auctioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month before the Nazis invaded Holland, Anne
Frank and her sister wrote pen-pal letters to two girls in Iowa,
only hinting at the danger to come.
   The correspondence _ two letters, a postcard, two passport-size
photographs of the Jewish sisters and an envelope _ has been
verified by the director of the Anne Frank Center in Amsterdam and
is to be auctioned in October.
   ``Dear Juanita,'' Anne wrote in her letter, part of which was
reprinted in Friday's New York Times, ``I did receive your letter
and want to answer you as quick as possible. Margot and myself are
the only children in our house. Our grandma is living with us. My
father has an office and mother is busy at home.''
   She signed the letter Annelies Marie Frank.
   Margot wrote, ``We often listen to the radio as times are very
exciting, having a frontier with Germany and being a small country
we never feel safe.''
   After the letters were written, Anne and her family, refugees
from Germany, hid in a Dutch house until they were found by the
Nazis. Her diary, published in 1952, is an account of their life
there.
   Anne Frank was 15 when she died in the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp in 1945.
   The letters, dated April 27 and 29, 1940, were sent to two farm
sisters in Danville, Iowa _ Juanita Wagner, 11, who was Anne's age,
and Betty Ann Wagner, 15, the age of Anne's sister, Margot.
   In a telephone interview with the Times, Betty Ann Wagner, of
Burbank, Calif., said she and her sister, now Juanita Wagner
Hiltgen, of Redlands, Calif., started the pen-pal mail at the
suggestion of a teacher.
   ``We never received a reply from our second letters in answer to
theirs, but we thought that had to do with the war and
censorship,'' said Miss Wagner.
   ``After the war, in 1946, we wrote to the Amsterdam address that
the letters had come from and we received a sad letter from their
father, who told us how the family had died during the war,'' she
said. ``I just sat and cried.''
   The sisters kept the letters and told their friends about them.
Only recently did they decide to make them public and auction them.
   The letters are to be auctioned by Swann Galleries in New York
on Oct. 25.
   George Lowry, president of the galleries, said he thought at
first the letters, to be sold as one package, might bring $20,000
to $30,000. He now thinks they might go for more because of
possible interest by institutions.

   Investigators seized files about a Florida
condominium, a golf tournament and contributions from a New York
paper company that was searched as part of the Pentagon fraud and
bribery inquiry, court papers show.
   The same court documents, unsealed Thursday, say one focus of
the investigation is on the possible extortion of campaign
contributions from companies by private consultants and others.
   This information was contained in an attachment to a search
warrant executed last month at the Kane Paper Co. in Baldwin. James
Kane, the president of Kane Paper, is the founder of the Long
Island Aerospace Political Action Committee.
   Among the documents seized at Kane Paper, which included
searches of trash receptacles, were a ``Florida condo file,'' a
``contribution file,'' a ``political file box'' and a folder
labeled ``golf tournament 1984-87.''
   The document also indicated investigators were probing whether
an employee of the Unisys Corp., a private consultant and others
bribed federal officials involved in the authorization or
appropriation of defense contracts.
   The Unisys employee named was Dennis Mitchell, whose office also
has been searched, and the private consultant was Charles Gardner,
a former Unisys employee.
   Unisys, a military contractor that manufacturers the Aegis fire
control and radar systems, earlier this week announced that it had
suspended six employees from its surveillance and fire control
unit, which Gardner formally headed.
   The Mitchell search warrant said investigators were looking into
a possible plot by Mitchell, Gardner and others ``to defraud Unisys
by diverting monies to individuals and business entities to
illegally influence the defense contracting process, and for their
own personal use.''
   According to published reports, Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., toured
the Unisys plant in Great Neck and was handed several campaign
contribution checks by Mitchell. Those checks and several others
mailed later totaled $14,000 and were from businessmen and others
interested in seeing increased military spending on Long Island,
the news reports said.
   Dyson, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, was on a
trip to see Unisys this year when his top aide, Tom Pappas,
committed suicide by jumping from a Manhattan hotel the day after a
Washington Post story said he made unusual work demands on members
of Dyson's staff.
   Another person who has been searched in the case is Richard
Seelmeyer, a former aide to the late Rep. Joseph Addabbo of Queens.
   The mention of campaign contributions came in one line in the
attachment that said investigators were looking into a scheme to
``extort campaign contributions from companies doing business with
...'' The rest of the statement had been deleted.
   The document was among four search warrants and related papers
ordered unsealed by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman of Brooklyn
in response to an application by Newsday Inc., a New York and Long
Island newspaper.
   The other search warrants were executed at the Hazeltine Corp.
in Greenlawn, the office of Mitchell in Great Neck and the home of
Gardner.
   The newly disclosed documents detail the numerous financial
records, computer files, letters and other property seized by
federal investigators at the four locations.
   The papers were heavily edited to protect individuals and
companies not previously named in court papers. This was a
condition to the disclosure set by Korman.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said he had not
seen the court papers unsealed in New York and had ``no immediate
comment'' on them.
   Meanwhile, The Hartford (Conn.) Courant on Thursday asked U.S.
District Judge John H. Pratt in Washington to unseal affidavits
supporting a search of offices there of Pratt & Whitney, the jet
engine maker. Pratt already has denied a request by The Washington
Times for the same documents.
   In Minneapolis, U.S. Magistrate Earl Cudd today took under
advisement a request by Cowles Media Co., publisher of the Star
Tribune, for release of the affidavits supporting a June 13 search
of three offices at a Unisys plant in Eagan, Minn. Prosecutors on
Thursday opposing the release.
   Cudd said he would rule next week on whether the documents
should be released unedited or kept under seal.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Overturns Decision To Combine 35,000 Asbestos Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has overturned a judge's
ruling combining 35,000 asbestos-related lawsuits against a company.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said Wednesday that consolidating the suits would slow resolution
of the cases.
   U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining Jr. last month consolidated
the personal injury lawsuits against Raymark Industries Inc. at the
company's request, creating the biggest asbestos-related injury
case ever.
   More than 100 plaintiffs had objected to having their lawsuits
consolidated, saying none of them had been notified about the move,
according to court records. They also argued that the evidence did
not justify the action.
   In overturning the consolidation decision, the appeals court
said, ``The court's order, which essentially moves their cases back
to square one, could hardly place petitioners in a more drastic
predicament.''
   Raymark has been the target of 70,000 asbestos lawsuits
involving 82,000 people during the past 10 years. The suits claim
people developed asbestos-related diseases after exposure to
insulation and other Raymark products.
   Half the cases have been resolved by trial, settlement or
dismissal.
   Raymark, which expects 65,000 more cases to be filed during the
next decade, sought to have the suits combined in a class action
because the separate claims were depleting the company's insurance
coverage.

   National Transportation Safety Board
investigators searching for clues to the cause of a fiery crash of
a twin-engine charter plane combed through wreckage for the second
day today, said a NTSB spokesman.
   ``We don't know the flight history of the plane yet,'' said Ted
Lopatkiewicz. But he said the plane's owner, Fairways Corp., has
said it purchased the aircraft new in 1969.
   The 19-seat, propeller-driven commuter plane crashed Wednesday
during take-off at Dulles Interntional Airport west of Washington.
The only person on board was the pilot, Melvin Shockley of Fairfax,
Va., who was killed.
   Fairways has been identified by aviation officials as a charter
service based at National Airport, but The Washington Post has
reported that it is operated by the Central Intelligence Agency and
that information about the identity of the pilot was delayed at the
request of the CIA.
   CIA officials have said they would not confirm of deny any
contractural or proprietary relationship with Fairways.
   Fairways spokesman Joseph Hexter would not comment on reports
that his firm is connected to the CIA, saying only ``Fairways Corp.
is a charter airline which flies passengers for the United States
government and private companies.''
   Lopatkiewicz said Shockley, who was not identified until late
Thursday, had worked for Fairways for three years and was well
qualified to fly the plane.
   He said the pilot last week conducted a roundtrip flight to St.
Louis with a Lear jet, returning to National Airport with the jet
on Sunday.
   ``That was his last flight before the accident,'' said
Lopatkiewicz.
   The plane had been at Dulles for a routine maintenance check and
was headed back to National when it crashed.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Defense Department Starting Dangerous Germ Warfare
Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of scientists said today that the
Department of Defense is asking for $300 million to start
biological weapons research that could be dangerous to the military
and to civilians worldwide.
   The scientists, organized as a group called the Committee for
Responsible Genetics, announced that it is circulating a petition
to encourage all American biological scientists to not participate
in Pentagon research that could result in the development of
biological weapons.
   ``It is clear that the world has come to the point that the
production of biological weapons is relatively simple,'' said
Christian Anfinsen, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore. ``We could develop warheads to
spread anthrax (disease) within 6 months and so could the Soviets.''
   But, said Anfinsen, ``no war could be won this way'' because a
counterattack would be swift and deadly.
   The scientist said that with the advances in biology of recent
decades, scientists in many countries now could use genetic
techniques to develop viruses or bacteria against which there could
be no defense.
   Anfinsen and three other scientists said at a news conference
that the Department of Defense is asking for a $300 million
appropriation to accelerate its research into a defense against
biological weapons. They said the Pentagon plans to reopen the
Dugway Proving Ground in Utah as a biological weapons testilng
center.
   A Department of Defense spokesman, Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, said he
had no immediate comment on the statements.
   Jonathan King, a professor of biology at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said that the same techniques needed to
develop a defense against biological weapons can also be used to
develop the weapons themselves.
   ``In an offense biological warfare program, the first thing you
do is develop a vaccine,'' he said.
   King also said that the danger of biological weapons is that
they could lead to uncontrolled contamination of vast populations
if they are released.
   ``Biological weapons are not like gunpowder or nuclear bombs,''
he said. ``Biological weapons can spread and reproduce.''
   King and the other scientists said that Department of Defense
officials now are actively recruiting biologists to conduct germ
warfare research.
   ``I have been approached and most of us have,'' said King.
   The Committee for Responsible Genetics is circulating among
university biologists a petition that contains a pledge to not
engage knowingly in research that would further development of
biological warfare agents.

<TEXT>
   Inside the Omni hall late Thursday night, the
buttoned-down governor of Massachusetts strode into a spotlight,
walked confidently past the front row of delegates and climbed to a
height he had not reached before.
   When Michael Dukakis punched the air in the direction of the
Massachusetts delegation, his most fevered backers simply let go.
Standing, stomping and cheering, they fused into a screaming wave
of released energy.
   Before he finished the first line of his speech, they were again
on their feet. ``Let's go, Mike! Let's go, Mike!''
   ``... the race to the finish line begins. ...''
   Another wave of cheering. Seated side by side, Mary Anastopoulos
of Lowell, a daughter of Greek immigrants, and Amy Anthony, the
governor's tough-talking housing secretary, had to prop each other
up _ their shoulders shaking and their eyes red.
   ``... I accept. ...'''
   A roaring, pulsing outburst of flag-waving, sign-pumping energy,
reflected in Dukakis' own growing sureness and force.
   At the rim of The Omni, in a skybox above and just behind the
Massachusetts seats, campaign manager Susan Estrich stood front and
center, surrounded by her senior staff, surveying their handiwork.
   At her side was husband Marty Kaplan, an executive with the
Magic Kingdom of Disney. Sitting and standing together, they
personified the marriage of politics and show business unfolding
with stopwatch timing all around them.
   Far away, across the hall, a man they know as Michael and joke
about as a loner and pedant, was hitting his lines, opening his
self, and _ on the biggest night of his political life _ doing his
job.
   ``...time to exchange voodoo economics for can-do economics.
...''
   Amplified and fortified by all the wizardry of big-time
productions, Dukakis became the focus of the hunger in the hall for
belief, for challenge and above all for victory.
   ``... those handsome and proud and articulate Jackson children.
...''
   With his gestures and his language, Dukakis encompassed nearly
all of the doubters, leaving Bill Strickland of Amherst, Mass., a
down-the-line Jackson coordinator, to shrug and join in.
   As representatives of the governor's home state, the
Massachusetts delegation was jammed with delegates and staff,
filling every seat and jamming the aisles, standing anywhere they
could perch to shout, pump their signs up and down, and punch
little American flags in the air.
   Seasoned politicians, some of the state's highest elected
officials, men who usually sneer at cornball enthusiasm, were
clapping in unison, bouncing on their toes in time to march music,
and cheering for a man they thought they knew.
   ``... we will never bring disgrace to this, our country. ...''
   By mid-speech, the only peole moving besides TV correspondents
were the Dukakis whips, working the aisles as best they could,
making sure every delegate had a sign and a flag at the right
moment, leading the cheers, pushing and whipping the faithful along.
   For politically alert people from Massachusetts, there was
nothing new in the speech _ no stories or facts or attitudes they
had not heard before, in some cases many times.
   But by the end, the Massachusetts corner of the building and all
the gear and people in it were fused into a giant, pulsing,
stomping, cheering body.
   Dukakis worked all his levers and pushed all his themes _
family, success, seriousness, purpose, and, above all, a will to
win.
   On their way out, the hoarse and sweaty delegates paused to get
their bearings, surprised at themselves and at him.
   Some were openly fired up. Others had that quiet look often seen
in the eyes of the Dukakis team that says they would walk through
walls for the guy.

<TEXT>
   King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Friday
pardoned a former minister who was imprisoned for insulting the
monarchy when he said life in the royal palace was much easier than
peasant life.
   Veera Musikapong, a former deputy minister, began serving a
four-year sentence last month after the Supreme Court upheld a
lower court conviction on charges of ``lese majesty,'' an offense
against a ruler's dignity.
   Veera, 40, made the remarks in July 1986 while campaigning in
the northeastern Buriram province for a Parliament seat.
   He resigned in September 1986 when opposition parties seized on
the issue to attack the government of Prime Minister Prem
Tinsulanonda.
   In upholding Veera's conviction, the Supreme Court reduced his
sentence from six to four years.
   Interior Minister Prachuab Soontrangkul informed reporters
Friday of the king's decision to pardon Veera.

   South Korea's most prestigious

what would be another sign of thawed relations between the two
countries, officials said Friday.
   Prof. Lee Hyun-ku, head of academic affairs at the state-run
Seoul National University, told a National Assembly meeting that
discussions were under way on admitting Chinese students. He did
not give details.
   The university, the largest and most prestigious in South Korea,
has an enrollment of 20,000. About 100 foreign students are
currently enrolled but none are from communist nations, Lee said.
   South Korea and China do not maintain diplomatic ties, but trade
and other non-political contact between the two nations has been
expanding in recent years. Bilateral trade reached $2 billion last
year.

   A security guard hired to protect a

officials said Friday.
   Investigators said the guard waited for other guards to leave
the Quezon City branch of the Philippine Commercial and Industrial
Bank as it closed Thursday and made his move just before the
remaining tellers closed the vault.
   Armed with a 12-gauge shotgun, the guard ordered the tellers
into the vault and scooped up nearly $25,000, said a bank security
officer who asked not to be identified. The guard then fled.

<TEXT>
   Nico, a counter-culture figure in the 1960s who
sang with the Velvet Underground pop group and starred in Andy
Warhol movies, died at age 49, her manager said Friday.
   Her manager, Manchester-based Alan Wise, said she died in a
hospital on the Spanish island of Ibiza Monday night, a few hours
after falling off a bicycle. A coroners' report said she suffered a
cerebral hemorrhage, Wise said.
   She is to be cremated on Tuesday in Berlin, he said.
   She had been vacationing on Ibiza with Ari, her 25-year-old son
by French actor Alain Delon.
   Born Christa Paffgen in Germany, she grew up in Berlin and
worked as a model in Paris and Rome before getting a minor role in
1960 in Federico Fellini's movie La Dolce Vita.
   ``Her long blond hair, pronounced cheekbones, imposing height
and low, heavily accented voice quickly made her one of the new
decade's most striking figures,'' said The Times of London in an
obituary.
   In the 1960s she moved to New York, joining pop artist Andy
Warhol's coterie of what he called ``superstars.'' She appeared in
Warhol's film ``Chelsea Girls,'' and was featured with the Velvet
Underground, singing songs written by the group's leader, Lou Reed.
   Her solo album, ``Chelsea Girl,'' included songs written by Bob
Dylan and Jackson Browne, and was followed by three more albums.
   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s she lived a nomadic existence,
occasionally performing, and spending more and more time on Ibiza
in the Mediterranean, The Times said.

   Recipients of assistance from the international
relief agency CARE, many of them victims of drought in their
homelands, are being victimized a second time as the drought in
this country dries up the supply of basic food commodities, the
agency said.
   Prices for such foodstuffs as wheat, corn and cooking oil are
escalating, forcing CARE to reduce the amount available for
distribution to Africa, Asia and Latin America, said CARE spokesman
George Wirt.
   ``Already the kinds of foods and the amounts of foods that will
be available are being affected,'' said Rudy Von Bernuth, the
agency's director of programs. ``We have already lost powdered milk
for next year.''
   CARE's food programs are funded by government grants and private
contributions. While income remains constant ``the prices are going
up so fast that the tonnage level needed to support the programs
will not be met.''
   ``In literal terms it will mean less on their plates,'' Von
Bernuth said. ``Resources are going to be stretched very thin.''
   For example, Wirt said, the price of vegetable oil has gone from
$7.12 a gallon earlier this year to $8.55. It's expected that
bulgur wheat, which recently sold for $183 a ton, will top $200 a
ton, he said.

<HEAD>Andean Condors To Be Released As Forerunners To California Condors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four young Andean condors are going to be
introduced to the Los Padres National Forest in an experiment that
wildlife experts hope will lead the way to eventually returning
California condors to the wild.
   Scientists said Thursday they believe the information they get
from monitoring the Andean condors will help them avoid problems
when they begin releasing California condors in the early 1990s.
   There are only 28 known California condors, the largest flying
birds in North America, and all of them are at the Los Angeles Zoo
and the San Diego Wild Animal Park. Scientists hope to save the
species by breeding the birds in captivity to build up the
population and later releasing them.
   The last free California condor was captured in April 1987.
   Although the Andean condors, which are native to South America,
are considered endangered, there are thousands of them.
   Researchers in the two-year, $200,000 program will start with
newborn condors that haven't developed any domesticated habits.
   Nine zoos have sent eggs to the Los Angeles Zoo and the wild
animal park. After hatching, the chicks will be kept in captivity
for three months, using puppets that resemble adult condors to feed
them, said Michael Wallace, curator of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo
and the project's field coordinator.
   ``We have to make sure the birds have some fear of humans to
protect them,'' Wallace said. ``When they see a human on the
horizon, it may be a hunter.''
   At the age of three months the birds will be taken to a large
outdoor cage, and they will be released when they are about 7
months old, the age they would normally leave the nest, Wallace
said.
   The first chicks will be three months old next month and are
tentatively scheduled to be moved the weekend of Aug. 19 to a spot
near the Hopper Mountain Wildlife Refuge in northern Ventura
County, northwest of Los Angeles.
   A group of eight scientists and technicians and 200 volunteers
will monitor the birds' moves by radio transmitters to distinguish
eating patterns and other habits. Scientists said they will provide
food for the birds throughout the experiment.
   The observers will periodically recapture the birds to monitor
their health and check their transmitters, Wallace said.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the lead agency in the
program, will provide protection for the birds, wildlife inspector
Ron Drifka said.

   Palestinians are feeling a
financial pinch after more than seven months of self-imposed
commercial strikes and a boycott of jobs in Israel.
   But many say they are managing to make ends meet by cooperating
with each other, raising their own food and passing up large
purchases. Pro-Palestinian organizations abroad also have helped by
stepping up contributions to the occupied territories.
   Although some Palestinians participate in commercial strikes
under pressure and threats from local Arab leaders, others say the
sense of pride they gain from their rebellion makes the financial
difficulties manageable.
   Ever since Iyad Mughrabi, 30, quit his $600-a-month job at an
Israeli supermarket earlier this year, he and his children have
lived with his parents.
   ``I have gained respect, even if I lost money,'' said the father
of two. ``Before, when I went to a refugee camp and talked about
the intefadeh (Arabic for uprising), the young men would say, `Shut
up and first stop working for the Jews.' ''
   At a summit in Algiers in June, Arab leaders pledged $120
million in financial backing for the uprising for the last four
months of this year and $40 to 50 million after that.
   The funds are distributed by an elaborate underground network
that aids some of the needy and pressures wealthier Palestinians to
serve the national cause by forgoing profits and rent collection.
   Many contributions enter the territories clandestinely. Israel,
desperate to cut off the cash flow, passed new regulations recently
making it illegal for Arabs entering the country to bring in more
than $1,200 each.
   Despite the financial help, many Palestinians are still
suffering.
   Western economic observers say the uprising has cost
Palestinians $330 million, about 20 percent of the $1.65 billion
gross national product of the territories.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8, Palestinian stores have opened
only three hours a day and at least once a week the underground
leadership calls for a complete general strike.
   In addition, an estimated 20 to 25 percent of the 120,000
Palestinians who once had Israeli jobs have quit, according to
Israel's Labor Ministry. Half of all Gaza workers and one-third of
the West Bank's work force are employed in Israel.
   In Ramallah, a Palestinian town 15 miles north of Jerusalem,
most stores that sell electronic goods and furniture do not open at
all anymore and a drop in tourism has driven souvenir stores and
hotels into near bankruptcy.
   ``People want only the very essential stuff: sugar, rice, flour,
canned goods, dried yogurt,'' said Mustafa Abu Zahra, who said he
is selling about 60 percent less in his Jerusalem dried goods since
the uprising began. He refused to disclose his monthly income.
   Palestinian farmers, too, are hurting. Military restrictions
such as extensive curfews, which bar residents of an area from
leaving their homes, have prevented villagers from irrigating and
harvesting crops.
   In the West Bank village of Beit Ummar, the military government
blocked farmers from exporting grapes and plums to Jordan after an
attacker threw a firebomb, seriously burning a soldier, said
Olivier Rafowitz, a military government spokesman.
   The grassroots Palestinian self-help system, run by local
committees under the guidance of underground Arab leaders, has
provided some help.
   Local leaders have exerted pressure on Arab employers not to lay
off workers, and workers whose pay has not been affected by the
uprising are asked to make sacrifices, said an Arab labor organizer
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Local committees also provide some food and other basics to
those families whose breadwinners have been killed, injured or
imprisoned in the rioting, said a committee activist who also spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   More than 230 Palestinians have died in protests since the
uprising began. Four Israelis have been killed.
   Many Palestinians respond philosophically to questions about
their fiscal woes.
   ``There are people here who lost children in the intefadeh,''
Mughrabi said. ``I've just lost money.''

   A pair of peregrine falcons apparently still
consider the Union Bank building home despite a fire that burned
offices several floors below their roost.
   ``They're fine,'' said Union Chairman John Harrigan, who
monitors the nest on the 39th floor by a closed-circuit television
in his office a floor below.
   Offices on the 34th and 35th floors of the 39-story building
were scorched Monday night after a paint thinner-soaked cloth
touched an outlet and ignited a fire.
   The peregrines were brought to Union Bank six years ago by the
national Peregrine Fund and the Western Foundation of Vertebrate
Zoology in an effort to re-establish the endangered species
downtown.
   The falcons already have raised a male offspring.
   ``They identify very much with this building. It is the center
of their little universe,`` Harrigan said. ``They came by yesterday
(after the fire) and looked the place over. I don't know what they
thought. They might have thought it was a little smoky.''

<HEAD>Surgeon General Forsees Anti-AIDS `Retribution'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said today
that a wave of public ``retribution'' against groups whose problems
are seen as their own doing, including smokers and drunken
drinkers, could spread to AIDS victims by the next decade.
   ``Such a response would be tragic, but not unexpected to the
health profession,'' Koop said.
   He cited the recent passing of laws to segregate smokers and
public ``retribution against drunk drivers, teenagers who become
pregnant, drug addicts and wife beaters.''
   The anti-smoking attitude, he said, is being expressed in the
adoption of laws setting up no-smoking areas in restaurants and
banning smoking from entire office buildings and workplaces.
   ``These are examples of public retribution exercised against
smokers,'' he said, also telling his audience, ``Most Americans
would like to see all smokers stop.''
   And he said it is possible that the American people, ``already
traveling the road of retribution,'' will extend that retribution
against AID victims in the 1990s, ``when the annual health bill for
the disease reaches $5 billion.''
   He did not say what retribution might be taken against people
suffering from the fatal disease.
   The challenge to health professionals, he said, will be to move
reaction to more responsive, productive and tolerant attitudes
toward those with AIDS.
   The surgeon general commented in a speech after reeceiving an
honorary fellowship from the American College of Legal Medicine.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus,
now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, discovered in
France and the United States.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of July 4, AIDS had been diagnosed in 66,464 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 37,535 have died since June 1981, according
to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
   The drought in the United States
is turning into a multi-billion-dollar boon for farmers in
economically distressed Argentina and Brazil, agricultural experts
say.
   While U.S. crops wilt under the worst drought conditions since
the Dust Bowl, recently harvested crops of soybeans and winter
wheat in Argentina and Brazil are fetching the highest export
prices in years, the experts say.
   Many of Argentina's 450,000 farmers are planting as much as
possible to cash in on record prices for soybeans, which last year
replaced wheat as the country's No. 1 cash crop. Argentina is the
third-largest producer of soybeans after the United States and
Brazil.
   Soybean plantings increased 19 percent in Argentina and 15.6
percent in Brazil this year compared to 1987, the experts say.
   Olacyr de Moraes, Brazil's soybean king and one of the country's
richest men, just bought 74,100 acres in northern Maranhao state to
plant the crop.
   After suffering from years of low world grain prices, Argentine
farmers of wheat, corn, sorghum and soybeans see a bright
short-term future. They are buying land and ordering new tractors
and farm equipment.
   ``We're all conscious that our well-being is owed to the drought
in the United States,'' said Rogelio Luraschi, manager of the
Carlos Casado farm cooperative outside Rosario, 200 miles northwest
of the capital.
   Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras
estimated revenues this year from grain exports _ primarily
soybeans, wheat and corn _ at 3.8 billion dollars, up 2 billion
dollars from 1987.
   In Brazil, the government estimated revenues from soybean
exports, its top cash crop, at $3.5 billion this year, up $1.2
billion from 198. It expects a bumper soybean crop of 18.2 million
tons, up from 17 million tons in 1987.
   The multi-billion-dollar boost couldn't have come at a better
time.
   Argentina is plagued by an average annual inflation rate of 322
percent, unproductive state industries and worker unrest over wages
that fail to match the rising cost of living.
   Brazil too is suffering from an economic crisis. It is the
developing world's largest debtor, owing creditors $121 billion.
Mexico is second, followed by Argentina, which owes $55 billion.
   Although the Argentine and Brazilian soybean crops are close to
being fully harvested, farmers in both countries say they are
holding on to much of their stock to see what the market will do.
   For instance, the price of a 132-pound bag of Brazilian soybeans
has tripled since April, compared to an inflation rise of 68
percent in the same period. Inflation in Brazil is averaging 600
percent this year.
   ``The new international prices will signify a big boost in
revenues for the country, '' said Guillermo Alchouron, president of
the Argentine Rural Society, an association of the nation's most
important farmers and ranchers.
   But the Argentine Association of Grain Producers fears the
government may cut new-found profits by reimposing export duties
abolished last year.
   When Argentine President Raul Alfonsin denied such plans last
month, Alchouron said: ``Farmers were waiting for this message.
It's necessary to prevent the deterioration of a sector like
farming, which can bring the country out of the (economic) crisis.''
   One result of higher international grain prices is the rising
cost of farmland in productive areas like that outside Rosario,
which has doubled since January, Argentine farmers say. Brazilian
soybean farmers report similar trends even in the normally dry
northeast.
   Feed prices also have risen for poultry and livestock producers,
forcing some Argentine producers to slaughter their livestock or
reduce poultry stocks.
   Even the price of cookies in Argentina, the fourth-largest
consumer of cookies per capita in the world, has risen because of
the rise in the price of wheat, producers note.
   Curiously, Argentina's government has been low key about its
farmers' good fortune.
   The daily business newspaper Ambito Financiero of Buenos Aires
noted the government ``doesn't want to show too much euphoria with
all of this because it is negotiating for fresh funds with the
foreign lending institutions.''
   Hector Huergo wrote in Somos Magazine last month that Argentine
farmers would be wise to take their profits now.
   ``As Keynes said, in the long-term, we'll all be dead,'' Huergo
said. ``In the meantime, the question is how to take advantage of
the drought.''

   Richard Wade Farley talked about how he
might shoot up a defense company ``to wake them up'' about six
weeks before his alleged shooting spree there, a former co-worker
testified.
   Farley also referred to ESL Inc. engineer Laura Black as his
girlfriend, said Jerry Hirst, a computer technician who once shared
an office with two men who died in the Feb. 16 attack.
   Hirst testified Thursday in Santa Clara County Municipal Court
at Farley's preliminary hearing. Farley is charged with seven
murders and three attempted murders.
   His alleged shooting spree was motivated, Farley told police, by
Black's refusal date him after he spent four years trying to
persuade her to do so.
   Hirst said he thought Farley's comments were a joke. ``On
departing I said, `Well, good luck at finding your girlfriend.'''

   American diplomacy is in the midst of an
energetic and apparently successful peacemaking drive even as
President Reagan's term in office slips into the shadows.
   After years of strife, peace may be coming to southwestern
Africa, and to the Persian Gulf and Cambodia, as well.
   Wars are still being waged all over the world, of course, and
Central America and the Middle East pose intractable problems.
   But symbolic of the turnabout, the Ayatollah Khomeini, who vowed
in 1982 ``we will not make peace,'' said this week he was taking
the advice of high-ranking political and military experts and
accepting a cease-fire with Iraq, even though ``it would have been
more bearable to accept death and martyrdom.''
   In Southeast Asia, a promised withdrawal of Vietnamese troops
from Cambodia is bound to lower tensions, and there is a more
promising reversal, too.
   The Soviet Union, after saying for years what Vietnam did in
Cambodia was Vietnam's business, suddenly has agreed to discuss a
settlement with China.
   A successful meeting next month could clear the way for a
Sino-Soviet summit, propelling the world's two Communist giants
into a spiritual embrace.
   There is no sign yet of peace in Central America. Once again,
the State Department stiff-armed a request this week by Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega for a high-level meeting. Instead,
department officials invited Ortega to talk to the Contra rebels
who are trying to oust him from office.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will huddle Aug. 1 with the
leaders of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in
Guatemala City on ways to build up pressure on Ortega.
   The Middle East isn't very peaceful either. Violence on the West
Bank is rising, and while Shultz is making plans for his fifth
peacemaking veture to the region so far this year, the odds are
long that he can persuade King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir of Israel to enter negotiations under conditions set
in Washington.
   But in contrast to the usual gloomy news this has been a week of
dramatic peacemaking.
   Look at Africa.
   The agreement announced by South Africa, Angola and Cuba would
produce two long-elusive results: the withdrawal of up to 50,000
Cuban troops from Angola and the creation of an independent Namibia
after 73 years of South African rule.
   The plan brokered by Assistant Secretary of State Chester
Crocker also could lead to an early withdrawal of South African
troops from southern Angola.
   Crocker, the hard-working, former academic, took heat from both
left and right through the years. He was accused on the one hand of
not applying enough pressure on Pretoria and on the other of
favoring anti-Western black forces at the expense of the white
regime.
   Crocker has labored through months of negotiations in London,
Cairo and on Governor`s Island in New York Harbor. He knows how
peace dreams can fall apart. So he cautioned on Wednesday that
there was ``hard bargaining'' ahead on such issues as drafting the
text of treaties and a Cuban withdrawal timetable.
   Moreover, even if the agreement holds, the 13-year Angolan civil
war is not coming to an end. The United States will maintain its
support for guerrillas led by Jonas Savimbi who are at war with the
Marxist government in Luanda. Savimbi's UNITA rebels have received
$15 million in U.S. military aid since 1986.
   But the big picture is rosier. ``We have traveled a long
distance to get to this stage,'' South African Foreign Minister
Roelof F. Botha said of the three-nation agreement.
   The next round of negotiations is set for Geneva on Aug. 2.
While Botha cautioned that the road ahead was ``steep and full of
potholes and dangerous curves,'' an unprecedented expectation of
success has enveloped the State Department
   Officials who work at and worry over the Persian Gulf are
keeping their fingers crossed. They know the war between Iran and
Iraq could not be settled on the battlefield or through a United
Nations arms embargo. The fighting has see-sawed for eight years.
The Soviets will not allow an embargo to clear the Security Council.
   So all the U.S. chips are on Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar's effort to nail down the cease-fire Iran suddenly agreed
to after a year of vacillation.
   ``It opens the way to an end to the eight-year tragic war and
restoration of stability in a troubled area of the world,'' said
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary.
   To which U.S. officialdom murmured a prayerful ``Amen.''

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said today he has invited Iran and Iraq to send their foreign
ministers to New York next week to discuss implementing a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire and peace plan.
   There was no immediate reaction from Iran or Iraq, but envoys of
both nations have said their foreign ministers or other high
officials would accept an invitation from the secretary-general.
   ``I very much hope to see them early next week in New York,''
Perez de Cuellar told reporters.
   Iran, meanwhile, accused Iraq of trying to sabotage U.N. efforts
to end the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war by pushing for face-to-face
peace talks.
   Iraq has urged direct negotiations with Iran in New York before
a cease-fire goes into effect. Iran has rejected the proposal,
saying it only will negotiate through the secretary-general.
   The U.N. Chief declined to comment directly on the format for
negotiations, but Middle East sources said Iraq would be interested
in proximity talks through the secretary-general as intermediary
between the belligerents.
   Perez de Cuellar did not say whether Iraq formally has agreed to
receive a U.N. technical team to work out details of a cease-fire.
   Iran already has agreed to receive the eight-man team, which is
to arrive in Tehran Sunday from Jerusalem and Vienna. Iraq has not
made a similar committment.
   ``I expect the team to arrive in the area in the next few
days,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   There was no official word on whether Iraq would accept the
team. Iraqi officials said the U.N. request to receive the team is
under study.
   The Baghdad government has called for direct talks before a
cease-fire and has said that the visit of the team to Iraq and its
request for talks in New York were being discussed together.
   Perez de Cuellar said that after the team's weeklong visit he
would be able to set all the dates to put Security Council
Resolution 598 in motion.
   The resolution, passed a year ago, calls for an immediate
cease-fire, prisoner exchange, troop withdrawal, comprehensive
peace talks and an impartial body to determine which side started
the conflict.
   Iran announced Monday that it unconditionally accepts Resolution
598 and wants an immediate cease-fire. Iraq, which has said for the
past year that it accepts the resolution, now says Iran should
prove its sincerity in direct talks before a cease-fire.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati denounced Iraq's
new proposals as efforts to ``sabotage the peace process.'' He said
Iraq was trying to introduce ``extraneous elements which will only
complicate the whole thing.''
   ``Iraq wants to gain some more territory and leverage,'' he said.
   Iranian Counselor Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iraq is ``going
against its own statements endorsing Resolution 598 which calls for
an immediate cease-fire.''
   He said Iran has ``unconditionally accepted the resolution and
its implemention in explicit statements'' by his nation's highest
leaders.
   ``This is not a tactical continuation of the war and there is no
excuse for Iraq to delay implementation of Resolution 598,'' he
said.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz sent a five-point proposal to
Perez de Cuellar on Wednesday, calling for direct talks in New
York, Baghdad and Tehran.
   ``The request of the secretary-general to dispatch a mission is
under discussion in Baghdad,'' Iraqi Ambassador Ismat T. Kittani
told a news conference Thursday.
   But he refused to say whether Iraq would allow the team to visit
after direct talks were arranged.
   ``We are at a critical juncture and there should not be a
stampede to cease-fire _ that's only a small part of a
comprehensive and durable peace,'' he said. ``Pressuring Iraq would
be counter-productive.''
   He said that he was surprised that Iranian officials refuse to
talk directly with Iraq.
   ``With whom are they going to negotiate and sign a comprehensive
peace agreement?'' he asked. ``The secretary-general?''

   Eugenia Gerdes, a Bucknell University psychology professor,
tested the opinions of 64 college students told to act as jurors in
scenarios in which a college-age rapist attacks a fellow student
walking alone at night.
   ``They clearly think he did something wrong. They also think the
choice of a victim wasn't random,'' Ms. Gerdes said in an interview
Thursday.
   Forty-one of the students said the woman may have done something
to promote the rape, she said.
   Some students said the victim may have smiled at or flirted with
the rapist, while others said she shouldn't have been walking alone
at night or may have been wearing provocative clothing, Ms. Gerdes
said.
   She also found that women taking part in the study last year
tended to be more sympathetic with the victim and gave the rapist
tougher prison sentences.
   The 32 women in the study gave the rapist a 22-year prison
sentence, on average, while the men averaged a 15-year sentence,
Ms. Gerdes said. They were told not to consider the possibility of
parole, she said.
   All the students in the study were given typed stories they were
told were realistic accounts from a college newspaper. Accompanying
the articles were pictures of the purported rapist and victim.
   Ms. Gerdes gave each student one of two accounts of a rape. In
one, the victim and rapist took a class together and she recognized
him. In the other, the victim and rapist lived on different sides
of campus and never took a class together.
   In both cases, the rapist is caught in the act.
   ``Once people even think the rapist and the victim have been
together anyplace before, people begin to think: What made him do
it? What might she have done?'' Ms. Gerdes said.
   Twenty-three of the 32 students given the scenario in which the
rapist and victim knew each other said she may have done something
to promote the crime, according to the study.
   Even when presented with no evidence the rapist and victim knew
each other, students in the study suggested they may have seen each
other on campus, according to Ms. Gerdes.
   ``Just the fact that they are willing to suggest things the
woman might have done to provoke the rape, even when the defendant
is clearly guilty, shows that people still fail to understand rape
as a violent crime. They try to make sense of a random act by
viewing it as a sexual encounter,'' she said.
   Eighteen of the 32 students given the scenario in which the
rapist and victim are strangers said they thought the woman may
have done something to promote the rape, Ms. Gerdes found.
   Ms. Gerdes said she changed the pictures accompanying the
scenarios to give different combinations of attractive and
unattractive victims and rapists.
   Students believed an unattractive victim who knew her assailant
beforehand would be more likely than an attractive victim to have
enticed the defendant, Ms. Gerdes said.
   An unattractive victim was blamed less if attacked by a
stranger, she added.
   Students, especially women, rationalized that the victim was
less to blame if the rapist was unattractive, saying a woman was
unlikely to make sexual advances toward an unattractive man. An
unattractive rapist was the only scenario in which students
perceived the rapist as dangerous and antisocial.

<TEXT>
   Iraqis have the Arab zest for celebrating,
but there is little sign of jubilation over Iran's agreement to a
truce in an 8-year-old war that has cost Iraq hundreds of thousands
of dead and wounded.
   ``There was nothing. No reaction,'' said a European diplomat who
was in Baghdad on Monday, when Iran announced acceptance of a
cease-fire Iraq had sought for at least six years.
   Iraqis seem deeply suspicious of the Iranian decision, and the
government is insisting any truce be tied to a final settlement.
   Parades, celebrations and television specials typically greet
Iraqi victories in battle. None followed the Iranian announcement.
   ``I really want the guns to fall silent and for my dear husband
to come home,'' said Suad Mousa, 34, who has three children and a
husband who has been in the army since the war began.
   ``When the Iranians said they would accept the U.N. (cease-fire)
resolution, I really thought the war was finally over, but it seems
now it will take weeks and probably months before he will be
back,'' she said.
   Official news media and President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath
Party have encouraged caution, along with continued vigilance by
the military.
   The army has continued to fight, and said Thursday night it had
recaptured 33 northern hills lost to Iran in the early days of the
war.
   Iran said Iraqi units penetrated 12 miles into its territory
Friday. It claimed Iraq used chemical weapons and that Iranian
soldiers killed 5,000 Iraqis.
   Exultation is common here over much less than the end of a long
and costly war. Fusillades of tracer bullets lit the night sky over
Baghdad when Iraq defeated rival Syria in the Arab soccer
championship Thursday night.
   Wedding parties toot car horns and bang drums as they move
through the streets of Baghdad.
   Families are buying sheep to slaughter for the Eid al-Adha feast
that marks the end of Islam's season of pilgrimage to Mecca. The
date depends on the moon, but it is expected Sunday or Monday.
   Celebration of the war's end, however, apparently will have to
wait for a final peace.
   Diplomats in Baghdad say distrust of the Iranians, who accepted
a Security Council resolution they had rejected since its passage a
year ago, is rooted in thousands of years of conflict between Arab
Iraq and Persian Iran.
   Government officials also feel Iran may want a truce only as a
respite in which to rebuild their army, which has lost several
battles this year.
   Some cite Iranian statements that a cease-fire does not mean the
end of the war, which Iran's revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini sees as a crusade for his own vision of Islam.
   Iraq rejected proposals of a cease-fire two years ago when its
own forces were being battered near the southern city of Basra and
many observers felt collapse was near.
   It would ``certainly not'' accept a truce without real peace now
that it has the upper hand militarily, said a Western diplomat who
recently talked with Iraqi officials. He said Iraq insists on
direct peace talks with Iran as a sign ``of serious purpose.''
   A European diplomat said Iraqis are ``still going to be nervous
about the Iranians because the Iranians haven't been beaten'' and
still are ruled by crusading clerics. He said Iran ``could be
militarily quite potent ... within a year or two.''
   Although they are not celebrating, ordinary Iraqis are anxious
for the war to end.
   ``I am an old man,'' said 68-year-old Mahmoud Shaker at the
counter of his auto parts store. ``I have been running the shop for
four years, since my elder son was conscripted. I am very tired and
I want him back to the shop and with the family.''

   A grand jury indicted the wrong-way
driver of a pickup truck that crashed into a church bus May 14 on
27 counts of murder today, rejecting charges that could have
brought the death penalty.
   Authorities contend Larry Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, was drunk
when his truck collided with the bus on Interstate 71 near
Carrollton. Twenty-four children and three adults died after the
bus gas tank burst into flames.
   State police had charged Mahoney with capital murder, which
could have brought the electric chair. At the request of the
attorney genral's office, the grand jury returned charges carrying
20 years to life in prison on each count.
   ``After investigating into the law and evidence, we concluded it
would not be appropriate to make this a death penalty case,''
Attorney General Fred Cowan said. He did not elaborate.
   Mahoney also was indicted on 44 counts of wanton endangerment,
13 of assault and one of driving under the influence of alcohol.
   The victims died of smoke inhalation, Kentucky's medical
examiner, Dr. George Nichols, said today.
   Traces of alcohol in the blood of four victims probably did not
come from drinking but from a natural process _ fermentation of
blood sugar after death, he said at a news conference at Humana
Hospital University-Louisville.
   Nichols would not identify the four children by sex, age or
name. He has said none of the adults aboard the bus had been
drinking. Some of the crash survivors have said none of the young
people had been drinking.
   The bus owned by Radcliffe Assembly of God church was carrying a
youth group home from an outing at an amusement park in Ohio.
   Carroll County Commonwealth Attorney John Ackman Jr. had
recommended capital murder charges but suffered a heart attack
shortly after the accident, prompting the state attorney general's
office to take over the case.
   ``I'm sure he made what he thought was the best judgment at the
time, based on what he knew,'' Cowan said today.
   The state's chief prosecutor in the case, Paul Richwalksky, said
he met with more than 40 families of the victims Thursday night and
explained to them the less serious charge the state would be
recommending today.
   ``We had a frank and candid discussion. If anyone was
disappointed or disagreed, they didn't verbalize it to me,''
Richwalksky said.

   A triumphant Michael Dukakis and running mate
Lloyd Bentsen left Atlanta on Friday promising a 50-state campaign.
But several states will be clearly emphasized as the Democrats work
to piece together a winning Electoral College puzzle.
   Dukakis and his aides said all week that they ``would not
concede one single state to the Republicans in the fall,'' and in
appearance they won't. But concessions aside, the intinerary for
the first post-convention campaign swing is instructive for what it
says about Dukakis' fall strategy.
   Texas, California and Pennsylvania will be key battlegrounds,
aides said in a series of briefings this week. All three states are
on the schedule for the quick, cross-country trip Dukakis and
Bentsen began the day after they accepted their nominations. There
also are stops in Missouri and North Dakota _ tougher challenges
for the Democrats but an early warning to Republican George Bush
not to take things for granted, anywhere.
   ``Where we are strong, we will be highly visible,'' said one
senior Dukakis adviser. ``Where we are not so strong, we will try
to turn things around and if we can't we'll give the troops enough
ammunition to maintain a battle.''
   The war for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White
House likely will be waged on two fronts.
   Bentsen is up for re-election to the Senate and will spend the
bulk of his time running a dual campaign in Texas, something
Republicans already are criticizing. Dukakis aides said Bentsen
also will campaign throughout the South and Southwest, recently
Republican regions vital to a Democratic victory in the fall. While
doing the job he was appointed to do _ heaping praise on Dukakis _
Bentsen also will woo elderly and blue-collar voters with talk of
his key role in the passage of catastrophic-illness health care and
plant-closing legislation, Dukakis and Bentsen aides said.
   Dukakis, having signed bills balancing his state budget, will
spend much of the hundred-plus days before the election
crisscrossing the country with his message of competence and
economic opportunity. Campaign aides see victories in a half-dozen
big states _ California, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and
Pennsylvania _ as vital. Those states hold 175 electoral votes.
Texas, with its 29 electoral votes, is a crucial test that will
show the wisdom or lack of it in selecting Bentsen, and Dukakis
aides say they also think Florida is winnable.
   ``This is a truly national ticket, with a national message that
can win in November and will not allow the Republicans, as they
have in the past, to take any state for granted,'' Dukakis
spokesman Dayton Duncan said.
   A leading Republican critic of the Democratic ticket sees it
otherwise.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, like other Republicans tying Jesse
Jackson to the ticket, said Friday that ``the liberal candidates
will target the Northeast while the other candidate takes to the
South.''
   Dukakis left Atlanta with a double-digit lead over Bush in
national polls, but just moments after his optimistic and unusually
emotional acceptance speech, he cautioned delegates about
overconfidence.
   ``We're going to need you all,'' he told a post-convention
party. ``This is going to be a tough, tight, competitive race.''
   That ``all'' includes Jackson supporters. By next week the
Dukakis campaign expects to announce that numerous Jackson campaign
aides have joined ranks with the nominee.
   The additions will take over as state directors of the Dukakis
effort in several states, as well as co-directors and deputy
directors, said Charlie Baker, the Dukakis campaign's director of
field operations. A dozen state directors' posts are as yet
unfilled, including those in several states Jackson won.
   Baker refused to name the Jackson aides being recruited but said
he would have a list for Dukakis to review as he headed South, then
West, then to the Midwest, and finally back East with Bentsen.
   Dukakis, who insists on interviewing all prospects for top
campaign jobs, will conduct some interviews on the trip and others
shortly after returning to Boston, Baker said.

   President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari
says he hopes to strengthen Mexico's relations with the United
States, which have soured over drug trafficking, illegal
immigration and political differences about Central America.
   Salinas de Gortari also wants to expand economic ties with
Western Europe and Asia after he begins his six-year term Dec. 1.
The president-elect is from the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
which has governed Mexico since 1929.
   Although never smooth, relations between Mexico and the United
States reached their lowest point in decades under the six-year
term of President Miguel de la Madrid.
   The latest diplomatic incident occurred in June when Mexico
ignored an American request for the extradition of Puerto Rican
separatist William Morales, by releasing him from jail and allowing
him to fly to Cuba.
   The United States called the action an ``inexplicable affront''
and called Ambassador Charles J. Pilliod Jr. back to Washington for
consultations _ a gesture of great displeasure in diplomatic
practice.
   Earlier in de la Madrid's term, then-Ambassador John Gavin made
U.S. displeasure just as clear over the investigation of the 1985
kidnap-slaying of Drug Enforcement Administration special agent
Enrique Camarena Salazar in Guadalajara. Washington said Mexican
authorities were going too slow.
   Other irritants in relations have been Mexico's support of
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and its refusal to
consider the Central American conflict a result of the East-West
crisis, Mexican illegal immigration to the United States, terms for
Mexican foreign debt payments and alleged U.S. trade barriers to
importing Mexican goods.
   In speeches and interviews during the campaign, Salinas has
stressed the need for fence-mending.
   ``Due to geography, history and the wide scope of contacts
between both nations, relations with the United States will
continue to be of great importance in our foreign policy,'' he said
in one speech.
   For a start, he has been playing down Mexico's support of
Central American leftists, expressing hope the Central Americans
will be able to solve their own problems peacefully.
   He also has adopted a tougher attitude towards drug trafficking,
calling it ``a threat to our national security'' and promising to
do more to fight it.
   On the debt, illegal aliens and other problems, Salinas has been
urging serious negotiation. The United Sates is Mexico's principal
trading partner and Mexico is the United States' third, after
Canada and Japan.
   ``Beyond our commercial, financial and tourist exchanges, there
exists a huge network of contacts, a cross-border flow of persons,
ideas, goods and services (that) seem to have an existence in
themselves and are beyond the reach of our institutions,'' Salinas
said, adding:
   ``We derive mutual benefits from these contact, but we also
share the problems that stem from them. We shall give impetus, as I
have said, to the intensification of our economic and technical
links on a bilateral basis, under the principle of promoting more
friendly relations.''
   Salinas says Mexico will not take part in a North American
common market, which the United States and Canada are trying to
build. Instead, he says Mexico will take part in efforts to achieve
Latin American economic integration, and intensify economic and
other ties with Canada, the Pacific Basin and Western Europe.
   Salinas says the fact a majority of Latin America's countries
now have elected, civilian governments compared to a decade ago
when they were ruled mostly rightist military regimes is a good
sign for the achievement of ``economic integration and to the
building of a real Latin American community.''
   In Asia, he is setting his sights on China and, to a much
greater extent, on Japan, with which Mexico already has strong ties
in trade and economic cooperation.

   A judge today refused a man's request
to prevent his former girlfriend from having an abortion.
   Justice Joanne Veit of Court of Queen's Bench said, however,
that the man, Randy Mock, 25, could sue for damages for such things
as emotional trauma if 18-year-old Michelle Brandanburg goes
through with the abortion.
   Mock had obtained a temporary injunction preventing Ms.
Brandanburg from having the abortion. The 48-hour injunction
expired Thursday.
   Mock's lawyer, Rosanna Saccomani, had argued Thursday that the
two were bound by an oral contract when they agreed as a common-law
couple in February to stop using contraceptives so they could have
a child.
   ``There was an intention to create a child. ... That was what
the parties wanted,'' she said. ``She should continue with her
obligations.''
   The pair, who had gone together for 18 months, broke up in June.
Ms. Saccomani said that they still care about each other but that
Ms. Brandanburg's family opposed the relationship. She said Mock
was willing to raise the baby himself.
   Donna Oliver Dyck, who represented Ms. Brandanburg, told the
court that Mock had no rights as the father of an unborn child and
that the application to stop the abortion was ludicrous.

   An anonymous benefactor has paid the
garbage collection bill for an elderly couple, prompting the city
to call a truce with the ardent recyclers and restore their water
service.
   The city cut off water July 13 to Clarence James, 84, and his
wife, Dorothy, 82, under an ordinance requiring all residents to
have garbage collection, which costs at least $2.57 a month. The
couple refused to pay the fee, saying they don't generate enough
non-recyclable trash to warrant such service.
   City Manager Doug Zenor said he received $25 Thursday to pay for
reconnecting the couple's home to the city water system. He would
not say who paid the bill except that it wasn't the Jameses or a
city employee.
   Kim Nisbet, a secretary at North Lincoln Sanitary Co., said
somebody paid a year's fees for the couple.
   Calls to the couple's home went unanswered.
   Council members adopted the mandatory garbage collection law
last fall because people were using trash bins at parks and on
highways to get rid of household garbage, Zenor said. He said the
ordinancy has made the city cleaner.
   He said that before the ordinance, 1,600 to 1,700 homes had
water and sewer service but no garbage service. A number of homes
in this beach city, 75 miles southwest of Portland, are second
residences for people who live elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   A wave of ``retribution'' against smokers,
drunken drinkers and others whose actions are seen as a public
health threat could spread to AIDS victims by the next decade,
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said Friday.
   ``Such a response would be tragic, but not unexpected to the
health profession,'' Koop said.
   He cited the recent passing of laws to segregate smokers and
public ``retribution against drunk drivers, teen-agers who become
pregnant, drug addicts and wife beaters.''
   The anti-smoking attitude, he said, is being expressed in the
adoption of laws setting up no-smoking areas in restaurants and
banning smoking from entire office buildings and work places.
   ``These are examples of public retribution exercised against
smokers,'' he said, also telling his audience, ``Most Americans
would like to see all smokers stop.''
   Koop said it is possible that the American people, ``already
traveling the road of retribution,'' will extend that retribution
against AIDS victims in the 1990s, ``when the annual health bill
for the disease reaches $5 billion.''
   He did not say what retribution might be taken against people
suffering from the fatal disease.
   The challenge to health professionals, he said, will be to move
reaction to more responsive, productive and tolerant attitudes
toward those with AIDS.
   The surgeon general commented in a speech after receiving an
honorary fellowship from the American College of Legal Medicine.
   Asked if there was any good news to report about AIDS, Koop
replied: ``Nothing that you can see on the horizon.''
   But he said that one unexpected but potentially beneficial
result of AIDS research is that it is likely to produce
``spinoffs'' useful in treating other diseases.
   ``I think this will have tremendous benefits on other diseases
if we can shake the scientists loose enough to use them,'' he said.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus,
now called human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, discovered in
France and the United States.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases is attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of July 4, AIDS had been diagnosed in 66,464 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 37,535, have died since June 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

   A federal judge today gave the grand jury
investigating the Iran-Contra affair an additional six months to
complete its work, after federal prosecutors apparently indicated
they want to continue investigating Contra resupply operations in
Central America.
   U.S. District Chief Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. ordered the
jury, which would have been dissolved on July 28, to continue its
work through Jan. 27, 1989. That would extend its original 18-month
authority into the term of the next president.
   Robinson's order referred to a sealed request from independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and authorized the jury to deal with
``investigations identified by the government in its motion.''
   Walsh has been looking into an illegal operation to organize a
private arms supply network for the Contras fighting the Sandinista
government of Nicaragua at a time when U.S. aid was banned by
Congress.
   The grand jury a month ago indicted the CIA's former station
chief in Costa Rica, Joseph F. Fernandez, on five counts of
organizing the network. The charges also included unidentified
co-conspirators.
   Walsh has been continuing his investigation while preparing for
the trials of former White House aide Oliver L. North, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers
Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord for their roles in the sale of
arms to Iran and the alleged diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Walsh's spokesman, Jim Wieghart, said he could not comment on
the investigation. Specifics of the request for extension could not
be made public, he said.
   On Tuesday, North, Poindexter and Hakim petitioned the U.S.
Court of Appeals to have their indictments dismissed because they
believe testimony they gave to Congress under immunity would be
used against them in the trials.
   Attorneys for North, who is to be tried first, have appealed for
a delay of his trial from its scheduled start on Sept. 20 until
March 1989.

   Astronaut Sally Ride and poet
Gwendolyn Brooks will be inducted into the National Women's Hall of
Fame in a ceremony later this year, Hall of Fame spokeswoman Susan
Barber said today.
   Ride, 37, became the first American woman in space in 1983 when
she flew on the space shuttle. On her second flight the next year,
she carried a scarf from the hall of fame that belonged to aviator
Amelia Earhart, also an inductee.
   Brooks, 71, of Chicago, was the first black woman to receive a
Pulitzer Prize for poetry. She won in 1950 for her volume of poetry
``Annie Allen.'' In 1958, she succeeded Carl Sandburg as poet
laureate of Illinois.
   Seneca Falls, between Syracuse and Rochester, is considered the
birthplace of the women's movement because it is where a group of
protesters in 1848 wrote the ``Declaration of Sentiments'' calling
for equal rights for women.

   Video stores report that the Democratic
National Convention was great for business, as politics-weary
viewers lined up to rent movies.
   ```Enough already' is what my customers are telling me,'' said
Robert Tully, owner of a video store in Berlin. ``They want relief.
They say they don't want to see any more convention.''
   He said rentals increased about 25 percent between the start of
the convention in Atlanta on Monday and its close Thursday night.
   Other store owners surveyed by The Hartford Courant said sales
were up 10 percent to 30 percent during convention week, although
some said rainy weather probably contributed to the increase.
   ``All these customers started coming in, so I asked them what
was up. I'd forgotten completely about this week,'' said Tim
Carter, manager of a store in East Hartford.
   ``They took out a lot of old comedies and older movies and said
they just couldn't take any more of the convention.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan moved today to
impose trade sanctions on Brazil for denying patent protection to
U.S. and other foreign pharmaceutical firms.
   ``The United States cannot tolerate the piracy of its
intellectual property,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwatezr
said in a statement issued as Reagan vacationed at his ranch north
of here.
   The president's action means that the United States will hold
hearings to determine what penalties to impose for Brazil's alleged
trade infractions.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the hearings would
determine what products would be subject to sanctions.
   He said Brazil eliminated patent protection for pharmaceuticals
in 1945 and for pharmaceutical processes in 1969.
   The president acted at the request of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, a Washington-based trade organization.
Fitzwater said U.S. companies lose an estimated $36 million a year
because of Brazilian policies that permit unahtorized copying of
pharmaceutical products and processes that were invited by U.S.
firms. Eighteen of the association's members do business in Brazil.
They claim losses including lost export sales, unrecovered research
costs and reduced profit margins.
   Today was the deadline for the administration to complete its
investigation of the charges.
   Reagan said his action was part of a three-year campaign by the
United States to challenge infringement of its intellectural
property rights throughout the world.

   Two Italian ships will bring several tons of
unidentified toxic waste back to Italy from Nigeria's Port Koko,
Civil Defense Minister Vito Lattanzio announced Friday.
   The minister said he could not immediately say where or how the
toxic wastes will be disposed of in Italy.
   Lattanzio's announcement was expected to ease diplomatic
tensions between Italy and Nigeria and lead to the release of the
Italian freighter Piave, which was seized by Nigerian authorities
pending a solution of the case.
   The Nigerian government claimed hundreds of drums filled with
toxic waste were illegally taken to Port Koko while the Italian
company which shipped the waste claimed it had been authorized by
Nigerian officials.
   Lattanzio said one Italian freighter already sailed for Nigeria
while the second will leave within a few days.
   Last month another load of toxic waste was shipped back to Italy
after authorities in Djbouti, Venezuela and Syria refused its
disposal.
   The 2,100 metric tons of toxic material belonging to Italian
chemical firms are aboard the freighter Zanoobia, currently
anchored in the Italian port of Genoa.
   A metric ton is equivalent to 2,205 pounds.
   An Italian firm won a $5.3 million contract to dispose of the
Zanoobia's waste. Unloading operations have not yet been started.

   The leaders of Greek and Turkish Cypriots
in Cyprus will meet in New York next month for talks aimed at
resolving problems in the divided nation, Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar said today.
   U.N. officials said Georges Vassiliou, president of the Republic
of Cyprus, and Rauf Denktash, president of the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, will visit New York for talks Aug. 24.
   ``The leaders of the two sides in Cyprus have accepted my
proposal for resumption of talks to negotiate a settlement of all
aspects of the Cyprus problem,'' Perez de Cuellar said in a brief
news conference.
   He did not elaborate on his proposals for peace in Cyprus, which
has been divided since Turkish troops invaded in 1974 and captured
the northern third of the island.
   Turkish Cypriots, who comprise one-fifth of the island's 650,000
people, have formed their own breakaway state, headed by Denktash,
in the Turkish-  controlled territory.
   
   Several rounds of talks between Turkish and Greek Cypriot
leaders, under U.N. mediation, have failed to resolve disputes over
the form of a federation and withdrawal of about 29,000 Turkish
troops.

   Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Northwest
Permanente have been ordered to pay $3.2 million to a woman who
received substandard care during labor and delivery of her son,
born with mental and physical disabilities.
   An attorney for Kaiser admitted to a three-judge arbitration
panel that substandard care provided to Cheryl Ostergren caused
injury to her son, Keith, in January 1985. The award was made
earlier this month.
   Northwest Permanente is a professional corporation of physicians
practicing at Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. Ostergren first received
care at Sunnyside Medical Center and later at Bess Kaiser Medical
Center in Portland, both of which are operated by Kaiser.
   A complaint filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court alleged that
doctors and nurses failed to interpret fetal monitor readings
showing the fetus in distress. Attorney Keith Tichenor alleged the
baby should have been delivered by Ceasarean section or by use of
forceps.
   The birth was unreasonably delayed, resulting in mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, and mental and physical development
delay, according to the complaint.
   Evidence presented at a hearing indicated the child will need
lifelong care.
   The case was removed from circuit court to arbitration under
terms of a Kaiser contract with patients calling for arbitration of
claims of more than $500 against Kaiser or Northwest Permanente
physicians and surgeons.
   Arbitrators Pat Dooley, a retired circuit court judge, and
lawyers Charles Paulson and David Landis on July 13 set damages at
$3,230,000.

<HEAD>Justice Department Decides Against Burns Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has concluded there is
no basis on which to conduct a criminal investigation of former
Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns for promoting his former law
partner for a judgeship, sources said Friday.
   The criminal division's public integrity section reached the
conclusion, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
after reviewing information about the relationship between Burns
and Stuart Summit, who has been nominated to the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New York.
   Burns was still receiving payments from the law firm and had
investments in limited partnerships with Summit at the time he was
urging Summit's nomination last year.
   Burns resigned in protest in March over a different issue _ the
continued leadership of the department by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, who then was under an independent counsel's
investigation for alleged conflicts of interest. That probe
concluded without indictment, though independent counsel James
McKay said Meese ``probably'' violated the law on four occasions.
Meese has since announced his own resignation, but insisted that he
was vindicated.
   The Washington Times disclosed Burns' support for Summit in
articles last month, suggesting the former deputy attorney general
might have violated federal conflict-of-interest law.
   When asked about the public integrity section's decision, Summit
said he was ``not surprised, there never was anything to it'' and
said he was pleased about the outcome.
   Burns and former criminal division chief William Weld plan to
testify next Tuesday about their March 29 protest resignations.
   They quit out of concern that the continued tenure of Meese was
hurting Justice Department operations and morale.
   Congressional sources and sources close to the Justice
Department have said the leaking of unfavorable information about
Burns and Weld has been an attempt to discourage them from
testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   The Washington Times this month disclosed that Weld had been the
focus of an internal Justice Department investigation into whether
he smoked marijuana at a wedding in 1982. Weld has emphatically
denied the allegation, made in an anonymous letter, and the
department's Office of Professional Responsibility closed the
matter.

<HEAD>Mexican Offical Allowed DEA Agent's Killer To Go Free, Documents
Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who allegedly ordered the murder of a
U.S. drug agent was allowed to escape by a Mexican police official
who embraced him at an airport and sent him on his way, court
documents charge.
   According to the documents filed Thursday in U.S. District
Court, reputed Mexican drug trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero was
involved in a standoff with federal Drug Enforcement Agents and 20
to 30 Mexican police officers when the police official, Armando
Pavon Reyes, intervened.
   Authorities had caught up with Caro Quintero as he was about to
escape from the country from a Guadalajara airport, the documents
say. Both the officers and Caro Quintero's people had guns drawn
when Pavon Reyes embraced the reputed drug kingpin, according to
the documents.
   Caro Quintero, suspected of ordering the February 1985 murder of
DEA agent Enrique Camarena, then reportedly got on an airplane and
left.
   He was captured in Costa Rica in April 1985 after a brief
shootout with police.
   The documents outline the prosecution's case against Rene
Verdugo Urquidez, Raul Lopez Alvarez and Jesus Felix Gutierrez, all
charged in connection with Camarena's kidnapping and murder.
   Opening statements in the trial are due next week.
   The documents say Camarena ``was repeatedly and severely beaten
about the head and face with a blunt instrument'' and was killed by
a blow to the head.
   Nine people were charged in the case but one, Ines Calderon
Quintero, recently was killed by Mexican police, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Roel Campos. Four others are in custody in Mexico.
   Pavon Reyes' whereabouts are uncertain. U.S. Attorney Robert
Bonner said he is in a Mexican jail, but Jose Antonio Gonzalez, the
Mexican attorney general's attache in Washington, D.C., said Pavon
is a fugitive.

<TEXT>
   The 470-mile Colorado Trail, 15
years in the making mostly by volunteers and winding through
aspen-covered mountain valleys, is to be dedicated this weekend.
   But some of its builders couldn't wait. They're already out
hiking.
   Spanning two-thirds of Colorado, the Colorado Trail passes
through five national forests, cross the Continental Divide five
times and skirts not only 14,000-foot Rocky Mountain peaks but also
historical sites, ghost towns and environmental no man's lands
scarred during the mining boom days.
   Most of the trail was built by 3,000 volunteers, said Dennis
Neill, a Forest Service spokesman. Many spent entire weeks of
vacation clearing brush and building trail.
   ``The Forest Service did the dangerous stuff, like blasting
rocks and chain-sawing trees, but the volunteers brought in by the
Friends of the Colorado Trail Foundation did the real work,'' Neill
said.
   The trail begins at Waterton Canyon southwest of Denver, and
climbs gradually over Kenosha Pass to Breckenridge. Then it wends
its way toward Copper Mountain near Leadville and past a cluster of
14,000-foot peaks west of Buena Vista and Salida.
   It turns southwest near Saguache and veers toward Molas Pass,
near 11,000-foot-elevation Silverton, before dropping into the
Animas River drainage in the San Juan Mountains to Durango, in
southwestern Colorado.
   The trail has been a struggle since its inception in 1973 when
Bill Lucas, then regional forester in Denver, and a group of hikers
hashed out the idea one evening.
   The Forest Service was being criticized for providing only the
extremes of recreation _ rugged wilderness treks or roadside
camping.
   Lucas' idea was to use trails to link major tourist centers. A
hut system would be developed so hikers would not have to lug tents
and stoves.
   ``The huts are still a long way off,'' Neill said.
   At first, plans called for the Colorado Trail to be finished in
1978, two years after it was launched as one of the state's
centennial-year projects. The foundation bearing its name collected
its first $150,000 easily, including a $100,000 grant from the
Denver-based Gates Foundation.
   But the foundation did not get anything done because of
``unrealistic expectations,'' said Mayo ``Butch'' Sontermeyer, a
Fort Collins lawyer who served on the foundation board from its
beginning.
   About the time the foundation sort of fell apart, Gudy Gaskill
of Evergreen, who had been involved from the beginning, decided to
take charge of the volunteer effort.
   Gaskill, now 61, organized crews to clear a mile of trail a
week. By using volunteer labor, she and the Colorado Mountain Club
got the work done for $500 a mile, compared with the $8,000 per
mile she estimated it would cost the Forest Service.
   ``You can't say enough about Gudy's leadership,'' Neill said.
``She can out-walk, out-run and out-work anybody half her age. I
know, because she did it to me.
   ``I'd call it her fanatical attachment to a dream. She got
things moving again and the bulk of the trail work has been done in
the last four years, since she, (former Gov. Richard) Lamm and
(then regional forester) Jim Torrence got things rolling again.''
   Gaskill couldn't be reached for an interview this week because
she was out hiking her trail. She was expected to reach Durango in
time for a dedication ceremony Saturday at the Junction Creek
Trailhead, five miles northwest of town.
   A second ceremony, Sunday at Waterton Canyon near Denver, is to
feature the arrival of four Durango residents who have spent the
last two weeks running the trail.
   In a previous interview, Gaskill said the trail is a historical
route, ``showing what happened in Colorado.''
   ``It goes by record devastation such as Climax (open pit
molybdenum mine), timber cuts and burned areas, as well as splendid
pristine areas,'' she said.
   ``It shows the whole spectrum of the backcountry,'' she said.
``There are areas close to historical sites and others close to
man-made environmental damage, as well as reforestation sites where
major forest fires occurred. We go near or through three ghost
towns and three mining towns.''

   A car bomb exploded near a Syrian
military base in Moslem west Beirut during morning rush hour
Friday, killing 10 people, wounding 51 and destroying more than a
dozen cars, police said.
   Thirty-three pounds of explosives concealed under the rear seat
of a yellow Mercedes-Benz and connected to a timing device went off
at 10:40 a.m. in the working-class Cola neighborhood, they said.
   The blast occurred between a pharmacy and a gas station about 20
yards from the Syrian military intelligence base and a Syrian
checkpoint erected at the entrance, police said.
   ``We have not been informed of any Syrian casualties,'' said a
police officer on the scene, who could not give his name according
to police regulations.
   Reporters counted 19 parked cars destroyed, six of them gutted
down to smoldering piles of metal. Glass shards littered the
bloodstained main Cola street as civil defense rescuers collected
parts of human bodies torn apart by the explosion.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which appeared
aimed at discrediting Syria's law-enforcing mission in the Moslem
sector of the Lebanese capital.
   It was the 10th car-bombing in violence-ridden Lebanon this
year, bringing the overall casualty toll in such attacks to 106
dead and 354 injured.
   Most of the victims in Friday's blast were Lebanese civilians
from the gas station and three adjacent high-rise apartment
buildings that sustained severe damage, he said. The driver of the
car was also killed.
   ``We saw something like lightning and then an ear-splitting
blast rained glass shards on us. We were flat on our bellies,''
said Ahmad Muti, an employee at the Cola gas station.
   Syrian troops, armed with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47
assault rifles, sealed off the blast scene. They fired their in the
air to make way for ambulances rushing victims to hospitals.
   At least three Lebanese news photographers were beaten by Syrian
soldiers as they tried to shoot pictures of the wreckage.
   In the last car-bombing four days ago, a car blew up in
Christian east Beirut's Ashrafiyeh residential district, killing a
civilian and wounding another.
   Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war, pitting Moslems against
Christians, has claimed more than 130,000 lives since it broke out
in 1975.

<TEXT>
   In a last-minute, high-pressure deal, aides to
Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson agreed Friday to expand the
Democratic National Committee by nearly twice as many positions as
the two camps had come to terms on earlier this week.
   Jackson, the runner-up to Dukakis for the presidential
nomination, took the majority of the new seats, as expected under
the agreement worked out by the two candidates and announced Monday.
   After more than two hours, the committee went along with the
plan to add two new vice chairs and 20 new at-large members.
   And in addition, DNC Chairman Paul Kirk named Jackson's son,
Jesse Jackson Jr., to another at-large slot.
   ``This is a time we need everyone. We must have everyone for
victory in November,'' Kirk said. ``This will be a further
expansion of our party.''
   The new vice chairman of the party for voter registration is New
Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy.
   The new vice chairman representing the state party officials is
Rick Weiner, head of the Michigan party.
   Barthelemy backed Jackson and Weiner voted for Dukakis at the
convention.
   The new at-large members include Jackson aides Ron Brown, Willie
Barrow, Yolanda Carraway and Toney Anaya.
   The new at-large members from the Dukakis camp include John
Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union;
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, and Dukakis aide
Susan Brophy.
   The changes in the national party's structure are intended to
meet the presidential runner-up's demand that the DNC be more
reflective of the rank and file.
   All these changes had to be written into the party's charter and
were adopted without dissent.

<HEAD>Jackson Warns He's Prepared to Turn on `Street Heat'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson on Friday began to fulfill his
pledge of Democratic unity but warned Michael Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen that he is prepared to turn on the ``street heat'' to make
sure they heed his followers' agenda.
   In a dramatic meeting with several hundred supporters, Jackson
presented the newly nominated Dukakis-Bentsen ticket with
magnanimous words of praise and assured the delegates, ``It is in
order and it is right to support this ticket because of our access
to it and relationship with it.''
   But Jackson also cited historical precedent that social change
comes from a combination of leadership and ``street heat.''
   He promised that through registering millions of voters this
year, ``There will be enough heat to cook our meat and enough heat
for George Bush to get out of the kitchen.''
   To Dukakis and Bentsen, Jackson said somberly, ``You ask us
trust you. All that we can ask of anyone is that they not betray
that trust.''
   He told his supporters:
   ``I feel hopeful. ... I feel secure, confident you will be
protected in your role in the campaign,'' in the newly expanded
Democratic National Committee, and in ``the role I choose to serve,
one that is supportive, one that is respected and that's enough.''
   He added that he and his supporters had gained respect and
access, and ``we've never had those two things before.''
   The Jackson delegates reacted warmly to Dukakis, but were more
subdued during Bentsen's brief remarks.
   Dukakis recalled that Bentsen had earned his civil rights
stripes years ago as one of the two senators who voted to kill the
poll tax.
   Dukakis then appealed for the group's support.
   ``We're going to need you. We want you. We can't win without
you,'' Dukakis said.
   Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., set a tone of acceptance for
Dukakis. The congressman delivered a moving tribute to Jackson and
said that while the group had wanted Jackson in the White House,
``Last night, I saw a man mount the podium and react to Jesse
Jackson with dignity and respect unheralded.''
   The room erupted in applause and cheers of ``Duke, Duke,'' in
the first sign that the ice was being broken for Dukakis, who
lauded Jackson and his family in a speech Thursday night.
   Jackson introduced Dukakis to the room as ``a man I've come to
know and respect ... a man I've come to know in great detail and
love because of his own sensitivity to family and the people.''
   Walking a line in which he tried to build enthusiasm for Dukakis
at the same time as he put the nominee on notice that pressure for
his own agenda would continue, Jackson said:
   ``I bring to you the man I intend to watch up close on a cold
day Jan 20, 1989, when he becomes and deserves to become the next
president of the United States of America.''
   Jackson emotionally noted Dukakis' wish that his immigrant
father could have seen him nominated for the presidency.
   With eyes glistening and a catch in his voice, Jackson said that
by the same token, ``I wish Dr. (Martin Luther) King could have
been here'' for the Democratic convention that saw Jackson come in
a respectable second to Dukakis.
   Acknowledging that some of his backers were bitterly
disappointed when Dukakis did not pick him for his running mate,
Jackson said, ``The victory lies not in what Gov. Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen can do for us. The victory lies in the fact that our minds
have changed about ourselves and our reasonable expectations have
been expanded.''
   He reiterated that he does not want a job or title in a Dukakis
administration or campaign. Instead, he said, ``I want to serve,
(be) free to serve at my own pace, free to support, free to
challenge.''
   Jackson made what may have been hints about his own future
plans, noting as he often has the historical significance of his
candidacy in the evolution of blacks' power that began decades ago
with the civil rights struggles. ``We have every reason to be
hopeful, to be excited. Know that we are close to where we are
going, a long time from where we started and in our lifetime, you
and I will be in the White House.''
   Later he said, ``We are well on our way. ... I don't feel no
ways tired. Even (President) Reagan ran three times, tired as he
was,'' he added in what the crowd seem to interpret as a hint of a
future presidential bid.

   An attorney for the Christic Institute filed formal
notice Friday that he will appeal the dismissal of a $24 million
lawsuit against some Iran-Contra figures alleging guns-for-drugs
deals and a 1984 terrorist bombing.
   The Christic Institute will appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals a June 23 ruling by Chief U.S. District Judge
James Lawrence King that the plaintiffs, journalists Tony Avirgan
and Martha Honey had failed to prove their allegations, said
attorney Daniel Sheehan.
   The group is representing the journalists, who filed suit
against 29 people, including Richard Secord and Albert Hakim,
Contra leader Adolfo Calero, former CIA deputy director of
operations Theodore Shackley, and retired major general and
anti-communist crusader John K. Singlaub.
   ``The bottom line is that something in excess of 90 percent of
summary judgments by trial judges are reversed,'' said Sheehan.
``The major purpose of the appeal is to get the case reinstituted
and expand the scope of the trial.''
   Sheehan said he has 10 days to file the appeal.
   The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the
Iran-Contra affair became public. Many of the people it brought to
light, such as Secord, Hakim, Calero and Singlaub, have been
indicted or forced to appear before congressional committees
investigating that case.
   The suit involved heroin smuggling from Laos, the ``Phoenix''
assassination program in Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, cocaine
smuggling from Colombia, illegal Contra arms running, bombings,
threats, disappearances -all to push what the plaintiffs believed
was an activist right-wing ideology.
   It alleges that Shackley and others, using drug profits,
assassinated officials first in Vietnam, then Iran, Nicaragua and
other nations.
   The key event in the suit was the May 1984 bombing of a news
conference held by Contra commander Eden Pastora in La Penca,
Nicaragua. Three journalists and five Pastora supporters died.
Avirgan was hurt and his camera damaged in the explosion, allowing
him to file a civil damage suit under federal law.
   The suit charged the bombing was arranged by Shackley, Contra
leaders and others angry that Pastora refused to join
anti-Sandinista groups he considered too close to the CIA and
deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
   An attorney for Singlaub, Thomas Spencer Jr., alleged the
lawyers who filed the suit were guilty of bad faith and asked King
this week to penalize them. He said the Christic Institute, as well
as other plaintiffs, should be liable for more than $275,000 in
legal fees and $88,000 in expenses for Singlaub alone.
   Total fees for all defendants have been estimated at more than
$800,000.

   The government imposed martial law on the
central city of Prome on Friday after a week of Moslem-Buddhist
rioting that left one person dead and six injured.
   Government radio announced that a state of emergency also was
imposed on the city, which is 180 miles north of the capital.
   Rioting broke out there July 16 and spread to nearby villages
after a fight between a Buddhist customer and Moslem shop owner. No
details were released on the reason for the fight.
   ``Since the situation has developed beyond the control of the
local civil administration, the council of state placed Prome
township under martial law with effect from 6:00 p.m. July 22, with
a view to maintaining law and order and to prevent religious
riots,'' the announcement said. About 200,000 people live in Prome.
   A curfew was still in effect in Taunggyi, where a quarrel
between a Buddhist monk and Moslem youths sparked a riot July 11 in
which four people were killed and 20 wounded.
   Those riots followed unrest in Rangoon, the capital, in March
and June involving students from various universities and
educational institutions.
   The government closed nearly all universities and colleges after
the unrest and imposed a dawn-to-dusk curfew in the capital.
Hundreds of people were arrested.
   The protests appeared to reflect mounting opposition to the
authoritarian rule of U Ne Win, who seized power 26 years ago in a
military coup.

<HEAD>Bald Eagle Raised By Massachusetts Found Shot In West Virginia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young bald eagle raised in
Massachusetts as part of an attempt to re-establish a breeding
population has been found shot dead in West Virginia, officials
said.
   Three of 35 bald eagles the state has raised and released since
1982 at the 38-square-mile Quabbin Reservoir in western
Massachusetts are known to have died, said state ornithologist
Bradford G. Blodget.
   One died of mercury poisoning and the other drowned after being
caught in a leg-hold trap, he said. The carcass of the latest
victim and that of a second bald eagle were found late last month
in a sinkhole in a mountainous portion of West Virginia, he said.
   The birds were believed shot in early 1987. The Massachusetts
eagle was still carrying a radio transmitter attached to its
tailfeathers when it was released July 12, 1986, he said.
   Under federal law, the maximum penalty for killing a bald eagle
is a $20,000 fine and a year in jail.
   Blodget said a number of eagles have been shot in the isolated
sheep farming area of West Virginia.
   ``A lot of people erroneously believe that eagles kill young
lambs,'' he said. ``They don't. They mainly feed on carrion and
fish.''
   Young eagles can travel for thousands of miles in the first few
years of their life, he said, but most end up nesting where they
were raised.
   Two pairs of eagles, including some birds raised at the
reservoir, built nests at the Quabbin this spring, the first eagles
to do so in at least 80 years, but both pairs were too young to lay
eggs, Blodget said.
   This summer the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife is
rearing the last batch of six young eagles in the 7-year-old
project. Those birds will be released next month.

<HEAD>Drought Boosts Cost of Poultry, Eggs But Prices Still Rise at
Moderate Pace</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY17</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose at a moderate annual rate
of 4.2 percent in June, with the effects of the Farm Belt drought
showing up clearly only in poultry and egg prices, the government
reported Friday.
   The Labor Department said retail prices overall rose just 0.3
percent last month, the same as in May. Food price rises held to a
0.6 percent gain despite the biggest surge in poultry and egg
prices since August 1986, when the nation was in the midst of the
another drought.
   Offsetting increases on grocery shelves were a 0.2 percent
decline in energy prices and a 0.3 percent drop in clothing costs.
   ``I'd say the report is good news. It clearly shows that
inflation is not getting out of hand. It has accelerated over the
last year or so, but very gradually and very unevenly,'' said
Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
forecasting firm.
   The 0.3 percent seasonally adjusted gain in the Consumer Price
Index left the annualized inflation rate for the first half of 1988
at 4.4 percent, the same as for all of 1987.
   The index itself stood at 118.0 in June, meaning that a
selection of goods costing $100 during a 1982-84 base period would
have cost $118 last month, 50 cents more than in the preceding
month and $4.50 more than a year ago.
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., where President Reagan is vacationing,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``The data continues
to show no significant acceleration of inflation from the 4 percent
range that has prevailed in recent years. More good news from a
Republican administration has given you 68 straight months of
economic recovery.''
   Inflation worries have dogged financial markets in recent
months, with particular concern focusing on rising factory
operating rates and a tightening labor supply.
   Last month, factories operated closer to capacity than at any
time in eight years, raising fears that strong demand will free
manufacturers to raise prices. Meanwhile, unemployment fell to 5.3
percent, a 14-year low, and heightened concern that workers will be
able to get higher wages.
   The bond market showed little reaction to Friday's inflation
report, with interest rates slipping a bit in early trading. In
advance of the report, most economists expected a 0.4 percent rise,
with some correctly predicting a 0.3 percent increase.
   Since late March, the Federal Reserve has pushed short-term
interest rates up by about a percentage point, and its chairman,
Alan Greenspan, warned last week that the central bank stood ready
to tighten again if inflation heats up.
   Richard W. Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said in a statement that Friday's inflation report shows
that the interest rate increases are unjustified.
   ``Is anyone at the Fed listening? Does anyone down there look at
the evidence?'' he asked.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said that Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, were
unchanged in June following a decline of 0.6 percent in May and an
increase of 1.2 percent in April.
   In June, the 0.3 percent increase in consumer prices was offset
by an identical rise in average hours worked per week. The average
hourly pay was unchanged.
   The various adjustments left Americans' inflation-adjusted
earnings 0.2 percent below a year ago.
   Grocery prices in June were led by a 5.4 percent increase in
poultry and an even steeper 6.6 percent gain in egg costs. Cereal
and bakery prices, not yet showing the full effects of the drought,
were up 0.4 percent.
   Cooking oil prices were up 0.4 percent, while dairy products
fell 0.2 percent and the price of fruits and vegetables edged down
0.1 percent. Restaurant meal prices went up 0.4 percent.
   Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University in
Atlanta, said poultry and eggs are among the first categories to
show the effects of higher feed prices.
   Baked goods are slower to react because most food companies have
annual flour contracts, he said.
   Ratajczak, who conducts his own price surveys, said he had
expected meat prices to fall as farmers stepped up slaughtering
rather than pay for expensive feed. Instead, pork prices jumped 1.2
percent and beef was up 1.3 percent.
   ``Sometime between now and the end of barbecue season, the
supermarkets are going to have to give us some specials because
they have a lot of meat starting to pile up,'' he said.
   The department gave these other details of June price increases:
   _Clothing prices fell for the second month in a row after sharp
jumps in March and April. Analysts attributed the decline to large
markdowns in prices of women's clothing.
   Prices for infants' and toddlers' clothing were off 1.0 percent,
followed by a 0.8 percent drop in the costs of women's and girls'
clothing and a 0.1 percent dip in men's and boys' clothing.
   _Gasoline prices fell 0.9 percent and, fuel oil was down 0.6
percent, while natural gas and electricity costs gained 0.4 percent.
   _Housing costs rose 0.3 percent, the same as in May and April.
   _Medical care expenses were up 0.4 percent, less than in recent
months but 6.4 percent greater than at this time last year.
   _New car prices rose 0.3 percent, faster than the 0.1 percent
gains of April and May.
   _Excluding the effects of the volatile food and energy
categories, retail prices rose 0.4 percent in June, double May's
0.2 percent increase.

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA said Friday it is delaying the
launch pad test-firing of space shuttle Discovery's main engines
two days until July 30.
   The decision was made after shuttle managers reviewed
preparations and concluded that all elements were not ready,
including a hazardous gas detection system that is not completely
checked out.
   The 20-second firing of the main engines is considered critical
to certifying Discovery for the first shuttle flight since the
Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
   It will test modifications made in the engines and provide
countdown experience for the launch team.
   NASA officials said the delay in the test-firing could postpone
for a day or two the launch, now scheduled for early September.
   However, the status of the launch date is very much in doubt as
engineers are puzzling over how to fix a small gas leak in a
steering engine system that is separate from the main engines.
   They hope to make the repair on the pad and avoid rolling
Discovery back to a hangar, a move that could delay the flight by
as much as two months.
   Experts are considering several ways to reach the inaccessible
leak, from cutting a hole through the cargo bay wall to running a
snake-like tube through the gas line in an effort to plug the leak.

   New York's top environmental official Friday
said there is no single source for the medical debris and other
trash that has washed up on beaches in the New York City area in
recent weeks.
   The waste may have come through the sanitation system, from
untreated sewage, illegal dumping, littering from boats or some
combination of all these, said Environmental Conservation
Commissioner Thomas Jorling.
   An unusual, extended wind pattern also is partly to blame for
washing the debris ashore, he said in a preliminary report on the
waste that has forced the closing of miles of popular beach in past
weeks.
   ``There is no single answer that puts this thing behind us,''
Jorling said.
   The presence of garbage such as cigarette butts and condoms
mixed in with medical debris suggests the debris had more than one
source, Jorling said.
   He called it extremely difficult to trace the waste, which
includes syringes, rubber gloves and at least 10 vials of blood.
   One vial out of seven tested has shown the presence of the AIDS
virus, he said. Three more brought in Thursday were still being
tested, he said.
   Peter Slocum, Health Department spokesman, said none of the
vials tested thus far had any identifiable markings.
   Even if investigators find markings on the medical waste, it's
doubtful they'll be able to find and prosecute illegal dumpers, he
said.
   ``It's a very tricky case to make,'' Jorling said. ``You start
with an isolated blood vial on the beach some hundred miles or more
from any possible point of origin, and taking that blood vial back
through steps in a chain is a very difficult investigative burden
to carry.''
   On Thursday, officials in Monmouth County, N.J., identified an
Asbury Park sewage plant as the likely source of pollution that has
plagued four New Jersey seashore communities since last week.
   Beaches in Asbury Park, Ocean Grove, Bradley Beach and
Avon-by-the-Sea were closed by high levels of fecal bacteria in the
water.

   A blood bank has lost an effort to
protect the identity of a donor whose blood may have been tainted
with the AIDS virus.
   The South Carolina Supreme Court dismissed an appeal of an order
requiring the Carolina-Georgia Blood Bank to identify the donor
whose blood was used in a transfusion for Daisy Lee Young.
   Mrs. Young, 74, was being treated for AIDS-related symptoms when
she died at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center earlier this year.
   Lawsuits filed by her husband and her estate allege she acquired
AIDS from a transfusion received at Self Memorial Hospital in
Greenwood after a 1985 hip operation. The suits accuse the blood
bank and the hospital of negligence.
   Circuit Judge Frank McGowan Jr. ruled in May that the blood bank
had to release the name of the donor. The blood bank appealed,
saying the donor's right to privacy outweighed the plaintiffs'
interests.
   The Supreme Court refused the case July 8.
   The blood bank now is asking that McGowan to limit the questions
lawyers can ask the donor and that the donor be referred to as John
Doe in any court documents.
   Scientists say a blood screening test that came into use in 1985
has virtually eliminated the risk of AIDS from a transfusion.

   Honda on Friday announced a voluntary
recall of 279,821 of its 1984 and 1985 model Civic cars because of
a design flaw that could cause fuel leaks and what the company
called a small possibility of fire.
   Owners of the cars subject to the leak in the fuel pump will be

   The defect affects cars with carburetors and mechanical fuel
pumps. A crimped seam between the pump halves can begin to leak
after being subjected to internal pressure and engine temperature,
the company said.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, the Democrats'
shiny-new national ticket, began the general election campaign
Friday with the boost of high praise from Jesse Jackson. Republican
George Bush immediately tried to drive a wedge into the ticket,
citing ``tremendous differences'' between the running mates.
   With the week's peaceful and unified national convention as his
base, Dukakis crossed the Atlanta street that had divided his
campaign from Jackson's to ask for enthusiastic support.
   ``We're going to need you. We want you. We can't win without
you,'' Dukakis told several hundred cheering Jackson supporters in
a hotel ballroom. ``We have 110 days, and I hope we can enlist
every single one of you in this cause.''
   Then Dukakis and Bentsen headed to Texas, Bentsen's home state,
to start a three-day cross-country swing that was designed to be a
fast start for the Democrats' effort to win the White House back
from the Republicans.
   For his part, Jackson lavished praise on Dukakis even more
generously than he had in his campaign valedictory to the
convention Tuesday night.
   The Democratic presidential nominee is ``a man I've come to
know, to respect ... a man I've come to ... love because of his own
sensitivity to family,'' Jackson said. ``I bring to you a man I
plan to watch up close ... when he becomes ... the next president
of the United States _ Michael Dukakis.''
   Amid cheers of ``Duke! Duke! Duke!'' Jackson promised excitment
for the Democratic ticket in the fall and glory in the future.
   ``It is in order and it is right to support this ticket because
of our access to it and our relaionship with it,'' Jackson said.
``We have every reason to be hopeful, to be excited, to know that
we are close to where we are going, a long way from where we
started...And in our lifetime you and I will be in the White
House.''
   Dukakis delivered on a key Jackson demand Friday, as the
Democratic National Committee added new officials and new members
to ``expand the party.'' A majority of the new members were Jackson
backers.
   Jackson repeated that he wants no title from Dukakis: ``I want
to serve, free to serve at my own pace, free to serve, free to
challenge.''
   In Milwaukee, Bush praised Dukakis' acceptance speech at the
Thursday night convention session, but suggested there might be
internal problems for the Democratic ticket.
   ``I thought he gave a very good speech,'' Bush told reporters at
an Italian festival. ``He did a very good job.''
   The Republican vice president has gone out of his way in recent
days to praise fellow Texan Bentsen as a conservative even as he
has painted Dukakis as a liberal.
   ``The differences are enormous,'' Bush said, between the
Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates.
   Bush told reporters that ``an effective use for Lloyd Bentsen''
would be for him to persuade Dukakis to change his positions on gun
control, prison furlough programs and many other issues.
   Bentsen has also drawn praise from Jackson, desite their many
differences on the issues. But Jackson warned Friday that Bentsen
bears a heavy burden that accompanies the support from more liberal
Democrats.
   ``In a real sense, your occasion is now,'' Jackson told Bentsen.
``You ask us to trust you. All we can ask of anyone is that they
not betray that trust.''
   Even as Jackson praised Dukakis and Bentsen, he promised them
that there would be differences in the Democratic family, saying
the progressive agenda will be won with ``a combination of street
heat and leadership.''
   He promised Dukakis, ``There will be enough heat to cook our
meat and enough heat for George Bush to get out of the kitchen.''
   Dukakis was quick to point out that he and his running mate have
strong records on civil rights.
   The Massachusetts governor recalled the civil rights struggle
and spoke of his own experience traveling to Washington, D.C., in
1953 and seeing the intense segregation of the nation's capital at
that time.
   Then he emphasized that Bentsen, as a Texas congressman had
voted in 1948 to against the poll tax that was used to deny voting
rights to blacks.

  President Reagan will make his first

address on Saturday, the White House said Friday.
   The announcement by presidential spokemsan Marlin Fitzwater was
a departure from the usual White House policy of not announcing the
subject of the speech in advance.
   Fitzwater was asked whether the president watched Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis' acceptance speech on
television at his ranch north of here, where he is vacationing.
   ``He did watch and has no immediate reaction, although his
Saturday radio address tomorrow will give the first presidential
observations on the convention,'' the spokesman said.

   The Teamsters announced Friday that James T.
Grady of Boston has been named general counsel of the union,
replacing John R. Climaco who was closely aligned with the late
union president Jackie Presser.
   William J. McCarthy, the Teamsters' new president, said in a
statement, ``I have known Jim Grady for many years. He is one of
the finest labor lawyers in the nation, and he will be a tremendous
asset to me and the Teamsters Union.''
   The New York Times reported that McCarthy dismissed Climaco, the
Teamsters' longtime general counsel, in a face-to-face meeting late
Wednesday afternoon.
   The newspaper also said that McCarthy dismissed Dan Darrow, head
of the union's United Parcel Service division, a unit that
represents more than 120,000 members. McCarthy's statement did not
mention any such action.
   Both Climaco and Darrow were allies of Presser, who died July 9.
McCarthy, the union's leader in New England, was elected last
Friday.
   Grady, a prominent labor lawyer, represents McCarthy's home
base, Local 25.
   According to the Times, Climaco's dismissal came at a meeting
held in the union's headquarters here Wednesday to discuss the
government's suit against the union.
   The newspaper said the ostensible reason for Climaco's dismissal
is that he had not provided a more vigorous defense of the
Teamsters in the face of an intense assault by the Justice
Department on the union's activities. The government has charged
that the leadership of the huge union is corrupt and should be
replaced by a court-appointed trustee to oversee new elections.
   The government has named McCarthy as a defendant in its civil
suit, along with other members of the executive board.

   A former E.F. Hutton broker was
sentenced Friday to three months in prison and fined $3,000 for his
part in a money-laundering scheme at the firm's Providence office.
   Brian J. Lareau, 46, could have been sentenced to six years in
prison and fined $6,000. Under a plea bargain, prosecutors had
recommended no more than six months in prison.
   In May, Hutton was fined $1.01 million for its part in the
scheme.
   The penalty against the brokerage company, the maximum
allowable, was the largest money-laundering fine ever collected by
the federal government, U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond said at the
time.
   The illegal activity occurred before Hutton's acquisition last
year by Shearson Lehman Bros. The merged company is known as
Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   According to court documents, Lareau created a fictitious
account with a fake Social Security number and used it to conceal a
customer's money. Another former Hutton broker, Stephen S. Fusco,
was accused of helping organized crime figures launder illegal
profits.
   Lareau and Fusco, who died two years ago of cancer, helped
clients hide about $1.5 million in cash from the Internal Revenue
Service and Securities Exchange Commission, authorities said.
   Lareau admitted to laundering $183,950 from August 1982 to
October 1984. He worked at Hutton's Providence branch from 1980 to
1985.
   U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle also sentenced Lareau to
perform 200 hours of public service for one count of violating the
Social Security Act.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Take my deli _ please,'' comedian Henny
Youngman implored Friday, joining a pastrami war declared by his
colleague Jackie Mason.
   ``Go figure _ by me moving from one deli to another, it would
cause so much tumult,'' Mason said Friday.
   ``In most places, they have wars because of religion, race or
creed. Only in New York could they have a war over pastrami.''
   It supposedly began with a tiff over chicken soup from the
Carnegie deli _ a local landmark used in the Woody Allen movie
``Broadway Danny Rose,'' and Youngman's favorite breakfast haunt.
   ``A delivery boy from the Carnegie who barely spoke English and
didn't know who Jackie Mason was wanted to charge him for a
delivery of chicken soup,'' said a spokesman for the Carnegie, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``When I heard about it, we sent up a whole pot of soup,'' said
Carnegie co-owner Milton Parker.
   However, when Mason asked Parker to close the Carnegie so he
could hold a private party there, Parker declined.
   That, said Youngman, was a mistake. ``You get national
advertising,'' he said.
   Mason, who is on Broadway in a one-man show, retaliated by
staging a show-business bash at the rival Stage deli, which like
the Carnegie is on Seventh Avenue near 54th Street. Guests
including Joan Rivers, Jane Alexander and Phantom of the Opera star
Michael Crawford were treated to fish, corned beef, pastrami,
turkey and beef brisket.
   Mason ``had my pastrami and told me it's better than the
Carnegie's,'' said Stage owner Louis Auerbach.
   ``That's baloney,'' said Parker. ``The only thing he ever ate
here was chicken matzo ball soup or borsch.''
   Then, things got really ugly. Auerbach struck below the belt by
revealing that the Carnegie's famous New York pastrami was actually
made in _ Secaucus, N.J.
   ``New York water _ it's the best water in the country,''
proclaimed Auerbach, 63, noting that his pastrami is pickled in
that precious elixir.
   ``The New Jersey water happens to be good _ not quite as good as
New York, but our change in formula offsets that,'' Parker
contended.
   ``Every deli likes to brag about their own,'' notes Youngman,
who remains ever-faithful to the Carnegie's Nova (Nova Scotia
salmon) and cream cheese on a bagel.
   Mason said the trouble started after the Carnegie's popular
co-owner, Leo Steiner, died last year. At the funeral, Youngman
eulogized Steiner as ``the deli lama.''
   ``I loved Leo Steiner and ever since he died, it's not the same
at the Carnegie,'' Mason said through a spokesman, Mark Kane.
   The large, front table where old-time comics swapped shtick over
blintzes has been replaced by a four-tier, revolving cake stand _
stocked by a new pastry chef.
   Still, ``I always have a table there,'' said Youngman.
``Anywhere I want to make it.''
   ``I lost my wife last year. I go there to cut the
lonesomeness,'' said Youngman. ``I invite different people _ Milton
Berle and Red Buttons and Jack Carter.''
   ``Revenge is a very funny thing,'' he added. ``Years ago, after
the Stage changed hands, they wouldn't take a message for me. That
was the end of them for me.''

   A man was hospitalized in
stable condition Friday after he was gored by a bison in
Yellowstone National Park.
   Yellowstone officials said Thomas Fox, 41, of Bloomington,
Minn., suffered cuts and puncture wounds to his upper right thigh
and a broken right wrist after he was thrown in the air by the
bison Thursday night.
   According to witnesses, Fox walked to within 6 feet of the
grazing bison, trying to photograph it. The bison charged and threw
Fox into the air, officials said.
   Fox was taken to Lake Hospital in the park and was later
transferred to West Park Hospital in Cody, where he remained Friday.
   The incident led park officials to repeat warnings to visitors
that all animals in the park are wild and potentially dangerous.
   Officials said visitors should stay at least 25 yards away from
wildlife and nesting birds and 100 yards from bears.

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects Eight Soviet Missile Inspectors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight Soviets nominated by Moscow to inspect
U.S. military facilities under a treaty to ban medium-range nuclear
missiles were rejected because the U.S. government suspects they
are spies, a U.S. official said Friday.
   The eight were among hundreds of prospective monitors submitted
by the Soviets to oversee compliance with the accord signed in
Washington last December by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   About 80 inspectors have since been admitted to make
short-notice inspections at U.S. sites in Alabama, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Florida and Texas, while about two dozen
Soviet inspectors have begun a 13-year monitoring assignment at a
Hercules plant in Magna, Utah, where Pershing rocket engines were
manufactured.
   An equal number of U.S. monitors will be assigned to make sure
the Soviets do not violate provisions in the treaty, which calls
for the dismantling of nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles
to 3,600 miles and a ban on further production.
   The U.S. official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
said seven of the Soviets rejected last month had been proposed for
surveillance of the Hercules rocket plant in Magna, and the eighth
as a short-notice monitor elsewhere.
   The lists submitted by the Soviets included 600 names, but some
appeared twice or even three times.
   The list also included 200 names of prospective aerial crew
members whose job is to fly the monitors to the United States and
then take them home.
   Under the treaty, both sides have the right to veto prospective
inspectors without giving an explanation. The process is comparable
to the peremptory challenge of prospective jurors in American trial
courts.
   Kendell Pease, spokesman for the U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency,
declined to discuss the exchange of lists of prospective monitors
between Washington and Moscow.
   ``The specifics of what was submitted and was returned is part
of the privileged communication between the two countries and it
would be inappropriate to get into the specifics of it,'' he said.
   The Los Angeles Times reported the Soviet Union was not known to
have complained about the U.S. rejections.
   The Soviets' choice of the eight was seen by U.S. officials as
evidence that the KGB intelligence agency and its military
counterpart, the GRU, have not curbed their activities despite a
warming in U.S.-Soviet relations, the newspaper reported.
   The proposed inspectors had been linked to Soviet intelligence
activities in the past, but not necessarily in the United States,
the Times said.
   None of the U.S. inspectors was rejected by the Soviets, the
newspaper said.
   U.S. counterintelligence officials consider the Hercules plant
in Utah the facility most susceptible to technical and human
intelligence gathering barred under the missile treaty, the
newspaper said.
   ``The Soviets have (listening) platforms and agents on the East
Coast and the West Coast, but none in middle America,'' an official
told the newspaper. ``We want to keep it that way.''
   The treaty calls for the elimination of 6,000 Soviet missiles
and about 2,000 U.S. weapons within three years.

   An American group sponsored by
television personality Oprah Winfrey on Friday treated elderly
residents to a hot lunch that is to become a weekly feature in this
impoverished black township.
   Organizer Armstrong Williams said Ms. Winfrey has never been to
South Africa, but became interested in Alexandra after interviewing
Mark Mathabane, who grew up in the township.
   Mathabane went to the United States on a college tennis
scholarship and later wrote a book titled ``Kaffir Boy'' about the
difficulties of black life in South Africa.
   In South Africa, ``kaffir'' is a derogatory term for blacks.
   Ms. Winfrey donated about $7,000 to provide lunches for the next
12 months, Williams said.
   The township, with a population of about 120,000, is a
collection of shacks and garbage-strewn streets wedged among some
of Johannesburg's most affluent white suburbs.
   About 200 residents gathered outside a township house for the
luncheon, where another U.S.-based group, the Coalition on Southern
Africa, donated 43 boxes of books and clothing.
   ``We wanted to focus attention on the plight of Alexandra,''
said Robert Brown, a leader of the coalition and president of a
public relations firm in High Point, N.C. ``This is one of the
poorest and most ignored parts of the country.''
   Williams said Thursday that Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, was to attend the
luncheon, but she was not present.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan imposed trade
sanctions against Brazil on Friday in retaliation for that
country's denial of patent protections for U.S. pharmaceutical
products.
   Acting under a section of the Trade Act of 1974, Reagan started
a process which will lead to sanctions against $200 million worth
of yet unspecified Brazilian imports.
   Reagan's move came after what the White House said was a
years-long quest by the U.S. government and the American
pharmaceutical industry to persuade Brazil to enact ``adequate
patent protection.''
   Brazil has been unwilling to abolish a longstanding industrial
property code which holds that pharmaceutical products and the
pharmaceutical manufacturing process are ineligible for patent
protection.
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association petitioned the
government for an investigation, arguing that Brazil's refusal to
protect intellectual property rights has restricted U.S. commerce
and cost American pharmaceutical manufacturers more than $160
million from 1979-86.
   An administration official, commenting on condition of
anonymity, said the loss to U.S. producers is now running at about
$36 million a year.
   ``We regret that it is necessary to impose trade sanctions in
this matter,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement read to reporters here as Reagan neared the end of a
week-long vacation.
   ``But the U.S. cannot tolerate the piracy of its intellectual
property,'' he said. ``Over the past three years, we have
challenged the infringement of U.S. intellectual property rights
and denial of rights throughout the world.''
   Fitzwater said this policy has ``resulted in strengthened patent
laws in many foreign countries.'' He said ``this progress stands in
stark contrast to Brazil's lack of action in this area.''
   ``By denying this basic commercial right,'' Fitzwater said,
``Brazil permits unauthorized copying of pharmaceutical products
and processes that were invented by U.S. firms. This not only
deprives American companies of sales, it discourages investment in
the research and development of new drugs.''
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assocation said it welcomed
Reagan's move. The association's president, Gerald J. Mossinghoff,
said, ``the United States cannot permit its pharmaceutical industry
to sustain substantial losses as a result of Brazil's refusal to
recognize patent rights for pharmaceutical products and processes.''
   The United States had come close to slapping trade sanctions on
Brazil earlier this year, but backed away when that country
responded to complaints about its policies regarding importation of
software products.
   The administration official said the sanctions would more likely
take the form of tariffs against $200 million in Brazilian imports
_ as opposed to embargoing $200 million in that country's products.
   Reagan's order triggers a process through which the U.S.
government will hold public hearings to determine which Brazilian
products will be affected by the punitive measures.
   Fitzwater said the administration had given Brazil ``every
opportunity to change'' its patent policy. He also said that while
he did not believe Brazil would retaliate, ``that's always a
possibility.''
   Reagan has only occasionally invoked sections of the trade laws
to retaliate against countries suspected of engaging in unfair
trade practices, and Congress is near completion of legislation
that would revamp American trade laws.
   Reagan vetoed an earlier version, citing several factors,
including a provision requiring major employers to give workers at
least 60 days notice of layoffs and plant closings. That provision
now has been passed, as separate legislation, by both the House and
Senate via veto-proof margins.
   The White House has not said specifically whether Reagan would
veto the new plant-closing bill, although that is believed to be
his intention. Nor has it said whether he would veto the revised
trade bill, which is still pending in the Senate.
   Last year, Reagan imposed sanctions against Japan, accusing it
of dumping electronic products into the United States at
below-market prices and of refusing to open its own markets to U.S.
computer components and other such products.

   A federal judge who threatened a lawyer with
jail for using her maiden name in court is known for threatening
attorneys with arrest and calling them names, including ``dumb
Jew,'' lawyers said Friday.
   Senior U.S. District Justice Hubert Teitelbaum, 73, prompted
feminists to demand his resignation when he recently ordered
attorney Barbara Wolvovitz to use her husband's last name and not
use `Ms.' during a race discrimination trial.
   Attorneys who have tried cases before Teitelbaum said Friday his
courtroom antics began years ago.
   ``He's very bright. He's very knowledgeable in the law. But he's
very domineering. He takes over your case and tries it for you,''
said Pittsburgh attorney Harvey Daniels.
   Teitelbaum, a former U.S. attorney and FBI agent who first took
the bench in 1971, could not be reached for comment Friday. There
were no answers at either his office or home telephones. He has
consistently refused to talk to the press.
   Leonard Sharon, a former Pittsburgh attorney now practicing in
Auburn, Maine, said Teitelbaum ordered him arrested and called him
a liar in 1984 when he tried to file a petition, which the judge
claimed contained erroneous information.
   ``I didn't lie, but if he has facts that say I did, someone else
should'' have decided the issue, Sharon, 42, said Friday. ``He
can't pitch and call balls and strikes at the same time.''
   Sharon said his wife, Claudia, also an attorney, entered the
courtroom carrying their infant just in time to see marshals
surround him.
   ``Teitelbaum told her `You get out of the courtroom' and said
something to the effect that she should be home watching the
baby,'' Sharon said.
   The judge vacated his order.
   Sharon said he later was subpoenaed to testify before a federal
judicial panel investigating a complaint against Teitelbaum filed
by Stanley Preiser, a former Pittsburgh lawyer who now practices in
Charleston, W.Va., and Boca Raton, Fla.
   Sharon said he doesn't know the outcome of the investigation,
and Preiser said he was prohibited by court rules from disclosing
it.
   Preiser said Teitelbaum called him a ``dumb Jew'' during an
August 1985 hearing when he asked the judge to reschedule a case
around a Jewish holiday.
   ``He said `It was the first time I had known you were Jewish,
because I have never met a dumb Jew before,''' recalled George
Mahfood, Presier's co-counsel in the case.
   ``I was stunned and astounded,'' said Preiser, 60. ``That
courtroom was totally different from any other American courtroom I
had been in before.''
   Teitelbaum stepped down from the case after the two attorneys
asked the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to disqualify him.
   On Jan. 19, 1973, Teitelbaum sent federal marshals to the
Allegheny County Courthouse for attorney Allen Brunwasser, who was
finishing a trial in the local court. As soon as the trial ended,
Brunwasser was escorted to Teitelbaum, who jailed him for 48 hours
for contempt for not attending a hearing scheduled at the same time.
   Brunwasser served the time, but the 3rd Circuit cleared
Brunwasser of the contempt conviction.
   ``There is no more powerful man than an American judge sitting
in his courtroom,'' Brunwasser said. ``He is a king.''
   Meanwhile, Ms. Wolvovitz's clients, Charles Gavin and William
Sutton, who lost their race discrimination case against PPG
Industries Inc., said Friday they will act as their own attorneys
in an appeal.
   They claim the jury was prejudiced by Teitelbaum's comments to
Ms. Wolvovitz, who they said promised Teitelbaum she would not cite
the Ms.-Mrs. flap on appeals and won't represent them on that
ground.

<HEAD>U.S. Inspectors End Missile Inspections

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten U.S. inspectors on Friday
completed the first inspection of a former base for Soviet nuclear
missiles in this Warsaw Pact country, the official CTK news agency
said.
   The inspectors arrived Thursday after permission was granted for
the inspection at the central Czechoslovak town of Hranice, 180
miles southeast of Prague, in accordance with the treaty
eliminating U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range missiles.
   After signing a report on the on-site inspection of the ``combat
positions and other equipment'' used by units of the Soviet army
until spring, the group left ``with a Soviet and Czechoslovak
escort for Prague,'' the report said.
   A second group of U.S. missile experts arrived in East Germany
Friday to inspect sites covered by the superpower treaty, the
state-run ADN news agency reported in Berlin.
   ADN said the Americans were greeted at Leipzig airport by East
German and Soviet officials. It did not say where they were going
or give any further details.
   Twenty other U.S. missile experts arrived in East Germany Monday
to inspect sites. They left Wednesday.
   In Czechoslovakia, Soviet troops stationed with the SS-12
short-range missiles began pulling the weapons out in February,
even before the U.S. Congress ratified the treaty signed last Dec.
8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   CTK said Thursday the 39 missiles with a range of 300 to 600
miles and 24 mobile launchers were withdrawn from Hranice in
February and March.
   The base now houses a Czechoslovak army unit, CTK said.
   Col. Lawrence Kelly, identified by CTK as head of the American
inspection team, was quoted as telling the news agency ``all four
former action stations, including all parts constituting one
installation covered by the agreement, were checked.''
   Kelly reportedly praised the inspection as a step to strengthen
mutual confidence and understanding, CTK said.
   Under the agreements signed by the United States, the Soviet
Union, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, the inspection can take 24
hours and may be extended by another eight hours, the agency said.

told the newspaper. ``We want to keep it that way.''
   The treaty calls for the elimination of 6,000 Soviet missiles
and about 2,000 U.S. weapons within three years.

   Here is a sampling of foreign opinion Friday on the Democratic
National Convention, which ended Thursday in Atlanta, Ga.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Le Monde, the prestigious independent newspaper:
   ``In the euphoria of the Atlanta convention, the Democrats
celebrated their force and their best point for the upcoming
presidential campaign: unity ....
   ``In the image of its new champion, the cerebral and opinionated
Dukakis, the Democratic Party is no longer flamboyant but
`performance-oriented.'''
   Liberation, a leftist newspaper:
   ``The Atlanta convention adopted a platform which will count as
one of the shortest in the history of the party. General and
imprecise enough to permit interpretations and adaptations, it will
certainly not trigger a great debate of ideas ....
   ``(Dukakis) is also a simple man, economic, living like a middle
American, the ideal or almost the American dream incarnated by this
son of an immigrant. Does that suffice to preside over the destiny
of the world's first power, or at least is it the idea Americans
themselves have of their president? Dukakis has less than four
months to convince them.''

<HEAD>WEST GERMANY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Friedrich Bohl, a member of Parliament in the governing
Christian Democratic Union party, said:
   ``We welcome the fact that the convention has turned down Jesse
Jackson's call for rejection of the first use of nuclear weapons.
This decision is in the best interests of European and German
security. It is in line with NATO's strategy, which has kept the
peace in Europe since World War II.''

   Greeks reacted with restraint to the nomination of Michael
Dukakis, despite his Greek background. Newspapers published only
brief stories from reporters who attended the Atlanta convention.
   In a brief congratulatory message to the candidate, the
Executive Committee of Premier Andreas Papandreou's governing
Panhellenic Socialist Movement said ``the Greek people worldwide
were moved'' by the Democrat's presidential nomination.
   But residents of Pelopi, the small mountain village on the
island of Lesbos that calls itself the hometown of Dukakis, reacted
with jubilant song and dance and an all-night party at the news.

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government's newspaper, Barricada, gave
banner-headline display to remarks by Dukakis. ``Dukakis: Reagan
Era Ended,'' its seven-column headline trumpeted.
   In boldface print above a news agency story, the paper quoted
Dukakis as saying ``Sandinistas aren't a threat to U.S. national
security; it's drugs.''

<HEAD>ABA Asks Aquino to Probe Killings of Two Lawyers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association is asking Philippine
President Corazon Aquino to condemn the slayings of two
human-rights lawyers there.
   Lance Lindblom, a representative of the 340,000-member group,
was meeting Thursday and Friday with the Free Legal Assistance
Group of the Philippines and planned to deliver a letter signed by
ABA President Robert MacCrate, said Craig Babb of the ABA's
Washington, D.C., office.
   The ABA letter specifically mentions Alfonso A. Surigao Jr., who
often represents military detainees and was killed by gunmen June
24 at his Cebu City home, and Emmanuel Mendoza, 57, who was
ambushed in his car July 2.
   ``We respectfully urge that you publicly condemn these recent
attacks against human rights lawyers and that you order thorough
investigations,'' it says, citing ``reports that the Philippine
military may have been involved in the murder'' of Surigao.
   ``The American Bar Association is deeply concerned over the
murder of Mr. Surigao and Mr. Mendoza and the harassment and
killings of several other lawyers in the Philippines over the past
few months,'' MacCrate wrote.
   ``We are further concerned that, to our knowledge, there have
been no arrests in these cases, nor in the earlier killings'' of
three other civil-rights lawyers, he wrote.
   Baab said Friday he did not know if Lindblom had delivered the
letter to Mrs. Aquino. It asks her to inform the ABA of progress in
the investigations.
   The ABA has sent similar letters to other countries since 1975,
when it adopted a policy supporting the independence of lawyers and
judges around the world, Baab said. In 1985, it sent a letter to
Mrs. Aquino's predecessor, then-President Ferdinand Marcos, after
attacks on lawyers.

<HEAD>Nudes Or No Nudes: Law On Film Censorship Being Debated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Censors are debating whether to ban sex and
serious crimes from Chinese movies and are considering establishing
the country's first rating system to keep children from seeing some
films altogether.
   The rating system would protect younger children from movies
that could ``harm their healthy minds,'' the official China Daily
and Outlook magazine reported.
   A proposed law now would mark the first time since communist
China was established in 1949 that explicit standards have been set
about what can and cannot be portrayed in a Chinese movie.
   In the past, censorship changed with the political climate of
the country. When the country was ruled by hard-line leftists,
censorship was quite strict. When moderates took command,
censorship was relatively lax.
   Outlook quoted Chen Haosu, vice minister of radio, film and
television, as saying the regulations were needed to eliminate the
ambiguity surrounding artistic expression.
   ``If there's no law, then you can interfere with anything,''
Haosu was quoted as saying.
   But some artists in China say they thrive on the ambiguity,
preferring to work within the present vague situation where a
liberal turn in the political wind might allow a controversial work
to slip by.
   China produces more than 100 feature films a year and boasts the
largest movie industry in the world, employing 500,000 workers.
   In the 10 years since China began to open to the West about a
dozen movies have been ``killed'' by China's censors, Ai Zhisheng,
the minister of radio, film and television, told Outlook.
   Others have been revised ``with the help of the film company,''
he said.
   Outlook said censors agreed Chinese films should not hurt China
or the unity of its numerous nationalities, nor should they distort
history or exert an unhealthy influence on the morals of the people.
   But it said censors disagreed on nudity and crime.
   An article of the proposed law bans naked bodies and sex scenes
from all movies. But Outlook said some officials argued nudity and
sex should be forbidden only when they have no relation to the plot.
   Another proposed article forbids graphic descriptions of
criminal acts because officials fear they might trigger copy-cat
crimes. Outlook said some officials favored limiting the clause to
only serious crimes such as rape and drug trafficking.
   Outlook said some officials were also pushing to institute a
rating system for movies.
   ``There are many movies that aren't good for children or that
shouldn't be seen without the presence of an older family member,''
Chen was quoted as saying. He said China needed to establish a
rating system as soon as possible.

<HEAD>John Hersey Apologizes to Fellow Author Over Lack of Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MONROE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author John Hersey apologized Friday for using
uncredited material from another writer's book in a New Yorker
article on James Agee.
   Hersey said he should have credited some of his sources,
``especially Laurence Bergreen's `James Agee: A Life,' the most
comprehensive and thoroughly researched biography of Agee so far
published.''
   Bergreen had told his lawyer to complain to The New Yorker and
to Houghton Mifflin, which had commissioned the piece as an
introduction to a new edition of Agee's ``Let Us Now Praise Famous
Men.''
   Houghton Mifflin said in a statement: ``Mr. Hersey feels that
several of the sources on which he draws for facts about Mr. Agee's
life, beyond his own recollections, should be credited, and they
will be.''
   Agee, a critic, novelist, journalist and screenwriter, died in
1955.
   ``The facts that a biographer or historian digs up don't belong
to him. They belong to the public. Anybody has a right to use
them,'' Hersey said Friday in a telephone interview from his home
on Martha's Vineyard.
   ``But the one thing that is protected is the mode of
expression,'' he continued. If in the course of a 12,000-word
article ``I used a dozen or so words. ... I certainly did not
intend to steal them from him.''
   He said he thought there was ``a fine line'' between one's right
to use material and one's respect for the work of another writer
and that his offense was not great in terms of normal practice.
   Bergreen said he came across the July 18 issue of the New Yorker
during a lunch break and because ``I had interviewed Hersey for my
biography I turned to read it with considerable interest.''
   ``As I read it I discovered that there were a number of passages
which were very closely modeled on my own in the book. There were
numerous instances where he was using my phrasing, my choice of
words and structure and so on.''
   With the exception of an introductory anecdote about Agee, ``the
rest of the piece, which was a rather long one, amounted to a
condensation of my biography,'' Bergreen said.
   For example, Bergreen's book described a scene between Agee and
Alma Mailman, his second wife: ``Alma once tied a blue ribbon in
Agee's hair, as if he were a poodle. Forgetting the bow was in
place, he opened the door to converse with a delegation of church
ladies who had come a-calling.''
   In The New Yorker article, Hersey wrote: ``One day, Alma
pretended that Jim was a poodle, and tied a blue ribbon in his
hair. Some church ladies came to call, and Jim the poodle dressed
for showing went to the door and let them in.''
   Hersey confirmed that he had written the editors of The New
Yorker, saying in part, ``I very much regret any discourtesy on my
part, or any distress caused to Mr. Bergreen or others'' by his
omission of credit.
   Rhonda Pinzer, the public relations director of The New Yorker,
said the next issue would contain a Department of Amplification,
which is how the magazine deals with such questions. She could not
confirm that it would contain Hersey's letter.
   Hersey, who won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1945 with his
``A Bell for Adano,'' is the author of more than 20 books including
``Hiroshima,'' ``The Child Buyer,'' and ``The War Lover.''
   Bergreen also wrote ``Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network
Broadcasting'' and is working on a biography of Irving Berlin.

<HEAD>Deer Exasperate Some Boulder Residents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It used to be endearing, but the charm has
worn off for many Boulder residents whose backyards and gardens
have become the favorite haunts of increasing numbers of deer.
   ``When we started studying the deer in 1982, we thought of them
as seasonal and transient, but it seems we have a resident
population now, having fawns in people's backyards and sleeping
under decks,'' said Laurie Kuelthau, state Department of Wildlife
district manager of southern Boulder County.
   About 160 deer were killed by cars last year within Boulder's
city limits, an area of only about 16 square miles.
   City Council has received so many complaints of gardens ruined
by hungry deer that it plans to take up the issue Tuesday.
   Possible ways to curb the deer range from relocating them to
killing them and donating the venison to food banks. But city
officials say relocating the deer would cost $400 apiece and could
cause 80 percent mortality.
   Mountain lions which normally hunt deer won't thin the deer
population because they don't like to hunt so close to humans.
   In the past 10 years, the number of deer in the Boulder area has
swelled to double the deer population in the rest of the Front
Range: 50 to 60 per square mile.
   Brian Peck, a ranger and naturalist with Boulder Mountain Parks,
says the deer population has grown so quickly partly because the
city of about 100,000 people is built on several deer migration
routes.
   In addition, he said, the deer discovered that roses, tulips,
raspberries and other plants in suburban gardens are tastier than
mountain mahogany and wild grasses.
   Many residents still consider the deer evidence of a rapport
with wildlife in a town with a reputation for environmental
consciousness. Some people used to put out food and salt licks to
attract the deer, but the City Council passed a law in 1985
forbidding that.
   Kuelthau says most complaints are from gardeners, who in some
parts of the city report as many as seven deer in their yards at
one time.
   In March, Marie Aragon was fined $200 after she killed a deer in
her Table Mesa backyard. She said she feared that the deer
threatened her two toddlers, and she disliked cleaning up deer
droppings.
   But the deer have their defenders.
   A 1987 City Council survey found that 58 percent of those
responding wanted the deer to be left alone while 28 percent said
something should be done about them.
   ``Deer are one of the reasons I like Boulder,'' said Karen
Martingale. ``You lose some of your vegetation, but that's one of
the things you put up with if you live here.''

<HEAD>Former Federal Judge Seeks to Resume Law Practice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exactly two years after the U.S. House
voted to remove him from the bench, an impeached federal judge who
served 17 months in prison for tax evasion sought Friday to resume
practicing law in federal court.
   The Nevada Supreme Court in November cleared Harry Claiborne to
practice at the state level and his attorney, David Goldwater, on
Friday repeated the argument he used there, that Claiborne has been
punished enough.
   He should be allowed ``the basic civil right to make a living,''
and ``to be restored the dignity his profession affords him,''
Goldwater added.
   Jay Sourwine, president-elect of the Nevada Bar Association,
told U.S. District Judge Robert Broomfield, ``The Claiborne affair
has caused a great deal of damage to the bar and to the state court
system. We urge you don't let it do damage to this court.''
   Broomfield, of Phoenix, Ariz., took the matter under advisement
and gave no indication when he might rule.
   ``I think I have paid a price for a debt I feel I didn't owe,''
Claiborne, 71, told reporters. ``I was denied parole twice. I did
the mandatory maximum sentence that I could do.
   ``You don't go to a minumum-security prison unless you're
parolable. I was an unusual case, I guess.''
   He also joked about one of Goldwater's comments.
   ``I'll always make a living,'' he said. ``Even if I have to dig
ditches.''
   Claiborne was convicted of failing to report $106,651 on his
1979 and 1980 income tax returns. The U.S. House voted 406-0 two
years ago Friday to impeach Claiborne, who was removed from office
after an October 1986 Senate trial. He was the first federal judge
banished from office by Congress in 50 years.
   Claiborne charged at the time of his impeachment trial and again
Friday that he was the victim of a government vendetta because he
attacked agencies like the FBI and Justice Department Strike Force
while on the bench. He alleged misconduct by federal agents and
bias on the part of U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman, who
conducted his 1984 income tax trial and sentenced him to prison.
   The state Supreme Court, in its 163-page decision in November,
said Claiborne shouldn't be punished any further.
   He was named a federal judge in 1978.

<HEAD>Study Says Lesbians Suffer More Stress Than Heterosexual Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey of lesbian health problems found that
homosexual women experience much more stress than heterosexuals but
share similar concerns about physical and mental health, its
authors said Friday.
   ``It dispels some of the myths about lesbianism,'' said
co-author Caitlin Ryan, social worker and researcher.
   The National Lesbian Health Care Survey, undertaken with some
federal funding, was presented at the weeklong 10th National
Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS Forum, which ends
Tuesday.
   The survey by Ryan and co-author Judith Bradford of Virginia
Commonwealth University was conducted by sending 10-page
questionnaires to 4,600 women. The 2,000 respondents from
throughout the nation ranged from 17 to 80 years old.
   Eighty percent of the respondents were between 25-44 and about
70 percent were in professional or managerial jobs; 46 percent of
participants had one child or more or were childless but wanted to
have one. Most lived in metropolitan areas.
   Ryan said she had no error margin for the results because the
study was the first of its kind and because no one knows the size
of the base population of lesbians.
   ``The data indicate that lesbians are very much like
heterosexual women in their concerns about health care and mental
health concerns,'' Bradford told an audience of about 200 people
who attended the survey presentation.
   ``But it is quite different as far as access to non-discriminate
care, and the level of stress,'' she said.
   Among the study's findings:
   _Substance abuse among lesbians becomes greater as they age,
especially among the 50-55 age group. ``The older lesbians tend to
be very isolated,'' Ryan said. ``Their partner may die, and they
become very depressed and turn to substance abuse.''
   _More than one-third of those surveyed said they were physically
abused as a child.
   _Half said they have been verbally attacked and 8 percent
reported they had been physically attacked because of their
homosexuality.
   _Fifteen percent said they lost jobs because they were lesbians.
   _Seventy-five percent said they relied on some form of
counseling.
   ``The percentage of us who are worried about jobs is
considerably higher than the concern about jobs expressed by
heterosexual women,'' Bradford said.
   ``Where we found the great differences is in the area of mental
health, in stress-related issues,'' Bradford said.
   ``This does not surprise us, but we can document it. We can see
through our data how health issues that are related to stress are
greater in our population,'' she said.
   The research began with $20,000 in funding, supplemented later
by $8,000 from the National Institute of Mental Health.
   About 1,500 homosexual men and women are at the gathering that
includes a speech scheduled Monday by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.

   Game officials Friday began selecting
applicants for this fall's alligator hunt, the first in more than
25 years as the reptile has battled its way off the
endangered-species list.
   Some 5,800 people applied for roughly 230 permits that are
expected to be issued, said Scott Ball of the Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission.
   Commission officials were sorting through applications Friday
and preparing them for a random, computer selection process. Mike
Jennings, a wildlife biologist for the game commission, said the
final list would be completed early next week.
   Applicants, who must be at least 18, include men and women from
across the state and a few out-of-state residents. Florida
residents will pay $250 for a license, while those from other
states will have to pay $1,000.
   Those who are chosen must complete a six-hour course in
alligator basics and hunting safety before the 30-day hunt begins
Sept. 1. It will be the first authorized season since 1962.
Twenty-eight lakes, rivers and streams have been chosen as hunting
sites.
   Florida's once-endangered gator population now numbers an
estimated 1 million in the wild. Each hunter will be allowed to
kill up to 15 gators, bringing the potential total kill to more
than 3,400.
   Under the rules of the hunt, alligators can be trapped or
harpooned. They can't be shot outright, but hunters will be allowed
to use guns to finish them off if they are still alive after being
speared and dragged to the bank.
   Though there hasn't been an alligator hunting season for a
quarter-century, Florida has licensed hunters to rid the state of
renegade gators that lose their natural fear of humans and threaten
the state's burgeoning population. They kill about 3,500 alligators
a year, selling parts for profit.
   Some of those professional hunters have criticized the plans for
the hunting season, saying that amateurs could get hurt and that
all the meat and hide they bring in could reduce prices.
   ``When you quit having respect for a gator, that's when you get
hurt,'' said one trapper, William Whidden of Osteen. ``I respect
one if he ain't but 2 foot long, because I know what he can do to
my hand.''
   Dennis David, alligator coordinator for the game commission,
dismissed the scare claims of trappers and alligator growers.
   ``There are plenty of the nuisance alligator trappers that have
been doing it for years that are missing fingers or have been
injured,'' said David.

<HEAD>South Korean Leaders Say They'll Consider Proposed Meeting With
North</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's political leaders said
Friday they will consider a North Korean call for parliamentary
talks on easing military and political tensions on the divided
Korean peninsula.
   Leaders of the nation's four main political parties said they
would try to produce a united response by the end of next week.
   National Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo told a National
Assembly committee that the South Korean government would favor
opening the proposed talks as a means of promoting contact with
North Korea.
   Communist North Korea sent an invitation Thursday to the South
Korean National Assembly for talks with the Supreme People's
Assembly in Pyongyang on a non-aggression pact drawn up by the
North.
   In Washington, State Dept. spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley applauded
the idea.
   ``We believe this could be a very positive development and hope
the joint assembly meeting will take place,'' she said.
   South Korean government and opposition leaders said preliminary
negotiations would be needed to work out the terms and details
before any agreement could be reached on parliamentary talks.
   ``The political leaders have agreed to consider affirmatively
the North Korean proposal for parliamentary talks,'' said Lee
Dong-bok, chief secretary to the National Assembly speaker.
   Lee said the governing and opposition leaders reached the
agreement after a briefing by government officials.
   No agreement was reached on the agenda or method of the talks,
he said.
   Kim Dae-jung, president of the Party for Peace and Democracy,
said after the meeting, ``We will make efforts to seek an early
realization of inter-Korea parliamentary talks.''
   The North Korean proposal called for the legislatures of the two
Koreas to hold joint sessions alternately in their capitals to
discuss various tension-easing subjects, including non-aggression
and arms reduction.
   The rival Koreas have presented a series of what they called
``peace proposals'' in recent months, but none of them was accepted
by either side. On several occasions, the two sides even refused to
receive letters from the other side.
   Korea was divided by U.S. and Soviet forces that ended the
Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. Efforts to reunite
the peninsula failed and separate governments were declared in 1948.
   The North invaded South Korea in 1950 to start the three-year
Korean War. About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under
a mutual defense treaty.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clements, hospitalized after
suffering what doctors called a mild stroke, hoped to go home
Saturday, his staff said.
   Clements was in high spirits Friday and awaiting his doctors'
decision on whether he could be discharged, said Reggie Bashaur,
the governor's press secretary.
   Bashur said Clements on Friday discussed economic development
projects and possible appointments with George Bayoud, his chief of
staff.
   Clements talked for five minutes Thursday night with President
Reagan about the Democratic National Convention and the
presidential campaign, Bashur said.
   Seton Medical Center officials reported that Clements' condition
remained good and that medication was keeping his heartbeat regular.
   Dr. David Morris, a heart specialist, and Dr. Jerry Tindel, a
neurologist, said tests indicated that Clements was suffering from
a slight irregularity in his heartbeat, which could have caused a
tiny blood clot to form in his heart before passing through his
bloodstream and into his brain, causing the stroke Monday night.
   The governor, who admitted himself to the hospital Tuesday
evening, suffered some vision problems in his right eye, doctors
said. But they predicted that he could resume his normal schedule
in about a week.

   A year ago, beaches were littered
with carcasses of bottlenose dolphins, killed by a disease
scientist still do not understand.
   This summer, there have been no widespread reports of stranded
dolphins, but scientists are not yet sure whether that is good news.
   ``We're frankly very nervous ...,'' said Robert Schoelkopf of
the Marine Mammal Stranding Center based in Brigantine, N.J. ``This
may simply be a pause.''
   On Wednesday, the center recovered a dead bottlenose dolphin
found on the beach in Long Branch, N.J. Schoelkopf said he ruled
out old age as a cause of death but was not certain if the mammal,
a female about 8 feet long, died from the same malady that killed
bottlenose dolphins last summer. It had been dead about two days,
he said.
   Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said it does appear that deaths among
the bottlenose have subsided, compared with last year.
   ``The bad news is we still don't understand what happened last
year,'' he said.
   According to NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, more than
800 of the mammals washed ashore and died beginning a year ago.
Gorman said that number could mean as many as 5,000 of the animals
were killed, with their bodies being lost at sea.
   By aerial survey, NOAA scientists estimate the East Coast
bottlenose population at 8,000 to 10,000 before last year's
episode. ``But you have to realize that such surveys border on
political polls and black magic as far as accuracy or reality,''
Gorman said.
   ``One thing that has become clear, the effect of the deaths on
the bottlenose population is more profound than we had feared last
year. We now feel that between 20 percent and 50 percent of the
bottlenose population may have died,'' he said.
   Schoelkopf agrees.
   ``We use the beach patrol to take a daily count on the animals.
Right now, our figures on the bottlenose are down by two-thirds,''
he said.
   Those declining numbers may explain why there have been so few
reported strandings of bottlenose, both Gorman and Schoelkopf said.
Because there are fewer animals, the number of beachings is down.
   The bottlenose is the most common of the dolphin species
traveling along the East Coast. The mammals, which can grow up to
15 feet and 440 pounds, are easily trained and often are featured
in aquatic shows.
   Scientists know what killed the dolphins, but they don't
understand why the dolphins suddenly became susceptible to the
microorganism.
   Joseph Geraci, a marine pathologist and veterinarian from the
Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph, headed the research team that
identified the bacteria as Vibrio, a common form that flourishes in
warm water rich in nutrients. The bacteria sometimes is associated
with polluted water and some species cause cholera in humans and
animals.
   ``You would expect the very young and the very old to be
affected more by the disease, but that is not the case,'' Gorman
said.
   ``It makes no sense. Its effect on the reproductive population
could be devastating,'' he said.
   Gorman recalled that the first indications of something being
wrong came at the end of July last year, so the approach of August
makes scientists nervous again this year.
   ``We've seen a number of bottlenose again this year with
barnacles on their dorsal fin. The first and only time we saw that
was last year. I just don't know if that indicates a similar
condition out there _ we'll have to wait and see,'' Schoelkopf said.
   Dr. Ray Birdsong, an ichthyologist and professor at Old Dominion
University in Norfolk, said the deaths of the dolphins is similar
to mass killings of inshore fish from diseases of an unknown source.
   ``Generally, these incidents can be traced to bottom pollutants
that cause lesions on the fish. The bacteria get in those lesions
and take control,'' he said.
   Geraci's studies of the dolphins showed lesions on the body and
in the mouths.

   Call 'em crazy, call 'em goofy, call 'em a
little bit childish _ and convention goers gathering this weekend
just might respond with a pie in your face or a poke in your eyes.
   ``Everybody sees a little bit of one or another of the Stooges
in them _ or they'd like to,'' says Frank Reighter, organizer of
the second annual Three Stooges Convention in suburban Trevose.
   Fans of the Stooges are gathering to buy and sell memorabilia,
reminisce with relatives and associates of the Stooges, and watch
some of the 190 shorts and dozens of feature movies the Stooges
made between 1930 and 1965 _ titles such as ``Dizzy Doctors'' and
``All the World's A Stooge.''
   A pie fight will break out at some time. A ``Shemp-a-thon'' is
also scheduled _ a showing of some obscure films starring ``Shemp''
Howard after he left the Stooges.
   ``In Louisiana, they showed a Shemp-a-thon and a lot of people
showed up thinking it was a shrimp-a-thon,'' said Gary Lassin,
president of the 2,500-member 3 Stooges Fan Club, the
Lansdale-based sponsor of the three-day convention. ``They have a
lot of knuckleheads down there.''
   Reighter said he expects 1,000 to 1,500 people from as far away
as the West Coast and Canada to join in the celebration of the
face-slapping, head-butting, prat-falling brand of slapstick and
high jinks that made the Stooges famous.
   The original Three Stooges, created as foils for vaudeville
comedian Ted Healy in the 1920s, were Morris ``Moe'' Horowitz, who
later changed his name to Howard; his brother Samuel, or ``Shemp'';
and Philadelphia native Larry Fineberg, a.k.a. Fine.
   In the early '30s Shemp left over a pay dispute and Moe's
brother Jerome, or ``Curly,'' joined the group, which split from
Healy and shuffled off on its own to the tune of ``Three Blind
Mice.''
   Curly later became ill and was himself replaced by Shemp, who
was succeeded by two other Stooges _ Joe Besser and Joe DeRita, the
only surviving member of the comedy team.
   Moe was the last original Stooge to die, in 1975.
   Curly will live on this weekend in the likeness of David Knight,
a Palmyra, N.Y., construction worker who moonlights as an
impersonator of the bald-headed, barking buffoon who was so often
the butt of Moe's jokes.
   ``I did a `nyuk, nyuk,' and a couple of `woo woos' and it just
took off from there,'' said Knight, who thinks the Stooges' comedy
has lived on because ``it transcends all generations.''
   The trio's films were once outlawed by some mothers who thought
the Stooges were too violent.
   ``Mom couldn't accept that that wasn't a real hammer Curly was
getting hit with,'' Reighter said, ``but kids could.''

<HEAD>Leaders in Disputed Region Warned About Continued Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 officials fired unjustly in the
troubled region of Nagorno-Karabakh have been reinstated, but those
urging continued strikes may face criminal or disciplinary action,
the Tass news agency reported Friday.
   The reinstatements appeared to be the latest effort by officials
to end crippling strikes in the region and ease an ethnic dispute
that has raged since February.
   However, the nightly television news program Vremya described
the atmosphere in Nagorno-Karabakh as tense. Only two buses were in
service in the region's central city of Stepanakert, the television
report said.
   The region, which is part of the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan,
has been idled by strikes and demonstrations as Armenians, who
comprise more than two-thirds of the area's population, have
pressed their demands for annexation with neighboring Armenia.
   A decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal
parliament, on Monday declared annexation ``impossible,'' but the
labor unrest in Nagorno-Karabakh has continued.
   It was not clear how many Stepanakert residents were on strike,
but the state-run media reports suggested little if any improvement
in the labor situation there.
   Tass quoted a national prosecutor in warning government
ministers and industrial managers who fail to take all measures at
their disposal to end the strikes.
   ``More than 100 people who were earlier dismissed from their
factories for a variety of reasons determined by abnormal and
inter-ethnic relations have been reinstated,'' Tass reported.
   However, a criminal investigation of at least one enterprise
director is under way and others face disciplinary action, the news
agency said.
   The strikes have caused millions of dollars in damage to the
Azerbaijani economy and prevented deliveries of materials to
factories in other regions.
   Soviet media reported food shortages throughout Nagorno-Karabakh
and blamed the shortages on workers' refusal to handle deliveries
to the region. Government statistics released Thursday showed
Azerbaijan was the only Soviet republic that failed to meet its
industrial output quotas for the first half of 1988.
   Residents of Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian republic, had
been staging sympathy strikes and demonstrations prior to the
Presidium decision, but leaders there called off labor actions last
week.
   However, thousands of Armenians have been gathering nightly at
Yerevan's central square to protest the rejection of the annexation
drive.
   Vremya showed film from an interview with security troops in
Yerevan who described the situation there as ``complicated'' but
improving.
   A correspondent for Armenpress, Armenia's official news agency,
reported that only about 7 percent of Yerevan's industrial workers
failed to show up for work on Friday.
   The mostly Christian Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh has
complained during that they suffer discrimination under the
jurisdiction of Azerbaijan, which is predominantly Moslem.
   The leadership of the region of 160,000 residents voted earlier
in July to join Armenia, but that action was vetoed by the
Azerbaijani leadership.
   The Soviet Constitution professes to give citizens the right to
choose their government, but it also gives each of the 15
constituent republics the final say on any proposed border changes.
   The Presidium decision leaned on that constitutional provision
in ruling that Nagorno-Karabakh should remain part of Azerbaijan,
which has governed the region since 1923.
   Armenians began a campaign to annex Nagorno-Karabakh in
February. At least 32 people died in ethnic rioting that broke out
later that month in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.

   Torrential rains destroyed 14,000 houses and
flooded 410,000 acres near one city in northeastern China, the
official Xinhua news agency agency said Saturday.
   It said rains have been falling non-stop for six days on Qiqihar
near Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang province. Xinhua said some
counties near Qiqihar have been getting 3.7 inches of rain a day
and the hardest-hit areas have received more than 5 inches of rain
a day.
   About 2,000 government officials were sent to organize relief
work, the report said.
   In Hong Kong, the Chinese-language newspaper Ta Kung Pao said a
typhoon which swept across southeastern China this week killed 20
people and injured 159.
   China's official media said Thursday that Typhoon Warren had
left 17 dead and 153 injured. It caused destruction estimated at
$270 million.
   Ta Kung Pao said in a report from Canton, capital of the nearby
Guangdong province, that more than 4 million people suffered losses
after the typhoon hit Guangdong Tuesday night with winds up to 80
mph. It said about 150,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, with
more than 13,000 toppled.
   Warren destroyed more than 925,000 acres of crops, 270 bridges,
480 miles of roads and more than 620 miles of telephone lines and
caused about 370 miles of dykes and levees to burst or break, Ta
Kung Pao reported.
   Among the hardest hit areas was the coastal city of Shantou.
Canton, about 190 miles to the southwest, received heavy rain but
was spared the full force of the typhoon.
   The Guangdong provincial Foreign Affairs Office said Friday it
had no information on the damage.

   The secretary-general invited the foreign
ministers of Iran and Iraq to New York next week to discuss a
cease-fire, and Iran indicated Friday it may agree to the direct
peace talks sought by the Iraqis.
   Iraq agreed to accept a technical team Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar directed to visit Tehran and Baghdad to work out
details of a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war, U.N. officials said.
   ``What we have said to the secretary-general is very clear: That
whatever he deems necessary we can go along with,'' Ambassador
Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati of Iran said at a news conference in
answer to repeated questions about negotiating directly Iraq.
   ``Iranian President (Ali) Khamenei said Iran is ready to go
along without any limitations whatsoever on implementation of
Resolution 598 on request, if the secretary-general requires.''
   He did not answer the question directly, but said the
secretary-general had not requested direct talks. Perez de Cuellar
said earlier this week he would prefer such negotiations, but did
not respond to Mahallati's statement.
   The secretary-general invited the foreign ministers, Ali-Akbar
Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of Iraq, to visit U.N. headquarters
early next week for talks with him about implementing Security
Council Resolution 598, which calls for an immediate cease-fire in
the Iran-Iraq war.
   Velayati accepted and will arrive Monday for a one-week stay,
Mahallati said. U.N. officials said Aziz also had accepted.
   Iraq says direct negotiations with Iran are necessary to work
out details of a peace agreement. Iran previously rejected direct
talks.
   The cease-fire technical team of nine military officers and a
civilian is due in Tehran on Sunday.
   Francois Giuliani, the secretary-general's spokesman, said
Friday that Iraq had given approval for the team to visit Baghdad
in the next few days.
   Iran promptly welcomed the team, but Iraq at first withheld its
approval.
   On Wednesday, Iraq gave the secretary-general a five-point plan
calling for direct talks, Iranian guarantees not to attack either
Iraq or neutral shipping, and dredging by the United Nations of the
disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
   The waterway forms the southern border between the two countries
and is Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Also Friday, Iran formally protested to the United Nations about
Baghdad's latest offensive of the nearly 8-year-old war, and
claimed the Iraqis used chemical weapons.
   Mahallati told reporters: ``We are sending letters in protest of
continued Iraqi aggression against Iran in violation of appeals by
the secretary-general ... and also about extensive use of chemical
weapons by Iraq.''
   He said 60 people were killed and 800 wounded in the alleged
Iraqi chemical attack Friday.
   Iraq did not respond to the charge. It has acknowledged previous
use of chemical weapons but claims Iran introduced them to the war.
   The Iraqi advance occurred in a disputed area of the central
frontier region about 125 miles northeast of Baghdad.

   Workers led by Texas troubleshooter
Red Adair put out two of the remaining fires on a North Sea
platform ravaged by the world's worst oil rig disaster, the
platform's operator and main owner said Friday.
   A huge explosion followed by a fierce fire wrecked the Piper
Alpha oil platform 120 miles off Scotland on July 6, killing 167
men.
   The Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. said workers
doused fires in two wells with sea water and capped them with
cement.
   John Brading, chairman of Occidental's British operations, said
that good weather over the past 24 hours had helped Adair's team.
However, he said the platform would remain very dangerous until all
of the wellhead fires had been extinguished.
   One fire was still burning, and another wellhead remained to be
capped.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand EPA's Acid Rain Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday let stand
the Environmental Protection Agency's 1984 denial of petitions from
Maine, New York and Pennsylvania seeking action against acid rain
originating in smokestacks in the Midwest.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia did, however, order that New York's case be
returned to the agency for new data because the standards have been
changed since the cases were filed in 1980 and 1981.
   The three states argued that sulfur dioxide emitted from
coal-burning utility plants and factories in Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and Kentucky made it
impossible for them to meet federal air quality standards, and that
the EPA was required to force those Midwest states to revise their
air pollution control plans.
   But the court said that the proper forum for giving the EPA
guidance on the issue is Congress, not the judiciary.
   Sulfur dioxide is transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric
acid, which concentrates in clouds, falls on its own as fine
particles and is washed out of the atmosphere in solution with
rain. Environmentalists say acid rain threatens lakes and streams
and their aquatic life.
   New York had argued that the western part of the state was
violating standards for smoke, dust and soot. Pennsylvania said
sulfur dioxide from Ohio and West Virginia resulted in violations
in in southwest Pennsylvania of the sulfur dioxide standard. Maine
argued that it could not meet federal visibility requirements at
Acadia National Park because of sulfate haze originating in the
Midwest.
   New York had suggested in its appeal to the court that it would
be willing to gather new data in an effort to show that it could
not comply with the revised EPA regulations. The court accepted
that suggestion.
   However, in Pennsylvania's case, the court noted that the state
did not have hard data on sulfur dioxide violations and that for
one part of the state, Pennsylvania's computer model showed that 80
percent of violation came from sources within the state.
   The court said that Maine's petition was legally deficient in
that it did not allege that its own clean air plan was threatened.
   ``It is well established that when a court is reviewing
predictions within an agency's area of special expertise, at the
frontiers of science, the court must gernerally be at its most
deferential'' to the agency, wrote Judge David Sentelle for
himself, Ruth Bader Bingsburg and Edmund L. Palmieri.
   In the Clean Air Act, ``where Congress wanted EPA to review the
adequacy of existing (plans), it said so. Against that backdrop,
Congress' silence is significant,'' the panel said.
   ``Because the administrator's construction of (the act) is
consistent with the plain language of (the relevant) provision and
is a reasonable one, this court must accept it,'' the court said.
   In a brief separate opinion ``fully concurring,'' Judge Ginsburg
wrote that: ``Congress did not supply such direction in this
instance; instead it allowed and has left unchecked the EPA's
current approach to interstate air pollution. The judiciary,
therefore, is not the proper place in which to urge alteration of
the agency's course.''
   EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the agency was gratified that the
court ruled the ``state petitions were properly denied.''

   Troops blocked Moslem worshipers from reaching
Jerusalem on Friday and riot police reinforcements were sent to the
Holy City in anticipation of a troubled weekend.
   Israeli officials said Jerusalem was becoming the center of a
7{-month-old Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories in
which 231 Palestinians and four Israelis have died.
   They said greater tension was expected this weekend because of
coinciding Arab and Jewish holidays that focus on the sacred and
disputed Temple Mount.
   More than 100 club-wielding riot police stood guard Friday in
the walled Old City, where about 3,500 Moslems gathered for prayer.
   Moslem leaders said 17,000 worshipers had been expected on the
Friday before the four-day Moslem holiday Eid al-Adha. Many were
turned back at Israeli roadblocks, however and curfews kept home
about 270,000 Palestinians.
   Dozens of Orthodox Jews in black coats watched from rooftops
around the Temple Mount as a Moslem prayer leader told his flock
Jews ``think only with their power and their weapons.''
   ``The last day is approaching. ... Victory will come soon!
Listen, you occupiers who are preventing Moslems from the West Bank
and Gaza from praying in the mosques!,'' he shouted through mosque
loudspeakers.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   About 30 police vehicles lined up opposite the sacred Western
Wall, or Wailing Wall _ the last remnant of the Jewish Temple
destroyed by the Romans 2,000 years ago. Sharpshooters took
positions on surrounding roofs.
   District police chief Rachamim Comfort told reporters an Israeli
Arab couple was detained at the Temple Mount entrance when they
tried to bring in a box packed with eight firebombs.
   Comfort said hundreds of extra police were stationed in the
city. At sundown Saturday, Jews start to observe the Tisha B'Av
fast day _ marking the destruction of the temple _ and on Sunday,
Moslems begin celebrating Eid al-Adha _ the story of Abraham's
aborted sacrifice of his son on the Mount.
   Police did not intervene Friday when about 50 Palestinian youths
raised the outlawed Palestinian flag on the Temple Mount and held a
brief march, shouting: ``Kill the Jews!'' and ``Jews, Jews, get out
of Palestine!''
   Worshipers beat up a young Palestinian woman who went onto the
Temple Mount with a tape recorder. She said they mistook her for a
police informer.
   ``There's no doubt that everything that touches upon this open
nerve ending called religion has a high explosive potential,''
Ephraim Sneh, former head of Israel's military administration in
the occupied lands, told Israel radio.
   ``The center (of the conflict) is now in Jerusalem.''
   City Manager Aharon Sarig said recent violence in the city
``proves that Jerusalem is actually the focus of all things.''
   Arab-Americans complained on Friday of being singled out for
harassment by Israeli authorities.
   Philip Wilcox, the U.S. consul general in Jerusalem, diplomat
urged them to stand up for their rights and file complaints with
U.S. consular officials.
   He spoke to about 200 Arab Americans at a gathering called by
the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a Washington-based
lobbying group which plans to open a Jerusalem chapter.
   Israeli officials denied the allegations.
   Participants at the meeting said their money was confiscated at
the border and they were frequently subjected to demeaning searches.
   ``Palestinians are treated like criminals,'' said Hammad Siyam,
49, of West New York, N.J., waving his American passport.
   Siyam was born in the West Bank village of Mukhmas.
   ``How come an American Jew from Brooklyn who has never been here
before has the right to stay in the West Bank forever, and I have
to go back after three months?'' said Ahmad Baker, a West Bank-born
physician now living in Norfolk, Va.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for the prime minister, said Jews were a
special case, allowed to stay in Israel under the 40-year-old Law
of Return.
   San Francisco-born Leila Ahmed Abu Hilal, 24, who married a
Palestinian from east Jerusalem three years ago, said she leaves
Israel once every three months, when her tourist visa expires,
because Israeli officials have not given her a residency permit.

   A federal judge on Friday dismissed
charges against one of four Navajo men on trial in the killing of
two tribal police officers after a desert drinking party last
December.
   The charge against Marques Atene, 22, was thrown out by U.S.
District Judge J. Thomas Greene at the request of the prosecutor,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Stewart Walz, after the prosecution rested
its case.
   Atene had been charged with first-degree murder along with his
half brother, Ben Atene Jr., 24, and two others men, Thomas Cly,
22, and Vinton Bedoni, 31, in the deaths Officers Roy Lee Stanley
and Andy Begay.
   The trial against the others was scheduled to continue Saturday.
They are being tried in federal court because the deaths occurred
on an Indian reservation.
   ``I'm glad to be out of this situation,'' Atene said after the
dismissal. ``I'm happy about it.'' But he said he had no plans to
return to the Navajo Reservation, adding, ``I'm scared right now of
Navajo police. I don't trust them.''
   Prosecutors contend Stanley and Begay were shot at a Dec. 4
bonfire celebration, bundled into the back of a police truck,
driven to a canyon, doused with flammable liquid and set on fire.
The medical eximaner concluded that they were still alive when the
fire was set. The remains were found Dec. 5 in Copper Canyon
southeast of Lake Powell.
   Marques Atene's attorney, Walter Bugden Jr., said Walz asked for
the dismissal because a ``reasonable jury'' could not convict his
client.
   ``That's terrible that the charges were brought against Marques
in the first place, and the government did the right thing by
dismissing the charges,'' he said. Walz said he moved for dismissal
because he couldn't prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. He would
not comment further.
   Testimony in the trial, which began Monday, focused largely on
Atene's co-defendants, and Bugden said the witnesses had testified
only that Atene was at the bonfire and that he was seen picking up
beer cans.
   ``That's not a crime,'' he said.
   Last week, Greene had denied defense motions to dismiss charges
against all four defendants. The defense contends that 13 witnesses
were coerced by FBI agents and tribal investigators who threatened
them with jail and expulsion from the reservation, but Greene
rejected that argument.
   Before the prosecution wound up its testimony Friday, the
brother of one of the slain officers said that Cly threatened his
brother a month before he died.
   Larry Stanley testified that he was with his brother Roy when
the officer arrested Cly for possession of liquor within the Navajo
Reservation, where possession of alcohol is illegal.
   Stanley quoted Cly as saying to the officer: ``Your badge means
nothing. You're going to die later.''
   Under cross-examination by Cly's attorney, Stanley said his
brother had been threatened numerous times by other people he'd
arrested. Stanley also acknowledged that he had told FBI
investigators that the threat was made in August, but later amended
the date to about Nov. 3.

   Ronald Reagan wanted to make Americans believe in
their country again during his eight years as president, and in a
British television documentary, even his critics find it hard to
pin anything bad on what one called the ``good king.''
   Still, history may take a dim view of some legacies of the
Reagan years, such as billions of dollars in national debt, critics
said in the last of a three-part series on Reagan and his
presidency.
   The commercial television series, ``Reagan on Reagan,'' ended
Friday on Channel 4.
   Interviewed for the program, the 77-year-old president talked of
the Iran arms scandal and said he approved weapons sales to the
Iranians because he just ``couldn't sit by'' while U.S. hostages
were held.
   Commenting on what was probably the deepest crisis of his
presidency, Reagan defended the weapons sales, saying he had
believed the Iranians would help gain release of hostages held by
Iranian-linked Islamic groups in Lebanon.
   ``You can't sit by when you know that you've got citizens of
your country who are held in savage captivity by barbarians of that
type,'' he said.
   Reagan also told Channel 4, ``I'd always believed that there was
a kind of a hunger for a spiritual revival ... in our country. Not
only a revival in those things of morality and family and so forth,
but in our nation as a whole, and we set out to do that.
   ``I hear from a great many people who say that they now have a
restored belief in our country.''
   Whether weighing highs like the superpower arms treaty or lows
like the Iran arms scandal, both critics and supporters seemed
confounded by the secret of Reagan's popularity as they spoke of
him for the program.
   Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., majority leader of the House of
Representatives, said Reagan ``will be remembered perhaps as a good
king, but a bad prime minister.''
   ``He is a generous man, and he is a good man,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., ``It's just that some very bad things
happened during his presidency, (and) part of the ominous quality
was that it was difficult to see how ominous those things were.''
   Former Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said, ``You don't know
how he does it, but he does it ... and in the last analysis when
the game is over, they don't ask you how you won the game, but
whether you won the game or not.''
   Historian Garry Wills suggested the ``astonishing protection''
of Reagan stems from his ability to make Americans believe in their
country again, as he promised he would.
   Wills, author of ``Reagan's America,'' said the president's
success is a ``a matter of the emotional investment American people
have made in him. If he is not what we thought he is all along,
then we look like fools.''
   With December's signing of a superpower arms treaty to eliminate
medium-range nuclear missiles, Reagan ``changed the agenda of arms
control from limiting the rate of increase to making very big
reductions,'' said Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Still, critics said the nation suffered under Reagan in some
ways, including in its economy.
   ``The bottom 60 percent of the population have been getting a
smaller share of total income ... and the top 20 percent of the
population are getting an increasing share of total income,'' said
Lester Thurow, dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Sloan School of Management.
   Investment banker Peter Petersen said in speaking of the U.S.
debt, ``I think history will say we've made some of the worst ...
choices in the history of our country.''
   He argued that foreign policy will suffer because ``the attempt
to stand tall while you're on bended knees will be a rather
difficult posture to sustain.''

<HEAD>Say Bermudez To Step Down As Contra Military Commander</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUAN MALTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Enrique Bermudez will step down
as military commander of Nicaraguan rebel forces to defuse the
controversy caused by his appointment to the Contras' directorate,
a fellow leader said Friday.
   Alfredo Cesar, one of the seven Contra directors, also said he
is asking President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica to try to arrange a
new round of peace talks between the U.S.-backed rebels and
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Cesar is the chief Contra negotiator in the talks.
   He told a news conference the new Nicaraguan Resistance
directorate ``will delegate areas of responsibility and, in this
sense, Col. Enrique Bermudez will step down next week from the
general command of the National Liberation Army.
   ``In this manner, Col. Bermudez, who now forms part of the
directorate, will only be the military supervisor of our military
forces, but without any command.''
   Bermudez was a colonel in the National Guard of the rightist,
pro-American Somoza dynasty that ruled Nicaragua for 42 years until
it was overthrown by the Sandinistas in July 1979. He long has been
a source of friction within the Contra coalition known as the
Nicaraguan Resistance.
   The controversy heated up after Bermudez was elected to the
directorate, the political leadership, at a meeting Monday in the
Dominican Republic.
   Seven commanders of the small Contra organization called the
Southern Front, which fights in southern Nicaragua, resigned in
protest.
   Cesar publicly appealed to the seven to withdraw their
resignations, saying they had been badly informed about the changes.
   ``The resignation of these commanders and the threats by other
groups such as the Social Christians and members of the Central
Front to withdraw is precipitous, but we must also recognize they
feel frustrated because they do not receive (American) aid,'' Cesar
said.
   Cesar said the Southern Front received no U.S. humanitarian aid
because the Costa Rican government did not approve its delivery
through Costa Rica.
   The Southern Front has a political base in Costa Rica. The
Northern Front led by Bermudez is based in Honduras, which raised
no objections to deliveries there.
   The U.S. Congress has not approved any military aid to the
Contras since February.
   Cesar said the Contras asked Arias two months ago for permission
to deliver humanitarian aid still in the pipeline through the Costa
Rican Red Cross, but have received no reply.
   The Sandinistas said Bermudez's election was engineered by the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and would make ``the possibility
of negotiating peace even more remote.''
   The Sandinistas and the rebels have been trying to negotiate an
end to their seven-year war since March, prompted in large part by
the regional peace plan that won Arias last year's Nobel Peace
Prize.
   A temporary truce has been in effect, with repeated extensions,
since March 21. No new talks were scheduled after last round ended
in deadlock June 9.

   As shippers and other users probably
suspected, the July drought dried up the Mississippi and Ohio
rivers to all-time lows and severely depressed flow in the
Missouri, the U.S. Geological Survey said Friday.
   The survey's hydrogologists said the Mississippi at Keokuk,
Iowa, averaged 10.5 billion gallons per day for the period July 1
through July 15, 74 percent below normal and 13 percent below the
lowest previous July in 1936.
   At Vicksburg, Miss., the river averaged 93 billion gallons per
day, 66 percent below normal and 22 percent below the 1934 record
for the period.
   At Louisville, Ky., the Ohio averaged 5 billion gallons per day,
84 percent below normal and 3 percent under the smallest previous
July flow recorded in 1930.
   The flow of the Missouri at Hermann, Mo., was 28.4 billion
gallons per day, 42 percent below normal but still 31 percent above
the July low-water record of 1936.
   The St. Lawrence River at Massena, N.Y. was still in the normal
range, averaging 157 billion gallons per day or 11 percent below
the normal mark. That was 21 percent higher than the July 1964
low-water record.

   A water tank ruptured on a hillside
Friday and washed away about nine houses, killing three people and
injuring 17 others, officials said.
   Witnesses said the concrete water tank burst open with an
explosive sound Friday morning.
   The rectangular tank, open on top, ripped apart on the side
facing downhill. Police said it was at full capacity with almost 1
million gallons of water, and a torrent flowed downhill.
   Vicinta Saucedo said she heard a very loud sound and followed
her children outside when they went to see what had happened.
   ``I went out too, and saw a torrent of water flowing past,'' she
said.
   Martin Torrez de la Rosa, 9, said he saw a boy about his age
swept away in the water.
   He pointed to where he saw the boy and said, ``The water took
him away. That's all I saw.''
   Police said the identities of the victims had not been
determined late Friday.
   Ciudad Juarez is a border city of more than half a million
people near El Paso, Texas.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two human rights groups asked
President Corazon Aquino on Friday to renew peace talks with
communist rebels, and lawyers who defend people charged with
rebellion demanded protection from reprisals.
   Friday's appeals were issued by the Philippine Alliance of Human
Rights Advocates and the Ecumenical Movement for Justice and Peace.
They followed a call by Roman Catholic bishops last week for
resumption of talks that collapsed in January 1987.
   Mrs. Aquino did not respond to the appeals. She has expressed
willingness to talk if the rebels make a formal request. The
insurgents say the government will use negotiations to trap top
leaders of the 19-year insurgency.
   Her government and the rebel National Democratic Front
negotiated after a 60-day cease-fire that began in December 1986,
but the government refused to accept rebel demands for inclusion in
the government and fighting resumed in February 1987.
   The National Democratic Front is the umbrella for a dozen
Marxist organizations, including the Communist Party of the
Philippines and its military wing, the New People's Army.
   About 50 civil rights lawyers marched to the presidential palace
Friday to ask Mrs. Aquino to protect them from reprisals for
defending clients charged as communist rebels.
   The march followed a two-day conference during which lawyers
from the United States, Philippines and four other countries
discussed the slayings of at least five Filipino human rights
lawyers in the last eight months and reported harassment of many
others.
   Conference participants released texts of letters from the
American Bar Association to Mrs. Aquino and U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz expressing concern about recent killings of human
rights lawyers here.
   In the letter to Mrs. Aquino, the ABA cited the June 24 murder
of lawyer Alfonso Surigao Jr., who protested the treatment of
leftists detained by the military, and the killing July 2 of
Emmanuel Mendoza, another civil rights attorney.
   Neither case has been solved, but a Philippine Constabulary
colonel was relieved of his duties after being linked to the
Surigao murder.
   The lawyers group met with Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, who
assured them human rights violators will be prosecuted, said Norman
Dorsen of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in New York.
   A resolution adopted at the meeting asked that the government
investigate the killings and take steps to protect lawyers from
harassment by security forces.
   On Thursday, the Free Legal Assistance Group released a report
saying more human rights lawyers have been killed or harassed
during the first two years of Mrs. Aquino's administration than
during the last nine years of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos'
20-year rule.
   It said five lawyers have been killed since Mrs. Aquino came to
power in February 1986 and four were slain from 1977 to 1986.

<HEAD>EPA Agrees to Consider Dioxin Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has agreed
to consider regulations aimed at reducing the hazards of dioxins
emitted from incinerators, paper mills, pesticide wastes and
chemical manufacturing, an environmentalist group said Friday.
   The agreement would settle a lawsuit brought by the group, the
Environmental Defense Fund, said Ellen Silbergeld, toxicologist for
the fund.
   However, the Justice Department still must approve the
settlement before it can be submitted to the judge, said Alicia
Tenuta, EPA's spokeswoman for toxic substances.
   The case had been scheduled to go to trial on Monday.
   The 135 dioxins and dozens of related compounds are considered
highly toxic because one of them is the most powerful cause of
cancer ever tested in laboratory animals. There is some evidence
that dioxins can cause birth defects, but in humans the most
significant known effect is the appearance of chloracne, a form of
acne, among people exposed to high concentrations.
   The dioxins are formed in tiny amounts as a byproduct of almost
all combustion and as unwanted reaction products in certain
chemical reactions. Almost all humans have trace amounts in their
fatty tissues.
   ``It will be the first time EPA has considered dioxin at the
source. All their programs have been cleanup programs,'' Ms.
Silbergeld said.
   The fund sued to force action under the Toxic Substances Control
Act, which allows petitions like the fund's for restrictions on
chemicals that pose an ``unreasonable risk'' to health or the
environment.
   ``We were addressing them anyway,'' Ms. Tenuta said. But under
the settlement, if approved, ``There are various hammers
(deadlines) that come into play'' for making decisions on whether
control measures are needed and when to adopt them.

   Sunday's general election is expected
to produce a governing coalition that will ask Prime Minister Prem
Tinsulanonda to continue in office and pursue the conservative
policies he has followed since 1980.
   Prem's current coalition became riddled with factionalism and he
called elections two years early.
   A total of 3,612 candidates from 16 parties are contesting 357
seats in the House of Representatives and no party is expected to
gain a majority.
   Thai elections generally center on personalities, not issues,
and the main question has been whether Prem should continue as
prime minister.
   Prem has not said if he will accept another term but analysts
consider him the most probable choice. They say the 67-year-old
former army commander, who has no party affiliation, is in the best
position to forge the compromises needed for a governing alliance.
   Most coalition leaders favor keeping him in office and he has
the support of three other elements involved in the decision: the
military, bureaucracy, and King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
   Whoever is selected as prime minister, no change is expected in
Thailand's pro-Western conservative policies.
   Parties in the current coalition are the Democrats, Thai Nation,
Social Action and Citizens.

<TEXT>
   A convicted cocaine trafficker, presented
at a news conference Friday, said, ``When one is with God, one has
nothing to worry about.''
   Roberto Suarez Gomez, considered to be one of South America's
narcotics kingpins, was arrested Wednesday at his ranch near the
city of Trinidad.
   Reporters were allowed to see him where he is being held at the
narcotics control office in a La Paz subburb but they were not
permitted to question him and his comments were limited.
   Suarez Gomez, 57, said he was feeling well and then Information
Minister Herman Antelo stopped him from making further comments and
said Suarez Gomez would be free to talk to the news media after he
is transfered next week to the San Pedron prison in La Paz.
   Suarez Gomez faces a 15-year prison sentence after being
convicted earlier this year of drug trafficking charges in
Trinidad, 320 miles northeast of La Paz. He was tried in absentia
and has not appealed the sentence, according to Interior Minister
Juan Carlos Duran.
   ``The government's top priority is combatting the cocaine trade
which is a threat to our democratic system,'' Duran told the news
conference.
   Ten anti-drug policemen captured Suarez Gomez as he was sleeping
at his ranch 25 miles north of Trinidad. The police confiscated 20
automatic weapons and also arrested two men they said were Suarez
Gomez' bodyguards.
   The United States seeks the extradition of Suarez Gomez. Foreign
Minister Guillermo Bedregal said that could not happen because the
two countries do not have an extradition treaty dealing with drug
trafficking and there is a prison sentence pending against Suarez
Gomez here. Bedregal noted that negotiations are under way between
the United States and Bolivia on an expanded extradition pact.
   Suarez Gomez was indicted in Florida in 1980 on a charge of
conspiring to transfer 854 pounds pounds of cocaine to the United
States.
   Jack Hook, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman in
Miami, claimed Suarez Gomez was involved in dealing in tons of
illegal drug shipments.
   ``He's really the same as the upper levels of the Medellin
cartel,'' said Hook. ``He could be considered one of the pioneers
involved in manufacturing and trafficking cocaine to the United
States.''
   The Medellin cartel, named so because it is centered in the
Colombian city of Medellin, is considered the major cocaine
trafficking organization in Latin America.
   Police intensified the search for Suarez Gomez after he recently
said in an interview on Channel 4 television that ``the American
government is the king of cocaine and the viceroy is the Bolivian
government.''
   He claimed politicians and law enforcement officials received
bribes from drug traffickers. In the ensuing political furor the
government suspended Channel 4's operating license for six months.
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro signed a law Wednesday that
makes most coca growing illegal. Coca leaves, the raw material for
cocaine, are traditiontlly chewed by Bolivian peasants and the law
is expected to include at least 80 percent of the production.
   About 350,000 people in Bolivian's population of 6.2 million
depend on coca leaf farming and cocaine production for their
livelihood, according to Duran.
   It is estimated that the illegal drug trade for Bolivia, South
America's most impoverished country, amounts to about $300 million
per year compared to $500 million for all legal exports.

<TEXT>
   The Sugarcreek Borough Council has
decided that residents were being too free with their speech, and
has decided that constituents should be seen and not heard at
meetings.
   The five council members voted unanimously Wednesday night to
ban public comment during meetings because Council President Tom
Sloss said earlier speaking policies were being abused.
   Borough Solicitor Max Gabreski said twice-monthly council
meetings in this Venango County town of about 5,900 continue to be
open to the public under the state's Open Public Meetings Law.
   ``The right to attend is not the right to participate,'' he said.
   ``Each councilman is available to constituents in their district
by phone or in person,'' the new policy states. Citizens with
questions are invited to contact Borough Administrator Karen Noel
for an answer or to set up an appointment to view public records.
   The council previously had required the public to notify the
borough secretary five days in advance if they wished to speak.
   ``In many situations, people were interrupting,'' Sloss said.
``They were making threats to council ... and for us to try to
conduct business under those circumstances, when people were
constantly at us ... it was just no way to conduct a meeting.''
   ``It does not bar anyone talking to any councilman. It does not
prohibit them from seeing anything they want,'' Ms. Noel said. ``If
residents are not pleased with it, they can not vote for these
particular men at the next election. They have that choice as
well.''

<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Mica has written a letter to
President Fidel Castro expressing ``shock'' and ``astonishment''
over the Cuban government's decision to revoke visas which he and
several aides had been given for travel to Cuba.
   The Florida Democrat had planned to visit Cuba to inspect U.S.
diplomatic facilities as part of his duties as chairman of a House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee.
   But Cuba revoked the visas Tuesday evening shortly before Mica
and his companions were scheduled to fly to the island, citing the
presence of Cuban human rights advocates at a reception given by a
U.S. diplomatic official a week ago.
   In his letter to Castro, dated Thursday and released on Friday,
Mica said, ``I am shocked that you should choose to interfere with
a legitimate congressional visit to conduct internal U.S. business
and review the operations of our mission in your country.''
   A dispatch from Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency quoted a Cuban
Foreign Ministry statement as saying the reception ``was organized
to make it possible for American diplomats to instruct their
counterrevolutionary servants and was not a normal diplomatic
activity''
   The foreign ministry went on to say that the meeting was
interference in the internal affairs of Cuba and ``a gross
provocation that steps completely away from the functions foressen
for the U.S. Special Interests Section in our country, for which it
has enjoyed and enjoys all the facilities offered by our
government.''
   The dispatch was monitored in Mexico City.
   Mica said in his letter that he and his staff have visited a
number of overseas posts, including in the Soviet Union, and never
encountered any hindrance from the host government.
   ``It is ironic that the congressional group you capriciously
kept out of Cuba has traveled freely to the capitals of your allies
behind the Iron Curtain,'' Mica wrote.
   Mica added that Cuba's explanation for revoking the visas was
``astonishing'' because the action occurred just weeks before a
scheduled visit of a delegation from the United Nations Human
Rights Commission to Cuba.
   ``If the mere fact that members of the Cuban Committee on Human
Rights attended a party results in punitive action against the
United States, one can hardly imagine that the Cuban people would
feel free to meet and provide information to representatives of the
U.N. Human Rights Commission,'' he said.
   Mica called on Castro to make it clear to the people of Cuba
that they are free to speak openly to the commission members.
   Otherwise, he said, ``I can only interpret the events of the
past few days as a brazen attempt to intimidate those in your
country who might try to meet with the U.N. group,'' Mica said.
   The State Department also has criticized the Cuban action and
lodged an official protest with Cuban authorities on Thursday.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain Falls On Eastern North Carolina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms dumped heavy rain over parts of the South on
Friday, soaking parched crops and causing some flooding, and rain
also fell on parts of the drought-stricken Midwest.
   Eastern North Carolina got heavy rain from a cluster of nearly
stationary thunderstorms that were part of a large area of slowly
moving showers and thunderstorms that formed ahead of a cold front
along the Atlantic Coast states.
   Wilmington, N.C., got a record 6.49 inches of rain for the date,
well over the former record of 3.88 inches set in 1877.
   The water flooded street drains in downtown Wilmington, stalling
cars and tying up traffic.
   Rain also was heavy over other areas of eastern North Carolina,
where New Bern got 1.60 inches and 1.31 inches fell on Jacksonville.
   But rainfall in North Carolina's southern and central Piedmont
is running about 8 inches below normal for the year, while the
mountains would need 14 inches in a short period to eliminate the
drought, experts said.
   In southern Mississippi, Columbia got 1.5 inches of rain and
half-inch diameter hail.
   Mobile, Ala., got more than an inch of rain within 25 minutes
and Huntsville got over half an inch within one hour.
   In northeastern Florida, more than 2{ inches of rain was
reported within one hour south of Lake City.
   In the Midwest, widely scattered thunderstorms carried briefly
heavy rain over northern Indiana, western Ohio and Lower Michigan,
where some Kalamazoo streets were reported flooded, the National
Weather Service said.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered over
southern Texas, southeastern Louisiana, southern Georgia, eastern
sections of the Atlantic Coast states and sections of Kentucky.
   Widely scattered thunderstorms developed over the mountain and
desert regions of southern California and southern Nevada and
isolated rainshowers were over central Oklahoma.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 109 at Gila Bend, Ariz. The low
Friday morning was 34 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Saturday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
over the Atlantic Coast states, the eastern Gulf Coast region,
Alabama and Florida. Numerous showers were forecast over
southeastern Maine. Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were
forecast over the mountains and desert regions of southern
California.
   High in the 70s were predicted over New England, the northern
and central Appalachians and eastern Ohio; in the 70s and low 80s
over northwestern Washington state and along the California coast;
in the 80s over the Great Lakes states, the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys, the middle Mississippi Valley, the southern Appalachians,
the southern and central Atlantic Coast states except Florida, and
Alabama; between 100 and 110 over the desert Southwest and sections
of the Great Basin; and in the 90s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>Report Cancer Patients Received Radiation Overdoses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EXETER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical physicist's error allowed 153
cancer patients to receive radiation overdoses at the Royal Devon
and Exeter Hospital in southwest England, health officials said
Friday.
   Of those patients who received the 25 percent extra dosages
while undergoing radation therapy between February and July of this
year, 22 have died, according to Exeter health official David King.
   King said, however, that the deaths could not be attributed
directly to the increased radiation. Another doctor said it was
unlikely, but possible, that the overdoses led to deaths.
   King said, ``It was a mathematical miscalculation, and the
medical physicist is mortified.'' He said the error, discovered
eight days ago, has been corrected. The physicist's name was not
released.
   The Exeter Health and Safety Executive has begun an inquiry into
the mistake and another investigation will be conducted by Charles
Joslin, a professor at Leeds University radiotherapy department,
King said.
   Exeter radiotherapist Dr. Chris Rowlands said, ``In the majority
of cases, most people, I think, will be unaffected by this
particular error, but the patients' tolerance to radiation varies.''
   Asked by a reporter if the error could have led to deaths,
Rowlands said, ``I think it is most unlikely but in a limited
number of cases in certain sites that has to be a possibility.''
   He said there was no such thing as a ``normal dosage'' because
amounts of treatment varied greatly.
   Hylton Meire, a consultant radiologist at King's College
Hospital, London, said the 25 percent overdose given to treat a
tumor was ``within the normal range of error.''
   ``When dealing with therapeutic doses of radiation, the
calculation is to minimize the damage to surrounding tissue while
giving tumors a fatal dose,'' he said, and calculations could vary
from one hospital to another by as much as 50 percent.

<HEAD>Four Members of Polygamist Sect Indicted, Accused Of Running Truck
Theft Ring</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least four alleged members of a violent
polygamist sect have been indicted on charges of running a truck
theft ring that shipped stolen pickups to Mexico, authorities said
Friday.
   Named in the indictment were Douglas Barlow, 28; Richard
LeBaron, 18; Tarsa LeBaron, 22; and Cynthia LeBaron, who gave
authorities various birth dates, said Sylvia Lopez, spokeswoman for
the Mariposa County attorney's office.
   ``The defendants are alleged to have conspired in the theft of
1986 and '87 Ford and Chevrolet pickup trucks,'' the spokeswoman
said.
   She said she could not elaborate on the alleged crimes since the
indictment remained sealed Friday ``because there are other
defendants.'' The indictment was handed up Tuesday.
   The four defendants whose names were made public Friday are each
charged with one count of conspiracy to control an illegal
enterprise, one count of controlling an illegal enterprise and 20
counts of felony theft, Ms. Lopez said. They are being held on
$274,000 bond pending arraignments, set for July 29, she said.
   They and a fifth person, Heber LeBaron, 27, were arrested July 1
at a Phoenix motel after police ran a routine check on a truck
parked there and learned that it had been stolen in Texas. Heber
also is being held on bond.
   All five are described as children or followers of late Ervil
LeBaron, founder of the Church of the Lamb of God. The sect has
been linked to 18 deaths and disappearances of former members or
critics over the past 22 years. The elder LeBaron died in a Utah
prison in 1981 while serving time in one of the killings.
   Among the deaths linked to the sect are the execution-style
killings of three former sect members, and the 8-year-old daughter
of one of those victims, in Texas on June 27. But no charges have
been filed against any sect members in those deaths.
   Texas authorities are attempting to extradite Heber LeBaron and
Barlow. LeBaron is wanted on a November 1986 aggravated-robbery
charge in Richardson, Texas, and Barlow is wanted in a vehicle
burglary in Houston.
   Earlier this week, police in Mesa, a Phoenix suburb, said that
the five sect members arrested July 1 may have been involved in a
major theft ring that stole dozens of pickup trucks and
four-wheel-drive vehicles.
   Fifty such vehicles have been stolen in Mesa alone since
January, police said, and there have been similar thefts in Phoenix
and Tempe. It is believed the missing trucks were transported to
Mexico, police said.
   Sgt. Mike Hayes, a Mesa police spokesman, said Wednesday that
officers found a notebook containing lists of locations where
vehicles were stolen, along with a drill and lock-picking tools, in
the Phoenix motel rooms where the five had been staying.

Areas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All 92 Indiana counties were declared
drought disaster areas Friday by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng, Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz announced.
   The designation means qualified Indiana farmers will be able to
receive low-interest Farmer's Home Administration emergency loans.
The loans can be for up to 80 percent of the farmer's loss at an
interest rate of 4{ percent. The loans must be paid back in five to
seven years, Mutz said.
   In spite of rain this week, Purdue University specialists
caution that nearly 90 percent of the state's corn crop remains
rated poor or very poor. ``We're not out of the woods yet,'' said
agronomist Cliff Spies.
   Nevertheless, agriculture experts staffing the university's
drought hotline say the number of calls dropped dramatically, and
the spirits of the callers seemed improved.
   U.S. Rep James Jontz, D-Ind., a member of the House Agriculture
Committee, said earlier Friday that fewer than 10 percent of
Indiana's farmers will benefit from the disaster declaration unless
the government waives a crop insurance requirement attached to the
loans.
   Provisions to waive that rule for a year have been added to the
House version of the measure, Jontz said during a Statehouse news
conference.
   Mutz said the disaster declaration and related loans would be
valuable tools for some farmers. However, he said, ``The real fact
is that ... the thing farmers need more than this is not more loans
but better cash flow,'' Mutz said.

<HEAD>Terrorist Ship Attack Was Clash Between Groups, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attack aboard a Greek cruise ship
July 11 was in fact a clash between Abu Nidal terrorists and the
Israeli secret service set off by anger over an aborted hijacking
of the vessel, a newspaper said.
   The attack aboard the City of Poros killed nine people and
wounded 98.
   The Copenhagen B.T. paper reported in its Saturday edition that
two groups, an Abu Nidal terrorist group and Mossad, Israel's
secret service, opened fire on each other after Mossad stopped the
terrorists from hijacking the ship.
   Quoting Danish intelligence officers and unidentified diplomatic
sources, B.T. said the Abu Nidal group started shooting after
watching a television news report saying a car bomb detonated
outside the Greek port city of Piraeus.
   Greek police said the car bomb went off prematurely six hours
before the ship was due to dock, killing two people in the car.
   The newspaper report said the terrorists reportedly planned to
bring explosives from the car aboard the cruise ship when it
arrived in Piraeus with 471 passengers, to be used in a hijacking.
   Instead, the explosives were detonated by Mossad to avert the
hijacking, the B.T. version ran. Two of those killed in the attack
on the City of Poros are believed to be Abu Nidal terrorists, the
report said.
   It said Danish intelligence is working on the case because
Libyan passport holder Hejab Jaballa, identified by the Greek
government as the likely leader of the terrorist attack, arrived in
Greece on a flight from Copenhagen June 1.
   Jaballa has previously been identified as involved in the
assassination of an Egyptian newspaper editor, for which renegade
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal _ real name Sabry al-Banna _
claimed responsibility.

<HEAD>American Woman Priest Tells Bishops: We Strengthen Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman priest from the U.S.
Episcopalian church told a conference of Anglican bishops Friday
that fund raising had increased during her three years as rector of
All Saints parish in Indianapolis.
   The Rev. Nan Arrington Peete, in an address related to the
divisive issue of women priests in the Anglican communion, said
contributions in her parish had increased by 40 percent over the
past three years.
   She also said her congregation of about 150 fed impoverished
people six days a week and in the winter of 1986 lodged the
homeless in the church because the city's 13 Episcopal churches had
no other shelter.
   ``It was a transforming experience for the congregation,'' Ms.
Peete said.
   But a male opponent of female priests declined even to say
whether or not he recognized Ms. Peete as a minister.
   The ordination of women priests and bishops is the most
difficult issue facing the 525 bishops from 164 countries at the
Lambeth Conference, which is held every 10 years.
   About half the audience, which included the wives of 380
bishops, gave Ms. Peete a standing ovation.
   The bishop of London, Graham Leonard, a leader of the group
opposing women priests, told the conference he did not believe the
ordination of women was ``a legitimate development.''
   ``It is, I believe, a fundamental change for which a much
greater doctrinal consensus is required and from the greater part
of the Christian church,'' he said.
   Answering questions later at a news conference, Leonard said:
``I'm not prepared to say the Rev. Nan Peete is a priest, but I'm
not prepared to say she isn't.''
   Ms. Peete said the invitation to address the gathering came from
the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, leader of the world's
70 million Anglicans. He is presiding over the three-week
conference.
   Opponents of the ordination of women as priests say that issue
has created problems among U.S. Episcopalians, who began ordaining
women in 1977. A statistical handbook puts the U.S. Episcopal
Church membership at 2.5 million, a decline of about 500,000 over
the past decade.
   According to statistics released by the Anglican Consultative
Council, a liaison body of the 27 self-governing churches
worldwide, seven Anglican churches have ordained 1,269 women
priests, 958 of them by the U.S. Episcopalians and others by
churches in Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Kenya, Uganda and
Brazil.
   The 20 other churches have refused to ordain women and
apparently are awaiting guidance from the Lambeth Conference.
   The U.S. Episcopalians are now preparing to consecrate the first
woman bishop and Runcie has said that could break up the Anglican
communion because opposing bishops would not feel in communion with
her.
   Some opponents say that although they might accept women
priests, they cannot accept a woman bishop because bishops are
considered to be the successors of the all-male apostles of Christ.

<HEAD>Bush: Dukakis Was `Very Good,' But What Was That Veep Point?
^EDs: To update SUBS last graf bgng ``The vice president ... ''
with 7 grafs on New Jersey campaign stop.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush praised Michael Dukakis's
acceptance speech as ``very good'' Friday, but said he was puzzled
by the Democratic nominee's pointed insistence that a vice
president shouldn't hesitate to tell the boss when things are awry.
   ``I don't know what that was all about, but I'm sure it wasn't
complimentary,'' Bush deadpanned to reporters.
   In his speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination
in Atlanta Thursday night, Dukakis drew thunderous cheers when he
declared: ``We're going to have a vice president who won't sit
silently by when somebody at the National Security Council comes up
with the cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah
for hostages.
   ``We're going to have a vice president named Lloyd Bentsen who
will walk into the Oval Office and say, ``Mr. President, this is
outrageous and it's got to stop. That's the kind of vice president
we're going to have,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, the certain Republican nominee, suggested that Dukakis
could benefit much from the advice of Bentsen, the senior senator
from Texas.
   ``If he's suggesting that Bentsen can change his views on gun
control, that's good. That would be an effective use for Lloyd
Bentsen,'' Bush said.
   The vice president sought to portray Dukakis as far more liberal
on most issues than Bentsen.
   Ask if he wanted to suggest that the Democratic party was
running against itself, Bush said: ``It'll be running against
itself by the time we get through.''
   The vice president spoke with reporters as he campaigned at a
lakefront Italian festival here.
   Asked his impression of Dukakis' speech, Bush said ``I thought
he gave a very good speech. He did a very good job.''
   Asked why he arrived at that assessment, Bush, balancing a plate
of scrambled eggs and sausage as he moved through the crowd,
quipped ``because he didn't say anything nasty about me.''
   Bush, as he has done in the past, defended his own access to
President Reagan. Democrats have long accused him of being silent
or contradictory about his role in the administration's
controversial decisions, including the aborted arms sale to Iran.
   ``I didn't take it as personal criticism,'' said Bush, ``because
I have a relationship with the president where I can walk in, tell
him anything I think. And then he knows I'm not going to go out and
talk to the press.''
   Bush said he was willing to ``take a shot'' from Democrats on
the arms-for-hostages deal, but said he would talk about the
accomplishments of the administration at the same time _ including
the current record peacetime economic recovery.
   The vice president declined anew to disclose what advise he gave
to President Reagan on the arms deal.
   Later, Bush told a news conference in the rain on the beach at
Point Pleasant, N.J., that he supports a ban on all ocean dumping
``the sooner the better.''
   ``Frankly, it's a national tragedy,'' Bush said, standing
alongside a display of medical wastes that had washed up on New
Jersey beaches.
   New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, who stood alongside the vice
president, called Bush ``a candidate who really cares about the
ocean.'' Kean criticized Dukakis for not also advocating a ban on
ocean dumping.
   A small group of protesters stood on the beach as Bush held his
news conference, holding placards and chanting ``Where was George?''
   Bush, as he had done earlier in the day, praised Dukakis'
acceptance speech, although he said it struck him as superficial.
He said that Democrats had made an impressive show of unity, even
though he claimed it might be short-lived.
   But, Bush said, ``our (convention) will be much more postiive. I
won't be saying what's wrong with the country.''
   ``Jesse Jackson made him (Dukakis) look conservative. He's not,
he's a liberal,'' Bush said.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valentino, the Caesar of Italian couture, exiled the
miniskirt and decreed the return of knee-length or midcalf hemlines
for a fashionable fall and winter.
   His new high fashion collection is young and elegant, with a
myriad of prim little sheaths, small spencer jackets and demure
chiffon gowns. It was presented in Rome's Grand Hotel Thursday
night to a star-studded audience that included actress Sophia Loren.
   The Valentino fall hemline harks back to the classic on the
knee-length, with a few exceptions rising a discreet two inches
above the knee, or dropping to midcalf.
   The tight derriere, characteristic of the 1980s mini, also
disappears, to be replaced by proper pleats even in the longer
skirts.
   While other designers, showing during the Italian high fashion
week which ended in Rome Friday, played heavily on the gilded and
ornate, Valentino insisted on simplicity throughout his collection.
   By day he used such classic fabrics as gray flannel and
houndstooth for his redingote pleated coats and town-and-country
suits with short spencer jackets enriched by a bell-shaped cuff and
long pleated skirt with high waistline, marked by a thin leather
belt.
   He also ennobled the most traditional of winter wear, the
cashmere twin set, by trimming the cuff in sable. For those who
can't afford the couture version, this idea is easily imitated in
the home, with a lesser wool and a humbler fur.
   To rejuvenate his classical elegance, Valentino used bold shades
of pastel pink, blue and green as well as his trademark red. Velvet
shawl collars and cuffs trimmed with lace enhance the youthful
spirit of the collection.
   The cocktail hour by Valentino is basic black with a new twist _
the mixture of fabrics and shades to bring the Manhattan look up to
date. An Empire-waisted black velvet dress, for example, has a
crisscross draped black chiffon bodice, while a simple, sleeveless
black velvet sheath is brightened up by a white, scalloped,
apron-like overslip.
   Nighttime a la Valentino is an ode to the artisan craftsmanship
which is the trademark of Italian high fashion. Embroidery is no
longer flatly stitched on, but comes alive in three-dimensional
sequined roses, or delicate dahlias formed out of satin ribbons.
   Favorite fabrics are chiffon and taffeta, shaped into unfussy
silhouettes, where the emphasis is always on the detail, such as a
draped bodice, flowered embroidery or a richly decorated
cummerbund. Colors are bold shades of yellow, green, purple and
pink.
   Valentino's newest evening shade is Madonna blue, perhaps in
deference to Pope John Paul II, who is celebrating 1988 as a
special year dedicated to the Virgin Mary.
   For the grande soiree, Valentino, the only Italian designer who
can vie with his French colleagues for ballroom fame, proposes
wide-skirted gowns in gray taffeta with an overlayer of tulle
dotted with white tufts for a three-dimensional polka dot effect,
or a sumptuous, brown satin gown whose wide hem trimmed in sable
gives it an Imperial Russian allure.
   As Valentino came down the runway, which was decorated with an
imposing sculpture of the head of a Roman centurion, to take a
final bow, a deeply tanned Miss Loren expressed her approval of the
entire collection, but said she particularly craved ``those
unbelievable ballgowns.''

   A 20-member Soviet team, in Britain to inspect
U.S.-operated missile bases, stopped Friday to examine a local
phenomenon _ the English pub.
   The Soviets were en route to the Greenham Common air base where
U.S. medium-range nuclear missiles have been installed. Both U.S.
and Soviet medium-range missiles are to be eliminated under the
pact agreed to in December by the two superpowers.
   The Soviet delegation made a beer stop at the Coach and Horses
pub in Midgham, Berkshire.
   Pub owner Ann Holden said she had been told to expect foreign
visitors and suspected it might be the Soviets.
   ``All our locals were tickled when they walked in, it caused
quite a stir,'' she said. ``We all felt rather honored that our pub
had been chosen.''
   Mrs. Holden said the Soviets sipped their pints of beer and
talked to other customers through interpreters.
   ``They all had a pint of beer, only one each mind you, and they
all seemed to enjoy it,'' she said.
   The Soviets were given glass coasters and in turn handed out
souvenir badges, but ``I don't know what they said, it was all in
Russian,'' said Mrs. Holden.

   Torrential monsoon rains and
floodwaters swept a crowded bus off a bridge into a shallow ravine
in eastern Pakistan Friday and up to 71 people were killed, police
said.
   They said nine people survived and 18 bodies were recovered,
   The disaster occurred Thursday in eastern Punjab province, about
20 miles southeast of Islamabad. Police said the bus was so
crowded, passengers were riding on the roof.
   The police chief of the nearby village of Kahuta, Riaz Hussain
Shah, said the bus became trapped in floodwaters as it crossed the
bridge and was swept away by the current.
   Witnesses said passengers jumped in panic into the water and
were swept away.
   Shah said the army helped search for survivors, but darkness and
the strong current hampered rescue operations.
   The bus was believed to be ferrying about 80 people between
nearby Rawalpindi and Rawal Kot, about 60 miles east of Islamabad
in Kashmir province.
   The passengers were said to be Kashmiri residents heading home
for an Islamic holy festival.
   Also Friday, Pakistan's news agency reported that a landslide
killed two people near the village of Mansehra, about 50 miles
north of Islamabad.
   An Urdu-language daily, Jang, said before the bus accident that
the rains had killed four people and flooded hundreds of villages.

<HEAD>Court Throws Out Haitian Ex-Ruler's Appeal on Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court Friday rejected an attempt by
former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier and his family to
block a probe into the whereabouts of $120 million the Duvaliers
allegedly stole from the state.
   Lord Justice Sir Christopher Staughton dismissed the Duvaliers'
claim that they were being persecuted, saying in that event, they
should cooperate in the international search for the missing
millions.
   ``This case demands international cooperation between all
nations,'' he said.
   A French court ruled in April that it had jurisdiction in the
case, which is to be heard in Grasse, the French Riviera town where
Duvalier and his wife, Michelle, now live.
   Duvalier was ousted in a coup in February 1986 and fled with his
family to France. Haiti's present rulers accuse the Duvaliers of
misappropriating the funds.
   Haitian government representatives began proceedings to seek
information on assets that may be hidden in Britain, and to have
them frozen if they turn up.
   Judicial sources in France have said a household budget sheet
seized by investigators shows Duvalier and his wife still live
comfortably. The sources said this could undermine their claim that
they left all their money in Haiti.
   Entries include such items as $5,600 for a dress and $83,000
spent on jewelry from July 1987 to January 1988.
   Duvalier, his wife and his mother, the widow of the notorious
dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, have been staying in a
luxurious villa rented from Saudi businessman Adnan Kashoggi.

like to visit South Africa some day but that he will not stop there
during his upcoming tour of five southern African countries.
   John Paul, talking to reporters at the end of a 10-day vacation
in the Dolomite Alpine town of Lorenzago, said that the Roman
Catholic bishops of South Africa do not believe the time is ripe
for such a visit.
   But he added that he hoped ``perhaps one day'' he could visit
there.
   From Sept. 10-20, the pope is scheduled to visit Botswana,
Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.
   From Lorenzago, the pope was scheduled to return to Rome and go
immediately to his summer vacation palace in Castel Gandolfo, south
of the capital.

<HEAD>Journalists and Activists Say They Will Oppose Government Press
Plan</HEAD>

   Journalists, business people
and anti-apartheid activists met Friday, and many said they would
call for international and domestic protests of a government plan
to require registration of journalists.
   The broadly-worded regulations, published June 10, say anyone
carrying out ``news agency'' business must be registered with the
government beginning July 31 or face a 10-year prison term or a
$10,000 fine.
   Lawyers have said the definition of a ``news agency'' is so wide
that major commercial papers that exchange stories, church and
political groups that publish newsletters, and businesses that
issue regular press statements on their operations could be
included if the government so desired.
   South Africa's largest news agency, the South African Press
Association, and all major international news agencies, including
The Associated Press, are specifically exempted from the
regulations.
   But ``stringers'' and ``freelancers,'' local journalists who
supply news to some of the world's major newspapers and news
agencies, are required to register if they work for more than one
employer. Most do.
   Journalists who register under the regulations could later be
struck off the registration list by Home Affairs Minister Stoffel
Botha, who would have the power to prevent such a person from
working again in any journalistic position. His decisions can be
made without a hearing and are not subject to appeal.
   Botha already has the power to expel foreigners working as
journalists in South Africa.
   Friday's meeting at the University of the Witwatersrand
attracted 112 people. There was no formal vote.
   Anton Harber, co-editor of The Weekly Mail, which the government
has threatened with closure, said a wide spectrum of the agencies
or groups that might be affected by a broad interpretation of the
regulations should ``say publicly we will not register, we don't
believe others should register and we would give support to those
who follow this path.''
   The Save the Press Campaign, a group of journalists who
organized the gathering, said they had appealed to Botha for a
meeting but it would not take place until after the registration
becomes effective.
   Editors and publishers of major newspapers were also reported to
be seeking an audience with Botha, and attorneys were preparing a
court challenge for early next week.
   Botha issued a statement Friday saying he did not intend to
target mainstream newspapers, and ``if need be I will effect an
amendment to the regulations.
   ``I merely wanted to ensure that news agencies were kept under
control,'' he said, referring to a half-dozen small, independent
agencies.
   Botha has accused such agencies of endangering the public safety
by reporting unfavorably on police activities, forced removals of
poor blacks and labor disputes in rural areas that are not covered
regularly by South Africa's mainstream press. No criminal charges
have been laid against the small agencies or their reporters, but
some journalists have been detained.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Two men surprised by police during
an attempted bank robbery took a 13-year-old boy hostage and led
police on a 60-mile chase before surrendering early Friday, state
police said.
   No one was injured in the incident.
   Law enforcement officials interrupted the attempted bank robbery
Thursday in the mountain resort town of Teresopolis, 60 miles
northeast of Rio de Janeiro, police said.
   Police said the two suspects fled to a nearby farmhouse and took
the boy, identified as Andre Luiz Santarrita, hostage. Live
television footage showed one of the robbers holding two pistols to
the child's head and pleading with police surrounding the house not
to invade.
   After 10 hours, the boy was released in exchange for five other
hostages, including a police chief and journalists.
   Early Friday, the two fled with the hostages in a car and were
chased by police along the winding mountain road to Rio. The
hostages were released in Rio, and the robbers were trapped by
police and surrendered.
   Rio de Janeiro state police said the two men, identified only as
Mauro and Rogerio, were in police custody in Rio Friday night.

   Tehran radio said hundreds of pilgrims carrying
placards condemning the deaths of 402 people in rioting in Mecca
last year demonstrated in that Saudi Arabian city Friday and that
some of them were attacked by police.
   The radio reported: ``Hundreds of Arab, Turk, Afghan, Pakistani
and American pilgrims demonstrated in Mecca today (Friday),
chanting slogans ... and carrying placards condemning the Al-Saud
regime in their killing of over 400 pilgrims of the holy sanctuary
last year in Mecca.''
   The report by the state-controlled radio, monitored in Britain,
added:
   ``According to received reports, the Saudi regime's police ...
subjected the demonstrators to severe control and surrounded them.
In some sections, they attacked the ranks of the marchers.''
   Parts of the Tehran radio report were indistinct but monitrs
heard no reference to any injuries.
   Saudi security forces were put on full alert earlier this month
as people began pouring in for the annual Moslem pilgrimage to
Mecca, Islam's holy city.
   Saudi authorities have blamed Iran for instigating the riots
there lat year. Iran has blamed violence by Saudi security forces
for the deaths during demonstrations by Iranian pilgrims against
Iran's enemies.
   The Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef Bin Abdel Aziz, told a
news conference last Saturday: ``All precautions have been taken to
face any emergency whatsoever.''
   Speaking in Jiddah, the Saudi capital, Aziz said anyone
undermining security would be ``taught a lesson that will make
others not even think of any similar action.''
   He said Iranians would not be barred from making the pilgrimage
to Mecca this year. ``The door is always open for them,'' he
declared.
   But Saudi authorities announced earlier that the number of
pilgrims would be restricted this year to one for every 1,000
residents of each Moslem country and Aziz said Iran was included in
this restriction.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency charged this month
that the Saudi royal family was not fit to supervise the holy
shrines at Mecca and Medina where the pilgrimage is centered
   Saudi authorities closed entry points to the kingdom on Monday.
This is a traditional measure necessary to organize transport to
the holy sites.
   More than 1 million pilgrims converge on the holy sites most
years.

   A pickup truck driver pleaded innocent
Friday to 27 murder counts _ one for each victim of a crash with a
church bus _ hours after a grand jury rejected charges that could
have led to the death penalty.
   Larry Mahoney, 35, was silent and looked at the floor as defense
attorney William L. Summers entered pleas to the 27 murder charges,
44 counts of wanton endangerment, 13 of assault and one of driving
under the influence of alcohol.
   Carroll Circuit Judge Charles F. Satterwhite set $270,000 cash
bond. The case's chief prosecutor, Paul Richwalsky, contended the
gravity of the crime and the possiblity Mahoney would drink and
drive warranted $1 million bond.
   Summers said he believed bond would be made within days.
   ``It's a high bond, but I believe there's enough support in the
community and his family to raise it,'' he said. Asked if Mahoney
might not be safe out on bail, he said: ``He's a grown man. He's
got a right to decide to put his foot over the threshhold in the
jail cell.''
   Mahoney, who is being held in Oldham County Jail, faces 20 years
to life in prison on each murder count if convicted. Conviction of
capital murder, the charge the grand jury rejected, could have sent
him to the electric chair.
   ``After investigating into the law and evidence, we concluded it
would not be appropriate to make this a death-penalty case,''
Kentucky Attorney General Fred Cowan said after the grand jury
indicted Mahoney. Cowan indicated that authorities did not feel the
crime was premeditated.
   ``This has taken a burden off him,'' Summers said of his client.
``The burden of what happened that night will never be off him.
   ``He couldn't sleep the night before wondering if he would live
or be put to death. He's had that answered.''
   Earlier Friday, Dr. George Nichols, the state's medical
examiner, announced that the 24 children and three adults died of
smoke inhalation after the bus and a truck going on the wrong way
collided May 14 on Interstate 71 near Carrollton. The bus, owned by
Radcliff First Assembly of God, was returning from an outing at an
Ohio amusement park.
   Nichols told a news conference in Louisville that alcohol was
found in the blood of four children but he attributed this to a
natural process and not drinking.
   ``I believe the alcohol showed up because of the post-mortem
fermentation of blood sugar,'' Nichols said.
   The recommendation of capital murder charges had been made by
Carroll County Commonwealth Attorney John Ackman Jr. He suffered a
heart attack shortly after the accident, so the attorney general's
office took over the case.
   Richwalsky said he met with more than 40 families of the victims
Thursday night at the Radcliff police department and explained to
them the less serious charge the state would seek.
   Asked if any of the families were disappointed with the
decision, Richwalsky said: ``I can't say that. We had a frank and
candid discussion. If anyone was disappointed or disagreed, they
didn't verbalize it to me.''

   Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington, in an
emotional appeal to Jesse Jackson supporters, implored blacks and
whites on Thursday to unite behind Michael Dukakis in the same way
that they joined forces to reclaim Birmingham from the bastions of
segregation.
   ``If blacks and whites can work side by side to rebuild and
reclaim our city _ as we have done _ we can rebuild our party and
reclaim the White House,'' Arrington said.
   ``The enemy is not in this hall,'' he said.
   Arrington, who in 1979 became the first black to be elected
mayor of Birmingham, used the theme ````We Are Family'' in his
address to the Democratic delegates. Arrington had originally been
scheduled to introduce New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, but party
officials changed the Thursday night agenda and Arrington's speech
was not an introductory one.
   ``I am _ do not forget _ from Birmingham,'' said the mayor. ``We
know about strife, discord, hurt feelings, shattered dreams, dashed
hopes.
   ``But we also know about healing, rebuilding, putting
differences behind us, about yesterday's enemy being today's ally.
About understanding, forgiveness, unity.''
   Arrington, a Jesse Jackson delegate who has pushed for a
harmonious convention, urged Jackson followers to put aside their
disappointment and work to get a Democrat in the White House.
   ``We need you, Jesse _ this party, this country _ we need your
ideas, your convictions, your empathy, your passion, your vision,
and that great gift from God: your powerful words ...
   ``We need your strong arms to lock with ours, marching into
battle, not against our own, but against the party of privilege.''
   In his prepared remarks, Arrington likened the role of Jackson
and his supporters in the fall campaign to Bradley's performance on
the basketball court.
   ``As a pro player, he was a winner, best known for moving
without the ball, helping to position his team for the win,'' he
said of the man he called ``my taller brother.''
   ``Likewise, in politics he knows that you don't always have to
have the ball to help your team win, that sometimes you have to
move without the ball or to pass to a teammate. He knows that
teamwork is what wins.''

   Rose Kennedy turned 98 Friday, and her family
joined in a celebration at their cluster of houses at Hyannis Port.
   Her only living son, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., flew to Cape
Cod for the occasion as soon as the Democratic National Convention
in Atlanta concluded. Also attending a dinner Friday night were her
daughter, Eunice, and son-in-law Sargent Shriver; daughters
Patricia Lawford and Jean Smith; daughter-in-law Ethel Kennedy, and
an assortment of grandchildren.
   White cake with chocolate frosting, which Mrs. Smith said is her
mother's favorite, was served for dessert.
   Kara Kennedy, the senator's daughter, brought 98 long-stemmed
red roses from the Rose Kennedy Garden in Boston's North End, where
Mrs. Kennedy was born.
   Earlier Friday, the family attended a Mass.
   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg last month named her newborn
daughter Rose Kennedy Schlossberg, but the Schlossbergs were not
expected to go to Cape Cod this weekend, Mrs. Smith said.
   Mrs. Kennedy has been bedridden since suffering a stroke in 1984.

   Hungarian leader Karoly Grosz said Friday he
hopes improved East-West relations fostered by President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will improve trade opportunities
between Hungary and the West.
   Grosz, newly elected general secretary of Hungary's Communist
Party, was welcomed to Los Angeles by Dr. Armand Hammer, chairman
and chief executive officer of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and a
longtime associate of Soviet and other Eastern European political
leaders.
   Hammer offered an official welcome to the city on behalf of
Mayor Tom Bradley who is in China on a trade mission.
   Grosz, 57, who replaced longtime Hungarian leader Janos Kadar in
May, is in the middle of a visit to the United States that will
include a meeting with Reagan on July 27.
   In addition to being general secretary, the top political post
in Hungary, Grosz also serves as prime minister.
   At a news conference at Occidental's headquarters where he was
flanked by Hammer and an interpreter, Grosz described his visit to
the United States as an effort to improve prospects of economic
cooperation between his country and America.
   ``I think the mere fact that we are here speaking in this room
right now is evidence'' of the potential for increased cooperation,
said Grosz through an interpreter. ``This is the result of the
constructive policies of President Reagan that the prime minister
of Hungary could lead a delegation to the U.S.''
   Asked what success he had achieved in increasing U.S.-Hungarian
trade, Grosz answered, ``Successes we have not, but hopes I do
have.''
   In general terms, Grosz said he had discussed business
opportunities with Hammer.
   ``We have had very constructive discussions with Dr. Hammer,''
said Grosz. ``But what we have discussed is still not reality, but
very hopeful (for) the future.''
   Hammer said some steps have been taken that could lead to mutual
economic ventures.
   ``We have had many good talks _ the prime minister and I,'' said
Hammer. ``Recently we signed letters of intent in Russia for a
joint venture, and Hungary has been working on this project, too,
for four years approximately,'' he said. ``And I think it very
likely that we and our partners will consider ... the possibility
of inviting Hungary to participate with us.''
   Throughout the news conference the Hungarian leader sat erect
with his hands in his lap. He continually fingered a small jade
disk.
   Grosz explained why he always keeps the small charm with him.
``It is for luck,'' he said. ``Politicians always are in need of
luck.''

   A tired but triumphant man arrived in
town Friday after walking 1,500 miles for the past three months in
a successful effort to dramatize his desire to sing on the Grand
Ole Opry.
   David Stewart, 37, of Gillette, Wyo., said the general manager
of the 63-year-old Opry susprised him with a phone call Friday
evening saying he could sing on the live country music show
Saturday night. An Opry spokesman confirmed the invitation.
   ``I was sitting there in my motel room when Mr. (Hal) Durham
called me and asked me about the walk and so forth,'' Stewart said.
When Durham offered him a spot on the show, Stewart said, ``I just
about fell out of my chair.''
   Opry officials said before Stewart began his trip that Opry
singers normally are veteran performers or nationally known
recording artists. They suggested he audition for The Nashville
Network show, ``You Can Be a Star,'' which sponsors competition for
budding country music performers.
   Stewart reached the steps of the state Capitol on Friday to
climax a trek that covered seven states and wore out three pair of
athletic shoes.
   ``I feel great,'' he said. ``I'm very emotional now. But it was
a beautiful trip and I met some beautiful people.''
   Snicker, a brown and white 2{-year-old mixed cocker spaniel,
made the trip with him. ``People brought him dog bones and
things,'' said Stewart, on leave from his job as manager of a
fast-food restaurant.
   Stewart left Gillette on April 30 and walked across Wyoming,
Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee. Weather
ranged from a May 1 snowstorm in Wyoming to high heat the past few
weeks.
   ``There were days when it was 105 or 106 degrees,'' he said. ``I
just kept thinking about getting to Nashville.''
   Stewart normally walked six days a week, taking Sundays off, and
averaged up to 30 miles each day. He stayed in hotels or in a motor
home that followed him with country music promoter Floyd Haynes
driving.
   ``This was a way for me to show my appreciation of country
music,'' Stewart said of the walk.

   Weary firefighters hoped for rain Friday to give them a hand on
52 forest fires burning in northern Alaska, and a Wyoming blaze
that had charred nearly 20,000 acres was within a mile of the
border of Yellowstone National Park.
   Arson was blamed for six fires in the mountains northeast of Los
Angeles and for a pair of fires that had burned nearly 11,000 acres
and six homes east of San Francisco. Gusty wind fanned an
out-of-control blaze in Washington, and wind in Colorado pushed a
fire in all directions.
   Fires also burned in Oregon, but in Utah, firefighters contained
a blaze that blackened 300 acres in a desolate scrubland area
northwest of Cedar City.
   None of the Alaska fires was much of a threat to life or
property, said Bill Rockwell of the Bureau of Land Management's
Alaska Fire Service office in Fairbanks.
   ``We've had several cabins threatened, but we've managed to put
a line around those,'' Rockwell said Friday. ``Seventeen fires have
manpower on them; the others are in limited suppression areas and
they're being monitored by air.
   ``We're getting rain in Fairbanks and some rain in and around
the fires. What we need is a good front to move in, but it doesn't
seem to be happening.''
   A half-dozen of the Alaska fires had charred large areas, but
mostly in remote terrain covered by trees of little commercial
value, officials said.
   The Waring Mountain fire had burned 138,000 acres about 35 miles
northwest of Ambler, Rockwell said. The Livengood fire had charred
300,000 acres, but was reported moving toward the sparsely
populated Yukon Flats refuge.
   Fire managers say it has been unusually dry in Alaska this year.
Lightning has caused most of the fires.
   The Mink Creek blaze in the Teton Wilderness in Wyoming grew by
almost 2,900 acres since Thursday to cover 19,960 acres Friday,
with most of that growth on the fire's northern end near
Yellowstone, said Pam Gardner, a fire information officer for the
Bridger-Teton National Forest.
   Although the fire was nearing the park's border, it was still
far away from any major attractions. Several fires were burning
within the park, but firefighters would go to work on them only if
they threatened structures or adjacent national forest lands, said
park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   Also in Wyoming, a 600-acre blaze in the Bridger Wilderness area
about 25 miles north of Pinedale was about 75 percent contained
Friday, said fire information officer Dave Olson.
   Wind blowing at 15 to 20 mph with gusts to 30 mph hampered some
300 firefighters battling an out-of-control fire that covered 120
acres of felled timber and logging debris near Washington's
Snoqualmie Pass. The wind diminished during the afternoon and
firefighters tried to stop the fire at the top of a ridge,
officials said.
   Department of Natural Resources spokesman Tim Boyd predicted it
would take several days to control the fire, which was burning or
threatening 1.5 million board feet of Douglas fir worth more than
$300,000.
   The fire, mostly on rugged private land, had destroyed a
bulldozer and logging tower.
   ``There's no precipitation in sight. This really has a lot of
potential to be a very tough fire,'' Boyd said.
   In northeastern Washington, a grass-and-timber fire had burned
about 1,500 acres on the Colville Indian Reservation, covering the
town of Omak with smoke, but it had been circled by a bulldozer
trail, said Pat Quill of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. A few
abandoned buildings were destroyed.
   A fire about eight miles north of Canon City, Colo., was
``moving in all four directions'' in brush and pinon juniper Friday
because of erratic wind and more than tripled in size to 1,100
acres by late afternoon, BLM fire officials said.
   ``Once the winds and weather turned on us, we didn't have a
chance,'' said associate fire manager Stuart Freer.
   Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters were conducting final
mopping-up operations at a 3,130-acre fire near Dinosaur National
Monument and a 15,000-acre blaze near Maybell that was one of the
largest range fires in the state's history.
   An arsonist set six fires in the San Bernardino National Forest
about 50 miles northeast of Los Angeles, including one that
destroyed two storage buildings and a car, blackened 150 acres and
threatened about 10 homes, authorities said Friday.
   The fires that began Thursday were all contained by 6 a.m.
Friday, said Lindsay Maierhofer, spokeswoman for the Forest Service.
   But another fire, which authorities believe was started by
fireworks, had covered 400 acres and was burning out of control
Friday afternoon in the Spoor Canyon area of the national forest.
That fire briefly threatened several homes before the wind changed
direction.
   Another out-of-control brush fire burned over 140 acres near
Morgan Hill, Calif., southeast of San Jose.
   Hundreds of state prisoners battled two arson-linked fires that
had charred 11,000 acres of heavy timber and brush near the
Calaveras County town of Rail Road Flat, 150 miles east of San
Francisco. Firefighters were close to containing the blazes, which
have caused an estimated $3.8 million damage to the drought-parched
region since Tuesday.

<HEAD>Bradley Says President Must `Stay Awake'</HEAD>

   Sen. Bill Bradley told the Democratic National
Convention on Thursday the next president ``must be a person who is
awake and will stay awake,'' and that Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis is ``committed to excellence.''
   ``A president must engender trust because a president leads by
trust,'' the New Jersey senator told the convention's closing
session. ``Trust is a bond earned by honest words and honest
activities.''
   Bradley, considered by many a candidate for the national ticket
but who declined to run, paid homage to past leaders, lavished
praise on Dukakis, saying he is excited to lead, committed to
govern all the people and proud of the country.
   Dukakis is ``a person committed to excellence, who is calm under
pressure and has the capacity to know what's important,'' Bradley
said.
   Bradley aimed some barbs at the Reagan administration without
naming it, saying the next president ``must be a person who is
awake and will stay awake, because he can't rest while kids kill
kids in our cities and families sleep on the streets.''
   ``A good president doesn't define honesty as simply staying out
of jail,'' he said.
   ``Does it make a difference who's president of the United
States?'' Bradley asked. ``Did Lincoln make a difference? Did
Woodrow Wilson? Ask any child who stares in wonder at the Grand
Canyon if Teddy Roosevelt made a difference.''
   He said a president can offer inspirational leadership by
showing how the past is part of the present, and how both can lead
to a better future.
   ``He can give reassurance and understanding to those who have
never been reassured or understood; he can give guidance in a world
that technology changes every day. The words of a president, like
nature's returning seasons, can provide continuity in the midst of
change.''
   Courage, honor and truth are vital qualities of leadership and
the president must demonstrate self-sacrifice to encourage
unselfishness among others, Bradley said.
   ``He knows ... that the ultimate question posed to a citizen in
a democracy is to ask yourself what you owe another human being,''
said Bradley. ``Do you owe more than a contribution to charity or
taxes to the government? Do you owe a commitment of some part of
your life? Or do you believe you owe nothing at all?
   ``How we answer these questions will determine the kind of
society we become,'' he said.
   Asked before the speech if he were anxious, Bradley, a former
professional basketball player, responded that being nervous ``has
a tendency to get the adrenalin going.''

   The wall of a concrete water tank
ruptured Friday, killing four people and injuring 19 others when a
torrent gushed through a neighborhood of adobe houses, destroying
nine homes.
   Residents said they had recently warned city officials about
cracks in the 3-year-old tank, which was perched on a hillside.
   More than 750,000 gallons of water poured down the hillside,
officials said, and the tank's east wall, about 120 feet long,
separated cleanly from the rest of the tank.
   A 90-foot section of the 9-inch-thick, reinforced concrete wall
was thrown 20 feet across a dirt road and came to rest against a
house. The rest of the wall broke away and blocked the road.
   Manuel Ortega, director of the city Water and Sanitation
Department, said the tank was built in 1985, though neighborhood
residents said the tank was six months old. Ortega said crews
worked on the tank about six months ago.
   The tank was about 120 feet wide, 60 feet deep and 12 feet high.
Ortega said it was at full capacity, or 780,000 gallons.
   ``We heard a very loud sound, like an explosion,'' said Vicenta
Saucedo, 33. ``But I didn't pay attention because I was feeding my
children breakfast. And then the girls went out to see what
happened, and I went out too, and I saw a torrent of water flowing
past.''
   The gray tank was perched near the top of a foothill to the
western mountains bounding this border city near El Paso, Texas.
Below the tank was a cluster of houses made of adobe, cinderblock
and concrete. The rush of water flattened houses in its path and
then drained into a gully about 100 yards downhill from the tank.
   The displaced families spent the day digging through mud and
rubble to retrieve their belongings. Some placed clothes on
automobiles to dry in the desert sun. Others cleared spots where
they placed dishes, religious statuettes and paintings, alarm
clocks and other items.
   Perfecto Guerrero de la Cruz said he was at work when he was
notified of the accident. He rushed home and found that his nephew,
Francisco Olvera Guerrero, 17, had died.
   Jorge Martinez, 3, and Jose Antonio Martinez Lin, 9, also were
killed, and a man injured in the accident died Friday afternoon in
a hospital, Fire Chief Gabriel Rodriguez said. He said the man's
name was not being released pending notification of relatives.
   One person was in critical condition at Juarez General Hospital,
a police spokeswoman said. Twelve others were hospitalized with
minor injuries and six people were treated and released.
   During a break from digging through his house's rubble with a
pick ax, Perfecto Guerrero said he and neighbors had notified city
officials a few weeks ago about cracks they had seen in the tank's
walls.
   ``We called them (city officials) before to tell them there was
some cracks, but as always they never listen until they see (the
damage),'' he said.
   The structure was filled earlier this year, giving residents of
the Lopez Mateos and Diaz Ordaz subdivision running water for the
first time.
   ``So we finally got water, but then we got too much _ and lost a
life,'' Guerrero said as he gazed at the destruction around him.
   Nine-year-old Martin Torrez de la Rosa said he was grinding corn
at the bottom of the hill when he heard the sound and looked up.
   ``When I was running away, I saw a boy over there,'' he said,
pointing to a spot farther downhill. ``The water took him away.''
   City engineer Luis Soria told the El Paso Herald-Post that
investigators were looking into the possibility that the tank's
foundation might have been weakened in the wet ground. Three inches
of rain have fallen since July 1, as measured at El Paso
International Airport, compared with 1.6 inches in a normal July _
the area's rainiest month on average.
   Juarez, a city of 1.1 million with an annual growth rate of
almost 10 percent, uses different types of water tanks, from ones
like the concrete box that ruptured Friday to the steel,
cylindrical tanks on stilts that are common in the United States.
   Witnesses said the ruptured tank was erected in just a few days
about six months ago.
   Irene Vallez, who lives near the scene of the accident, said
water overflowed last week from pipes atop the covered tank. Like
Guerrero, she said cracks had formed in the walls a few weeks ago.
   ``About 9:05, water started coming out and flowing in a trickle
down the street,'' she said. ``Then, about 15 minutes later, I
heard a sound like an explosion.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has acknowledged that its
initial report on a 1986 radioactive spill at an Ohio military base
was incomplete, but is protesting a proposed fine as unwarranted,
according to documents released Thursday.
   The documents, made public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
were prepared by the Air Force in response to a proposed fine of
$102,500 by the NRC in connection with the incident at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton.
   The NRC said the proposed fine is for willful failure to report
the spill within 24 hours and for the internal exposure of an
individual to the radioactive powder.
   However, in its response to the NRC the Air Force argued that
under the facts of the incident, the requirements do not clearly
mandate a report within 24 hours.
   ``Through a chain of errors, but without any intent to withold
information or deceive, the subsequent report from the (Air Force)
was neither full nor complete,'' Gary Vest, deputy assistant
secretary of the Air Force, told the NRC. ``In addition, the
reporting regulation itself is ambiguous...''
   The Air Force said that ``miscommunication'' within the staff of
the Air Force's Radioisotope Committee in relaying information from
Wright-Patterson resulted in the NRC not being initially provided
with full information on the spill.
   No one was injured in the spill of americium-241, but a
radiological safety officer at the base said tests showed he
inhaled a small quantity of the powder.
   The NRC said the spill occurred on Sept. 18, 1986, and was not
reported to the NRC until Sept. 26, at which time it was described
as leakage from low-level radioactive waste drums and not as a
significant spill of americium.
   The Air Force did not formally notify the NRC of the americium
spill until Nov. 7, 1986, the NRC said.
   Prosecutors in Ohio have been investigating an alleged attempt
to cover up the spill, and a former radiation safety officer at the
base was indicted by a grand jury last May for his role in the
incident.

<HEAD>Dukakis' Nomination Vote Sends Viewers Away</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Without the lure of Jesse Jackson's oratory,
television audiences dropped off again for the third night of the
Democratic National Convention, according to figures from the A.C.
Nielsen Co.
   ABC won Wednesday night with a rating of 8.7 and a 16 share. NBC
and CBS each had a rating of 6.7 and a 12 share. The main event of
the night was the nomination of Michael Dukakis as the Democratic
presidential candidate.
   The rating is taken from the nation's 14 largest television
markets. Because of a technical problem, Nielsen said it would not
have the national ratings until Friday. CNN's rating was also
delayed.
   A rating is a percentage of total homes with televisions in the
markets surveyed. A share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The ratings had gotten off to a weak start on Monday, then rose
Tuesday when Jackson gave his speech to the delegates.
   The 1984 Democratic convention got an 8.4 rating on CBS, 7.7 on
ABC and 7.1 on NBC. CNN had a 1.5.
   Network ratings for convention coverage have been declining
since 1976. The highest-rated Democratic convention since the
events have been televised was the tumultuous 1968 convention in
Chicago. It had a rating of 16.1 on NBC, 14.1 on CBS and 8.5 on ABC.

   The U.S. cruise missile counting done, Soviet
inspectors turned tourists Thursday, sightseeing in London and
joining royalty, school groups and thousands of families at a
military pageant, the Royal Tournament.
   The 20 inspectors, some after a sleepless night spent checking
two missile sites and writing reports, watched the display in the
packed Earls Court Exhibition Center in west London.
   Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Princess Anne, seated 20 rows
above the Soviets in the royal box, did not notice the plainclothes
group arrive.
   But she glanced down, frowning slightly, as they slipped out,
escorted by five American officers, just before the national
anthem, ``God Save The Queen,'' was struck up at the end of the
three-hour afternoon performance.
   Meanwhile, 10 U.S. inspectors meanwhile arrived in
Czechoslovakia Thursday for the first inspection of a former base
for Soviet nuclear missiles in the Warsaw Pact country, the
official CTK news agency reported in Prague.
   CTK said earlier that permission was granted for the inspection
at the central Czechoslovak town of Hranice, 180 miles southeast of
Prague.
   Soviet troops stationed with the SS-12 missiles began pulling
the weapons out in February, even before the U.S. Congress ratified
the superpower treaty. The former missile base at Hranice now
houses a Czechoslovak army unit, CTK said.
   Thursday's show in the 13,000-capacity Earls Court Exhibition
Center was a near-sellout.
   Organizers said they gave the Soviets the best seats left, at
$21.25 each, paid for by the American hosts.
   The inspectors watched massed bands of British regiments
perform, equestrian events and hundreds of children in a gymnastic
display to pop music.
   Toting packed suppers, the Soviet inspectors _ 19 men and one
woman _ and the six-man crew of their Iluyshin IL-62 jet then
visited the Houses of Parliament, a tourist must-see, and took in
other sights from their bus.
   Their schedule called for them to return late Thursday to the
U.S. air base at Greenham Common, the main cruise missile site in
Britain, 50 miles west of London, and to fly home on Friday,
British officials said.
   The group arrived Tuesday on the first inspection in Britain
under the U.S.-Soviet treaty that provides for elimination of the
superpowers' land-based medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe by
1991.
   Under the treaty, inspectors are not allowed off missile sites.
But British and U.S. officers waived the rules when the Soviet
group asked to see some famed London landmarks.
   The inspections at Greenham Common and the other U.S. cruise
base in Britain, Molesworth, near Cambridge, are part of a 60-day
period of initial checks which started July 1.
   The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the United States and five
Western European countries. U.S. experts are visiting 133 East bloc
sites. No violations have been reported so far.

   Animal torture and slayings attributed to
devil worshipers and the Afro-Cuban Santeria religion appear to be
increasing, and authorities are researching the tricky legal
question of how to stop it.
   The City Board of Animal Regulation, which has relied largely on
anecdotal accounts of increased ceremonial mutilation of animals,
has asked for a report on the matter, outgoing board member Arthur
Margolis said Thursday.
   ``All I am aware of as an activist is that there have been
animal sacrifices by satanist groups and other groups,'' said
Margolis. He said the study should supply documentation of the
problem.
   In suburban Hawthorne, authorities raided a home last week and
seized 22 chickens, two goats, a piglet and a lamb. The officers
also found four goatskins, several chicken carcasses, and evidence
of backyard animal slaughter. The owner denied Santeria practices.
   Reed said authorities last fall found six goats bound and kept
in the bathroom of a Culver City home, along with several chickens.
Candles and other religious items suggested Santeria, and the
owners were charged with animal cruelty.
   Margolis, an attorney, hopes the report will lead to
consideration of a law banning animal deaths and tortures as part
of a religious ceremony. He admitted a First Amendment fight would
immediately follow, as it already has in one city.
   Officials in Hialeah, Fla., a mostly Hispanic city near Miami,
passed three laws in 1987 aimed at the Santeria Church of Lukumi
Babalu Aye, the first public church of the sect opened in Florida.
Los Angeles has no such established church.
   The Hialeah laws prohibit sacrifice of animals, including goats,
pigs, cows, poultry, cats or dogs, animals which sect members
slaughter during so called ``red magic'' rituals that seek favors
or advice from their gods.
   The church sued the city in federal court alleging the laws
violated their constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion.
The suit is pending.
   Charlene Drennon, West Coast director of the Humane Society of
the United States, said she believes a model law drawn up by her
group would meet constitutional tests.
   ``There have been several cases where the Supreme Court has
decided how far religious freedom can go,'' she said Thursday in an
interview from her Sacramento office. She cited a Supreme Court
ruling that said smoking marijuana could not be regarded as a
religious practice.
   Ms. Drennon said, however, that education was a better approach
than law enforcement when dealing with a clash between religious
practices and animal welfare.
   ``I think it needs a very heavy duty emphasis on educating
people,'' she said.
   Santeria is a mix of Roman Catholicism, voodoo, and African
rituals attributed to the Yoruba tribe of Nigeria. Some Roman
Catholic saints borrowed by Santeria have come to represent African
gods.
   The followers are secretive about their practice, and in most
places do not have special places of worship. Efforts were
unsuccessful to contact Santeria followers or priests, called
santeros, in Los Angeles or Hialeah.
   The establishment of the religion in Los Angeles is largely
manifested by the profusion of ``botanicas,'' stores which sell
supplies, statues and pictures used in Santeria and other rituals.
   Sociologists believe there may be as many as 50,000 practioners
of Santeria in the Los Angeles Cuban immigrant community.
   Anthropologists estimate that related, similarly derived
religions have 100 million followers in Latin America and the
United States.
   Reed said authorities last fall found six goats bound and kept
in the bathroom of a Culver City home, along with several chickens.
Candles and other religious items suggested Santeria, and the
owners were charged with animal cruelty.

   Graceland lives!
   Elvis Presley's only child has cleared the way for her father's
former residence, Graceland, to remain a tourist attraction at
least 10 more years, lawyers said Thursday.
   ``She's not going to close it down. It's doing fabulously,''
said Blanchard Tual, a lawyer who was appointed to protect Lisa
Marie Presley's legal interests when she was a minor.
   Miss Presley, 20, would have taken sole control of his estate
when she turned 25, according to her father's will. But she agreed
to extend by five years the management structure of a trust set up
to handle her father's estate.
   The management agreement, approved Wednesday in Chancery Court
in Memphis, extends the conditions of the trust until 1998, said
Barry Ward, a lawyer for the Presley estate.
   ``Basically, this is a vote of confidence from Lisa Marie to the
management team to continue to handle the assets that she will
inherit from her father,'' Ward said.
   Tual said Graceland managers have encountered problems because
of speculation over Miss Presley's plans for Graceland.
   ``They found it harder and harder to deal with people on a
long-term basis when they said, `Look you've only got five years
left and how do we know what Lisa Marie will do in five years when
the trust terminates.' In order to do away with that uncertainty,
they just extended it five more years,'' Tual said.
   Tual no longer represents Miss Presley but was called in to
review the request for the management agreement.
   Presley was largely uninterested in business matters during his
career and he was worth $5 million to $7 million when he died,
estate officials say.
   Joseph Hanks, an accountant and trustee of the Presley estate,
said it is worth about $50 million now and its value is increasing.
   The estate, which has worked in recent years to secure legal
rights to the singer's name and image, includes Graceland, a
white-columned, three-story house that attracted more than 600,000
visitors last year.
   The Graceland complex, with a 36,000-square-foot shopping center
devoted almost entirely to Elvis souvenirs, generates some $9
million a year in tourist business.

<HEAD>Colombian Government to Attend Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator said Thursday that a
government representative will join national peace talks next week
with leftist rebels, but leaders did not say whether there would be
face-to-face meetings.
   The announcement by federal Senator Edmund Lopez, a member of
President Virgilio Barco's Liberal Party, came a day after leftist
guerrillas released a former presidential candidate who was
kidnapped May 29.
   After his release, newspaper editor Alvaro Gomez Hurtado on
Thursday called for the government to hold peace talks with the
leftist rebels, a controversial view in this country ripped by
periodic guerrilla attacks and one he previously did not seem to
share.
   The April 19 Movement, also known as M-19, freed Gomez Hurtado
Wednesday night. M-19 is the most notorious of Colombia's five
leftist guerrilla groups.
   Gomez Hurtado, the Conservative Party candidate who lost the
1986 presidential election, was kidnapped in a hail of submachine
gun fire in Bogota.
   In his presidential campaign and in editorials in El Siglo,
Gomez had said that he was opposed to peace talks with guerrillas
and that the army should wipe them out.
   At his news conference Thursday, the 69-year-old journalist also
said the Colombian military should be given full support until the
government can negotiate with the rebels.
   After his release, he indicated in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press on Wednesday night that he was not ruling out
a peaceful solution to 30 years of civil strife that has taken more
than 20,000 lives.
   ``The episode of my kidnapping has confirmed that we are living
in difficult times and that it is necessary to seek national
reconciliation,'' he said.
   The upcoming peace talks, scheduled for July 29 in Bogota,
sprang from negotiations in Panama toward Gomez Hurtado's release.
M-19 guerrilla leaders met there with Roman Catholic Church
intermediaries and members of Gomez Hurtado's party.
   The government refused to send a representative there and
rejected an M-19 demand that the Colombian government promise to
reopen peace talks with them before Gomez Hurtado's release.
   The M-19 freed him anyway.
   The army has said repeatedly it opposes talks with the rebels.
But military leaders say they will abide by the government's
decision.
   Former President Julio Cesar Turbay, also of Barco's Liberal
Party, indicated Thursday that the government is undecided.
   ``It is very difficult for me ... to say what should be done,''
Turbay told the Bogota radio station Caracol.
   During his 1978-1982 presidency, Turbay ordered the military to
destroy the guerrillas.
   The military and many businessmen, church leaders and
congressmen have said that 1982 peace negotiations, started by then
President Belisario Betancur, failed. They argue a cease-fire gave
the guerrillas time to build up their military forces.
   Betancur, interviewed Thursday by Caracol, said he favors new
negotiations. ``Dialogue is necessary now more than ever,'' he said.
   Since the collapse of the cease-fire, Colombia's guerrillas have
launched their strongest attacks ever in Colombia.
   They have raided towns, blown up bridges and electricity towers,
ambushed army patrols and bombed the government's main oil pipeline.
   The most brazen and bloodiest guerrilla operation was the M-19's
seizure of the federal Palace of Justice in Bogota on Nov. 7, 1985.
   The palace was destroyed by fire and 115 persons, including 11
Supreme Court magistrates, were killed.
   An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 guerrillas operate in Colombia.

   The ruling Sandinista party said
Thursday a new rebel leadership that includes a military commander
makes negotiating an end to the U.S.-supported war even more
difficult.
   Also Thursday, a military officer said the U.S.-backed rebels,
known as Contras, mounted several attacks this week to disrupt the
Sandinista government's celebration of its ninth anniversary. The
officer said 34 rebels were killed in fighting.
   An editorial in the Sandinista National Liberation Front's
newspaper Barricada said, ``It makes the possibility of negotiating
peace even more remote,'' referring to the election of Enrique
Bermudez to the seven-member Contra directorate.
   The paper said Bermudez's election at a meeting in the Dominican
Republic on Monday ``removes the civilian mask'' the Contras wore.
   Bermudez, commander of the main rebel army known as the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force, was a colonel in the national guard of
the Somoza dynasty that ruled Nicaragua for 42 years until it was
overthrown by the leftist Sandinistas in July 1979.
   He has long been a major point of friction in the Nicaraguan
Resistance coalition.
   Some members of the coalition are former Sandinistas, leery of a
return to a military-dominated government. At least five Southern
Front field commanders split away from the Resistance to protest
Bermudez's election.
   Claiming Bermudez's election was engineered by the CIA, the
Barricada editorial claimed that ``with the appointment of the new
directorate the CIA has ratified the Somoza leadership in the
movement, which years ago it made an effort to hide.''
   ``In order to ensure the survival of the Contras, the CIA has
been obliged to promote Bermudez to the highest level of
leadership,'' the newspaper said.
   A cease-fire has been in effect since March 21 in the 7-year-old
war between the Sandinista government and the Contras.
   On Tuesday, the ninth anniversary of the Sandinista guerrillas'
successful march into Managua, President Daniel Ortega announced a
unilateral extension of the cease-fire until Aug. 30. The Contras
have not yet said if they will do the same.
   No talks currently are scheduled for the attempt to reach a
lasting peace agreement. The last round broke off in June.
   Maj. Ramon Caldera, chief of the general staff for the Fifth
Military Region, reported on this week's Contra attacks at a
ceremony for the demobilization of 12,000 Sandinista army soldiers.
   Caldera said the attacks occurred in his command, which includes
central Chontales province and northern Boaco province. He gave no
details, except to say 34 rebels died in fighting.
   Caldera also claimed the Contras were secretly supplied with
weapons in four airdrops in northeastern Nueva Guinea province
during the first 15 days of July.
   A Defense Ministry statement said two rebels died Wednesday when
a Contra group attacked an army patrol in Buenos Aires, about 148
miles north of the capital. It said Contras kidnapped six civilians
in the northern part of the country on Sunday and Tuesday.
   The statement, which gave no details, also said 6 rebels
deserted to the Sandinista forces this week.

<HEAD>Firefighters Gaining Upper Hand on Wildfires in California,
Wyoming</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters gained the upper hand Thursday on wildfires that
charred some 12,500 acres in California and more than 17,000 acres
in the Teton Wilderness of Wyoming, but officials remained cautious.
   Meantime, more than 100 firefighters rushed to the Umatilla
National Forest in Oregon, where a fire that destroyed logging
equipment burned out of control, and fires that posed no immediate
threat to property or people burned in Utah.
   At least six states had fires raging, but blazes in Colorado and
Alaska were being brought under control or burning out.
   California firefighters carved control lines around twin
wildfires, leaving flames to gnaw mostly at uninhabited timber
country in rugged Calaveras County.
   The blazes that began Tuesday have razed six houses, including a
$600,000 two-story structure with contents the owners valued at
more than $400,000.
   ``There will never be a house like this again. You spend 49
years collecting things you love and in less than an hour, they're
gone,'' Hazel Burt said as she picked through the ruins.
   Authorities estimated the total timber and property losses plus
the costs of fighting the Calaveras blazes at $4.3 million,
although they said the figure would likely increase.
   Investigators found an incendiary device that was used to set
one of the two arson-suspected fires.
   Authorities predicted full containment by Friday evening.
   ``Firefighters are getting the upper hand,'' said Dick Craig, a
California Department of Forestry spokesman at the fire camp in
Rail Road Flat, 150 miles east of San Francisco and a few miles
west of the fires.
   Still, the pronouncement was cautious. ``Some of the lines
aren't very secure,'' Craig said.
   In Wyoming, crews combatted a wildfire in the Bridger-Teton
National Forest and gained the advantage by fighting fire with fire.
   Forest officials began talking in guarded terms of containment
following an intentional ``back burn'' of some 2,000 acres of
tinder-dry trees on the southern edge of the fire in the Teton
Wilderness.
   ``If we can hold on to what he have secured on the south end the
rest of today and tomorrow, we have turned the corner. We are
making good progress,'' said fire official Dale Jarrell.
   Firefighters ignited the area, on the edge of the densest area
of 15,000 acres of trees blown down last summer by a rare,
high-altitude tornado, by dropping chemical-filled pingpong balls
from a helicopter.
   The controlled burn, which was intended to keep the flames from
spreading into that dense area of trees, has allowed crews to get
that part of the fire 50 percent contained, said Fire Information
Officer Ed Waldapfel.
   ``We're a long ways from being out of the woods, but we're going
in the right direction,'' he said.
   In Oregon, Kathy Campbell, a spokeswoman for the Umatilla
National Forest, said about 130 federal firefighters, including
five 20-person fire crews and a 30-member supervisory team, were
assigned to the fire that destroyed logging equipment shortly after
breaking out Thursday afternoon.
   Oregon Department of Forestry spokesman Doug Decker said the
fire quickly grew to 150 acres and stiff winds and steep canyons
were causing concern for the firefighters.
   In Colorado, all but two of the fires that have charred more
than 21,000 acres since Saturday have been declared under control.
   And in Alaska, where fires have burned 1,300 square miles _
larger than Rhode Island _ this season, the state Fire Service has
left most blazes to burn themselves out. It has been monitoring
about 50 wildfires, some of them weeks old.
   The biggest is a 225,000-acre blaze 60 miles north of Fairbanks
that approached the Alaska pipeline earlier this month but was
stopped about 12 miles from it. The pipeline is covered with
heavy-gauge metal and was not threatened, Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. said.

<HEAD>U.S. Social Security Administration To Train Chinese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dorcas Hardy, head of the U.S. Social Security
Administration, said Friday his organization will train Chinese
managers for China's fledging efforts to set up retirement programs
for its aging work force.
   Ms. Hardy, who arrived in Beijing Monday at the invitation of
the Ministry of Labor, said 50 Chinese will be invited to the
United States next year to study how the 53-year-old American
social security system works.
   ``We are in a position to provide a helping hand in China's
progress'' in setting up programs for retirees, she said.
   She said that since her arrival, she had met officials from the
Civil Affairs and Labor ministries and the China Fund for the
Handicapped.
   Communist China has never developed a national pension program.
State-run factories are responsible for paying retirees up to 75
percent of their basic salaries, causing heavy financial burdens as
the number of retired workers increases and economic reforms put
more pressure on enterprises to turn in a profit.
   Farmers, accounting for more than three-fourths of China's
population of 1 billion, and the growing number of private
entrepreneurs often have no guaranteed source of income after
retirement.
   China is also facing a rapid aging of its population. The
percentage of those aged more than 60 will increase from 8.4
percent at present to 20 percent in the year 2025.
   Ms. Hardy said it was an ``undertaking of monumental proportions
when the most populous nation on earth begins to construct its own
social security program.''
   Ms. Hardy said she advised China to maintain its strong emphasis
on the family system, and to reconsider its mandatory retirement
age. Men in state-run enterprises now must retire at age 60. Most
women must leave work at age 55.
   She said she also discussed U.S. approaches to burden-sharing
among the government, the company and the employee. China recently
began experimenting with programs where the employee contributes a
small amount from his paycheck every month for retirement benefits.
Most workers in China still pay no direct social security tax.
   Ms. Hardy said most retirement payments in China are made
directly by the factory to its former employee. She saw little
evidence of computerization of records or the use of actuaries to
project future demographic trends. ``China must get a better
system,'' she said.

<HEAD>`The Film Society,' A New Play, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Jonathon is cq. No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monsters can be made out of the most ordinary of
men, according to playwright Jon Robin Baitz.
   It depends on how they adapt or accommodate themselves to the
world around them. And when the world is as stratified, rigid,
unfeeling and corrupt as the white South Africa portrayed in ``The
Film Society,'' they can develop into some pretty hard-hearted
creatures.
   ``The Film Society,'' which opened Thursday at off-Broadway's
Second Stage, examines one such sad and frightening tranformation.
The play is a promising New York stage debut for the 26-year-old
author, an American who lived in South Africa for six years.
   Baitz has come up with a provocative look at the depressing
metamorphosis of Jonathon Balton, a nebbish of a man who became a
schoolteacher because it's such a ``quiet'' occupation and because
he couldn't get a job as a radio actor.
   Jonathon teaches at Blenheim, an upper-crust boys school that
has fallen on hard times. The prep school serves as a microcosm for
white South African society.
   There are the members of the Old Guard, ruled by the headmaster,
a pragmatic man who is more concerned about the survival of the
school than the students. He is assisted by a fiery, right-wing
instructor who is dying of spinal cancer and who rails against
communism enveloping the country. They form the bulwark against the
younger teachers who presumably would be more enlightened about the
school and South African society.
   Jonathon will have none of it. Instead of teaching, he would
rather preside over the school's film society where he can screen
old Doris Day movies and block out his job and the real world.
   The time is the early 1970s, the years when Baitz also lived in
South Africa. The teachers and the students are aware of the racial
tumult outside the school but none of the strife is present at
Blenheim, a colonial institution that has outlived its usefulness.
   At first it seems as if Terry, a temperamental firebrand of a
teacher, will be the play's central character. It's Terry who sets
the play in motion, bringing in a black activist priest to speak at
the school's centenary celebration. The clergyman is arrested and
later dies in jail, supposedly of a heart attack. No one except
Terry and his wife, Nan, who also teaches at Blenheim, seems very
concerned.
   Jonathon's importance to the play is revealed gradually. His
mother, a member of the old aristocracy, uses her influence _ and
money _ to get him a better job at the school. At first, he is
willing to bring his friends along on his good fortune, but
practicality and ambition take over.
   Baitz is a strong, forceful writer. He's terrific at conjuring
up pictures of South African life. There are two such set pieces _
one a long description by Nan of a particularly recalcitrant
servant who worked for her parents, and the other a poignant
remembrance by Jonathon of his botched attempt to kill a cow in the
presence of his father's African workers.
   The play begins slowly, and director John Tillinger doesn't rush
the actors or the action. Each character is allowed to reveal
motivations gradually.
   Nathan Lane, who plays Jonathon, has always excelled in comic
roles, parts that demand a maximum of mugging. He has risen to a
different challenge here, capturing the man's ordinary qualities,
particularly when he tries to articulate his forlorn and pathetic
dreams about a show business career.
   William Glover and Dillon Evans are the very models of outdated
and unfeeling British propriety, while there is icy perfection from
Margaret Hilton as Jonathon's practical mother. Daniel Gerroll
exudes the righteous anger of Baitz's one-note radical teacher,
while Laila Robins brings an honesty to Nan, the play's one
sympathetic character.
   ``The Film Society'' is an impressive, intelligent effort by
Baitz, a playwright whose next work will be watched even more
closely.

   Cries of ``Viva Mike'' reverberated through the
convention hall Thursday night as Michael Dukakis gave part of his
acceptance speech for the Democratic presidential nomination in
Spanish.
   Dukakis spoke of Willie Velasquez, longtime head of the
Southwest Voter Education Project, who died recently.
   Dukakis paid tribute to Velasquez, stating both in English and
in Spanish that when Velasquez ``can register tens of thousands of
his fellow citizens to vote, bringing new energy, new ideas, new
people to the local and state governments in the Southwest, we are
all enriched and enobled.''
   Led by the Texas and Puerto Rico delegations, the hall erupted
in cheers of ``Viva Viva'' and ``Viva Mike.''
   Dukakis speaks fluent Spanish, having studied in South America
many years ago.

   Jesse Jackson's Democrats are leaving Atlanta
divided on the question of unity, with many warning that they need
time to heal their disappointment before they can judge Michael
Dukakis.
   ``It's much too early in the campaign for me to lay down my
Jackson sign and pick up a Dukakis sign,'' said LesKimber, a
Jackson delegate from Fresno, Calif. ``You can't turn off these
things like a water faucet.''
   Kimber and other Jackson delegates interviewed on the closing
night of the Democratic convention said they were wary of Dukakis
and reluctant for now to back his candidacy, Jackson's urging for
unity notwithstanding.
   Other Jackson supporters pledged their wholehearted support.

   Some delegates, like Sharon Mast, a school teacher from
Bellevue, Wash., even coveted the confetti that had rained down on
her head a few moments earlier.
   ``This isn't confetti at all,'' said the Dukakis delegate as she
scooped up a handful of the tiny, red, blue and silver pieces into
an envelope. ``This is magic fairy dust that will help us defeat

   Iran accused Iraq of trying to sabotage
U.N. efforts to end the 8-year-old Persian Gulf War by insisting on
face-to-face talks. Iraq refused to say whether it would accept a
U.N. cease-fire team.
   U.N. and Iranian officials said Thursday that the eight-person
U.N. team sent by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
arrange a cease-fire, would arrive Sunday in Tehran.
   Iraq, which has a string of major military victories, is

   Bolivia refused to send Roberto Suarez

officials say he is the biggest cocaine producer in the world.
   Suarez Gomez, accused of peddling cocaine by the ton through a
vast global network, was behind bars today after police trudged
through a jungle to one of his five ranches and arrested him as he
slept.
   ``President Victor Paz Estenssoro says he is very pleased with
Suarez Gomez's arrest and that the fight against drugs is the top
priority of the government,'' Interior Minister Juan Carlos Duran

   Duran said Bolivia will not extradite Suarez Gomez to the United

   The Labor Department said retail prices overall rose just 0.3
percent last month, the same as in May. Food price rises held to a

   A year ago, beaches were littered
with carcasses of bottlenose dolphins, killed by a disease
scientist still do not understand. This summer, there have been no
widespread reports of stranded dolphins, but scientists are not yet
sure whether that is good news.
   ``We're frankly very nervous ...,'' said Robert Schoelkopf of
the Marine Mammal Stranding Center based in Brigantine, N.J. ``This
may simply be a pause.'' On Wednesday, the center recovered a dead
bottlenose dolphin found on the beach in Long Branch, N.J.
Schoelkopf said he ruled out old age as a cause of death but was
not certain if the mammal, a female about 8 feet long, died from
the same malady that killed bottlenose dolphins last summer.
   Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said it does appear that deaths among
the bottlenose have subsided, compared with last year. ``The bad
news is we still don't understand what happened last year,'' he
said.

   No one would accuse Ray Combs, the new host of
CBS' ``Family Feud,'' of lack of confidence.
   ``Family Feud,'' he says, is ``the best vehicle to let me
display what I can do most naturally. There'll be some skeptics
until they see it, but they're going to have to love me. They're
not going to be able not to.
   ``I realized, this was my vehicle,'' he said. ``Just as Carson
had `Who Do You Trust?' Just as Merv Griffin had another show. Just
as Groucho had `You Bet Your Life.'''
   Combs might be following in the footsteps of Carson and Griffin
and Marx, but more immediately, the steps belong to Richard Dawson,
who, incidentally, is revising ``Who Do You Trust'' for NBC.
   It was Dawson who turned the silly game show of ``Family Feud''
into a personal stage for his wry humor. The show has been off the
air three years, but CBS brought it back earlier this month as part
of its daytime lineup.
   ``I don't hesitate to follow Richard at all,'' Combs said. ``I'm
excited that I'm following him, as opposed to anyone else
(following him). People say those are big shoes to fill. I don't
have to wear his shoes. I've got my own.''
   Combs grew up in Ohio, did Mormon missionary work in Arizona,
then moved to Indiana. He said he always knew he would become a
successful standup comedian, a belief not shared by his wife, his
childhood sweetheart.
   His greatest dream was to be on the ``Tonight Show'' with his
idol, Johnny Carson.
   ``That's why I went to California,'' Combs said, in between
tweaking a French waiter at the Manhattan restaurant where he was
having lunch.
   ``I would go to bed, and I would dream I was on Johnny Carson.
My wife wanted no part of it. She thought I was crazy, just crazy.''
   He moved to California without his wife, though she eventually
joined him. She still wasn't convinced that he could make a living
as a comedian, though.
   ``She knew there were more astronauts than comedians,'' Combs
said. ``She tried to get me to go to Houston _ `Honey, there are
300 astronauts, if you want a stupid dream ...'''
   Combs gave up his job at Levitz Furniture and started playing
the clubs full time.
   Then he started getting jobs warming up the studio audiences for
sitcoms, such as ``Golden Girls'' and ``Facts of Life.'' The
experience of playing amidst TV equipment in front of an audience
that doesn't expect or want to see a comedian honed his instincts.
   Carson, whose company produces ``Amen,'' came to a taping and
caught Combs' act.
   The dream came true, and Combs appeared on ``The Tonight Show.''
   ``It was the thousandth time I would be in front of a studio
audience, where for most comedians it was their first,'' he said.
``They get scared. I felt like Mike Tyson. I said, `I can't wait,
open those curtains! I've been waiting my whole life for this!
   ``The curtains opened, and I walked out. You couldn't see the
people because the lights were so bright. I'd never had that. So I
come out, the first joke kind of shocked me, but I heard them laugh
and I trusted that they were there. And as I did my routine, I
became relaxed, and I started to even do things, this is what made
me different, I did things I had never done before. I started
making things up that I had never done, my first time.
   ``You have six minutes. At the end of that six minutes, every
comic knows the signs. If Johnny's smiling really big or talking to
the guy beside him, and gives you one of these (an `OK' sign), that
means you're coming back, and everybody knows Johnny has the best
feel for who the best young comics are.''
   Combs said his time flew and he was shocked when the stage
manager made the gesture telling him to wrap it up.
   ``I didn't end on a joke. The only thing I could think to do was
be honest. I looked at the crowd and said, `Folks, all my life I've
had a dream that I would be on this show, and tonight you've made
my dream become a reality, and I thank you very much.'
   ``When it was over, they started clapping, and I just saw
twinkling, I didn't know what it was. It was the crowd standing up.
It was a standing ovation. It was the first time in the 25-year
history of the `Tonight Show' that any comic got a standing
ovation, and when I looked over at Johnny, he was going, `Come over
here.'''

   Producer George Schlatter says his new NBC
summer show ``Funny People'' may not be the son of ``Real People''
but is certainly its grandchild.
   ``I think it has its roots in `Real People,' as does a lot of
television today,'' said Schlatter. ``We did a lot of funny stories
in `Real People,' but this is all about people who are funny. Some
are funny on purpose, some who are not intentionally funny and some
of the people are behind funny people.
   ``When we started `Real People' in 1979, the country was at a
low point in self-esteem and pride. We came on, opened the show
with the flag, talked about the little guy and celebrated heroes. I
think it affected the country's self-esteem. Today, we desperately
need to laugh.''
   Schlatter's name has been associated with laughter for many
years. He produced the innovative ``Laugh-In'' series in the 1960s.
He also initiated and produces the annual ``Comedy Awards.''
   ``George Schlatter's Funny People'' makes its debut Wednesday
for a one-hour look at funny people, places and events. The hosts
are comedians Blake Clark, Rita Rudner, Scott Blakeman and reporter
Leeza Gibbons of ``Entertainment Tonight.''
   The show, like Schlatter's ``Real People,'' which ran on NBC
from 1979 to 1984, begins with the hosts on stage. They will
introduce segments taped all over this country, along with special
features from abroad.
   ``We're doing a lot of pieces on people who make us laugh,''
said Schlatter. ``Some are comedians, filmmakers, eccentrics. We're
taping a lot of them on location. We have people in Japan, England,
Canada and Australia making tapes. We sent Blake Clark to interview
people at the Democratic Convention in Atlanta. It was tough
getting credentials, but it helps to know people in low places.
We're going to have somebody at the Republican Convention.
   ``We also have an army of kids out there doing videos for us. We
went to the schools and video departments to recruit them. We'll
use the best and give each student whose tape is selected a Sony
8mm CamCorder.''
   All of the comedian-hosts had appeared on the syndicated show
``George Schlatter's Comedy Club.''
   ``Leeza came over to do a story on the show for `Entertainment
Tonight,''' said Schlatter. ``I told her it was time for her number
and we put her in the finale. She got up and did it. She wasn't a
bit nervous. So when this came up I called her.''
   Each show will consist of eight to 10 segments. Schlatter said
so many are coming in that his editing house is operating 24 hours
a day. He is now installing computerized editing equipment.
   ``The trouble with television today is that it's getting so
careful and so repetitive,'' he said. ``... Car crashes, drugs and
women in jeopardy. The sitcoms are all the same. They solve every
problem in 30 minutes. I can't even understand the problem in 30
minutes. The only thing different on TV today is Tracey Ullman and
Garry Shandling.
   ``Another thing is that everybody on TV sounds alike. Well,
Blake's from Georgia. Scott's from Brooklyn, Rita's from Miami,
Leeza's from South Carolina. We'll have some accents. I don't want
it to be the same as everything else on TV. We're trying to have
some fun with `Funny People' and bring some joy to people. We'll
also ruffle a few feathers. I want it to be an adventure.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME _ Margaret Richard, the host of public
television's ``The Body Electric,'' warns against doing aerobic
running and jumping at home. ``Aerobics at home can be dangerous
because individuals are exercising mainly on inappropriate floors
which don't offer protection against injury or strain,'' she said.
``It damages joints and ligaments. It's called the `overuse
syndrome,' which is a whole new area of sports medicine. Aerobics
should be done only in a proper environment.''
   Richard, whose exercise program appears on 85 public stations as
well as many cable systems, recommends a home program of repetitive
exercises for muscle toning.

<HEAD>Kansas City Group Fighting LA Gangs' Infiltration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SELSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Los Angeles gangs spreading their
drug-dealing to Kansas City, a citizens' anti-crime group is
fighting to keep the city's youth from falling prey to the lure of
flash and money.
   Members of two gangs _ the Bloods, who identify themselves by
wearing red clothing or red bandannas, and the Crips, who wear blue
_ have been infiltrating Kansas City for months.
   On May 13, a member of the Crips was arrested after he arrived
in Kansas City by train from Los Angeles, allegedly carrying more
than 20 pounds of cocaine worth $1.2 million.
   Police in dozens of cities are alarmed that the Los Angeles
gangs are exporting their drug trade. Earlier this month, 50 law
enforcement officers from 11 cities in the Midwest and the West
attended a two-day conference in Kansas City to develop a national
strategy to fight the gangs.
   But long before, members of the 11-year-old Ad Hoc Group Against
Crime began drawing their own battle lines in the anti-gang,
anti-drug war.
   Ad Hoc has had success in helping police solve murders, rapes
and robberies. Now the group is also focusing on keeping the young
from becoming casualties of drugs.
   Ad Hoc, a grass-roots organization whose 240 members are mostly
black, was created in 1977 to ease tensions between blacks and
police. It has since grown into a citizens' anti-crime group
meeting monthly, and anyone is eligible to join.
   Drugs have been a problem for years, but Ad Hoc founder Alvin
Brooks says that now, some streets ``have been taken over by
pushers.''
   In one housing development he cited, small groups of young drug
dealers, many wearing blue and red, lounge in the shade of trees.
Parked nearby are shiny, new luxury sedans, seemingly incongruous
among the rows of drab, three-story brick buildings.
   A police officer patrolling the area said some of the young men
wearing blue or red were Crips and Bloods.
   To a youngster raised in a poor neighborhood, a drug dealer
driving a luxury car with a pocket full of cash can be someone to
admire. A teen-ager working as a lookout, decoy or courier for a
dealer can earn more in a day than he could in a week in a
minimum-wage job.
   Ad Hoc has approached the dealers head-on. For more than two
years, it has conducted harassment campaigns against suspected drug
houses, in some cases rolling caskets past, carrying signs and
warning with bullhorns that pushers should leave.
   ``We did not feel at any time that we were encroaching on the
rights of drug dealers,'' Brooks said, ``but felt they were
encroaching on the rights of the community, by their drug-dealing.''
   Hoping to show the unglamorous side of drugs, Ad Hoc is
organizing trips to penitentiaries and to courts for drug trials.
Earlier this month, 24 youths joined in the first prison visit;
Brooks hopes 400 will do so by summer's end.
   ``This is not so much to scare the kids, but to let them see and
hear what their idolized status-symbol role models are doing to the
community, and to see the end results of drug dealing,'' said
Brooks, who is Kansas City's director of human relations.
   Ad Hoc, which is supported by private donations, plans to begin
instructing parents how to recognize signs that their children are
becoming involved with gangs or drugs.
   The group recently opened a youth drug abuse hotline, and
although it hasn't been publicized, volunteer workers answering the
telephones have been overwhelmed with calls, Brooks said.
   The phone line exists so callers can report suspected drug
users, ask questions about drugs, and discuss their own problems.
   In late June, Ad Hoc counselors, some of whom are reformed drug
users, began visiting the homes of children identified as just
getting involved in drugs, to try to get the parents and children
together to discuss the problem, Brooks said.
   Brooks said some parents may consider the counselors intrusive,
but that the effort had to be made.
   ``We can not wait around until drugs strike a person and he or
she is destroyed,'' he said. ``We have to at least broach the
subject.''
   Ad Hoc workers try to help teen-agers find jobs and expose them
to organizations such as the Boy's Club.
   The presence of gangs raises the stakes, and Brooks said
killings could increase unless action is taken.
   ``We're aware of the amount of drugs and guns out there in the
streets of Kansas City, and a spark can ignite it all,'' he said.
   Capt. Sylvester Winston, who heads the police department's
homicide unit, has a particular interest in seeing Ad Hoc's efforts
work.
   Winston, who has been a member of Ad Hoc almost since its
inception, says at least 50 percent of the homicides in the city
are directly related to drugs.
   About 80 percent of all homicides in the city have been solved
in the past year, due in part to Ad Hoc's help, Winston said.
   Ad Hoc, he said, has a close relationship with the police and
great respect in the community.
   Asked if he feared it might turn into a vigilante group, Winston
said members realize they must obey the laws but added, ``(It)
could if dope dealers keep killing our kids.''

   The headline on the story last week might have
gone something like this: ``Peace Breaks Out In Gulf; We'll Be
Paying More for Gas.''
   No non sequitur there. It was just a typical day in the oil
futures market, where headlines _ of good news or bad _ can move
prices faster and further than any fundamental law of economics.
   On July 18, world oil markets got wind of a possible cease-fire
agreement in the nearly 8-year-old war between Persian Gulf
protagonists Iran and Iraq. Prices for future delivery of crude oil
shot up nearly $1 a barrel to near $16.
   The runup was bullish news for oil traders, who had languished
through the summer watching prices sink far below the official OPEC
price of $18.
   But wait a second. Shouldn't peace in the war-torn gulf be
bearish news for prices? After all, you figure prices should drop
in an already glutted market if they stop mining the waters and
shooting at ships. Right?
   Wrong. Peace was viewed that particular Monday as a sign the
fractious Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might seize
the opportunity to cut production and bolster prices.
   There has been a lot of cheating going on in the cartel,
particularly by the war's combatants who have been pumping oil to
finance their fight. If they suddenly decide to lay down their
arms, it is also possible the cartel members could get together on
production and pricing.
   Instant analysis aside, is peace really bullish or bearish for
prices?
   ``You could argue that one until the cows come home,'' answered
one trader eager to move on to more definitive issues last week.
   Traders never seem much in the mood for long-winded debates. Why
let fundamentals, like supply and demand, confuse the picture? The
real action comes off the headline, no matter what it says.
   Just last year, prices were also on the rise in mid-July, but
the news in the gulf was very different. Tensions were high, and
Iran was threatening to sink any oil tankers moving through the
region under the protective flag of the United States.
   In response to that news, prices surged above $22 a barrel for
the first time in 18 months on the theory that heightened
hostilities would lead to at least a temporary cutoff of oil
shipments.
   A quick review of a reporter's notes on the war-price
relationship over the last 12 months would therefore produce the
following rock-solid formulas:
   1. In the summer of 1987, war equaled higher prices.
   2. In the summer of 1988, peace equals higher prices.
   Applying such axioms to the oil market will not earn high marks
when supplies are plentiful and traders look to the news to create
some precious volatility.
   Of course, the apparent contradiction makes perfect sense to the
oil traders themselves. War in 1987 threatened involuntary
restraints on oil supplies; peace a year later holds the promise of
voluntary limits imposed by a rejuvenated OPEC.
   Elementary, perhaps, for a commodity trader, but dangerous for
the rest of us, who only want to know if the price of gasoline is
going up before we fill up for the summer trip to grandma's.
   The advice from one expert, Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., is to watch the paper for more than a day or two
before jumping to conclusions.
   ``Over a longer period of time, (the relationship between market
movements and gas prices) is almost one-to-one,'' said Baker. ``But
in the near term, there's too much static in there to tie the two
together.''

   Maybe, just maybe, nations are turning to
diplomacy to end wars that have littered the world with millions of
corpses, turned even more millions into refugees and filled
hospitals with maimed and crippled men, women and children. Here is
a report on recent worldwide steps toward the rule of reason rather
than force.

<TEXT>
   When Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran
dramatically said yes to a cease-fire in its war with Iraq, it
became the latest in a string of nations to opt for a peaceful
solution to a bloody war that failed.
   The eight-year conflict with Iraq had already cost both sides an
estimated 1 million casualties, drained their economies and kept
the Middle East at boiling point.
   But in a sudden reversal of policy, Iran on Monday, July 18,
accepted a United Nations resolution calling on both Iraq and Iran
to silence their guns _ a resolution Iraq had accepted a year ago.
   Just a little before, South Africa, Angola and Cuba agreed to a
set of principles to end decade-long clashes among their troops in
southern Angola, and to give South-West Africa (Namibia), also the
scene of guerrilla fighting, its independence.
   Then on Thursday, July 21, North Korea invited the South Korean
parliament to begin talks with its Communist counterpart on a
non-aggression pact drawn up in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
   The two countries have lived under an uneasy truce that brought
a war between them to a halt in 1953. Each has accused the other of
warlike acts since then and tension has run high at times along the
demilitarized zone that separates them.
   Korea has been divided between north and south since the end of
World War II.
   The three events last week came against a backdrop of other
recent moves toward peace and a lessening of world tension:
   _The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan after nine years of war.
   _Reports of Soviet troop reductions in Hungary and perhaps other
East bloc nations.
   _Continuing U.S.-Soviet talks on deeper nuclear-weapons cuts.
   _Talks beginning Monday, July 25, for a peaceful solution to the
long guerrilla war in Cambodia, to be followed by talks on Cambodia
between the Soviet Union and China, the world's two most powerful
communist nations.
   ``It's a very refreshing sign in 1988 that so many problems are
now being approached in a different way,'' said Sir Crispin
Tickell, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, who sits on
the Security Council. ``I call it a victory for common sense.''
   ``Let's hope peace is contagious,'' added the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, Vernon A. Walters, who is also on the Security
Council. ``People are tired.''
   By far, the most stunning development was Iran's sudden
abandonment of its longstanding demand that Iraq be branded the
aggressor in their war as a first step toward peace.
   Iraq had proposed face-to-face negotiations with Iran, fearing a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire effort could stop short of peace.
   So far Iran has rejected direct talks, leading Baghdad to
suggest Tehran's acceptance of a cease-fire may be only a tactic as
part of an ongoing war.
   However, Security Council Resolution 598, which Iran accepted
unconditionally, contains provisions for a peace process after a
cease-fire is established.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has dispatched
military observers to begin working out details of a cease-fire,
and diplomats say it looks as though peace could come to the front
for the first time since September 1980.
   Nearly as startling as Iran's move was South Africa's agreement
the week before last with Angola and Cuba on principles for the
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola and to end South
African rule over neighboring South-West Africa.
   A timetable for the Cuban withdrawal has not yet been set, but
the three nations agreed the United Nations will supervise
elections and the establishment of black majority rule in
South-West Africa over a one-year period.
   South Africa has governed the territory under a League of
Nations mandate granted during World War I. The U.N. Security
Council revoked the mandate in 1978, calling for an independent
Namibia.

   Cuban troops have been defending the Marxist government of
Angola from an anti-communist insurgency by UNITA, the National
Union for the Total Liberation of Angola, and recently the Cubans
and their Angolan allies have clashed with South African troops
sent over the border from Namibia to back UNITA. UNITA has also
received diplomatic and military support from the United States.
   Even earlier, at the U.N. General Assembly's special session on
disarmament in June, many nations lauded recent U.S.-Soviet
diplomatic agreements on nuclear arms reduction, saying their
example should inspire regional powers and the developing nations
to reach peace pacts and reduce their arsenals.
   And in Central Europe, the Warsaw Pact allies offered this month
to negotiate conventional force imbalances with their NATO
counterparts this year and accepted the West's demand that the
talks cover weapons as well as troop levels.
   The U.S. State Department said earlier this month that it
appears Moscow may withdraw 65,000 Red Army troops from Hungary or
10,000 from Poland as a unilateral gesture.
   The Warsaw Pact has called for each side to reduce its forces by
about 500,000 troops.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have said the
Warsaw Pact has superior forces, and must make greater reductions
than the West.
   In Afghanistan, the Soviet withdrawal that began May 15
continues under U.N. supervision, and is to be completed by Feb.
15, 1989, ending nine years of Kremlin effort to put down armed
opposition to the communist Kabul government by Moslem guerrillas,
known as Mujahedeen. The accords were mediated by the United
Nations and signed by neighbors Pakistan and Afghanistan, with
Washington and Moscow acting as guarantors.
   A decade-long guerrilla war in Cambodia could begin winding down
after peace talks start Monday in Bogor, Indonesia.
   Communist Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the
communist Khmer Rouge, who held power since 1975. About 2 million
of Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions,
famine and civil unrest until the Vietnamese ended their rule.
   The Khmer Rouge turned to guerrilla warfare, and since 1979 has
been the most powerful force battling Heng Samrin's government in
Phnom Penh, which is supported by about 140,000 of Hanoi's troops.
   The coalition of Cambodian resistance groups also includes the
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front, and
followers of the former Cambodian head of state, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk. China is the main supporter of the resistance.
   Vietnam is withdrawing its troops from Cambodia and says they
all will be out by 1990. Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of
Vietnam has said that the long anti-guerrilla campaign has become
``Vietnam's Vietnam.''
   The Indonesian talks will be the first among all of Cambodia's
warring groups.
   In addition to the three guerrilla groups and the current
Cambodian government, the talks will include Vietnam, Laos and the
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations _ Thailand,
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
   A diplomatic approach to three insurgencies in Central America
has met only limited success.
   Last August, the presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Costa Rica signed a peace accord that links truces in
Central America with the withdrawal of military forces and
equipment supplied by outside powers and the restoration of civil
liberties.
   Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega last Tuesday extended a
unilateral truce in the 7-year-old war against the Contra rebels
until Aug. 30, and called on the U.S.-backed Contras to resume
talks to work out a permanent cease-fire.
   The Contras seem unprepared to handle a peace process; rifts
within their ranks between those who want to fight and those who
are willing to discuss a poltical settlement have left the rebels
in disarray.
   An impasse has developed in El Salvador, where cancer-stricken
President Jose Napoleon Duarte has called upon leftist rebel groups
to lay down their weapons after eight years of guerrilla war and
join the constitutional process of government.
   In Guatemala, the peace plan stalled when the Guatemalan Workers
Party, the political front for leftist rebels, declared a
government general amnesty offer ``unacceptable.''

   Informal negotiations set for Monday
have sparked a glimmer of hope that two decades of savage conflict
in Cambodia may end through political compromise.
   For the first time, officials of the squabbling Cambodian
resistance coalition are scheduled to meet with representatives of
the Heng Samrin government that Vietnam installed in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia's capital, after its 1978 invasion of its neighbor.
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia, who cautions against
``unrealistic'' expectations for the talks, will serve as
moderator. The meetings are to be held at the presidential palace
in Bogor, a mountain retreat about 40 miles south of Jakarta.
   More than 30 years ago the palace was the site for a meeting of
prime ministers from Burma, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and
Pakistan. The meeting led to the Afro-Asia Conference in nearby
Bandung in 1955 that preceded the formation of the Non-Aligned
Movement, more commonly called the Third World.
   If Monday's opening session goes smoothly, it will be expanded
later in the week to include Vietnam, Laos, and delegates from the
six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations _
Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Brunei.
   The phased nature of the gathering was conceived three years ago
by Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, then Indonesia's foreign minister. He
decided that a casual ``cocktail party'' format where everyone
could come but at different times might finally succeed in bringing
the warring factions together.
   Moderator Alatas and others stress that the informal talks have
no agenda, are preliminary in nature and are designed to find
enough common ground on which to base formal negotiations.
   Since 1970, Cambodia has suffered a devastating five-year war, a
reign of terror by the communist Khmer Rouge, the Vietnamese
invasion and a continuing guerrilla war. Millions have perished.
   Contributing to the cautious optimism was a report from
Washington that the envoys of the Soviet Union and China have
agreed to meet in Beijing next month to work on a Cambodian peace
plan. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting hinged on developments in Bogor.
   While neither the Soviets nor the Chinese have a direct role in
the long-running conflict, both hold sway over allies who are
directly involved. Moscow backs Vietnam, and China arms the
coalition guerrillas.
   Vietnam's leader, Nguyen Van Linh, said all Vietnamese troops
will leave Cambodia by early 1990, instead of the end of 1990 as
previously announced, according to a Vietnam News Agency report
monitored Friday in Bangkok, Thailand.
   Deep suspicions over Vietnam's motives remain in some quarters.
So do fears of a return to power by the brutal Khmer Rouge, the
strongest member of a coalition that seems to stick together
because they hate Vietnam slightly more than each other. The others
are anti-communists under former Premier Son Sann and followers of
Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Sihanouk, who resigned on July 10 as head of the resistance
coalition, accused Vietnam on Thursday of being unwilling to
conduct serious talks.
   He is not supposed to appear in Bogor but has accepted an
invation to visit Indonesia for a few days this week as the
personal guest of President Suharto. Alatas said Sihanouk's son,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, would head his father's faction in the
talks.

<TEXT>
   Thirty-five years after an armistice
ended the Korean War, tensions on the divided peninsula remain high
and conditions for another war are still there.
   The war of 1950-53 left both nations in devastation and more
than 1 million soldiers and civilians dead or wounded. The United
States committed 5.7 million soldiers, sailors and airmen to the
Korean War under the banner of the United Nations and 33,629 of
them died in battle.
   Today hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops of both
sides face each other along the 150-mile Demilitarized Zone in
virtually the same positions they held the day the armistice was
signed _ July 27, 1953.
   Pro-Western South Korea and Communist North Korea each insists
it is the only legitimate government and both struggle now for
supremacy on the 600-mile peninsula.
   Reuniting Korea is the goal of both governments, but each calls
the other puppets _ the South of the Americans and the North of the
Soviets.
   Technically, the North and the South are still at war; while an
armistice ended the fighting in 1953, no peace treaty has been
signed. The two nations have no ties, the Demilitarized Zone which
divides them at the 38th Parallel is sealed and they have no links
except for a single hotline.
   The two sides have been engaged in frequent clashes since 1953
but so far they have avoided another war. Few signs point to an
end, however, to one of the world's most dangerous power struggles.
   President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea called on July 7 for an end
to confrontation and the opening of peaceful ties. He proposed
trade, political and cultural links to lead to eventual
reunification.
   ``We should be able to find a breakthrough toward a lasting
peace and unification on the Korean peninsula, which is still
fraught with the danger of war,'' Roh said.
   North Korea ridiculed Roh's plan and said it was not worth
considering. The North also refused to even accept a letter from
the South on July 15 calling for student exchange visits.
   South Korea, however, said it would at least consider a North
Korean proposal July 21 for inter-parliamentary talks on a framing
a non-aggression pact.
   Roh's proposals were similar to other iniatives by the South and
there was little sign the new ones would lead to a breakthrough.
Three rounds of talks between the two nations since 1971 on
reducing tensions and building ties collapsed.
   Both want to reunite the peninsula, but neither is willing to
abandon its political system or renounce its claims to be the sole
government of Korea.
   South Korea achieved a major political and diplomatic victory
over the North by becoming the site for the 1988 Olympic Games,
starting in September. The South makes little secret of the fact
that it sees the games as international recognition of its claim to
be the true Korean government.
   ``The Olympics will mark a critical turning point for Seoul to
achieve permanent superiority over Pyongyang,'' the official Korean
Development Institute of Seoul said in a report. Pyongyang is North
Korea's capital.
   North Korea, furious over Seoul's Olympics accomplishment, plans
to boycott the games unless it can be the co-host. Olympic
authorities have refused and the North's hopes of a major boycott
by its Communist allies collapsed when the Soviet Union and China
entered the Games.
   The Korean peninsula was divided by Soviet and U.S. forces that
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. Efforts
to reunite failed and rival governments were formed in 1948. The
North invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War.
   In addition to the United States, 15 other nations sent troops
to help South Korea during the war and today 42,000 U.S. troops
remain in the country.
   Memories of the war haunt both nations and fuel mutual mistrust.
   ``The Korean War made unification an impossible task,'' said
Choi Jank-sok, a South Korean political analyst. ``Tensions between
the two Koreas have never been reduced,''
   South Korean cities hold monthly air raid drills, men serve in
militias or civil defense units until they are 50 years old and
army units on maneuvers are a common sight. Seoul is dotted with
gun emplacements disguised as flower beds and fortifications ring
the city, which is within artillery range of North Korea.
   North Korea has repeatedly attacked the South, including a 1983
bombing against former President Chun Doo-hwan and his Cabinet that
killed 16 people.
   The North was implicated in the bombing Nov. 29 of a South
Korean airliner with the loss of all 115 people aboard as part of
attempts to disrupt the Olympics.
   North Korea is one of the most regimented police states in the
world with the government controlling almost every aspect of life.
The country is virtually closed to foreigners.
   Its supreme leader, 75-year-old Kim Il Sung, has built up a huge
personality cult that portrays him as a sort of Marxist god. People
are drilled from childhood to revere him as the ``Great Leader.''
   Kim, who has been in power since 1945, started the Korean War
and observers say unification is impossible while he rules the
North.
   ``Nothing has changed in the North, and as a matter of fact the
situation in the North is getting worse,'' said Professor Rhee
Chong-ik of South Korea's Chongju University.
   North Korea, with a population of just 20 million, has the sixth
largest army in the world with 800,000 troops and as many as 5
million in reserve. It has a 3-to-1 lead in jets aircraft, tanks
and other weapons, but much of its weaponry is old and one third of
its planes are of Korean War vintage, according to Western
estimates.
   North Korea, hobbled by bureaucracy, also has seen its economy
fall into chaos. Huge resources are swallowed up by the army, life
in the North is spartan and there are reports of food shortages.
   The balance of power has changed in recent years as the South's
soaring economy has turned it into a growing Asian power. The
South, with a population of 41 million, has outstripped the North
at almost every level.
   Seoul's increasingly powerful military, with 650,000 men and 3
million reserves, has a technological lead that outweighs the
North's numerical superiority, analysts say. South Korean leaders
say they will be able to do without U.S. military aid by the late
1990s.
   The Roh government, which took office in February, has pledged
to end decades of authoritarian rule in the South and a major
political liberalization has been the result. The government says
it is building a democratic system that will end South Korea's
internal divisions.
   Some political leaders, intellectuals and others say the reforms
must include a major effort to end the confrontation with the North.
   ``As the United States deals with the Soviet Union we can deal
with North Korea _ with a careful and sincere attitude,'' said
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung.
   Reunification has been freely debated in the South as the
government lifted controls that had made the subject taboo. South
Koreans want reunification, but not if it means Communist rule.
   Peace advocates hope better relations between the superpowers
can ease the confrontation.
   ``It would be exceedingly difficult for North Korea to resist
the trend of the times and insist on keeping its doors hermetically
sealed,'' said analyst Kim Young-won.

   The publisher of Business Week is investigating
unusual movements in stocks mentioned in its Wall Street column
before issues of the magazine hit the streets, a spokeswoman says.
   Mary McGeachy said Thursday that McGraw-Hill Inc.'s legal
counsel began tracking stocks mentioned in the magazine's ``Inside
Wall Street'' column ``some time back'' after noticing unusual
rises a day after the magazine was printed but before it reached
newsstands.
   The probe is reminiscent of a case involving the Wall Street
Journal in which a reporter passed advance information on columns
to a stockbroker who profited from the knowledge. But McGeachy said
McGraw-Hill's investigation was not limited to Business Week's

   General Motors Corp. reports that its profit rose

   Analysts said the gains in domestic sales reported Thursday

market share erode in recent years.
   GM had after-tax earnings of $1.5 billion, or $4.52 a share, in

years and an increase of 53 percent from the same quarter of 1987.

   Energy futures have rallied for a second

   The September contract for the benchmark U.S. crude oil, West
Texas Intermediate, rose 34 cents to close at $16.39 a barrel

to 45.53 cents a gallon.
   Prices had moved out of a prolonged slump on Wednesday amid
reports about the proposed cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the
possibility of a meeting of OPEC's pricing committee.
   But there were no new developments to influence trading
Thursday, said Jim Fiedler, a vice president at E.D.&F. Man
International Futures Inc.
   ``You're having a technical correction to a bear market,''
Fiedler said.
   Most traders are bullish for the short-term because of the
prospect of peace in the Persian Gulf, Fiedler said. They believe
an end to the 8-year-old war will remove the threat of oil supplies
being interrupted by the hostilities.
   But in the long-term, Fiedler said, many traders are bearish
because both countries could step up oil production _ adding to the
glut on worldwide markets _ as they try to repair their economies
following the war.
   Fiedler described the market as nervous in advance of a possible
Aug. 3 meeting of officials of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to discuss pricing and production levels.

   American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s chairman,
dismayed by an unexpected spurt in employment, has announced a
companywide hiring freeze and ordered a shift of 3,000 managers
into sales and marketing.
   The freeze is the first since the breakup of the Bell System in
1984 and may be the first ever for AT&T, which was sheltered from
competition for most of its existence.
   The freeze, which will last indefinitely, excludes only some
college recruiting and ``jobs that are strategic to marketing
efforts here and abroad,'' spokesman Burke Stinson said Thursday.
   After shrinking steadily since 1984, when it divested the
regional Bell telephone companies, AT&T's employment has risen by
12,000 since the beginning of this year.
   AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen, who announced the plan to
employees in a closed-circuit television broadcast Wednesday, said
administrative costs were rising too rapidly and he wanted to
emphasize increasing sales.
   On Wednesday, the company reported an unusually large 14 percent
second-quarter increase in its selling, general and administrative
expenses. That rise, which AT&T now is moving to deal with,
contributed to a 0.3 percent slippage in profits.
   AT&T is recruiting volunteers for sales and marketing jobs from
among its 95,000 entry-level and second-level managers, although
all managers are eligible, Stinson said.
   ``We're moving people from field tents to the front line,''
Stinson said. AT&T continues to lose money in the computer business
and has been hard-pressed by competitors in long-distance telephone
service, its bread-and-butter business. MCI Communications Corp.,
its closest rival, this week reported record profit and revenue for
the latest quarter.
   Stinson said Allen regards the employment increase this year as
unacceptable, although one reason for the sharp rise is that AT&T
began counting the 4,500 employees of AT&T Philips
Telecommunications, a European joint venture with NV Philips in
which AT&T took a majority interest earlier this year.
   James E. Olson, Allen's predecessor, who died in April after a
bout with colon cancer, oversaw a reduction of 27,000 employees in
his 1{ years at the helm.
   AT&T's employment fell from 374,000 at the time of divestiture
on Jan. 1, 1984, to 365,200 at the end of 1984, 337,600 at the end
of 1985, 316,900 at the end of 1986 and 303,000 at the end of 1987.
It is now about 315,000.
   Of the 3,000 people moving into sales, more than 1,000 already
have been recruited, Stinson said. That is because the move to
shift people into sales began in April in two AT&T units, the
Business Markets Group and Network Operations Group.

<HEAD>Maxwell Offers $2.07 Billion for Macmillan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Britain's Robert Maxwell has emerged as a bidder
to compete with hostile suitor Robert Bass for Macmillan Inc., but
apparently not as the ``white knight'' that many analysts have been
expecting to appear and rescue Macmillan.
   Maxwell Communications, the media company headed by the
flamboyant publisher, said Thursday it had offered to buy Macmillan
in a conditional bid that values the company at $2.07 billion.
   Maxwell stated he would pay $80 a share for the 25.9 million
outstanding shares of Macmillan, the publishing giant that already
faces a hostile $1.9 billion tender offer from Robert M. Bass Group.
   But Macmillan issued a brief statement saying the Maxwell offer
was unsolicited and would be considered ``in due course'' along
with the Bass bid.
   Macmillan stock closed up $4.25 at $82.87{ per share, reflecting
speculation that a higher bid yet would emerge.
   Bass, which already holds a 9.9 percent stake in Macmillan,
launched a $75-a-share tender offer Monday for the shares it does
not already own. The spokesman for Bass was said to be out of his
office and unavailable for comment Thursday.
   Edward P. Evans, Macmillan's chairman and chief executive
officer, stated that Macmillan ``vigorously'' was attempting to
overturn a ruling that prevents the company from proceeding with an
extensive restructuring program announced after Bass's initial
overtures.
   The restructuring, which includes paying shareholders a special
dividend and splitting the company into two separate public
entities, was blocked last week by the Delaware Chancery Court at
Bass's request. Macmillan is appealing to the Delaware Supreme
Court.
   Maxwell's offer was conditioned upon the termination of the
restructuring plan and Macmillan's ``poison pill'' takeover
defense, and approval by the Macmillan board and shareholders.
   In a letter to Evans, Maxwell also requested his company get the
same access to confidential corporate information as Macmillan's
investment bankers.
   Maxwell Communications' North American headquarters, based in
Greenwich, Conn., control printing, telecommunications, database
services and publishing operations with annual revenue approaching
$1 billion.
   Some of the operations compete against Macmillan's publishing
and information services units, a Macmillan spokesman said.
   Bert Boksen, an analyst at Raymond James Financial Corp. in St.
Petersburg, Fla., said the entry of Maxwell into the bidding
``further complicates the situation for the Macmillan board ... it
will probably force them to find a true `white knight.'''
   He predicted a third bidder would surface and an auction would
ensue that would send Macmillan to the highest bidder.
   ``I still think the company is worth $90 to $95 a share,''
Boksen said.
   Coniston Partners, an aggressive New York investment firm that
holds a 4.9 stake in Macmillan, has maintained the company is worth
at least $85 a share.
   Robert Maxwell's worldwide operations reported 1987 sales of 884
million pounds, or about $1.53 billion at current exchange rates.
   In his most recent annual report, Maxwell said the company was
``on the road to becoming a global information and communications
empire before the end of the decade, with annual revenues of 3 to 5
million pounds with profit to match.''
   Maxwell's company is the largest printer in Britain, owns the
Mirror group of newspapers in Britain and publishes scientific
journals.
   Maxwell recently encountered the Bass group when it acquired a
2.3 percent stake in Bell & Howell Co. Maxwell ultimately decided
against making a bid for the Illinois information services company,
which Bass acquired in May for $700 million.
   Earlier this year, Maxwell offered $2 billion for Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc., a publishing, theme park and insurance concern,
but withdrew the offer after Harcourt undertook a $3 billion
recapitalization.
   Maxwell Communication still spent $1 billion making smaller
acquisitions in the United States this past year.

   General Motors Corp. and industry analysts credit
the automaker's 29 percent increase in its second-quarter earnings
to a return to profitability in its North American automaking
business and continued strong results overseas.
   GM barely broke even building cars and trucks in North America
in 1987, reaping $3.56 billion in 1987 profit from accounting
changes, tax benefits and record contributions from its streamlined
overseas businesses and its subsidiaries.
   But second-quarter revenue for the nation's biggest automaker
rose 12 percent to $29.9 billion from $26.7 billion a year ago,
breaking the previous quarterly record of $27.6 billion set in 1986
when the auto industry set a 16.3 million-vehicle annual sales
record.
   GM reported net earnings of $1.5 billion, or $4.52 a common
share, up from $1.17 billion, or $3.39 a common share, in the
second quarter a year ago.
   ``It was a good quarter. The number of units produced per
employee went up almost 17 percent versus second-quarter last year.
That's phenomenally good, showing the kind of earnings General
Motors can have if sales pick up,'' said Ronald Glantz, analyst
with Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   Car and light truck sales in 1988 have continued to surge well
ahead of pessimistic predictions issued in the wake of the October
1987 stock market crisis. Expectations for the year have risen to a
consensus of about 15.6 million vehicles, and GM has benefited from
the industry's surprisingly strong performance.
   ``Last year, (sales) volume was so low that most of their gains
came from accounting changes. This year, it seems based on volume.
Sales were strong in the first half, particularly in the second
quarter,'' said Kathleen Heaney, analyst with Nikko Securities
International in New York.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 12 percent from a year ago and broke
the previous GM record for any quarter of $27.6 billion set in
1986, GM said. The earnings were the best for any quarter since
second quarter 1984.
   GM also said that as of June 30, it had shaved $2.7 billion of
the $4 billion it plans to trim from its costs during 1988.
   In the second quarter, operating income rose 64 percent, to
$1.75 billion from $1.07 billion a year earlier. It rose 16 percent
in the first six months, to $2.4 billion from $2.08 billion a year
ago.
   GM said the improvement came both from a return to stronger
profitability in North America and overseas performance stronger
than last year's record. However, GM said it does not provide
income for different geographic areas on a quarterly basis.
   GM's worldwide vehicle sales rose 9.3 percent in the second
quarter, to 2.25 million.
   At the end of the second quarter, GM's North American-built cars
and light trucks held 35.1 percent of the U.S. market, up slightly
from 33.8 percent at the end of June 1987.
   In the first six months of 1988, GM earnings rose 13.3 percent
to $2.6 billion, or $7.63 a share, on revenue of $56.34 billion
from $2.29 billion, or $6.65 a share, on revenue of $52.8 billion a
year ago.
   On Wednesday, GM reported earnings by its three subsidiaries _
General Motors Acceptance Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp., and
GM Hughes Electronics Corp.
   GM blamed higher interest expenses and a drop in auto financings
for an 18.9 percent drop in GMAC earnings. Second-quarter earnings
for EDS and Hughes were up 33 percent and 16.4 percent,
respectively.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Moderate Late-Morning European Dealings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar held steady in moderate late-morning
trading in Europe today after rebounding slightly from lows hit
earlier in the session.
   Gold prices fell, and silver prices seesawed.
   Foreign exchange traders in Italy predicted the dollar would
remain weak.
   ``Things are pretty schizophrenic. Last week the dollar raced,''
one trader said. ``This week nobody seems to want it.''
   She said she expected the dollar to edge back up early next
week, where it could run into renewed central bank intervention.
   A trader in Milan said players were keeping a close eye on the
strong pound. But he said the pound possibly had reached the upper
end of its recent ascent, buoyed by a recent increase in British
interest rates.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7350, compared
with $1.7265 Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8268 West German marks, down from 1.8375; 1.5165
Swiss francs, down from 1.5275; 6.1620 French francs, down from
6.2000; 2.0600 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0765; 1,359.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,363.50; and 1.1958 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1968.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 1.42 yen to a closing 132.08. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 131.15 yen.
   Dealers said gold was sidelined this morning as silver's
volatile movements again dominated the market.
   Dealers said continued confusion about the state of a miners'
strike in Peru could send the metal in any direction.
   Silver bounced up to about $7.86 an ounce in Europe before
retreating to about $7.76.
   Later, silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $7.80 a
troy ounce, down from Thursday's $7.81.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $443 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $445.80. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$443.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $443.10, down from $445.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 43 cents to close at a bid
$444.86.

   Stock prices fell sharply Friday, weighed down by
declines on overseas markets and worries over interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was 14.8
points, or 0.8 percent, lower at 1,849.6 at midday. Trading volume
registered a light 233.1 million shares compared with 232.1 million
shares at the same time Thursday.
   Dealers said the market was depressed by declines on Wall Street
Thursday, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 24.01
points to 2,086.59 amid worries over rising interest rates and
disappointment with quarterly earnings reports.
   Declines earlier Friday in Tokyo, where the Nikkei index dropped
391.13 points to 27,285.01 also upset the market, dealers said.
   ``There are plenty of worries overhanging this market,'' one
equity salesman said, pointing to concerns over the near-term
direction of the dollar and crude oil prices. ``Until those
questions are resolved, we're likely to range trade for the time
being,'' he said.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Friday it is
cooperating with the U.S. attorney's office in a probe looking at
certain transactions completed by the investment firm's stock-loan
operation.
   Reading from a prepared statement, Shearson spokesman Michael
O'Neill said, ``We have not been advised of the nature of the
inquiry, but nothing in our discussion with the attorney's office
suggests that the firm or any of its employees are the target of an
investigation.''
   He confirmed that the firm had received subpoenas relating to
its stock-lending business, which is involved in lending and
borrowing large blocks of stocks to and from brokerages and
institutional clients.
   According to a report in Thursday editions of The Washington
Post, the focus of the investigation is Dennis Palmeri, who
supervises Shearson's stock-lending operation.
   The Post said the subpoenas seek information about transactions
conducted over the last few years that involved Palmeri, two of his
relatives and several of his business entities.
   The stock-lending business has been under investigation by
federal prosecutors for several years, the paper reported.
   Citing unidentified sources, the New York Times reported in
Friday editions that the inquiry is believed to encompass one or
more employees of Seemala Corp., a securities firm controlled by
convicted felon Ivan Boesky.

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices climbed a modest 0.3 percent
in June, with declines in gasoline and clothing costs nearly
offsetting a sharp increase in food prices, the government said
today.
   The overall June increase, which matched the rise for May, would
amount to an annual inflation rate of 4.2 percent if prices climbed
at the same pace for 12 straight months, the Labor Department said.
   Grocery store prices rose a sharp 0.7 percent, but there seemed
to be little effect from the summer's drought other than the huge
5.4 percent rise in poultry prices and the even steeper 6.6 percent
gain in egg costs.
   Cereal and bakery prices, not yet showing the full effects of
the drought, were up 0.4 percent.
   Grocery store prices, reflecting upward pressures before the
drought took hold, had risen 0.5 percent in May and 0.8 percent in
April.
   As for meat, analysts expect prices to fall later in the summer
as producers, facing staggering feed prices, sell off parts of
their herds. But Donald Ratajczak, an economist who conducts his
own price surveys from the Georgia State University in Atlanta,
said in advance of today's report that some retailers have not yet
passed their lower wholesale prices on to consumers.
   Indeed, pork prices rose 1.2 percent last month while beef
prices gained 1.3 percent.
   As for energy, gasoline costs, driven downward by worldwide
drops in crude oil prices, dipped a significant 0.9 percent after
rising 1.6 percent in May.
   Clothing prices fell 0.3 percent after rising a strong 3.8
percent through the first five months of 1988. Department analysts
attributed the decline to larger than usual markdowns in prices for
women's clothing.
   The 0.3 percent seasonally adjusted gain in the Consumer Price
Index left the annualized inflation rate for the first half of 1988
at 4.4 percent, the same as for all of 1987.
   The index itself stood at 118.0 in June, meaning that a
selection of goods costing $100 during a 1982-84 base period would
have cost $118 last month, 50 cents more than in the preceding
month and $4.50 more than a year ago.
   Excluding the effects of the volatile food and energy
categories, retail prices rose 0.4 percent in June, double May's
0.2 percent increase.
   The department gave these details of June's price changes:
   _Cooking oil prices were up 0.4 percent while dairy product
costs fell 0.2 percent. Prices of fruits and vegetables edged
downward 0.1 percent. Restaurant meal prices gained 0.4 percent.
Food prices, including meals eaten outside the home, rose 0.6
percent.
   _Energy prices overall were down 0.2 percent. Fuel oil prices
dropped 0.6 percent while natural gas and electricity costs gained
0.4 percent.
   _Prices for infants' and toddlers' clothing were off 1.0
percent, followed by a 0.8 percent drop in the costs of women's and
girls' clothing and a 0.1 percent dip in men's and boys' clothing.
   _Housing costs rose 0.3 percent, the same as in May and April.
   _Medical care expenses were up 0.4 percent, less than in recent
months but 6.4 percent greater than at this time last year.
   _New car prices rose 0.3 percent, faster than the 0.1 percent
gains of April and May.
   The government's monthly inflation reports are attracting
growing attention as the financial markets worry about the impact
of rising prices on the strength of the economy.
   Factories last month operated closer to capacity than at any
time in eight years, raising fears that strong demand will free
manufacturers to raise prices. Meanwhile, unemployment fell to 5.3
percent, a 14-year low, and heightened concern that workers will be
able to demand higher wages.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a
Washington-based consulting firm, said consumer resistance to
higher prices is discouraging inflation outside the food and energy
categories.
   ``Clients wring their hands and tear their hair. In many
industries _ restaurants, women's apparel, electronics _ you can
virtually only sell something if it's on sale,'' she said.
   Ratajczak warned that the long-term outlook for inflation is not
as good as over the next month or so. After meat prices fall
because of an increase in slaughtering, prices will go up and stay
up for at least a year in response to a shortage of animals.
   Also, the low unemployment rate will begin to be felt in an
increase in the price of services, he said.
   ``An upward tilt in inflation appears fairly inevitable,'' he
said. ``Next year could be a problem year, but it won't be
explosive.''

<HEAD>FDIC In Talks On Sale Of Its Continental Illinois Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is talking
with prospective buyers for the 70 percent stake in Continental
Illinois Corp. it acquired in bailing out the banking firm four
years ago, the agency's chairman said.
   While revealing the talks on the Continental Illinois shares, L.
William Seidman refused to say Thursday who has expressed an
interesting in purchasing the shares.
   He also said he couldn't predict when a sale might be completed.
   ``I'd love to come to a conclusion soon,'' he said after
speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the Chicago Association of
Commerce and Industry.
   ``We would be happy to talk to anybody who wants to acquire an
interest and who is a qualified buyer,'' he said.
   Seidman refused to say what price the FDIC would want for its
Continental shares, but said the ages stake at a ``reasonable''
price.
   Continental stock was up 37{ cents a share to $5.50 in early New
York Stock Exchange trading today.
   The FDIC sold about 10 percent of its Continental stock in
November 1986, receiving $5.25 a share.
   Continental nearly collapsed four years ago, but since its
bailout the bank's financial condition has improved and it is
restructuring its operations to concentrate on commercial banking.
   Seidman described Continental as ``a great bank with a strong
management and well-capitalized.''
   The FDIC is apparently seeking to reduce its investment in the
Chicago bank at a time when it is facing growing losses from bank
failures in Texas.
   Seidman said he expects the fund, which had a total net worth of
$18.3 billion at the end of 1987, to lose about 10 percent this
year as a result of payouts in bank failures and assistance to
threatened banks.
   This would be the first loss in the net worth of its deposit
insurance fund since the agency was founded in 1933.

   Stock prices fell today in a continuation of the
selling that has weighed down the market for most of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.95 points to
2,084.64 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the early
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 262 up, 630
down and 514 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.06 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its
performance the month before.
   That removed the threat of any unexpected sign of increased
inflationary pressure. Interest rates, which have been rising of
late, levelled off in the credit markets.
   But analysts said investors still were showing little enthusiasm
for stocks.
   Technology issues, which have been hit hard by some
disappointing earnings reports in recent sessions, remained under
pressure.
   Digital Equipment fell 1\ to 103]; Hewlett-Packard } to 50;
International Business Machines [ to 121|, and Sun Microsystems \

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost

index was down .60 at 307.60.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.01 to

   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 on the

   The dollar and stock prices declined sharply in
Tokyo today after steep falls in New York overnight.
   The dollar, which lost 2.20 yen in New York Thursday, declined
1.42 yen to finish the week at 132.08 yen in Tokyo.
   Traders said the U.S. currency stayed within a range of
131.63-132.20 yen in slow trading.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which soared 404.95 points on Thursday, retreated
391.13 points, or 1.41 percent, today to close at 27,285.01.
   It was the worst single-day decline in the Nikkei since Tuesday,
when the index plunged 513.03 points. In the previous worst
single-day loss, the Nikkei average lost 394.35 points on May 19.
   Volume traded on the market's first section was 1.7 billion
shares, compared to 1.8 billion the day before.
   A Bank of Japan official attributed the dollar's sharp decline
to ``the impact of cooperative intervention by central banks,''
according to Kyodo News Service.
   Tuesday's reported intervention by the Bank of Japan to stop the
fall of the West German mark was seen as a sign of determination by
central banks to stabilize exchange rates.
   Exchange dealers attributed the dollar's downturn in Tokyo
directly to the sharp overnight drop in New York.
   ``I don't see any outstanding factor in Tokyo which could bring
down the dollar,'' said a dealer at a major U.S. investment bank in
Tokyo.
   Other dealers said investment banks actively sold the dollar in
early morning trading following its decline in New York, causing
the dollar's fall.
   After opening at 131.85 yen, the U.S. currency regained the
132-yen level at late morning when news reports quoted Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as saying the yen's sudden appreciation
was not significant, dealers said.
   Brokers attributed the decline in share prices to a 24-point
fall in the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street overnight.
   ``The market as a whole is down but particular shares, mostly
large capital issues, have been barely holding the index up during
the past few weeks,'' said Keiichi Nishida of Kidder Peabody. ``So
when those large shares like steels, shipbuildings and electronics
fall, the Nikkei index plunges as if something very serious
happened.''
   Nishida said major Japanese securities companies, including
Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko Securities, were encouraging
investors to buy large capital issues to keep the market index up.
   ``The exchange's index does not necessarily reflect the real
market situation in Japan, unlike on Wall Street,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, workers at the Tokyo Stock Exchange went on an
hour-long strike this morning to protest the exchange's proposal to
extend dealing hours by half an hour.
   Trading was not affected by the strike, however, as managerial
workers filled in, dealers said.

   Crop futures opened mixed this morning as bearish
concerns about weekend showers in the thirsty Midwest offset
export-related buying, analysts said. Wheat and soybeans were
higher while corn was nearly unchanged.
   Although forecasters generally expected the weather in most
crop-growing states to turn warmer and drier over the weekend, some
predicted that scattered showers would sweep across the northern
Plains into the upper Midwest early next week.
   ``That's got everybody a little gun-shy because the last time we
were supposed to just get showers we got some good rains,'' said
John Frazier, grains analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   Despite the uncertainty about the weather, wheat prices rose on
the Agriculture Department's announcement of some new sales to
China, India and Iraq. Rumors that the Soviet Union was in the
market for soybean meal supported the soybean market, Frazier said.
   Corn opened lower on conjecture that recent rains had helped
some drought-stressed corn fields to recover, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 4\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.89 a bushel; corn was }
cent lower to { cent higher with September unchanged at $3.17 a
bushel; oats were 2 cents to 6 cents higher with September at
$2.69{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 7{ cents higher with
August at $8.49 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher and pork futures were sharply higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle .08 cent to .48 cent higher with August at 66.10
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .75 cent higher with
August at 76.85 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent to 1.28 cents
higher with August at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.30 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with July at 39.75 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futres settled sharply higher on Thursday.

<HEAD>Martin Marietta to Sell Interest in Hoskyns Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta Corp. said Friday it has
agreed to sell its 68.3 percent interest in Hoskyns Group PLC, a
London-based computer services company, to Plessey Co. PLC of Great
Britain for $190 million.
   The announcement came after Plessey announced earlier in London
it was offering to buy all of the Hoskyns shares.
   Martin Marietta said it had agreed to sell all of its shares in
Hoskyns to Plessey under terms of the agreement.
   The chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta, Norman R.
Augustine, said the proposed sale ``is perfectly timed to maximize
Martin Marietta's return on its investment in Hoskyns and is
consistent with our concentration on growth in our core data
systems businesses of integrating information management and
communication systems.''
   Hoskyns Group, one of Europe's leading computer services
companies, provides systems in the manufacturing, distribution,
retailing, services and financial markets.
   Founded in 1964, Hoskyns has been operated since 1975 as a
Martin Marietta subsidiary.
   Besides information systems, Bethesda-based Martin Marietta is
engaged in the design, manufacture and integration of systems and
products in space, defense, communications, energy and materials.
   Plessey is one of the United Kingdom's leading high-technology
companies with annual sales of about 1.3 billion pounds, which at
recent exchange rates would be equivalent to about $2.2 billion.

   Stock prices sustained another broad loss today
in a continuation of the selling that has weighed down the market
for most of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 42.86 points over
the week's first four sessions, dropped 23.47 to 2,063.12 by
noontime today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 308 up, 979
down and 497 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its
performance the month before.
   That removed the threat of any unexpected sign of increased
inflationary pressure. Interest rates, which have been rising of
late, levelled off in the credit markets.
   But analysts said investors still were showing little enthusiasm
for stocks.
   As the morning passed, brokers said prices of big-name issues
weakened when professionals engaged in computer program trading
sold those stocks as part of multiple strategies involving stock
index futures.
   Technology issues, which have been hit hard by some
disappointing earnings reports in recent sessions, remained under
pressure.
   Digital Equipment fell 2\ to 102]; Hewlett-Packard 1{ to 49\;
International Business Machines 1{ to 120\, and Ashton-Tate ~ to
21| in the over-the-counter market.
   Besides IBM, contributors to the Dow's decline included Philip
Morris, down 1} at 88; General Electric, down } at 41\; DuPont,
down 1 at 87, and McDonald's, down | at 43}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.66 to 149.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.60 at 306.60.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 82.44 million shares at
noontime, against 71.79 million at the same point Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Bull Inc. said Friday its board of
directors has picked a new chief executive, Roland D. Pampel, who
resigned as president of Apollo Computer Inc. on July 14.
   Pampel said at the time of his resignation from Apollo that he
was interested in being a chief executive at another company. His
announcement came after Apollo's surprise announcement that it
would lose money in the second quarter.
   Pampel, 53, succeeds Jerome J. Meyer, effective Monday. Meyer
will, as planned, rejoin Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis as president
of the Industrial Automation and Controls business, the company
said in a statement.
   In making the announcement, Jacques Stern, chairman of Honeywell
Bull and chairman and chief executive officer of Groupe Bull, said
Pampel was selected for the ``breadth of his management experience
in the computer industry and for his leadership in bringing
technologies to market, particularly in distributed systems and
networking.''
   Pampel began his career with International Business Machines
Corp., facility, where he managed the initial development of IBM's
Systems Network Architecture. He worked at Prime Computer Inc. and
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. before joining Apollo in 1986.
   Pampel became president and chief operating officer in July
1987. Apollo attributed its $8 million second-quarter loss to
customers' waiting for new products and the failure of its West
German subsidiary to achieve sales goals.
   Honeywell Bull was formed in March 1987 as a joint venture of
France's Compagnie des Machines Bull, Honeywell Inc. of the United
States and NEC Corp. of Japan.

   The new plane will be delivered in November 1989, with an option
for a second 767 to be delivered in August 1990.
   Air Zimbabwe will use the new jet to replace Boeing 707
equipment on its long-range routes, particularly into Europe,
Boeing said.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Earnings Rise 7 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Corp. said Friday its
second-quarter earnings rose 7 percent on the strong performance of
the company's natural resources segment.
   Union Pacific said it earned $153.6 million, or $1.35 a share,
up from $143.3 million, or $1.25 a share, in the second quarter of
1987.
   Revenue increased 8.8 percent to $1.61 billion from $1.48
billion a year earlier.
   The resources segment had a 25 percent earnings gain to $60
million. Higher volume and the settlement of several natural gas
contract disputes more than offset lower prices for energy, Union
Pacific said.
   Union Pacific Railroad's earnings rose 3 percent to $115
million. Income from the railroad's higher traffic volume was
offset by higher expenses for fuel and maintenance and increased
costs for personal injuries and litigation.
   During the second quarter Union Pacific completed its
acquisition of USPCI Inc. USPCI's income declined to $2 million
from $3.5 million because of the costs of its expansion plans.
   For the first half, the entire company earned $291.4 million, or
$2.56 a share, up 10 percent from $265.2 million, or $2.32 a share,
in the first six months of 1987.
   Revenue for the first half increased 9.3 percent to $3.17
billion from $2.9 billion in the year-earlier period.

<TEXT>
   After 50 years of building Carlson
Companies Inc. into the nation's 14th largest private company, the
richest man in Minnesota is patting his pockets and contemplating
the future of his empire.
   ``My biggest concern now is to make sure the earnings are there
so that it doesn't make bums out of my grandchildren,'' said Curt
Carlson, a 74-year-old entrepreneur who is in the process of
changing the guard at his $4 billion travel, restaurant, hotel and
business incentive company.
   The heir apparent to the sanctum that controls Radisson Hotels,
Ask Mr. Foster travel agencies, and TGI Friday's and Country
Kitchen restaurants is Edwin ``Skip'' Gage, who is married to
Carlson's daughter Barbara.
   The choice was between Gage, who is president and chief
operating officer, and Marilyn Nelson, Carlson's other daughter,
who serves on the board and is director of community affairs for
the company.
   ``The time will come when they'll be vying against each other,''
Carlson predicted.
   ``But I'm telling them, `Don't let the company come down to
nothing. Sell it before that happens.'''
   For Carlson, it's a problem he never dreamed of confronting when
he quit a comfortable sales job with Procter & Gamble Co. in 1938
to start the Gold Bond Stamp Co. in Minneapolis.
   Fifty years later, Carlson is celebrating his enormous success
by hosting a sit-down dinner Saturday for 4,000 people. He even
hired Bob Hope to entertain.
   The first banker he approached half a century ago called the
idea of selling trading stamps to grocery stores a ``damn fool
scheme,'' but it proved to be a stroke of genius that earned
Carlson his first million dollars by age 39.
   Since then he has accumulated a net worth of at least $640
million by building the trading stamp operation _ the first to go
nationwide _ into a conglomerate of 75 businesses employing more
than 50,000 people.
   ``I enjoy my status,'' Carlson said from his mansion on Lake
Minnetonka west of Minneapolis. ``I'm in with the crowd and I kind
of like that.''
   Impressive stuff for a former `C' student at the University of
Minnesota who came from ordinary means and worked his way through
school by delivering newspapers and driving a soda pop truck.
   Early in his career he shared the company 50-50 with a partner,
but Carlson bought him out because their work ethics clashed.
   ``Each year he'd say, `... let's not work this hard,''' Carlson
recalled. ``He liked to go to the club.''
   Arleen Carlson said her husband of 50 years has been considering
retiring for the past 10 to 15 years. He hasn't because he loves to
work, she said.
   ``It's his brainchild,'' Mrs. Carlson said of the company.
``He's a leader and it's difficult to make the break.''
   But Carlson said he is finally prepared to step down as chief
executive officer to become a long-range strategic adviser.
   ``I'm not going to be the kind of chairman who still stays in
there and runs it,'' he said.
   That's hard to believe from a man who has been known to call his
grandchildren on Sundays when he's out of town to make sure they've
gone to church. Carlson is still the undisputed leader of the
company and his decisions are final.
   For example, an executive of the company recently approached him
about going into the gaming business with one of the company's
hotels.
   ``As long as I'm alive there'll never be any gaming,'' said
Carlson, who said he once sat on the board of directors of a
company that lost money in an apparent skimming operation at a Las
Vegas hotel.
   What Carlson said he dreads most about the future is the
inevitable family friction that will follow his death. It's not his
two daughters and seven grandchildren he worries about, it's the
descendants who haven't been born yet.
   ``I haven't been able to influence them,'' he said.
   So Carlson wants to forestall as long as possible the era of a
rich and idle Carlson clan by keeping family members employed. But
to land a job at the company, they'll be required to work for at
least three years on the outside.
   ``I think you have to be gainfully employed to be really
happy,'' he said.
   Gainful employment in Carlson's company means working at least
six days a week if you want to climb the ladder, said Dick Adrian,
a former Carlson Companies vice president who quit in 1982 after
seeing many a middle manager depart for jobs with equal pay and
fewer demands at other companies.
   ``He doesn't pay any more than he has to,'' Adrian said. ``And
at Curt's establishment it's business first, everything else
second.''
   But Adrian said most Carlson alumni respect the founder for his
drive and business cunning. Even though Carlson considers himself
an entrepreneur, he managed the company tightly and as recently as
the late 1970s demanded to make the final decision on any expense
larger than $50,000, Adrian said.
   ``It's amazing how much he knew about all the divisions,''
Adrian said. ``He and Skip have a real close relationship with the
numbers in all those divisions.''
   Adrian said he once saw Carlson ``pacing and yelling'' after
being notified that one of his aquisitions contained a surprise
liability.
   ``I'm not exactly positive, but I think they went back to check
the structure of the ceiling in his office,'' Adrian said.
   Gage said his father-in-law is an expert deal maker. When
trading stamps faded in 1968, Carlson went on a diversification
binge by adding to his acquisition of the Radisson Hotel in
Minneapolis with investments in business incentive companies,
travel agencies, more hotels, other real estate and restaurants.
   The largest profit center in the conglomerate, Carlson said, is
E.F. MacDonald Motivation Co., an incentive company he purchased in
1981 that counts General Motors, Goodrich Tires, and Chrysler Corp.
as its customers.
   Although he is not well known nationally, Carlson is a legend in
Minnesota and a dignitary in Sweden, where his grandfather was a
farmer. Carlson and his wife are friends with the king and queen of
Sweden and Carlson was named Swedish-American of the year in
Stockholm in 1981.
   Among his celebrated causes in Minnesota, Carlson was one of
seven businessmen who put up a total of $10 million to help develop
the Metrodome. He also contributed $400,000 to the 1984 buyout of
Twins tickets that kept former owner Calvin Griffith from moving
the team to Florida. In 1986, Carlson put up $25 million for the
University of Minnesota to spark a fund drive that raised $350
million.
   ``He lives his commitments,'' said Carl Platou, president of
Fairview Hospitals and Health Systems, where Carlson has been a
board member for 25 years.
   ``He helps people understand what the future is going to be.''

   Prices fell sharply Friday on the London Stock
Exchange, finishing at the day's lows amid concerns about the
pound's strength and a decline in prices in the U.S. stock market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 19.6
points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,844.8, the day's low.
   Trading activity remained focused in a few shares affected by
takeover speculation or special situations, and the market's
overall trading volume remained low.
   Volume was a moderate 366.4 million shares, down from 402.6
million shares a day earlier.
   Analysts said the market remained weighed down by the pound's
continued strength against the West German mark, which affects the
export competitiveness of Britain's major exporting companies.
   A drop in prices on Wall Street before the London market's close
also helped to undermine confidence, pushing share prices down to
the day's lows, dealers said.

   Armtek Corp. reported Friday its
earnings soared 81 percent in the company's third quarter due
largely to the sale of its Armstrong Rubber Co. subsidiary.
   For the third quarter, which ended June 30, Armtek's net income
was $15 million, or $1.25 a share, compared with earnings of $6.7
million, or 58 cents a share, for the same quarter in 1987.
   Armtek sold Armstrong Rubber to Pirelli Group on May 31. That
sale and the disposition of other assets accounted for 57 cents a
share in the third quarter earnings, Armtek said.
   Armtek said sales for its three continuing businesses totaled
$238.3 million in the third quarter, up 15 percent from $206.5
million in the same period last year.
   Armtek's three remaining operating companies, Blackstone Corp.,
Copolymer Rubber & Chemical Corp. and Dayco Products Inc., produce
engineered drive systems, heat exchange components and systems, and
speciality polymers.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Armtek earned $27
million, or $2.30 a share, double the $13.5 million, or $1.21 a
share, it earned in the same period a year earlier.
   Armtek has 21 plants in the United States, nine in Europe and a
joint venture in South Korea.

<HEAD>Eastern Announces Plan To Cut 4,000 Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines said today it will eliminate
4,000 jobs and cut service to 14 cities on Aug. 31 and leave its
Western hub in a cost-cutting move one union immediately called a
``slap in the face.''
   ``We are preserving the airline. We're strengthening the
airline. I don't care to place the blame anywhere,'' Eastern
president Phil Bakes said, citing high operating costs and
competition for a $182 million loss in 1987.
   Personnel cuts through layoff and early retirement will affect
union and non-union employees and management, Bakes said. They will
include some 520 jobs in Miami, 300 in Atlanta and 350 in Kansas
City, Mo., which no longer will be the carrier's Western hub.
   Eastern's operations in Boston, New York, Washington, Atlanta
and Miami will be the core of the carrier's service, he said.
   The 12 percent reduction in workforce will free a proportional
percentage Eastern's fleet, which will be sold, he said.
   Eastern said service will be suspended in the following cities
beginning Aug. 31: Albuquerque, N.M.; Fort de France, Martinique;
Las Vegas, Nev.; Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn.; Oklahoma City, Okla.;
Omaha, Neb.; Dallas; Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe; Reno-Lake Tahoe,
Nev.; San Antonio, Texas; San Diego, Calif.; St. Lucia, West
Indies; Tuscon, Ariz.; and Tulsa, Okla.
   Eastern is locked in bitter contract talks with its machinists
union. The union is seeking raises for the 10,000 workers it
represents, while the carrier is pressing for $161 million in such
cost concessions as pay cuts.
   The carrier seeks another $69 million in concessions from its
pilots union, which began formal contract talks with the company
Friday.
   ``We feel this is a very cavalier action by Texas Air and a real
slap in the face to the loyal Eastern employees of Kansas City, who
made the hub a success,'' said Ron Cole, spokesman for the Air Line
Pilot's Association.
   The unions contend that Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp. is
trying to dismantle Eastern, selling off profitable assets and then
folding it into a sister subsidiary. Since Texas Air bought Eastern
for $676 million in November 1986, a sale the carriers' three major
unions unsuccessfully tried to block in court, Eastern has been
trimmed considerably.
   Eastern's parent firm Texas Air ended last year $466 million in
the red.
   Miami civic and business leaders are lobbying for federal
mediators to declare an impasse in the 7-month-old talks with
machinists. An impasse would trigger a 30-day ``cooling off''
period under federal law. The union would be free after that to
strike and the company to impose its latest proposal.
   The IAM is seeking a two-year contract with raises of 1.5
percent and 5 percent, which Eastern says will cost $50 million
yearly.

<HEAD>McGraw-Hill Likely To Pinpoint Questionable Stock Trades, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McGraw-Hill Inc. has a good chance of tracking
down the culprit if someone leaked advance information on stocks
spotlighted in its widely read Business Week magazine, experts said
Friday.
   The publisher said Thursday that its legal counsel is
investigating suspicious price movements and heavy trading in
stocks mentioned in the ``Inside Wall Street'' column before
Business Week was available to the public.
   While the investigation encompasses McGraw-Hill's entire
operation _ from its in-house staff to the four plants where
Business Week is printed _ the experts expressed doubt the
magazine's editorial staff was involved.
   Most agreed the conviction of a Wall Street Journal reporter who
leaked advance information to a stockbroker would deter journalists
from making a similar error in judgment.
   In 1985, reporter R. Foster Winans was convicted of passing tips
about items scheduled to appear in the financial newspaper's
influential ``Heard on the Street'' column. He was sentenced to 18
months in prison.
   ``You would think the Winans case would scare (editorial)
people,'' said Ralph Ferrara, former general counsel of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and a partner of the New York
law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton.
   The Winans case was far simpler to investigate, because that
column was written by only two reporters, handled by a few editors
and printed immediately, the experts said. They said extensive
legwork would be required to follow Business Week's publication
trail.
   The magazine's 960,000 weekly issues are printed early Thursday
morning, released to the press after the market closes that day and
to the general public on Friday.
   In order to trace the leak, McGraw-Hill is likely to team up
with the enforcement operations of stock exchanges and ultimately,
the SEC.
   That way ``McGraw-Hill can get the names of the purchasers and
sellers of the stocks and match them with the files of their
employees,'' Ferrara said.
   If the leak occurred at one of the plants, which are located in
Connecticut, California, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and do contract
work for McGraw-Hill, it would be more difficult to track but still
possible, the experts said.
   James Ratcliffe, director of public affairs at R.R. Donnelley &
Sons Inc., which prints Business Week in Connecticut and
California, said the company had launched its own investigation
separate from McGraw-Hill's inquiry.
   He said that while only about 150 employees work the night shift
when Business Week is printed in Connecticut, ``almost anybody at
the plant could lay their hands on it.'' The plant employs 550
people.
   Sam Scott Miller, a partner in the New York firm Orrick,
Herrington & Sutcliffe and a member of the Securities Industry
Association's trading practices committee, said, ``It's certainly
easier to connect up with a printer who's doing it in his own name,
and it's not too much more difficult to find someone who's
brother-in-law or cousin'' is trading on the information.
   It is difficult to finger someone with no business or social
connection to the information, but ``it's definitely still
possible,'' Scott said.
   ``These people don't just pop up out of the blue,'' he said,
adding that the first thing investigators do is make geographical
connections among the trades.
   Once a pattern is nailed down, authorities begin questioning
individuals.
   ``The SEC and the stock exchanges have proven to be
extraordinarily resourceful in networking these deals,'' Ferrara
said. ``With a little information from personnel files, you'll be
surprised how bells and whistles start to engage.''
   There have been a number of cases involving printers who traded
on information taken from financial documents, lawyers said. But
one problem is that a case is nearly impossible to build unless the
employer has a policy specifically restricting such activity.
   Donnelley's Ratcliffe said all employees are made aware that
they are handling highly confidential information and any misuse
will result in disciplinary action. To date he said there have been
no firings for that reason.
   A spokesman for W.A. Kreuger Co., which prints Business Week at
a plant in Wisconsin, was said to be out of his office and
unreachable for comment.

   Stock prices slumped again today in a
continuation of the selling that has weighed down the market for
most of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 42.86 points over
the week's first four sessions, dropped 17.60 to 2,068.99 by 3 p.m.
today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 357 up, 1,065 down
and 477 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its
performance the month before.
   That removed the threat of any unexpected sign of increased
inflationary pressure. Interest rates, which have been rising of
late, levelled off in the credit markets.
   But analysts said investors still were showing little enthusiasm
for stocks.
   Just before midsession, brokers said prices of big-name issues
weakened when professionals engaged in computer program trading
sold those stocks as part of multiple strategies involving stock
index futures.
   Technology issues, which have been hit hard by some
disappointing earnings reports in recent sessions, remained under
pressure.
   Digital Equipment fell 1[ to 103{; Hewlett-Packard 1 to 49};
International Business Machines 1 to 120\, and Ashton-Tate { to 22
in the over-the-counter market.
   Besides IBM, contributors to the Dow's decline included Philip
Morris, down 1 at 88}; General Electric, down } at 41\; DuPont,
down 1~ at 86[, and Eastman Kodak, down ] at 42.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.30 to 149.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.15 at 306.05.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 128.49 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Crop futures closed mostly lower Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a lackluster session marked by
uncertainty about the Farm Belt weather outlook for the weekend and
beyond.
   Grain and soybean prices had fallen sharply earlier in the week
as showers swept across the dusty Midwest and the market has been
unable to sustain a rally since then because of speculation that
the drought pattern has weakened, analysts said.
   ``The bulls are really grasping here, trying to get things
recovered,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``What we need (to make prices rise) is a
return to hot, dry weather.''
   Forecasters generally expected temperatures in the Midwest to
turn warmer over the weekend but some also predicted scattered
showers, and traders were hesitant to establish new positions.
   ``Everybody's a little gun-shy because the last time we were
supposed to just get showers we got some good rains,'' said John
Frazier, grain specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.84{ a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 5 cents lower with September at $3.12 a bushel; corn was
9{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with September at $2.60 a bushel;
soybeans were 10{ cents lower to 20 cents higher with August at
$8.32 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Honda announced Friday a voluntary recall
of 279,821 of its 1984 and 1985 model Civic cars because of a
design flaw that could cause fuel leaks and what the company called
a small possibility of fire.
   Owners of the cars subject to the leak in the mechanical fuel
pump will be notified and the fuel pump replaced free of charge,
American Honda Motor Co. Inc. announced from its headquarters here.
The company said it hadn't had any reports of injuries caused by
the defect.
   The defect affects cars with carburetors and mechanical fuel
pumps. A crimped seam between the fuel pump halves can, after a
period of being subject to internal pressure and engine
temperature, begin to leak, the company said.

Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc., citing the strongest semiconductor
market growth in four years, Friday announced a profit of $92
million for the second quarter, an increase of 39 percent over
earnings of $66 million for the same period in 1987.
   The strong quarter lifted earnings of the Dallas-based company
for the first half of the year to $177 million, compared with $156
million for the first six months of 1987.
   Earnings per common share for the second quarter were $1.02,
compared with 78 cents in 1987. That increased earnings per common
share to $1.97 for the first half of 1988 from $1.90 last year.
   Revenue for the quarter that ended June 30, measured as net
sales billed, climbed to $1.56 billion from $1.37 billion, said the
company, whose products include semiconductors, computer systems
and defense electronics systems.
   For the first six months of the year, revenue rose to $3.03
billion from $2.64 billion.
   Jerry R. Junkins, the chief executive, said an expanding U.S.
economy coupled with strong industrial markets in the Asia-Pacific
and European regions resulted in double-digit growth in electronic
equipment shipments.
   Net sales billed in semiconductors reached an all-time high in
the second quarter through a combination of greater production and
higher prices, the company said.

<HEAD>Irving Urges End To Hostile Takeover Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. on Friday urged Bank of New
York Co. to abandon its protracted takeover attempt, saying the
battle was ``effectively at an end'' since the hostile suitor gave
no indication that it planned to wage another proxy battle.
   But Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said the company had
no intention of ending its merger plans, which began last
September. He said Bank of New York could, based on a court ruling,
seek another proxy vote on its nominees to Irving's board of
directors.
   ``We have no present intention of waging another proxy battle
... but we're not going to reveal our business strategies,'' he
said.
   The New York Supreme Court, overturning the result of a previous
proxy vote, recently ruled that holders of 10 percent of Irving's
stock had the right to call special meetings. However, the court
confirmed the re-election of Irving's board of directors, which had
been contested by Bank of New York.
   The state court also struck down a provision of Irving's
anti-takeover ``poison pill,'' intended to make unsolicited
takeover bids prohibitively expensive, although Irving has appealed
that ruling.
   The provision would have allowed all shareholders, except a
hostile acquirer, to buy $400 worth of Irving shares for $200 if
any suitor bought more than 20 percent of Irving stock without the
support of Irving's management.
   ``With this favorable court ruling (regarding the board's
re-election) ... we believe that this hostile takeover attempt is
effectively at an end,'' Irving said in a statment. ``... We urge
Bank of New York's board to step in and direct its management to
cease its hostile activities, which have been disruptive and costly
to both banking companies.''
   Irving's board favors a friendly merger with the state-run Banca
Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second largest bank.
   Banca Commerciale offered $80 a share for 51 percent of Irving's
18.5 million common shares outstanding, plus warrants entitling
shareholders to buy newly issued Irving stock at $65 a share over
the next seven years. Stockholders would receive one warrant for
every four shares they currently owned. The blended value was as
much as $76.50 per share.
   The merger proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring
plan that includes, among other things, sale of Irving assets,
cost-cutting measures and a special cash dividend.
   Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of
Irving's common shares outstanding. The offer is valued at around
$68 a share or $1.2 billion.
   Bank of New York and many private banking analysts have
maintained that Bank of New York's hostile offer was superior to
that of Banca Commerciale largely because the New York bank already
had received conditional regulatory approval. That approval expires
Sept. 7.
   The takeover battle has attracted widespread interest in the
banking industry because hostile bank takeover efforts are
relatively rare.

   Allegheny International Inc. said Thursday it
will move Sunbeam's headquarters from the Chicago area to the
offices of its Oster appliance unit in Milwaukee, where office rent
is cheaper.
   ``Some jobs will be eliminated'' in the Chicago suburb of
Downers Grove, Ill., where Sunbeam is based, said Edward M.
Romanoff, spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based parent.
   He said it was not immediately clear how many of the 150
employees at Downers Grove will lose their jobs as the move occurs
over the next several months. The Sunbeam headquarters probably
will be reduced to a small office with about 10 employees.
   About 300 people work at Oster headquarters in Milwaukee.
   Allegheny International last month announced the formation of
Oster-Sunbeam Appliance Co. in a consolidation of its two small
appliance subsidiaries, he said. Oster-Sunbeam is a division of
Allegheny International's Sunbeam Corp. subsidiary.
   The move will not affect Sunbeam Corp.'s other divisions,
including the outdoor furniture manufacturer Almet-Lawnlite in
Portland, Tenn., the electric blanket and heating pad maker
Northern Electric Co. in Chicago, and the barbeque grill maker
Sunbeam Leisure Products Co. in Neosho, Mo.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. said its second-quarter
earnings rose more than 14 percent as the broadcast and publishing
company benefitted from lower tax rates.
   Capital Cities-ABC said it earned $113.9 million, or $6.78 a
share, up from $99.7 million, or $5.88 a share, in the same period
of 1987.
   Revenue increased during the quarter to $1.16 billion from $1.13
billion in the second three months of last year.
   The company said weakness in the national advertising market led
to only modest growth in broadcasting and publishing revenue.
   It said the increase in second-quarter earnings was attributable
primarily to lower income tax rates.
   For the first half, Capital Cities-ABC said it earned $184.2
million, or $10.93 a share, up nearly 49 percent from $123.7
million, or $7.35 a share, for the first six months of 1987.
   First-half revenue increased to $2.45 billion from $2.09 billion.
   Capital Cities-ABC operates ABC's television and radio networks
and stations, 21 other radio stations and provides cable television
programming. It also publishes nine daily newspapers, weekly
newpapers and other publications and distributes information from
electronic databases.

   The dollar lost more ground Friday against
nearly all major currencies, while the strong British pound
continued to take the spotlight in worldwide trading.
   Gold prices rose after falling overseas. Republic National Bank
of New York quoted a late bid of $442 for a troy ounce of gold, up
50 cents from Thursday.
   Robert Ryan, senior currency trader for Irving Trust Co., said
sentiment toward the dollar remained bearish following recent
central-bank intervention intended to thwart the dollar's previous
rise.
   He attributed the dollar's decline in domestic trading Friday
mainly to technical factors.
   Overseas, currency dealers said the market remained confused
about the near-term outlook for the dollar, with one British trader
calling the rapid changes in sentiment toward the U.S. currency
``scary.''
   ``People are stung and confused,'' he said.
   A dealer at a European bank in Frankfurt said he expected the
dollar's slide to bottom out at current levels, but added that the
market was hard to gauge. ``There was absolutely no trend,'' he
said of Friday's trading.
   Meanwhile, the British pound continued to rise, bolstered by
Britain's strong economy and prospects for higher interest rates
there.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7405, compared
with $1.7265 Thursday. Sterling fetched $1.74225 in New York, up
from $1.7280.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 1.42 yen to a closing 132.08 yen. It fell in London
to 130.58 yen. Later, in New York, the dollar stood at 130.84 yen,
down from 131.575 yen late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.82775 West German marks, down from
1.8375; 1.5180 Swiss francs, down from 1.5278; 1.2009 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1979; 6.1665 French francs, down from 6.1980;
and 1,352.55 Italian lire, down from 1,360.125.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday: 1.8265
West German marks, down from 1.8375; 1.5175 Swiss francs, down from
1.5275; 6.1630 French francs, down from 6.2000; 2.0615 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.0765; 1.1983 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1968; and 1,353.75 Italian lire, down from 1,363.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $442.20 a troy ounce from $441.80 late Thursday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $442.00 an ounce, compared
with late Thursday's $445.80. In Zurich, the bid was $442.50 an
ounce, down from $445.50 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 43 cents to close at a bid
$444.86 an ounce.
   Silver prices were lower. Silver bullion for current delivery
fell on the New York Comex, to $7.606 a troy ounce from $7.737 late
Thursday.
   Silver fell on the London market to a late bid of $7.76 a troy
ounce, compared with Thursday's $7.81.

<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp. has made three key managerial
changes in an effort to strengthen the fast-food chain's top
management, company president Charles S. Olcott announced Friday.
   Olcott, president and chief operating officer of Burger King
Corp., said in a release Friday that the changes are effective
immediately.
   The nation's second-biggest fast food chain, behind industry
leader McDonald's Corp., Burger King has reported sluggish sales
growth over the past two years.
   Ronald Petty, 44, president of Burger King International, has
been named president of Burger King USA. Petty joined Burger King
operations in 1978 as vice president of real estate.
   Richard Snead, 36, executive vice president for development and
for the North Central Division, has been named president of Burger
King International. Snead joined Burger King in 1978 as a senior
site engineer for the San Francisco region.
   Kevin Moriarty, 40, region vice president and general manager of
the Chicago region, has been named executive vice president and
division manager for the North Central Division, with
responsibility for the Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis regions. He
joined Burger King in 1974 as an assistant restaurant manager in
Long Island.
   ``The promotion of these three veteran Burger King Corporation
leaders will further strengthen our top management group and better
enable us to provide increased service to our customers and
franchisees as we move into the new fiscal year,'' said Olcott.
   Burger King Corp. and its franchisees operate more than 5,500
restaurants worldwide. A wholly-owned subsidiary of The Pillsbury
Co., Burger King Corp. and its franchises have systemwide sales in
excess of $5 billion.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discovering more competition than
expected, American Airlines told the State Department it will not
accept the authorization to fly between West Berlin and three
cities in West Germany.
   Officials at the airline made the notification Thursday because
of the ``excessive capacity levels authorized on these routes.''
Making a profit woul be almost impossible, American said.
   The airline was surprised that the three nations that govern
West Berlin _ the United States, France and Britain _ had granted
as much new service to the city as they did last month, American
spokesman Steve McGregor said.
   ``We've run the numbers several times over the last few weeks,
and they just don't work for us, in either a short- or a long-term
sense,'' he said. ``And this airline is just not prepared to enter
into any markets where we know we would have to lose money for a
long, long time.''
   American petitioned the three nations late last year for
permission to build a connecting hub complex in West Berlin.
   The airline's plan was to serve Hamburg, Dusseldorf,
Cologne-Bonn, Frankfurt and Munich in West Germany; Zurich,
Switzerland; and Vienna, Austria, from West Berlin. Three other
U.S. airlines followed with similar plans for West Berlin service.
   American pulled back after learning that the three nations
authorized nearly twice as many new flights between West Berlin and
cities in the West as there had been previously.
   American had been awarded four daily round trips to Frankfurt,
three to Munich and three to Cologne-Bonn. Trans World Airlines was
given four daily round trips to Frankfurt, two to Hamburg and two
to Stuttgart, West Germany.
   Pan American World Airways, which had been the only U.S. carrier
serving West Berlin, was granted three more round trips daily to
Dusseldorf.
   British Airways PLC, which already serves West Berlin, was given
28 new round trips a week between West Berlin and Frankfurt and a
total of 56 new flights each week to points in the West.
   Also, a new airline to be formed as a joint venture between Air
France, which already serves West Berlin, and West Germany's
Lufthansa was given 36 round trips a week to Frankfurt, 19 to
Cologne-Bonn, 25 to Munich and 25 to Stuttgart.
   The three countries created rights to 120 new round trips
between West Berlin and Frankfurt alone, in hopes of stimulating
price and service competition on what previously had been a tightly
protected and high-cost route.
   McGregor said four McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airplanes that
American would have used for West Berlin service will now be
employed on domestic routes.

<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. said Friday its
second-quarter earnings climbed 26 percent as its sales rose 17.7
percent from a year ago.
   The world's cereal-maker said its profit rose to $112.7 million,
or 92 cents a share, for the three months ending June 30, from
$89.8 million or 72 cents a share for the second quarter of 1987.
   April-through-June sales rose to $1.09 billion from $920.7
million in the year-earlier period.
   Earnings for the period benefited both from the increased cereal
sales and from the lowered U.S. statutory income tax rate, the
company said.
   For the first six months of the year, Kellogg reported net
earnings of $233.8 million, or $1.90 a share on sales of $2.12

   The stock market closed out its worst week in
more than three months with another broad decline in relatively
quiet trading Friday.
   Some seemingly favorable news on inflation and a modest decline
in interest rates failed to stir the market out of its recent slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 25.60 to 2,060.99,
stretching its loss for the week to 68.46 points.
   That marked the biggest weekly decline for the average since it
dropped 76.26 points April 11-15.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
406 up, 1,079 down and 457 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 148.88 million
shares, against 149.46 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 170.88 million shares.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in June, matching its
performance the month before.
   That removed the threat of any unexpected sign of increased
inflationary pressure. Interest rates, which have been rising of
late, turned downward in the credit markets.
   But analysts said investors still were showing little enthusiasm
for stocks.
   Just before midsession, brokers said prices of big-name issues
weakened when professionals engaged in computer program trading
sold those stocks as part of multiple strategies involving stock
index futures.
   Technology issues, which have been hit hard by some
disappointing earnings reports in recent sessions, continued to
slump.
   Control Data lost 1| to 22. The company announced plans to close
five plants for a week in August, citing disappointing computer
sales.
   Tandem Computers dropped ~ to 13} on top of a 2}-point slide
Thursday, when the company posted lower quarterly profits.
   Digital Equipment fell 1] to 103\; Hewlett-Packard 1[ to 49|;
International Business Machines 1| to 120[, and Ashton-Tate { to 22
in the over-the-counter market.
   Besides IBM, contributors to the Dow's decline included Philip
Morris, down 1{ at 88\; General Electric, down } at 41\; DuPont,
down 2{ at 85{, and Eastman Kodak, down ] at 42.
   Polaroid, subject of a $40-a-share takeover bid by Shamrock
Holdings, rose ~ to 40} on speculation that another suitor might
appear.
   Technical Tape, traded on the American Stock Exchange, jumped 3
to 13{. The company agreed to a $13.75-a-share takeover by
Dainippon Ink & Chemicals.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $26.53 billion, or 0.99
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.35 to 149.55.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 3.64 to 304.36, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.16 at 263.50.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.51 to 387.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 306.11, down 2.097

   Polaroid Corp.'s stock jumped in heavy trading
Friday amid speculation that a ``white knight'' may emerge to
compete with a bid that values the instant camera company at more
than $2 billion.
   Polaroid rose 87{ cents a share to finish at $40.75 in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading, which was slightly above the
$40-a-share Roy E. Disney offered on Wednesday through Shamrock
Holdings Inc.
   Nearly 2.6 million shares traded hands, more than three times
Polaroid's normal daily volume.
   Polaroid, which jumped $7.75 on the week, has hinted that it
would reject the bid from Disney, nephew of the late Walt Disney.
The company said it had no comment on Friday's stock movement.
   Among a number of rumors circulating in the finanical markets
were hints that Goldman, Sachs & Co. had placed Polaroid on its
restricted list, indicating it might be representing a bidder for
the Cambridge, Mass.-based company.
   A Goldman spokesman could not confirm or deny the rumor, but
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst Eugene Glazer said Goldman
typically did not represent unwanted suitors. ``By that firm's
nature they would not represent a hostile bidder,'' he said.
   It also was rumored that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had agreed
to finance Shamrock's bid.
   Among the speculative list of potential ``white knights'' is
Fuji Photo Film Co. of Tokyo, said B. Alex Henderson, a vice
president and senior securities analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Among other companies that might be interested in Polaroid from
a strictly financial perspective were a handful of Japanese
consumer electronics companies, including Sony Corp., Toshiba Corp.
and Hitachi Ltd., analysts said.
   Henderson noted that imaging ``is a very hot area right now, and
current developments in the computer arena make imaging-related
products much more important to the mainstream computing world.''
   Shamrock's offer values Polaroid at about $2.88 billion based on
71.9 million shares outstanding. But Shamrock has indicated it
might not proceed unless it manages to get the recent issue of 10
million shares rescinded. That would lower the value of the bid to
$2.48 billion.
   Polaroid unveiled a retrenchment plan earlier this month calling
for layoffs and cost-cutting.
   After Disney unveiled his proposal, Polaroid management issued a
statement reiterating its support for the restructuring. ``We
firmly believe that this is, without doubt, the right course for
Polaroid and for all of its shareholders, employees, customers and
communities,'' it said.
   Henderson said the plan gives ``a strong indication ... that
they are going to protect themselves.''

   If you mean Newark, N.J., why say Pittsburgh?
asks the Better Business Bureau of New York.
   Because Pittsburgh isn't the issue, says Continental Airlines.
   Confused?
   So are many readers of a Continental advertisement that appears
to suggest the airline can get you to Pittsburgh from Manhattan's
Penn Station in 42 minutes, says the Better Business Bureau of
Metropolitan New York.
   The BBB said Friday that the ad is deceptive and should be
discontinued.
   But the airline defended the ad as being no more dishonest than
ads featuring raisins that sing or cats that talk and said it would
continue to appear in local newspapers.
   ``Advertising hyperbole is a well-established, longstanding,
absolutely straightforward methodology to inform readers, viewers,
listeners. That's exactly what this ad does,'' Bruce Hicks, a
Continental spokesman, said from the company headquarters in
Houston.
   In a bold headline the ad promises: ``Penn Station to
Pittsburgh. 42 min.''
   Following the headline, in much smaller type, the ad explains
that 42 minutes is the average travel time from Penn Station to
Newark Airport during rush hours.
   ``The issue isn't Pittsburgh,'' Hicks said, ``it's how close
Newark Airport is to much of Manhattan.''
   Still, the BBB's president, Barbara Berger Opotowsky, is not
mollified and said the ad ``creates a misconception to the reader''
and ``an impression with no basis in reality.''
   Ms. Opotowsky said she has referred the matter to the state
attorney general and New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs.
   So, how long does it take to get to Pittsburgh from Penn Station?
   Assuming that after 42 minutes travel time you arrive at the
Newark terminal 30 minutes before the 8:40 a.m. flight, the entire
journey should take you 171 minutes.

   Holiday Corp. said Thursday its
second-quarter profit rose 33 percent despite a 3 percent decline
in revenue.
   The lodging and gaming company said its earnings rose to $99.8
million, or $4 a share, for the three months ended July 1 compared
with a profit of $74.9 million, or $3.12 a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue slipped to $410.4 million from $423.3
million a year earlier.
   The company said operating income for its gaming operations
increased 31.8 percent, largely because of a 73.2 percent
improvement in operating income at Harrah's Marina In Atlantic City.
   Operating income for hotels declined by 7.7 percent due to the
sale of 40 hotels over the past year, the company said.
   The company said results for the quarter reflected gains of
$154.1 million on the sale of 23 hotels and other assets. The
results also included an extraordinary charge of $6 million
associated with early retirement of debt.
   The company reported a total debt at the end of the quarter of
$2.2 billion, compared with $2.8 billion at the end of the same
period last year.
   For the first six months, Holiday said its earnings fell 27
percent to $81.1 million, or $3.26 a share, from $111.4 million, or
$4.65 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenues for the first half fell 1.9 percent to $806.7 million
from $822.7 million a year earlier.
   The results included a charge of $24.8 million for early debt
retirement in the latest quarter, compared with a charge of $3.5
million a year earlier.
   Holiday Corp. is the parent company of Holiday Inn, Embassy
Suites, Hampton Inn, Homewood Suites and Harrah's.

   Knight-Ridder Inc. said Friday its second-quarter
profit rose 4.7 percent as a lower tax rate helped offset a weak
advertising market and higher newsprint prices.
   The media concern said it earned $45 million, or 78 cents a
share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $43
million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Operating revenue rose 3.4 percent to $544.6 million from $526.9
million in the second quarter of 1987.
   But operating income slipped 9.9 percent to $79.3 million for
the quarter from $88.1 million a year earlier.
   ``Weak retail and general advertising revenues, high newsprint
prices in our newspaper division and soft national television
advertising revenues contributed to a drop in operating profit,''
said Knight-Ridder's chief financial officer, Robert Singleton.
   ``But the benefits of a tax cut and other non-operating items,
including the purchase of over 2 million shares of our stock in the
past 12 months, resulted in gains in net income and earnings per
share,'' Singleton said.
   For the first six months of 1988, Knight-Ridder posted a profit
of $78.8 million, or $1.37 a share, up 10.1 percent from $71.6
million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month operating revenue rose 3.9 percent to $1.06 billion
from $1.02 billion a year earlier.
   Knight-Ridder owns 30 newspapers and eight television stations
and has interests in cable television.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Unchanged to Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose in a technical rally Friday to
finish at the highs of the day.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose 17-32 point, or
about $5 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 9.19
percent from 9.25 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said the credit market sold off a bit in early trading,
but demand for bonds set in and prices climbed higher throughout
the rest of the session.
   ``We closed with a rally at the end,'' noted William Brachfeld,
an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities Inc.
   Analysts said there was no strong reaction to a Labor Department
report that consumer prices climbed a modest 0.3 percent in June.
The overall June increase, which matched the rise for May, would
amount to an annual inflation rate of 4.2 percent if prices climbed
at the same pace for 12 straight months.
   Robert Brusca, chief economist and senior vice president at
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., said the report was in
line with expectations. He also noted that declines in gasoline and
clothing costs nearly offset a sharp increase in food prices, which
did not give traders a clear reason to believe inflation is on the
rise.
   A resurgence of inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to
tighten credit by nudging interest rates higher.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues finished 3-32 point higher, intermediate
maturities were [ point to 5-32 point higher, and 20-year issues
were up 17-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a business information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, was up 2.55 at 1,137.72.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.47 to 282.02.
   Three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, fell 1 basis point to a
discounted rate of 6.74 percent and a yield of 6.94 percent.
Six-month bills fell 7 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.02
percent and a yield of 7.38 percent, while one-year bills fell 3
basis points to 7.23 percent to yield 7.73 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7 13-16 percent, down from 7~
percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>First Texas Asks For Help From Federal Regulators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's largest savings and loan holding
company, First Texas Financial Corp., is seeking federal help for
its troubled thrifts, company officials said Thursday.
   A proposal submitted to federal regulators by First Texas
includes financial backing from New York investor Saul Steinberg's
Reliance Insurance Co., and private funding by First Texas Chairman
and Chief Executive J. Livingston Kosberg and Dallas real estate
developer Richard C. Strauss.
   First Texas Financial is the parent company of Dallas-based
First Texas Savings Association and Houston-based Gibraltar Savings
Association.
   The plan would provide more than $250 million in private funds
in return for an undetermined amount from the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., a First Texas spokeswoman who wished to
remain anonymous said Thursday.
   ``I can confirm there has been an offer and that we are
optimistic about it, but at this time, we don't know how much
federal money is involved,'' she said.
   With 44 branches in the state, First Texas has assets of $3.4
billion. Gibraltar, with 53 locations and assets of $6.1 billion,
is the state's largest thrift.
   Together, the two thrifts lost $169.9 million in the first
quarter.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank is in the midst of implementing the
Southwest Plan, a program to merge, close or consolidate more than
100 insolvent thrifts in Texas.
   Regulators have announced three consolidations of 11 thrifts in
Texas since February involving $2.2 billion in FSLIC aid.
   The president of the FHLB in Dallas, George Barclay, said he
hopes to close or merge 20 more thrifts by Sept. 30.

   American Brands Inc. said Thursday its second-quarter profit
climbed 44 percent, while another food and tobacco concern, RJR
Nabisco Inc., said its profit rose 18 percent for the quarter.
   Consumer products giant Kraft Inc. the sale of its Duracell
battery division helped spark a seven-fold increase in its
second-quarter earnings, and Colgate-Palmolive Co. said its profit
rose 17 percent from a year ago.
   American Brands, headquartered in Old Greenwich, Conn., said its
net income for the quarter ended June 30 soared 44 percent to
$154.6 million, or $1.57 a share, from $107.4 million, or 94 cents
a share, in the year-ago period.
   Revenue jumped 27 percent to $2.49 billion from $1.96 billion in
the second quarter of 1987. The figures include subsidiaries
purchased from E-II Holdings Inc. in February in a deal valued at
$2.7 billion.
   Among the company's core businesses, tobacco and distilled
spirits put in a strong performance. Sales in the hardware, home
and office products unit more than doubled, partly because of
acquisitions.
   For the year's first half, the company reported net income of
$305 million, or $2.97 a share, up 28 percent from $238.2 million,
or $2.09 a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue totaled $5.40
billion, up 29 percent from $4.18 billion in the first half of 1987.
   American Brands' main brands are Lucky Strike and Pall Mall
cigarettes, Jim Beam bourbon and Gilbey's gin.
   RJR Nabisco, based in Atlanta, reported its second-quarter
profit rose to $354 million, or $1.50 a share, from $299 million,
or $1.16 a share, in 1987.
   The company said its sales rose 6.5 percent to $4.3 billion from
$4 billion in the second quarter of 1987.
   RJR Nabisco businesses include R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Nabisco
Brands, Del Monte Foods and Planters LifeSavers.
   The company's tobacco sales for the second quarter were $1.8
billion, up 7.5 percent from $1.7 billion in 1987. Income from
operations rose to $496 million, a 7.6 percent increase from $461
miullion the prior year.
   The company's food business division achieved second quarter
sales of $2.5 billion, an increase of 5.9 percent from $2.3 billion
in 1987. Income from operations rose to $271 million, up 14 percent
from $238 million.
   For the first six months of the year, RJR said it earned $627
million, or $2.59 a share, on revenue of $8.08 billion, compared
with a profit of $519 million, or $2 a share, on revenue of $7.51
billion, a year earlier.
   Kraft, based in Glenview, Ill., reported net income of $785
million, or $6.10 per share, in the second quarter, compared with
$113 million, or 83 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales increased 13 percent to $2.8 billion from $2.4 billion in
the second quarter of 1987, Kraft said.
   The results include a $686 million after-tax gain from the June
24 sale of Duracell to a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
Excluding a total gain of $658 from that transaction and other
discontinued operations, Kraft's net income for the quarter totaled
$127.3 million.
   Kraft's largest division, U.S. consumer foods, had sales of $1.2
billion to lead all units in revenue production, while the U.S.
commercial foods division showed the greatest improvement with a 21
percent increase in sales to nearly $882 million.
   For the first half of 1988, Kraft had net income of $903.5
million, or $7 per share, compared with $265 million, or $1.94 per
share, for the first half of 1987.
   First-half revenues increased 14.5 percent, to $5.4 billion from
$4.7 billion.
   Colgate-Palmolive, maker of soaps, toilet and health care
products and pet food, reported net income of $65.5 million, or 96
cents a share, up 17 percent from $56.1 million, or 82 cents a
share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   Sales for the New York-based Colgate totaled $1.19 billion, up 9
percent from $1.09 billion a year ago.
   The company noted that profits from its household and personal
care operations showed strong gains overseas. Specialty marketing
sales were boosted by increased sales at Hill's Pet Products, which
recently began advertising nationally.
   For the first six months, net income rose 16 percent to $130.9
million, or $1.91 a share, from $112.5 million, or $1.62 a share in
the year-ago period. Revenue totaled $2.33 billion, up 12 percent
from $2.08 billion in the first half of 1987.

   H.J. Heinz Co. said Friday its agreement to
acquire Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. has been terminated.
   The announcement comes two months after the U.S. Justice
Department said it would file suit to stop the deal on anti-trust
grounds.
   The federal regulators said that Heinz's wholly owned Star-Kist
Foods Inc. and San Diego-based Bumble Bee account for half of the
$1 billion retail canned tuna market in the United States.
   Heinz argued that foreign tuna canners would provide sufficient
competition to keep prices down.
   Heinz said it wanted Bumble Bee for economies of scale and cited
Star-Kist and Bumble Bee plants on Puerto Rico that are separated
by only a chain-link fence.
   Termination of the merger was announced in a statement from
Heinz late Friday, when its spokesmen were unavailable to elaborate.
   The deal was announced in February. The Justice Department
objected in May, and in June Heinz extended the merger agreement
while it studied the government's position.
   Heinz never disclosed the purchase price for Bumble Bee, a
former Castle & Cooke unit that was taken private by managers and
investors in 1985 for $60 million.
   The other leading U.S. producer of canned tuna is Chicken Of The
Sea, owned by Ralston Purina.

   The government on Friday ordered state mines
to sell their silver to the Central Bank and offered private miners
more money for the metal in an effort to boost Peru's faltering
economy.
   Agriculture Minister Remigio Morales Bermudez said the
government may use the silver to build up a $750 million reserve to
import food.
   Current silver sales contracts will be respected and private
mine companies can still sell their silver abroad independently,
according to a decree published Friday in the official gazette El
Peruano.
   Analysts said it was unclear if the government would negotiate
new sales contracts with the silver it controls.
   The decree said the silver is earmarked to boost Peru's foreign
reserves, which have declined dramatically.
   A lack of dollar reserves to purchase imports needed for
economic growth has sparked widespread shortages of basic consumer
and industrial items and contributed to Peru's rocketing inflation,
estimated to reach 400 percent this year.
   The action comes with the nation's important mineral industry
slowed due to an indefinite nationwide mining strike, which began
Monday.
   The strike and the government new silver measures have created
uncertainty in international metal markets, causing some commodity
prices to fluctuate, news reports said.
   Silver futures posted sharp gains on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the continuing miners' strike in Peru. If
the government's plan to buy the metal continues, analysts said it
would likely prove bullish for silver prices.
   Peru is the world's second leading supplier of the metal behind
Mexico and a major source of copper, lead, zinc and gold.
   Private producers account for 58 percent of Peru's annual silver
output, estimated at 60 million ounces last year. Silver exports in
1987 reached $300 million. Total mineral exports were $1.2 billion,
slightly less than half of all sales abroad.
   The decree included an offer for private silver producers to
sell their production to the state in contracts lasting up to three
years.
   Both state and private silver producers would be paid 15 percent
more for their output than the international silver price. The
decree said payment would be in local currency at a floating bank
exchange rate. The rate is slightly less that the free market
exchange rate, which was 202 intis to the dollar Thursday.
   The government currently requires private and state mining firms
to exchange the dollars they receive from foreign mineral sales at
a fixed exchange rate of 101 intis to the dollar.
   Despite the higher price offered in the decree, industry
analysts said it was unclear how private miners would react. They
said the government has frequently altered its exchange rates and
if the floating bank rate were frozen, Peru's high inflation could
erode any gains the measure holds for mine companies.
   The nation's largest silver mines have continued to work despite
the strike, industry officials said. But silver mining operations
at Centromin, the largest state-owned silver producer, have been
cut by at least 50 percent, according to company and federation
officials.
   The strike organizer, the National Federation of Mine, Metal and
Steel Workers, which claims to represent 75 percent of the nation's
mine workers, is demanding unified labor contracts among all
unionized miners and quarterly cost of living salary increases. The
government has rejected the demands.

   The Fashion Channel Network Inc., which
sells clothes through cable television, said Friday it has filed
for court protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy law.
   The Fashion Channel said it was the result of ``severe liquidity
problems'' but didn't supply financial data.
   The company said it was negotiating an arrangement with a third
party to continue the company's purchasing and sales operations,
and intended to keep distributing the program through present cable
systems.
   The company also is discussing investments by third parties, it
said.
   According to information published earlier this year by the
Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau Inc., The Fashion Channel was
carried on cable systems that had 7.7 million subscribers.

   Most crop futures prices moved lower Friday on the Chicago Board
of Trade in a lackluster session featuring profit-taking and
uncertainty about the Farm Belt weather outlook for the weekend and
beyond.
   On other markets, silver futures were sharply higher; livestock
and meat were mostly higher; energy futures were lower; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   Soybean prices for near-term delivery fell for the fifth
straight day, bringing the August contract to just over $8.30 a
bushel, the lowest price for near-month delivery since June 2.
   Grain and soybean prices fell sharply earlier in the week as
showers swept across the dusty Midwest. The market has been unable
to sustain a rally since then because of speculation that the
drought pattern that drove soybeans to a 15-year high of nearly $11
a bushel on June 23 has weakened, analysts said.
   ``The bulls are really grasping here, trying to get things
recovered,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``What we need (to make prices rise) is a
return to hot, dry weather.''
   Forecasters generally expected temperatures in the Midwest to
turn warmer over the weekend but some also predicted scattered
showers, and traders were hesitant to establish new positions.
   ``Everybody's a little gun-shy because the last time we were
supposed to just get showers we got some good rains,'' said John
Frazier, grain specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a
6-to-10-day forecast calling for hot and mostly dry conditions to
prevail in the Farm Belt during the latter part of next week.
   Losses in the wheat market were limited by Agriculture
Department reports of new export deals with China, India and Iraq,
analysts said.
   Wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the contract
for delivery in September at $3.84{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 4{
cents lower with September at $3.12{ a bushel; oats were 9{ cents
lower to 2{ cents higher with September at $2.60 a bushel; soybeans
were 12 cents lower to 20 cents higher with August at $8.30{ a
bushel.
   Silver futures fell on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   The market reacted with skepticism to potentially bullish
reports that the Peruvian central bank planned to acquire all of
the nation's silver output _ accounting for 20-35 percent of world
production _ instead of allowing it to be sold on the international
market.
   ``If in fact they do hold it back for a long period of time,
it's very bullish for silver,'' said Jack Barbanel, director of
futures trading for Gruntal & Co. in New York.
   But, he said, ``the information is really mixed on whether
they're going to hold it back. And the market just cannot gauge
what is going to be the final outcome of this.''
   Gold settled unchanged to 20 cents higher with August at $442.90
a troy ounce; silver was 13.1 cents to 14.8 cents lower with July
at $7.606 a troy ounce.
   Near-month pork futures advanced their permitted limits on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the second consecutive session in
response to strong cash markets and anticipation of a seasonal
upswing in retail demand.
   Cattle futures advanced in cautious trading ahead of the USDA's
quarterly 13-state and monthly 7-state cattle-on-feed reports.
   The reports showed slightly more cattle being fattened for
slaughter than the trade had expected and analysts pronounced it
slightly bearish for near-term contracts.
   More startling was the USDA's projected third-quarter marketings
figure of 6.2 million head, which would make the number of cattle
sold for slaughter during the current quarter the largest in U.S.
history, said Chuck Levitt, livestock analyst in Chicago for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The USDA also issued a monthly cold storage report showing 104.7
million pounds of frozen pork bellies in storage on June 30, a 220
percent increase over a year ago and the third-largest June 30
figure in history.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .55 cent higher with August at
66.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .97 cent higher
with August at 77.37 cents a pound; hogs were .42 cent lower to the
limit 1.50 cents higher with ugust at 46.12 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.45 cents lower to 2 cents higher with July at
39.75 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices were slightly lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after Persian Gulf developments cast a pall on
early trading and technical factors brought the market back.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 16 cents
lower with September at $16.38 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent
to .73 cent lower with August at 44.95 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was unchanged to .18 cent lower with August at 52.07 cents
a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 3.60 points lower at 263.55.
