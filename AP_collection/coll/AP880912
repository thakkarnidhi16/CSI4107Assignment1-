   President Mengistu Haile Mariam
marked the 14th anniversary of Ethiopia's Marxist revolution Monday
with a brief address devoted to the nation's longstanding civil war
in the north.
   Government troops and civilians mobilized since the conflict
intensified in March are ``presently engaged in a bitter fight,''
Mengistu told the thousands of people packed into the capital's
downtown Revolution Square.
   His forces claim to have repulsed insurgencies in its
northernmost province, Eritrea, and Eritrea's southern neighbor,
Tigray, where Ethiopia says it has retaken all major cities and
towns since the rebels overran the region in April and May.
   No major engagements have been reported with the separatist
Eritrean People's Liberation Front since the government in May said
its forces had foiled rebel attempts to take the strategic city of
Keren, 56 miles northwest of the provincial capital of Asmara.
   However, Mengistu said the rebels were sabotaging and
endangering the lives of all citizens and hampering the development
of public and private institutiones.
   The task ahead ``is clearly an arduous one,'' he said in his
20-minute address.
   The Eritrean guerrillas have been fighting a separatist battle
for 27 years in Africa's longest civil war. In Tigray, the Tigray
People's Liberation Front took up arms 14 years ago demanding
greater autohomy for their region.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies when he and a clique of
military men dethroned Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and replaced
the emperor's 44-year feudal reign with a Marxist government.
   One day before last year's anniversary of the revolution, the
provisional military government which had ruled since the
revolution was replaced by a People's Democratic Republic which has
a popularly elected legislature. However, power still sits with
Mengistu who has ruled Ethiopia since Feb. 12, 1977.
   In his speech, Mengistu also referred to Ethiopia's unusually
good rains this year and expressed confidence that if the wet
weather continues, the nation ``will, in a short time, be free of
food shortages which have made us the butt of an unhealthy
comment.''
   The Horn of Africa nation suffers chronic droughts which in
1984-85 led to a famine that killed an estimated 1 million people
and sparked the largest international relief effort in history.
   Rains failed again in 1987 causing widespread crop failures that
threatened an estimated 3.2 million people with starvation in
Eritrea and Tigray.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Call Off 13-Day-Old Mail Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders ended Britain's 13-day mail strike
Monday, but home and international service will remain disrupted
for two weeks as workers wade through a backlog of 150 million
letters and packages, officials said.
   The national executive board of the Union of Communication
Workers, which represents 180,000 Post Office employees, announced
its support Monday for a pact to end the walkout, said spokesman
Allen Slater.
   ``The objective by both sides should be to return to work by
Thursday,'' Slater said.
   The 100,000 striking workers will iron out return-to-work
details with managers at local post offices, he said.
   ``This has been an extremely damaging dispute for our
customers,'' said Bill Cockburn, managing director of Royal Mail
Letters, the letters and parcels division of the Post Office.
``There is a mountain of mail, and there will be an all-out effort
to move it.''
   Union Secretary-General Alan Tuffin said local union chiefs will
forge their own deals on overtime and the use of temporary workers.
   ``We are going to try to get this industry back on its feet with
the cooperation of the workforce,'' he said in a TV news broadcast
on Channel Four.
   Post Office leaders agreed to a back-to-work plan last Thursday,
but Tuffin said he wanted ``no misunderstanding'' and sent his
negotiators back to the table over the weekend.
   Monday's agreement also establishes a framework for further
discussions on the strike's central issue of regional pay
supplements.
   Post Office spokeswoman Melanie Corfield said local managers may
press returning strikers to accept a number of temporary employees
to cope with the ``Christmas-like'' volume of mail.
   International mail, first-class letters and parcels will receive
priority as the backlog is cleared, said Ms. Corfield.
   Public mailboxes, which have been sealed throughout the dispute,
will reopen ``only when we can guarantee people normal service
again,'' she said.
   The Post Office wishes to pay bonuses to new workers in London
and southeast England, where the cost of living is high and
retaining workers proves difficult.
   The union demanded that the bonuses be paid across the country
or not all and began a 24-hour work stoppage Aug. 31 that burgeoned
into a series of crippling wildcat strikes.
   Tuffin said a deal could be reached over the pay issue within
six weeks.
   About half of Britain's 1,500 local post offices closed down
during the strike and of the 82 major sorting centers, only one, in
Belfast, Northern Ireland, was open for business before the
agreement was announced Monday, said Ms. Corfield.

<HEAD>Japan To Lift Sanctions Against North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan said it will lift its sanctions against
communist North Korea on Friday, the day before the Summer Olympics
open in Seoul, South Korea, ``in the friendly and generous spirit
appropriate to a festival of peace.''
   The decision was announced Tuesday, a day after an opposition
leader returning from North Korea said the Pyongyang government was
willing to free two Japanese seamen detained for more than four
years on spying charges.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist
Party, said North Korean leaders wanted to improve North
Korean-Japanese relations.
   The relations were ruptured when Tokyo imposed the sanctions
early this year after Pyongyang's alleged bombing of a South Korean
passenger flight near Burma. North Korea denied involvement in the
disaster, which killed all 115 people aboard the aircraft last
November.
   Japanese sanctions included restrictions on contact between
Japanese and North Korean officials.
   ``Since that time, domestic and foreign interest in preventing
the recurrence of terrorism has reached an unprecedentedly high
level, indicating that the aim of showing Japan's firm attitude
against terrorism has been achieved,'' the chief Cabinet secretary,
Keizo Obuchi, said in a statement following a Cabinet meeting
Tuesday morning.
   Obuchi said Japan will lift the sanctions ``from the viewpoint
that the Games may be conducted with the utmost possible relaxation
of tension and in the friendly and generous spirit appropriate to a
festival of peace.''
   Japan is a major ally of pro-Western South Korea and maintains
no official diplomatic ties with North Korea. Japan has sought help
from third parties, including the International Red Cross and
China, in winning the freedom of Isamu Beniko and Yoshio Kuriura.
North Korea detained the two seamen in 1983 on unspecified
espionage charges.

<TEXT>
   A businessman is leaping to fill the gap
created by dropping supplies of bullfrogs, whose legs are consumed
as a cripsy delicacy in the South.
   Bruce Maghan was almost hopping in anticipation Monday of an
experimental program to raise the big, hopping amphibians.
   ``It's not really even off the ground yet. But we're pretty
excited,'' the owner of Stillashak Institutional Sea Products said
in a telephone interview from Pascagoula on the Gulf Coast.
   ``If you look what has been done in this state for the shrimp,
oyster, striped bass and redfish industies, there's no reason it
can't be done for frog legs,'' Maghan said.
   Maghan said that three years ago he was paying $2.15 to $2.20 a
pound for frog legs. The price is now about $4.06 per pound.
   ``I have been quoted as much as $5 to $5.10. That goes to show
you that the market is way up. Three years ago, I was getting about
six to eight pair of legs to the pound. Now, its about four to six
pairs per pound.
   ``But we are also looking at the remnants of supplies, and those
are depleting fast,'' he said.
   Maghan said in 1986-87, more than 8.6 million pounds of frog
legs came into the United States from India and Bangladesh. He said
the market could be as much as 10 million pounds.
   But India and Bangladesh have put a five-year moratorium on such
exports, he said.
   ``They (the bullfrogs) are wild over there and they have taken
so many of them that the insect problem has increased, so they
aren't shipping any more.
   ``But I believe there is no reason why Florida, Georgia,
Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi can't raise all the frogs we
need,'' he said.
   Maghan said the adult frogs eat insects, but he's trying to come
up with a feed that will increase their size and growth.
   He plans to start with tadpoles and raise them all the way to
adults.
   ``It is a long process,'' Maghan said. ``It is not something we
expect to do overnight. We expect to raise the critters in a pond,
but everything else is still up in the air.''

   An F-14 Tomcat jet fighter crashed in the
Atlantic Ocean Monday, and one crewman was killed and the other
missing, the Navy said.
   A fishing vessel, Jo-Boy II, managed to pick up one crewman, but
he was pronounced dead when he arrived by helicopter at Portsmouth
Naval Hospital in Virginia, authorities said.
   A search continued late Monday for the second flier.
   The F-14 based at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach,
Va., went down 22 miles east of Oregon Inlet, said Navy spokesman
P.E. Wilkinson.
   The plane, part of Oceana's Fighter Squadron 143, was practicing
air combat maneuvers with several other planes, said Lt. Cmdr. Mike
John, spokesman for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet air force.
   The identities of the dead man and the missing man were withheld
pending notification of relatives.
   Two charter boat captains carrying fishing parties watched from
several miles away as the F-14 hit the water.
   ``I saw a streak of flame and a great big fireball about 500
feet from the surface,'' said Warren Gallop, captain of the Mighty
Wind, which is based at the Oregon Inlet Fishing Center. ``I heard
an explosion and I could see stuff flying through the air. It
sounded like a big boom. It scattered stuff over a wide area.''
   John said the $35 million aircraft sank soon after impact.

<HEAD>Jordan to Buy Tornado Jets from The United Kingdom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan has reached an agreement with
Britain to buy an undisclosed number of the multi-role Tornado
fighter jets, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
   A senior air force official told The Associated Press on Monday
that the agreement was formalized during a meeting between King
Hussein and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.
   He did not say when the meeting took place, but Hussein has been
in Britain for several days on a private visit.
   The official, who requested anonymity in line with air force
regulations, refused to say what the deal was worth or how many
planes were involved. Petra also did not give such details.
   Sources said earlier the king was seeking to buy 40 Tornado
warplanes.
   The agency said the deal was part of the ``the king's desire to
develop and strengthen the defense capabilities of the Jordanian
air force.''
   Jordan turned to Britain and France after the U.S. Congress
blocked a deal involving the sale of F-20 and F-16 warplanes to the
Jordanian air force.
   Last year, Saudi Arabia bought 72 Tornado jets from Britain for
similar reasons. In February, France agreed to sell Jordan 20
Mirage 2000 fighter jets.

   Both accidents were blamed on pilot error. Experts say hard
evidence rarely exists to show pilots erred because they were tired.
   ``The problem with fatigue is it's not a bent piece of metal.
It's not a liquid that can be analyzed in the laboratory,'' said
Dr. Stanley Mohler, a former FAA official who heads aerospace
medicine at Wright State University.
   Government and airline officials acknowledge they've heard tales
of pilots napping in flight and of mistakes attributed to
sleepiness, but they play down such reports.
   ``There isn't evidence that there is a fatigue problem,'' said
Walt Coleman, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, a trade
group representing the major airlines.
   T. Allan McArtor, administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration, says more research is needed into the effects of
long flights on the circadian system, or biological clock. But he
denies a safety problem.
   ``There's no evidence that shows it makes flying any more
hazardous,'' McArtor said.
   Some 600 accounts of missed approaches, near misses and near
tragedies blamed on fatigue show up in voluntary pilot reports
filed with the Air Safety Reporting System, an office run by NASA
for pilots who want to confess to mistakes and report risky
conditions without fear of retribution.
   Enough reports were filed by crews for commuter airlines and air
taxis that the ASRS sent a memo to the FAA in May identifying
``recurring pilot deviations directly attributable to fatigue and
cockpit workload.''
   ``The big chunk that we have perceived out of this information
is that fatigue is a real issue that needs to be addressed,'' said
Bill Reynard, who runs the reporting system.
   Even though the reports are protected by anonymity and are not
investigated by the ASRS, Reynard believes they are truthful.
   ``It is absolutely, positively valid that these numbers are
real,'' he said. ``Our analysts have been in aviation for 20 to 30
years. They are very good at spotting a ringer.''
   The reports provide a litany of horror stories:
   _ In February 1987, the co-pilot of a cross-country jumbo jet
already descending into Boston looks up from his coffee cup to see
the captain asleep at the controls.
   ``I think we need to look at the world of the pilot and see what
more hours and labor unrest is doing,'' he writes.
   _ The next month a large airliner from Los Angeles to Baltimore
sinks 4,000 feet below its assigned altitude, coming close enough
to another plane to set off alarms at the air traffic control
center.
   ``I do not believe it would have occurred to a rested crew,''
writes a crewmember, noting he flew all night to Cleveland then
continued to Baltimore into the morning sun. ``Duty regulations ..
. do not in any way address the debilitating effects of flying all
night and especially of continuing to work into the morning hours.''
   _ Last November the co-pilot of another large jet begins a
takeoff roll from Fort Lauderdale without setting the flaps, an
error then already suspected in the Northwest DC-9 crash in Detroit
that had killed 154 people three months earlier.
   Cockpit warning horns sound and takeoff is aborted. In the
Detroit crash, the horns failed to sound.
   ``It is quite sobering to consider that the combination of
fatigue and distractions could so easily cause a breakdown in my
own cockpit discipline,'' writes the co-pilot, who had flown for
three days with little sleep.
   ``Complacency was not a factor,'' he writes. ``Simple fatigue
was the culprit.''
   That incident affords a good look at the shadowy effects of
fatigue. Planes don't crash because pilots are tired, say the
experts. Fatigue becomes a killer only when something else _
equipment or the weather _ goes wrong as well.
   If, for example, the Fort Lauderdale flight's warning horns had
failed, as they did in Detroit, the tired pilot's oversight could
have been fatal. In the Detroit crash, there was no evidence
fatigue played a role.
   On paper, FAA flight rules seem favorable to pilots. Domestic
pilots are limited to eight hours' flight time a day; overseas
pilots fly no more than 12. All pilots must get at least eight
hours of rest between flight sequences.
   However, the regulations count only scheduled flight time, not
the hours spent on the ground between flights. So scheduled
turnarounds and unscheduled delays can push a crew's day up to 16
hours.
   Scheduling agreements between airlines and pilots once kept
flight hours well below federal standards, but concessions to
management have become commonplace amid the fierce competition
brought on by deregulation.
   John Mazor, spokesman for the Airline Pilots Association, said
that 10 years ago, at the start of deregulation, the typical
contract limited flight time to a maximum of 75 to 80 hours per
month. Today, he says, it's 80-85 hours.
   Continental pilots, who lost their contract when the company
reorganized in 1983, now fly 20 percent more hours a month. The
company says its flight hours are still well under the industry
average.
   ``Our ... work rules remove the anti-productivity aspects to
allow reasonable productivity,'' said spokesman Bruce Hicks.
   Northwest pilots complain their company has interpreted
regulations to allow international crews flying home to take on
additional domestic flights, adding up to four flight hours to
their day. Northwest, citing ongoing negotiations with the pilots,
declined to comment.
   When United Airlines acquired Pan American's Pacific routes in
1986, its pilots faced extended flight hours and reduced crew size
on the longer routes. A separate contract added a day of work each
month.
   ``The Pan Am guys had a cushy job, but the company fell on hard
times,'' said John Ferg, United's director of flight operations.
``We're trying to strike a balance between what's fair and
equitable for the pilots and what's economical.''
   Many pilots interviewed complain the scales are tipped too far
toward economics at the expense of safety.
   ``I've got 400 people in that airplane and I take it very
seriously,'' said a United 747 pilot. ``It's a responsibility, and
you know this isn't good for the passengers.''

<HEAD>Asians Keep Close Watch On Immigration Issue In Australia</HEAD>

   Asians are keeping a close eye on an immigration
debate in Australia to see if it will mean a slow down in the flow
of Asian emigrants into the country. Some Asians say they see signs
of racism.
   Several Asian newspapers have published editorials reminding
Australia of its growing economic links with Asian countries.
   ``The outcome of the intense immigration debate now under way in
Australia will either confirm or confound the view Asians hold that
a strong undercurrent of racism exists in the `Lucky Country',''
the conservative English-language South China Morning Post of Hong
Kong said.
   ``While Australia was founded on British values, the facts today
are that politically and economically the country cannot always
look West.''
   In Australia, a growing influx of Asian migrants is in the
background of a debate over immigration rules and multi-culturalism
_ a policy that encourages migrants to keep cultural links with
their homelands.
   John Howard, leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party,
says immigration from Asia should be slowed in the interests of
social harmony and that immigrants should embrace the
English-speaking majority's Anglo-Saxon cultural values.
   ``I am not saying I would end Asian immigration,'' he said.
``But what I am saying is that it is a legitimate concern of any
community and any government to say that it is imposing social
tensions and that it is imposing a lack of social cohesion.''
   The government has proposed legislation that would prohibit the
use of race or ethnic origins as criteria for judging potential
immigrants' acceptability. Howard, who heads a two-party national
opposition, is against the bill but has lost support recently in
Parliament.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke, of the Labor Party, has vowed to fight
any move to restrict Asian immigration and says he would maintain a
policy of non-discrimination even if he thought it would mean
losing an election.
   Australia, a continent with only 16 million people near Asia's
huge population of 3 billion, is an attractive destination for
emigrants. It is called ``lucky'' because of its rich resources and
comfortable climate.
   The Australian Bureau of Statistics says the number of Asian
immigrants climbed by one-third in the past year. Out of 116,430
immigrants between January and November 1987, 47,450 were Asians,
compared with 36,360 in the same period in 1986. Australia has
taken in 100,000 Vietnamese since 1975, when the Indochina war
ended, and has a growing Chinese community.
   Emigration counselors in several Asian countries list Australia
as attractive for its climate, proximity and educational
opportunities for children. Increasing numbers of Asians with
capital and business experience are snowing interest in emigrating
to Australia.
   In Taiwan, Australia now surpassed Canada and the United States
as the top choice of emigrants.
   ``People here barely knew anything about Australia three years
ago,'' said David Chang, manager of Taiwan's Queter International
Company, which handles emigration applications to Australia. ``But
emigrating to Australia has become a fad now.''
   Chang said he understood why Australia had doubled the capital
requirement for business emigrants to 500,000 Australian dollars
($410,000) in the past year.
   ``Australia no longer needs foreign capital and personnel now as
much as before. It is only natural that it closes the door a bit.''
   In Hong Kong, where emigration is on the upswing due to
nervousness over China's taking sovereignty of the British colony
in 1997, Australia is the second most popular destination after
Canada.
   Janet Sekavs, regional migration director in Australia's
Consulate in Hong Kong, said 6,431 Filipinos emigrated to Australia
in 1986, compared with 5,140 from Hong Kong and 5,032 from Malaysia.
   Chan Ka-wai, editor of The Emigrant, Hong Kong's magazine on
emigration, said he thought the number of emigration applications
would remain high even if Australia imposes new curbs.
   ``Australia is strange,'' Chan said. ``It is in Asia but it does
not treat itself as an Asian country. It is a multi-racial country
and economically it should have the potential to accept more
people.''
   Susie Tse, migration service manager of Price Waterhouse
emigration consultancy in Hong Kong, said, ``It would be racist if
Australia refuses Asians. But from my nine years' experience in
Australia, I have not felt any racism and am not sure if it is just
over-exaggeration by the press.''
   The fiercest reaction has come from a Malaysian newspaper, the
Star in Kuala Lumpur, where editor V.K. Chin wrote in a recent
column that Australians he described as racists make Asian
immigrants ``feel inadequate, insecure and even sub-human.''
   ``Based on the statements of some of these pillars of the
Australian political establishment, it would appear that inside
every Liberal senator or member of Parliament is a racist
struggling to get out,'' Chin wrote.
   ``Australia may be a big, wide-open country but it is in danger
of being led by small-minded people with petty prejudices and
attitudes more suited to the Victorian age.''

<TEXT>
   For years, Republican James Jeffords,
Vermont's lone member of the U.S. House, has enjoyed the backing of
many state Democrats. Two years ago, he even won re-election with
both the GOP and Democratic nominations.
   This year, though, as Jeffords seeks the seat of retiring U.S.
Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., his popularity among Democrats is
being used against him by GOP challenger Michael Griffes, who calls
himself the real Republican in the race.
   Griffes and Jeffords will face off next Tuesday in Vermont's
Republican primary. The winner will face Democrat William Gray, a
former U.S. attorney, in the November election. Gray is unopposed
in Tuesday's Democratic primary.
   Jeffords is the clear favorite in the primary, but his support
of Democratic initiatives over the years has angered many of the
GOP faithful, including former four-term Gov. Richard Snelling, who
donated $1,000 to the Griffes campaign.
   ``Jim Jeffords, while he clearly has provided a long service to
Vermont, has not, in my opinion, been very often mindful of the
fact that he gets his nominations from the Republican Party,'' said
Snelling, himself considered a moderate to liberal.
   While Snelling was willing to give money to Griffes, he withheld
his formal endorsement, saying the 35-year-old political newcomer
had not ``sufficiently established his credentials.''
   And that is clearly Griffes' weak point. While Jeffords, 54, has
lived his life in Vermont and served as a state senator, attorney
general and member of the U.S. House, Griffes had lived in the
state only a year or so in the 1970s before returning here this
spring to challenge Jeffords.
   He served in the Navy and then worked for Grumman Corp., a major
defense contractor, in Washington. He said he decided to move back
to Vermont to challenge Jeffords when the congressman was the only
Republican in the House last fall to vote for a $12 billion
deficit-reduction measure backed by the Democratic leadership on a
crucial 206-205 vote.
   That vote was only one of the many times Jeffords has broken
party ranks. In 1981, he was the sole House Republican to vote
against President Reagan's tax-cut package. In 1987, Jeffords had
the second-highest anti-Reagan voting record among Republicans in
the House, as analyzed by Congressional Quarterly magazine. He
opposed the president on 71 percent of the key votes.
   ``When you get to the point where you start making decisions or
doing things based upon political expedience, you've worn out your
usefulness as someone who can really help,'' said Jeffords, who
says he makes his decisions on what's best for Vermonters, not on
what's best for the Republicans.
   Griffes campaigns by saying that Jeffords should be honest and
seek the Democratic nomination. ``My record will be more like Bob
Stafford's and not like House Speaker Jim Wright's,'' says Griffes,
a reference to Vermont's retiring Republican senator and the
Democratic speaker of the House.
   Jeffords is considered the strong favorite in the November
election, should he win the primary, because of his strong
Democratic support.
   The Republican primary for the U.S. Senate is one of three
statewide contests that will be decided Tuesday.
   With Jeffords giving up his House seat, four Democrats and two
Republicans are seeking their respective party nominations. The two
winners will be joined on the November ballot by Burlington Mayor
Bernard Sanders, a socialist who is running a strong independent
campaign for the House seat, and candidates representing the
Liberty Union, the Libertarian Party and the Small Is Beautiful
Party.
   Former Lt. Gov. Peter Smith is favored to win the Republican
congressional race, while the Democratic race, featuring former
Secretary of State James Guest, House Majority Leader Paul Poirier,
Senate President Pro Tem Peter Welch and University of Vermont
professor Dolores Sandoval, is considered wide open.
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin, seeking her third term, is unopposed in
Tuesday's primary, as is her Republican challenger, state Rep.
Michael Bernhardt.

<HEAD>Big Bucks Spent For Proxmire's Seat</HEAD>

   Big spending has become a big issue in
Tuesday's heated Democratic primary battle for the seat held for 31
years by retiring Sen. William Proxmire, whose last re-election
campaign cost him $145.10.
   Milwaukee millionaire Herbert Kohl, running in his first
election, stands accused of trying to buy the nomination by
spending more than $2 million, much of it on TV advertising and
much of it his own money.
   ``Politics should be people, ideas and leadership, not
multimillion-dollar TV hype,'' said Secretary of State Douglas La
Follette, one of Kohl's Democratic foes.
   Wisconsin is one of six states holding primary elections Tuesday.
   Kohl, 53, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks of the National
Basketball Association, said he had to buy the ads to win the name
recognition enjoyed by La Follette, former Gov. Anthony Earl and
Edward Garvey, who was the Democratic Senate nominee two years ago.
   ``I'm not looking to get ahead of the other (candidates),'' Kohl
said. ``I just want to get to the point where we are even.''
   On the Republican side, state Senate Minority Leader Susan
Engeleiter, 36, and Stephen B. King, 47, former chairman of the
state GOP, are running a more ideological race. He has labeled her
a liberal and she has called him an ultra-conservative.
   Proxmire, who devoted nearly 32 years in the Senate to fighting
for budget cuts, said he was disappointed by the hefty spending in
the race to replace him. Proxmire said he spent $145.10 in breezing
to re-election in 1982.
   Kohl, whose slogan is ``nobody's senator but yours,'' said he
would not be obligated to special interest groups if elected
because the money he spent was mainly his own.
   In his last campaign spending report, Kohl said he spent nearly
$2.1 million between his June 1 entry into the campaign and Aug.
24. He reported more than $1.5 million hand.
   ``We're spending way too much,'' Earl said. As of Aug. 24, Earl
had spent $431,719 and Garvey $360,000. La Follette reported
expenditures of $15,536. Engeleiter reported she spent $858,580
through Aug. 24, and King $342,907.
   One early Democratic candidate, Rep. Jim Moody, dropped out
shortly after Kohl's entry. He said he couldn't afford to compete
with Kohl.
   A recent poll commissioned by several TV stations showed Kohl
with 35 percent support and Earl with 33 percent among those who
said they were likely to vote. Garvey had 16 percent and La
Follette 6 percent. Nine percent were undecided.
   On the GOP side, Engeleiter led King 48 percent to 32 percent.
   Earl, 52, is a Madison attorney and former legislator who lost
his 1986 bid for re-election as governor to Republican Tommy G.
Thompson.
   Garvey, 48, a lawyer and former executive director of the
National Football League Players Association, lost a close battle
to unseat Republican Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr. in 1986.
   La Follette, 48, in his third term as secretary of state, was a
professor at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside before his
election to the state Senate in 1972. He is a distant relative of
the La Follette family that produced several top Wisconsin
politicians, including two governors, and was an unsuccessful
candidate for lieutenant governor in 1978.
   King, now a businessman, is a former FBI agent who later served
John Mitchell when Mitchell headed President Nixon's
Watergate-tainted re-election campaign. His major campaign
fund-raiser featured Oliver North, a key figure in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Engeleiter, a 12-year veteran of the Legislature.
   Differences between her and King became personal when King
brought up the subject of Engeleiter's two children, ages 1 and 4.
``If my family were young, if they were pre-schoolers, I would not
be making this race,'' King said.
   Engeleiter countered that nearly three out of four women work
outside the home, and that under King's philosophy, neither Kasten
nor Republican Rep. Thomas Petri would have a place in Congress.
   Here are highlights of the voting Tuesday:
   ARIZONA _ A large number of GOP legislators who voted to impeach
or convict ex-Gov. Evan Mecham earlier this year are being
challenged by his ultra-conservative supporters.
   MINNESOTA _ Both GOP Sen. David Durenberger and his likely
Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III,
face minor opposition from within their parties.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican Rep. Judd Gregg is favored to win the
nomination for governor to succeed John Sununu, who is retiring.
Democrat Paul McEachern has no primary opposition.
   VERMONT _ Rep. Jim Jeffords faces conservative Michael Griffes
for the GOP nomination for the seat of retiring Republican Sen.
Robert Stafford. William Gray is the unopposed Democratic nominee.
   UTAH _ Democrats Craig S. Oliver and Robert W. Stringham both
seek the nomination to oppose three-term Republican Rep. Howard C.
Nielson for Congress.

   Buffalo graze
nonchalantly near flaming trees, but people are not reacting so
coolly, and residents once worried about losing business to forest
fires now fear losing their homes.
   Fire has destroyed buildings around the Old Faithful geyser and
has threatened tourist towns on the periphery of the country's
first national park.
   The Montana towns of Cooke City and Silver Gate outside the
park's northeast entrance were evacuted twice last week. Jardine,
Mont., near the northern gate, was evacuated Saturday.
   Firefighters saved Cooke City and Silver Gate, but only by
burning thousands of acres of forest to remove fuel from the fire's
path. The so-called backfires left the once-picturesque towns
flanked by black, skeletal trees.
   ``All we can do ... is herd it around improvements and
structures _ and don't get anybody killed,'' said Bob Martines, a
structure protection officer in Cooke City.
   The 2.2 million-acre park, dedicated in 1872, attracts more than
2 million visitors a year who marvel at geysers and hot springs,
mountain scenery and wild animals.
   But tourists have stayed away in droves this summer, and
residents of tourism-dependent towns around the park have
complained bitterly about the Park Service's initial reluctance to
respond to the fires.
   ``A guy gets really bitter when it keeps dragging on and on and
on,'' said David Klatt of Cooke City, who spent spent three days in
a motel room outside of town last week, waiting out an evacuation.
   In this summer of heat and drought, Yellowstone is suffering the
worst fires in at least 200 years.
   Forest fires have charred more than 1 million acres in
Yellowstone and in the surrounding national forests and parks in
Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho.
   Each day, firefighters pray for rain, but at park headquarters
near Mammoth Hot Springs this is the third-driest summer on record.
Only 1.6 inches of rain fell at Mammoth in June, July and August _
one-third the normal rainfall.
   It was also the hottest summer on record, with temperatures
steaming an average of 5 degrees above normal, the weather service
said.
   Though other areas are hard hit, Yellowstone is the top concern
of federal officials. Of $250 million spent so far on fighting
fires, $78 million has gone toward efforts around the park, said
the Boise Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates firefighting
in the West.
   Since 1972, park officials have allowed lightning-sparked fires
to burn.
   ``In the past 16 years, we had 140 fires that burned 33,000
acres. That averages about 240 acres apiece before they went out on
their own,'' said John Varley, chief of the park's research
division.
   The fires help cleanse the pine forest. They clear deadwood,
create new meadows for forage, release nutrients for new plants and
free the pines' seeds from their cones.
   A cool, wet spring lulled park officials into believing this
summer would be no different. But the heat and low humidity left
the forest more parched than kiln-dried lumber.
   By July 15, when the Park Service decided to start fighting the
fires, it was too late to stop them.
   Fire crew boss John Borton has battled forest fires in the West
for 18 years, but the blaze he had been fighting and sleeping near
for 25 nights was something new.
   ``This is the edge of a fire that goes back 50 miles,'' he said.
``It's as out of control as it was six weeks ago. This is the most
extreme fire behavior that just about any of us has ever seen.''

<HEAD>`Red Barron' of Florida Legislature Ousted After Three Decades</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

   Among the portraits of former Florida
Senate presidents hanging in the chamber, it's easy to pick out
Dempsey Barron. He's the one riding the horse.
   The Panhandle lawyer-rancher, who friends and foes alike call
one of the most powerful men in Florida government, exercises his
authority ``exactly like the Godfather,'' a former colleague says.
   But that era is coming to an end. The 66-year-old, auburn-haired
``Red Barron'' was narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary on
Tuesday. He lost to Vince Bruner, a Fort Walton Beach lawyer born a
year after Barron was first elected to the Legislature 32 years ago.
   A conservative Democrat, Barron served as Senate president in
1975-76, once ordering then-Gov. Reubin Askew to stay out of the
upper chamber, although in much more colorful words.
   Since then, he has served almost continuously as chairman of the
Senate Rules Committee, giving him control over the legislative
calendar and make-or-break authority over bills.
   ``He's really one of a kind,'' said Allen Morris, historian and
former clerk of the state House. ``I've been here since 1941 and
really can't think of anybody who compares to him.''
   His departure ``will reorganize the thinking in the Senate,''
Morris said. ``The senators no longer will have to puzzle over wat
Dempsey thinks of each bill.''
   In his successful primary challenge, Bruner cited Barron's
support of a tax increase and claimed Barron failed to pay
attention to constituent needs and was too cozy to state business
interests.
   His challenge was aided by feminists angered that Barron helped
kill the Equal Rights Amendment and by trial lawyers who opposed
Barron's efforts on behalf of insurance companies, many of them
represented by his law firm, to limit the size of verdicts in
negligence suits.
   ``He was the architect of the defeat of the Equal Rights
Amendment in Florida,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women. ``Good riddance! I think we helped to dig
his grave.''
   As a result of Barron's departure, some colleagues have been
predicting a more partisan and open Senate, and reforms to reduce
the virtually dictatorial power of the leadership.
   Barron exercised his power ``exactly like The Godfather,'' said
former Democratic Sen. Roberta Fox. ``His ability to do that was
seductive, not in a sexual sense, but he had a truly seductive
personality.''
   The power was wielded with little regard to party labels and
party loyalty.
   When unable to get his way in Democratic caucuses, he forged
coalitions between conservatives in his own party, or
``Dempseycrats,'' and Republicans. He angered Democrat leaders by
throwing his support to Republican candidates for national and
statewide office, including Bob Martinez in his successful run for
governor in 1986.
   Republicans did much of the mourning over his loss.
   ``I'm shocked, I'm sick,'' said Tommy Thomas, a former state
Republican Party chairman.
   ``We knew he was in a tight race,'' said Brian Ballard, chief of
operations for Martinez. ``But we all thought he would make it
because he's Dempsey, he's the `Red Barron,' and he's supposed to
pull out.''
   But the Democratic state chairman, Charles Whitehead, had little
sympathy. ``Sen. Barron lost the race when he and Bob Martinez rode
their horses together and put their arms around each other at the
Bonifay Rodeo two years ago,'' Whitehead said. ``He alienated all
the Democrats in the area by doing that.
   ``And it turns out Martinez and Barron joined together to give
us the biggest tax increase we ever had.''
   Bruner had hammered Barron, usually a steadfast opponent of
taxes _ any taxes _ for his support of Florida's ill-fated, $1
billion-a-year services tax. The tax was repealed in the wake of
stiff opposition last year, but the governor and Barron wound up
accepting an even bigger increase in the general sales tax.
   Barron said he has no regrets and plans to spend more time at
his ranches in the Florida Panhandle and Wyoming.
   ``I'm a pretty private person and I'm going to live my life with
my friends and move down the road,'' he said. ``My cattle are in
good shape. I'm going to go up and cut hay. ... I've enjoyed the
ride. Shed no tears for me.''

   American Savings & Loan became the industry's
biggest financial basket case by abandoning conservative ways, and
some worry that a $2 billion federal bailout doesn't do enough to
force a return to conservatism.
   As details of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's blueprint for
reviving the nation's second-largest thrift trickle out, analysts,
legislators and competitors are sounding calls for caution.
   Some fret over the planned transfer of American to the
aggressive Bass investment group and suggestions that the revived
company could be allowed to venture beyond the standard S&L
business of home loans and savings accounts.
   Others recall what they see as regulatory inaction during the
company's four-year slide toward receivership, a slide most blame
on aggressive management, too-rapid growth and risky real estate
loans.
   American Savings & Loan Association, with headquarters in
Stockton and 186 branches throughout California, was seized by the
bank board Tuesday as a prelude to turning it over to the Robert M.
Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas. Bass will pump $550 million cash
into the insolvent thrift, and the bank board has committed $2
billion in cash and promissory notes over the next decade.
   American continues to operate; its parent company, Financial
Corp. of America in Irvine, Calif., announced plans to file a
federal bankruptcy petition.
   American's problems pre-date the 1983 joining of State Savings &
Loan and American Savings & Loan, the merger gave the company its
present form.
   State, under Chairman Robert Knapp, was known for making loans
on commercial real estate ventures and developments spurned by
other S&Ls. American was a virtual opposite, with a large branch
network and a portfolio of conservative home loans and savings
accounts on which it paid relatively low interest.
   Regulators already keeping an eye on State believed that the
merger, which created what was then the nation's biggest S&L, would
stabilize Knapp's company.
   But American grew rapidly under Knapp, in part by making loans
with fixed interest rates, a strategy that has come back to haunt
American in periods of rising rates.
   In the summer of 1984, bank board analysts were warning that
loans made by American and the old State Savings on real estate had
been made without adequate analysis of the true value of the
properties.
   Institutional investors were quietly withdrawing deposits amid a
flurry of news reports about loan problems at American.
   A real depositor run began in 1984, after the Securities and
Exchange Commission forced American to restate its second-quarter
results to account for losses on mortgage-backed securities,
turning a $31 million profit into a $107 million loss.
   Losses from the run eventually were tallied at $6 billion. In
August 1984, Knapp was forced out by the bank board and replaced by
William Popejoy.
   Popejoy, who had once been president of the old American
Savings, proceeded to cut costs, laying off 1,500 workers and
selling 475 company cars and five jets.
   Management added to the company's reserve against bad loans, to
the point where the reserve stood at more than $1.2 billion as of
June 30.
   But after a period of shrinking American, Popejoy concluded the
only way to save the company was to expand, adding branches and
buying securities backed by mortgages with fixed interest rates.
   That's counter to an industry trend in recent years to issue
mortgages with adjustable rates to protect the lender against
rising interest rates.
   Competitors have pressed the bank board to rein in American,
concerned that a big rescue would drive up their required payments
to the industry's government-run insurance fund, the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   Stockholders have accused Popejoy of failing to disclose the
extent of the company's problems with bad loans and foreclosed real
estate.
   Critics also have focused on a provision of the bailout that
would allow American to engage in merchant banking, something
beyond traditional S&L business.
   At a U.S. House Banking Committee hearing Thursday, bank board
Chairman Danny Wall, seeking to allay fears American could venture
onto risky ground, disclosed restrictions on the proposed merchant
banking operation.
   The merchant bank would be limited to $1.5 billion in assets and
would be barred from direct real estate investment or development.
   It would be barred from investing in gambling activities,
foreign firms, precious metals, commodities, futures and options.
And the bank board would have the right to step in to stop
activities it deems too risky.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frantic growth and modernization rub
shoulders with ancient tradition in a constant blur of old and new
in this vibrant city, site of the 1988 Olympics.
   Seoul, home to 10 million people, is the crown jewel in the
economic miracle that turned South Korea from one of the world's
poorest nations into an economic powerhouse in just three decades.
   The city also symbolizes how little some things have changed.
Traditional ways of life exist alongside relentless expansion, and
slums and poverty mix with prosperous suburbs and wealth.
   ``Seoul is a city of contrasts. One moment you are facing the
forefront of the 20th century and then you turn around and see a
scene out of the Middle Ages,'' said one foreign resident.
   Gleaming skyscrapers and hordes of business workers in suits and
dresses blanket the commercial districts. But just a few blocks
away are tiny, dirty workshops where laborers work at a frantic
pace for subsistence wages.
   Seoul is ringed with row after row of apartment buildings that
house the growing middle classes. The city is also dotted with
slums where up to 10 people live in a single room without plumbing.
   Dazzling new department stores in the center of Seoul show off
the latest fashions and electronic goods. Families dress up to shop
and eat hamburgers or pizza at Western restaurants and American
fast-food chains.
   Just a few blocks away is ancient Namdaemun Market where stall
holders hawk their goods to throngs of people packed into the
narrow streets. Roadside vendors offer rice, dog meat, squid and
other foods that have been staples for centuries.
   But modern values and habits appear to be prevailing. Nearly
everyone dresses in Western clothing and some mothers complain that
their children prefer hamburgers to rice.
   Divorce rates are climbing and dating has become commonplace.
Families save to buy cars and appliances for increasingly Western
lifestyles.
   Seoul, devastated during the Korean War in the early 1950s and
largely rebuilt, has few ancient or traditional Korean buildings.
   The pace in Seoul often is frantic. Workers routinely put in
10-hour shifts and work half days on Saturdays. Office workers stay
at their desks to avoid being the first to leave at the end of the
day.
   Children are inculcated with traditional Confucian values to
revere their elders, obey orders and work hard.
   ``We want foreigners to see how much our country has attained.
We are proud our country has done so well,'' said businessman Lee
Jong-ik.
   But older Koreans say the younger generation is not so mindful
of the need to work and take weeklong vacations and other unheard
of indulgences.
   ``These young Koreans are very different. They want everything
and don't listen to their elders,'' said a senior journalist who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Many things have been neglected in Seoul to concentrate on
expanding the economy as quickly as possible. Pollution has been
allowed to go largely unchecked so business can flourish. The city
has few parks or other recreational facilities.
   ``We need more time to become one of the developed countries. We
are still developing,'' said businessman Lee.
   South Koreans hope the Olympics will cement its prosperity and
modernization. They say there will be more time and money to fix
problems that have been neglected.
   ``Korea can go worldwide through the Olympics,'' said Kim
Chul-yong, a shopkeeper.
   The Olympics are portrayed as a national mission, and ordinary
people talk seriously about their duty to help ensure the Games are
a success.
   The Olympics have spread into almost every aspect of life. The
symbol of the Olympic movement _ five interlocked circles _ is
stamped on everything from milk cartons and television logos to
each Seoul subway car.
   ``The No. 1 Games. The No. 1 people,'' proclaim the subway signs.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari is
tough and highly disciplined despite his modest demeanor, qualities
he will need to govern Mexico for the next six years.
   Salinas, 40, faces protracted economic problems that affect
Mexico's relationship with the United States and a vocal opposition
that still questions whether his mandate was won fairly.
   ``Given the circumstances, he is going to have to be a great
president because otherwise the problems of the country will become
enormously complicated,'' said Manuel Camacho Solis, a close
colleague and general secretary of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
   An illustration of one lingering problem was the vote Saturday
by the Chamber of Deputies to certify Salinas' July 6 election as
president. Virtually all votes came from the governing party,
called the PRI for its Spanish initials.
   The opposition, which held the PRI to 50.7 percent of the
official vote _ the lowest since PRI took power in 1929, maintains
the presidency was won by fraud.
   Salinas was the chief architect of an economic austerity program
that rescued this nation of 85 million people from near bankruptcy
and has cut its record 159 percent inflation for 1987 by half this
year. Still, his policies remain unpopular because workers have
lost half their buying power.
   The United States and Mexico share a 2,000-mile border, and
bilateral issues include Mexico's $104 billion debt, drug
trafficking and immigration. If Mexico's economy gets worse, many
Mexicans are likely to vote with their feet by moving north.
   Salinas also will have to deal with a party that is struggling
to adapt to a more democratic environment. Many of his ideas for
decentralizing the economy and reduce the role of the state are
unpopular with politicians used to wielding unquestioned power.
   Salinas, like his three predecessors, rose in the bureaucracy
and has no previous experience in elective office, although he grew
up with politics. His father was a former commerce minister, his
mother an economist active in party politics.
   Born in Mexico City, Salinas lived in the village of Tetla in
central Mexico while researching his doctoral thesis on the
connection between government spending and political power.
   Salinas holds two master's degrees and one doctorate from
Harvard University, where his father also attended. He speaks
fluent English.
   After graduation, Salinas advanced quickly in government,
catching the eye of Miguel de la Madrid and becoming budget
secretary when de la Madrid became president in 1982.
   ``He's very comprehensive, in the sense that he seems to have a
computer in his head'' to manage many problems at once, said Otto
Granados, information secretary of the PRI.
   Another associate said Salinas ``likes to be informed on
everything'' and as president may have to learn to ``let go of
things more.''
   Salinas has had to fight the image that he is a technocrat
without political experience. His public comments are unrevealing,
he lacks charisma and is often depicted in local cartoons as a
mouse because of his baldness, big ears and mustache.
   But associates say he is forceful and demanding, requiring work
be done well and promptly.
   ``When he proposes something, he attains it,'' said one
associate, noting that Salinas decided to learn tennis about three
years ago and has since become a good amateur player.
   Salinas, who won a silver medal in an equestrian event at the
Pan American Games in 1971, also runs three or four times a week.
   He married Cecilia Occelli after a seven-year engagement that
began while they were students.
   ``He was very serious, but at the same time jovial,'' Mrs.
Salinas said this year.
   Salinas doesn't smoke, drinks only socially and spends any free
time with his wife and their three children, associates said.

   Firefighters took
advantage of chilly, damp weather Monday to strengthen lines around
fires that have ravaged nearly 1 million acres inside the park, but
hot, dry weather was predicted by midweek.
   ``It's a sleeping giant now,'' Denny Bungarz, a fire incident
commander, said during a briefing Monday. ``We want to tie it down
so when it wakes up it can't run on us.''
   Fire activity was limited Monday after a weekend of showers and
light snow _ the first significant precipitation since spring _
that gave firefighters a needed break from high wind and
temperatures that let fires grow by thousands of acres per day last
week.
   The fires inside the 2.2-million-acre park had burned 939,270
acres as of Monday.
   Temperatures remained in the 40s in the park Monday, keeping
humidity levels at up to 50 percent, but the weather was expected
to begin clearing Tuesday and temperatures were to reach 70 degrees
by Wednesday, drying the area once again.
   The cool, wet weekend also helped firefighters in surrounding
areas of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, and in Colorado and Utah,
where a 15,700-acre fire was declared under control Monday.
   ``We're more optimistic this morning than we have been for some
weeks,'' said Bill Baden, Forest Service director at the
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ``With the moisture we
have on the fires now it's cooled them down to where we can in and
work them directly.''
   The center, which coordinates forest fire suppression, calls
this the worst forest fire season in 30 years.
   Forests and brush also burned in Washington, where a 400-acre
fire that apparently began from an illegal campfire in an alpine
area of Olympic National Park had crews from three states fighting
it. And a fire in California's Gold Rush country in the Sierra
Nevada forced most of the 4,500 residents of Lake Wildwood to
evacuate for a second time Monday.
   In Oregon, a fast-moving fire broke out in dry grass and timber
in the Willamette National Forest and sheriff's deputies warned
residents about six miles southeast of Oakridge to be ready to
evacuate. The fire quickly burned 1,000 acres in rolling hills 10
to 15 miles southeast of Oakridge, forest spokeswoman Lorette
Laferriere said.
   Baden said there 28 fires still out of control in the West that
had charred 1.8 million acres.
   The favorable weather allowed Yellowstone officials to open all
roads through the park Monday except its northeastern entrance
leading to Cooke City, Mont., the route inside the park from
Mammoth Hot Springs to Canyon and Tower, and Craig Pass.
   About 1,000 Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., were to reach
Yellowstone on Wednesday and Thursday to help firefighters, while
some of the first soldiers sent to Yellowstone from Fort Lewis,
Wash., were not to be released until at least Saturday.
   ``We'll have lots of people here, so maybe we can nail this
thing,'' Bungarz said.
   Although moisture helped slow the advance of the flames, with
little growth recorded during the weekend, it would probably dry
out quickly, Bungarz said. He added, however, none of the fires
would make major progress until the area is thoroughly dried.
   ``We'd have to have a heck of a lot of rain to put the fire
out,'' said fire information officer Jim Payne on the 31,500-acre
Red Bench fire at Glacier National Park in Montana. ``You're
talking numbers of inches of rain.''
   Despite the return of warmer weather, the arrival of autumn
weather with lower temperatures and shorter days had officials
optimistic the fires would no longer make major advances.
   ``We still expect fire activity, but it won't be as intense or
as much or as fast as it has been in the past,'' said fire
information officer Sonya Capek. ``The days are getting shorter, so
the burning period is getting shorter.''
   North of the park in Montana, Gov. Ted Schwinden canceled his
sweeping ban on all recreational activities in the state's
fire-ravaged countryside because of the weekend weather.
   About 1,000 firefighters got the day off Monday in Montana
because up to a foot of snow fell on the eastern half of the
247,000-acre Cnyon Creek fire north of Helena, said fire
information officer Jane Weber. They were taken to a National Guard
facility to warm up and dry out their clothes.
   More than 100 residents evacuated from scattered homes, cabins
and ranches along the fire's eastern front were returning to the
region by Sunday and Monday, she added.
   Also in Montana, the Hellroaring Creek fire that had charred
81,900 acres and moved into Yellowstone was contained Sunday, said
information officer Chris Comstock.

<HEAD>Exiled Russian General Whose Troops Fought With Germans Is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris Smyslovsky, an anti-communist
former Russian general whose World War II unit fought with Hitler's
troops against the Red Army, has died at age 91.
   Maj. Gen. Smyslovsky, who then called himself Arthur Holmston,
led a 6,000-man contingent known as the First Russian National Army
of the German Wehrmacht.
   At the end of World War II, he and 500 remaining soldiers
managed to reach neutral Liechtenstein, where staunchly
anti-communist Prince Franz Josef II granted them political asylum.
   Death notices published in Liechtenstein newspapers said he died
in the capital Vaduz last Monday and was buried Thursday. The
mass-circulation Swiss newspaper Sonntagsblick reported his death
Sunday.
   Once an officer in the Russian Imperial Guards, Smyslosvky went
into Polish and German exile after fighting the Bolsheviks in the
civil war. After Hitler invaded Russia in 1941, he became the first
Russian to command a Russian unit fighting for the Germans on the
eastern front.
   In a 1985 interview with The Associated Press, he said his goal
was to end communism in the Soviet Union and get rid of Stalin. But
he said he was not a Nazi.
   ``I thought that the Germans would be the only ones who could
defeat the Soviets and that the Allies then would defeat the
exhausted Germans,'' he said.
   ``What the Germans did was horrible. Hitler corrupted their
souls,'' he said. ``But the Soviets destroyed a whole nation,
Russia.''
   Smyslovsky said volunteers from among Soviet prisoners of war
formed the bulk of his army, with the rest made up of prewar exiles
like himself.
   When the eastern front collapsed, the unit fled westward and was
decimated by fighting.
   But Smyslovsky and his men, still heavily armed, marched through
Austria and crossed into Liechtenstein on May 3, 1945.
   Among them was Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich, heir to the
Russian throne, whom the soldiers had picked up in Austria.
   The group encountered no resistance from Swiss border patrols
guarding the tiny principality between Austria and Switzerland,
which dissolved its army in 1868. The Russians were disarmed and
granted political asylum.
   A Soviet repatriation commission later interviewed Smyslovsky's
men, and almost half of them agreed to return.
   ``We have never heard from them again,'' Smyslovsky told AP.
   Most of the rest went into exile in Argentina, including
Smyslovsky. But in 1975, he returned to Liechtenstein with his wife
Irene, who survives him.

<TEXT>
   Six men firing submachine guns
killed a British executive in an ambush about 12 miles southwest of
this Mindanao island city, police said Sunday.
   Investigator Ernesto Fuertes said the victim, John Tree, 56, was
aboard a service vehicle that left a cocoa plantation when six
gunmen opened fire about noon Saturday.
   Tree died instantly. His Filipino driver suffered only slight
injuries, Fuertes said. Tree was vice president of the Philippine
Cocoa Estate Corp., a Malaysian-Filipino firm. Police initially
reported the firm was Swiss-American.
   Communist rebels near Davao City have threatened attacks on
American interests. But no such warning has been issued to British
businessmen.
   Lt. Col. Franco Calida, Davao area police commander, said by
telephone that the gunmen may have intended to kill the Filipino
plantation manager for Philippine Cocoa.
   The Filipino manager had refused demands to pay ``revolutionary
taxes'' to the New People's Army and had been receiving death
threats, Calida said.
   Calida added that the manager, Dioniso Capusan, was supposed to
have driven down the same road at the time of the noon attack.
Calida said he did not know if Tree had received similar threats.
   Supporters of Ferdinand Marcos meanwhile celebrated the ousted
president's 71st birthday Sunday with a rally in Manila and a giant
birthday cake in Laoag, a northern provincial capital about 250
miles to the north.
   About 5,000 Marcos supporters cheered under a light rain as
Marcos' niece, Cynthia Rocka, blew out the largest of 71 candles on
the 30-feet-by-75-feet cake, baked by dozens of volunteers.
   ``I thank you for having made by brother's birthday as great as
this,'' said Marcos' sister, Fortuna Barba, as she was presented
the first piece.
   Organizers of the cake project hoped about 24,000 people would
turn out for the celebration, but police estimated the crowd at
about 5,000.
   In Manila, about 3,000 Marcos supporters marked their leader's
birthday with fireworks and a rally in a downtown square, where
speakers denounced President Corazon Aquino, who toppled Marcos
during a popular uprising in February 1986.
   Marcos greeted his supporters in a telephone interview broadcast
over Manila radio station DZEC from Hawaii, where he fled after the
uprising.
   ``By the grace of the Almighty, we are still alive and it is my
hope that I can go back there, I can come back to the
Philippines,'' Marcos told his followers.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return, citing
national security. But the ousted president has asked the
anti-corruption court to order his return to defend himself during
a court hearing set for November.
   A decision by the court is pending. If the tribunal orders
Marcos home, the government is expected to appeal to the Supreme
Court.
   Marcos' late mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, still lies in state.
She died in Manila last May 4 but remains unburied, and Marcos
supporters say the funeral will be delayed until Mrs. Aquino allows
the former president to come home for the service.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Say They'd Be Accessible Presidents</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael
Dukakis have issued matching promises of accessibility to the White
House press, but neither was saying how often he would hold formal
presidential news conferences.
   The rival presidential nominees made their statements on news
and information policies in written responses to inquiries by the
Freedom of Information Committee of The Associated Press Managing
Editors Association.
   Their replies were made public as APME officers and committee
chairmen met in New York on Monday.
   ``I hope words like `accessible,' `candid,' `honest' and `fair'
will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with the media
by historians,'' Republican Bush said. ``It certainly is what I
will strive for during my tenure as president.''
   The Reagan administration has come under frequent criticism for
limiting access to information.
   Dukakis renewed that criticism. The Democratic nominee prefaced
his comments on his plans with a charge that ``the Reagan-Bush
administration has waged an assault on the Freedom of Information
Act with every weapon in its arsenal.''
   Dukakis said he has a proven record of accessibility to
reporters, and would continue on that course as president.
   ``Throughout my public career I've believed in a free press and
my record shows I've practiced that belief,'' he said. ``As
president, I would hope to continue this pattern of accessibility
to the White House press corps, giving them and me the opportunity
to utilize our First Amendment freedoms.
   A questionnaire prepared for the FOI committee was given to both
candidates. Bush responded directly, answering each of the
questions. Dukakis replied by issuing a two-part position paper,
with one section on the freedom of information law and a second on
his press relations.
   Here is a partial transcript of their replies:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. As president, what sort of tone would you set regarding
openness in government, access to government information and
freedom of information?
   A. Within the limits of national security, government should be
open to scrutiny by the media and the public. Ours is a democracy
where goverment must be accountable to the people. The
information-gathering process, from a news conference to the
Freedom of Information Act, is vital and essential to our system of
democracy.
   Q. What kind of relationship do you think you've had with the
media during your public career? How would you seek to improve it,
if at all?
   A. I think I have had a good relationship with the media. As
president, I hope that I will be able to spend more time talking
with smaller groups of reporters. I enjoy a good give and take, and
that kind of format allows me to get to know reporters a little
better and them to know me. Not only will this benefit reporters
but, more importantly, such free exchange will ultimately benefit
the general public as well.
   Q. Throughout history, presidents have had a variety of
relationships with the media. Are there any styles you would
emulate? Are there any you would avoid? When it comes time to write
the history of your relations with the media, what will it say?
   A. With the media, the Congress or the public, it would be a
mistake to attempt to be something or someone you're not. So, warts
and all, what you see is what you'll get.
   I hope words like ``accessible,'' ``candid,'' ``honest'' and
``fair'' will be adjectives used to describe my relationship with
the media by historians. It certainly is what I will strive for
during my tenure as president. ...
   Q. How frequently would you meet with reporters? How would you
conduct press conferences? How often would you hold press
conferences? Would you make any changes in the way President Reagan
has done his press conferences?
   A. There are a number of ways to communicate with both the media
and the public. Press conferences are one important way and they
would certainly be central to my effort to ensure accessibility in
my administration. One-on-one and group interviews, satellite
interviews with regional media, national televised addresses are
other examples of methods that a president can and should use to
provide the media with opportunities to discuss administration
policies and programs.
   My goal would be to get the right ``mix'' of all of the options
available to guarantee an open administration. Realistically, you
can't put a number on any of the working parts of an open approach
to accessibility, but you can make and keep a commitment to the
goal itself.
   Q. More specifically, what message will you send to your
executive agencies regarding Freedom of Information requests?
   A. My message will be simple: obey the law. ...
   Q. Here's a chance to offer some contructive criticism. What
things would you most like to change about the news media? What
should the nation's media do differently to better serve the public
interest?
   A. Accuracy and fairness are the name of the game. The media
goes to great lengths to be accurate. It needs to go to the same
lengths to be fair. While it is often necessary to use unnamed
sources in gathering information for a story, it puts the validity
of a story at a disadvantage. I hope the news media would rely as
little as possible on this approach to information gathering and
reporting.

   Q. What sort of individual do you see putting in the job of
White House spokesperson? How much access would the spokesman have
to administration thinking and information? Do you condone Larry
Speakes' practice of manufacturing quotes?
   A. The job of White House press secretary is one of the toughest
in any administration and a number of qualities are important. A
press secretary must be honest, ethical, steady, candid with both
the media and the president and experienced, with an understanding
of the media and its needs. A sense of humor doesn't hurt either.
   If access is important to reporters, it is absolutely vital to a
press secretary. ... I understand that to function effectively a
press secretary must have a first-hand knowledge of a President's
policies and positions. ...
   Finally, on the third question: no.
   Q. How much access do you believe reporters ought to have to the
White House staff? How free would your staff be to talk on the
record to reporters?
   A. The Bush Administration will be an open one. That doesn't
mean every staff member will be authorized to serve as an
administration spokesman or interpreter of events and policies. The
best interests of the government, media and public aren't observed
by the confusion and misinformation that usually results from that
kind of policy.
   Not in every instance but in most, if something can't be said on
the record, it's probably better left unsaid. ...
   Q. What would be your policy on allowing media coverage of
military actions (a la Grenada)? Do you support the pool approach
worked out and used in the Persian Gulf exercises, or do you
believe reporters and photographers ought to have even freer access
to military operations?
   A. Certainly, the public has a right to know the details of
military operations in an appropriate time frame and in a way that
does not risk national security. The current relationship between
the military and the press is workable and I support it. But that
safety of the troops and the success of the mission must be
paramount, and I will risk neither.

<HEAD>MICHAEL DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Freedom of Information: For the past eight years, the
Reagan-Bush administration has waged an assault on the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) with every weapon in its arsenal _ executive
orders, budget cuts, fee guidelines and legislative proposals.
Their objective is clear: to gut a statute whose fundamental
premise is that American citizens have the right to know about the
activities of their own government.
   The current administration claims that complying with the FOIA
is too time-consuming, too expensive and too bothersome. These are
excuses for government secrecy. And they could serve as a cloak for
incompetence, mismanagement, illegality or corruption. ...
   As president, I will implement the FOIA in the spirit which
Congress intended. From Vietnam to Watergate to Iran-Contra, we
Americans have learned what happens when government operates in
secrecy, accountable to no one. A Dukakis administration will treat
requesters of information as clients, not as burdens. For only in
an atmosphere of the fullest possible disclosure can the American
people retain confidence in their government.
   Relations with the press: Throughout my public career I've
believed in a free press and my record shows I've practiced that
belief. As governor for nearly 10 years, I have been accessible to
State House reporters several times a week. I enjoy the spirited
give and take of news conferences and the vigorous exchange of an
interview. More important, I understand and appreciate the role of
the news media in a free society as laid out two centuries ago in
the Bill of Rights to the Constitution.
   As president, I would hope to continue this pattern of
accessibility to the White House press corps, giving them and me
the opportunity to utilize our First Amendment freedoms.

   The dispute between Iran and Iraq over
sovereignty of the palm-fringed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which
threatens to snarl their peace talks in Geneva, dates back more
than 400 years.
   Although Iran's Islamic Revolution was the catalyst for the
8-year-old Persian Gulf war, the battle for control of the
125-mile-long waterway was also one of the major causes.
   Over the last four centuries, the waterway has figured in at
least 25 wars.
   The Shatt, the traditional southern boundary between the two
ancient antagonists, is also the historical racial and religious
divide between the Arabs in the west and the Persians in the east
   They even call it by different names. To the Arabs, it's the
Shatt-al-Arab, or River of The Arabs, the name used on most maps.
To the Iranians, it's the Arvand Rud, or river.
   Iraq claims a 1975 agreement that put the border down the middle
of the waterway is null and void. Iran, which gained most from the
treaty, insists it is still valid.
   Apart from its political significance, the waterway, formed by
the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, is also
economically important to both countries, particularly Iraq.
   The Shatt is Iraq's only outlet to the gulf. West of the Shatt's
estuary, it only has 10 miles of coastline.
   Its major port of Basra, heavily damaged during the war and
closed since the start of the conflict, depends for its existence
on the Shatt.
   Iran has a 1,400-mile coastline, running all the way down the
gulf to the Arabian Sea. But it needs the Shatt for its oil export
route from Abadan.
   Its big port of Khorammshahr, north of Abadan, also lies on the
waterway, as does the Iranian naval base at Khosrowabad. The Kharg
Island oil terminal, through which 90 percent of Iran's oil exports
passes, lies only 30 miles south of the Shatt estuary.
   The economic importance of the waterway for Tehran diminished
during the war, when the Iranians boosted trade and oil exports
through other gulf ports and installations.
   The sovereignty dispute has spawned at least 20 often ambigious
treaties since 1847 that did little to settle it.
   Lord Palmerston, Britain's prime minister from 1855 to 1865,
considered the problem was so complex that only the superpowers of
the day, Britain and Russia, could solve it by arbitrarily imposing
a settlement.
   The earliest specific boundary agreement to have a historical
validity was the Treaty of Erzerum, signed in 1847, which gave
control of the Shatt to the Ottomans.
   The British and Russians helped arrange another border pact in
Constantinople in 1913, which upheld the principle of freedom of
navigation by all nations, but drew the boundary down the eastern,
Iranian bank.
   Iraq, which emerged from the breakup of the Ottoman Empire in
1918, based its subsequent claims of sovereignty on that 1913
accord.
   The Iranians, moving into the modern age under Shah Reza
Pahlavi, flexed their muscles by disputing the status quo. They
rejected the 1847 treaty and demanded that the boundary lay down
the middle of the waterway.
   A 1937 treaty confirmed Iraqi sovereignty. Although the Iranians
got some territorial concessions, the treaty rankled them for the
next three decades.
   In 1960, the Iranians appointed their own river pilots. Iraq
retaliated by forcing the closure of Abadan, by then a vital oil
outlet.
   But in 1969, as the shah built up Iran's navy in his drive to
make Iran the dominant power in the gulf, he abrogated the 1937
treaty and sent his gunboats into the waterway.
   He also backed Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq in their war
against Baghdad for an autonomous homeland.
   The rebellion seriously weakened the Iraqi government and in
March 1975, then-vice president Saddam Hussein was forced to sign
the Algiers Treaty in 1975 with the shah.
   Iraq conceded the border ran down the deep-water channel in the
middle of the Shatt. In return, Iran cut off aid to the Kurds.
   Saddam considered the loss of Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt a
humiliation. On Sept, 17, 1980, amid border skirmishes with the new
fundamentalist regime in Tehran, Saddam, by then Iraq's president,
ripped up the treaty. Five days later he invaded Iran.

   Protesters stoned the motorcade of
President Augusto Pinochet Sunday during a campaign tour on the
15th anniversary of the military coup he led that ousted the
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende.
   In the coastal resort of Vina del Mar, thousands of leftists
battled riot police following a memorial service at the grave of
Allende, who perished in the coup.
   Witnesses said at four protesters suffered bullet wounds when
Pinochet's bodyguards opened fire after the president's motorcade
was stoned in Cerro Navia, a working-class suburb north of Santiato.
   Police did not report any injuries or arrests in Cerro Navia but
said 142 people were arrested in Vina del Mar when militants tried
to march from the cemetery into the city center.
   Pinochet, the only candidate in next month's presidential
referendum, was booed by hundreds of people when he arrived in
Cerro Navia.
   Many hurled rocks at his motorcade, according to Radio
Cooperativa. The broadcast said Pinochet's bodyguards fired shots
into the air and vehicles in the motorcade drove around barricades
of burning tires.
   Radio Cooperativa said no one was seriously hurt but some people
were hit by rocks and had minor injuries.
   Reporters at the scene said four people were struck by bullets
and two, Manuel Romero and Orieta Valvez, were in serious condition
with stomach wounds.
   Earlier Sunday, in a speech marking the Sept. 11,1973, overthrow
of Allende, Pinochet addressed an audience of 3,000 people in a
government office building. Among those present were Pinochet's
fellow armed forces commanders and the 16-member Cabinet.
   ``We will triumph in the upcoming challenge,'' the 72-year-old
president said.
   Outside, thousands of supporters rallied noisily on the street.
They waved red, white and blue Chilean flags and banners promoting
a ``Yes'' vote in the referendum.
   An estimated 5,000 people attended the memorial service for
Allende in Vina del Mar, 75 northwest of Santiago.
   After the service, thousands of leftists began a march from the
suburban cemetery to the downtown area and were blocked by helmeted
riot police. Fighting broke out about five blocks from the cemetery
and police used tear gas, clubs and water cannon to disperse the
demonstrators but running street battles continued for nearly three
hours.
   Reporters said several people were arrested and some
demonstrators were injured but no figures were given by police.
   In his speech, Pinochet indicated the estimated 300 foreign
observers expected to observe the presidential plebiscite might get
a cool reception. ``We forcefully repudiate those foreigners who
try to intervene in our internal affairs,'' he said.
   ``In the plebiscite, we will give the world a new lesson in
democracy,'' he said.
   Pinochet, in military uniform with the presidential sash across
his chest, spoke in his yearly state-of-the-nation address on the
anniversary of the coup.
   ``I am ready to give the last breath of life to my country,'' he
said.
   If the voters approve the referendum Pinochet will remain as
president until 1997.
   Pinochet boasted of social and economic achievements by his
administration but added: ``Despite the spectacular advances
achieved, there's much left to do.''
   In a bid for votes, Pinochet announced special bonuses for
public employees and retirees. No details were given.
   The Retirees' Party, an association of pensioners opposed to
Pinochet, called the bonus offer a scheme for votes.
   ``You can't buy consciences with money,'' said the party's
president, Juan Torres.
   Shortly before the president arrived at the government building
for his speech, police bomb experts were summoned to deactivate a
device from a car authorities said contained 155 pounds of
explosives. The car was parked across the street from the main
entrance to the building.
   An anonymous caller told a foreign news agency by telephone the
car contained explosives. He did not identify himself as belonging
to any particular group.
   A police communique said: ``The explosion would have caused
numerous deaths and injuries among the multitude awaiting the
president's arrival.''
   In the Oct. 5 vote, Chileans will decide if Pinochet will
receive an eight-year term in March. If a majority rejects the
proposal open elections will be held in one year and Pinochet will
hand power over to the winner in 1990.
   Win or lose, congressional elections will be held in 1990 for
the first time since the legislature was disbanded aftert the coup.
But Congress will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980
Constitution that gives the military autonomy and a powerful
supervisory role in national affairs.
   In his 55-minute speech, Pinochet said his new government would
be democratic while providing safeguards against international
Marxism, which he said had subjected the country to ``a constant
and indiscriminate agression.''
   The government has said it will not recognize foreigners who
come to observe the vote. A group of ex-congressmen opposed to
Pinochet has said it expects at least 300 foreigners, many of them
officials in their countries, to come as observers.

<HEAD>Textile Forces Fight Mopping Up Action on Import Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate supporters of the textile and apparel
industries are going into this week determined to break their
opponents' grip on import restraint legislation and send the bill
to the House once and for all.
   ``Business is business,'' Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
declared Friday as the Senate approved the bill 57-32. ``Business
is not fair. It's no use crying and moaning about fairness. We've
got to do something.''
   The bill, designed to limit foreign competition to selected U.S.
industries, would freeze this year's textile and apparel imports at
1987 levels and limit growth to 1 percent annually from then on.
   Imports of nonrubber footwear would be capped at 1987 levels
with no increases in market share for foreign manufacturers allowed.
   Supporters say it would save American jobs while critics counter
that it would raise prices, narrow consumer choices and throw a
wrench into the gears of international trade.
   The House also plans action this week on the drug issue,
including debate on proposals to fine users $10,000 and prod states
to cancel their driver's licenses. The Senate, meanwhile, must
decide what to do with a $140 billion social programs spending bill
that has become snarled in the abortion issue.
   The Reagan administration is vowing an all-out effort to block
the textile bill, even if it means an election-eve battle to
sustain a presidential veto.
   Opponents of the bill managed to keep it bottled up in the
Senate over the weekend, even though it already has won approval.
   A second vote is needed to send the measure to the House, which
already has passed a similar bill and must now vote upon Senate
changes in the legislation.
   The opponents threatened to filibuster the second vote and it
appeared that the Senate would not be able to wash its hands of the
bill until Tuesday or even later. But there is no question that
supporters will eventually get the bill to the House and this
week's dispute mainly represents a mopping up action.
   The drug bill before the House would add another $2 billion on
top of the $3.9 billion now being spent annually by the federal
government on anti-drug efforts. In addition to debating whether to
penalize drug users, the House will try to decide whether to keep
in the bill a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers.
   An amendment being offered by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., would
drop the waiting period in favor of a voluntary system under which
dealers could check by phone or other means on whether a would-be
gun buyer had ever been convicted of a felony.
   The drug bill appears headed for a vote Thursday or Friday.
   Those favoring a harsh crackdown succeeded last week in
attaching provisions calling for a federal death penalty, no
government benefits for twice-convicted users and court use of
evidence seized illegally if police obtained it while acting ``in
good faith.''
   This week, Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., will propose civil
penalties of up to $10,000 per violation against those possessing
even small ``personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine, and
other drugs.
   Rep. Glenn M. Anderson, D-Calif., is pushing a proposal to
provide up to $125 million over three years to states that order
drivers license suspensions or revocations for convicted drug
users. McCollum has a variant that would dock states some of their
federal highway money unless they adopted the penalty.
   Senators passed the social spending bill with an expansion of
the Medicaid program to cover abortions for rape and incest
victims. But the House on Friday refused to accept that provision
in the Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services spending
bill.
   The House this week also is expected to pass an insider trading
bill that, for the first time, would clear the way for fining
securities firms for violations committed by their employees.
   Maximum jail terms for insider trading would be increased from
five to 10 years, and maximum criminal fines would go from $500,00
to $2.5 million per violation for companies; and from $100,000 to
$1 million for individuals.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans a vote Wednesday on
a bill that would impose harsh sanctions on South Africa.
   Similar to a House-passed bill, it would end virtually all U.S.
investment in South Africa and trade with that country because of
its apartheid policy of racial segregation. But prospects for the
measure on the Senate floor appear dim, with only a few weeks
remaining before adjournment.

<HEAD>Colleges Losing Interest in Humanities, But The Public's Not</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colleges and universities are losing interest
in literature, language and history but Americans are showing a
``remarkable blossoming'' of interest in cultural events, spending
more money on them than on sports events, a government report says.
   The report by Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities, says the high cost of education may
be causing more students to avoid liberal arts subjects in favor of
courses that will give them a money-making career.
   While the number of bachelor's degrees awarded increased 88
percent in the past two decades, degrees in the humanities dropped
33 percent, said her report released Sunday. Foreign language
majors were down 29 percent, English majors 33 percent, philosophy
majors 35 percent and history majors 43 percent, it said.
   The 73-page report ordered by Congress says too many colleges
are neglecting the achievements of Western culture while requiring
ethnic courses, treating literary masterpieces as political
documents, stressing publishing rather than teaching, and dealing
in topics so specialized that they have little meaning outside the
academic world.
   The report says museums, libraries, educational TV stations,
state humanities councils and private historical societies provide
so much education that they have become ``a kind of parallel
school,'' reaching millions of people outside college campuses.
   ``The remarkable blossoming of the humanities in the public
sphere is one of the least noted, though most important, cultural
developments of the last few decades,'' writes Mrs. Cheney.
   The $140 million endowment she has headed since May 1986
provides grants to scholars, colleges, museums, libraries and other
institutions to promote the humanities.
   Citing a variety of sources, the report gives several examples
of increased public interest in the humanities, including record
high book sales, a doubling of the number of historical
organizations in 20 years to nearly 10,000, and a 660 percent
increase in visitors to the National Gallery of Art in Washington
since 1957.
   Americans who spent twice as much on sports events as on
cultural endeavors 20 years ago are now spending more on culture _
$3.4 billion compared with $3.1 billion for sports in 1986, said a
news release accompanying the report. It gave no details on how the
figures were obtained or what cultural events were included.
   The report says that while some have argued that television is
the enemy of books, people are actually both watching television
and reading, with book sales up 400 percent since television was
rare 40 years ago.
   Mrs. Cheney credits television with increasing the sale of some
books which have been the basis for popular dramas or subjects of
discussion on educational television shows.
   In assessing the academic approach to the humanities, the report
says: ``Viewing humanities texts as though they were primarily
political documents is the most noticeable trend in academic study
of the humanities today. Truth and beauty and excellence are
regarded as irrelevant; questions of intellectual aesthetic
quality, dismissed.''
   The report says Western tradition is rich and creative, but many
colleges are abandoning courses that teach it.
   The report says a course in great Western literature is under
attack at Columbia University in New York, while Mount Holyoke
College in Massachusetts and the University of Wisconsin at Madison
require ethnic or Third World courses but have no Western
civilization requirements.
   ``The humanities are about more than politics, about more than
social power,'' the report says. ``What gives them their abiding
worth are truths that pass beyond time and circumstance; truths
that, transcending accidents of class, race, and gender, speak to
us all.''
   The report, ``Humanities in America,'' resulted from several
meetings of advisory panels and regional groups formed by the
endowment. It follows a 1986 report, ``American Memory,'' which
detailed how little high school students know about Western
history, literature and culture.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Bush, Dukakis Take Opposite Stands on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to abortion, George Bush and
Michael Dukakis agree on one thing: each man says he personally
does not favor the controversial procedure.
   But beyond their personal feelings, the Republican and
Democratic presidential nominees have staked out opposite stands on
whether abortion should be legal and whether the government should
pay for the operation for poor women.
   Bush favors a constitutional amendment to overturn the 1973
Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, that legalized abortion. He
favors outlawing all abortions except in cases of rape, incest or
to save the life of the mother. He opposes Medicaid funding of
abortions for poor women except to save the woman's life.
   Dukakis, as a legislator and governor of Massachusetts, has been
a resolute supporter of women's legal right to choose abortion, as
well as government-funding of the operation for the poor.
   Anti-abortion pickets are a common sight at rallies for Dukakis
and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, just as they
hounded the Democrats' ticket of Walter Mondale and Geraldine
Ferraro in 1984.
   Prior to becoming Ronald Reagan's running mate in 1980, Bush
opposed a constitutional amendment to overturn legalized abortion.
He once supported federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or
incest, as well as to save the mother's life.
   Asked in 1984 why he changed his position, Bush replied: ``There
has been _ I have to make a confession _ an evolution in my
position. There's been 15 million abortions since 1973, and I don't
take that lightly.''
   While Bush has altered his stand on the issue, others in the
Republican Party remain pro-choice, including the vice president's
campaign co-chairman, Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill. Recently, Bush said
his opposition to abortion is not a stand that he expects everyone
in his party has to share.
   Questioned about Martin's position during a campaign stop in
Illinois on Friday, Bush said, ``I have a lot of key supporters who
agree with Lynn and a lot that agree with me.'' He added: ``Who's
going to have a litmus test that everybody has to agree with
everybody on every single issue?''
   Asked about the hardline stand against abortion in the
Republican platform, Bush said, ``The platform states the position
of the platform but nobody in our party takes a litmus test that
says that everybody has to agree on every issue. I expect the
Democrats could say the same thing.''
   Dukakis has been called ``a pro-abortion zealot'' by Dr. J.C.
Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee. The
group's legislative director, Douglas Johnson, said, ``Dukakis says
he's personally opposed, but he wants to subsidize it on demand.''
   He pointed to Dukakis' sponsoring of a bill in 1970 to legalize
abortion in Massachusetts, and later, as governor, his vetoes of
several bills with restrictions on abortion funding.
   Facing a strident anti-abortion protest in a Chicago suburb
Tuesday, Dukakis said: ``While I don't favor abortion or think it's
a good thing, I happen to think that in the last analysis it's up
to the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious
beliefs, to make that decision.''
   ``We should not brand women as criminals for making that
decision. I think that's what most Americans believe, and it's
certainly what the Supreme Court has held,'' said Dukakis.
   Bush, in his acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans Aug. 18, said, ``Is it right to believe
in the sanctity of life and protect the lives of innocent children?
My opponent says no _ but I say yes. ... We've got to change from
abortion to adoption.''
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said, ``There is a stark, stark difference
between the two candidates'' and between the two parties' platforms
on abortion.
   The Democrats' terse platform, without mentioning the word
abortion, says, ``the right of reproductive choice should be
guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.''
   The GOP platform contains anti-abortion language in several
sections, including a plank that declares: ``the unborn child has a
fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.''
It endorses both a human life amendment and legislation to extend
the 14th Amendment's protections to the unborn.
   Bentsen has said he, too, personally opposes abortion and does
not favor federal funding except in cases of rape, incest or to
save the mother's life. But the National Right to Life Committee
and the National Abortion Rights Action League both agree that
Bentsen has usually voted against restrictions on abortion funding
and against constitutional amendments to ban abortion.
   Bentsen was absent July 27 when the Senate voted 73-19 to allow
Medicaid funding of abortions in promptly reported cases of rape or
incest.
   The House, on a 216-166 vote Friday, refused to go along with
the Senate move, which would be the first liberalization of
Medicaid abortion funding in seven years. The Senate may take up
the issue early this week.
   Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, voted with that
Senate majority July 27. But NARAL says he was among ``many
anti-choice senators'' who voted for the amendment only as an
alternative to accepting even fewer restrictions on Medicaid
funding.
   Quayle is rated highly by the anti-abortion groups and lowly by
NARAL. Quayle says he generally opposes abortion except to save the
mother's life.
   Activists on both sides agree the next president is likely to
make several appointments to the Supreme Court that could sway the
tribunal's ruling on abortion.
   The current court has four justices who generally support the
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, four who have been critical of it and
one _ the newest member, Anthony Kennedy _ whose views are not yet
clear.
   ``My biggest concern is the next president's role in appointing
at least three Supreme Court justices, if not more,'' said
Michelman, whose organization helped defeat President Reagan's
nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Bork had criticized
Roe vs. Wade.
   Johnson said, ``On Inauguration Day next January, there'll be
three pro-abortion justices over 80 years of age.''
   A human life amendment is ``a long ways down the road,'' he
said, but if the Democrats capture the White House, ``Dukakis could
appoint a pro-abortion majority for years to come.''

   Firefighters failed in their first
attempt to cap a burning oil well Sunday after draining thousands
of gallons of oil from storage tanks near the blaze, a spokeswoman
said.
   Another attempt to cap the well was planned for Monday, said
Ventura County fire dispatcher CeCe Grives.
   An attempt to flood the well with saltwater failed when a crack
was found in a pipe on the oil rig, she said.
   Draining oil from 11 storage tanks in the vicinity of the
inferno was a pressing concern soon after the fire began Thursday.
Each tank holds about 33,600 gallons, county authorities said.
   One man was burned and $5 million worth of drilling equipment
was destroyed when the well ignited at a Seneca Corp. oil field in
Los Padres National Forest.
   The blaze apparently began when a spark from an electric fan
ignited fumes, officials said.
   Oil field worker John Henry, 24, was in serious but stable
condition Sunday evening at Sherman Oaks Burn Center with burns
over 50 percent of his body.
   Oil rig firefighter Coots Matthews, whose Houston-based firm,
Boots & Coots Inc., was called to extinguish the blaze, has said
the effort would probably take a week.
   The fire burned at the southern end of the national forest,
which reaches into five Southern California counties.

   Cartoonist Gary Larson will give his pen
a rest this fall to take a 14-month break from creating ``The Far

   Larson, 38, who lives in Seattle, will stop distributing new
cartoons Oct. 30 and will begin again Jan. 1, 1990.
   ``Even revolutionaries need to refuel,'' said John McMeel,
president of Universal Press Syndicate, which distributes Larson's
cartoons to more than 800 newspapers.
   Larson, who says he sits down at his drawing table and ``gets

dinosaurs that smoke and women with beehive hairdos.
   During Larson's hiatus, Universal Press will distribute more
than 1,000 cartoons he drew in the early 1980s that were published
in about 30 newspapers, McMeel said Saturday.

   Paramount Pictures, responding to
criticism from Portugese-Americans about its new movie ``The
Accused,'' starring Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis, says the film
is not based on the Big Dan's gang rape case.
   Portuguese-Americans have said ``The Accused'' will open old
wounds stemming from the barroom rape here.
   The movie shot in Vancouver, Canada, contains a barroom rape
scene, but does not portray Portuguese-Americans or any other
ethnic group as committing the rape, said Paramount spokeswoman
Jane Lanouette.
   The movie is not set in Massachusetts and is not based on the
Big Dan's case, Lanouette said.
   The disclaimer followed reports that the movie was based on the
March 1983 gang rape at Big Dan's tavern in a section of New
Bedford heavily populated by Portugese-Americans. The case drew
national attention.
   Six men, all of Portuguese descent, were charged in the case.
Four were convicted and two were acquitted.

   Dustin Hoffman, who plays an autistic
man in his latest film, ``Rainman,'' will attend a premiere here to
benefit a local autism center.
   ``It's extremely gratifying for a person of his stature to pay
attention to a very unusual population of people,'' said Ruth
Sullivan, director of Huntington's Autism Services Center.
   The actor befriended Mrs. Sullivan's 28-year-old autistic son,
Joseph, as he prepared for his role.
   Autism is a communication and behavior disorder characterized by
impaired speech and an unresponsiveness to other people.
   In ``Rainman,'' which co-stars Tom Cruise, Hoffman plays Raymond
Babbitt, an autistic man who inherits $3 million from his father.
Cruise plays his brother, who tries to trick Babbitt out of the
money.
   Barry Levinson, whose films include ``Diner,'' ``The Natural''
and ``Tin Men,'' directed the United Artists production, set for

   The recent releases ``Moonstruck,'' which won Academy Awards for
actresses Cher and Olympia Dukakis, ``Willow,'' and ``A Fish Called
Wanda'' leave MGM ``in the best shape its has been in the past
several years,'' Ladd said.
   ``We regret his departure,'' said MGM-UA Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Stephen D. Silbert.

<HEAD>Drought-related River Traffic Losses Pegged at $200 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary review by the Agriculture
Department of this summer's barge traffic on drought-reduced rivers
shows some of the huge problems that have plagued the movement of
grain from inland farm points into export shipping channels.
   In mid-June, low water levels on the lower Mississippi and Ohio
rivers began to stall barges at choke points for more than a day.
By the end of the month stoppages were a regular occurrence.
   ``Reduced load size, smaller tows and lengthened transit times
have dropped the capacity of the Mississippi River system by at
least 50 percent,'' the report said. ``Difficult navigation and
increased travel time add to costs, especially for fuel and labor
which normally account for about 35 percent of total operating
costs.''
   Overall, according to a recent industry study, barge operators
could lose as much as $200 million this year.
   The smaller river flow forced gyrations in barge rates, the
report said. Even before the drought's full effect, rates were
going higher because of greater demand. In the first five months,
they averaged nearly a fourth more than in the same January-May
period of 1987.
   In the first two weeks of June, barge rates jumped 4 percent
from the end of May. By the end of June, rates had nearly tripled.
   ``This increase was short-lived,'' the report said. ``In the
first week of July, rates fell to about 125 percent above the end
of May, and by month's end had returned to pre-drought levels.''
   By the first week of August, rates from Peoria, Ill., to export
points at New Orleans, La., averaged $6.85 per ton, up 12 percent
from a year earlier.
   ``The decline in rates after the first week of July resulted
from a sharp reduction in demand for barge service,'' the report
said. ``As export volume shrank and producers held stocks in
anticipation of higher prices, shipments of grain and soybeans in
June fell 16 percent from May, and in July dropped 37 percent from
May.''
   According to the new outlook report by the department's Economic
Research Service, the higher transportation costs and reduced
capacity sharply boosted prices of corn delivered by barge to
Louisiana's Gulf ports.
   Between June 17 and June 23, corn prices rose from $3.31 to
$3.32 per bushel to a range of $3.63 to $3.66 per bushel, the
report said.
   ``These ports account for about 50 percent of U.S. grain exports
and receive 70 percent of the grain, chiefly corn, by barge,'' the
report said. ``Similar price increases are anticipated in the
poultry producing areas of the Southeast. Barges normally carry
about a third of the grain shipped to these states.''
   Trucks are not an alternative to barges for moving grain, the
report said. A fully loaded barge holds 1,500 tons of grain, or
about 35 truck loads. A mile-long truck convoy, bumper-to-bumper,
would replace fewer than 2{ barges.
   ``One day, 1,760 barges were stacked above Greenville, Miss.,
287 miles from New Orleans,'' the report said. ``Grain in these
barges would have filled a line of trucks 755 miles long.''

   A forecast by the Agriculture Department that
the cash receipts of farmers are likely to increase this year
despite huge production losses due to drought has put economists to
work explaining why.
   Cash receipts, or the gross from sales of crops and livestock,
are expected to rise $5 billion to $9 billion this year from 1987,
says the department's Economic Research Service. In 1980, another
drought year, farm cash receipts climbed nearly $8 billion.
   Since droughts have an impact on production, why don't cash
receipts decline?
   ``One reason is that the prices of drought-affected commodities
tend to increase more than production falls, raising the total
value of the crop,'' the agency says in a new outlook report.
``Another reason is that marketing does not drop as much as
production because stocks (inventories) are sold to make up the
harvest shortfall.''
   The economists say the demand for farm commodities is inelastic,
meaning that a 1 percent decline in production, for example, leads
to a price increase greater than 1 percent.
   ``Some farmers may benefit from the higher prices _ those in
areas with adequate rainfall, those who irrigate and those with
large unsold stocks of previous years' crops,'' the report said.
``However, higher cash receipts (nationally) do not imply that all
farmers are better off because of the drought.''
   The report added: ``Many farmers will suffer large declines in
cash receipts if their individual production falls by much more
than prices rise. Farmers in drought-stricken areas without large
stocks of unsold crops from previous years have little to fall back
on.''

   Honey bees are famous for pollinating crops,
but an Agriculture Department scientist says the bees don't work
hard enough when it comes to hybrid cotton plants.
   Gerald M. Loper, a plant physiologist at the Carl Hayden Bee
Research Center, Tucson, Ariz., said there's something about cotton
pollen that bees don't like.
   ``They will spend 20 minutes meticulously combing the pollen off
their bodies before returning to their hives,'' he said. And that's
time lost from their ``job'' of pollinating cotton plants.
   Bees are needed to pollinate hybrid strains of cotton by
carrying pollen from male to female plants, which produce the
hybrid seed. Regular cotton does its own pollinating without the
help of bees.
   The hybrid strains have a potential for boosting cotton yields
by as much as 25 percent and producing long fiber for specialty
markets, Loper said in a recent report. If only the bees would work
harder.
   India and Mexico grow hybrid cotton but rely on hand labor for
pollination to produce seeds. Labor costs and import restrictions
on foreign cotton seed have put pressure on the honey bee to do the
job in the United States, Loper said.

<HEAD>Legal Opinion Notwithstanding, Changes Still Years Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Drug Enforcement Administration official
created a stir last week with a formal recommendation to his agency
chief that marijuana be made legal for limited medical uses, but
any changes are still years away.
   The opinion by administrative law judge Francis L. Young
amounted to a ringing endorsement of certain benefits from smoking
pot _ mainly to help cancer patients tolerate highly toxic
chemotherapy.
   Moreover, he concluded that federal law gives officials no
choice but to change the way they classify the ancient weed. To do
otherwise, he wrote, would be to act in an ``unreasonable,
arbitrary and capricious'' manner.
   That is the legal jargon for the criterion courts use to decide
whether administrators are acting within the laws they administer
or are imposing their own desires.
   At the same time, however, Young's decision took tacit note of
political realities that left even those strongly favoring his
position doubtful that changes are likely for several years.
   Laurence O. McKinney, president of a small company called
Cannabis Corp. of America in Cambridge, Mass., and a petitioner in
the case, was jubilant with the decision because he believes there
will be an eventual financial bonanza for his company.
   The key word is eventual.
   McKinney said in a telephone interview that he is not optimistic
the DEA administrator will accept the law judge's finding and
predicted it will take at least two years before he and other
petitioners can get federal courts to order the finding implemented.
   Then, he acknowledged, the matter would have to go to the Food
and Drug Administration, a process he said probably would take at
least two more years.
   There would be a certain irony in the FDA being instructed by
courts to deal with marijuana.
   Young noted in his opinion that the agency ``is looking at a
synthetically formed new drug'' when it operates under the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that gives it regulatory authority.
   ``The marijuana plant is anything but a new drug,'' Young wrote.
``Uncontroverted evidence in this record indicates that marijuana
was being used therapeutically by mankind 2,000 years before the
birth of Christ.''
   To say it would be a voyage in uncharted regulatory waters for
the FDA to regulate marijuana would be an understatement. The
question is not before the agency now and efforts to get three
separate and normally helpful FDA officials to discuss the issue _
even informally _ were unsuccessful.
   Young noted in his decision that the question is politically
touchy.
   ``The judge realizes that strong emotions are aroused on both
sides of any discussion concerning the use of marijuana,'' Young
wrote. ``Nonetheless, it is essential for this agency, and its
administrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of
record, correctly apply the law, and act accordingly.''
   He continued: ``There are those who, in all sincerity, argue
that the transfer of marijuana to Schedule II will `send a signal'
that marijuana is `OK' generally for recreational use. This
argument is specious. It presents no valid reason for refraining
from taking an action required by law in light of the evidence.''
   And the evidence, he said, clearly shows that smoking marijuana
helps many cancer patients tolerate their treatment.
   His recommendation is that marijuana be moved from Schedule I _
strictly illegal except in research _ to Schedule II, whereby it
could be prescribed by physicians but only under the same tightly
controlled conditions that apply to such drugs as morphine and
cocaine.
   His 69-page opinion, summing up a 15-volume record, is replete
with testimony from physicians, patients and relatives that
marijuana counters the nausea and vomiting that can be so severe in
some patients it causes them to abandon potentially live-saving
treatment.
   Young concluded that marijuana cigarettes are superior in many
cases to synthetic capsules containing the active chemical present
in the plant. ``Attempting to orally administer the synthetic THC
capsule to a vomiting patient presents obvious problems,'' he said.
``It is vomited right back up before it can have any effect.''
   Having concluded that the marijuana plant meets the first
criterion of having a legitimate medical use, Young went on to
address safety issues.
   ``In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods
we commonly consume,'' he said. ``For example, eating 10 raw
potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is
physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.''

<HEAD>Insider Trading Charges Prompt Legislation Push in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest allegations of wrongdoing on Wall
Street are boosting efforts in the House to toughen penalties for
insider trading, but the Senate's desire to see an unrelated
banking law enacted could derail the effort.
   The House is scheduled to begin debate Tuesday and vote
Wednesday on an insider trading bill sponsored by Reps. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., and John D. Dingell, D-Mich. It would double the
maximum jail term for criminal convictions on insider trading
charges and increase fines fivefold for firms and tenfold for
individuals.
   Markey, at a meeting Friday of his Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on finance, predicted that the filing of government
charges earlier in the week against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
would prod Congress to quick action.
   Drexel and the chief of its junk bond unit, Michael Milken, are
named by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a wide-ranging
civil complaint alleging insider trading, fraud and other
violations.
   ``These allegations should propel insider trading reforms ...
into law by the end of this year,'' Markey said. ``We will not
permit the rich and greedy to treat our nation's financial markets
as little toys to be played with and manipulated for private
amusement and profiteering.''
   The legislation passed the Energy and Commerce Committee a month
ago. Many in the Senate also favor it, but the bill faces an
uncertain future there.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., in a
telephone interview Friday, raised the possibility of linking
Senate passage of the insider trading legislation to House action
on a Senate-passed bill giving banks new powers to underwrite
securities.
   Proxmire said he is conferring with other senators on his
committee and has made no decision about linkage, but added, ``We
want to hold all our options open.''
   The banking bill, which passed the Senate on a 94-2 vote more
than five months ago, would be the most comprehensive restructuring
of the financial system since the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act
barred banks from most securities business.
   A bill much less favorable to banks than the Senate measure
passed the House Banking Committee earlier this summer on a 31-20
vote and must go through Dingell's committee before it gets to the
House floor.
   Dingell, in an interview broadcast Sunday by ABC News ``Business
World,'' predicted insider trading legislation would pass Congress
this year, but said of the banking bill, ``That's going to take
longer if I have any say.''
   However, Proxmire argues that linking the banking bill to the
insider trading measure would enhance the chances of both passing
before Congress adjourns early next month.
   ``I think they should help each other,'' he said. ``There's no
reason why a (banking) bill with strong support in the Senate and
in the House Banking Committee will not bring strong support to
insider trading legislation.''
   The House insider trading bill would:
   _Increase the maximum jail term for criminal insider trading
from five years to 10 years.
   _Boost the maximum criminal fine from $500,000 for firms and
$100,000 for individuals to $2.5 million for firms and $1 million
for individuals.
   _Make it possible for securities firms to be fined for
violations by their employees in cases where the firm ``knew or
recklessly disregarded'' the facts.
   _Authorize the SEC to pay a bounty to whistle-blowers who give
information to authorities.
   _Give investors who lost money by trading in the same securities
as insider traders the right to sue inside traders for damages.
   _Grant new powers to the SEC to cooperate with foreign countries
investigating insider trading cases that involve U.S. citizens. The
idea is to encourage other nations to grant similar reciprocal aid
to the SEC.
   Late in July, the Senate Banking Committee passed much narrower
insider trading legislation including only the provisions on
international cooperation.
   Last September, as part of a corporate takeover bill that failed
to get through the full Senate, the banking committee approved
increased fines and jail terms for insider trading.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush, Saying Reagan Isn't Scary, Spooked By
`Pig'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To George Bush, the current occupant of the
White House is blessed with ``a great sense of humor if you like
jokes and stuff.'' What's more, he's ``not scary.''
   That's how the Republican presidential nominee sized up
President Reagan during an impromptu lunch with two fifth graders
he plucked at random from a crowd at a downtown rally in Pekin, Ill.
   John Keene and Brent Chandler, both 10, were invited by the vice
president to dine with him at the Red Hen Restaurant. He ordered a
chicken sandwich for himself and hot dogs for his two young lunch
partners. Talk turned quickly to sports and politics.
   ``What's your opinion of the Olympics?'' Bush asked the two boys.
   Brent said he hoped to watch the games on television. Bush said
he had just been to a sendoff in Disneyland for U.S. Olympic
athletes headed for Seoul, Korea _ an event he said he enjoyed
immensely.
   Bush asked if either one lived on a farm.
   John said he did, one with horses and cows, and that in fact his
mother had just gotten a bad bruise in a riding accident on a
``really crazy horse.''
   She was ``very lucky'' the horse didn't fall on top of her, Bush
observed, recalling the rodeo accident that claimed the life of
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige in 1987.
   Brent then got his question in: ``What's the president like?''
   ``He's a good guy, he's got a sense of humor if you like jokes
and stuff. He's very, very nice, not scary, a guy you can talk
to,'' Bush said.
   ``Some guys you can relax with and some you can't,'' he added.
   But the two fifth graders themselves were anything but relaxed.
Not only were they eating lunch with the vice president in front of
an imposing troop of photographers and reporters, but so much time
had elapsed that they feared being stranded. They had come to town
on a school field trip.
   ``How will you get back?'' Bush himself wondered. ``I don't
know,'' John responded glumly.
   ``Somebody ought to tell them (the teachers) that they're
here,'' Bush told an aide.
   The veep assured the two boys he'd make sure they got home _
even if it meant taking them for a ride in his motorcade.
   However, classmates had been waiting outside the restaurant _
and gave the pair a hero's welcome.

   Another meal, another place.
   It was Los Angeles, the end of a day that began with a campaign
appearance at a fish packing plant in San Diego, and the vice
president was in a romantic mood as he dined alone with Barbara,
his wife of 43 years.
   ``I looked over at her and said, `Bar, you mean a lot to me.''
   To which, the vice president playfully told reporters traveling
with him on Air Force Two, Mrs. Bush responded: ``May I tell you
something?''
   ``I said, `anything.' She said, `Fish spilled on your red tie.'''
   ```Look, sweetie, 43 years, I'm talking emotion,''' Bush quoted
himself. ``We're talking family values here,'' Bush continued.
   ``There was an understanding between us at that very moment that
transcended the skeptical look on the waiter's face. It was a
special moment there.
   ``Once in a while you luck into something like that on the
campaign trail.''

   When Bush presided over the sendoff of U.S. Olympic athletes at
Disneyland, his staff took pains to make sure that the vice
president was not standing directly alongside Goofy, Mickey Mouse
or other well-recognizable Disney characters.
   They didn't want the inevitable photo of such a pairing to fall
into the wrong hands.
   When reporters observed to Bush that he appeared to be keeping
his distance from Mickey Mouse, the vice president responded: ``I
was only one down from the damn guy.''
   However, Bush said that he was rattled by one of the Three
Little Pigs. ``He just kept staring at me, with this expression,''
Bush said, making a funny face.
   ``My word of honor: I looked over there, and said, It's not the
mouse that's bothering me. And he (the pig) kept, he kept...His
expression never changed, never changed. Just stared at you all the
time.''

<HEAD>Fiftieth Anniversary of Long Island-New England Hurricane Disaster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   What may have been the worst natural disaster ever to strike the
nation's Northeast swept in unexpectedly a half-century ago this
month, a great hurricane that claimed as many as 700 lives by some
accounts.
   Born a few days earlier in a tropical depression, the great
storm roared out of the Atlantic on Sept. 21, 1938, crossed Long
Island leaving a swath of disaster and crashed north into New
England.
   The storm gave no warning, blasting a region where such weather
furies are rare and usually fairly weak by the time they arrive.
   Coming before the era of satellite observations and rapid
electronic communications, there was none of the advance notice so
common today.
   ``It was the worst natural disaster ever to strike the
northeastern United States,'' says weather historian David M.
Ludlum in the magazine Weatherwise.
   ``The storm snuffed out the lives of some 700 unsuspecting
people and injured thousands more. It destroyed or badly damaged
20,000 homes, summer cottages and farm buildings, as well as 26,000
cars and nearly 6,000 boats,'' Ludlum says.
   Historians knew of a major New England hurricane in 1815, but
since then the giant tropical storms had generally only brushed
that part of the nation, concentrating their fury on the South.
   So neither meteorologists nor residents of the region were
prepared for the speed, direction and intensity of the 1938 storm.
   ``Those of us who were in the 1938 hurricane remember how it
took us by surprise. Like the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it was
totally unexpected,'' reported Howard E. Smith Jr. in his book
``Killer Weather.''
   Like many tropical storms, this hurricane meandered near Florida
for several days before curving to the north, arriving off Cape
Hatteras, N.C. about 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 21.
   Suddenly, it set out on a speedy trip up the coast.
   To the north it was a warm, autumn day with no danger in the
forecast.
   The Weather Bureau in Washington issued a storm warning for the
Northeast at 10 a.m., but by then the hurricane was already surging
northward.
   Broadcast warnings were delayed in some areas because many radio
stations were carrying a live speech by German dictator Adolf
Hitler at the time.
   ``By 3:30 p.m. the whole force of the hurricane smashed against
Long Island, New York. The Empire State Building was lost to sight
as swirling, silver-sheeted clouds driven by 120 mile per hour
winds engulfed and swayed it to and fro,'' reported Jay Robert Nash
in the book ``Darkest Hours.''
   Wind gusts would be recorded at 186 miles per hour before the
storm was over. Along the island, beach houses of the rich and
famous collapsed and were swept away.
   After blasting clear large expanses of Long Island, the storm
surged across the narrow sound into Connecticut, then headed north
to batter Hartford, Springfield and even blast portions of Vermont
and upstate New York. Disastrous flooding was reported in central
Connecticut and Massachusetts.
   The worst damage was reported along the coasts, though, with
storm-whipped waves estimated at 20 to 30 feet in height. The
waters of Narragansett Bay were driven into Providence, bringing
normal life to a halt.
   Coming at a time of already high tide, the storm wiped out small
beach resorts in Connecticut and Rhode Island.
   ``What I saw that day will stay in my mind forever. Whenever
before I had looked at the horizon it had been a straight line. ...
Not that day. Gigantic waves moved along the horizon like the teeth
of some titanic chain saw,'' wrote Smith, who viewed the storm as a
youth in Rockport, Mass.
   Along the storm track whole groves of trees were mowed down by
the wind, an estimated 275 million trees being destroyed, according
to Ludlum. Heavy rains swept the land and power lines were down
nearly everywhere.
   ``By nightfall on this day of the autumn equinox, eastern Long
Island and practically all of New England with the exception of
Maine lay stunned from the hurricane's blow,'' Ludlum wrote.
   His estimate of 700 killed and 1,500 to 2,000 seriously injured
helps illustrate the confusion generated by the storm, for Nash
reports the fatalities at 494, plus 100 missing and never found;
while Smith estimates the dead at 680.
   Even with the better forecasting that today would give warning
of the storm's approach, the potential for disaster remains.
   ``If such a storm should hit today, losses could be much
higher,'' Ludlum warns.
   ``There has been a large increase in both summer and year-round
populations in these areas, while property values have risen
astronomically. This is particularly true along the shore. And
should a full-fledged hurricane hit during the vacation season,
when beaches and roads are packed, the potential for disaster would
be appalling.''

   Negotiators for George Bush and Michael
Dukakis have agreed to almost all provisions for the two debates
between the presidential candidates.
   A spokeswoman for the Dukakis campaign said talks will continue
this week over the only remaining question _ whether the candidates
will stand as Dukakis prefers or sit as Bush wants.
   Lorraine Voles, a spokeswoman for the Democratic nominee, said
final agreement on the length and format of the debates Sept. 25 in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 13 or 14 in Los Angeles were worked
out by telephone on Sunday.
   The debates will each last 90 minutes and feature one moderator
and a panel of three questioners, she said.
   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas and adviser Thomas
Donilon and Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker and media adviser
Roger Ailes also agreed that the candidates will make closing
statements instead of opening statements and that the candidates
will be allowed to take notes. However, Bush and Dukakis will not
be able to bring prepared notes to the debates.
   The two sides also agreed to allow the campaigns to use footage
from the debates in television commercials but the material cannot
be used out of context, said Voles.

   Cardinal John O'Connor, who has been the target
of protests by homosexuals, condemned recent attacks of gays as the
work of ``utterly stupid'' people.
   ``I wish I had language strong enough to condemn this kind of
cruelty,'' O'Connor said at St. Patrick's Cathedral before his
sermon Sunday.
   ``Anyone who performs such actions in the belief that he or she
is in some way helping society is utterly stupid,'' said the head
of the New York archdioces. ``Anyone who does such a thing thinking
it is justified by church teaching about homosexual behavior is
grossly ignorant of what the church actually teaches.''
   The cardinal specifically mentioned an Aug. 22 incident in which
two men walking on Manhattan's Upper West Side were surrounded and
beaten by a group of teen-age boys shouting anti-homosexual
epithets. One of the two men was stabbed three times and remains
hospitalized.
   ``These actions were so brutal that they could have resulted in
murder,'' O'Connor said.
   For more than a year, a group of gay Catholics has picketed
outside the cathedral once a month to protest what they see as
discrimination against homosexuals by the Roman Catholic church.
   The leader of one gay rights group _ Thomas B. Stoddard,
executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund _
on Sunday called O'Connor's statement, ``an important step
forward.''

<HEAD>Mountain Pine Beetle Cutting Deadly Swath Across The West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swarms of mountain pine beetles are cutting a
deadly swath through the West, creating fuel for forest fires as
they kill huge, dense plots of trees from Montana to New Mexico and
Colorado to California.
   The insect, about the size of a big pinhead, destroys about 2
million acres of timber a year nationwide.
   Last year it ravaged 2.4 million acres, with more than half of
that _ 1.4 million acres _ on the eastern side of the Cascade Range
in Oregon. The year before, 3.4 million acres were wiped out.
   By comparison, wildfires have consumed nearly 3.8 million acres
this year, an area larger than Connecticut.
   ``Basically, what we've had is a tidal wave rolling down to the
south,'' says Dave Bridgwater, an entomologist at the U.S. Forest
Service's regional office in Portland.
   The ``wave'' has been rolling through an area of lodgepole pine
on the eastern slope of the Cascades in central Oregon. Though it
prefers lodgepole, the beetle also attacks more valuable pine
species such as ponderosa, sugar, Western white and whitebark.
   The result is large parcels of dead trees that amount to a
tinderbox.
   About 4,000 acres of dead lodgepole helped fuel a fire that
consumed more than 11,000 acres in the Deschutes National Forest
this summer.
   Beetle-killed forest land also was a factor in the massive
forest fires in Yellowstone National Park, said Tom Hofacker, an
entomologist at the Forest Service's national headquarters in
Rosslyn, Va.
   ``The lodgepole pine forest is regenerated through these
fires,'' said Hofacker. ``In another 80 to 100 years it gets killed
again by the mountain pine beetle. Ten to 15 years after that the
trees start falling down, and the stage is set for another fire.''
   Russ Mitchell, an entomologist in Bend, uses a chisel designed
for cracking open human skulls on the autopsy table to dig into the
bark of lodgepole pines that are as good as dead.
   ``I wish I could talk to these things,'' he said, uncovering a
male beetle burrowing under the bark toward a female.
   Though the tree still looked green and healthy, it will be red
and dead by next spring, overwhelmed by hordes of insects and the
accompanying fungus that finishes off the trees.
   ``One tree will be selected by what you might call pioneer
beetles,'' said Mitchell. ``The females pick the tree out.''
   Trees weakened by a lack of water emit a gas that the beetles
can smell, Bridgwater said. The insects also are attracted to the
biggest trees in the area, leaving smaller trees alone.
   Once the beetle starts boring into bark, it puts out a
pheromone, or odor, that attracts other beetles.
   Thousands of beetles bore into the tree, enough to overcome the
tree's main line of defense, which is to push the beetles out with
heavy flows of sap.
   ``When the beetle has mated, it will begin to put out another
odor,'' said Mitchell. ``It says, `This place is full.'''
   Beetles will move on to another tree. Within three years, they
can move through an entire stand.
   What actually kills the trees is the fungus, whose spores ride
along on the beetle's back.
   Researchers are looking at pheromones as a way of managing the
beetles, Mitchell said.
   Packets of the ``this place is full'' pheromone could be tacked
up to protect trees in campgrounds and seed orchards, and packets
of the ``come on in'' pheromone could be placed nearby in a stand
slated for logging, he said.
   Besides firewood, the dead lodgepole is gaining popularity as a
source of paper pulp because dead chips are lighter than green ones.
   ``I think it's pretty sure that by the year 2,000, most of the
lodgepole pine (in Oregon) will be dead, whether it is harvested or
not,'' said Ed Blaydon, a marketing specialist for the four
national forests in southeastern Oregon.

<HEAD>Most Teachers Feel Left Out Of School Decisions</HEAD>

   A majority of public school teachers feel
uninvolved in nearly all school matters except choosing texts and
shaping curricula, a survey has found.
   Seventy-nine percent of those questioned said they feel involved
in choosing textbooks and instructional materials, and 63 percent
said they have a say in shaping the curriculum.
   But 10 percent or less of the 21,698 teachers surveyed by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancment of Teaching felt they have
any say in issues like teacher evaluation or selection of new
teachers and administrators. And only 20 percent believe they are
influential in tailoring school budgets.
   ``Whatever is wrong with America's public schools cannot be
fixed without the help of those inside the classroom. Yet in most
states, teachers have been front-row spectators in a reform
movement in which the signals are being called by governors,
legislators, state education officials _ those who are far removed
from the field of action,'' foundation President Ernest L. Boyer
said in a forward to the 14-page report titled, ``Teacher
Involvement in Decisionmaking: A State-by-State Profile.''
   The report revealed sharp disparities in the degree of
involvement teachers felt in different states.
   In Vermont, for example, 93 percent of teachers reported a high
level of involvement in choosing textbooks, 85 percent said they
helped shape the curriculum, and 50 percent said they were involved
in setting student promotion and retention policies.
   But only 63 percent of Lousiana teachers said they helped choose
texts, 40 percent said they were involved in shaping the
curriculum, 36 percent had a say in tracking students into special
classes, and 1 percent felt they had influence in selecting new
teachers.
   ``The report endorses what I have often said _ that teachers are
treated like very tall children instead of professionals,'' said
Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teacher union with 1.9 million
members.
   The 50-state teacher survey was conducted by mail in the spring
of 1987 by the Wirthlin Group, a polling organization in McLean,
Va. The poll had a margin of sampling error of less than plus or
minus 1 percent.
   Among other results:
   _ 47 percent of all surveyed said they felt involved in setting
standards of student conduct. The range was from 37 percent among
teachers in Florida, New Jersey and Rhode Island to 68 percent in
Oregon.
   _ 45 percent reported having influence in tracking students into
special classes. The high was Minnesota at 63 percent; Louisiana
was the lowest at 36 percent.
   _ 43 percent said they had a say in designing programs for staff
development. Oklahoma was highest at 82 percent, Rhode Island
lowest at 30 percent.
   _ 34 percent said they influenced which students were promoted
or held back. Vermont teachers reported the most involvement at 50
percent, Florida the lowest at 21 percent.
   _ 20 percent said they influenced the school budget. Hawaii
teachers had a 57 percent positive response; the low was 8 percent
in North Dakota.
   _ 10 percent felt involved in evaluating teacher performance.
Georgia and Utah led with 20 percent, while Florida, Nevada, New
Jersey and Rhode Island were tied at 6 percent.
   _ 7 percent said they had a hand in selecting new teachers.
Colorado, New Hampshire, and Oregon tied at 20 percent, and
Louisiana teachers reported the least involvement at 1 percent.
   _ 7 percent felt involved in picking new administrators. Vermont
had the highest positive response at 20 percent, Nevada the lowest
at 1 percent.

<TEXT>
   The head of the nation's space flight program
says NASA will not launch space shuttle Discovery late this month
unless conditions are virtually perfect for the nation's first
shuttle flight since the 1986 Challenger disaster.
   ``We're going to wait until we have it right, and then we're
going to do it,'' said Rear Adm. Richard Truly, head of the shuttle
program. ``I think the American people expect that of us and that's
what we're going to do.''
   Truly, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,
said it may take more than one countdown to get the Discovery off
the ground. He said that if two recent successful simulations had
been the real thing, a launch would not have taken place because of
weather and winds.
   ``I think that when we get do get to a launch date on the latter
part of this month, it wouldn't surprise me at all if it took us
two or three times to get airborne,'' Truly said.

<HEAD>Prison Population Hit Record Total of 604,824 in June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says federal and state prison
population grew to a record 604,824 inmates in June, increasing at
a rate that would require 900 new prison beds every week.
   The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics reported Sunday that
the national inmate population grew by 4 percent in the first six
months of 1988, with the number of female prisoners increasing by
6.7 percent.
   California, which added 5,146 inmates for a 7.7 percent increase
during the period, accounted for 22 percent of the nationwide
growth in the prison population and housed nearly 12 percent of all
federal and state prisoners, the report said.
   The largest percentage increases from Jan. 1 through June 30
occurred in Rhode Island, which reported 17.9 percent more inmates.

<HEAD>Mecham Out of Office, But He Looms Over Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evan Mecham's name is not on the ballot, but the
ousted governor's conservative spirit looms over Tuesday's primary,
as several of his backers challenge moderate Republican legislators
who voted to impeach or convict him.
   The primary _ one of six around the country Tuesday _ marks
Arizona's first election since the traumatic political upheaval of
last spring in which the Republican-controlled House voted to
impeach Mecham and the GOP-controlled Senate convicted him of
obstructing justice and misusing funds.
   The Senate votes removed him from office and automatically
installed Democrat Rose Mofford, the longtime secretary of state,
to serve in his place until 1990. The Senate declined to bar Mecham
from ever running for office again.
   After his ouster, Mecham forecast ``a revolution at the ballot
box,'' but he hasn't predicted any casualty figures in the current
primaries, and neither has anyone else.
   The former governor insists that those who keep talking about
the Mecham factor are ``trying to divert the attention of the
voters'' from the real issue: record tax and spending increases
that were passed after his ouster to bail the state out of a
deficit.
   ``It's `Let's throw enough mud at Mecham and make him the target
so that we will change the issues from the voting records of the
incumbents,''' he said.
   Mecham, a perennial political outsider, won the governorship on
his fifth try in 1986 in a three-way race. His strengths included a
get-out-the-vote campaign that mobilized his many ultraconservative
supporters and a series of tabloids that attacked his opponents.
   In the current election, Mecham's Forward Arizona Political
Action Committee has not distributed cash to candidates, and has
handed out only a handful of formal endorsements. But it has
conducted research and training for an unknown number of candidates.
   Mecham says he will support whoever wins the GOP primary, but
many Republican lawmakers fear his followers may simply refuse to
vote for them in November even if they survive the primary. In a
number of swing districts, that could hand the seat over to the
Democrats.
   It has not been easy to determine the exact number of primaries
in which loyalty to Mecham seems to be a main issue. Nine GOP
senators and 26 representatives face at least one primary opponent,
but not all of the incumbents voted against Mecham and not all of
the challengers are pro-Mecham.
   House members run in pairs, with voters in each district allowed
to vote for two candidates.
   Among those facing primary challengers are the chief legislative
architects of impeachment _ Republicans like House Speaker Joe Lane
and House Judiciary Chairman Jim Skelly.
   Lane will appear on the GOP ballot along with Gerald Patton, who
says he would like to serve with Lane, and two candidates who have
Mecham's endorsement, Lloyd Fenn and Warren Shumaker. Lane is
asking his supporters to cast just one vote instead of two and to
cast that vote for him.
   Two former Mecham aides, Ron Bellus and Ted Humes, are running
for the Legislature. Humes is unopposed for the GOP nod to run
against Democratic Senate incumbent Lela Alston. Bellus is battling
moderate Leo Corbet for the GOP nod to succeed retiring Republican
Sen. Tony West, an anti-Mechamite.
   On Friday, Mecham endorsed challengers Dean Ellsworth and Greg
Roberds over House Republicans Mark Killian and Bill Mundell in the
Mesa area even though Killian voted against impeachment after a
tearful speech castigating Mecham. Mundell voted for impeachment.
   Here are highlights of other primaries Tuesday:
   MINNESOTA _ Both GOP Sen. David Durenberger and his likely
Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III,
face minor opposition from within their parties.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican Rep. Judd Gregg is favored to win the
nomination for governor to succeed John Sununu, who is retiring.
Democrat Paul McEachern has no primary opposition.
   VERMONT _ Rep. Jim Jeffords faces conservative Michael Griffes
for the GOP nomination for the seat of retiring Republican Sen.
Robert Stafford. William Gray is the unopposed Democratic nominee.
   UTAH _ Democrats Craig S. Oliver and Robert W. Stringham both
seek the nomination to oppose three-term Republican Rep. Howard C.
Nielson.
   WISCONSIN _ Milwaukee Bucks owner Herbert Kohl and former Gov.
Anthony Earl are among four Democrats seeking the nomination for
the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. William Proxmire. On the
Republican side, state Senate Minority Leader Susan Engeleiter
faces Stephen B. King, former chairman of the state GOP.

   President Augusto Pinochet's motorcade
was stoned during a campaign tour on the 15th anniversary of the
bloody military coup he led that ousted the elected government of
President Salvador Allende.
   In the coastal resort of Vina del Mar on Sunday, nearly 5,000
protesters battled riot police following the largest ever memorial
service at the grave of Allende, who perished in the coup.
   Reporters said Gen. Pinochet's bodyguards opened fire after his
motorcade was stoned in Cerro Navia, a working-class suburb north
of Santiago. They said at least four protesters suffered bullet
wounds.
   Police did not report any injuries or arrests in Cerro Navia,
but said 142 people were arrested in Vina del Mar when people tried
to march from the cemetery into the resort's center.
   Pinochet, the only candidate in next month's presidential
referendum, was booed by hundreds of people when he arrived in
Cerro Navia.
   Many hurled rocks at his motorcade, and Pinochet's bodyguards
fired shots into the air as vehicles maneuvered around barricades
of burning tires.
   Reporters at the scene said at least four people were struck by
bullets and two were hospitalized in serious condition with stomach
wounds.
   On Sunday night, demonstrations against the military government
Pinochet has led since the coup spread to the northern Santiago
suburbs of Lo Prado, Pudahuel, Quinta Normal, Renca and Conchalii,
where protesters raised barricades of burning tires. No injuries
were reported.
   Earlier in the day, in a nationally televised speech marking the
Sept. 11, 1973, overthrow of Allende, Pinochet addressed an
audience of 3,000 people in a government office building.
   ``I am ready to give my last breath to my country,'' he said.
   Pinochet said Chileans were morally bound to support his sole
candidacy in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum that, if approved,
would give him eight more years of rule.
   The 72-year-old army commander said citizens face a choice in
the yes-or-no ballot between ``consolidating the democratic society
contemplated in the country's constitution or destroying 15 years
of patriotic labor for Chile.''
   If a majority vote against his continued rule, an open election
will be held next year and he will hand power over to the winner in
1990.
   Whether Pinochet wins or loses the vote, elections for a
Congress are planned for 1990. But the legislature will be
virtually powerless to amend an 8-year-old constitution that gives
the armed forces freedom from civilian control and a role in
national policy-making.
   Pinochet said his new government would be fully democratic.
``All sectors will be present,'' he said.
   But he attacked those who ``do not recognize the political
system in effect, aligning themselves with totalitarian groups.'' A
coalition of 16 parties, from the political center-right to the
Socialist left, are campaigning actively for his defeat in the
referendum.
   A leader of the opposition coalition, Genaro Arriagada, called
Pinochet's speech ``mediocre.''
   ``Pinochet must be judged by his merciless exercise of power,
and not by his words,'' he said.
   A government press office statement said police found and
deactivated a time bomb in a car across from the building where
Pinochet spoke.
   The statement did not explain how the car and its contents
avoided earlier discovery by police, who had combed the area
intensively and were seen to be towing away other cars hours
beforehand.
   In Vina del Mar, 75 miles northwest of Santiago, police used
tear gas, water cannon and nightsticks to break up the nearly 5,000
demonstrators who tried to march through the streets after the
tribute to Allende, a Marxist.
   Reporters saw a few demonstrators injured, including a young man
bleeding from the head after being clubbed by two policemen.
Authorities did not report any injuries but said 142 people were
detained.
   According to the government, Allende shot himself in the head
with a carbine as the Presidential Palace was in flames and under
attack by troops. Allende had declared he would not allow himself
to be deposed and taken out of the palace alive, and the military
version is accepted by most Chileans and historians.
   The military government had barred the placing of a tombstone to
mark Allende's grave, but on Sunday there was a small marble plaque
from the Socialist Party.
   During the graveside ceremony, many mourners wept. After hearing
a recording of Allende's last speech to the nation, people in the
crowd chanted, ``We can feel it, we can feel it, Allende is here.''

   Many of the 50 women who vied for the
Miss America 1989 title and lost to Miss Minnesota say they're
looking forward to an exciting year as a state queen.
   Miss Alabama Jenny Lee Jackson, fourth runner-up in the 62nd
Miss America Pageant, said Sunday she was happy to be headed home.
   ``They already treat me like I'm Miss America down there,'' the
21-year-old Auburn University senior said.
   The mood of the 50 women after the pageant ended early Sunday
was marked by expressions of glee, not gloom.
   ``No gripes here,'' said Miss Hawaii Desiree Moana Cruz, one of
10 pageant finalists.
   ``This is one happy girl,'' said the 26-year-old from Hilo.
``Instead of being 5-9, I'm like 6-2. My feet haven't touched the
ground.''
   The new Miss America is Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson, a
22-year-old Stanford University student who wants to be a
Harvard-trained lawyer. Miss Carlson left this seaside resort on a
yearlong tour of the country.
   For Carlson and the other finalists, the competition was a
chance to perform before a television audience of millions in what
was probably a once-in-a-lifetime moment.
   ``I did what I came here to do,'' said third runner-up Miss
California Marlise Sharleen Ricardos, whose emotional singing was
one of the most polished performances of the pageant.
   ``I couldn't believe I was standing up there,'' said the
26-year-old from San Pedro, who wants to be a movie actress. ``I
knew that I did the best I possibly could have. I know I could have
been Miss America.''
   The contestants said that they saw no hint of nastiness or
unfair competition among the women.
   ``There was no one that was out for blood,'' said Miss
Mississippi Carla Haag.
   ``I met and made some wonderful friends,'' said Miss Jackson.
   Miss Cruz said she recalls the contestants hugging each other
backstage after the pageant, vowing, ``Friend for life. Friend for
life.''
   The contestants said Miss Carlson, the new Miss America, seemed
quiet during the pageant, intent on the competition.
   ``To tell you the truth, I didn't really notice her,'' said Miss
Haag.

   Newly crowned Miss America Gretchen
Elizabeth Carlson, a Minnesota car dealer's daughter whose brothers
once called her ``blimpo,'' is a sushi-loving Swedish-American who
hopes to be a corporate attorney.
   The confident new Miss America 1989 says chance didn't figure
into her win.
   ``This wasn't luck,'' she said just hours after her crowning in
this seaside resort's Convention Center early Sunday, adding that
she didn't bring any good-luck charms to the 62nd Miss America
Pageant.
   The 22-year-old woman from the Minneapolis suburb of Anoka said
her own skills brought her the crown. After winning a preliminary
talent competition earlier in the week, Miss Minnesota said parts
of her performance were ``exquisite.''
   Miss Carlson performed a spirited violin solo titled ``Gypsy
Airs.'' She has studied violin for 17 years, winning national and
state violin competitions and performing a solo with the Minnesota
Orchestra.
   ``I'm definitely an overachiever,'' she said.
   This year, pageant officials took special pains to emphasize
that the judges were looking for an ``articulate, educated, dynamic
role model'' and not just a beauty queen.
   Miss Carlson is several credits away from graduating from
Stanford University with a degree in organizational behavior. She
says she wants to attend Harvard Law School ``and become a
successful corporate executive.''
   But for the next year, Miss Carlson will tour the country
promoting the Miss America scholarship program. She also will push
the products of the pageant's corporate sponsors, including
underwear, orange juice, pantyhose and hair coloring.
   Last year's Miss America, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, also used her
reign to promote nursing.
   Miss Carlson said she wants to focus on ``education for the
children of tomorrow.'' Specifically, she wants to see children
receive more education on values, ``teaching children to be less
narcissistic.''
   ``Today children tend to be more in love with themselves instead
of being in love with other people,'' said Miss Carlson.
   The new queen traveled later Sunday to New York City with Miss
Rafko, who will stay on for several days to orient the new
titleholder. Miss Carlson planned to pick out a personal wardrobe
for the year and prepare for television appearances.
   When asked what kind of Miss America she would make, Miss
Carlson laughed and replied, ``A short one.''
   The 5-foot-3 Miss Carlson didn't have to bend when Miss Rafko
placed the crown on her head. At 108 pounds, she is 20 pounds
lighter than the hefty 128 she weighed when she was 16.
   ``When I used to be fat, my brothers used to call me `blimpo,'
'' she said, adding that she ``went on this major diet and lost all
this weight.''
   Today the green-eyed blonde of Swedish descent likes to dine on
sushi.
   Sunday's crowning was supposed to be just before midnight
Saturday, but was delayed almost 12 minutes after judges had to
cast new ballots to break a tie for second runner-up.
   Miss Colorado Maya Walker was named first runner-up, Miss
Oklahoma Lori Lee Kelley won second runner-up, Miss California
Marlies Sharleen Ricardos was third runner-up and Miss Alabama
Jenny Lee Jackson was fourth runner-up.

   Rock superstar Michael Jackson ended
his European tour with an outdoor concert organizers said drew
125,000 people, and officials said more than 1,500 of the fans were
hurt in a crush near the stage.
   Organizers said the crowd at Sunday's open-air show on Aintree
horse racing course at Liverpool was the largest ever at a rock
concert in Europe.
   In all, the volunteer first-aid workers of the St. John
Ambulance Brigade said they treated an estimated 3,400 fans for
minor injuries, mostly hysteria, headaches and minor cuts.
   Brigade assistant commissioner Arthur Crook said 1,550 of the
casualties were treated after being crushed at the front of the
crowd near the makeshift stage because of the pressure behind them.
   Police said four of 40 people taken to Liverpool's Walton
Hospital were admitted but none was in serious condition.
   One of the the injured was a 6-year-old girl who suffered
bruising. Television cameras showed an unconscious young girl being
passed over the heads of the crowd to ushers.
   Reporters said part of the crowd panicked after youths without
tickets tore down fences to see the show. They said mounted police
and officers in riot gear battled with the youths, who threw rocks
at ushers.
   There was also fighting when youths tried to invade a stand
reserved for holders of tickets costing $195.
   Aintree is only used once a year for the Grand National
steeplechase and had never held so many people before, organizers
said.
   Police said about 25,000 people gate crashed the concert, either
with forged tickets or by breaking in. They said they arrested 22
people, mostly for disorder.
   Before the show, Jackson said: ``I have always considered
Liverpool the home of contemporary pop music by virtue of it being
the birthplace of the incomparable Beatles.''
   Jackson has bought the rights to the Beatles' early hits and
Jackson aides said he wanted to tour places in the port city
associated with the Fab Four but was advised not to because he
might have been spotted and mobbed.
   London's Daily Express newspaper reported without attribution
that Jackson was paid $3.4 million for the Aintree show. He began
his European tour in Rome on May 23.
   Frank Dileo, his manager, said Jackson planned no concerts after
the Aintree show and concentrate on film work and records. He said
the singer had been ``exhausted'' by the concerts.

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices rebounded moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed higher at
27,756.74. The index, a 93.01-point loser Friday, regained 109.64
points or 0.40 percent after opening at 17,698.93.
   The dollar closed at 133.42 yen, up 0.47 yen from last Friday's
close of 132.95 yen. It opened at 133.82 yen and eased toward the
end of trading after moving in a range of 133.34-133.85 yen.
   Dealers said last Friday's report of a 0.6 percent increase in
the U.S. wholesale price index for August boosted investor
confidence in the U.S. economy and prompted them to buy back some
dollars.
   ``Some foreign exchange banks were buying the dollar to adjust
their positions, but investors are basically in a wait-and-see mood
before the scheduled announcement of the U.S. trade figures,'' said
an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The Commerce Department is to announce July U.S. trade figures
in Washington on Wednesday.
   Trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was ``a bit slow mainly
because it's `sleepy Monday,' but the market overall is in good
shape,'' according to a dealer at Nomura Securities.
   A national holiday later in the week, Respect for the Aged Day,
will close markets and financial institutions on Thursday, further
slowing the momentum of trade, he added.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police and soldiers made no attempt
to intercede as thugs with guns, knives and machetes attacked
parishioners at a Mass said by an outspoken opponent of Haiti's
military rulers.
   At least three people were killed in Sunday's massacre, said a
foreign journalist who escaped, and radio reports said 60 were
wounded. Some witnesses said as many as a dozen people were killed.
   Shielded by supporters, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide escaped
uninjured.
   After the attack, gangs of armed men roamed the capital's
deserted streets, stoning two radio stations and the headquarters
of two political parties opposed to the government of Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy.
   Men fired shots about outside one of the stations, Roman
Catholic-run Radio Soleil, which went off the air after being
pelted by rocks.
   A Catholic priest and a former Senate candidate blamed the
government for the attack, which preceded a planned Sunday protest
against Namphy's voiding of Haiti's popularly approved Constitution.
   Attacks on civilians by armed thugs accused of support from the
military are not uncommon in the 2{ years since the Duvalier family
dictatorship ended. On Nov. 29, 1987, armed thugs and soldiers
killed at least 34 voters in thwarting independently run nationwide
elections.
   On Sunday, Aristide had just begun 9 a.m. Mass when a group of
men started stoning the church, said the foreign journalist, who
was attending.
   Then men shouting ``Communists, Communists!'' burst into the
church, slashing and hacking mercilessly at men, women and children
as they fled the church in panic, the journalist said.
   ``They started shooting people, beating them, and stabbing and
slashing them,'' she told The Associated Press in a telephone call
to New York. ``They stabbed a woman who was pregnant. They stabbed
another man who ran outside the church. He died. some people were
shot.'' Another witness saw a pregnant woman shot in the abdomen.
   Soldiers at a compound across the street watched the violent
attack but did not intervene.
   Asked for official government reaction, Frantz Lubin, director
of information for the military government, responded, ``No comment
before all the facts have been gathered.''
   Some witnesses said about a dozen people were killed, but the
bodies could not be removed before the attackers set the building
on fire and torched cars parked out front. Some said they saw the
assailants remove bodies from the churchyard.
   Radio stations reported 60 were treated for wounds.
   Estimates of the number of people in the church ranged from 600
to 1,600.
   A witness in the church's nearby health center said he watched
as about 300 men fell into formation and marched to the entrance of
the church compound, and stoned the courtyard and the church before
a gang of them rushed inside.
   The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Crusade for the Constitution Committee, headed by the
political opposition, had urged Haitians to dress in white Sunday
to protest Namphy's voiding of the constitution in July.
   ``The relationship between the crusade and the massacre is
obvious,'' said the Rev. Antoine Adrien, a Catholic priest. ``There
is a campaign to bring the country back to the Duvalier days, to
re-establish a reign of terror, to prevent the people from
organizing for their welfare.''
   Paul Latortue, a former Senate candidate, said he was sure the
church attack was the work of the government and its supporters.
   ``They have wanted to kill Aristide for a long time,'' he said
in San Juan, where he teaches economics at the University of Puerto
Rico. ``It is significant that the government tried to do this
today, a day of protest.''
   Aristide, who in sermons has compared Haiti's army rulers to
savages and Satan, is one of the most popular figures among this
Caribbean nation's poor masses and has been the target of several
assassination attempts.
   His modest, cement-block St. Jean Bosco Church, inside a
compound in the La Saline slum, is regularly packed with supporters.
   Aristide has never called for an armed uprising, but has
repeatedly advocated the overthrow of the military government by
what he calls ``active non-violent struggle.''
   Namphy returned to power in a coup June 19 after four months of
civilian rule under President Leslie Manigat. Namphy ruled for two
years before that as head of a junta after President Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled to exile in France on Feb. 7, 1986.
   The constitution was approved by more than 99 percent of the
voters in a March 29, 1987, referendum. It is considered the most
liberal in the country's 184-year history and prohibited Duvalier
supporters from running for office for 10 years.

   Rescue workers today cut through
concrete and steel to try to free two people trapped in the rubble
of a building whose collapse, according to police, killed at least
three people and injured 12.
   The three-story building, which was to be the offices of the
Buddha Pratheep charity foundation, caved in Sunday night on
construction workers living at the site.
   Dozens of soldiers, policemen and volunteers worked all night to
free 12 people, including a 1{-year-old boy, said Lt. Col. Nathee
Wongsathaporn, chief inspector of Phyathai police station.
   The dead were identified as a man, a woman and a five-year-old
boy who were believed to have been living on the ground floor.

   The official Tass news agency reported today that
Mikhail S. Gorbachev left Moscow for a city in Siberia, indicating
the Soviet leader had returned from his summer vacation.
   On July 30, Gorbachev met in the Kremlin with visiting Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany, then dropped from
official view.
   Soviet officials, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said Gorbachev had gone on vacation in the southern Soviet Union,
as he does every year.
   The personal lives of Kremlin officials remain little known,
despite the increased openness in society inaugurated by Gorbachev,
and no official announcement was made of the Soviet leader's
whereabouts in August.
   In a dispatch labeled with the Russian word for lightning,
indicating news of the greatest importance, Tass today announced
Gorbachev's departure for Krasnoyarsk from Moscow.
   It gave no details of how long Gorbachev will stay in the
Siberian city some 2,000 miles southeast of Moscow, and did not say
what his activities there will be.

<HEAD>Jersey City Schools Face Takeover; Parochial Schools Highly
Regarded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In New Jersey's second-largest city,
where the public schools face a state takeover, many non-Catholic
parents are sending their children to parochial schools, which they
give honors grades.
   ``I'd much rather have this than public schools,'' Irene Warren,
the mother of a first-grader, said, gesturing toward St. Paul's, an
elemantary school cited by the U.S. Department of Education as
exemplary.
   The Baptist woman said she is impressed by the structured
education offered by parochial schools.
   Because of its educational failure, the 32,000-student public
school system in this city across the Hudson River from New York
City has been targeted for the first attempt by any state to seize
control of a major urban school district.
   The district's graduation rate is 20 percent.
   Twenty-five percent of its students pass New Jersey's mandatory
proficiency exam, compared with 50 percent of students in other
urban districts. Statewide, 80 percent of students pass all three
sections of the test.
   State officials say the poor records mostly result from
political patronage.
   State Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman began legal action
in May to take control of the city's schools. Jersey City officials
have taken the matter before state Administrative Law Judge Kenneth
Springer. Hearings before Springer are expected to last into
January.
   The earliest the state could take control is May 1989, and
appeals could delay that.
   In contrast, the city's 27 Roman Catholic schools have a high
graduation rate, and send at least 75 percent of their graduates to
four-year colleges, said the Rev. Thomas McDade, the Newark
Archdiocese's associate vicar for education.
   Jersey City's Catholic schools are educating more non-Catholics
than ever and even turning away applicants, McDade said. Of the
district's 11,000 students last year, 21 percent were
non-Catholics. In some schools, the percentage was as high as 85
percent.
   ``There's much more discipline, much more structure in the
Catholic schools,'' said Brenda Hall, a Lutheran who sent her son
Garrick to his first day of school at St. Paul's last week.
   ``I wanted him to get a good foundation,'' she said. ``I think
it's pretty much common knowledge about the Jersey City public
school system.''
   An independent auditor's report on the public schools found
``the school climate is not conducive to learning, as facilities
are poorly maintained and discipline is lacking. Principals are not
in control of their buildings, and students and teachers are often
not found where they are assigned and not focused on instructional
purposes.''
   Parents groups have complained of drug use and rampant
absenteeism.
   ``The Catholic school seems to look for results and the public
school seems to look for excuses,'' said City Councilman Tom Hart,
a critic of the school board.
   Jersey City public schools are providing the first test of a law
enacted in January giving New Jersey broad powers to take over
chronically troubled schools.
   If the state wins the legal battle, it can abolish the local
board of education, fire top administrators and appoint a state
superintendent to operate the district for five years.
   David Pikus, a lawyer for the city Board of Education, said many
problems date to a prior administration. Mayor Anthony Cucci has
objected to the takeover, saying the new law unfairly targets
poorer districts that face insurmountable social problems and get
inadequate state aid.
   Local school officials say a third of the district's students
come from single-parent families and that hundreds more live in
shelters for the homeless. Many students come from homes in which
English is not the primary language.
   But, like the public schools, the Catholic schools reflect
Jersey City's ethnic diversity, McDade said. Among those enrolled
at the parochial schools are Hispanic, black, Haitian, Portuguese,
Arab, Egyptian, Filipino, Italian, Indian, Chinese and American
Indian students.
   The average cost to teach each public school student amounts to
$6,300 a year, Hart said. Tuition for parochial school students
averages about $1,600, officials said.

<HEAD>16-Year-Old Becomes Youngest Coast-to-Coast Solo Pilot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thad Mitchell, the youngest pilot to
fly coast to coast solo, says he's ready for another challenge.
   ``We were thinking about maybe crossing the Atlantic on my 17th
birthday,'' Mitchell said Sunday afternoon shortly after completing
his flight from San Diego to Jacksonville.
   ``We were just kidding around,'' Mitchell, who turned 16 on
Saturday, added quickly.
   The Pensacola teen-ager landed his single-engine Mooney 201 at
Jacksonville International Airport less than 24 hours after leaving
San Diego.
   ``I wasn't nervous at all. If I got into trouble, I could have
just landed,'' said Mitchell, who made refueling stops in El Paso,
Texas, and Lafayette, La.
   The trip made him the first pilot of any age to make his first
solo flight a transcontinental trip, according to the National
Aeronautics Association, which sanctioned the undertaking.
   Mitchell is two years away from being licensed to fly with
instruments, and must rely on visual flight rules. Because of that,
he said, he cannot fly through clouds.
   ``We flew through some pretty heavy rain in some parts and then
flew around a lot of clouds,'' he said. ``I had to dodge them. That
was really fun.''
   Flying ahead of Mitchell in a twin-engine Piper were his father,
Mark; Billy Hattaway, his flight instructor for nearly four years;
and Dick Bennett of Pensacola Aviation.
   Thad said he stayed alert by carefully following his progress on
maps.
   ``I used to think from here to Jacksonville was a pretty long
flight,'' he said. ``But the trip seemed very short.''
   Younger pilots have flown across the country with instructors,
but federal regulations prohibit solo flights until the age of 16.
   Mitchell has logged 100 hours of flying time and flew across
country with another pilot when he was 13.

   A man ranked the wealthiest
in the world runs this tiny oil-rich Moslem kingdom, and diplomats
report little dissent from people unencumbered by income taxes,
medical payments or tuition fees.
   King Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah rules the enclave on the
northeastern tip of Borneo from his 1,788-room palace. Earlier this
month, Fortune magazine called him the richest man in the world,
worth $25 billion.
   Citizens of this southeast Asian nation do not appear to object
to the king's rule because he spreads some of the money around.
   ``They (the people) are well looked after, with free education,
medical treatment, cheap housing, good pensions and any one doing
well in his studies can easily get a university education abroad at
the government's expense,'' said one diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He said there are no beggars, and about half the workforce is
employed by the government. The per capita income is estimated at
about $18,000, one of the highest in the world, according to
bankers and diplomats.
   All the money comes from oil and gas, which Brunei exports
mainly to Japan.
   A Brunei government official said recently that 1986 exports
amounted to $2.03 billion _ 99 percent of it oil and gas. Imports
for the same year totaled $785 million in cars, foodstuffs and
other goods.
   The nation, about the size of Delaware, covers just 2,226 square
miles, much of which is not suitable for cultivation, an
agricultural officer said.
   Without daily newspapers, the nation's 227,000 people get their
news mainly through state-run radio, Television Brunei and some
government publications.
   An official in the Planning Unit said Malays form the majority
of Brunei's population, but there are also about 60,000 Chinese and
other non-Malays.
   About 87,000 people are employed and of these 28,000 are foreign
workers, including foreign maids, doctors, lawyers, engineers,
accountants and others.
   Brunei has no elected Parliament and Sultan Bolkiah rules the
nation with the help of a Cabinet comprising two of his brothers
and about seven other people.
   The 41-year-old monarch, who studied in neighboring Malaysia
before a stint at the British Military Academy in Sandhurst,
England, in 1966, was crowned the 29th King of Brunei in 1967 by
his father Sir Omar Ali Saifuddin, who abdicated in favor of his
son.
   The king loves polo and has about 200 Argentine polo ponies,
some of which are kept in air-conditioned stables. He has two wives
and six children.
   In the 14th and 15th century, Brunei was a large empire
stretching from the northern Philippines to most parts of Borneo,
but when the colonialists came Brunei shrank. Brunei became a
British protectorate in 1906 and won its independence on Dec. 31,
1983.
   The country has no income tax, gasoline is cheap and there are
no major taxes on cars, which are imported from Japan and
elsewhere. Diplomats estimate foreign reserves at $20 billion.
   The King has powers to detain and hold without trial anyone
deemed to be a threat to the security of the nation. On July 14,
the government released 34 such detainees, leaving just six still
in custody.
   Diplomats say there appears to be no long-term threat to
Brunei's economy as the 120,000 barrels of oil being pumped daily
is expected to last ``well into the next century''.
   Brunei is officially known as Brunei Darusalam.
   Darusalam means abode of peace ``and there is indeed peace
here'' said a diplomat, who added ``they could have added
prosperity to it.''

<TEXT>
   A letter attributed to a West German
hostage by a Beirut newspaper says the man expects to be freed
Monday by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors.
   ``To the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, I should
be freed on Monday,'' said the nine-line letter attributed to
Rudolf Cordes and published Monday on the front page of the
independent newspaper An-Nahar.
   There was no way to authenticate either that the handwriting was
that of Cordes, who has been held for 20 months, or that the
statement was indeed from his captors.
   The quote about his release was the only one that could be fully
understood from the handwritten letter. Other phrases, many words
of which were illegible, said: ``Please inform my family'' and
urged ``Please help the hostages.''
   It was not clear if he was indicating he is being held with
other hostages.
   It also was unclear whether the letter was an attempt to
influence the ongoing trial in West Germany of a Lebanese Shiite
Moslem, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who is charged with murder and air
piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 after
explosives were found in his luggage. His older brother, Abbas, was
convicted by a West German court in April of complicity in the
kidnappings of Cordes and West German businessman Alfred Schmidt in
a bid to free Mohammed.
   Abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Schmidt, kidnapped
seven days before Cordes' Jan. 17, 1987 abduction, was released in
September 1987.
   Another Hamadi brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is believed to head
the Holy Warriors for Freedom, which claimed responsibility for the
kidapping of Cordes, 55, Beirut manager for Hoechst AG, one of West
Germany's largest chemical companies.
   Abdul-Hadi is also chief of the security apparatus of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Other pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist groups, all believed
to be linked to one another, claim they are holding 17 other
foreigners, including nine Americans.
   The hostage held the longest is American Terry Anderson, who was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   An-Nahar said the letter was delivered to its West Beirut
offices at dawn Monday along with an Arabic statement, signed by
the Holy Warriors for Freedom.
   The Arabic-language statement said the German-language letter
was written by Cordes.
   The seven-line Arabic statement said:
   ``We would like to inform those concerned that new developments
toward the release of the West German Cordes will be announced
within the coming 48 hours. ``Therefore, a representative of
(Syrian) President Hafez Assad and the West German ambassador are
requested to come to the Beaurivage Hotel within this period.''
   The Beaurivage Hotel in the seaside Ramlet al-Baida district is
close to the command headquarters of Syrian troops in charge of
west Beirut's security.
   There was no explanation for the discrepancy for the Monday
release mentioned in the German letter and the 48-hour period in
the Arabic release.

   A cargo rocket brought fuel, food and mail today
to the three Soviet cosmonauts manning the orbiting Mir space
station, the Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said the Progress rocket docked with the Mir at 5:22 a.m.
Moscow time (9:22 p.m. EDT Sunday) with the help of automatic
on-board systems.
   ``It brought supplies of fuel for the united propulsion system
of the station, foodstuffs, equipment, apparatus and mail,'' Tass
said. The news agency had announced the launch of the Progress-38
on Saturday.
   Tass said the three Soviet spacemen aboard the Mir _ Vladimir
Titov, Musa Manarov, Valery Polyakov _ are feeling fine, and that
on-board systems are working normally.
   Last week, two other cosmonauts, a Soviet and an Afghan, had
difficulties when they separated their Soyuz capsule from the Mir
for a return to Earth. Equipment problems and human error delayed
their landing by a day.

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen, while
stock prices rebounded moderately in Tokyo today.
   The dollar closed at 133.42 yen, up 0.47 yen from Friday's close
of 132.95 yen, with spot volume estimated at $4.8 billion.
   After opening at 133.82 yen, the U.S. currency gradually
declined, then reversed direction after Japanese trade figures for
August were released late in the afternoon, said Hajime Sugiyama of
the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The trade surplus, $4.9 billion, was less than most of the
investors had expected. Now they have started worrying that the
U.S. trade balance for July may not be too bad,'' he said.
   The U.S. trade figures are scheduled to be announced Wednesday.
   ``That's why some investors sold yen to buy dollars,'' Sugiyama
added.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 27,756.74, up 109.64 points or 0.40
percent from Friday's close of 27,647.10.
   Steels and high-tech issues, which attracted investors during
the afternoon session, pushed up the Nikkei index, which had
fluctuated in the morning. Volume traded on the market's first
section was estimated at 700 million shares.
   ``Volume was quite satisfactory for a day like this, considering
it's Monday, especially when everybody is worried about the U.S.
trade figures due soon,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Investors are getting rather optimistic here,'' the analyst
added.
   Other dealers said a fall in crude oil prices last week wiped
out Tokyo investors' concern over inflation and higher interest
rates in the United States.

   Residents of this Minneapolis suburb, which
bills itself as the ``Halloween capital of the world,'' are eager
to add a new label: Home of Miss America.
   ``It puts the city on the map,'' Mayor Steve Halsey said after
Miss Minnesota Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson was crowned Miss America
1989 early Sunday.
   ``I can see it now,'' said Bruce Frank, general manager of KANO
radio in this city of 16,000 about 10 miles northwest of
Minneapolis: ``Welcome to Anoka, home of Gretchen E. Carlson, Miss
America.
   ``Everyone I talked to is just ecstatic,'' said Frank, whose
station sent a good-luck telegram with 276 signatures to Miss
Carlson in Atlantic City, N.J., before the pageant's finale began
Saturday.
   Anoka claims to sponsor the largest celebration of Halloween in
the world. The city has held a parade and other Halloween
activities since the 1930s, when city officials organized events to
deter young people from tipping over outhouses and performing other
pranks and vandalism, Halsey said.
   Miss Carlson is well known in Anoka because of her talent as a
violin virtuoso and academic excellence at Anoka High School, where
she was a class co-valedictorian in 1984.
   Her father, Lee, owns a car dealership here and a grandfather,
the Rev. William Hyllengren, was pastor of a Lutheran church here
before he retired.
   Anoka-Hennepin School District Superintendent Lew Finch said he
shouldn't have been surprised because Miss Carlson has been a
success all her life, but said he couldn't believe it when she was
crowned.
   ``We were about as ecstatic as her family,'' Finch said. ``We've
watched Gretchen grow up and she's just been a marvelously talented
person. From the time she was a little girl, when she played the
violin, she just held people in awe.''
   Miss Carlson is the third Minnesota winner to be crowned Miss
America. Bebe Shopp was the winner in 1948 and Dorothy Benham won
in 1977.
   Peter Turok, executive vice president of the Anoka Area Chamber
of Commerce, said he participated in a training exercise organized
by Miss Carlson's father before the pageant in which people quizzed
her to prepare her for pageant interviews.
   ``I asked her what she would like to see on her resume 10 years
from now,'' Turok said. ``She said, `Well, being crowned Miss
America.'''

   Some Gulf Coast residents needed little more
than brooms and rakes to clean up after Hurricane Florence came
ashore and fizzled into a tropical storm, but forecasters kept a
wary eye on Hurricane Gilbert in the Caribbean.
   ``We got off very easy on this one,'' Gov. Buddy Roemer's
spokesman, Jeff Cowart, said Sunday night. ``It just happened to be
a very weak storm and all the parishes involved were very well
prepared.''
   A preliminary report from the Office of Emergency Preparedness
indicated no areas would qualify for federal assistance, Cowart
said.
   Residents, many of whom have returned home after other
hurricanes to find major damage, for the most part had only to
clean downed tree limbs and blown debris after Florence came ashore
Saturday.
   No lives were lost to the storm, officials said.
   ``We were very lucky on this one, and well prepared. We're just
hoping Gilbert doesn't head this way now,'' Cowart said.
   Gilbert churned westward toward Jamaica today after skirting the
southern coasts of Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
   Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused
flooding in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night. There were no
immediate reports of casualties.
   ``We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be
a major threat to the United States or not,'' said National
Hurricane Center meteorologist Martin Nelson. ``We're trying not to
think about it hitting the United States yet _ that's a long way
down the road.''
   In Delacroix, La., a levee broke during Florence, Cowart said,
but was repaired by Saturday afternoon and water was being pumped
out of the area.
   The list of storm damage for the most part included downed trees
and power lines. Utility companies estimated 100,000 people lost
power because of the storm. Service was restored by Saturday night.
   Flooding as a result of the hurricane was limited to
``flood-prone areas,'' Cowart said. ``It wasn't bad anywhere, at
the worst, I'd say maybe 2 feet of water was in some places,'' he
said.
   Roemer, who cut short a trip to Japan because of the hurricane,
was briefed on storm damage Sunday, Cowart said.
   Cowart said 27,500 people were evacuated from low-lying homes,
but had all returned by Saturday night.
   ``The evacuation went very smoothly; we were very ready for this
storm. It turned out to be a small one, which was fine with us, but
we were ready for it either way,'' he said.
   Florence hit on the anniversary of Hurricane Betsy, a killer
storm that devastated southern Louisiana 23 years ago. Since then,
officials say, the state has beefed up the levee systems that
protect low areas from flooding and instituted sound evacuation and
storm procedures.

   A young man was stabbed to death and a
dozen other people were beaten or knifed at a rap-music concert in
this New York City suburb, say officials who are contemplating a
ban on such events.
   Knives and pistols were apparently smuggled inside Nassau
Veterans Memorial Coliseum before Saturday night's violence even
though the 10,000 people who attended ``Jam 88'' had to pass
through an electronic weapons check, police said.
   Investigators believe a gang of about a dozen people may have
been responsible for much of the violence, which apparently
occurred during chain snatchings and other robberies, Deputy Chief
Otto Geiger said Sunday.
   It was the latest in a series of violent incidents nationwide
connected with concerts of rap music, rhyming songs with a driving
beat and often-aggressive lyrics.
   Eight people were stabbed and at least five others were beaten
during the concert, which featured such top rap stars as Eric B.
and Rakim, Kool Moe Dee and Doug E. Fresh.
   Three of the stabbing victims were listed in critical but stable
condition early today at Nassau County Medical Center.
   Detective Sgt. John Nolan described the gang as organized.
   ``It looked like these men had a discipline, a leader and a
plan, and they carried it out with some precision,'' Nolan said.
The plan involved surrounding the mugging victim and stabbing him
so the thief could get away, Nolan said.
   The man who was slain, 19-year-old Julio Fuentes of New York
City, was stabbed once in the chest shortly after he entered the
colisuem.
   ``He was with his girlfriend,'' Geiger said. ``He resisted and
he was stabbed in his upper chest.''
   Ten of the wounded were taken to Hempstead General Hospital, but
only two were admitted, said acting hospital administrator Marilyn
Hurley said only two were admitted. Both were in fair condition
today, said a hospital spokeswoman who refused to give her name.
   Last month, two people were stabbed at a Run-DMC concert at the
colisuem. Geiger said the same gang may have been responsible.
   Police and coliseum officials will meet in the next few days to
determine what steps should be taken to prevent violence, he said.
   Those steps could include a ban on rap concerts, said colisuem
spokeswoman Hilary Hartung.
   Mineola is on Long Island about six miles east of New York City.

<HEAD>Unionists: Talks Will Go Nowhere Without Legalization of
Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

   Solidarity advisors say round-table talks
with communist authorities may not get off the ground unless the
government shows it is willing in principle to reinstate the
independent labor movement.
   On Sunday, a group of intellectuals and artists met with
Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa to endorse his participation in the
talks.The roughly 60 advisors, calling themselves the Council on
Poland, also demanded the immediate legalization of Solidarity.
   The government promised the talks on jointly solving Poland's
economic and social crises in exchange for an end to a nearly
three-week strike wave and a mediator said Sunday that the
discussions could begin this week.
   A resolution adopted by the the advisors said: ``The most
important condition for the beginning of a true dialogue between
the civil opposition and the authorities (is) the legalization of
Solidarity and the immediate implementation of pluralism.''
   The labor unrest that began in mid-August and ended Sept. 3
posed the most serious threat to the government since it suppressed
Solidarity with a 1981 military crackdown. Authorities had promised
Walesa in talks Aug. 31 that they would discuss legalizing
Solidarity if he persuaded workers to end their occupation strikes.
   ``We are extending our full support in negotiations concerning
this issue to the founder of Solidarity,'' Sunday's resolution
said, referring to Walesa.
   No date has been set for the talks with authorities, but Andrzej
Stelmachowski, the law professor who has been acting as a mediator
in arranging the meetings, said they could begin this week.
   Union advisers said the talks might not get anywhere unless
there is evidence authorities are willing in principle to legalize
Solidarity.
   ``No round-table talks make sense unless at their first stage,
or even in the preparatory stage, the authorities' intentions are
made credible ... by some form of recognition of Solidarity's right
to function legally,'' Piotr Konopka, a Walesa aide, told reporters.
   Solidarity hopes for some signal on the government's willingness
to recognize Solidarity during a preparatory meeting to be held
with officials before the round-table talks, several Solidarity
advisers said.
   Sunday's session was part of a two-day Solidarity conference in
the northern port of Gdansk.
   About 100 people gathered after Sunday Mass in a room at St.
Brygida's Roman Catholic Church, which serves as the headquarters
of the Solidarity leadership.
   Walesa joined intellectuals, workers and regional Solidarity
leaders for the session, chaired by Bronislaw Geremek, a historian
and one of Walesa's closest advisers. Included in the group of
writers, actors and scholars were filmmaker Andrzej Wajda, Catholic
newspaper editor Jerzy Turowicz and former head of the journalists'
union, Stefan Bratkowski.
   A spokesman for the group, author Edmund Osmanczyk, told
reporters during a break in the discussions: ``By means of
recognizing pluralism we might finally become a normal state, where
a majority of citizens control the ruling minority, like elsewhere
in the world.''
   At the Mass earlier, the Rev. Henryk Jankowski spoke to a
congregation of 5,000 Solidarity supporters, stressing the need for
unity in Polish society as the talks begin.
   ``Today there is a chance for round-table (talks) and we cannot
waste it,'' he said in his sermon. ``Just the opposite, we have to
break down all the barriers, cast in solid concrete, to get there
and sit at that table.''
   Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Solidarity activist from Warsaw who
monitors human rights abuses in Poland for the union, said before
Sunday's meeting that the mood was optimistic. He said Solidarity
was more active and better organized than it has been in years.
   The union federation was banned the year after martial law was
imposed in 1981.

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Problems of distributing relief
materials to millions of stricken people and combating the rapid
spread of disease plagued this flooded nation today despite steady
declines in river levels.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad told a news conference his
government has been trying to reach an estimated 30 million to 40
million people who were either marooned by the floods or in need of
food and medical assistance.
   The flooding that started June 13 has claimed 866 lives,
according to the government. Daily reports by Dhaka newspapers put
the death toll at 1,647.
   The number of known diarrhea cases in the country continued to
rise, with the government's Health Control Center reporting more
than 211,000 cases nationwide. However, the pro-government
newspaper Bangladesh Times today quoted relief officials as saying
the number exceeded 300,000.
   Ershad said 130 people were known to have died of diarrhea. He
said he was unaware of any cholera cases, but doctors and
newspapers said cholera has been diagnosed in patients who drank
flood-contaminated water.
   About 5 percent of the patients admitted to the International
Center for Diarrheal Disease Research in Dhaka had contracted
cholera, according to a doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   When asked about cholera at his news conference, Ershad said,
``I have no reports of cholera, but I will check up.''
   Both illnesses have similar symptoms, but cholera is more
serious and verified through laboratory tests.
   The doctor said 550 people suffering from diarrhea or cholera
had been admitted to the diarrhea center since Sunday. Last month,
the center averaged 155 patients a day. He said the current
percentage of cholera cases was normal, even during non-flood
periods.
   ``Cholera is endemic in Bangladesh,'' he said.
   Asked about the possibility of illness escalating as the flood
waters receded, Ershad said: ``The fear of having an epidemic is
already there.''
   He noted that his country has only 8,000 doctors. In a country
with a population of 110 million, that is a ratio of 13,750 per
doctor, compared with one doctor per 5,000 in India and one per 780
in the United States.
   Ershad said estimates indicate 3.5 million tons of grain have
been destroyed by the floods _ 20 percent of the grain needed to
feed the country this year.
   Ershad said foreign pledges for flood relief have reached about
$280 million. He said the rebuilding of roads washed away by the
floods would require at least that amount.
   About half the aid offered so far has come from the United
States, which has pledged nearly $150 million in wheat, wheat seeds
and cash for emergency airlift assistance as well as contributions
to international agencies such as Save the Children, CARE and World
Vision Relief and Development.
   An American C5-A Galaxy trasnport plane arrived in Dhaka today,
carrying water tanks and purification units and plastic sheeting to
be used for temporary shelters.
   The floodwaters have covered three-fourths of Bangladesh,
according to Ershad.
   ``For centuries the people of Bangladesh have lived with floods,
but never before have the rivers unleased such fury on her
people,'' the president said.
   The Flood Control Center said today that all major rivers were
falling but remain above flood level.
   The Brahmaputra dropped 8 inches at some stations since Sunday.
The smaller Buriganga, which has flooded about half of Dhaka,
dropped 2 inches during the same period.
   ``The flood situation in the country is steadily improving,''
said one control center official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   On Sunday, Ershad called for water experts from India, China,
Nepal and Bangladesh to meet to discuss flood-control in the
region, which is hit by annual monsoons from June through September.
   Ershad told a gathering in the northern township of Grudaspur
that Bangladesh did not have the expertise nor resources to tackle
the problem alone.

   Somber Cabinet officials demanded the
federal government's ``let-it-burn'' policy be revised after
touring the fire-blackened West, and promised to send 1,200 Marines
and other soldiers to help fight wildfires.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng, Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV and Idaho Gov.
Cecil Andrus on Sunday toured the Boise Interagency Fire Center,
which coordinates Western firefighting.
   Earlier in the weekend the Cabinet members, sent to the West by
President Reagan, inspected fire damage in Yellowstone National
Park.
   ``The most important thing is to concentrate our efforts on
getting these fires under control and then out,'' Hodel said
Sunday. ``The old policy has to be reviewed and altered.''
   The 16-year-old policy allows fires ignited naturally to burn
within wilderness areas and national parks unless they endanger
people or property. Wildfires on conventional national forest or
rangelands are fought with available resources, he said.
   In that time, 16,000 fires have burned a total of about 30,000
acres in the park, Hodel said. About 900,000 acres of Yellowstone
have burned.
   At Old Faithful geyser, Taft announced that two Marine
battalions _ 1,200 men, from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and two Army
battalions would be dispatched to the firelines. The Pentagon has
already sent 2,300 Army soldiers to help hard-pressed fire crews.
   ``So by the end of next week, we will see a doubled
representation by the military in this effort,'' Taft said.
   Some critics of the ``let-it-burn'' guidelines, including Sen.
Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., have called for the resignation of National
Park Service Director William Mott for adhering to the policy.
   Rep. Richard Stallings, D-Idaho, has called for an ``immediate
and sweeping'' re-evaluation by Congress of the Park Service's
forest management.
   ``We need to emphasize that there are thousands of men and women
on the fire lines who need our support,'' Hodel said. ``We've
received some expressions that indicate the `Monday morning
quarterbacking' already going on is undercutting their morale.''
   ``The park is still there,'' Hodel said. ``There's a great deal
of natural beauty and wonder still to see. We do have devastation
to the vegetation, much of it along roadways where visitors will
see it.''
   Yellowstone has received a dusting of snow, slowing the spread
of the blazes criss-crossing the park. But the interior secretary
said forecasts of warmer weather this week could bring them back to
life.
   The Boise Interagency manages supplies and personnel for large
fires involving overhead management teams. It has transported
nearly 2.7 million pounds of equipment to the blazes this year with
a total cost of about $15 million, said Sandi Sacher, BIFC fire
information officer.
   Some 68,490 fires have burned more than 4 million acres this
year in the United States, including Alaska, said Boise Interagency
Fire Center spokeswoman Sandi Sacher.
   The Department of the Interior oversees the National Park
Service and the Bureau of Land Management, while the Agriculture
Department manages the Forest Service.

   A waiting crowd cried, laughed, cheered and sang as
671 Cubans who had been exiles in Panama and Costa Rica arrived by
air after months or years of separation from relatives living in
south Florida.
   ``This is the happiest day of my life,'' a teary-eyed Elena
Socarras, said after being reunited with her daughter, Zoila
Menendez of North Miami, on her arrival Sunday from Panama. ``I
have wanted to live in this country all my life.''
   Ms. Sacarras had been waiting in Panama for a visa since 1984,
when she left Cuba.
   Three planes _ two from Costa Rica and one from Panama _ brought
the exiles in an operation organized by the Miami-based Cuban
American National Foundation, the first private U.S. group to
sponsor refugees under a recently approved federal program.
   There were 293 refugees from 102 families aboard the first
flight, which arrived from Costa Rica early Sunday at Miami
International Airport.
   ``It was extremely exciting,'' foundation staff member Fernando
Rojas said. ``They were all tremendously happy to see their family
members, family members who they haven't seen in years.''
   Sixteen Cubans who had been scheduled to arrive Sunday were left
behind in Costa Rica and Panama because of minor problems with
their paperwork, foundation spokeswoman Brenda Moreira said. All
were expected to travel to Miami by month's end, she said.
   Under a special agreement with the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the arriving refugees were whisked through
Customs, immigration and public health checks at a special staging
area set up to speed them to official welcoming ceremonies and
family reunions at suburban Tamiami Park.
   School buses donated for the occasion carried the new arrivals
to the ceremonies directly from the international terminal gates.
   The new immigration program allows up to 4,000 refugees to come
to the United States to live if they obtain private sponsors and
proof they have support and medical coverage for two years.
   The arrival of the three planeloads of refugees marked the end
of a two-year effort by the foundation to get Cubans here from
third countries, where they had gone in hopes of eventually making
it to the United States.
   Volunteers spent the past week telephoning relatives of the
refugees, preparing legal work, coordinating bus trips and stuffing
welcome bags of black beans, rice, coffee, condensed milk, soda and
guava.
   One man handed out dollar bills to arriving children.
   ``I want them to get their first dollar in America from me,''
said Osvaldo Suarez of Miami, who had no relatives arriving on the
flights.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha embarked
today on his first summit-level mission into black Africa, flying
to Marxist-ruled Mozambique for talks with a government that has
blamed its woes on South Africa.
   After meeting with President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique near
a South African-assisted hydroelectric project, Botha was to
continue on to Malawi for talks Tuesday with President Hastings
Kamuzu Banda. Malawi is the only African state maintaining full
diplomatic ties with white-ruled South Africa.
   Botha and Chissano were expected to discuss a mutual
non-aggression treaty signed between the two countries in 1984.
   The treaty lapsed in 1985 when Mozambique produced evidence that
South Africa violated it by continuing to assist the Mozambique
National Resistance rebel movement, which began an insurgency two
years after independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The war, combined with drought, has left millions of Mozambicans
homeless and short of food.
   Many Western governments, including the United States, have
increased aid to Mozambique and endorse its contention that the
rebels receive covert logistical and communications aid from South
Africa.
   South Africa insists it no longer aids the rebels, and Botha is
expected to try to convince Chissano to mute the allegations.
   Botha, whose plane departed from an air force base at Pretoria,
was accompanied by his defense minister, Gen. Magnus Malan, and
Foreign Minister Pik Botha. Chissano's delegation, which left
Maputo for the northwestern town of Songo early today, included
three Cabinet ministers and two military commanders, according to
the Mozambican news agency AIM.
   In the past year, as part of an effort to improve its regional
image, South Africa has expanded its trade mission in Maputo and
pursued economic development possibilities in Mozambique.
   The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at
rehabilitating Cahora Basso, the giant hydroelectric project in the
northern, war-torn province of Tete, so that South Africa can
purchase electricity.
   The rebels repeatedly have sabotaged power lines leading from
Cahora Basso to South Africa.
   Even when their relations were badly strained, Mozambique and
South Africa maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of
Mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in South Africa,
and Maputo's electricity is supplied by South Africa.
   Botha, during his 10 years in power, has had few chances to
travel in black Africa. In 1986, he was one of numerous dignitaries
who attended the coronation of Swaziland's King Mswati III, and in
1987 he made a secret visit to South African troops fighting in
Angola.
   He had hoped to visit Brazzaville, Congo, earlier this year in
conjunction with peace talks on Angola and South-West Africa, or
Namibia, but Angola's Cuban allies reportedly threatened to scuttle
the talks if he went.

   The Guggenheim Museum received a $1,000 donation
toward its expansion plans from a man who shows up at the Fifth
Avenue institution every day _ but has never gone in to see the art.
   Fotios Velis, a Greek immigrant who has been selling hot dogs
and other snacks from his cart in front of the museum for 13 years,
said he wanted to make the gift to say thanks.
   A museum spokeswoman called the gift ``particularly gratifying.''
   Velis, 35, came to New York City from Greece in 1976 and had his
own cart by his second day. Since then, he estimates he's sold
about 1 million hot dogs.
   ``This is my new country and I had to show my gratitude by
becoming a success,'' he said Sunday.
   Why has he never gone in to see the museum's displays?
   ``I'm working when they are open,'' he said.

   The dollar opened higher in Europe today, but fell
against many major foreign currencies following reports the West
German central bank intervened and sold dollars, dealers said.
   Gold prices fell as much as $11.
   Traders in Rome said they were surprised by the Deutsche
Bundesbank's intervention, as the dollar had been trading steadily
in a narrow range for most of the morning.
   Traders had said they expected the dollar to remain steady until
American trade figures for July are released in Washington on
Wednesday.
   Those figures are expected to show a trade deficit of between
$10 billion and $13.5 billion, they said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar edged up 0.47 yen to close at 133.42 after Japanese
trade figures for August were released. Dealers said the trade
surplus of $4.9 billion was lower than many expected.
   Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 133.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8470 West German marks, down from 1.8490
   _1.5605 Swiss francs, down from 1.5620
   _6.2785 French francs, down from 6.2865
   _2.0900 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0835
   _1,381.00 Italian lire, up from 1,379.50
   _1.2388 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2395
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6955, little changed from
$1.6980 late Friday.
   Gold prices fell sharply in Europe after oil prices fell again.
   The precious metal opened in London at a bid price of $421.80 a
troy ounce, down $5 from the $426.80 bid late Friday. At midmorning
Monday, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended
price of $418.
   In Zurich, gold was quoted at $418.00 when the market closed at
6 a.m. EDT for a local holiday, down more than $11 from the $429.50
bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.60 to close at a bid $419.18.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.39 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $6.63.

   Officials from the city, Justice Department
and the NAACP will meet with a federal judge this week to fine-tune
a desegregation plan that emerged as the city teetered toward the
edge of bankruptcy.
   The conference comes after two councilmen changed their minds
and voted early Saturday to accept the judge's plan following a
series of noisy and emotional City Council meetings.
   They switched after lawyers from the city and the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People agreed on a
compromise housing plan the councilmen hope U.S. District Judge
Leonard Sand will accept.
   Fines imposed by Sand on the city reached $1 million a day on
Friday, forcing the layoffs of hundreds of workers that would have
taken effect Saturday had the councilmen remained defiant.
   Now, the fines and layoffs are on hold.
   Sand told lawyers for the city, the federal government and the
NAACP to gather Wednesday to go over the alternative plan.
   Sand could accept the new plan or again order the city to abide
by his original order.
   Sand had called for 200 units of low-income public housing on a
number of sites scattered throughout mainly white neighborhoods and
800 units of middle-income subsidized housing scattered throughout
Yonkers.
   The City Council had agreed to the original plan earlier this
year and the city agreed in a consent decree to follow it. But
officials disagreed on how it should be implemented.
   The new city-NAACP proposal would substitute two new housing
sites for one of the original seven; mix some low-income units with
more expensive ones; substantially alter the style and mix of the
housing; rehabilitate some existing housing; and create a new
organization to manage the housing.
   ``There is a sense of hope,'' said the Rev. Darryl George after
preaching Sunday morning to his predominantly black congregation at
the Messiah Baptist Church. ``We have crossed the first hurdle, yet
we have a healing process that is still occurring.''
   ``We have to take an active role now and make sure this (plan)
does work,'' said Peter Chema, a councilman who was called a
``snake'' by a resident after he switched his vote.
   But the alternative plan has its detractors.
   ``What we're doing is creating slums,'' said Henry Spallone, one
of two councilmen who voted ``no'' Saturday. ``After we put the
first one in and it starts to deteriorate like all public housing
does, we're going to have a multitude of problems.''
   Spallone said the council's action ``probably reduced the value
of every house in Yonkers by a minimum of $50,000, and as much as
$100,000.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said he would appoint a task force and Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan promised to arrange a meeting between city
officials and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko said Saturday's vote was a watershed,
because it meant the council would now work with the court. ``None
of us are comfortable with the court's plan,'' he said, ``but the
court imposed it because the council refused to get involved.''
   Nicholas Longo, the other councilman who changed his vote, said
the impending layoffs transformed the mounting fines from the
abstract into reality.
   Wasicsko said he ran into an east Yonkers resident who had been
a vehement opponent of the housing plan: ``The other day he was
standing in front of his house, knee deep in garbage. He says,
`It's time for integration.'''
   Wasicsko's mother, a library clerk, was among those who was to
be laid off.
   The Justice Department filed the desegregation lawsuit in 1980
and was joined by the NAACP, and three years ago Sand ordered an
end to segregated housing and schools in Yonkers.
   On Aug. 2 he had found the city of 194,000 in contempt of court
for the council's refusal to carry out a housing desegregation
order it approved earlier this year.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
promised supporters at his 71st birthday party that he would return
to his homeland without resorting to violence.
   ``It is my habit every birthday to ask, `Who am I? What have I
done to be remembered in history?''' the exiled Marcos told about
3,500 supporters at a celebration here Sunday. ``Today I am faced
with the greatest crisis that has confronted me. God knows who I
am. But how will the people know?'
   ``Am I a scoundrel? A thief of ill-gotten wealth? I am no
scoundrel,'' Marcos said, adding that the Philippine government
should allow him to face accusations in person.
   ``I will go back, I intend to go back, at any price, without
violence,'' Marcos said. ``I say face me now, or face the verdict
of history.''
   Several criminal and civil lawsuits filed by Marcos' opponents
in the Philippines and the United States accuse the ousted leader
of plundering billions of dollars from his country during his
20-year rule. Marcos has filed a petition to return to the
Philippines, but President Corazon Aquino has denied his request.
   Thousands of supporters, many wearing T-shirts or waving
placards bearing Marcos' likeness, yelled ``Bring Home Marcos'' and
``Mabuhay Marcos,'' which in the Philippine language Tagalog wishes
a long life.
   Imelda Marcos, dressed in a long, turquoise-colored gown and
several pieces of gold and diamond jewelry, addressed the crowd in
Tagalog but switched to English to say ``the only hidden wealth of
Marcos is in his heart and his mind _ enrichment and
enlightenment.''
   The event _ which was part birthday party, part floor show and
part political rally _ was sponsored by the local group ``Friends
of Marcos.''
   Marcos, who has lived in exile here since February 1986, was
greeted by cheers and choruses of ``Happy Birthday'' when he and
his wife arrived through a back entrance at the Blaisdell Center
Arena.

   About 150 disciples of Indian guru
Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh spent the weekend taking a final look at the
isolated central Oregon ranch that served as the sect's showplace.
   Rancho Rajneesh, 64,000 acres of sagebrush-dotted hills on the
high desert, will be sold at auction next month. It had been for
sale for $28 million, but fell under foreclosure proceedings by
Connecticut General Life Insurance Co.
   ``It's such a beautiful place, such a peaceful place and this
planet has no use for it,'' said Swami Prem Niren, the American
lawyer who serves as Rajneesh's ``ambassador to the United States.''
   ``Nobody wants to put the resources into even using it for what
it's already been built for ... a great big meditation center.''
   The commune, incorporated as Rajneeshpuram on part of the ranch,
was home to thousands of red-clad disciples from 1981 to 1985. They
toiled 12-hour days and showered Rajneesh with jewels and Rolls
Royces that he used for daily drives past lines of singing,
clapping followers.
   The commune disbanded in 1985 after the guru pleaded guilty to
federal immigration charges. Under a plea agreement, he received a
suspended 10-year sentence, paid a $400,000 fine and agreed not to
return to the United States for five years without the written
permission of the U.S. attorney general.
   Rajneesh, 56, returned to Pune, India, where he carries on his
meditation teachings as the self-described ``guru of the rich.''
   The ``family reunion and picnic'' drew about 150 West Coast
disciples who endured the perilous gravel road into the ranch to
tour the abandoned buildings and reminisce about the commune's
heyday.
   The reunion ``happened by itself,'' Niren said. ``Some people
wanted to come here and be here while it's still possible.''
   The gathering was closed to the public except for a news
conference Sunday at which Niren reiterated accusations that the
U.S. government destroyed the commune and poisoned Rajneesh after
he was arrested. Niren acknowledged, however, that he had no
evidence of such a crime.
   The news conference followed an emotional singing and meditation
session outside the house where the guru lived.
   Tears streamed down the faces of several disciples as Niren
recalled the turbulence that marked the commune's downfall.
   He criticized the reign of Ma Anand Sheela, Rajneesh's personal
secretary who is in federal prison.
   ``She's just another power-hungry politician,'' Niren said.
   Among those on hand for the news conference was Wasco County
Judge William Hulse, who said he came to the reunion when offered a
ride by the county sheriff. Sheela was convicted of assault for
handing Hulse a glass of poisoned water.
   ``I didn't want the people out here to think I was going to rub
it in,'' Hulse said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yoko Ono says a new biography's portrayal of her
late husband, John Lennon, as a violent, schizophrenic drug addict
is akin to a second murder.
   ``It's like John has been assassinated twice,'' she said in
today's New York Post. ``I thought of Picasso's wife who committed
suicide, but I'd never do that because of Sean,'' she added,
referring to her and Lennon's son.
   But the author of ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' Arthur Goldman,
said in an interview in today's New York Times that he was sticking
by the claims he made in the best seller.
   ``If you were to encounter the real John Lennon and live with
him for six months, I think you would be very disgusted,'' Goldman
said.
   The former Beatle, who was killed in front of his Manhattan
apartment building on Dec. 8, 1980, did not have anorexia or
dyslexia, as the book claims, Ono said.
   ``These are very serious diseases and, fortunately, John did not
have any of them,'' she said. ``But it's not fair to laugh at all
the people in the world who suffer from these diseases.''
   She also took issue with Goldman's claim that Lennon had an
affair with Beatle's manager Brian Epstein.
   ``I was his wife and I just know he wasn't homosexual,'' she
told the Post. ``I can say that for certain, but if he was bisexual
there was no reason he couldn't have told me beause we didn't think
there was anything wrong about that.''
   She acknowledged that both she and Lennon used drugs at one
time, but said they both had ``conquered it.''
   Sean Lennon, 12, called the book ``outlandish.''
   ``At first, I thought (it) was very serious, but then I realized
it was just a big joke,'' he told the Post.
   In the Times interview, Goldman admitted making some factual
errors in the book, but maintained there were no errors ``on which
a great deal turns, like the interpretation of an episode, or a
major point.''
   Ono told the Times: ``I think the book is trash. It's not even
good reading.''
   She planned to offer a rebuttal to the book, using excerpts from
Lennon interview tapes as well as comments from Julian Lennon and
others, on Wednesday night on a New York City radio station.

<HEAD>EPA Should Concentrate On Global Pollution Problems, Scientists
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should
change its approach and concentrate on early detection and
prevention of new pollution, say more than 40 scientists, according
to a report published today.
   The critical report, scheduled to be released in Washington this
week, says the agency's focus on cleaning up known pollution is
inadequate for coping with modern environmental problems, The
Boston Globe reported in today's editions.
   The report was commissioned 17 months ago by Lee Thomas, the
EPA's chief administrator.
   ``We really don't know how environmental changes are affecting
natural systems,'' said Alvin Alm, a former top EPA official who
directed the report. Alm now is president of Alliance Technologies
in Bedford, Mass.
   ``There are really dire consequences. We're worrying about small
problems now compared with the potential global impact of these
changes,'' he said.
   Alm said the EPA ``desperately needs'' a long-term research and
development program that takes into account consequences of
problems such as global warming.
   The report calls for an early detective system for environmental
problems and for the creation of an environmental research
institute that would be financed by the EPA but operated by a
university or other independent contractor.
   It also recommends making the position of assistant
administrator of EPA for research and development a civil service
job.
   The job has been held by political appointees since EPA was
formed in 1970 and no one has served more than three years since
then, the Globe said.
   Dr. Ellen Silbergeld of the Environmental Defense Fund, a
citizens' advocacy group, and one of those making the report, said
she and others involved have doubts about a new institute.
   ``The EPA has a dismal record at managing research, both
internal and external,'' she said.
   The report says that despite the EPA's ``original charter to
take a long-term view of human health and environmental quality,
EPA has had to devote a larger and larger share of its budget to
the support of near-term regulatory development required by
environmental law.''
   The report also said the agency should maintain the clean air
and clean waters programs mandated by Congress.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II traveled today to
the violence-wracked provincial capital of Matabeleland and
preached reconciliation and peace.
   ``It is only eight years since your struggle for national
independence (in Zimbabwe) was brought to an end,'' the Roman
Catholic pontiff said. ``Even after that, many people in
Matabeleland did not find true peace. ... The civilian population
continued to suffer from guerrilla warfare and other forms of
violence.''
   The pope celebrated Mass at Ascot Race Course on an altar
festooned with white Madonna lilies. Many in the crowd of 50,000
waited at the race track six hours for the Mass.
   The pope began the Mass speaking in Sindebele, the tribal
language of the Ndebele of Matabeleland.
   John Paul flew from Harare, the capital, to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's
second largest city and provincial capital of Matabeleland, early
today. He was welcomed by Joshua Nkomo, a senior minister in the
government and the province's political chief.
   The pope's one-day visit to this western province is the most
sensitive part of his three-day trip to Zimbabwe, which began
Saturday. The pope is to travel on to the black-governed countries
of Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique during his 10-day
tour of southern Africa.
   Before the Mass, John Paul was welcomed by Bishop Henry Karlen.
   In 1984, the Swiss-born Karlen and President Robert Mugabe
clashed after Karlen accused government troops of atrocities
involving hundreds of civilians in Matabeleland.
   Mugabe denied the allegations and accused the bishop of siding
with rebels.
   ``The people of Matabeleland have suffered much during the
liberation war,'' Karlen said in his welcoming speech. ``The blood
of 10 missionary martyrs of the diocese of Bulawayo has flowed into
the soil of this area. May this blood bear abundant fruit.''
   Until recently, Matabeleland was the center of a tribal-based
insurgency that began shortly after Zimbabwe gained independence in
April 1980. Hundreds of people were killed in the conflict between
the rebels and government troops, among them the 10 Catholic
missionaries.
   Suspected rebels shot and killed Killian Knoerl of the
Matabeleland diocese on April 19, hours after the government
announced a general amnesty for rebels. The government said 113
rebels surrendered under the amnesty and that there have been no
rebel-related killings since.
   The amnesty came four months after Mugabe and Nkomo, formerly
his chief political rival, signed a unity accord.
   Mugabe and Nkomo led rival guerrilla armies during the
seven-year war that led to white-ruled Rhodesia becoming
black-ruled Zimbabwe.
   Mugabe, a member of the Shona tribe that accounts for 70 percent
of Zimbabwe's 8.5 million people, accused Nkomo of controlling the
rebels in Matabeleland, Nkomo's Ndebele tribal stronghold. Nkomo
denied the charge.
   The Ndebele make up about one-quarter of Zimbabwe's population.

   Proving that time heals all wounds, a
lawman presided when this Gold Rush town paid tribute to Black
Bart, the Old West stagecoach robber famed for his calling card
poems.
   About 2,500 people turned out during the weekend for a parade,
barbecue and dance to celebrate the release of the ``Gentleman
Bandit'' from San Quentin Prison 100 years ago.
   Bill Claudino, a California Highway Patrol officer, was the
parade chairman.
   ``Some people might think it is a little odd to pay so much
attention to a stagecoach robber, but Black Bart really was quite a
dapper thief,'' Claudino said.
   Black Bart was the alias of Charles E. Bolles, who robbed 28
stages between 1875 to 1883 before he was caught and served five
years in prison.
   He was released on Jan. 21, 1888 but because January's weather
is foul here, the celebration was postponed until Saturday.
   San Andreas, the seat of Calaveras County, laid claim to the end
of the Black Bart legend because it sent him to San Quentin.
   A handkerchief and two shirt cuffs dropped during a stage holdup
at nearby Copperopolis was traced by laundry mark to Boles who
lived in San Francisco. When captured, he was wearing a derby,
diamond jewelry, a gold watch and twirling a cane.
   Black Bart became known for the poems he left behind at
robberies, all signed in the same manner. The first of several was
scribbled on the back of a freight waybill:
   ``I've labored long and hard for bread
   ``For honor and for riches
   ``But on my corns too long you've tread
   ``You fine-haired sons of bitches.''
   Below was the signature: ``Black Bart the PO8.''
   Bolles was never reported seen again after he left prison.

   Eastern Airlines officials say the elimination of
4,000 workers was the only way to end mounting losses, but union
leaders warned that the latest round of firings dooms the company's
ability to compete.
   Dozens punched their time cards for the last time here this
weekend as part of a cutback that eliminates Eastern service to 14
cities and drops the carrier's workforce to 30,000.
   Less than four years ago, Eastern had 42,000 workers.
   ``We're back on death watch again,'' said Katherine Ferer, a
vice chair of the Transport Workers Union representing flight
attendants.
   Eastern officials acknowledge the cuts are painful, but said
something had to be done.
   ``The fact is we have lost over a billion dollars in this
decade,'' said Robin Matell, the company's chief spokesman. ``We
have to take prudent, although admittedly painful, measures.''
   Union leaders say laying off employees will drive up labor costs
per flight because the less-senior workers being laid off were paid
less than those who remain.
   ``The last thing you want to do in the airline industry is
downsize,'' said Charles E. Bryan, president of District 100 of the
Machinists, Eastern's largest union with nearly 12,000 workers.
``Many of the costs are fixed, and the break-even yield goes way
up. It's a lose-lose proposition that just feeds on itself.
   Of the 4,000 jobs eliminated, 1,500 were non-union positions,
including management and clerical. Some 500 pilots positions are
being eliminated without layoffs by having pilots clear backlogs of
vacation time, and some 400 flight attendants are taking
one-to-six-month leaves of absence, the company said.
   A few hundred more flight attendants, mechanics, baggage
handlers and ramp agents are taking early retirement or simply
quit, Eastern said.
   Eastern is $2.5 billion in debt and its cash reserves dwindled
from $560 million to $420 million in the quarter ending June 30.
   President Phil Bakes said Eastern was cutting out money-losing
Western routes and its Kansas City hub, along with some sluggish
Caribbean routes. The company estimates the new cuts will save $100
million a year.
   The Houston-based Texas Air Corp., chaired by Frank Lorenzo,
took over Eastern two years ago.
   Eastern's unions will make arguments against the layoffs later
this month in the District Court of Appeals in Washington, which
allowed Eastern to go ahead with the layoffs after it posted a $4.7
million bond to pay back salaries if workers are later ordered
reinstated.

   More than 1,000 primary and secondary
school students fasted today as thousands of demonstrators marched
through Rangoon to press for an interim government to lead Burma to
democracy.
   Key opposition leaders jointly rejected the government's plan to
hold a general election, and reiterated demands for an interim
government. State-run Radio Rangoon said the State Council met with
the newly formed Commission on Elections to work out polling
details, naming Ba Htay as commission chairman.
   The students, age 10 to 17, began the 36-hour fast Sunday at the
Rangoon General Hospital compound. The students held up banners and
shouted ``Give Us Democracy!'' and ``Give Us Interim Government!''
They said their fast would end tonight.
   Meanwhile, many thousands of student-led demonstrators marched
through the capital to press for an interim government and
multiparty democracy.
   More soldiers were seen on the streets today, but they did not
interfere with the protesters, who dispersed peacefully.
   President Maung Maung has rejected the call for an interim
government. But Saturday he bowed to weeks of nationwide protests
and announced the ruling party would hold the first multiparty
general election since 1960.
   Parliament on Sunday authorized the government to amend the
constitution to permit a multiparty system and hold the election in
as little as six weeks.
   But the demonstrators clearly remain skeptical of the promise
and the protests have continued.
   Burma scholars note the present constitution is designed to
support single-party rule, and would have to be virtually scrapped
rather than amended to permit multiparty elections.
   Burma expert Josef Silverstein, contacted by The Associated
Press from Bangkok, Thailand, said the constitution gives the
president and central government great power, and enshrines the
rigid party policies known as the ``Burmese way to socialism.''
   Said another Burma specialist, Bertil Linter of Bangkok: ``It's
impossible to hold elections within the present constitution.''
   Opposition leaders Aung Gyi, former Defense Minister Tin Oo and
Aung San Suu Kyi issued their demand for an interim government in a
letter to Maung Maung. It was the first joint statement from the
three opposition leaders.
   None of the three have specified who should be in the interim
government, saying only it should comprise people outside the
ruling Burma Socialist Program Party who are ``acceptable to all
the people.'' They also have not said if they would be willing to
serve in a transition government.
   ``Since the government has lost the confidence of the nation,
people will have no confidence in the general elections to be held
by the government-appointed election supervision commission,'' the
statement said.
   It said when an interim government is formed, striking public
employees will return to work, Burma will regain normal economic
activity and general elections would be organized.
   Parliament set a target date of three months for the holding of
the multiparty elections, but empowered the government to make it
earlier or later if necessary.
   It also appointed an election commission comprised of three
retired civil servants, a retired army brigadier general and a
former member of Parliament. The men, all over 70 years of age, are
generally regarded as neutral.
   At least four are not members of the ruling party.
   The last multiparty elections were in 1960. The elected
government of Prime Minister U Nu was overthrown in a 1962 coup led
by Gen. Ne Win.
   Over the next 26 years, Ne Win and the military crushed dissent
and pursued rigid socialist policies that made resource-rich Burma
one of the world's poorest nations.
   Economic woes the past year have fueled nationwide protests in
which hundreds were killed. The protests forced the resignations of
Ne Win on July 23 and successor Sein Lwin Aug. 12.
   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19 as the country's first civilian
leader since 1962.
   Maung Maung has called for an end to the pro-democracy strikes
and warned that lawlessness and destruction of public property must
end immediately.
   He called for immediate removal of administrations set up by
Buddhist monks and students in towns nationwide where central
government control has disintegrated.

<HEAD>Students Angry Over Change In Oral Roberts U. Scholarship Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oral Roberts University medical students say
they feel betrayed by the cancellation of a scholarship program
funded after evangelist Oral Roberts said God would end his life
unless he raised $8 million.
   Although the television preacher-faith healer said the donations
would fund full scholarships for medical students at Oral Roberts
University, those scholarships turned out to be loans.
   New students at the Tulsa, Okla., school have been told the
university has canceled the scholarship program for them.
   Students also complained Roberts has pressured them to keep
quiet about their dissatisfaction, the Los Angeles Times reported
in today's editions.
   Several students said that at the semester's opening chapel
service, Roberts told them not to grumble, warning: ``Keep your
cotton-pickin' mouth shut!''
   Roberts, on his TV programs and in letters to donors this year,
has insisted he never promised the medical students anything beyond
one year's help. Officials in Roberts' ministry and the medical
school declined requests for comment.
   During last year's $8 million fund-raising drive, Roberts
repeatedly said the donations would fund full scholarships for
medical students.
   But the four-year scholarships turned out to require students to
work as medical missionaries for four years after graduation to
repay the $93,500 in scholarship funds.
   The contract also said: ``ORU makes no promise or warranty
whatsoever that additional medical school scholarship loans will be
made in future years.'' ``Future years'' is not defined.
   In a memo Feb. 1, however, the medical school students were
informed by Assistant Dean Milton C. Olsen that the Healing Team
Scholarship Loan program would be canceled at the end of the
1987-88 academic year.
   Students who stayed in the medical school for the next three
years would have to pay as much as $71,000. Those who transferred
were told they would have to pay back the money they had already
received at 18 percent interest.
   The ``restated loan agreement'' also prohibits students from
borrowing from ``any source other than ORU ... except with written
approval of President Oral Roberts and the Board of Regents.''
   At least 25 returning students have sought legal advice
regarding the new document. Twelve have transferred and about half
of the 85 who received scholarships in past years have refused to
sign the new contract.
   The more than $8 million raised in last year's drive was not
just for the students, but for the cost of operating the medical
school for one year, Oral Roberts and his son Richard said on the
``Richard Roberts Live'' television program in March.
   Jack Hayford, pastor of the Church on the Way in the Los Angeles
and a member of the school's Board of Regents, said he thought the
students should be grateful for any attempt to continue the
scholarships.
   ``A small group of med students feels there's been some kind of
a breach of trust,'' Hayford said. ``In a technical sense,
perhaps.''
   Jerry Collins, the Orlando, Fla., race-track owner whose $1.3
million gift pushed Roberts over the $8 million goal just before
the March 31, 1987 deadline, said the medical school was a
financial failure from the start.
   ``They needed cash flow, and I never thought the money would be
exclusively for the med students,'' he said.
   Regarding Roberts' fund-raising pitch, Collins said: ``I don't
approve of what's happening there, but I'm for helping education.''

   Minister of Culture Jack Lang today named Monique
Barbaroux as the new director general of the Comedie Francaise, the
prestigious national theater founded in 1690 under Louis XIV.
   Mrs. Barbaroux will direct both the main theater, located
between the Palais Royale and the Louvre, and the Odeon on the Left
Bank.
   The new director general formerly was in charge of music and
theater administration in the Ministry of Culture.
   The repertoire of the Comedie Francaise traditionally has
performed the French classics, with strictly defined
interpretations of works by playwrights such as Racine,
Beaumarchais and Moliere, who founded the company in the 17th
century.
   The company has in recent years ventured into foreign and 20th
century authors such as Pirandello, Claudel and Anouilh.

<HEAD>American Rabbi: Message of Hope for East German Jews On Rosh
Hashana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Rabbi Herman Dicker says he's bringing a
message of hope to East Germany's tiny and isolated Jewish
community, but he says he'd like to see the communist government do
more for them.
   Dicker conducted a Rosh Hashana service for about 200 Jews
Sunday evening, as part of his two-week stay in East Berlin for the
high holidays. Rosh Hashana is the Jewish new year. The country's
practicing Jews, estimated to number between 450 and 600, have no
permanent rabbi.
   ``They (East German Jews) are somewhat isolated,'' the New York
rabbi told The Associated Press. ``I want to give them a feeling
they belong to a group. I'm bringing a message of hope.''
   While Dicker says he believes that ``things are loosening up,''
there is still more East Germany could do for Jews. ``An
improvement is possible,'' the 74-year-old rabbi said in the
interview in front of the Temple of Peace synagogue, the only
synagogue still in use in East Berlin.
   ``There is a recognition on the part of the officials that they
can do more than they have done in the past,'' Dicker said when
asked about Jewish life in East Germany. ``Things could be better.''
   He did not specify what improvements are needed.
   While emphasizing that part of his stay would include a ``spirit
of criticism,'' he said he did not wish to become embroiled in a
political dispute and said he had been well received.
   He is in East Berlin under an agreement worked out between East
Germany and the World Jewish Congress for the high holidays.
   Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the congress, said in July that
after years of pressure, there is a ``good chance'' that East
Germany would agree this fall to pay reparations to Holocaust
survivors.
   An estimated 6 million Jews died during Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich, and until now East Germany has refused to pay reparations.
   East Germany has agreed to restore a second East Berlin
synagogue that has fallen into disrepair.
   Dicker, now a research librarian at the Jewish Theological
Seminary in New York, was born in Hungary and was educated in
Berlin until 1936 when he was forced to flee by the Nazis. He
served as a chaplain with the U.S. Army in World War II and
participated in the liberation of a number of concentration camps,
including Mauthausen in Austria.
   Dicker said he would be ``a little sad'' to leave East Berlin's
Jews, a majority of them elderly people who survived the Holocaust.
   ``My ambition is great, but my effectiveness will be limited,''
he said, noting that Sunday's service was his first in a communist
country.
   The World Jewish Congress is searching for a rabbi to serve in
East Germany on what it calls a ``long-term appointment.''
   Dicker said he hopes the congress can find a such a rabbi.
   However, he added that finding a rabbi would be difficult. ``The
person would have to be part of Schiller and Goethe, but also be
horrified by Hitler.''

<TEXT>
   The pilot of a TWA jetliner
hijacked to Beirut in 1985 testified today that Mohammed Ali Hamadi
fired the shot that killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Sethem.
   But under questioning by defense lawyers, Capt. John Testrake
said he did not actually see Hamadi pull the trigger. And he said
either of the two hijackers could have led Stethem to a cabin door
where he was shot.
   ``It was my recollection that the most violent of the two men
was in the companion way. I was in extreme stress and not taking
notes of these details, it's only recollection,'' Testrake said.
   Testrake testified he believed Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem
who is on trial on charges of air piracy and murder, was the most
violent of the two hijackers.
   The pilot said he had a chance to get a closer look at defendant
during a court recess. After the break, he told the court:
   ``I want to make an important statement. ... I did say before
that one of the two (hijackers) appeared to do more of the
communicating and the other more of the violence.
   ``And looking at this man now, I was struck that this man fit
the second of the two descriptions... that this is the man who I
recall had stood in the forward entryway and shot Stethem.''
   Under questioning, however, Testrake said he could not recall if
Hamadi or the other hijacker was with Stethem at the time of the
shooting.
   Hamadi has acknowledged being one of the hijackers, but denied
killing Stethem, of Waldorf, Md. If convicted, Hamadi faces life
imprisoment.
   Testrake, of Richmond, Mo., was at the controls of Flight 847
when it was hijacked June 14, 1985. The flight from Athens to Rome
was diverted to Beirut and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17
days.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 after
explosives were found in his luggage.
   His brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is believed to head the Holy
Warriors for Freedom, which claimed responsibility for the Jan. 17,
1987 kidnapping of Rudolf Cordes, 55, Beirut manager for the
Hoechst AG chemical company.
   In Beirut today, a letter attributed to Cordes said the hostage
expected to be freed today and linked his fate with Mohammed
Hamadi. The German-language letter, which could not be
authenticated, said, ``Please inform my family, but please do
everything regarding Mohammed. Please help. The hostage-takers
expect something, especially now that I am freed.''
   However, a statement accompanying the later and signed by the
Holy Warriors for Freedom spoke of a 48-hour release period. The
discrepancy could not be explained.
   A third Hamadi brother, Abbas, was convicted by a West German
court in April of complicity in the kidnappings of Cordes and West
German engineer Alfred Schmidt in a bid to free Mohammed.
   Abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Schmidt was released
a year ago in what the Holy Warriors for Freedom called a goodwill
gesture.
   Also today, Testrake described the moments after takeoff from
Athens Airport.
   ``About five minutes after takeoff I turned off the seatbelt
light. Almost immediately after that we began to hear strange
noises that came from behind the cockpit bulkhead. I asked the
co-pilot to check.''
   He said the co-pilot looked through a peep-hole in the cockpit
door and told him: ``We have been hijacked.''
   Testrake said the co-pilot had seen a man brandishing ``a
chrome-plated pistol.''
   He said the men kicked violently at the door, breaking a panel
at the bottom, then burst into the cockpit carrying the pistol and
two hand grenades.
   Testrake said he was not beaten, but that his flight engineer,
Benjamin C. Zimmermann, of Cascade, Idaho, was repeatedly struck
with the pistol.
   ``Blood was coming from his head and from his shirt,'' Testrake
said.
   He said the hijackers beat the engineer and passengers even
after the hijackers' demands to fly to Beirut were met.
   ``There was no reason for any of the beating because we were
complying with their demands,'' Testrake testified.

   George Bush said today that Frederic V. Malek
was ``without one ounce of bigotry or prejudice'' even though he
resigned from the Republican National Committee because of a report
that he tallied the number of Jews in a federal agency for
President Nixon in the early 1970s.
   Reporters shouted questions about Malek's departure as the vice
president embarked on a five-state tour including major industrial
centers. He said he stood by a statement he issued Sunday, and
expressed similar sentiments in a conversation with Malek.
   ``I know this man, and I know him to be without one ounce of
bigotry or prejudice in his makeup,'' Bush said.
   Malek, who had been deputy chairman of the Republican National
Committee since Aug. 19, had admitted compiling the data in 1971
but denied Sunday he had any part in the demotion of government
employees because of their religious affiliation. He said he
resigned in order to keep the campaign focused on the issues.
   In a separate statement, Bush said: ``I respect Fred Malek's
decision. I know him to be a most honorable man without a trace of
bigotry in his makeup ... I condemn any vestiges of anti-Semitism,
prejudice or bigotry and so, I believe, does Fred Malek.''
   The Washington Post story and the resignation follow a report
last week that members of an ethnic coalition for Bush were
associated with anti-Semitic and fascistic activities.
   A co-chairman, Jerome Brentar, resigned after disclosures he was
active in the defense of John Demjanjuk, a former Ohio autoworker
convicted in Israel of being a Nazi death camp guard. The
Washington Jewish Week also reported that Brentar denied the
existence of the Holocaust.
   ``The moral clock is ticking for the Bush campaign,'' Rep.
Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said Sunday, noting that Jews around
the country were preparing to celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish
New Year.
   ``How can we trust George Bush to be a friend of Israel?'' he
asked.
   Malek, a Harvard business school graduate known for his
management abilities, was chosen by Bush late in April to run the
Republican National Convention.
   Before the convention, Bush announced that he would place Malek
in the RNC position. At the same time, Bush spurned Chairman Frank
Fahrenkopf's offer to resign. The move, however, gave Bush greater
control of the party.
   ``I think Malek going up there will maximize coordination
between the campaign and the important functions of the RNC,'' Bush
said at the time.
   The committee voted in Malek the day after the convention in New
Orleans.
   The Post reported Sunday that former President Nixon had ordered
Malek in 1971 to investigate what was described in notes as a
``Jewish cabal'' at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   At the time, Malek was Nixon's White House personnel chief and
had been assigned to evaluate the BLS staff because Nixon thought
the bureau was interpreting unemployment data in an unfavorable
light.
   On July 27, 1971, Malek reported to H.R. Haldeman, Nixon's chief
of staff, that 13 of 35 top BLS officials were Jewish. Post
reporters found the memo last week in the archives of Nixon's
presidency.
   Less than two months after Malek's memo to Haldeman, two senior
officials who were Jewish were moved to less visible positions in
the Labor Department. They were Peter Henle, then chief economist
for BLS, and Harold Goldstein, then director of current employment
analysis.
   In his statement Sunday, Malek said, referring to the demotion
of anyone for religious reasons, ``I find that kind of action _ or
even the suggestion that I engaged peripherally in that kind of
effort _ to be morally wrong and totally out of bounds.''
   Malek, who worked as a senior executive for the Marriott Corp.,
came to Washington with the Nixon administration.
   While with the administration in 1972, Malek oversaw a program
of redirecting federal grants to benefit Nixon's re-election
efforts.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. military court began hearings
today to determine whether a Navy captain should be court-martialed
for failing to rescue Vietnamese refugees who said they ate human
flesh to survive at sea.
   Capt. Alexander G. Balian was relieved as skipper of the USS
Dubuque last month Vietnamese refugees said they resorted to murder
and cannibalism after the Navy ship refused to take them aboard in
the South China Sea in June.
   The Vietnamese eventually were rescued by fishermen and are in a
refugee camp on the Philippine island of Palawan.
   Today's proceedings at Subic Bay Naval Base were a preliminary
session and were adjourned for two weeks to allow Balian to prepare
his defense, according to Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri.
   The hearing, which is the first step leading to a possible
court-martial, was conducted by Cmdr J. E. Halvorson, a circuit
military judge, Mukri said. He gave no other details.
   Balian faces charges of ``wrongfully failing to render
appropriate assistance'' to the refugees and of dereliction of duty
by not properly investigating the refugees' condition.
   Navy officials decided to begin proceedings against Balian, 48,
after he refused to appear at an admiral's mast, a closed-door
session during which an admiral serves as the only judge, sources
in Washington said.
   The Dubuque, an amphibious landing ship, was sailing toward the
Persian Gulf on June 9 when it encountered a boat filled with
Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea. The Navy said the
Dubuque gave the refugees several hundred pounds of food and water
and navigational aids, but did not take them aboard because Balian
judged their boat to be seaworthy.
   The refugees told Philippine and United Nations officials that
after encountering the American ship, they drifted for weeks and
many of them starved.
   Philippine and U.S. officials quoted the survivors as saying
they killed and ate three of their companions after being turned
away by the Dubuque. They said they also ate two other companions
who had starved.
   Only 52 of the 109 Vietnamese survived the 37-day crossing. They
said they encountered the Dubuque 19 days after they left Vietnam.

   Two IRA bombs today badly
damaged the home of Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, head of Northern
Ireland's civil service, but Bloomfield and his family escaped
serious injury.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the attack
in a statement issued through its Republican Press Center in
Belfast. The IRA said other civil servants in the British province
should resign their posts.
   Police said two bombs exploded at about 6:15 a.m. outside the
house in Helen's Bay, County Down, on the eastern outskirts of
Belfast. They said the blasts ripped gaping holes in the brickwork
and shattered windows in nearby homes.
   Bloomfield, his wife Mary and their son Timothy were asleep in
the back of the house when the bombs went off, police said. They
said the family was taken to a hospital. They were released after
being treated for shock.
   ``There was a clear intention to kill Sir Kenneth and anybody
else in the house at the time,'' said a spokesman for the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, who requested anonymity. ``They intended to
completely blow up the house.''
   A third bomb was defused by British army experts, police said.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the attack was ``yet
another example of the total ruthlessness of the IRA.''
   ``This is the first time we have had a direct bomb attack on
civil servants working in the Northern Ireland Office and it is a
matter of great concern to us,'' she told reporters in Perth,
Scotland.
   ``It just shows the IRA are now after civilians ... They don't
mind whether the civilians have children _ they will still go and
attack.''
   British news reports said Bloomfield had no police or army guard
at his home, which is 150 feet from the road 10 miles east of
Belfast.
   In its statement today, the IRA warned other civil servants
involved in ``formulating British military strategy or advising the
administration in this field to resign the posts or face the
consequences.''
   The IRA said Bloomfield was ``fortunate that it was only his
spoils-of-war that were damaged.''
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to end British rule in the
predominantly Protestant province and unite it with the mainly
Roman Catholic Irish Republic. Sixty-nine people have died in
Northern Ireland so far this year in sectarian violence.

   Scores of religious fundamentalists are
heeding an author's predictions that a prelude to Christ's second
coming is near and some are selling their worldly goods to prepare
for the end of the world.
   The ``Rapture'' is expected to strike before sunset Tuesday,
according to the book ``88 Reasons Why The Rapture Will Be In
1988,'' which was written by former NASA rocket engineer Edgar C.
Wisenant.
   He used mathematical calculations and biblical interpretations
to pinpoint the event to the 48 hours of this year's Jewish New
Year _ 40 years and 120 days after Israel became a nation on May
14, 1948.
   According to his book, millions of the faithful will be
suddenly, silently called to Heaven this week and global disasters
will follow.
   In West Virginia, a minister reported a baptism boom and in Ohio
a retired firefighter spent $3,700 for a newspaper ad to tell
people that Jesus Christ will return this week to take believers to
heaven.
   Ed Koval said the cost of the ad in The Blade of Toledo was ``a
pittance, because if this is true and it does come to pass, what's
money anyway?''
   Most religious leaders say there is no evidence to support
claims that the Rapture will occur this week.
   Randy Thompson, director of the Christian Studies Center in New
Haven, Conn., said the Rapture appeals mainly to fundamentalist
Christians who interpret the Bible as the literal word of God.
   ``It's just a sign of the times _ people are looking for
reassurance that it's going to happen,'' said Dr. E.S. Hanrahan,
dean of the College of Science at Marshall University in
Huntington, W. Va.
   Rabbi Victor Urecki of B'Nai Jacob, a Conservative Jewish
synagogue in Charleston, W.Va., said he was being swamped with
calls from Christians as Rosh Hashana neared.
   ``I've been telling people who call that I'll see them
Tuesday,'' he said. ``I'm not too worried about it.''
   But some Christians are taking it seriously and are selling off
their valuables in anticipation that they will soon be in the
Kingdom of God.
   Durham, N.C., television station WTVD reported that several
residents last week put their cars and a boat up for sale in
anticipation of the event.
   Many preachers talked about the Rapture in their Sunday sermons.
   ``Will it happen? I'm not a date-setter ... but I'm not a fool,
either,'' said the Rev. Max Allman of Peoples Memorial Christian
Church in Burlington, N.C., who urged worshippers to ``check out
their priorities.''
   Allman, pastor of Peoples Memorial, said the event had created a
revival at his church, with attendance doubling in recent weeks to
more than 700 at Sunday and 350 at weeknight services.
   ``This has made them (people) understand that in a flash this
could all be over,'' he said.
   ``The Lord is coming back. I'm looking at it about any time
now,'' said Jerry McLamb, 37, of Coats, N.C. He said he and workers
at his automobile engine shop had rushed to complete customers'
orders last week, possibly their last.

<HEAD>Bush Names National Security Panel, Attacks Dukakis on Defense</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush today named a
bipartisan, 13-member campaign panel to advise him on national
security issues, and both immediately accused Democrat Michael
Dukakis of lacking the capacity to handle world crises.
   One panelist, Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security
adviser to Democratic President Carter, said that of the two
current presidential candidates, ``George Bush is the one who can
best fashion an effective, bipartisan foreign policy.''
   Bush said Dukakis would question the Reagan administration's
direct initiatives in Grenada, the Persian Gulf or Libya and rely
instead on the United Nations or other international organizations.
   ``We cannot abdicate our responsibility for leadership,'' Bush
said.
   Brent Scowcroft, who was President Ford's national security
adviser, said the Democratic nominee ``has demonstrated neither the
capacity nor the instincts'' to handle world crises.
   Bush said the 13 panelists will provide him with ``sound advice
and counsel'' in his campaign for the White House. He noted they
were both Democrats and Republicans but said that on defense
matters, ``they are neither Republicans nor Democrats _ they are
Americans.''
   Besides Brzezinski and Scowcroft, the panelists include Henry A.
Kissinger and Alexander Haig, former secretaries of state; former
ambassador Anne Armstrong; former White House chief of staff Howard
Baker; Melvin Laird and Donald Rumsfeld, former secretaries of
defense; Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and
Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, and retired
Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., former chief of naval operations.
   Former U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who has endorsed the
Republican ticket, did not accept an invitation to join the panel
because of a potential conflict with her job as a syndicated
newspaper columnist, Bush spokeswoman Alixe Glen said.

   A burglary suspect tried a rooftop escape, but
fell into a chimney and was stuck there for three hours before
being rescued by police.
   Wayne Mitchell, 20, was not seriously hurt in his 30-foot fall
down the narrow shaft, police said.
   He and five other people allegedly broke into a leather goods
store in the Bronx on Sunday morning, but while the other five were
caught near the store, Mitchell took off across a roof, followed by
two police officers.
   He fell down the chimney of a three-story building adjoining a
one-story doughnut shop on the corner.
   Officers from the Emergency Service Unit first tried to pull him
up with a rope. Then they knocked a hole in the rear wall of the
doughnut shop, but couldn't reach him.
   Finally, they went to an adjacent grocery store, where the
chimney shaft ended above a water heater.
   Emergency Service Officer John Dallara used a jackhammer to chop
a hole in a concrete wall. Mitchell was then pulled through the
hole.
   ``Thank you, thank you,'' he said as police extricated him.
   ``You're welcome,'' Dallara replied, ``and you're under arrest.''

<HEAD>100,000 Cheer Mexican Independence At L.A. Parade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 people cheered a parade of
beauty queens, movie stars and floats through seven miles of city
streets to mark Mexico's struggle for independence from Spain.
   ``This holiday is to Mexicans what the Fourth of July is to
Americans,'' Juan Arellano, who moved to California more than 50
years ago, said Sunday.
   ``Grito de Dolores'' marks Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla's
impassioned speech in 1810 urging his peasant congregation in the
city of Dolores to take up arms against Spanish monarchs who had
ruled Mexico for more than three centuries.
   By 1821, the Mexicans had won their independence.
   Sal Lopez, 74, whose parents immigrated from Mexico in 1921, has
organized the parade for the past 25 years and has attended twice
as many.
   ``When the parade was first organized, it was nothing but a
bunch of brewing companies that put a couple of Mexican flags on
their trucks and drove down First Street, but as the Mexican
population here increases, the parade gets bigger and bigger,'' he
said.
   Authorities estimated 100,000 people turned out in the
predominately Hispanic community of East Los Angeles.
   The parade featured Indian dancers in glistening silver and gold
robes with anklets of dried nuts that could be heard rattling above
the sound of the trumpets and guitars of mariachis.
   Men thrust their fists in the air and shouted ``Viva la
Independencia'' as military bands marched by and fans swooned over
the singing group Menudo and such Mexican movie stars as Parade
Grand Marshal Richard Iniquez.
   Mexican beauty queens smiled at the crowd from colorful, 30-foot
floats.
   About 30 protesters shouted as Romeo Flores, Mexico's consul in
Los Angeles, passed, demanding the appointment of Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas as president of Mexico. Cardenas, the National Democratic
Front candidate, recently was defeated by Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, who protesters said cheated his way into office.

<HEAD>U.S. Destroyer Rescues Fishermen, Vincennes Leaves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. destroyer rescued three
shipwrecked fishermen and was searching for a fourth after their
two small craft foundered in rough seas in the Gulf of Oman,
American naval sources said today.
   A Navy official said the destroyer John Hancock had just
finished escorting two U.S.-chartered cargo vessels out of the
Persian Gulf when its patrol helicopter spotted the fishermen
clinging to pieces of wreckage.
   The fishermen were two Pakistanis and a United Arab Emirates
citizen, all from the Emirates port of Fujairah.
   The three men were quoted as saying one of their craft was
swamped in the heavy seas and the second sank after trying to come
to its rescue.
   The missing man was another Emirates citizen, said the Navy
official, who asked not to be identified.
   The 7,800-ton John Hancock, based at Mayport, Fla., is one of
five U.S. warships scheduled to leave the gulf within the next two
weeks. All will be replaced by ships now on their way to the gulf.
   It was the second reported rescue of fishermen by a U.S. warship
in the past month. In August, the missile cruiser Vincennes picked
up eight Iranians who had been adrift for eight days in the Gulf of
Oman. They later were repatriated.
   The Vincennes, which on July 3 mistakenly shot down an Iranian
jetliner, killing all 290 aboard, left the gulf region Sunday for
its home port of San Diego, Calif., a week after it was originally
scheduled to leave, U.S. officials said.
   The departure of the Vincennes represents the first U.S. force
reduction in the gulf _ from 27 to 26 warships _ since the
Iran-Iraq cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. U.S. Navy sources
confirmed that there were no plans to replace the 9,600-ton Aegis
cruiser.
   Navy sources, who demanded anonymity, said the Vincennes was
ordered to delay its departure after an Arab gulf country objected
to the Vincennes being pulled out while the Iran-Iraq cease-fire
talks in Geneva remained stalled.
   The sources declined to identify the Arab government or say why
the Vincennes was leaving now. The Geneva talks have continued to
show no significant progress.
   U.S. officials in Washington said the Vincennes was being
withdrawn because its long-range radar and weapons capability ``is
no longer needed there.''
   As the latest U.S. Navy-escorted tanker convoy reached Kuwait
overnight, that country's top tanker official said the cease-fire
in the 8-year-old war does not mean an end to its reliance on U.S.
and other foreign flags to protect its ships.
   ``Kuwaiti tankers will continue to sail under U.S., Soviet and
British flags. The reflagging is a purely economic policy and has
nothing to do with the war,'' Abdel-Fattah Al-Bader, chairman of
the state-run Kuwait Oil Tanker Co., was quoted as saying in an
interview with the newspaper Al-Watan.
   The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union have all
reflagged vessels and protected Kuwaiti shipping from Iranian
attack in the gulf during the past year.
   One of the 11 U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers, the 46,723-ton
carrier Gas Princess, arrived in Kuwait overnight, escorted by the
U.S. missile frigate Nicholas. It was the 63rd such convoy this
year and the 85th since the reflagging began in July 1987.

   A gun battle at a wake left two men dead
and three others wounded, authorities said.
   ``Both may have been shot by each other, although the
possibility of another gunman does exist,'' police said in a
statement. No other suspects had been identified or arrested.
   Authorities are investigating the possibility that the men, both
Albanian-Americans, were killed by two or three suspects, police
Sgt. David Misak said.
   Fran Gojcha, 52, of Sterling Heights and Fran Nicha, 27, of
Detroit were pronounced dead at Detroit Receiving Hospital after
the shootings Sunday outside the Polish National Alliance Hall in
the Detroit enclave, police said.
   Two other men attending the wake were treated at North Detroit
General Hospital and released. A woman walking near the hall was
hit by a stray bullet and was reported in serious condition at
Henry Ford Hospital.
   The victims were attending a wake for Mark Dedvukaj, 65, of
Hamtramck, who died two weeks ago in Yugoslavia and was buried
there.
   Gjeka Gjelaj, 40, who also was at the wake, said one of the
shooting victims were ``dishonored'' by the other six months ago.
Gjelaj said one man had carried the Albanian flag in a wedding
after the other had been chosen earlier.
   The man whom Gjelaj said had been dishonored confronted the flag
bearer at the wake and said, ``The time has come to pay what you
owe.''
   Both left the hall, drew guns and began shooting, Gjelaj said.
Investigators have not recovered the weapons, although 15 to 20
shell casings were found at the scene.

<TEXT>
   Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's brigantine
Niagara was lowered slowly into the waters of Presque Isle Bay with
a new mission _ ``official flagship'' for Pennsylvania.
   The launching of the restored ship Saturday came 175 years to
the day after Perry's fleet defeated the British in the Battle of
Lake Erie and issued the famous War of 1812 dispatch, ``We have met
the enemy and they are ours.''
   ``We are starting a new page in Pennsylvania's history, and you
all are a part of it,'' Gov. Robert Casey told several thousand
people gathered for the launching ceremony.
   Casey's wife, Ellen, lifted a bottle of Erie County wine and
struck the 182-foot, 278-ton restored ship, bedecked with the
American flag and Perry's battle flag, ``Don't Give Up the Ship.''
   Brent Glass, executive director of the Pennsylvania Historical
and Museum Commission, said the weekend festivities went smoothly
overall.
   ``We admire today a great hero, Oliver Hazard Perry,'' Glass
told a crowd during the launching ceremony. ``But also remember
those men invisible to history _ the 155 men who served on the
Niagara.''
   Casey called the Niagara ``the cornerstone of new development
projects already planned at Erie's bayfront.'' The ship was
restored for the fourth time with $3.8 million in state and private
funds.
   The Niagara will be outfitted by next spring with 118-foot and
113-foot masts, square rigging, about 22,000 square feet of
polyester sail and 20 aluminum cannon.
   It will then tour the Great Lakes and East Coast ports as
Pennsylvania's flagship.

   Chicago & North Western commuters, who endured
hours of delays in their last ride with the railway, enjoyed a much
smoother commute today, a railroad spokesman said.
   This morning's commute went ``perfectly,'' said Chris Knapton, a
spokesman for Metra, the Chicago-area commuter rail agency that
buys service from C&NW.
   ``All the trains are running on time,'' Knapton said.
   Friday's evening rush hour was disrupted by a one-day strike of
the 2,600 members of the United Transportation Union. The strike
was ended Friday night by a congressionally imposed settlement, but
President Reagan signed the bill too late to allow usual train
service to resume.
   The C&NW serves about 41,000 commuters in suburban Chicago and
has freight operations in 10 states.
   Railroad officials were forced to scramble to put together train
crews because about half the C&NW conductors failed to report for
work once Reagan signed the bill.
   ``We told all our members to go back to work when the president
signed the emergency board recommendations'' approved by the House
and Senate, said Robert Reppe Jr., president of UTU Local 577,
which represents 382 Chicago-area brakemen and conductors.
   Trains began running on schedule Saturday as union members went
back to their jobs, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A wind-whipped fire that destroyed
13 homes and burned pleasure boats on a lake forced residents of
this affluent Gold Rush country town to evacuate a second time
today.
   The fire was fanned by 30 mph gusts and fueled by drought-dry
bush, wood roofs and propane tanks which exploded like small bombs,
said state Department of Forestry spokesman Charlie Jakobs. Flames
destroyed 20 to 30 structures, including 13 homes.
   ``The fire laid down a little during the night but picked up
this morning,'' he said of the blaze in the Sierra Nevada foothills.
   More than 1,220 federal, state and local firefighters were on
the fire lines today in one of California's most scenic and
historic areas, Jakobs said.
   Residents of this mountain town of 4,500 people 45 miles
northeast of Sacramento and the tiny town of Rough and Ready were
evacuated Sunday, and Highway 49 was closed.
   They were allowed to begin returning home this morning, but were
ordered evacuated again later.
   Nevada County officials declared a state of emergency,
initiating a process to make the county eligible for more state and
federal assistance.
   Most schools in the area were closed. Thick smoke made it unsafe
to operate school buses and the Red Cross needed some schools for
evacuation centers.
   A firefighter suffered minor hand burns when flames engulfed his
bulldozer, forcing him to wrap himself in an asbestos blanket and
take refuge under his vehicle.
   Meanwhile, a new fire broke out less than a half mile from the
main blaze and burned 700 acres by early today, said Erin Connelly,
spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. She estimated the overall
acreage at 12,000.
   The main fire, which began Sunday morning along Highway 49 about
30 miles northwest of Nevada City, was apparently caused by an
illegal burn of debris, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Ann
Dow.
   Before their evacuation, weary, soot-smeared homeowners used
chain saws and hoses in an effort to keep the fire from spreading.
   ``We're ready to leave if we have to, but until then we'll stay
and help out,'' resident Gary Hultquist, 41, said Sunday night as
he helped hose down a neighbor's burning house. ``Everything you
got could go up in flames.''
   Some made sure families and animals were safe, then returned to
battle the blaze after nightfall as hot spots glowed in the hills.
   ``Nobody expected it to come in fast like this,'' said Mike
Fitzgerald, 38, said as he cut down a large, smoldering tree in his
yard.
   He looked sadly at a neighbor's house that had caught fire and
burned as flames hopscotched through the area.
   ``God, what a heartache. It wasn't that nice a house. It was
just a house, but it was their home,'' Fitzgerald said.
   Firefighter Bernie Paul, 31, suffered hand burns after fire
swept over his bulldozer.
   ``I thought I was done for more than once,'' Paul said. ``It
feels good to be alive.''
   The fire burned southwest, straddling Highway 29 and crossing
the South Fork of the Yuba River.
   When it reached Lake Wildwood, it skipped through the community,
burning yards and oak trees between large houses, some valued at $1
million.
   In some places, flames reached the lake, igniting marina
railings, several boats and a dock or platform in the water.
   ``It's scary. It started a long ways away but came in in a
snap,'' said Hultquist, snapping his fingers.
   Many homes on the north side of the lake were saved, partly
because firefighters or residents hosed them down. Some of the
fleeing homeowners, who formed a slow, five-mile-long line of
traffic out of the area, left sprinklers running in yards or on
roofs.
   Evacuees were taken to several schools and other temporary
shelters in Nevada City and Grass Valley, both about 10 miles east
of Lake Wildwood. Pets and livestock were transported to the Nevada
County Fairgrounds in Nevada City, state Department of Forestry
spokesman Paul Alford said.
   Firefighters on Sunday were hampered by steep terrain,
temperatures in the upper 80s and 40-mph gusts.
   ``The wind is our biggest enemy out here today,'' Jakobs said.
``We had a solid front of fire about a half-mile long moving at a
rapid rate through dense brush and timber.''
   The wind drove smoke and ash into downtown Sacramento.
   The fire also knocked out power to about 10,000 customers,
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis promised a foreign policy
today that would ``restore respect for American leadership in a
changing world'' and declared that Republican rival George Bush had
failed in combating trade deficits, terrorism and drug trafficking.
   The Democratic nominee began a three-day campaign trip focusing
on national security, defense and foreign affairs _ three areas in
which he has vulnerable to attack by his Republican rival.
   His aides said Dukakis planned to deal with U.S.-Soviet
relations in Chicago on Tuesday and with military policy in
Washington on Wednesday.
   In a speech today at a union hall in Philadelphia, the
Massachusetts governor said his three key points would be a strong
domestic economy that would bolster the U.S. position in world
trade, unwavering opposition to terrorism and an expanded effort to
halt international drug trafficking.
   ``In each of these three areas, George Bush has failed,''
Dukakis said in prepared remarks. ``I want to beat our foreign
competitors; he's willing to settle for second best. I want to
crack down on terrorism; he knuckled under to the Ayatollah. I want
a real war on drugs; his answer to drug kingpins like Noriega is J.
Danforth Quayle.''
   Dukakis criticized Bush's role in a long list of Reagan
administration policies, ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to
cutbacks in federal funds for state and local drug programs and
support for Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian leader who is under
U.S. indictment for alleged drug trafficking.
   ``Why haven't you explained to the American people, to our
parents and children, to our law enforcement officers and to
victims of drug-related crimes, why the United States government
had General Noriega on its payroll?'' Dukakis asked.
   ``What kind of judgment is this?'' Dukakis asked. ``What kind of
priorities are these? What kind of strategy for restoring respect
for America and protecting our national security can we expect from
Mr. Bush. My friends, we need answers, and we need better
leadership from the next president than we are going to get from
George Bush.''
   He accused the Reagan administration of ``yielding control of
America's economic future to bankers in Tokyo and Bonn.'' He
promised to enforce the new trade law, encourage better
labor-management relations and help business invest in new
technology and research.
   ``The primary foreign policy objective of the Dukakis
administration can be stated very simply: to restore respect for
American leadership in a changing world,'' Dukakis said.
   He promised a strong military, a growing economy and ``strong
and decisive leadership that understands and knows how to cope with
change.''
   From Philadelphia, Dukakis was heading to Ohio to visit a
General Electric plant in Cincinnati which builds jet engines for
the Stealth bomber, which Dukakis supports.
   The three states on the governor's current campaign swing
account for 72 electoral college votes, or more than a quarter of
the 270 votes needed to elect the next president.
   During the weekend, Dukakis met with Democratic congressional
experts on defense matters to prepare for his trip. After their
Sunday meeting, they criticized President Reagan for vetoing a
defense spending bill that won broad, bipartisan support in
Congress and had the backing of several administration officials.
   ``What you see here is an example of the way we're going to make
national security policy beginning in January 1989,'' Dukakis said.
``With a president and a Congress that work together.''
   Dukakis and the congressmen accused Reagan of vetoing the bill
to give GOP nominee George Bush fodder for his attempts to
characterize Dukakis as naive on defense issues.
   ``The vice president's political team said let's play political
football with the nation's defense,'' said former presidential
candidate Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee. ``I think it's
outrageous.''
   Among those at Dukakis' side were Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and
Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairmen of the Senate and House Armed
Services Committees, respectively.
   Nunn, Aspin and several others at the meeting agreed that Bush
has been successful in painting Dukakis as weak on defense but said
they expected the Democratic nominee to counter those efforts
successfully this week.

<TEXT>
   Shivering firefighters
rejoiced as snow eased their battle against blazes that have
blackened more than 1 million acres, but a forecast for warm, dry
weather kept them on guard.
   ``I just love it. It means we might get to go home earlier,''
firefighter John Massey said Sunday as snow dusted much of
Yellowstone National Park.
   Three to 4 inches fell in areas south of Mammoth Hot Springs.
Humidity was as high as 90 percent, and temperatures in the mid-30s
combined with winds of up to 30 mph for a wind chill index of 19
degrees.
   ``Things for the short term are better here,'' park spokeswoman
Amy Vanderbilt said.
   ``We're more optimistic this morning than we have been for some
weeks,'' said Bill Baden, Forest Service director at the
Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, in an interview today on
CBS ``This Morning.'' The center coordinates forest fire fighting
nationwide.
   In the Sierra Nevada foothills of California, a wind-whipped
fire that began Sunday charred 12,000 acres of brush and timber,
destroyed 13 homes and seven to 17 other structures, and forced
residents of Lake Wildwood, Calif., a town of 4,500, to evacuate
today for a second time.
   About 1,200 firefighters fought the blaze today in the historic
Gold Rush country, said California Department of Forestry spokesman
Charlie Jakobs. At one point, flames engulfed a bulldozer, forcing
its operator to wrap himself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge
under his vehicle. He suffered minor burns.
   Light snow and low temperatures also helped firefighters in
Idaho, and rain and cooler weather slowed fires in Colorado.
   In northwest Oregon, officials closed millions of acres of
state-protected forests in an effort to curb the number of fires
caused by human carelessness.
   In Montana, crews took advantage of the cool weather to carve
lines around a forest fire north of Yellowstone and another that
has scorched more than 30,000 acres in and around Glacier National
Park near the Canadian border.
   At Glacier, two firefighters were injured when a tree fell
across the back of an open truck carrying crews to a 30,400-acre
fire, officials said.
   At Yellowstone, the light snow had firefighters shivering around
propane heaters Sunday night. Fire managers joked thatfears before
the weekend of another ``Black Saturday'' _ when fires on Saturday,
Aug. 20, sent blazes roaring across 150,000 acres _ melted when
``White Sunday'' arrived.
   Firefighters were pulled off the lines Sunday when the chill set
in.
   ``Our hoses were freezing up as fast as we put them out,'' said
Wayne Jones, a fire crew chief from Bushnell, Fla.
   Today's forecast was almost as good as Sunday's weather: a
chance of rain or snow, temperatures no higher than the 50s and
light winds.
   But by Tuesday, a drying trend is expected, with temperatures
climbing back into the 60s and 70s.
   ``In five or six days we could be back in a more severe weather
situation,'' Baden said.
   Firefighters took advantage of Sunday's good weather to shore up
their defenses against the wildfires, which have blackened about
900,000 of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres since June in what
firefighters call the worst fire season in the West in 30 years.
   The weather allowed park officials to reopen the west entrance
and the road from there to Old Faithful and Madison Junction north
of the famed geyser. The rest of the park remained closed to
visitors.
   Residents of park headquarters at Mammoth were allowed to return
home, but were told to be ready for another evacuation if flames
from a 263,400-acre fire threatens the area again.
   A 328,100-acre fire in the park's northeast quadrant expanded
significantly, combining with an 87,500-acre fire. But weather
conditions helped firefighting crews, enabling them to attack the
blaze directly.
   Lower temperatures raise humidity, and the moisture is soaked up
by tinder-dry trees, said Joe Halliday, chief naturalist for
Yellowstone's west district.
   The wood will ``be less likely to burn, although the fire
shouldn't have much trouble,'' Halliday said.
   ``Basically with this cold front that's moved in, it's going to
put us kind of in a holding pattern,'' said park spokeswoman Marty
Tobias.
   Cabinet officials, who toured Yellowstone National Park over the
weekend on President Reagan's orders, said the fires must be
extinguished, and said the policy of letting naturally ignited
wildfires in national parks and wilderness areas burn unless they
threaten property or people hasn't worked.
   ``The most important thing is to concentrate our efforts on
getting these fires under control and then out,'' Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel said Sunday at the Boise Interagency Fire
Center in Idaho, which coordinates Western firefighting efforts.
   ``The old policy has to be reviewed and altered,'' Hodel said.
``Nobody who has seen it operate this year could say it was a
success.''
   Hodel was accompanied by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and
Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV.
   Taft said two Marine battalions _ 1,200 men _ from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., and two additional Army battalions would be sent
to help fight fires. About 2,300 Army soldiers from Fort Lewis,
Wash., have already been dispatched.

<DATELINE>BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II preached peace and
reconciliation Monday during an open-air Mass in Matabeleland, a
province where tribal warfare ended only four months ago.
   ``No more training for war,'' the 68-year-old pontiff told
50,000 people at Ascot horse track in Bulawayo, the provincial
capital.
   ``Hammer swords into plowshares, spears into sickles and nation
will not lift sword against nation,'' he said.
   John Paul, who is on the first leg of a five-nation, 10-day
pilgrimage to southern Africa, flew to Bulawayo from Harare.
   He was welcomed at the track by bishops in cassocks and African
drummers, dancers and singers dressed in animal skins. The pope was
met at Bulawayo's heavily guarded airport by Joshua Nkomo, former
rival of President Robert Mugabe and now a senior minister in the
socialist government.
   In December, Nkomo and Mugabe signed an accord that merged their
feuding political parties. As a result, nearly eight years of
fighting between armed dissidents loyal to Nkomo and government
troops in Matabeleland ended in May.
   John Paul _ speaking in English, Latin and the two main African
languages of the Shona and Ndebele tribes _ lamented that the
minority Ndebele people of Matabeleland did not find peace after
independence from Britain April 18, 1980.
   But he prayed that their newfound peace and reconciliation would
hold.
   ``It is only eight years since your struggle for national
independence was brought to an end,'' the pontiff said from a
red-carpeted rostrum festooned with lilies. ``Even after that, many
people in Matabeleland did not find true peace ... the civilian
population continued to suffer from guerrilla warfare and other
forms of violence.''
   Before the Mass, John Paul was introduced by Swiss-born
Matabeleland Bishop Henry Karlen who in 1984 accused troops of
committing atrocities against the Ndebele, traditional foes of
Mugabe's dominant Shona tribe. Mugabe denounced Karlen at the time
for fabricating the charge and siding with terrorists.
   Among hundreds of civilians slain in the conflict were 10
Catholic missionaries, one of whom was killed on April 19 just
hours after Mugabe announced a general amnesty for rebels as part
of the accord.
   ``The people of Matabeleland have suffered much during the
liberation war,'' Karlen said, referring to the seven-year
guerrilla war led by separate armies under Nkomo and Mugabe against
white minority rule. Matabeleland continued to suffer after
independence through drought and violence, he added.
   ``The blood of 10 missionary martyrs of the diocese of Bulawayo
has flowed into the soil,'' Karlen said. ``May this blood bear
abundant fruit.''
   The pope's visit to Matabeleland came four months after 113
dissidents left their bush hideouts under the amnesty, and there
have been no reports of rebel-related violence since then.
   Under the accord, Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union, made
up of the Ndebele tribe, and Mugabe's governing Zimbabwe African
National Union, backed by the Shona people, will formally merge
under one banner as a prelude to establishing a one-party state in
Zimbabwe.
   John Paul will leave Harare on Tuesday for neighboring Botswana,
the next stop on his pilgrimage through black-ruled states
neighboring racially troubled South Africa. Before returning to the
Vatican, the pope will also visit Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique
before returning to the Vatican.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mph
winds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today after
skirting Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties. Telephone
communications were affected.
   ``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``We've
already had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip.
   ``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that
island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful
hurricane,'' Sheets said.
   Forecasters say Gilbert was expected to lash Jamaica throughout
the day and was on track to later strike the Cayman Islands, a
small British dependency northwest of Jamaica.
   Meanwhile, Havana Radio reported today that 25,000 people were
evacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba's southeastern coast as
strong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island.
   All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International
Airport, while flights from Grand Cayman, the main island of the
three-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers.
   ``People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on
Grand Cayman) like chickens with their heads cut off,'' said one
vacationer who was returning home to California through Miami.
   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands, Cuba and
Haiti. Warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic.
   ``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to
monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service
said, adding, ``Little change in strength is expected for the next
several hours as the hurricane moves westward over Jamaica.''
   The Associated Press' Caribbean headquarters in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, was unable to get phone calls through to Kingston, where high
winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital
overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering
streets with branches.
   Most Jamaicans stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation
for the hurricane. Some companies broadcast appeals for technicians
and electricians to report to work.
   The weather bureau predicted Gilbert's center, 140 miles
southeast of Kingston before dawn, would pass south of Kingston and
hit the southern parish of Clarendon.
   Flash flood warnings were issued for the parishes of Portland on
the northeast and St. Mary on the north. The north coast tourist
region from Montego Bay on the west and Ocho Rios on the east, far
from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains, was
expected only to receive heavy rain.
   Officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the
south coast to seek higher ground.
   ``It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the
Caribbean for a long time,'' said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the
National Hurricane Center.
   Forecasters at the center said the eye of Gilbert was 140 miles
southeast of Kingston at dawn today. Maximum sustained winds were
near 110 mph, with tropical-storm force winds extending up to 250
miles to the north and 100 miles to the south.
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica alerted all government
agencies, saying Sunday night: ``Hurricane Gilbert appears to be a
real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and
hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness
in order to minimize the danger.''
   Forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it
passed over the ocean after it dumped 5 to 10 inches of rain on the
Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of Hispaniola.
   ``We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be
a major threat to the United States,'' said Martin Nelson, another
meteorologist at the center. ``It's moving at about 17 mph to the
west and normally hurricanes take a northward turn after they pass
central Cuba.''
   Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency said a state of alert
was declared at midday in the Cuban provinces of Guantanamo,
Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Granma.
   In the report from Havana received in Mexico City, Prensa Latina
said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on
national radio and television recommending emergency measures and
providing information on the storm.
   Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused
flooding in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night as the
hurricane's center passed just south of the Barahona peninsula,
then less than 100 miles from neighboring Haiti.
   The storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal areas
of southwestern Puerto Rico after reaching hurricane strength off
the island's southeast Saturday night.
   Flights were canceled Sunday in the Dominican Republic, where
civil defense director Eugenio Cabral reported some flooding in
parts of the capital of Santo Domingo and power outages there and
in other southern areas.

<TEXT>
   The president of Bangladesh appealed
Monday for more foreign aid to feed more than 40 million people
left homeless by the flood, and doctors tried to halt an epidemic
of diarrhea.
   More than 250,000 people were suffering from diarrhea, the
health center said, with nearly 36,000 new cases reported in the
last 24 hours. Many got the disease by drinking water contaminated
by raw sewage and flood waters.
   A senior doctor who declined to be identified said about 5
percent of the diarrhea patients have contracted cholera.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad said the $280 million in aid
so far promised to his country was not enough even to rebuild roads
washed away by flood waters that cover three-fourths of the country.
   He said it was too early to estimate the total amount of funds
needed.
   ``For centuries the people of Bangladesh have lived with floods,
but never before have the rivers unleashed such fury on her
people,'' the 59-year-old former army general told a news
conference.
   The government puts the official death toll at 881 from the
floods, which started June 13 and reached new heights in late
August. The health control center said 138 deaths were from
diarrhea, while the others were caused by drownings, houses
collapsing and snake bites.
   Daily tallies in Dhaka newspapers, however, put the death toll
at 1,647, without giving a breakdown by category.
   A substantial amount of emergency flood relief arrived Monday in
a giant U.S. military cargo plane.
   The C-5a Galaxy contained water purification units, water
storage tanks and 10,000 five-gallon water containers.
   The plane also brought the deputy U.S. aid director, Jay F.
Morris, and doctors from the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, water purification specialists, and Defense Department
transport and logistics specialists.
   The International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, funded
primarily by foreign aid, said it had admitted 550 patients with
diarrhea in the past 24 hours, compared with an average of 155
patients a day last month.
   The senior doctor who reported the cholera problem said it was
typical that 5 percent of the diarrhea cases would turn out to be
cholera.
   Dhaka newspapers also have reported isolated cholera cases from
people drinking flood-polluted water.
   Ershad, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and later
was elected to the presidency in what his opponents called a rigged
vote, said there are only 8,000 doctors in Bangladesh, a nation of
110 million people. He said 30 million to 40 million people were
marooned by the flood or in need of help.
   He also said the flood had destroyed or damaged 8 million
houses. Since the average size of a family in Banglasesh is six
people, that would appear to mean that 48 million are homeless, up
from the 25 million reported previously.
   
   The flood control center said major rivers were receding Monday
in the north and west but rising slightly in the south as flood
waters approached the Bay of Bengal.
   The Ganges River, which enters Bangladesh from India, fell by
three-fourths of an inch at the western monitoring station of
Gualnanda but remained 19 inches above flood level. At the southern
monitoring station of Bhagakul, the Ganges rose one-third of an
inch to about 30 inches above flood stage.
   Ershad said 53 of the country's 64 districts have been affected
by the flood.
   The United States pledged about $154 million worth of aid to
Bangladesh for flood relief, but a large portion of this was
already in the pipeline to Bangladesh and is being released early.
   For example, the allocation of aid included $60 million in food
grains already planned for release in the coming 12 months.
   Embassy officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were unable to say how much of the $154 million of aid was actually
new. Before the flood, the United States had allotted about $131
million worth of aid to Bangladesh, which is one of the world's
largest aid recipients.
   Aid promised to Bangladesh by foreign donors before the flood
stood at $2 billion for the current year.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis declared today that ``George Bush has
failed'' in three critical foreign policy tests, while Republican
Bush took a new shot at Dukakis on military policy.
   Bush also defended Frederic V. Malek, his adviser who abruptly
left a top Republican Party post Sunday after a news story saying
he counted the number of Jews in a federal agency for
then-President Nixon in 1971.
   Dukakis, in Philadelphia, said the three key points of his
national security policy would be a solid domestic economy making
the United States strong in international trade, unwavering
opposition to terrorism and a stepped-up effort to halt
international drug trafficking.
   ``In each of these three areas, George Bush has failed,''
Dukakis told a crowd of about 250 people in a union hall. ``I want
to beat our foreign competitors; he's willing to settle for second
best. I want to crack down on terrorism; he knuckled under to the
ayatollah. I want a real war on drugs; his answer to drug kingpins
like Noriega is J. Danforth Quayle.''
   General Manuel Antonio Noriega is the Panamanian leader charged
in U.S. federal court with drug violations. Quayle is Bush's vice
presidential running mate.
   Bush, meanwhile, said in Washington that Dukakis would lean on
international organizations too much rather than take action as the
Reagan administration did in Grenada, in attacking Libya and in
escorting ships through the Persian Gulf.
   ``We cannot abdicate our responsibility for leadership,'' Bush
said in Washington before leaving on a campaign trip to New Jersey,
the Midwest and California.
   At a street rally in the heavily Cuban neighborhood of Union
City, N.J., where he was preceded by salsa music and chants of
``Viva Bush,'' the vice president declared that ``America has
economic power and I'm not going to let them take it away from
you.''
   Bush was introduced by Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who struck an
emotional nerve among the Cuban exiles when he said that ``every
time a dictatorship has threatened democracy, George bush has been
there.''
   Bush also named a 13-member national security panel, including
former secretaries of state Henry A. Kissinger and Alexander Haig
as well as Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was former President Carter's
national security adviser.
   Brzezinski said he was proud to have served Carter, a Democrat,
but of the two current presidential candidates Republican Bush ``is
the one who can best fashion an effective bipartisan foreign
policy.''
   Bush was asked by reporters about Malek, who resigned as deputy
chairman of the Republican National Committee after a report Sunday
in The Washington Post that he compiled figures on the number of
Jews in high-ranking positions in the Bureau of Labor Statistics
during the Nixon administration.
   ``I know this man and I know him to be without one ounce of
bigotry or prejudice in his makeup,'' Bush said.
   Notes that are part of the presidential archives refer to
Nixon's search for a ``Jewish cabal'' that he thought was using
unemployment data to put him in an unfavorable light. Malek
acknowledged compiling the figures, but said he thought Nixon's
notions were ``nonsense,'' and that he had nothing to do with
subsequent demotion of two Jewish officials in the bureau.
   The report was the second in a week suggesting that people
connected with the Bush campaign engaged in activities that were
either overtly anti-Semitic or could be construed that way.
   Malek, who was Nixon's personnel chief at the time, issued a
statement with the announcement of his resignation Sunday saying he
didn't want publicity about his actions for Nixon to jeopardize the
Bush campaign.
   The resignation deprives Bush, at least temporarily, of direct
control over the national party during the fall campaign.
   Malek's resignation followed the departure last week of Jerome
Brentar as co-chairman of Bush's campaign organization for ethnic
groups. Brentar, a Cleveland travel agent, had been an active
defender of Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who was extradited and
convicted in Israel of being a Nazi war criminal.
   Last week, the Washington Jewish Week newspaper reported that
Brentar was active in groups that denied the existence of the
Holocaust and that he had made anti-Semitic statements. The report
named several members of Bush's ethnic coalition who had ties to
fascistic and anti-Semitic groups.
   ``What at first seemed to be a few unsettling errors in judgment
in the Bush campaign now seems to be growing into a pattern of
astonishing insensitivity that is totally inappropriate for an
American presidential campaign,'' Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,
said Sunday in a statement.
   Dukakis, who has taken a more aggressive stance in recent days,
spoke Sunday with congressional leaders in Boston about his image
on national security and foreign policy issues and promised to
``restate my positions forcefully'' this week.
   Among the nearly dozen members of Congress who attended the
meeting were Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee; Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, Nunn's counterpart
in the House, and former presidential candidate Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee.
   Dukakis acknowledged after the meeting that he had some
differences with leading defense spokesmen of his party, most of
whom are more hard-line, but promised a consensus-oriented approach
to setting Pentagon priorities.
   ``What you see here is an example of the way we're going to make
national security policy beginning in January 1989,'' Dukakis said.
``With a president and a Congress that work together.''
   Dukakis has undergone repeated criticism from the Bush campaign,
which claims he seeks ``unilateral disarmament.'' And last week
Dukakis appeared to change his position on Star Wars, which he
previously described as a fantasy, by saying he would support
research on the space-based defense program.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has completed its first multi-candidate
elections of provincial leaders, the weekly Beijing Review said
Monday.
   The authoritative weekly said the elections, which wound up in
August, ``marked a new step forward for democracy'' in China, where
formerly there was only one candidate for each seat chosen by the
Communist Party.
   It said that of China's 29 provinces and autonomous regions, the
governors of eight and the chairmen of 11 provincial people's
congresses were chosen in multi-candidate votes. Deputy governors
and vice-chairmen in 28 regions faced competition, it said.
   Under a 1986 law, there should be more than one candidate for
provincial-level offices and each candidate must be nominated by at
least 10 deputies to the provincial congress, or legislature.
   Final voting is done by the deputies. Ordinary citizens can vote
directly only for officials at the township and county level.
   The weekly said the number of candidates nominated to the
provincial posts was 24 percent greater than the vacant positions.
   ``With the break from the outmoded convention that a candidate,
once nominated, would definitely be elected, the notion that
officials can only get promotions but never demotions was pushed
aside,'' it said.
   The report also said the elections, held ever five years,
increased from 18 to 26 percent those governors and deputy
governors under the age of 50. College graduates increased from 69
percent to 74 percent. In people's congresses, chairmen and
vice-chairmen under 60 years rose from 8 percent to 30 percent.

   U.S. military experts flew to Vietnam
on Monday to discuss possible joint searches for remains of
American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the U.S. Embassy
said.
   The five-man team was to have left Friday on an Air Vietnam jet,
but that plane crashed while attempting to land at Bangkok airport,
killing 76 people.
   An embassy release said the group flew to the Vietnamese capital
of Hanoi by special embassy aircraft. It is headed by Lt. Col. Joe
Harvey, commander of the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center in
Hawaii.
   The talks by technical specialists would be the seventh since
the United States and Vietnam agreed in August 1987 to speed up
cooperation on the issue.
   Vietnam later postponed cooperation on joint searches, including
excavation of warplane crash sites, but recently changed its mind.
There has been only one previous joint excavation, in late 1985.

   The world's only surviving girl
sextuplets started school on Monday and were paired off into three
different classrooms.
   Hannah, Jenny, Kate, Ruth, Lucy and Sarah Walton, who celebrate
their fifth birthday on Nov. 18, were led by their parents into St.
George's Primary School in Wallasey near Liverpool, northwest
England.
   The school, with 712 students, is the largest in the area and
was chosen because it allowed the girls to be split up, their
parents said.
   ``I think they will really enjoy it,'' said their father, Graham
Walton, ``They mix very well with other children and they are
excited about it.''
   Headmaster Bruce Harry said the girls were divided into three
groups because ``if they had all gone into one ... class the
teacher would have found difficulty balancing the time she gave
them and the other children.''
   The girls resemble one another but are not identical.

plan to vote in the November presidential election, according to a
statewide poll published Monday.
   Dukakis edged Bush 48 percent to 41 percent in the Milwaukee

   Two men, one of them naked, died in separate
incidents after being shot with stun guns during struggles with
police, authorities said Monday.
   Autopsies were scheduled, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy
Gabe Ramirez said.
   An unidentified man about 38 years old was shot with a Taser
dart after a struggle with Bell-Cudahy police Sunday, Ramirez said.
   The unidentified man, believed to be under the influence of
drugs, became violent and began fighting with officers.
   ``During the altercation, a Taser was used to subdue him,''
Ramirez said. The man was pronounced dead at St. Francis Medical
Center in Lynwood.
   In the other incident, Charles Eugene Miles, 37, was found
standing nude Sunday at an intersection in Paramount, 12 miles
south of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``When the sheriff's department stopped to investigate, he
became combative and a violent struggle began,'' Ramirez said.
   A Taser was unsuccessful in controlling Miles, who also was
believed to be under the influence of drugs, officials said.
   ``When it failed to bring him under control, he was finally
physically subdued,'' Ramirez said.
   Miles, of Bellflower, was taken to the jail ward of Los Angeles
County-USC Medical Center, where he died.
   Information on how many times each victim was shot with the
Tasers and the identities of the officers involved was not released.
   Tasers are described by police as non-lethal guns that fire
darts which deliver a brief, 50,000 volt, low-amperage charge that
temporarily paralyzes the nervous system.

   Former Mayor Mike Roark, who resigned
last year after pleading guilty to federal drug possession charges,
will become a commentator for West Virginia Public Radio, officials
said Monday.
   Roark, a Republican, will go on the air once or twice a month to
provide a conservative viewpoint on current events, said public
radio spokeswoman Beth Vorhees. His first segment will run in the
next few weeks, she said.
   Commentators decide for themselves what they will discuss and
receive $5 each time they go on the air, Vorhees said Monday. West
Virginia Public Radio has about 12 commentators, she said.
   ``This is not a full-time, hired position,'' Vorhees said.
``He's doing us a favor. We needed a conservative commentator, so
we asked him.''
   Roark pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor charges of cocaine
possession and was sentenced to 179 days in prison on Jan. 14. He
resigned as mayor as part of his plea agreement.
   He was released July 20 after serving 5{ months of his term. A
state Bar subcommittee is deliberating whether to recommend that
Roark's law license be revoked.

   A former janitor has fought for nearly nine
years since his acquittal on rape charges to get his old job back
at the University of Pittsburgh and to get a speedy resolution of
his case in state courts.
   ``The guy's going to be dead and buried by the time this is
resolved,'' attorney Robert Kane said.
   Arthur Robinson, 62, was fired from his janitor's job on Aug.
10, 1979, after a woman charged that he raped her two months
earlier.
   Robinson, who had no criminal record, was acquitted in December
1979, but he was not given his job back even though he had worked
at the university for 14 years.
   He sued, charging his firing was unjustified. He also filed a
complaint with the city Human Relations Commission charging the
university with race discrimination. Robinson is black.
   A Common Pleas Court jury in 1982 ordered Robinson's
reinstatement and awarded him nearly $125,000. After the university
appealed, Robinson settled the case in 1985 for $15,000 and
attorney's fees.
   Meanwhile, the city Human Relations Commission ordered
Robinson's reinstatement with back pay in March 1984.
   The university appealed that decision, too, but Common Pleas
Court officials apparently lost Robinson's file, delaying a trial
until December 1987, when Judge Robert A. Doyle affirmed the
commission's ruling.
   The university appealed again, to Commonwealth Court, on Jan. 8.
Commonwealth Court officials failed to get Doyle to forward
Robinson's files until last Friday, when a judge from that court
ordered Doyle to send the information.
   Robert Prorok, attorney for the university, said the case has
been appealed because there was no racial discrimination against
Robinson.
   ``The university's basis for discharging (Robinson) was an
investigation that, in their judgment, concluded that he committed
the rape. We sincerely believe that race had absolutely nothing to
do with his dismissal,'' he said.
   ``The fact that someone is acquitted in a criminal case doesn't
necessarily mean he didn't commit the crime,'' Prorok said.
   Robinson's wife, Odessa, said her husband hasn't worked since
1979. He said the family has lived on Social Security, welfare, a
small pension and a newspaper route.
   ``I believe God in his own time will clear this up,'' she said.
``But it looks as if somebody somewhere came between us and the
Lord.''

<TEXT>
   Rumors of devil worship and child abduction
have spread like wildfire across a large section of eastern
Kentucky, stumping police who have fielded thousands of telephone
calls from terrified residents.
   ``This is the first time to my knowledge that a rumor of this
nature has gotten to this proportion,'' said Elijah Hollon, a
Laurel County sheriff's deputy. ``This one seems like it's carrying
on much more than anything I've ever seen before.''
   ``It got wild here,'' Jackson Mayor Frank Noble said. ``You
could have brought a bunch of guns in here and made a fortune.'' He
said he understood that one department store had sold out of guns.
   A survey of sheriff's offices, police departments and Kentucky
State Police posts found satanic rumors have spread into at least
25 eastern Kentucky counties since late July.
   In most cases, the rumors hold that Satan worshipers are looking
for blond, blue-eyed children to kill in a sacrifice to the devil.
Some versions say the satanic followers must round up several
children to sacrifice before Halloween.
   All the law enforcement officials surveyed last week said they
believed the stories were false. Most agencies reported
investigating and finding no supporting evidence.
   Hollon and other officers said they believed the stories started
in Breathitt County, where a grave robbery was discovered July 18.
Two juveniles and four adults were charged in connection with the
grave desecration.
   Noble, who also is Jackson's police chief, said officers found a
pentacle or five-pointed star on the floor of a mobile home the
defendants are alleged to have used for satanic ceremonies. The
words ``Satan Rules'' were inscribed outside a circle around the
star symbol, he said.
   At each point of the star, officers discovered a drop of what
was believed to be blood, Noble said. Videotapes and books on the
occult were confiscated from the trailer on Aug. 15, he said.
   Many residents wrongly believed that police were withholding
information about the grave robbery and possible satanic
connections, Noble said.
   ``At first we couldn't even calm people down,'' he said. ``Until
we got the trailer, we couldn't come right out and say they were
devil worshiping.''

   Actress Loni Anderson says letting her husband,
Burt Reynolds, control their marriage is fine with her.
   ``I don't want to be No. 1 in this marriage,'' she said in an
interview in the October issue of McCall's magazine.
   ``For most of my career I was a driven woman, then three years
ago my mother died of cancer at a comparatively young age and I sat
down to do some serious thinking,'' she said.
   ``Did I want to end up an old lady living alone and surrounded
by statues, scrapbooks and memories? Or is it more important to
have some fine man with whom to share a life, as mother did? I
opted for the latter.''
   Anderson, who recently finished two television movies, said she
and Reynolds plan to raise their recently adopted son in Jupiter,
Fla., where Reynolds runs a dinner theater.
   ``I'll get as many parts as I can that can be filmed in Florida,
maybe even another sitcom, but Burt's work comes first,'' Anderson
said.

   Sigourney Weaver says working closely with
animals in her portrayal of the gorilla observer Dian Fossey has
profoundly affected her.
   ``Dian treated animals with such respect, as equals. That's
something we're not brought up to do,'' Weaver, who battled space
creatures in the ``Alien'' movies, tells Glamour magazine in its
October issue.
   Fossey, who studied rare mountain gorillas in the African nation
of Rwanda and who took extreme and violent actions against
poachers, was killed by an unknown assailant in 1985.
   Weaver says she is ``sort of sick of all this `woman's descent
into madness' crap. I think that what Dian accomplished was great,
and what she went through made her obsessiveness quite
understandable.''
   ``I think I fell in love with the gorillas just the way she did,
and suddenly everything she did made sense to me.''
   The film, ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' was shot on location in
Rwanda.

   Maria Shriver, a member of the Kennedy family, a
television anchorwoman and the wife of a movie star, says her life
is ``boringly normal.''
   Ms. Shriver insists in an interview with McCall's magazine that
her goals are pretty much the same as everybody else's: a
satisfying career, a happy home life, ``some inner peace.''
   ``I just want to survive and hang in there and do good work,''
said Ms. Shriver, a niece of President John F. Kennedy and the
daughter of Eunice Kennedy and Sargent Shriver. Ms. Shriver works
for NBC News in New York and shares a home with actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger in Los Angeles.
   In her current job, she said, she's ``the happiest I've ever
been'' professionally. Her low point was when CBS canceled its
``Morning News,'' which she co-anchored.
   ``I remember being brought up to believe that you always have to
win, to be No. 1,'' she said. ``When people are thinking about that
all the time and they don't succeed, it can be overwhelming and
defeating.''

   Dan Aykroyd is bringing back Elwood Blues,
for only the second time since the death of John Belushi, who
played the other Blues Brother.
   Elwood Blues will perform as the Elwood Blues Review, with
veteran bluesmen Sam Moore and Booker T. Jones during NBC's
``Coca-Cola presents: Live, The Hard Rock,'' to be broadcast
Tuesday to raise money for the homeless.
   ``It will just be a sample of what the Elwood Blues Review could
give the world if we could get some bookings,'' said Aykroyd, who
with Belushi created Jake and Elwood Blues on ``NBC's Saturday
Night Live.''
   Since Belushi's death, Aykroyd has performed as Elwood only at
the Atlantic Records anniversary concert earlier this year.
   Tuesday night's show also features musicians Paul Simon and John
Cougar-Mellencamp, comedians John Candy and Jon Lovitz and
``Saturday Night'' alumni Laraine Newman and producer Lorne
Michaels.
   ``It's great that we have the old team back together again,''
Aykroyd said.
   ``It's the best!'' Newman said. ``It feels comfortable. It feels
nice.''

<TEXT>
   A long-lost sketch in pen and ink
owned by George Washington has been placed in the first president's
Mount Vernon estate after a man found it among the belongings of an
elderly neighbor.
   Chester Norback, 85, a former appliance salesman, said in 1975
he noticed an old sketch in a neighbor's home in Killingworth,
which is 20 miles east of New Haven. The sketch, about 20 by 16
inches, is of a huge stone prison being demolished.
   The neighbor, Allen Carswell, acquired the sketch about 40 years
earlier from a Brooklyn, N.Y., warehouse, Norwell said.
   Norback said Carswell's wife, Dorothy, showed him a 1958 New
York Times clipping that included a photograph of the sketch. The
caption said the sketch was entitled, ``Destruction of the
Bastille,'' and explained that it was a gift from Lafayette to
Washington.
   The sketch's whereabouts had been unknown since its sale at
auction in 1891, the story said.
   Norback said that in 1984, when Dorothy Carswell had been a
widow for five years, she gave Norback power of attorney, handed
him the key to her home and asked him to help her into a nursing
home.
   Norback found the sketch and hid it under his bed.
   A month later, Mrs. Carswell died. ``For a period of time there
wasn't a person in the world _ but myself _ who knew about that
picture,'' Norback said.
   Norback sent a note to Mount Vernon, saying in part, ``If you
are still searching for this picture, ... I think I can help you.''
   Christine Meadows, Mount Vernon's curator, called Norback almost
immediately.
   Mrs. Carswell bequeathed her $400,000 estate to the Shriners
Hospitals for Crippled Children and to the Masonic Charity
Foundation of Connecticut.
   The charities at first expected to keep the sketch, appraised at
$20,000. But a letter Norback sent each, together with Mount
Vernon's interest and the necessary legal releases, moved both
organizations to loan the treasure to the Virginia estate.
   ``That painting belonged to Mount Vernon and the country,''
Norback said.

   A man who worked five years to surround his home
with flowers uprooted his plantings and moved after burglars stole
everything but his bed frame and clothes.
   Cleveland Turner's yard, located in a poor section of the city,
had been full of flowers and adornments such as plastic swams and a
wood cutout of Mickey Mouse.
   But Turner, frustrated over two recent burglaries, pulled out
the bright surroundings last week and moved from the three-room
house to another rental home about two miles away.
   ``They (burglars) usually break in once a year, but they hit me
two times last week and stole everything but my bedstead and
clothes,'' said Turner, 53, who cleans residential windows and does
other odd jobs for a living.
   ``I just couldn't cut it anymore. I cried for two nights
straight to keep from moving. But I just couldn't stay there
anymore.''
   Eddie Minor Jr., 41, a former neighbor, was saddened to see
Turner leave.
   ``He had it looking nice, too _ you couldn't find nothing like
that anywhere,'' Minor said. ``Everybody loved it.''

   Auctioneer Merle Scherman decided not
to sell off one item he discovered at a farm near this northwestern
Minnesota town: a World War II bomb used as a farmhouse doorstop.
   Scherman, an auctioneer, came across the 2-foot-long brass
projectile as he was conducting inventory for an estate auction at
the farm. He said it had been used as a doorstop for a number of
years.
   Concerned that the 35-pound shell could pose a danger to people
attending the auction, Scherman contacted the Minnesota National
Guard Armory.
   The armory contacted the Mahnomen County Sheriff's Department to
have officers pick up the projectile. Sheriff Dennis Spickard
picked up the shell Thursday and brought it to his office.
   He contacted the National Guard camp at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin,
which has facilities for exploding a shell. He said he wasn't
concerned about having the device in his office.
   ``The way I look at it, it's been sitting around being used as a
doorstop for maybe 40 years or more and nothing has happened yet,''
he said.
   Personnel from Fort McCoy picked up the device and brought it to
the southern Wisconsin fort.
   Mary Binder, public affairs officer at Fort McCoy, said Monday
it was destroyed at the fort. She said it was a World War II Navy
anti-aircraft projectile.
   Asked if the device could have exploded during the years it
served as a doorstop, she said, ``It was designed to be shot from
aircraft and several things had to be done to it before it would go
off.''
   But she noted the device still had explosives in it and ``things
have been known to go off.''

   Patrick Korten, the Justice Department's chief
spokesman and staunch defender of former Attorney General Edwin
Meese III throughout a 14-month criminal investigation, said today
that he is resigning.
   Korten will be replaced effective next week by Loye Miller, who
is press secretary and director of public affairs for the
Department of Education. Korten plans to spend several months at
the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank which
Meese joined last month. While there, Korton plans to carry out
some writing projects at the foundation while hoping to return
eventually to broadcasting.
   In an interview Korton said that he will remain at the
department for three or four weeks to assist in the transition to a
new director of public affairs. Korten, who has been under fire in
recent days for a trip he took to Japan at public expense, said he
told Attorney General Richard Thornburgh in July that he planned to
leave the department.
   Miller, a former political writer for Knight-Ridder and Newhouse
Newspapers, has known Attorney General Richard Thornburgh for a
number of years. Miller, 58, has been with the department of
education since June 1985. His boss, Education Secretary William
Bennett, is leaving the department next week.
   Korten, 40, who spent 11 years in radio and television news
before joining the Reagan administration, came to the Justice
Department in July 1985 as the deputy director of the office of
public affairs. In May, he became director after Meese fired chief
spokesman Terry Eastland.

   Leaders of a black boycott of the
district's 17 public schools urged teachers in the school system to
call in sick Monday, but a school official said teacher attendance
was normal.
   The boycott was called to pressure officials to oust school
superintendent Nolan Vickers and his assistant, Janet Sweatt, both
of whom are white. Protesters say the two are not sensitive to the
needs of the mostly black school district.
   ``From 1869 they've had a white (superintendent),'' said protest
leader Willie Long, education chairman of the group, Save Our
Children. ``We ask for one black person, and we're racist.''
   Vickers and Sweatt have declined to comment on the boycott.
   ``From what I gathered, it is a normal day for absences on the
part of teachers,'' Assistant Superintendent Arthur Peyton said
Monday.
   Some parents also have been holding their children out of class
in protest. For two days last week, almost one-third of the
district's students were absent from classes.
   Peyton said 5,564 students were in attendance Monday.
   Before the boycott began, attendance was 8,834 in the district's
17 public school. Thursday, 5,879 students attended, and 6,082
attended Friday.
   About 200 people marched Saturday through the downtown area in
support of the boycott. Police escorted marchers for about a mile
through the downtown as they sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and carried
banners calling for the superintendent's ouster.

   A small earthquake centered offshore
near metropolitan Los Angeles awakened residents early Monday, but
there were no reports of damage or injury, authorities said.
   Police were flooded with calls after the shaker, which struck at
6:24 a.m. and registered 3.8 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
according to preliminary readings. The U.S. Geological Survey in
Golden, Colo., recorded the quake at 4 on the Richter scale.
   The quake was centered four miles southwest of the coastal city
of El Segundo, 19 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles, said
Steve Bryant, seismic analyst at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   No damage was reported to county sheriff's stations or police or
fire departments in El Segundo, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach,
Redondo Beach and on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. A lifeguard on
Santa Catalina Island said he did not feel the temblor in Avalon.
   ``We've had lots of calls from people asking what that was,''
said Torrance police officer Jeannie Metcalf. ``I think it woke up
quite a few people.''
   Sgt. James Hirt of the Santa Monica Police Department said they
had also gotten dozens of calls, but he hadn't felt the temblor.
   ``It's not earthshaking, unless it's really earth shaking,'' he
said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area.

   Processors handling the alligators killed
in Florida's first gator season in two decades say they are working
overtime to keep up with successful hunters.
   ``We've been working until 2 or 3 in the morning every night,''
said Kenneth Geiger, who runs one of 29 facilities in Florida that
skin and butcher alligators. ``They're stacking up like cordwood.''
   Less than halfway through the monthlong hunt, which began Sept.
1 and was authorized because of the proliferation of the
alligators, several hunters are near the quota of 15 each. The hunt
is monitored by the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission,
but the 238 licensed hunters are not required to file records until
two weeks after the hunt ends.
   ``We won't know anything about numbers until after the
harvest,'' said Scott Ball, public information specialist with the
commission. ``We kept a tally the first day, and we counted at
least 131 gators.''
   If each hunter bags the quota, 3,450 alligators will be killed.
The commission has estimated about 2,600 alligators would be killed.
   ``We've been going literally 24 hours a day,'' said G.O. Parrot,
a processor near Bushnell. ``We've probably done about 50 or 60
since the season started.''
   ``It takes us about an hour a foot and we've done 200 feet of
gator and boxed 750 pounds of meat,'' said Barry Holdridge, the
chief processor at Hooks Alligator Product in Davie. ``If every
hunter gets their quota, we will be up to our eyes in gator.''
   A licensed processor will sometimes buy the whole alligator for
$30 to $50 a foot. Other hunters pay a processing fee and get back
the meat and hide.

<HEAD>Jessica Lange Says America Facing Family Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Jessica Lange says the problems facing
Americans should not be blamed on men or women but on the fact that
the family unit has become ``disposable.''
   ``I think that it's not only what's wrong with men. It's what's
wrong with women, what's wrong with children. It think that's
what's wrong with civilization in America,'' Lange says in the
October issue of Vanity Fair. ``The family's become disposable.''
   ``You know, if you don't like your wife, you can get rid of her;
if you don't like your husband for a day, you can get rid of him.''
   The star of ``Frances,'' ``Tootsie'' and ``Sweet Dreams'' says
she fears the disintegration of the family is ``a signal of the
end, of this whole kind of apocalyptic feeling that is in the air
now.''
   Despite her feelings, Lange has resisted remarrying. She lives
with playwright Sam Shepard and they have two children. She has a
third child by dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov.
   Her marriage, to a Spanish photographer, ended before she became
an actress.
   ``I think marriage is about your commitment to the other
person,'' she says. ``It has absolutely nothing to do with some
government decree. The legality of it means absolutely nothing to
me whatsoever.
   ``That's not going to make people live their lives together and
be responsible to each other,'' she says.

<HEAD>Stock Analyst Showers Gifts On Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOLIVAR, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A San Francisco stock analyst who began
giving gifts to his Ozark hometown almost two years ago with the
donation of a $3 million trust has delivered another bonanza.
   David Delarue last week gave Bolivar $300,000 to put toward
development of a civic center and new city hall.
   Bolivar Mayor Joe Lemmon said the gift came so unexpectedly that
no plans were drawn up yet for the civic center. But he said
$104,000 was spent Thursday to buy property for the new center. The
rest of the money will be used to build the civic center after
matching funds are raised.
   ``A civic center has been discussed here for years, but we
haven't had the funds,'' Lemmon said.
   In December 1986, Delarue established a $3 million trust fund
that he said was a gesture of thanks to the community where he grew
up.
   The trust benefits the city, Polk County and various public
agencies. Recipients received an initial interest payment of
$150,000 this year and expect to receive annual payments of
$240,000 until 2100, when the principal will be given to the city.
   Delarue said he keeps track of what is going on in Bolivar
through old friends who still live in the town of about 6,000
people 30 miles north of Springfield.
   He said he learned about two weeks ago that a 2.2-acre plot of
land near the central square was available through an estate sale,
and immediately thought of buying it for the city.
   ``There was no planning,'' Delarue said Monday in a telephone
interview from his San Francisco home. ``It's probably the city's
last chance to find such a nice piece of property (close to
downtown.) I mainly thought they needed a community hall or
community center.''
   The mayor was delighted. ``We never know what to expect'' from
Delarue, he said. ``We love it.''

   A man was critically burned when he climbed a
utility pole to remove a dead snake he believed was interfering
with electricity in the neighborhood.
   Denny Lee Perry, 26, of Berwick, was airlifted from a ballfield
near his parents' home to West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh, where
he was in critical condition Monday with burns over 56 percent of
his body.
   The snake was killed Saturday at the home of Perry's parents,
Ken and Patsy Perry, by Perry and his brother, Louie, said Lynne
Shoup, 19, fiancee of Louie Perry. It then was tossed onto the
power lines.
   Fire Chief Jim Edwards said Perry later tried to remove the
snake because he thought it was affecting power.
   ``All the electricity was blinking on and off,'' Miss Shoup said.
   Perry climbed the utility pole, touched a 23,000-volt power line
and fell 23 feet to the ground, Edwards said.

<HEAD>Church Hit By Deadly 1963 Bombing Now Finds Membership Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attendance at the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church has declined dramatically in the 25 years since
dynamite killed four black girls, but the pastor says its
membership is worldwide in spirit.
   ``Sixteenth Street is not a local church _ Sept. 15, 1963, made
sure of that,'' said the Rev. James E. Young. ``It is in the truest
sense the people's church.''
   The church, which is marking the 25th anniversary of the bombing
this week, nearly filled its 1,500 seats regularly in the 1940s and
1950s and became a rallying point for civil rights demonstrators
who filled it in the 1960s.
   Now, it has about 100 members. The church has suffered common
urban church problems such as members moving away from downtown.
   At Sunday's service, which opened the week's anniversary
observance program, the balcony was empty, as were many pews on the
main floor, and visitors outnumbered members when asked to stand.
   ``That didn't look so good, as far as the church itself was
concerned,'' said James L. Lowe, a deacon and member of the church
for 60 years. Lowe, who plays the clarinet and saxophone, is the
lone member of the church orchestra, which once had 20 musicians.
   Lowe said the church's role during the civil rights movement,
while making it a landmark, did not please all the members.
   ``We suffered a great deal because we had so many threats coming
into the church,'' said Lowe.
   The church was formed in 1873 and the building, designed by a
black architect and built by a black contractor, was erected in
1906. The bombing heavily damaged the basement area where the girls
were killed but the damage was not as severe elsewhere in the
building. A white man, Robert Edward Chambliss, was convicted of
murder in the explosion.
   Young said the media coverage of the 25th anniversary may help
bring more people to the church.
   ``Our hope is that there will be some benefits to the whole
community, including members of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church,''
he said.
   ``We are hoping that we will get the attendance up,'' said
William M. Parker, chairman of the church's board of trustees and a
member since 1965. ``That would help us a lot.''

<TEXT>
   NBC has canceled its critically praised but
low-rated ``Main Street,'' an afternoon news program for children.
   ``I made the decision last Wednesday that there was just no way
that show could live. It was a decision widely expected. I met with
the staff on Friday afternoon,'' NBC News President Michael G.
Gartner said Monday.
   For Gartner, a newspaper editor and executive who took over as
head of the news division in July, it was a quick introduction to
the realities of television programming.
   ``Sure it's hard,'' he said. ``You'd much rather be meeting with
the staff and launching something rather than killing something.
But the show didn't have the support of advertisers, didn't have
the support of affiliates and didn't have support of the audience.
As I told somebody, one out of three would have been nice.''
   Gartner said he now has ``sort of finished the process'' of
layoffs that began after last year's efficiency appraisal. The
layoffs have involved approximately 400 news division employees.
   Gartner said the last round of layoffs, effective at year's end,
included a ``handful'' of permanent employees, along with 60-70
employees who had been hired on a temporary basis for election
coverage.
   NBC is closing its Houston bureau as of the end of the year,
dismissing six people there. A producer and office manager will
maintain an NBC office in Houston, but correspondent Dan Molina and
bureau chief Ray Cullen will be transferred to Los Angeles. NBC has
nine domestic bureaus, including Houston. It has offices in three
other cities.
   All three network news divisions have been laying off employees
for the past couple of years as new management has taken over and
reassessed costs.

<HEAD>Political Challengers Favor Free TV-Time Requirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A solid majority of political challengers but
less than one-third of incumbents say television and radio stations
should be required to give House and Senate candidates free air
time, says a report on the role of media in congressional campaigns.
   The report, by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics,
said a requirement that included more time for debates would make
an overall lid on campaign spending much more palatable, even to
incumbents.
   ``Beyond the 30-Second Spot'' was based on a survey of 141 House
and 40 Senate incumbents and challengers who ran in 1986. They were
asked how they used electronic media and how they might want to
change the laws affecting political broadcasting.
   Half of the 181 candidates surveyed spent more money on
commercial television than on direct mail, radio or newspaper ads;
only 12.7 percent of the candidates tried to buy air time longer
than 30 or 60 seconds.
   Among incumbents, 29.5 percent favored requiring broadcasters to
provide free media time, while 60.9 percent of challengers
supported the idea. Some 40 percent of the incumbents and 75
percent of the challengers said any free media arrangement should
include mandated debate time for congressional candidates.
   If Congress were to pass a free media requirement, the center
found, 54.9 percent of those surveyed said they would accept a
limit on overall campaign spending. That included 48 percent of the
incumbents running for re-election.
   Based on these and other findings, the center made a number of
recommendations aimed at providing free and lower-cost media
exposure to Senate and House candidates.
   ``No one of these changes can entirely replace the ubiquitous
30-second commercial, or drastically reduce the cost of
campaigns,'' the study said. ``But taken together, the center
believes that these proposals would make significant contributions
to the American electoral system.''
   First and foremost, the center said Congress should require
television stations to run two hours of special programming about
House races and two hours about Senate races each election season.
   Programs would have to be at least five minutes long. The time
could be turned over to candidates or the stations could produce
the material themselves. No station would have to cover all the
elections in its market.
   The center also recommended that the equal opportunities rule,
which forces broadcasters to give competing candidates comparable
air time, be changed to apply to only major party and strong
third-party candidates.
   If one candidate declines to debate, the center said, under some
circumstances the other should be given air time alone without
triggering equal-time rules.
   In addition, the center recommended that candidates receive 30
percent discounts on air time that cannot be pre-empted by
higher-paying advertisers. This was prompted by findings that
although candidates are entitled by law to discount rates, they
aren't using them.
   ``Candidates are inclined to pay higher rates to ensure that
their ads are not pre-empted,'' the study said. ``Overall, 54.2
percent of candidates preferred to purchase higher priced,
non-pre-emptible advertising time rather than lower cost,
pre-emptible time.''

   Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo claimed victory today
in Delaware's Democratic Senate primary, saying state officials had
discovered vote counting errors that he says reversed the results
of the election.
   Challenger Samuel Beard had been declared the winner of
Saturday's primary. Woo had conceded the race.
   Paul T. Hart, adminsitrative director of the Department of
Elections for New Castle County, said today a keypunch operator
made a mistake that gave Beard 2,800 more votes than he received.
   ``When this correction is made, Woo will instead win by six
votes,'' Woo said in a press release.
   But Hart said, ``I have no idea who is ahead.''
   The unofficial tally had given Beard 22,418 votes to Woo's
19,624. The revised results would give Beard only 19,618 votes to
Woo's 19,624.
   The final numbers, however, could change because votes from nine
precincts still must be counted. Woo also said he believes
additional absentee ballots will be counted.
   ``I have no idea how it happened, but I am satisfied in my own
mind that it was human error,'' Hart said today.
   Beard campaign manager Nathan Siegel had no comment.
   ``Sam doesn't think it is appropriate until the results are
completed,'' he said. ``Sam wants to have the most accurate and
clear count there is.''
   The vote discrepancy came in the 23rd representative district in
New Castle County, where there about 280 registered Democrats. In
that district, however, Beard's total was tallied at 2,828 votes
when he actually received only 28 votes, elections officials said.
A recount is expected.
   The New Castle County Board of Elections meets tonight to count
ballots from the nine precincts. New Castle County includes the
city of Wilmington.
   The winner of the primary will run against incumbent Sen.
William Roth Jr., R-Del., in the November general election.
   Woo had conceded the race Saturday night, saying ``I always said
it was a tough way to earn a living.''
   Woo, a 51-year-old physics professor at the University of
Delaware, was elected lieutenant governor four years ago in his
first bid for elected office.
   The lieutenant governor, who will leave his post in January, had
been considered a shoo-in for re-election, but chose instead to run
for the Senate.
   Beard had been heavily outspent by Woo, a native of Shanghai,
China, who enjoyed the financial backing of Chinese-Americans from
across the nation.
   Beard, 49, had the backing of most Democratic organization
leaders and labor.
   Beard, who has served as chairman for job creation commissions
under the last four presidents, said his experience in public
service helped in the campaign.
   The Senate race was the only statewide competition on the
ballot. Roth, seeking a fourth six-year term, is running unopposed.

   Many Eastford residents consider
themselves country folks, so town officials decided they could cope
with the bull that came out of the closet.
   A cast-iron bull on a weather vane was hidden in a closet for
more than 15 years because one official thought it looked too much
like, well, a bull, an anatomically correct bull.
   First Selectman James Whitehouse found the weather vane last
spring and had it mounted on the town office building.
   ``This is country, not the middle of the city,'' Whitehouse said.
   Officials say Robert P. Willis, chairman of the committee in
charge of building a new town hall in 1969, chided the contractor
for not including a free weather vane.
   ``In due time, a package arrived and was found to contain the
indicator. But a member of the board of selectmen took one look and
said, `Oh, that's just too, too much!''' Edwin W. Cooper, 90, wrote
recently in a local newspaper.
   The unidentified selectman, who no longer lives in Connecticut,
thought the weather vane would offend some people, said Cooper, who
retired this summer as the selectmen's clerk.
   ``He thought it was too explicit,'' Cooper said. ``Up close,
it's very apparent it's a bull.''
   So the bull went into the closet.

   Your grandmother always knew chicken soup
could cure a lot of ills, and now Holyoke Hospital is set to take
Grandma's place.
   Low-sodium, low-fat frozen chicken noodle and vegetable beef
soups were a natural outgrowth of the hospital's 2-year-old frozen
meal program for patients on restricted diets, said Patrick
Ascolese, food services manager.
   ``When we started we figured we would be satisfied if we were
able to sell 400 meals a month,'' Ascolese said. ``Now we are
selling 400 meals a week and we have some customers that drive more
than 100 miles one-way just to buy them.''
   Many commercial canned or dried soups contain hundreds of
milligrams of sodium. Holyoke Hospital's frozen ``Just What the
Doctor Ordered'' soup contains just 22 milligrams, Ascolese said.
   ``The typical restricted diet for a patient with high blood
pressure or heart trouble limits sodium intake to 1,000 milligrams
a day, so if they have a bowl of commercial soup for lunch, they
have pretty much used up the sodium allotment for the day.''
   Hospitals in Miami and San Francisco also have soups on their
take-out menus.
   Holyoke began test-marketing its soup Monday. Soups are packaged
in 7-ounce microwaveable containers that sell for 65 cents apiece.
   The take-out food program was initially aimed at recently
released patients on restricted diets, but customers also have
included the elderly and younger people trying to lose weight or
avoid preservatives, Ascolese said.

   Health officials immunized people in
Lynchburg and four surrounding counties Monday as they tried to
keep an outbreak of measles at the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Liberty
University from becoming a regional epidemic.
   ``We're trying now to keep it confined to the campus and keep it
from spreading to the community,'' said Dr. Joanna Harris, a state
Health Department official. ``We're hoping we're going to nip it in
the bud at this point.''
   With some 40 cases reported among students, faculty and people
who had visited the university, Ms. Harris estimated at least 200
more people will be sickened by rubeola measles.
   ``It's generally four times as high'' as the initial outbreak,
she said. Officials vaccinated 1,800 students, staff and faculty
over the weekend.
   Liberty University had not been quarantined, she said, but
people were advised not to go on campus until they have been
immunized.
   Free vaccinations were offered Monday at clinics in Lynchburg
and in the counties of Bedford, Campbell, Amherst and Appomattox.
   It was too soon to say how many people would be vaccinated.
   Health officials said people born before 1957, when
immunizations for the illness were first started, are generally
considered to be immune to rubeola measles.
   The disease strikes victims at first with a red rash that begins
on the face and chest and persists for about three days. The
disease can be fatal, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   ``There were four people who died last year in the United States
out of 3,655 cases,'' Ms. Harris said.
   The disease apparently came to the university by a student who
had the measles, she said.
   The measles also apparently were spread to Falwell's Thomas Road
Baptist Church by an infected Liberty student, Ms. Harris said.

   An F-14 fighter jet crashed into a
hangar today at an airfield, setting a row of hangars ablaze and
injuring at least three people, police and witnesses said.
   Two pilots bailed out of the plane to safety, according to
witnesses, who said the plane then smashed upside down at Gillespie
Field.
   Three people were confirmed injured in the 10:18 a.m. crash,
KFMB radio in San Diego reported. A dozen ambulances were at the
scene, the station said.
   The San Diego Blood Bank was calling for donations, said
spokeswoman Lynn Stedd, adding that supplies were below safety
levels.
   ``We understand that at least one of the victims is bleeding
profusely,'' she said. ``We don't know what else to anticipate as
far as injuries are concerned.''
   An El Cajon police spokesman said the plane was an F-14, and
that further details weren't immediately available. A Navy
spokesman who didn't give his name said officials from the Naval
Air Station at Miramar were en route to the crash.
   ``The plane was inverted flying over our location,'' said one
witness who was across the street from Gillespie Field. ``It kept
going in lower and lower and lower. I told a guy, `That plane is in
trouble, it's going down.'''
   ``It slammed upside down right on to a hangar,'' said the man,
who didn't give his name.
   The airfield is on the northern outskirts of this San Diego
County city.

   ``If we can improve streams for several years, we can allow the
remnant species to improve or at least to maintain itself,'' Dr.
Ronald Klauda, a Johns Hopkins University senior fisheries
biologist, told The (Baltimore) Sun in a story published Monday.
   This spring, Hopkins scientists began testing the idea of adding
lime to neutralize acid rain in Maryland streams.
   The idea was an extension of work done in the Northeast and
Canada, where government officials have fought acid rain by liming
acidic lakes. But buffering running water in a stream requires a
new technology, one on which experiments have just begun in this
country.
   If follow-up tests to the Hopkins work prove conclusive, the
scientists say liming could be a temporary solution to streams
affected greatly by increased acidity.
   The device is called a lime doser, a large, round concrete
structure that perches on the edge of a stream.
   When it rains, the doser sends measured amounts of a calcium and
water mixture into the stream, making the stream more hospitable
for fish.
   Two lime dosers were placed in Maryland streams in 1986. They
were computer-powered and cost about $40,000 each, too expensive
for Maryland to use in great numbers.
   But the new lime doser, placed on Stocketts Run in the Patuxent
River, is a new design that doesn't rely on a computer. This
version, costing $10,000 to $15,000, is the first to be put in a
stream in the United States, Klauda said.
   In some cases, the fish larvae below the doser had a
significantly higher survival rate, but in other cases it was only
marginally better, Klauda said.
   ``We don't know if they make a clear-cut difference in the
survival of eggs and larvae,'' he said.
   ``It might well turn out that for a few key streams still in
good shape or for streams that are trying to be restored, this
approach would work,'' said Michael Hirshfield, director of the
Chesapeake Bay research and monitoring division of the Maryland
Department of Natural Resources, which helped fund Klauda's
research with Living Lakes, a not-for-profit group funded by
utility companies.
   A survey last year found that at least 10 percent of the state's
rivers have acid levels that kill fish larvae under laboratory
conditions.

   Several used medical items were found on a
Manhattan sidewalk, and six boxes of a prescription antibiotic were
found on a playground, authorities said Monday.
   A used needle, syringe and three vials of blood were spotted by
a passerby, who called police Sunday night, said Jim Hart, a
spokesman for the Department of Sanitation.
   Doctors and medical labs are required by law to separate such
waste from regular garbage and dispose of it through special
private carters.
   Five doctors and two medical labs were listed at the address on
the Upper East Side where the items were found.
   The blood has not yet been tested, Hart said.
   The boxes on the playground on the west side of Manhattan
contained 10 packages each of the antibiotic Minocin, said Sgt.
Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman. The packages appeared to be
sample-size, he said.
   The passers-by who found the boxes Sunday brought them to police.
   ``Since the material has been washed up on the beaches, we have
seen an increase in reporting'' by citizens, Hart said.
   Medical waste has been found on sidewalks and in garbage bins
around the city this summer, and miles of beaches in New York and
New Jersey were closed for days after needles and other forms of
waste washed up.
   Last week, the first doctor was arrested in Manhattan on charges
of improperly disposing of medical waste.
   The growing problem of illegally disposed of medical waste
appears to stem from doctors or medical laboratories who do not
want to pay the added expense of using hauling companies that are
licensed to carry infectious waste, New York City Sanitation
Commissioner Brendan Sexton has said.

<HEAD>Yellowstone Smoke Affects Sky As Far As East Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Smoke from the forest fires in Yellowstone National Park has
drifted as far as the East Coast, turning sunsets a fiery red and
even affecting the weather.
   The setting sun ``had a kind of an eerie appearance,'' said
Allan Morrison of the National Weather Service in Chicago, about
1,200 miles east of the fires. The hazy smoke made the sun look
like ``a big glowing red ball ... it was a very red color which
made it spectacular in that regard.''
   The smoke was trapped in an upper atmospheric trough, about
15,000 to 20,000 feet up, and was carried by wind over the Great
Lakes, toward the East Coast and out to sea, said meteorologist Joe
Harrison of the weather service in New York City.
   The thin layer of smoke passed over the New York area Sunday,
dimming the sun to a reddish-orange and lowering temperatures
between 5 and 10 degrees, Harrison said.
   ``The only effect we`re having is it`s interfering with the
radiation of the sun,'' said Robert A. Armbrust, an air-quality
engineer with the New York state Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   Boston still had a thin, transparent layer of haze Monday, said
weather service meteorologist Tom Emerson.
   Usually, smoke from large fires is dispersed and is not
noticeable so far away, Harrison said.
   Because the smoke was so high up, the smell was not noticeable
on the ground and it did not contribute to air pollution, he added.
   Pilots reported seeing the smoke layer over Chicago when they
climbed to cruising altitudes of 30,000 and 40,000 feet, but no
visibility problems were reported.
   However, visibility was a problem closer to the fires. In
western South Dakota, about 400 miles east of the blazes,
visibility has been as low as half a mile, and foresters warned
that would hinder detection of local forest fires.
   Most of the smoke over Chicago cleared out over the weekend when
a front moved in, Morrison said.
   ``This should be the end of it, at least for now,'' Harrison
said in New York.
   ``It's a strange phenomenon,'' he added. ``It happens
occasionally with volcanoes. They spew smoke and it gets trapped in
a particular layer (of the atmosphere) and it can go all around the
globe.''

   Syrian troops today rescued an American
engineer who was abducted by gunmen in Lebanon, and turned him over
to the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, a source close to the Foreign
Ministry reported.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said Kenneth Wells, who works in
Saudi Arabia for Litton Industries, was taken captive in Lebanon
but overpowered his captors and escaped.
   The U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Wells was kidnapped Sunday as he was leaving his wedding reception.
They said his Lebanese bride was detained briefly.
   Wells subdued his abductors after several hours, reached a
Syrian army checkpoint and was escorted to Damascus, where he was
turned over to a U.S. Embassy official, the sources in Washington
said.
   The U.S. officials said Wells' mother reportedly lives in
Tennessee. According to one published report, Wells is 25 and his
wife, Samia, is 32. He is said to hold a black belt in karate.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, who confirmed much of
the account of Wells' experience, expressed gratitude to Syrian
authorities for their assistance. He said the episode underscores
the dangers American citizens face in Lebanon, where nine Americans
are held hostage.
   In the Syrian capital, the U.S. Embassy refused comment.
   The source close to the Foreign Ministry, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the American went to Lebanon to marry
a woman whose family lives in Baalbek.
   He said the American was kidnapped Sunday by unidentified gunmen
before he reached his fiancee's home. He said the man was found by
Syrian troops after an all night search.
   The American was freed and taken to Damascus, where Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa turned him over to U.S. charge d'affaires
John Craig, the source said.
   In Beirut, the Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio station gave
a different account.
   The radio said a man identified as Keith Paul Weiss, 25, married
Nadia Sharafeddine, 22, in Baalbek and that three gunmen
intercepted the newlyweds a few hours after the wedding.
   The Voice of Lebanon said the bridegroom ``who excels in
karate'' overpowered the gunmen, who were armed with automatic
rifles, disarmed them and took refuge at a Syrian army post. The
Syrians then drove him to Damascus, the radio said.
   The discrepancies between the various reports could not be
reconciled immediately.
   The Sharafeddines are a well-known Shiite Moslem family in
Baalbek, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is an extremist Shiite group that is
believed to be an umbrella for various factions holding 18 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   The hostage held the longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Newly Unified Opposition Demands Interim Government In Burma</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of anti-government demonstrators
marched through Rangoon on Monday, and opposition leaders demanded
that an interim government be appointed to supervise multiparty
elections.
   In other developments, more than 1,000 school children fasted in
support of the protesters, and the military said it would shoot
demonstrators spreading a report that two armed forces commanders
had threatened to join the protest.
   Gen. Saw Maung, Burma's defense minister and armed forces chief
of staff, said in a nationwide broadcast Monday night that the
public and military should support the government's plan to
supervise multiparty elections soon.
   Saw Maung said the military had allowed protesters to
demonstrate freely ``to avoid possible misunderstandings amidst
various attempts to discredit the armed forces by way of spreading
false rumors, propaganda and exaggerations.''
   Many thousands of student-led demonstrators marched through the
capital, shouting demands for an interim government and multiparty
democracy. At least five separate groups were counted, and
estimates of the total number of protesters ranged from 10,000 to
more than 100,000.
   More soldiers were seen on the streets Monday, but they did not
interfere with the protesters, who dispersed peacefully.
   In their first joint statement, opposition leaders again
demanded the formation of an interim government to lead the
transition to democracy.
   Opposition leaders Aung Gyi, former Defense Minister Tin Oo and
Aung San Suu Kyi listed their demands in a letter to Maung Maung. A
copy was given to The Associated Press. The government did not
immediately respond to the letter.
   None of the opposition leaders have specified who should be in
the interim government, saying only it should comprise people
outside the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party and who are
``acceptable to all the people.'' They also have not said if they
would be willing to serve in a transitional government.
   ``Since the government has lost the confidence of the nation,
people will have no confidence in the general elections to be held
by the government-appointed election supervision commission,'' it
said.
   ``We therefore demand the immediate formation of an interim
government to rebuild the economy, revive the administrative
machinery, reestablish democracy and hold general elections,'' it
said.
   President Maung Maung has rejected the call for an interim
government.
   But on Saturday he bowed to weeks of nationwide protests and
announced that the ruling party would relinquish its 26-year
monopoly on power and hold the first multiparty elections since
1960.
   Parliament on Sunday authorized the government to amend the
constitution to permit a multiparty system and hold the election
within six weeks.
   Students, ranging in age from about 10 to 17, fasted again
Monday at the Rangoon General Hospital compound, a longtime
rallying point for anti-government protests. The students, many
wearing school uniforms, held banners saying ``Give Us Democracy!''
and ``Give Us Interim Government!''
   The fast, which last 36 hours, ended Monday night.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said demonstrators were spreading false
rumors that two senior commanders threatened to attack government
buildings if authorities did not agree by Tuesday to form an
interim government.
   The threat was contained in unsigned, mimeographed leaflets
distributed in Rangoon that purportedly were issued by the navy's
vice chief, Rear Adm. Maung Maung Khin, and the air force's vice
chief, Maj. Gen. Tin Tun.
   ``This evening, false propaganda was spread through the
distribution of leaflets by cars and through announcements by
loudspeakers on the main streets of Rangoon city,'' the broadcast
said.
   ``The defense forces can no longer tolerate this and will open
fire if they come across this group of people,'' it said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Korten, the chief Justice Department
spokesman during former Attorney General Edwin Meese III's last
months in office, said Monday he is resigning.
   He will be replaced effective next week by Loye Miller, who is
press secretary and director of public affairs for the Department
of Education. Miller's boss, Education Secretary William Bennett,
is leaving office next week.
   Korten said he will do some writing for several months at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank where
Meese now works, and hopes eventually to return to broadcasting,
where he worked before joining the government.
   Korten was a staunch defender of Meese throughout a 14-month
criminal investigation of the attorney general's stock holdings and
actions on behalf of longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, who is now
under indictment in the Wedtech scandal.
   The criminal probe of Meese by independent counsel James McKay
ended without prosecution, although McKay said Meese probably broke
federal conflict-of-interest and tax laws.
   Korten said in an interview that he will remain at the Justice
Department for three or four weeks to assist in the transition to a
new director of public affairs.
   Korten, who has been under fire in recent days from aides to
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh for a trip Korten took to Japan
at public expense, said he told Thornburgh in July that he intended
to leave the department shortly.
   Miller, 50, a former political writer for the Knight-Ridder and
Newhouse newspaper groups, has known Thornburgh for several years
and has been at the Education Department since June 1985.
   Korten, 40, who spent 11 years in radio and television news
before joining the Reagan administration, came to the Justice
Department in July 1985 as the deputy director of public affairs.
   In May, he became director after Meese fired chief spokesman
Terry Eastland. Korten worked at the Office of Personnel Management
before coming to the Justice Department.

   The $12.8 million Minneapolis Sculpture
Garden, the nation's largest urban sculpture site, was called an
``artistic triumph'' by one official in its opening ceremony.
   About 3,000 artists, city and national officials and visitors
applauded as 10,000 pastel balloons rose from the 7.5-acre garden
and a high school band played on the 375-foot-long Irene Hixon
Whiteney bridge-sculpture in Saturday's ceremony.
   Claes Oldenburg of New York, the sculptor of the garden's
59-foot-long ``Spoonbridge and Cherry'' fountain, declared the
opening ``an epochal event.''
   The sculpture garden is the newest addition to the Minneapolis
park system's 170 facilities.
   It is one of the few U.S. sculpture gardens that is free and
open to the public year round.
   Walker director Martin Friedman and Park Superintendent David
Fisher officially opened the garden with giant scissors that
snipped a red ribbon tied between the garden's entrance portals, a
columnar sculpture by Chicago artist Martin Puryear.
   During the ceremony, Gov. Rudy Perpich said the garden was an
``artistic triumph'' that enhanced the cultural quality of life in
Minnesota ``with its unique blend of artistic vision, environmental
beauty, social generosity and professional optimism.''
   Artists admired each other's work and children climbed over the
artist-designed benches and patted Deborah Butterfield's bronze
horse, a sculpture that appears to be made of driftwood.
   ``Its really a neat place,'' said Rick Jabs of Richfield, adding
that he was especially impressed that children ``can touch the
sculpture.''
   Richard Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in
Los Angeles, said the garden contained an ``outstanding selection
of sculptures'' and was a model for other cities.
   Sculptor George Segal said the garden as an extraordinary place
to view sculpture and said its design and layout were ``serene,
classical, perfectly balanced.''

   Police said Monday they were baffled by
the disappearance of a 7-year-old girl who was discovered missing
from her bedroom Saturday.
   Authorities were trying to determine whether Jaclyn Dowaliby was
abducted by a relative, kidnapped, or had met with foul play.
Police said it was unlikely that she ran away.
   Jaclyn was last seen about 11 p.m. Friday when her mother,
Cindy, checked her bedroom. The girl's adoptive father, David
Dowaliby, discovered her missing at about 8 a.m. the next morning
when he checked her bedroom. Police said Dowaliby also discovered a
basement window in the house was broken and the front door of the
home was ajar.
   ``We haven't ruled out anything at this time, because we've just
got a lot of unanswered questions,'' said Capt. John Bittin of the
police force in this suburb south of Chicago.
   Bittin added, ``The fact that there was nothing disturbed in the
house, no signs of violent struggle, nobody heard anything, that
brings to mind ... questions, Bittin said.
   He said the case differs from a typical kidnapping. ``They're
not a wealthy family. There haven't been any calls or notes asking
for ransom,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, FBI agents have determined that the girl's imprisoned
father had nothing to do with the disappearance.
   James Guess, the child's natural father, was questioned Sunday
by FBI agents in Florida, where he is in prison, and expressed
shock about Jaclyn's disappearance, Bittin said.
   ``He was totally shocked, he was totally unaware of anything
that had happened,'' Bittin said. Based on statements from Guess,
the FBI has decided ``that he had nothing to do with it,'' the
captain said.
   Bittin said he did not know why Guess was imprisoned. A
spokesman for the FBI did not immediately return telephone calls.
   FBI agents planned interviews Monday with relatives of the
natural father.
   Also Monday, local and state police continued their foot-search
in wooded areas near the girl's home. A canine unit was used to
search a nearby field, but found no clues.
   He said there was no reason to suspect foul play ``other than
the fact that we haven't been able to locate her. Unfortunately,
the possibilty is always there for that ... but we don't have any
proof one way or the other.''
   Jaclyn was described by police as being about 4 feet tall and
weighing about 60 pounds. She has shoulder-length brown hair and
blue eyes.

<HEAD>Panel Recommends No Suspension For City Councilman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Councilman Hosea Williams need not be
suspended from office over his weapons indictment since the charge
does not involve his performance in office, a special panel
reported Monday to the governor.
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris appointed the panel last month after
Williams' indictment on a felony weapons charge, which stemmed from
an incident in March at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   Security officers found a handgun in Williams' briefcase as he
passed through a checkpoint. The charge was later made a felony
after Williams was cited as a habitual violator; he has a string of
traffic violations.
   A 1984 state law provides for the governor to appoint a
three-member panel to investigate the cases of public officials
under indictment. The panel recommends whether suspension from
office is in order.
   Attorney General Michael Bowers previously said such a panel was
not required in Williams' case, since his indictment did not
involve his official duties. But Harris disagreed.
   The panel, composed of Bowers, Augusta City Councilman Gerald
Woods and Columbus City Councilman A.J. McClung, voted unanimously
Monday against recommending that Harris suspend Williams.
   Bowers said the panel found the indictment ``did not relate to
or adversely impact the administration of his office'' or the
rights and interests of the public.
   Williams, a veteran civil rights activist, has said he routinely
carries a gun for protection. He explained the airport incident by
saying he had removed the gun from his car and put it in his
briefcase, then forgot to leave it behind before heading for his
flight.
   At the time, Williams was cited and allowed to make his plane.
Clayton County officers later arrested Williams on the felony
charge.

<HEAD>Officials: War Against Mediterranean Fruit Flies In Final Stage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1 million effort to rid the San Fernando
Valley of the destructive Mediterranean fruit fly apparently
succeeded, officials say.
   Officials plan to intensify trapping efforts for a month more,
however, and hope to declare the pest eradicated if no more wild
Medflies show up by the end of October, said William Edwards, chief
deputy to the Los Angeles County agricultural commissioner.
   A state quarantine barring anyone from removing home-grown
produce from 62 square miles of the valley will remain in effect
until eradication is declared, Dorthea Zadig, program manager of
the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said Monday.
   Six wild Medflies were discovered in the state's traps in late
July, but no new flies have been found since, Ms. Zadig said.
   Bob Atkins, pest prevention division supervisor of the Los
Angeles County Agriculture Commission, said officials are
optimistic.
   ``I think we'll be able to announce eradication by the end of
October,'' he said.
   The attack included a one-time pesticide treatment followed by
the release of millions of sterile male Medflies and imposition of
a quarantine on home-grown produce.
   The Medfly, a severe threat to California's multibillion-dollar
agricultural industry, is considered one of the most destructive
crop-damaging pests because it preys on more than 250 varieties of
produce, reproduces rapidly and survives in different climates,
officials said.
   By the end of August, one complete generation of Medflies is
thought to have come and gone since officials began releasing the
sterile male flies, Ms. Zadig said. The sterile fly release will
continue at a rate of 40 million a week for one more generation,
through this month, she said.

   Nine women dressed in black pulled
stockings over their faces in court Monday and began chanting,
claiming to invoke the presence of a murder victim at an
arraignment for the accused.
   ``Your action will come back to you. Every action will have
consequences,'' the women chanted, pointing at Alan Jose Reyes, 32,
of Turner Falls.
   Reyes' girlfriend, Virginia Ferrer, 27, was stabbed several
times in the heart in an alley outside her home while one of their
children reportedly watched. She died early Saturday.
   Reyes is charged in Greenfield District Court with murder,
assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and disorderly conduct.
   The women began chanting as soon as Reyes' case was announced.
Their stocking masks contained runs and holes outlined with what
appeared to be red nail polish.
   ``We will avenge Virginia's death,'' they said. ``Virginia is
here. You should have known Virginia is here. This is not that
man's first day in court.''
   A recess was called and police escorted the women outside. They
continued to chant until they reached the sidewalk, where they
began laughing hysterically. They refused to say if they were
members of a women's advocacy organization.
   ``We're all Virginia from Turners Falls,'' they said. ``We're
women. Virginia is not the only woman,'' they said.
   Reyes pleaded innocent before District Judge Edward J. Shea.

   Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston
on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs
off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
   No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of
750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane
around noon.
   For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing
branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through
the air.
   The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston's
airport and aircraft parked on its fields.
   The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the
city. Skies brightened, the winds died down and people waited for
an hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived.
   All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International
Airport.
   Flights from the Cayman Islands, reportedly next in the path of
the hurricane, arrived in Miami packed with travelers cutting short
their vacations. ``People were running around in the main lobby of
our hotel (on Grand Cayman Island) like chickens with their heads
cut off,'' said one man.
   A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was moving
west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. It said
Jamaica would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would cause
flash floods and mud slides.
   ``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
   ``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that
island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful
hurricane,'' he said.
   Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico,
Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issued
Monday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the Cayman
Islands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for the
Dominican Republic.
   High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingston
overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering
streets with branches.
   Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding up
windows in preparation for the hurricane.
   The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of the
mountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as much
damage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urged
residents to seek higher ground.
   Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were
evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation's
southeastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush the
island.
   In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various
precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the
hurricane.
   Lt. Ken Ross, a spokesman, said the Navy station at Guantanamo
reported that as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the brunt of the storm appeared
to be passing southeastern Cuba. ``They have reported maximum winds
of 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots,'' said Ross. ``But there are
no reports of injuries or damage.''
   The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved to
``Condition Two,'' meaning electrical power usage was cut back to
only essential uses and ``all non-essential personnel sent to their
barracks.''
   The storm also skirted Puerto Rico without causing any damage to
military facilities, Ross said.
   Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the Cayman
Islands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veer
northwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Residents of the
neighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, were
urged to ``rush all preparatory actions.''
   The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans could
expect high waters and large waves ``which may undermine buildings
along the beaches.''
   ``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to
monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service
advised.
   Forecaster Hal Gerrish on Sunday described Gilbert ``certainly
one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long
time.''

<HEAD>Clint Eastwood Donates Collection To Wesleyan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like the movie character Dirty Harry,
Wesleyan University got its man.
   After three years of pursuing actor Clint Eastwood, the
Middletown university has scored a hit. Eastwood has agreed to
donate all film and documents relating to his professional acting,
producing and directing career to the Clint Eastwood Cinema
Collection at Wesleyan and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
   The museum will hold the original prints of Eastwood's films,
starting with ``Play Misty for Me,'' the 1971 thriller which
Eastwood starred in and directed.
   Wesleyan's Cinema Archives will receive all other material that
Eastwood has been collecting and storing at Warner Brothers studios
in Hollywood.
   Jeanine Basinger, the archive's curator, said the collection is
likely to include scripts, photographs, correspondence and other
``working papers.'' She said the full contents of Eastwood's
collection won't be known until it is received at Wesleyan and
catalogued.
   Once the material arrives, Eastwood will join the likes of
directors Frank Capra and Elia Kazan with collections at Wesleyan.
   ``He's a unique American artist. He has made films that are
distinctively original,'' she said Monday, noting that the
university's film students have studied Eastwood films in the
classroom since 1971.
   The Wesleyan archives, created in 1985, also includes the
collection of actress Ingrid Bergman, as well as a collection of
films, papers from the Omnibus performing arts television show, and
a collection of American movie posters.
   Basinger said Eastwood has apparently saved everything stemming
from his career, including from the days when he was a regular on
the television show, ``Rawhide.'' She said Eastwood's collection
wasn't the result of ``star vanity, but from a serious,
professional career.''
   Eastwood told The New York Times that his relationship with the
Museum of Modern Art began in 1980, when it showed his ``Bronco
Billy'' in 1980 at the conclusion of week-long retrospective.

   The conspiracy trial of former beauty queen Bess
Myerson doesn't begin until Wednesday, but the rush to get press
credentials for the highly publicized divorce-fixing case began
early Monday, very early.
   William Cohen, a researcher for the Los Angeles Times, showed up
at 2 a.m. and found two guys already on line outside the courthouse.
   The early birds, recent graduates from Dartmouth and Columbia,
were holding a place for a reporter for the magazine Vanity Fair,
said Cohen.
   ``It was actually very funny,'' said Cohen, himself a recent
Columbia graduate. ``There we were in the middle of the night,
three Ivy League grads standing around telling jokes and waiting to
get in.''
   Within hours they were joined by a dozen more place-holders,
sketch artists, reporters and writers seeking the 19 remaining
seats allotted to the news media in the tiny courtroom where the
trial will be held.
   ``None of us slept well for two days over the weekend, worrying
about it,'' said Richard Tomlinson, a courtroom artist for WNYW-TV,
who got to the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan at 4:45 a.m.
   The trip downtown turned into a nightmare for Tomlinson, who got
stuck at an unattended subway exit that wasn't supposed to open
until 7 a.m. Eventually ``two subway workers came out of the dark
with lanterns'' and freed him.
   The object of the news media anxiety is what may be one of New
York's most sensational criminal trials in years.
   Miss Myerson, a former Miss America and one-time city cultural
affairs commissioner, is charged with giving a city job to the
daughter of the judge presiding over her boyfriend's divorce in a
bid to lighten his alimony and child support load.
   Jury selection is to begin Wednesday for the trial of Miss
Myerson; her boyfriend, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso; and the divorce
judge, former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel.
   The three are charged with mail fraud and conspiracy for an
alleged scheme to fix Capasso's 1985 divorce. Miss Myerson also is
charged with obstruction of justice.
   Seating is limited because no large courtroom was available at
the 31-story federal courthouse.
   ``The larger courtrooms had already been scheduled months in
advance for other trials,'' explained Clifford P. Kirsch, the chief
non-judicial administrator of the courthouse.
   Despite an informal request by reporters to find something
bigger, U.S. District Judge John Keenan elected to stay in his
regular courtroom, which only seats about 50 spectators.
   Kirsch set aside about 30 seats for the news media: 11 for the
resident courthouse press corps and the remaining 19 for artists
and reporters on a first-come, first-served basis.
   ``The judge made a combination of such strictures that it was
designed to limit all but the most determined,'' complained Daily
News artist Joe Papin, the fourth artist on line, who arrived at 6
a.m.
   There were seats for six artists, and Ruth Pollack of WPIX-TV
was the seventh artist on line.
   However, because ``I got there seconds after the sixth artist
and I was the last artist on line,'' officials made an exception
and gave her a pass.
   All of the passes were handed out by 9 a.m.
   Out of luck, and on the growing waiting list, were such news
organizations as USA Today, Cable News Network and National Public
Radio.

   No more rap-music concerts will be held at
Nassau Coliseum pending an investigation into violence that left
one man stabbed to death and 13 others injured, a spokeswoman said
Monday.
   Police said Monday the gang responsible for the death of Julio
Fuentes, 19, of the Bronx, was well organized and had planned to
create a disturbance.
   Fuentes was stabbed in the heart Saturday night while attending
``Jam '88,'' which featured Eric B. and Rakim, Kool Moe Dee and
Doug E. Fresh.
   The killing was the latest in a series of violent incidents at
rap concerts around the nation, including two stabbings during a
Run-DMC concert at the Nassau Coliseum last month.
   ``They came to chain snatch, rob, and beat, slash, and stab
anyone who resisted them,'' said Detective Sgt. John Nolan.

<HEAD>Vermont Senator Begins Farewell Series of Speeches on Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Robert Stafford, a New Englander of few
words, on Monday began an unusual swan song for a retiring member
of Congress.
   The Vermont Republican, ending his Capitol Hill career in
January after 17 years in the Senate and 11 in the House, took to
the Senate floor for five minutes to discuss atmospheric
contamination, his phrase for air pollution.
   Stafford, who has rarely made appearances during the Senate's
daily free-talk periods, says he will be pointing out national and
worldwide air-quality problems every day the Senate meets for the
rest of his term. The Senate hopes to adjourn in early to
mid-October.
   ``It is one of my remaining hopes that, before this senator
leaves this chamber for the last time, the groundwork will have
been laid here that will help the United States and the world
respond to this threat,'' said Stafford, who chaired the
Environment Committee when Republicans controlled the Senate from
1981 to 1987.
   ``I propose not only to set down the challenges we face but also
to offer some solutions,'' he said. ``It is not too late to correct
our errors of the past.''

<HEAD>FBI Kept 18-Year Dossier on Congressman, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI kept an 18-year dossier on the
late Democratic Rep. Phillip Burton and furnished documents to
President Lyndon Johnson purporting to detail Burton's
``pro-communist record,'' the Oakland Tribune reported Monday.
   The newspaper said the FBI had furnished it with 231 pages of
files on Burton, some of them heavily censored, and withheld nearly
400 pages, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request
submitted 27 months ago.
   Burton represented San Francisco in the state Assembly from 1956
until his election to the U.S. House in 1964, and remained a
congressman until his death in 1983. The FBI files cover 1953 to
1971, the Tribune said.
   Among other things, the files show that the FBI tried to block
appointment of a Burton aide as San Francisco postmaster, kept
Director J. Edgar Hoover informed of details of Burton's
activities, and compiled unflattering information about the
congressman's family, the newspaper said.
   FBI spokesman Bill Carter said Monday he was unaware of the
files and could not comment but said the FBI has since come under
new guidelines.
   Now, ``if a member of Congress has committed or is conspiring to
commit some violation of the law, certainly we would have an
investigation,'' but not otherwise, Carter said.
   Assemblyman John Burton, the congressman's brother, said he had
not seen the files but called the report ``more proof of Hoover's
paranoia. He used to see Communists under his bed.''
   The files say Johnson inquired about Burton's background in 1964
and was sent a series of documents from the FBI the next year. The
documents referred repeatedly to Burton's association with the
National Lawyers' Guild, and criticized his attempt to scrap
loyalty oaths for lawmakers and his opposition to the House
Un-American Activities Committee, the Tribune said.
   Also in 1964, Burton traveled to Mississippi to observe the
search for three missing civil rights workers later found murdered.
Then-Assistant FBI Director Cartha DeLoach recommended that agents
on the scene receive Burton politely but tell him nothing about the
investigation, the newspaper said.
   A December 1965 memo from the FBI's San Francisco field office
recommended that, in light of Burton's ``very questionable
background,'' Hoover oppose appointment of the congressman's
administrative assistant, Lim P. Lee, as San Francisco's postmaster.
   The field office urged that damaging information on Lee be
forwarded to the White House. Lee was appointed, however, and
served as postmaster for 14 years.
   The dossier also cites instances in which Burton criticized
statements by Hoover.
   After Hoover in 1969 called the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
``the most notorious liar in America,'' Burton approached the FBI's
chief San Francisco agent at a party in a ``very belligerent
manner'' and said Hoover's statement had been ``off-base,'' the
agent said in a memo to Hoover.
   Also in 1969, the files quote Burton attacking as disparaging to
Chinese-Americans a statement by Hoover that some Chinese-Americans
``would assist Red China in supplying needed material (for
espionage) or promoting Red Chinese propaganda.''
   An unnamed FBI official said in a report that Burton was ``a
longtime apologist for Communist China,'' and recommended that the
FBI ``set him straight'' about the Communist ``menace.''

   Vice President George Bush won endorsements
Monday from former national security advisers to Presidents Nixon,
Ford and Carter as he assembled a bipartisan team of advisers on
foreign policy and defense issues.
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, the most prominent Democrat on the
13-member panel, told reporters he was proud to have served Carter
but said Bush _ rather than Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis _
``can best fashion an effective bipartisan foreign policy.''
   Said Brzezinski: ``He is not a novice in that critical area of
public policy on which our national survival depends.''
   Bush took the occasion to accuse Dukakis of tending to rely on
the United Nations and other international bodies to resolve
foreign crises. ``We cannot abdicate our responsibility for
leadership,'' he said.
   The panel also includes Henry Kissinger, national security
adviser to Nixon and secretary of state under Ford, and Brent
Scowcroft, who was Ford's national security adviser.
   Others named to the largely Republican panel were former
Secretary of State Alexander Haig, former ambassador Anne
Armstrong, former White House chief of staff Howard Baker; Melvin
Laird and Donald Rumsfeld, former secretaries of defense; Sens.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Richard Lugar,
R-Ind.; former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, and retired Adm. Elmo R.
Zumwalt Jr., former chief of naval operations.
   Brzezinski's endorsement of Bush was ``not unexpected,'' said
Mark Gearan, a spokesman at Dukakis campaign headquarters in Boston.
   ``We will be watching to see whether Mr. Brzezinski will be
drafting speeches for George Bush on the foreign policy of Jimmy
Carter,'' said Gearan, alluding to repeated GOP attacks on Carter's
tenure.
   On Monday, Dukakis delivered the first of three major campaign
speeches this week that are intended to counter Republican
allegations that he is weak on defense and naive about foreign
affairs.
   ``The primary foreign policy objective of the Dukakis
administration can be stated very simply: to restore respect for
American leadership in a changing world,'' Dukakis told a campaign
rally in Philadelphia.
   He accused Bush of failed leadership in combating terrorism,
drug trafficking and U.S. deficits in world trade.
   Dukakis has no formal advisory panel of national security
experts for his campaign. Madeleine Albright has been his chief
foreign affairs adviser for the past year.
   In addition to Ms. Albright, who served in the Carter White
House and is a professor at Georgetown University, Dukakis receives
advice on those issues from Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., and a trio from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University. They are Joseph Nye, Graham Allison and Albert
Carnesdale.
   Kissinger said in a statement he had ``read everything I could
find on foreign and national security policy uttered by Gov.
Dukakis _ which is admittedly a skimpy body of work.''
   ``I am convinced that his views on national security are
incompatible with a strong America, his approach to East-West
relations would undermine our ability to move the Soviet Union
toward more responsible behavior, and his view of international
affairs would keep us from shaping the new world decades of
dedication have brought into view,'' Kissinger said.
   Scowcroft told the same news conference that Dukakis ``is
without experience in foreign affairs, and his penchant for
multilateral diplomacy fails to recognize the vital role of dynamic
U.S. leadership in moving regional conflicts toward resolutions
compatible with U.S. interests.''

<HEAD>US Lowers Forecast of Soviet Grain Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for this year's grain harvest in the
Soviet Union have deteriorated somewhat because of a drop in some
yields, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The Soviet crop is now expected to produce about 205 million
metric tons, a reduction of 5 million tons from projections a month
ago, officials said. The lowered estimate was based primarily on
early yield results released by the Soviets and on the Sept. 7
disclosure on Moscow television that the grain harvest would be
less than expected.
   Reduced production estimates included barley, 47.5 million tons,
down 3 million tons from the August forecast; rye, 16.5 million
tons, down 1 million; and oats, 16.5 million, down 1 million.
   The Soviet Union also is expected to boost grain imports further
to about 27 million tons in 1988-89, an increase of 2 million tons
from indications last month but still short of the 32 million tons
imported in 1987-88.
   ``Over the past month, numerous reports have been received of
U.S.S.R. grain purchases, breaking the lull in Soviet grain buying
activity that had prevailed since last spring,'' the report said.
``The bulk of the recent purchases have been coarse grains (such as
corn), although reports have also indicated wheat sales by some of
the major suppliers.''

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha of South Africa,
on his first summit-level mission into black Africa, met Monday
with leaders of Mozambique's Marxist government, which has blamed
much of its woes on Botha's nation.
   President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique shook hands with Botha
at an airfield welcoming ceremony, then took him on a tour by jeep
of the nearby Cahora Bassa hydroelectric project before a two-hour
meeting.
   Afterward, Botha said he invited Chissano to visit South Africa
and the two leaders issued a joint communique affirming their
support for regional cooperation. They said committees would be
formed to deal with issues such as trade, economic development and
migrant labor.
   South Africa has signed an agreement to help rehabilitate the
Cahora Bassa project, in the northwestern province of Tete. The
power line leading to South Africa from the dam near Songo has been
sabotaged repeatedly by guerrillas which Mozambique claims are
aided by Botha's security forces.
   Chissano said Botha gave assurances that South Africa was not
helping the rebels.
   Botha was to go to Malawi later for talks Tuesday with President
Hastings Kamuzu Banda. Malawi is the only African state that has
full diplomatic ties with South Africa.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites have
established a racially segregated society and the 26 million blacks
have no vote in national affairs.
   Botha and Chissano were to discuss a mutual non-aggression
treaty signed by their countries in 1984.
   The treaty lapsed in 1985 when Mozambique produced evidence that
South Africa violated the agreement by continuing to assist the
Mozambique National Resistance, or RENAMO. That guerrilla movement
began an insurgency two years after Mozambique won independence
from Portugal in 1975.
   The civil war, combined with drought, has left millions of
Mozambicans homeless and hungry.
   Many Western governments, including the United States, have
increased aid to Mozambique and support its claim that the rebels
receive covert logistical and communications aid from South Africa.
   South Africa insists it no longer helps the rebels, and Botha
was expected to attempt to persuade Chissano to mute the
allegations.
   Botha was accompanied on his trip by his Defense Minister Gen.
Magnus Malan and Foreign Minister Pik Botha. Chissano's delegation,
which left the capital of Maputo for Songo early today, included
three Cabinet ministers and two military commanders, according to
the Mozambican news agency AIM.
   As part of an effort to improve its regional image, South Africa
has in the past year expanded its trade mission in Maputo and
pursued economic development possibilities in Mozambique.
   The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at
rehabilitating the Cahora Bassa project in Tete so South Africa can
purchase power.
   The rebels repeatedly have sabotaged power lines leading from
Cahora Bassa to South Africa.
   Even when their relations were badly strained, Mozambique and
South Africa maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of
Mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in South Africa,
and Maputo's electricity is supplied by South Africa.
   During his 10 years in power, Botha has had few chances to
travel in black Africa. In 1986, he was one of numerous dignitaries
who attended the coronation of Swaziland's King Mswati III, and in
1987 he made a secret visit to South African troops fighting in
Angola.
   He had hoped to visit Brazzaville, Congo, earlier this year in
conjunction with peace talks on Angola and South-West Africa, or
Namibia, but Angola's Cuban allies reportedly threatened to scuttle
the talks if he came.

   A minister went on trial Monday on
charges of beheading a handyman and burning down his church in an
alleged attempt to assume a new identity and disappear with $50,000
in church money.
   Jury selection is expected to take most of the week in the
first-degree murder and arson trial of the Rev. John David Terry,
who faces the death penalty if convicted.
   Terry may take the witness stand to break his yearlong silence
in the decapitation of James C. Matheny.
   The slaying and fire on June 15, 1987, at Emmanuel Church of
Christ Pentecostal Oneness stunned Terry's parishioners. Some have
stuck by him since Matheny's body was found rolled up in a scorched
carpet.
   ``Two days before this happened we would have given him our last
dime,'' said Marsha Brown, 30, who with others in the 40-member
congregation has been attending weekly services in a borrowed
building in nearby Gallatin. ``I don't feel personally betrayed.
More let down than anything else.''
   About half the members have stopped attending services, she said.
   ``I'm sad for him. I guess I'm a little bitter, but you have to
keep the love of God no matter what,'' said Marlane McClanahan, 35,
who has not been attending services held by the current pastor, the
Rev. Wayne Cole.
   Mrs. Brown, Mrs. McClanahan and other church members said Terry,
43, was well-liked and respected during his nearly 20 years as
their preacher. Terry had befriended Matheny, who was the
ex-husband of a church member and had been in trouble with the law.
   Police initially thought it was Terry's body firefighters
discovered in the carpet because Terry's belt and other articles of
clothing were found on the body. The head and lower part of the
right arm had been severed with butcher-like precision, and Matheny
initially was suspected of killing Terry until medical examiners
identified the body.
   Terry, who had worked part-time as a supermarket butcher to earn
extra money, showed up at his lawyer's office two days after the
fire. His lawyers have since turned over to authorities a map of a
marina where they said the head and arm could be found, though a
search begun last week was halted Sunday after divers came up
empty-handed.
   ``The divers can't see anything. They can only feel. It's zero
visibiliy'' in Lake Barkley, said Stewart County Sheriff David
Hicks.
   A birth certificate, driver's license, post office box and the
title to a motorcycle like the one seen whizzing away from the fire
have turned up in the name of a man dead since 1951, court
documents show. Terry's picture was on the driver's license that
bore the dead man's name.
   Neither Terry's lawyer nor the prosecution would discuss details
the case. Terry is not charged in connection with the money taken
from the church.
   Teresa Matheny, 32, was divorced from the victim but said the
two were close to a reconciliation. Mrs. Matheny, who lives in
Nashville, stopped attending church services soon after her
husband's body was found.
   ``I loved him very much,'' she said.
   Mrs. Matheny said the slaying and arrest of Terry have been
difficult for the 4-year-old son she and Matheny had. ``It's been
real hard for him to understand,'' she said.
   Members of the denomination formed in the early 1930s believe in
faith healing and sometimes practice such rituals as foot washing
and talking in tongues.
   Terry's former parishioners are looking ahead to the
Thanksgiving opening of a new church under construction on the
other side of town from their old meeting place.
   ``He was a friend,'' said Virginia Howard, 63, another church
member. ``We had known him since he was a boy. Our children and he
grew up together. There wasn't anything ever bad about the boy. He
just did good things. We're amazed that someone we've known and
never knew anything bad against is guilty of this.''

<HEAD>US Holds Off Decision on Israeli Request for Diplomatic Immunity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel is seeking diplomatic immunity for 47
staff members of its military procurement office in New York but
has been unable to win State Department consent after months of
intermittent talks, U.S. officials said Monday.
   The officials said the office has been investigated for
involvement in two cases of illegal export of American military
technology, but they could not confirm a published report that the
Justice Department and the FBI oppose the Israeli request because
of law enforcement considerations.
   According to the officials, who insisted on anonymity, majority
sentiment at the State Department appeared to be in support of the
Israeli request.
   They said that members of an Egyptian military procurement
office in Washington have been given diplomatic immunity. And they
noted that an Egyptian military officer who worked at the office
was arrested by U.S. authorities earlier this year in an alleged
plot to smuggle missile components to Egypt.
   The officer was freed after claiming diplomatic immunity and has
since returned to Egypt.
   Israel is seeking a limited form of diplomatic immunity known as
consular immunity for the 47 Israelis in New York. This would
provide protection only for activities directly connected to a
person's official functions, not for all crimes.
   But according to officials quoted in Monday's editions of The
Washington Post, this would be sufficient to shield from U.S.
prosecution a foreign national suspected of involvement in the
illegal export of U.S. military technology.
   Responding to the Post story, Alon Liel, the Israeli Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Jerusalem, said Israel has been trying for 18
months to get diplomatic status for dozens of Israeli
representatives of various ministries, including defense, economics
and tourism.
   Liel said so far Washington has refused because these officials
are not working out of the Israeli Embassy in Washington.
   ``We are not only speaking about the guys in the military
purchasing office,'' Liel said. ``It also includes people from the
ministries of tourism and economics. These people have been sent
over by the state of Israel, and they are not given full diplomatic
status. It's a matter of principle.''
   According to to Post, the Israeli request poses ``legal and
diplomatic'' problems about how the U.S. government should deal
with purchasing office employees suspected of seeking to smuggle
American military technology out of the country.
   The Post said the FBI and the Justice Department are opposed to
the Israeli request.
   The newspaper said the Justice Department in July 1986 sought to
investigate eight Israelis in New York suspected of the illegal
export of machinery needed to manufacture cluster bombs. The
department concluded last spring that it lacked sufficient evidence
for criminal prosecution.
   Another case last November involved a Connecticut company that
paid fines of $750,000 for violating U.S. export laws by smuggling
equipment and technology to Israel for the manufacture of
chrome-plated cannon barrels. The Post said the exact role of the
Israeli purchasing office was never made clear.

<HEAD>Despite Renovation, Kids Can't See Animals At Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some exhibits in the children's section of the
Lincoln Park Zoo are so flawed youngsters can't even see the
animals, despite a $2.5 million renovation, zoo officials said.
   The main problems are in the new outdoor otter and raccoon
exhibits, where a natural-looking rock wall was built as a safety
barrier to separate the children from the animals, said Edward
Uhlir, director of engineering for the district.
   ``None of the kids can see over the boulders,'' said Susan
Fisher-Yellen, who recently took her 3-year-old daughter to the zoo.
   ``I saw 20 or 30 kids climbing on those boulders,'' Ms.
Fisher-Yellen said.
   ``No question there are sight-line problems for little kids,''
said zoo Director Lester Fisher. ``I'm 6-foot-1. I can look in, but
if I were 4 feet, I couldn't. You just had to get down on your
knees and know this isn't workable.''
   Zoo officials want the architectural firm that designed the
exhibits, Hammond, Beeby & Babka, to correct the problems.
   The architects said the plans were approved by the Park
District, which owns and operates the zoo, and by the Lincoln Park
Zoological Society, a private, non-profit group that helped fund
the renovation.
   Neither the architects nor the zoo knew how much the changes
would cost.

   The official, an aide to Interior Minister Abdullah Rassi, said
the 55-year-old businessman was freed at midnight in the luxurious
Verdun neighborhood of west Beirut, outside the minister's home.
   The aide spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It was unclear why the captors chose to free Cordes there.
Earlier statements Monday said Cordes would be released at the
seaside Beaurivage Hotel, close to the command headquarters of the
Syrian army's peacekeeping contingent in west Beirut.
   Dozens of journalists had gathered at the hotel for the
anticipated release after three statements from the kidnappers
announcing that Cordes would be freed.

   That statement was accompanied by a polaroid photograph of

   Gottelmann arrived at the hotel an hour after the 9 p.m.

   The death toll from the Ramstein air

of his injuries, West German officials said.
   Bernd Horion, a spokesman for Rhineland Palatinate state, said
the West German man died at a Ludwigshafen clinic, more than two
weeks after the world's worst air show catastrophe.
   Horion said 15 people remained in critical condition at
hospitals in West Germany. A total of 156 people were hospitalized
in 46 clinics, he said.
   On Aug. 28, an Italian air force stunt team jet fighter collided
with two other Italian jets and crashed into spectators at the U.S.
Air Force base at Ramstein in southwestern Germany. All three
pilots were among those killed.

<HEAD>Congress Provides Money For Whooping Cranes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation is on its way to President Reagan
providing money to buy the last privately held land on a Texas
island that is a wintering ground for the world's only surviving
flock of whooping cranes that breeds in the wild.
   The Interior Department appropriations bill, passed last week by
Congress, provides $5.5 million for the purchase of 5,017 acres at
the southern tip of Matagorda Island, officials say.
   The purchase will be the government's third and final
acquisition from the Texas Nature Conservancy, bringing the
federally owned tract on the Gulf Coast barrier island to 11,502
acres.
   With the growth of the flock over the past four decades, the
whooping cranes have had to search for new wintering grounds away
from their traditional winter home on nearby Aransas National
Wildlife Refuge.
   Bruce Thompson, in charge of Texas' non-game and endangered
species program, said as many as 150 whooping cranes are expected
to make the journey this fall from Northwest Territories, Canada,
to Texas. Last year, 132 cranes wintered around the Aransas refuge,
with two others ending up elsewhere in Texas.
   Another flock of about 20 cranes winters in New Mexico and
summers in Idaho, but Thompson said those cranes have not yet
reproduced in the wild. A flock of about 40 is kept in captivity at
the Patuxent Wildlife Refuge in Maryland.

<HEAD>GAO Report Says 500 Regulators Earning More Than Allowed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 500 federal savings institution
regulators have been illegally exempted from government salary
limits, according to a congressional report released Monday.
   The General Accounting Office, in a report for Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark., said employees of three subsidiaries of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board are, in fact, federal employees and should be
subject to civil service pay classifications. The top civil service
salary is $75,500 a year.
   The bank board, which regulates the nation's 3,000 savings
associations, has set up the three subsidiaries since 1972, in two
of the cases specifically to get around salary limits. Top
executives of the subsidiaries are paid six-figure salaries.
   The Office of Regulatory Activities was created in 1986 as the
Office of Regulatory Policy, Oversight and Supervision, or ORPOS,
to formulate regulations and to oversee S&L examiners that work for
the 12 district Federal Home Loan Banks. It has 146 employees.
   The district banks serve as a central banking system for the
savings and loan industry and are outside of the federal
bureaucracy, but the GAO said regulatory office employees took over
functions previously conducted by the board itself and should be
considered part of the federal government.
   A second subsidiary, the Federal Asset Disposition Association,
was set up in 1985 to dispose of billions in dollars of loans and
foreclosed real estate from failed S&Ls. It is the largest of the
three with 313 employees.
   Its president, Gerald P. Carmen, is a former head of the General
Services Administration, which manages government property, and a
former political fund raiser for President Reagan. He is paid
$150,000 a year.
   The third entity, the Office of Finance, has 52 employees and
was formed in 1972 to oversee the issuance of debt to fund the bank
board and the district banks.
   ``We believe the bank board acted improperly in creating ORPOS,
the Office of Finance and FADA as entities whose employees are not
subject to the salary limitations,'' Milton J. Socolar, special
assistant to the comptroller general, said in a letter to Pryor.
   According to bank board officials, the effects of forcing the
three subsidiary agencies to abide by the salary caps is
potentially devastating. Analysts in part blame the S&L industry's
problems on the inability of the bank board in the early 1980s to
pay enough to attract experienced examiners.
   By placing the examiners outside of salary caps, the bank board
has been able to build up its staff, in part by hiring examiners
away from other banking agencies.
   The report for Pryor, chairman of the federal services, post
office and civil service subcommittee of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, is the latest blow against FADA, which has been
criticized by members of Congress as both too slow and too
expensive.
   Banking legislation approved by the House Banking Committee
earlier this summer would abolish FADA, forcing the bank board's
insurance fund to reassume the disposition agency's
responsibilities.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said agency
officials believe it will take court or congressional action to
enforce the GAO findings. He contended that if the findings were
enforced, many of the employees would be hired away by big
accounting firms and financial institutions.
   ``We feel its important that we keep and retain these people. To
lose that kind of talent, particularly in the regulatory area,
would be devastating,'' he said.
   Hoyle said about a dozen of the 500 employees in the three
subsidiaries are paid more than the top salary within the federal
civil service.
   Pryor, in a statement released with the report, also complained
that the three subsidiary agencies are exempt from federal conflict
of interest and procurement rules.
   ``Something is drastically wrong. ... We have created a
monstrous bureaucracy with almost no oversight by the Congress,''
he said. These officials ``don't seem to have to comply with
federal conflict of interest laws or federal salary caps. Yet they
have the decision of life or death over hundreds of these
institutions.''

   Shiite Moslem kidnappers freed West
German Hostage Rudolf Cordes Monday, after declaring in a statement
that they were ending his 20-month ordeal in response to Syrian and
Iranian intervention, an official said.
   The official, an aide to Interior Minister Abdullah Rassi, said
the 55-year-old businessman was freed at midnight in west Beirut's
Verdun neighborhood, outside the minister's home.
   The aide demanded anonymity.
   It was not clear why the captors chose to free him there,
despite earlier statements saying he would be released at the
seaside Beaurivage Hotel, close to the command headquarters of the
Syrian army's peacekeeping contingent in west Beirut.
   In their third and final statement delivered Monday, handwritten
in Arabic, the captors threatened to delay the release unless the
ambassadors, Ahmed Dastemeljian of Iran and Wolfgang Gottelmann of
Germany, and an unspecified Syrian official showed up by a 9 p.m.
deadline at the hotel.
   That statement was accompanied by a polaroid photograph of the
captive to prove its authenticity.
   Gottelmann arrived an hour later. After a 20-minute stay at the
hotel, he was whisked away by Syrian escorts and driven in his
bullet-proof Mercedes car to an undisclosed destination.
   Beirut's An-Nahar newspaper on Monday published a letter from
Cordes that it said was delivered to its west Beirut offices at
dawn today along with a statement signed by the Holy Warriors for
Freedom. A second statement signed by the same group was delivered
late Monday afternoon.
   The third and last statement, delivered to a Western news
agency, said Iran and President Hafez Assad of Syria have
guaranteed the problem of Mohammed Ali Hamadi and his brother,
Abbas, who are jailed in West Germany, will be resolved.
   The second statement said the decision to release Cordes ``does
not in any way mean the abandonment of Mujahed (holy warrior)
Mohammed Hamadi.
   ``He remains in our heart and mind. But we will take legal and
judicial ways to release him. If these fail, then we shall be
obliged to again resort to violence,'' the statement said.
   The letter attributed to Cordes said: ``To the government of the
Federal Republic of Germany, I am to be released on Monday.
   ``Please inform my family, but please do everything regarding
Mohammed. Please help. The hostage-takers expect something,
especially now that I am freed.''
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi is being tried in Frankfurt, on murder and
air piracy charges in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner during
which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed. Hamadi has
acknowledged taking part in the hijacking, but says an accomplice
killed Stethem.
   Hamadi's brother, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is believed to head the
Holy Warriors for Freedom, which claimed responsibility for the
Jan. 17, 1987 kidnapping of Cordes, 55, Beirut manager for Hoechst
AG, one of West Germany's largest chemical companies.
   Abdul-Hadi is Beirut chief of the security apparatus of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be
an umbrella group for Shiite factions holding foreign hostages in
Lebanon.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987
after explosives were found in his luggage. Another brother, Abbas,
was convicted by a West German court in April of complicity in the
kidnappings of Cordes and West German engineer Alfred Schmidt in a
bid to free Mohammed.
   Abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Schmidt was released
last September in what the Holy Warriors for Freedom called a
goodwill gesture.
   Seventeen foreigners are missing and believed kidnapped in
Lebanon. The hostage held the longest is Associated Press
correspondent Terry Anderson, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   An earthquake followed by heavy rains

   No casualties were reported in the two-minute temblor that
struck Thursday night near Arua in West Nile province, the
government-run broadcast said. Arua, a rural area 210 miles
northwest of Kampala, is on the western arm of the Great Rift
Valley.
   However, the radio reported some crops and scores of mud hut
homes were destroyed in the two-hour downpour that followed the
earthquake. The station also hard-hit was Pajule, 6 miles west of
Arua and near the Zaire border.
   Radio Uganda did not indicate the severity of the temblor, and

<TEXT>
   Schools, public buildings and
factories closed Monday across Argentina as the 3.5-million-member
organized labor movement held a 24-hour strike.
   The strike, set to end at midnight, was called to protest police
actions at an anti-government rally Friday in front of Government
House in which 113 people, including 37 policemen, were injured.
   Government officials said the police moved in Friday to stop
fighting between rival union groups. Labor leaders denied that and
accused the police of brutality.
   Monday's strike was the 13th organized by the General Labor
Confederation since the elected government of President Raul
Alfonsin was installed in December 1983, ending nearly eight years
of military rule.
   The union federation had rejected a government request to call
off the strike, and Alfonsin's centrist administration pledged over
the weekend to protect anyone who wanted to work Monday.
   No violence was reported.
   Guards were posted at public buildings. Supervisors ran the
subways in Buenos Aires and owners of taxis and inner-city buses
were encouraged to take shifts behind the wheel when most drivers
failed to show up for work.
   The General Labor Confederation, backed by the opposition
Peronist Party, organized last Friday's rally and an 8-hour general
strike to protest Alfonsin's economic policies.
   Inflation registered 440 percent over the last 12 months, with
unemployment and underemployment at a combined 14 percent, near
14-year highs. Real personal incomes have declined for three
straight years.
   The labor federation claims that an anti-inflation plan Alfonsin
implemented last month does not allow workers' wages to keep pace
with increases in the cost of living.

   The pilot of a TWA jetliner
hijacked by Arab terrorists in 1985 testified Monday that Mohammed
Ali Hamadi took pleasure in torturing the passengers and fired the
shot that killed an American sailor.
   Capt. John Testrake, who commanded the plane during the ordeal,
told the court he believed Hamadi was the more violent of two
hijackers who invaded the jetliner's cabin and later killed Robert
Stethem, a U.S. Navy diver.
   But under questioning by defense lawyers, Testrake said he did
not actually see Hamadi pull the trigger.
   In a related development in Lebanon, Shiite Moslem kidnappers
freed West German hostage Rudolf Cordes at midnight Monday after
declaring that they were ending his 20-month ordeal in response to
Syrian and Iranian intervention, a Lebanese government official
said in Beirut.
   A statement purporting to come from Cordes' kidnappers said
earlier that Iran and President Hazef Assad of Syria ``guaranteed''
that the problem of Mohammed Hamadi and his brother, Abbas, also
jailed in West Germany on terrorist charges, will be resolved.
   Abbas Hamadi was convicted of complicity in kidnapping Cordes
and another West German in Beirut to try to force the West German
government to free his younger brother. The other German, Alfred
Schmidt, was released earlier.
   Mohammed Hamadi is charged with murder and air piracy. He has
admitted being one of the hijackers, but has denied killing
Stethem. The Athens-to-Rome flight was hijacked June 14, 1985. It
was flown to Beirut, where Stethem was killed, and 39 Americans
were held hostage for 17 days.
   Testrake testified had testified earlier that either of two
hijackers could have led Stethem to a cabin door where he was shot.
But after a recess, Testrake told the court he had a chance to get
a closer look at Hamadi.
   ``I want to make an important statement,'' Testrake said. ``I
did say before that one of the two (hijackers) appeared to do more
of the communicating and the other more of the violence.''
   He said, ``It appeared that one of the hijackers (Hamadi)
enjoyed beating the passengers more ... to inflict violence.
   ``Looking at this man now, I was struck that ... this is the man
who I recall had stood in the forward entry way and shot Stethem.''
   Asked if both hijackers had dragged Stethem to the doorway,
Testrake said: ``It could have been, but as I said before I am
recalling from memory.''
   ``It was my recollection that the most violent of the two men
was in the companionway. I was in extreme stress and not taking
notes of these details. It's only recollection,'' he added.
   The plane landed in Beirut, was refueled, and flew to Algiers.
It took on fuel and returned to Beirut where Stethem was slain and
39 other passengers were taken off the Boeing 747 and held hostage.
   After the plane landed in Beirut the second time, Testrake told
the court, one of the hijackers talked to the airport tower in
Arabic.
   ``I could tell the hijacker was becoming more and more agitated.
He began screaming into the radio. At this time he turned toward
his accomplice and screamed what appeared to be an order,'' the
pilot said.
   ``The forward cabin door was open. I saw the other hijacker push
Stethem out the doorway. Then I heard a single shot,'' Testrake
told the court.
   After Testrake finished his testimony, the judge asked Hamadi if
he had anything to say. He replied through an interpreter: ``There
are some things that are being lied about here.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in 1987 after
explosives were found in his luggage.
   Testrake said he first realized there was trouble aboard Flight
847 when he heard banging noises from behind the cockpit door
shortly after the plane took off from Athens. ``There was knocking
and also strong kicking at the door.''
   He said the co-pilot looked through a peephole in the cockpit
door and exclaimed: ``We have been hijacked.'' Testrake said
co-pilot Philip Maresca of Salt Lake City saw a man brandishing ``a
chrome-plated pistol.''
   ``At that moment, our purser called over the intercom and said
they (the passengers) were being mishandled. Not wishing them to be
mishandled, I directed my flight engineer to open the door,'' the
pilot testified.
   He said the men burst into the cockpit armed with the pistol and
two hand grenades. Testrake said he was not beaten, but that his
flight engineer, Benjamin C. Zimmermann, of Cascade, Idaho, was
repeatedly struck with the pistol on the head and shoulders.
   ``Blood was coming from his head and from his shirt,'' said
Testrake.
   He said the hijackers continued to beat the engineer and
passengers even after the hijackers' demands to fly to Beirut were
met.
   ``There was no reason for any of the beating because we were
complying with their demands,'' Testrake told the court.
   The pilot, who lives in Richmond, Mo., said he believed the men
had been trained well for the mission and that they were familiar
with the cockpit.
   Last week, two former hostages also told the court that the
hijackers, including Hamadi, brutally beat passengers before
Stethem was killed.
   American Kurt Carlson, testified that he believed Hamadi was the
leader of the hijackers because ``he was giving the orders.''
Carlson testified that he was also beaten by the hijackers.

<HEAD>Mortar Shells Fired at Parliament Building</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three mortar shells were fired Monday at
the parliament building, deepening the crisis caused by the
stalemate among Christians, Moslems and leftists in selecting a new
president.
   Hours later, House Speaker Hussein Husseini announced that
legislators would be summoned to meet Sept. 22 for another attempt
to elect a successor to Christian President Amin Gemayel.
   Police said there were no casualties from three 60mm mortar
shells that exploded at 6:45 a.m. around the two-story parliament
building, known as Villa Mansour. The building is in the no-man's
land between predominantly Moslem west Beirut and Christian east
Beirut.
   It was the first attack on Villa Mansour in two years.
   Police said one shell hit the entrance of Villa Mansour and the
other two exploded near army and police checkpoints guarding
approaches to the building.
   They said no group claimed responsibility and they did not know
if the attack was linked to the electoral deadlock.
   Right-wing Christians and Moslem and leftist factions backed by
Syria quickly blamed the others for the shelling.
   Legislators had met Aug. 18 in an attempt to elect a successor
to Gemayel, whose six-year term expires Sept. 23, but some
Christians boycotted the session and there was not a quorum,
meaning the selection could not proceed.
   Under the constitution, the president cannot seek a second
consecutive term.
   The boycotting Christians opposed the main candidate,
Syrian-backed former President Suleiman Franjieh, a Maronite
Christian.
   By tradition, Lebanon's president is a Christian, the prime
minister a Sunni Moslem and the speaker of the House a Shiite
Moslem.
   Failure to elect a new president would leave a political vacuum
that many fear could reignite the civil war that has been mostly
dormant for 18 months.
   It could not be determined if Husseini's announcement of a new
electoral session indicated an agreement between Moslems and
Christians on a consensus candidate.
   Husseini said the Sept. 22 session will be held in the old
parliament building, in the Moslem sector's battle-scarred Place de
l'Etoile.
   Legislators have used Villa Mansour for parliamentary sessions
since they were forced out of the Place de l'Etoile in 1976, in the
early days of the civil war.
   Husseini did not say if he changed the venue for the session
because of Monday's mortar attack.
   The Syrians continue to support Franjieh, 78, president from
1970 to 1976.
   Raymond Edde, a Maronite Christian who has been living in
self-imposed exile in Paris since 1976, announced his candidacy
shortly after Husseini set the date for the new session.
   Parliament Secretary Ihsan Abu Khalil said Edde announced his
candidacy in a telephone call to Husseini from Paris.
   Edde, 73, fled to France after three assassination attempts
against him.
   He has been the front-runner among the two dozen presidential
aspirants, including Franjieh, in recent public opinion polls.
   Rightist Christians claim that Franjieh would turn Lebanon into
a Syrian satellite.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000
military personnel in eastern and northern provinces and west and
south Beirut.
   Franjieh's Moslem and leftist backers say the United States and
Israel prevented his election because he advocates an unconditional
withdrawal by the Israelis from their self-designated ``security
zone'' in southern Lebanon.
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and established the buffer zone
after withdrawing most of its army in 1985.

<HEAD>Panel Urges EPA to Focus on Preventing Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency must focus
on preventing pollution instead of concentrating on cleaning up
existing problems with an ``end of pipe'' strategy, a report
provided Monday recommended.
   To help carry through such a change, the agency's research
budget should be increased by about $375 million a year _ roughly
doubled _ said a committee of the agency's Science Advisory Board
in the report.
   The study was made available by agency officials Monday after an
article about it appeared in The Boston Globe.
   The committee was responding to a request for advice from EPA
Administrator Lee M. Thomas, who, the report said, ``sensed that
EPA's immediate regulatory needs were driving its research and
development efforts, while longer-term research equally important
to achieving EPA's overall risk reduction goals was being
neglected.''
   Al Alm, former deputy administrator of EPA and chairman of the
high-level advisory committee, said in an interview that Thomas was
correct.
   ``The problem EPA has is it's spending most of its R&D dollars
just putting out legislative fires,'' Alm said, referring to
research and development money. ``One of its major problems is to
look ahead, to anticipate problems.''
   ``Obviously you need technical support for the regulations (but)
... that has driven virtually all the long-term research away,'' he
said.
   The report said that in the 1970s, efforts to control
automobile, industrial and wastewater pollution using ``federally
mandated end-of-pipe controls were sensible, targeted, relatively
efficient and reasonably cost effective.''
   Though cleanups have been predicated on the notion that ``the
polluter pays,'' and those controls will still be important,
strategy must change, the report argued.
   ``For one thing, we are discovering environmental contamination
in our homes _ e.g., radon _ and in the statosphere _ e.g.,
chlorofluorocarbons _ that are not emitted by `pipes' in the
traditional sense,'' the report said.
   For another thing, end-of-pipe control has too often shifted
pollution from one place to another, for example, from water to air
for toxic pollutants removed from sewage streams by aeration
techniques.
   ``Whenever possible, environmental protection efforts first
should be aimed at minimizing the amount of wastes or pollutants
generated. Thus waste reduction at its source _ for example,
through product design changes, industrial process changes or
material substitution _ should be a primary objective,'' the report
said.
   Alm said he believed many businesses would welcome a vigorous
program of ``technology transfer'' led by EPA _ a program to show
them how their processes could be changed to generate less waste.
   ``The private sector has ... an incentive through liability
questions,'' Alm said.
   To help keep the need for long-term research in view, EPA should
convert the position of assistant administrator for research and
development from a presidential appointment to a career job, the
report argued.
   In the 18 years for EPA's existence, no one has held the job for
more than three years, and ``no leader ... has stayed at the agency
long enough to implement a sustained, long-term research
strategy,'' it said.
   Ecological research should get more emphasis, having taken a
back seat to research to support regulations aimed at protecting
human health, the report said.

   An American engineer who was kidnapped in
Lebanon overpowered his captors and escaped to Damascus on Monday
with the help of Syrian troops, Lebanon radio and U.S. officials
said.
   A source close to the Foreign Ministry confirmed the American
was delivered to the U.S. Embassy, but he said the engineer was
rescued by Syrian troops who found where he was being held in
Lebanon and overpowered the kidnappers.
   The discrepencies in the reports could not immediately be
reconciled.
   All three reports said the engineer was abducted Sunday by
unidentified gunmen in east Lebanon after he married a Lebanese
woman.
   The U.S. Embassy in Damascus refused to comment on the story,
but officials in Washington identified the engineer as Kenneth
Wells and said he works in Saudi Arabia for Litton Industries.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wells
was taken captive in Lebanon as he was leaving his wedding
reception. They said his Lebanese bride was detained briefly.
   Wells subdued his abductors after several hours, reached a
Syrian army checkpoint and was escorted to Damascus, where he was
turned over to a U.S. Embassy official, the officials in Washington
said.
   The officials said Wells' mother reportedly lives in Tennessee.
According to one published report, Wells is 25 and his wife, Samia,
is 32. He is said to hold a black belt in karate.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, who confirmed much of
the account of Wells' experience, expressed gratitude to Syrian
authorities for their assistance. He said the episode underscores
the dangers American citizens face in Lebanon, where nine Americans
are held hostage.
   The Voice of Lebanon, which is run by right-wing Christian
militias, said the bridegroom ``who excels in karate'' subdued
three gunmen, who were armed with automatic rifles, disarmed them
and took refuge at a Syrian army post. The Syrians then drove him
to Damascus, the radio said. The gunmen intercepted the newlyweds a
few hours after the wedding, the radio said.
   The Syrian source, who also demanded anonymity, said Wells
traveled to Lebanon and married Nadia Haydar Sharafeddine, a girl,
whose family lives in Baalbek. He said Wells was kidnapped after
the wedding near his bride's home.
   After a long search, Syrian troops located the couple, freed
them from the gunmen and took them to Damascus, where Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa turned them over to U.S. Charge
d'Affaires John Craig, the source said.
   The Sharafeddines are a well-known Shiite Moslem family in
Baalbek, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is an extremist Shiite group that is
believed to be an umbrella for various factions holding 18 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   The hostage held the longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Army Suspends Deliveries of 9mm Baretta Due to Slide Mechanism
Cracking</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 13th graf to correct Colt .45 to pistol sted of revolver</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army and Italian gunmaker Beretta have
reached an agreement to suspend deliveries of the military's new
9mm pistol for the next three months to deal with a problem of
unexpected cracking in the gun's slide mechanism, the service said
Monday.
   The latest halt to deliveries _ the second in nine months _ will
last from September through December, said Lt. Col. John Reitz, an
Army spokesman. By January, the Army expects Beretta to resume
production and deliveries of the 9mm pistol after making
modifications to the slide mechanism.
   The delay in deliveries was worked out during a meeting Aug. 17
between Army and Beretta officials, with the company accepting the
move ``at no cost to the government,'' the spokesman said.
   The Army insisted on changes to the weapon's manufacture after
an incident in July in which a pistol slide cracked unexpectedly
during training firings and sent fragments back toward the
shooter's chest. It was the fourth such cracking incident over the
past year.
   Beretta and the Army have now agreed the metal pistol slides for
the gun will have to be forged using an improved heat process to
ensure their strength and the guns fitted with a device to capture
any slide that does crack.
   ``It was agreed that August production quantities would be
accepted without the modified slide and components, pending formal
approval of the engineering change proposal,'' said Reitz.
``Deliveries with the new slide mechanism will resume in January
1989.''
   The spokesman said Beretta also had agreed to retrofit the
pistols already delivered with the new mechanisms after completing
its production run.
   The company has so far delivered more than 140,000 pistols of an
order for 316,000.
   The Army first stopped accepting deliveries of the handgun last
November because of an unexpected cracking problem with the
pistol's frame. Beretta USA, a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker
Armi Beretta SpA, subsequently devised a manufacturing solution to
that problem earlier this year and resumed production.
   In the meantime, though, the Army had started investigating why
slide bolts on the Berettas were cracking. The first such incident
occurred late last year.
   The latest decision to halt deliveries was reported Monday by
the trade publication ``Defense Week'' and subsequently confirmed
by Army officials.
   The Washington office of Beretta declined immediate comment on
the matter.
   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,
Md., beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide
9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45-caliber
pistol. The Army, which has designated the pistol the M-9, is
serving as the executive buying agent for all the services and
awarded Beretta an initial contract worth $75 million.
   The latest problems arise at a time when Beretta has entered a
congressionally ordered competition with the Massachusetts gunmaker
Smith & Wesson and several other interested American gunmakers to
supply the next batch of 9mm pistols.
   The American firms had protested the 1985 award to a foreign
company.
   The slide bolt on the Beretta is thrown backward after a shot is
fired as part of the process of chambering a new round. Army
officials disclosed last May that Beretta had blamed the slide
failures on the use of special ammunition, but that the Army was
not prepared to accept that explanation.

Centerville.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the Ohio Valley,
the Tennessee Valley, the lower Mississippi Valley, the western
Gulf Coast and Florida.
   A possible tornado caused some damage near a shopping mall on
the west side of Indianapolis during the afternoon. No injuries
were reported, police said.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered over New Mexico,
eastern Colorado, northern Arizona and south-central Nebraska.
   In the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 2.14 inches of rain fell at
Huntsville, Ala., with 1.93 inches at Chicago's O'Hare airport.
   Missoula, Mont., posted a record low Monday of 28 degrees, and
Pocatello, Idaho, tied its low temperature record for the date of
30.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36

   Edd Bailey, who worked his way from carman's
helper to president of the Union Pacific Railroad, has died. He was
83.
   Bailey died Sunday in Cheyenne, Wyo.
   Bailey became president of the Omaha-based railroad in 1965 and
retired in 1971. He served on the board of directors of the parent
Union Pacific Corp. until 1974.
   Bailey was born in Elmo, Mo., the eldest of 12 children.
   At 18, Bailey took a job as a helper in the railroad's
car-repair shop in Cheyenne at 38 cents an hour in 1922.
   He later worked as a freight yard blacksmith, loaded mail cars
and served as a brakeman, conductor, special police agent and
trainmaster.
   By 1945, Bailey had become superintendent of the railroad's
Nebraska and Wyoming divisions. He was appointed vice president in
charge of operations in 1957 and seven years later became the
executive officer of the railroad's transportation division. The
next year he was named president of the railroad.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Hugh Hefner, founder, chairman and chief
executive officer of Playboy Enterprises, announced Monday he won't
run for re-election to the company's board of directors and is
passing full command to his daughter.
   The company said in a statement that Christie Hefner is expected
to be elected to the posts her father holds at a board meeting Nov.
10, set to follow Playboy's 1988 shareholders meeting.
   Ms. Hefner, 35, now is the company's president, chief operating
officer and vice chairwoman.
   ``I think in terms of the company overall _ it is a changing of
the guard, a sort of passing the reins along,'' said Playboy
spokeswoman Robyn Radomski. ``In terms of where the company is now,
it's a logical step. ... But Hef is still going to be
editor-in-chief of the magazine and be involved in major strategic
decisions.''
   Once Ms. Hefner becomes Playboy's top board executive, the
company's 62-year-old founder will hold the titles of chairman
emeritus and editor-in-chief of Playboy magazine, the company said.
   ``Christie has had my full support since she took responsibility
for the day-to-day operations of the company in April of 1982,''
Hefner said in a statement. ``During this period, she has directed
a restructuring program that has resulted in an overall return to
profitability.
   ``This change is just another evolutionary step consistent with
my own personal plans, but I do not intend to reduce my commitment
of time and effort to the success of the company,'' said Hefner,
who mortgaged his furniture and invested $600 to publish the first
issue of Playboy in December 1953.
   Hefner, Playboy's major stockholder, is working on his
autobiography, for which the company said it will receive ``a
substantial seven-figure advance'' from Bantam Books Inc.
   Ms. Hefner said in a statement that she would help to ``continue
to build the Playboy franchise by expanding our licensing and
television and video buinesses.''
   ``The geographic reach of the company also will continue to be
expanded, with new markets such as India and Eastern Bloc countries
opening up for Playboy-licensed products, and foreign distribution
of home video and television programs growing,'' she said.
   Under Ms. Hefner's leadership, Playboy Enterprises closed the
last of its U.S. key clubs and shed its interests in movie
theaters, modeling and book and record clubs. Playboy Enterprises
made a $2.6 million profit in 1988.
   Dan Lee, an anaylst with Drexel Burnahm Lambert Inc. in New
York, said Hefner may have wanted to spend less time on business
because of his plans to marry Kimberley Conrad, 26, Playmate of the
Month for January, sometime next year. Hefner has been single since
his divorce in 1952.
   ``In a business sense, Christie Hefner has largely been running
the company for the past several years,'' Lee said. ``But he owns
about 80 percent of Playboy's stock, so there won't be any dramatic
changes.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, trying to
counter Republican attacks on his defense views, made an unusual
pledge of support Monday for the Stealth bomber but ran into boos
from workers at a plant where engines for the airplane are
manufactured.
   A Dukakis adviser said afterward he believed there was no
difference between his position and that of GOP rival George Bush
on the bomber.
   Dukakis visited the large General Electric plant outside
Cincinnati after a stop in Philadelphia where he charged that Bush
was ``unforgivably wrong'' in the Iran-Contra affair and questioned
whether his opponent has ``the steadiness required in the Oval
Office.''
   Beginning a campaign week devoted largely to defense and foreign
policy matters, Dukakis got cheers but also boos and chants of
``Bush, Bush'' from some in the crowd of 1,000 when he spoke inside
the GE plant. He stood in front of military and commercial jet
engines and referred to the Stealth bomber, the radar-evading
aircraft that has been shrouded in secrecy during planning and
early stages of production.
   ``That bomber was started by a Democratic administration; it was
supported by the Democrats in Congress, and it's going to be
completed under my administration,'' said Dukakis, who was
accompanied by Ohio Sen. John Glenn.
   Dukakis' speech was not interrupted by the protesters, thanks in
part to a booming amplification system that allowed him to speak
easily over the shouts.
   Many supporters in the crowd chanted ``Duke, Duke'' to help
drown out the dissenters. Those booing were in a minority.
   Dukakis' unqualified statement of support for the Stealth bomber
appeared to go beyond earlier campaign statements that he supported
continued research of the project. Dukakis issues adviser James
Steinberg said Dukakis was committed to deployment of the aircraft
provided ``it is affordable and it works,'' and said that did not
represent a change in position.
   ``He says we need it and he intends to deploy it,'' Steinberg
said. He asserted ``I don't believe there's a difference'' between
the positions of Bush and Dukakis on the Stealth.
   Earlier in Philadelphia, Dukakis said that as vice president
Bush had produced only failure in combating drugs, cracking down on
international terrorism and dealing with the imbalance in foreign
trade.
   ``In each of these three areas, George Bush has failed,''
Dukakis said. ``No wonder he doesn't want to debate.''
   Bush's representatives agreed to a tentative schedule for two
debates in recent days, half the four meetings Dukakis had sought.
   The Democratic presidential candidate delivered the first of
what is to be three defense and national security addresses this
week to an invited audience of 200 union members and other
supporters in Philadelphia.
   Dukakis has been stung by weeks of criticism from Bush and the
Republicans, who have painted him as weak on defense issues and in
opposition to a range of new weapons systems, including virtually
all proposals for new land-based nuclear weapons. Press secretary
Dayton Duncan said Dukakis' visit to the GE plant was aimed at
showing that Dukakis ``is for the Stealth bomber, despite what his
opponent has said.''
   In his Philadelphia speech, Dukakis continued the tougher, more
aggressive stance against Bush that he first displayed last week in
Texas, although he provided few new specifics about his own
national security views.
   He sharpened his now-familiar attack on Bush for keeping silent
when President Reagan agreed to sell missiles to Iran in exchange
for the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I don't question George Bush's patriotism, even though these
days he seems to be questioning mine,'' Dukakis said. ``Not for a
minute. But does this man, a man who would encourage the president
of the United States to undermine American interests and prestige
by selling arms to Iran have the judgment and the steadiness
required in the Oval Office?''
   The reference to patriotism was a response to Bush's repeated
digs at Dukakis for vetoing a state bill aimed to requiring public
school teachers to lead their classes in reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance. Dukakis says he was advised the bill was
unconstitutional.
   But Dukakis bungled the patriotism line Monday, saying: ``I
don't question George Bush's terrorism.'' He quickly corrected
himself.
   Dukakis focused his criticism of Bush on three areas he said
were crucial to national security, and heaped scorn on Dan Quayle,
the GOP vice presidential candidate, as unqualifed to oversee the
government's anti-drug efforts as Bush had.
   ``I want to beat our foreign competitors; he (Bush) is willing
to settle for second place,'' Dukakis said. ``I want to crack down
on terrorism; he knuckled under to the Ayatollah. I want a real war
against drugs; his answer to drug kingpins like (Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio) Noriega is J. Danforth Quayle.''
   Dukakis questioned why the Reagan administration proposed sharp
cuts in federal aid to state and local drug agencies while imports
of illicit narcotics were soaring.
   He demanded that Bush explain why the government had friendly
dealings with Noriega, despite allegations the Panamanian leader
was involved in drug trafficking, and accused the administration of
``blocking a congressional investigation into when and why and how
much we paid Noriega.''
   Quayle, campaigning in Michigan, said Dukakis ``obviously
doesn't know what he's talking about.'' He said the Democrat
``quite obviously doesn't believe that tough law enforcement
provides a deterrent,'' and he reiterated the ticket's call for the
death penalty for drug ``kingpins.''

<HEAD>Mayor Says He Won't Run For Fifth Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Henry Cisneros, a leading
Hispanic politician who once was considered a potential vice
presidential candidate, said Monday he's been in public service
long enough and won't seek a fifth term.
   ``It's been work and it's been fun. Mostly, it's been the most
engrossing and fulfilling thing I've ever done,'' said Cisneros,
41, whose term expires next spring.
   ``Basically, I've been at it for 14 years _ eight years as mayor
and six as council member. That's a long time to go at full
throttle,'' he said. ``Our country believes that eight years in a
high office should be enough to get a job done.
   ``Presidents serve eight years. Governors serve eight years. And
eight years is a good round number for a mayor, especially this
one,'' he said.
   Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale interviewed
Cisneros in 1984 about possibly running on his ticket. Cisneros
also has been mentioned frequently as a possible Cabinet-level
appointee.
   Last year, Cisneros said he would not seek a statewide office
because he wanted to devote time to San Antonio projects and to his
son, John Paul Anthony, who was born with a congenital heart defect
and with stomach abnormalities.
   Earlier this year, Cisneros, a former president of the National
League of Cities, turned down an offer to make a keynote address to
the Democratic National Convention.
   Cisneros, who has met Pope John Paul II and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, was approached earlier this year by several San
Antonio businessmen about the prospect of forming a firm to handle
business investments.
   The mayor's salary is less than $5,000 and Cisneros, with two
adolescent daughters and an ill infant, had supplemented that
income with lectures, columns and speaking engagements.
   Cisneros said he needs a different job because his two daughters
are approaching college age and because the medical expenses for
his son are sure to increase.
   ``Today is a little sad for me. It has to be,'' Cisneros said.
``But I expect to wake up tomorrow morning, ready to make the most
of the next eight months, same pace, same energy, same devotion to
the city until midnight of the day before the next mayor takes
office.''
   During his tenure, the bilingual, charismatic mayor helped
attract numerous conventions and businesses to the city, including
Sea World of Texas, the largest marine life theme park in the world.
   Cisneros, who won his last two elections overwhelmingly, also
helped attract numerous Hispanics to the polls, said Bob
Brischetto, executive director of the Southwest Voter Research
Institute.
   ``He certainly has the charisma to turn out the Hispanic vote,
and I think the city contest without him is going to be a different
contest,'' he said.

   Africa is facing huge debts, lagging food
production and a soaring infant mortality rate despite broad
economic and social reforms, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said Monday.
   The U.N. chief, speaking at the opening of a two-week review of
the U.N. Africa Recovery Program, gave a grim prognosis for the
continent.
   Among the signs of distress he cited:
   _Infant and child mortality rates are rising, and are projected
to reach 50 million in the period 1985-2000. In every other world
region, infant and child mortality is rapidly decreasing.
   _By the year 2010, Africa's debt will be more than 280 percent
of its total export income.
   _Per capita income on the continent fell 2 percent in 1986 and
2.2 percent in 1987, and today is lower than it was in 1980.
   _Agricultural production improved by 3.8 percent in 1986 but
only 1.1 percent in 1987, despite agricultural policy reforms.
   Perez de Cuellar's report marks the midway point of the
1986-1990 Africa Recovery Program, the result of a special General
Assembly session in May 1986, the first such session to focus on
one continent.
   The program was aimed at helping reverse Africa's economic
decline, but external problems have blocked substantial progress,
Perez de Cuellar said.
   He said three key problems are Africa's depressed export
earnings, the cost of repaying its debt and insufficient financing.
   ``Every day that passes, the debt burden of African countries
becomes even more excruciating,'' said Adebayo Adedeji, U.N.
undersecretary-general.
   Although Africa paid almost $1 billion a year to the
International Monetary Fund in loan costs in 1986 and 1987,
resources fell, exports credit declined and loans from the private
sector were minor, the U.N. chief's report said.
   Africa's debt burden ``has become one of the most important
factors constraining recovery and development on the continent, and
unless urgent action is taken, the situation will worse,'' said
Perez de Cuellar.
   Africa's total external debt is estimated by the U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa at $218 billion by the end of 1987, almost
triple the continent's export earnings.
   A slump in commodity prices has further hurt Africa's economy.
Particulary damaging are the sluggish markets for oil, minerals,
cocoa, coffee, and tea.
   These problems largely canceled out any gain that might have
been produced by the ``courageous and commendable'' sacrifices of
some African governments, such as adopting steep currency
devaluations, cutting budget deficits and an turning over some
public sector functions to the private sector.
   ``In many countries such measures involve social costs and
political risks,'' Perez de Cuellar noted.
   Most African nations have embarked on economic restructuring
programs, about 30 percent of them with the backing of the IMF and
World Bank.
   ``Most countries are giving greater priority to channeling
resources to agriculture, to improving incentives for farmers, to
making provision for food security and to combating drought and
decertification,'' the secretary-general said.
   Perez de Cuellar urged African nations to continue these
restructuring programs, but cautioned them to ensure that ``the
most vulnerable groups in society are protected from adverse
consequences.''
   Donor countries should show their support for these reforms by
increasing their aid, he said.
   Perez de Cuellar called on industrialized nations to reduce
their agricultural subsidies on products competing with African
commodities.
   ``African efforts to pursue and deepen the reform process cannot
be sustained indefinitely in the face of an adverse external
environment and without increased support from the international
community,'' the secretary-general said.

<HEAD>Iran's Parliament Approves 18 Ministers, Rejects Three</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Parliament approved 18 ministers
Monday in a vote of confidence for Prime Minister Hussein Musavi's
government, but rejected three, including Revolutionary Guards
Minister Mohsen Rafiqdoust, Tehran Radio said.
   The two-day debate exposed the deep divisions in the Tehran
hierarchy that had largely been masked by the need for unity during
the 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   The veto on Rafiqdoust underscored the anger over disastrous
battlefield defeats suffered by Iran before it abruptly accepted a
year-old United Nations-sponsored cease-fire July 18. These
setbacks had been blamed on the Revolutionary Guards.
   Iran and Iraq began observing a truce Aug. 20 and started
U.N.-mediated peace talks in Geneva five days later.
   The parliamentary debate, which Musavi announced in July, opened
Sunday amid a deepening rift between hardline revolutionaries
demanding economic isolationism and tight state control of the
economy and rivals, such as House Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
seek to open up oil-rich Iran in the postwar era.
   Several deputies attacked hardliner Musavi's economic policies,
while radical legislators loyal to the premier defended his
administration.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, gave few details of Monday's
session.
   But the radio said the 11 ministers of the 21-member Cabinet who
were cross-examined by the 270-member Majlis, or parliament,
included Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, Oil Minister
Alireza Aqazadeh, Heavy Industry Minister Behzad Nabavi and
Rafiqdoust.
   Besides Rafiqdoust, Education and Training Minister Kazem Akrami
and Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Abbas Zali also
received a no-confidence vote.
   Musavi will have to choose three new ministers to replace them.
   The fact that other close allies of Musavi won the vote of
confidence indicated that a head-on clash between radicals and
conservatives over Iran's postwar economic policy has been averted,
at least for now.
   Musavi, prime minister for seven years, warned Sunday that a
vote of no confidence in his Cabinet would seriously hamper Iran's
postwar recovery.
   Musavi, 46, submitted his resignation to President Ali Khamenei
on Sept. 5, saying he believed at least eight of his ministers
faced no-confidence votes.
   Khamenei rejected the resignation and Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch, publicly rebuked
Musavi for making the surprise move at such a critical juncture
while Iran was negotiating a peace settlement with Iraq.
   Musavi retracted his resignation, but complained of
``difficulties in the decision-making process in the executive,''
an apparent sideswipe at his rivals, Khamenei and Rafsanjani.
   Khomeini's intervention put off any major political crisis in
Iran. But analysts believe the end of the war will bring profound
changes in Iran and that Musavi could be among the political
casualties.
   Musavi reportedly opposed a truce. He opposes allowing foreign
multinationals back into Iran to help with the massive task of
reconstruction. Rafsanjani and Khamenei favor a more moderate
course and ending Iran's self-imposed isolation.
   Khamenei on Monday opened Tehran's 14th international trade
fair, in which 36 countries were participating.
   Some, like France, were taking part for the first time since the
1979 Islamic revolution toppled the late, pro-Western Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Cyprus, said other foreign participants included the Soviet Union,
Argentina, Australia, Switzerland, West Germany, Ireland, Sweden,
Japan and South Korea.
   IRNA quoted Commerce Minister Abdulhussein Vahaji as stressing
that Iran welcomes foreign technological assistance for
reconstruction projects and said Iran now seeks to expand
commercial links with the rest of the world.
   Some Western analysts have estimated that Iran's postwar
reconstruction could cost $40 billion.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Runs Into Complaints From Crowd</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his first public
appearance after a six-week vacation, ran into crowds complaining
loudly about food shortages and living conditions Monday in the
Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk.
   The evening television news program ``Vremya'' led its evening
program with a report on the Kremlin leader's trip to the city,
about 2,000 miles east of Moscow.
   Gorbachev had been out of public view since July 30, when he met
with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany.
Soviet officials said he was on vacation.
   Gorbachev asked for support for his reform policies as residents
of Krasnoyarsk pressed close to him and complained about lack of
hot water and long lines for meat, sausage and other foods.
   The clamor was in marked contrast to the usual orderly scenes of
Gorbachev visits on Soviet TV. Many of the comments and complaints
were inaudible.
   ``The most important thing is that you believe in our politics
and in the leadership that is still being formed. It's still being
formed at the regional and provincial levels,'' Gorbachev said.
   He told the residents he was not interested in blind faith, but
in reasoned trust for his policies and the people implementing them.
   ``We're on the right path, comrades,'' he said. ``No need to get
lost. We're on the right path.''
   The Soviet leader blamed both local and national officials for
failing to develop social services in Krasnoyarsk, and reiterated
that he is committed to providing each Soviet family with a
separate apartment by the year 2000.
   Gorbachev arrived in Krasnoyarsk on a special Aeroflot plane and
met with residents near the airport, and again near the city's
central square, where he laid a wreath at a monument to Soviet
founder Vladimir I. Lenin.
   He defended his tolerance of greater debate and criticism in the
Soviet press and encouragement of cooperatives outside the
state-run economy.
   One woman complained that cooperatives, owned by the people who
run them rather than by the government, charge too much for their
services.
   Gorbachev agreed that cooperative prices are high, but told the
woman that as more co-ops are formed competition will drive prices
down.
   Gorbachev has encouraged cooperatives to provide goods and
services that are in short supply in the state-run economy.
   A man complained that under his policy of glasnost, or greater
openness, the state-run press is free to attack anyone by name,
whether they deserve it or not.
   The Soviet leader responded, ``We need openness, we need
glasnost, but it has to be according to our values, according to
socialism and according to people.''
   No indication emerged how long Gorbachev would remain in
Krasnoyarsk, the regional center for an area that takes in
one-tenth of the entire Soviet Union.
   Krasnoyarsk also is the site of a Soviet radar station that the
United States says is an obstacle to arms control negotiations.
Gorbachev did not discuss the radar site in comments distributed by
the Tass news agency and shown on Soviet television.

   A United Airlines DC-10 broke a nose wheel on
landing at Stapleton International Airport on Monday and skidded
between two runways, and at least one passenger suffered a minor
injury as he was evacuated, an airport spokesman said.
   Norm Avery said the incident occurred shortly before 2 p.m., and
that the plane was still between two runways after passengers were
taken off via escape chutes.
   The plane was flight 225, which originated at Hartford, Conn.,
and made a stop in Chicago before landing at Stapleton.
   Witnesses who said they saw the plane land told KCNC-Channel 4
that the craft came in with its nose high, and that the wheel
collapsed as the nose moved down at a landing angle.
   One passenger injured an ankle while sliding down the chute,
Avery said.
   ``The plane carried 197 passengers and 10 crew members,'' said
Sarah Dornacker, media relations manager for United at its Chicago
offices.
   ``All passengers were safely evacuated after the plane left the
side of the runway,'' she said.
   Skies were overcast and the runways were wet, but the weather
was not believed to be a factor in the accident, Dornacker said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet observers came to
this Central Asian city Monday to prepare for the first Soviet
nuclear test monitored by American experts, a step toward ratifying
two long-pending arms treaties.
   Arms negotiator C. Paul Robinson, who heads the American
delegation, said it had been ``a long journey, but an even longer
journey in the mind'' to reach the point at which the two
superpowers are willing to share some of their most closely guarded
technology in the interest of arms control.
   Robinson spoke before setting off by bus across the steppe to
the Soviet test ground.
   An American team of up to 40 specialists has worked at the site
since April, drilling a hole 2,100 feet into the earth to plant a
measuring device the U.S. government calls the most sensitive gauge
of nuclear explosions.
   A test blast, to be detonated Wednesday, is similar to one
exploded at the U.S. test site on Pahute Mesa, Nev., on Aug. 17.
The devices are being set off to allow each side use its own
testing equipment and compare the results with those of the other
side to determine the strength of the blast and the accuracy of the
monitoring techniques.
   The joint experiments are expected to lead to U.S. Senate
ratification of two long-dormant treaties limiting underground
nuclear explosions to 150 kilotons, still many times more powerful
than the bomb that devasted Hiroshima, Japan.
   A kiloton is the equivalent of the explosion of 1,000 tons of
TNT.
   Those pacts _ the Threshold Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and
a similar accord signed in 1976 to limit peaceful nuclear
explosions _ were bypassed by President Jimmy Carter, who pressed
instead for a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing.
   His successor, Ronald Reagan, shelved the unratified documents,
claiming the Soviets regularly violated their limits without
permitting on-site verification.
   The Soviet Union unsuccessfully sought for 18 months to cajole
the United States into joining a Soviet moratorium on all nuclear
tests. It abandoned the effort last February and agreed to go along
with joint verification of tests as a step toward its goal of a
total ban.
   ``No one thought even a year ago that what is about to happen
could happen,'' Robinson said Monday. He called the joint
verification experiment ``a real triumph of confidence-building''
on both sides.
   Detailed results of last month's test have not yet been
released. But U.S. officials, speaking on condition they not be
identified, have expressed considerable satisfaction with the
results.
   Reports have surfaced that the U.S. measuring gear, which the
United States contends is more accurate than Soviet methods, showed
that the American test exceeded the 150-kiloton limit.
   But officials said Monday they regarded that possibility as
``very, very unlikely,'' noting that even with its much-heralded
accuracy the U.S. measuring device can be 30 percent off.

   An Ecuadorean domestic airliner crashed
Monday shortly after taking off from a jungle airport, killing all
seven crew members, the Civil Aviation press office said.
   The agency said the craft, belonging to the domestic airline
TAME, was carrying no passengers when it took off from an airstrip
at Lago Agrio, an oil town in Ecuador's Amazon jungle, 105 miles
northeast of Quito.
   The plane crashed at 2:29 p.m. (3:29 p.m. EDT) and the dead
included three flight attendants, the press office said.
   A press statement said the plane, an Electra with capacity for
97 passengers, was still low in the air when it tipped sideways,
plunged to the ground and burst into flames.
   The plane's destination was Quito, according to the Civil
Aviation office. TAME, a military-run commercial airline, serves
cities within Ecuador.
   It was the second air crash in less than a week in Ecuador. Last
Thursday a bimotor plane slammed into shrimp ponds on Ecuador's
Pacific coast, killing all 10 people aboard.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded seven
Palestinians in clashes Monday, hospital officials said. The army
bolstered security throughout the occupied lands to head off
violence during the two-day Jewish New Year.
   In Hebron on the West Bank, merchants said they would set up a
militia of about 25 Palestinian guards to replace the city's
Palestinian police officers, most of whom quit on orders from
underground uprising leaders, municipal secretary Hathem Bakri
reported.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, troop gunfire hit three
Palestinian teen-agers, including a 14-year-old boy who was
seriously wounded in the abdomen, acording to hospital officials.
   In the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya and Shati refugee camps, troops
fired on stone-throwing youths, wounding four, other hospital
officials reported.
   The army confirmed one casualty and said it was checking the
others.
   Elsewhere, youths blockaded streets in Gaza City, set tires
ablaze and hurled stones at Israeli settlers' cars, witnesses said.
   At least 264 Palestinians and six Israelis have died since
violence began on Dec. 8 in lands Israel seized from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war.
   The army freed 75 Palestinians jailed without trial in a Negev
desert prison camp. An army spokesman said it was a humanitarian
gesture on the occasion of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
   That brought to 150 the number of Palestinians freed over the
holiday, which began at sundown Sunday and lasts through sundown
Tuesday.
   About 2,500 Palestinians are jailed without trial at the desert
tent prison at Ketziot, about five miles from the Egyptian border.
   Bakri said Hebron's new Palestinian guard was the first of its
kind to be set up in the occupied territories and would be financed
by Hebron business people, many of whom suffered break-ins after
most city policemen resigned.
   ``The purpose is to guard markets and businesses because there
have been a lot of robberies, costing merchants hundreds of
thousands of dollars. We need such a body and it was formed on
popular demand,'' Bakri said in an interview.
   He said the guards would carry knives, clubs and walkie-talkies,
but that Israeli authorities would not let them carry guns.
   Uprising leaders have ordered all Palestinians who work for the
Israeli military government in the occupied territories, including
police, to quit their jobs.
   The army reinforced patrols and set up checkpoints on main
highways throughout the occupied lands.
   Troops searched Palestinian cars at roadblocks outside Jericho
and the Kalandia refugee camp in the West Bank. Police spokesman
Rafi Levy reported extra troops deployed in Arab areas of
Jerusalem, but said no clashes occurred.
   In one incident, a Jewish settler fired in the air after his
vehicle was stoned in Gaza City, but no one was injured, witnesses
said.
   Dozens of supporters of the left-wing Progressive List for
Peace, a mixed Arab-Jewish party that holds two seats in the
120-member Israeli parliament, demonstrated outside the northern
West Bank town of Qalqilya to protest last week's army raid in
which more than 200 Palestinian activists were arrested.
   Demonstrators carried placards calling on soldiers to refuse
service in the occupied lands, Israel television said.
   Secular Israelis meanwhile gathered throughout Israel for
picnics in beaches and backyards Monday to mark the Jewish New
Year, while observant Jews symbolically cast off their sins by
throwing the contents of their pockets into springs and streams.
   Mainly because of the Palestinian uprising, police deployed
thousands of officers in Israeli cities and urged residents to be
on the lookout for suspicious objects.
   At the Ein Gedi nature reserve, attendance was down markedly
from last year, apparently because many Israelis shied away from
the swing through the West Bank necessary to reach the Dead Sea.
   But hotels in the northern port city of Haifa were fully booked,
and 120,000 visitors were expected at the nearby Carmel Park over
the holiday.
   Tens of thousands of Israelis flocked to synagogues to listen to
rams' horns, or ``shofars,'' heralding the new year 5749. Rosh
Hashana is both a joyous and solemn holiday during which Jews begin
a 10-day period of atonement for sins of the previous year.
   Most shops and restaurants were closed, all public transporation
was halted, and the normally bustling centers of Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem were deserted.

<HEAD>$10 Million Suit Claims Horror Mistress Elvira a Vampira Rip-Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Horror movie hostess Elvira, queen of the
macabre on late night TV, is accused in a $10 million lawsuit of
pirating her campy pin-up character from another sultry horror
mistress.
   ``The character was ripped off,'' attorney Jan Goodman said
Monday.
   Ms. Goodman filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court last week on
behalf of Maila ``Vampira'' Nurmi, who contends actress Cassandra
``Elvira'' Peterson infringed upon her trademark, public reputation
and ability to market her lucrative character.
   ``Hopefully, my client will be fairly compensated and Cassandra
Peterson will continue with her character and share the proceeds
with my client,'' Ms. Goodman said.
   Miss Nurmi created the Vampira character in the 1950s, combining
sex appeal, humor and death as TV fright movie hostess, the lawsuit
said. In 1981, executives at KHJ-TV asked her to revive ``The
Vampira Show.''
   Instead, the lawsuit contends, Miss Nurmi was eased out after
turning over details pertaining to the image and persona of her
character, and Miss Peterson was installed as host of the
syndicated ``The Elvira Show.''
   ``There is no Elvira. There's only a pirated Vampira,'' said
Miss Nurmi, 65. ``Cassandra Peterson slavishly copied my product
and made a fortune. America has been duped.''
   In addition to Miss Peterson, defendants include KHJ-TV; NBC
Productions; Panacea Entertainment; and Elvira Merchandising Inc.
   KHJ withheld comment pending receipt of the lawsuit, but NBC
spokesman Jay Rodriguez said there was nothing indicating
wrongdoing by NBC Productions. He said NBC denies violating the
rights of Miss Nurmi.
   NBC is to air the upcoming movie ``Elvira.''
   ``As we have not yet been served nor officially informed of this
action, we decline comment at this time,'' said Eric Gardner,
spokesman for Miss Peterson, Panacea and Elvira Merchandising.

   An F-14 fighter jet crashed upside down
into a hangar at a suburban airfield Monday and exploded after two
crewmen ejected. The fliers and three people on the ground were
injured, officals said.
   ``It just dropped,'' eyewitness Glenn Janes said of the plane.
``It was a sea of flame after that. ... But I didn't hear any
screams for help.''
   The jet from Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego crashed into
the hangar at Gillespie Field on the northern edge of El Cajon, 15
miles east of downtown San Diego, officials said.
   The blaze destroyed the hangar and an attached extension, but
spared a nearby restaurant. At least six cars and three or four
planes parked on the ground were burned.
   The $35 million F-14, the fighter jet glamorized in the movie
``Top Gun,'' experienced mechanical problems and the two crewmen
tried to guide it to the runway at Gillespie before bailing out,
Navy and civilian police officials said.
   The jet did not carry any ordnance, they said.
   ``The pilot was trying to get it to hit the airport runway,''
steering clear of the residential and business areas surrounding
the airfield, El Cajon police Lt. Bill McClurg said.
   The Navy crewmen and three people in or near the hangar were
injured, McClurg said.
   Lt. j.g. Randall L. Furtado was listed in critical condition at
Sharp Memorial Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Laurie Pooley.
Another victim, William Grant, also was in critical condition, she
said.
   Lt. Cmdr. Jim Barnett, the pilot, was in stable condition at
Mercy Hospital with bruises and fractures, a hospital spokeswoman
said.
   Brian Jollis, a 40-year-old helicopter mechanic, was listed in
critical condition with burns over 35 percent of his body, said
Sheri Smith, a spokeswoman at UC San Diego Medical Center. A second
person hospitalized at UCSD, Bill Eulrich, 39, suffered smoke
inhalation and was listed in fair condition, Smith said.
   The pilots were returning to Miramar after a training mission
when they reported problems with the hydraulic system, which
controls the plane's flaps and other stabilizing equipment, said
Capt. Gary Hughes, commanding officer of NAS Miramar.

<HEAD>Bush Disputes McCarthyism Claim</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with comments on McCarthyism allegation,
ethnic coalition dismissals; and statement from Dukakis aide.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, trying to turn back charges of
``McCarthyism,'' scorned presidential rival Michael Dukakis anew
Monday as a liberal Democrat and ``a card-carrying member'' of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   Bush did not did not directly answer Dukakis' charge that
Republicans were attacking his patriotism, using the tactics of the
late-Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy.
   Speaking to a crowd of several thousand people at a shopping
center rally, Bush said: ``Recently, the governor of Massachusetts
accused me of McCarthyism.
   ``And it was suggested that when I said he is a card-carrying
member of the ACLU that that was McCarthyism; when I say he's a
liberal, that it's unfair.''
   ``No, he's that (Dukakis a member of the ACLU),'' Bush said.
``He says's he's that. He's that. I am the vice president of the
United States of America, a partner in (the) administration that
has turned this economy around, that has put America back to work,
that has strengthened our national security and that has enhanced
the peace.''
   Bush made no mention at the rally that five more members of an
ethnic coalition supporting his campaign had resigned under fire.
   However, Bush told reporters: ``Nobody's giving in. These people
left of their own volition. We're not accusing anybody of anything.
   ``We're getting into a very peculiar deal where some people are
accusing people. I don't like it a bit.''
   Earlier, in New Jersey, Bush challenged his opponent to say
whether he supported the Reagan administration on military issues
ranging from the American invasion of Grenada to the U.S. attack
against Moammar Gadhafi's Libya.
   ``If my opponent can't answer yes to all these important
questions, then I would submit to you that he has veered outside
the bipartisan mainstream, the vital consensus that has been at the
heart of America's national security for many, many years,'' Bush
said.
   On the other hand, Bush said, if Dukakis should answer ``yes''
then ``the people are entitled to know why he flip-flopped. And,
perhaps most important of all, how will we know he won't change his
positions again.''
   Returning to the campaign trail after a weekend in Washington,
Bush hammered Dukakis on defense and economic issues while courting
Cuban-American votes in New Jersey.
   ``I have just been told that my opponent is ending his so-called
`Stealth' candidacy,'' Bush said, quoting his own description of
Dukakis' campaign. He commented during a tour of Goya Foods, which
bills itself as the nation's largest privately owned Hispanic firm.
   Bush asked if Dukakis still regarded the Strategic Defense
Initiative as a fantasy, as he once said, and whether Dukakis was
willing to admit ``that your support for a nuclear freeze was a
mistake.''
   Before touring the plant in Secaucus, Bush raised some of the
same questions in a Union City, N.J., speech before a flag-waving
Cuban-American audience of upwards of 1,000 people.
   Beginning the day, Bush announced formation of a national
security advisory task force whose 13 members include former
Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger and Alexander M. Haig,
former Defense Secretaries Melvin Laird and Donald Rumsfeld, and
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser to Jimmy
Carter.
   Brzezinski, joining Bush at a Washington news conference, said
that of the two candidates for president, Bush ``is not a novice in
that critical area of public policy on which our national survival
depends.''
   Bush told his Cuban-American audience: ``I take great personal
pride in the fact that three of my grandchildren are half Mexican,
are Hispanic. You see, my family is doubly blessed. We have both
cultures in my family.''
   Referring to the invasion of Grenada, which at the time was
strengthening its ties with Cuba, and the bombing of Libya, Bush
said:
   ``And I will really admit that I am having trouble pinning down
the liberal governor of Massachusetts on his defense. He's all over
the field. So my question of the day: Does he support the attack on
Gadhafi that has resulted in less international terror and does he
support the attack on Grenada that has given those people the
freedom and democracy that sometimes we take for granted?''
   Dukakis foreign policy adviser James Steinberg said Dukakis
supported the invasion of Grenada for the purpose of rescuing
students, if their lives were threatened. He said the Reagan
administration's motivation to invade was ``clearly more than'' a
desire to rescue the students.
   Steinberg said ``there was legitimate basis for taking some
action against Libya,'' including action against terrorist camps,
but not bombing the tent where Gadhafi was believed to be. ``What
he does not support is the targeting of a head of state,''
Steinberg said.

   A firebombing that killed two young sisters and
critically injured a third was drug-related, authorities said
Monday.
   Police Col. James Hackett said the firebombing, which started a
fire in the home where the children were left unattended, was meant
for another man in the building. The attack resulted from an
apparent drug deal gone sour, he said.
   Sgt. Joe Marcinkiewicz of the bomb and arson squad said
investigators had determined that the firebomb was thrown through
the front window of the three-story building.
   Firefighters rescued the children from a second-floor window,
but Erica Butler, 1, and Ashley Evans, 4, died later at Children's
Hospital. Lenora Butler, 5 months, was in critical condition, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   Fire Department Battalion Chief Frank Schaper said the blaze,
which was reported about 11:40 p.m. Sunday, caused extensive damage.

responsible for taxi bombing; bomb defused in Armagh; Thatcher

<TEXT>
   A huge bomb placed in a taxi
blew up outside City Hall on Monday, injuring eight people who did
not have enough time to flee after a telephoned warning, police
said.
   Earlier Monday, two bombs set by guerrillas of the Irish
Republican Army badly damaged the home of Sir Kenneth Bloomfield,
head of Northern Ireland's civil service. Bloomfield, 57, his wife
and a son were not injured but were treated for shock.
   The blasts ripped holes in the brick house and shattered windows
in neary homes.
   A third bomb near the house was defused by British army experts,
police said.
   Police said that in Armagh, 35 miles southwest of Belfast,
demolitions experts defused a 500-pound bomb found near the
Drumsill Hotel.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the IRA
claimed responsibility for the blast outside City Hall that
shattered shop and office windows over a large area of downtown
Belfast. The agency did not say how it obtained its information on
the claim of responsibility.
   Police said two of the injured were in serious condition.
   The outlawed IRA had carried out a car bombing on Aug. 24 only
150 yards from the site of Monday's blast. Last month's explosion
caused more than $6.75 million in damage.
   In a statement, the IRA claimed responsibility for the
Bloomfield house attack in Helen's Bay, County Down, on the eastern
outskirts of Belfast, and said other civil servants in Northern
Ireland should resign their posts.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in Perth Scotland,
said, ``This is the first time we have had a direct bomb attack on
civil servants working in the Northern Ireland Office and it is a
matter of great concern to us. It just shows the IRA are now after
civilians.''
   The taxi bombing stirred concern that the IRA might be returning
to the ``commercial war'' of the 1970s that devastated the city
center. The mainly Roman Catholic organization is fighting to drive
the British from the Protestant-majority province and unite it with
the Catholic Irish Republic.
   The bomb went off between two office buildings in Donegall
Square, about 70 yards from City Hall. It was planted inside a
black taxi parked in a cab rank.
   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
practice, said that 11 minutes before the explosion a telephoned
warning was made to the Irish News newspaper. The spokesman said it
was very short warning time.
   Forty bus drivers were taking their break in a nearby cafeteria
minutes before the bomb went off.
   ``A policeman ran in and shouted that a bomb had been planted
outside,'' said a driver, who refused to give his name. ``Most of
us managed to get away but some of my colleagues were hit by flying
glass.''
   A second driver, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he had parked his bus and the passengers got off seconds before the
bomb exploded.
   ``I saw at least three drivers stagger up the road injured from
flying glass. One of them looked in quite a bad way and they were
all suffering from shock,'' he said.
   ``All I can remember is the force of the blast ... I have heard
explosions before but this one sounded like a really big one,'' he
said.
   Police swiftly sealed off the area to keep hundreds of people
still leaving their offices from getting near the site, as
shattered windows continued to drop shards of glass onto the
sidewalks.
   British and Irish officials are scheduled to meet Tuesday under
terms of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that give the Irish
government a consultative role in the British province.
   The meeting was requested by Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey to discuss the worsening security situation.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Six people claimed in a radio
broadcast Monday that they took part in a massacre at a Roman
Catholic church that left at least five dead and 77 wounded, and
warned that the slaughter ``was child's play.''
   The five men and one woman later appeared on Tele-Haiti, the
country's only private television station. In both broadcasts the
six said the bloody attack Sunday was aimed at Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the church pastor and a critic of the military government.
   One of the men said in the Radio Metropole interview, broadcast
Monday evening, that ``the people committed the massacre.
   ``We were after Father Aristide; what you saw yesterday was
child's play. In whatever parish Father Aristide is accepted, a
heap of corpses will attend that Mass,'' the man said.
   None of the six was identified.
   Richard Widmaier, manager of Radio Metropole, said the group
came to the station Monday afternoon and claimed participation in
the massacre at the church and the stoning later Sunday of two
other radio stations and the headquarters of two opposition leaders.
   During the television appearance, one of the men said the
slaughter at St. Jean Bosco Church was motivated by an internal
struggle between Aristide and another priest, but they did not
elaborate.
   Two dozen men with guns and machetes burst into the church
during a morning Mass in the La Saline slum and shot, stabbed and
slashed terrified parishioners, witnesses said.
   Witnesses said at least a dozen people were killed. Aristide
escaped unhurt and went into hiding.
   Doctors at the general hospital of the state university reported
five bodies were in the hospital morgue and 77 parishioners were
hospitalized.
   Among those injured were a woman and her infant _ both skewered
by the same steel pike while the baby girl was in her mother's
womb. An operation saved mother and child.
   Franck Romain, mayor of Port-au-Prince, said Aristide was
``justly punished.''
   But Arnold Antonin, head of the National Network for the Defense
of Human Rights, compared it to attacks on civilians that occurred
during the rule of dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and his
son, Jean-Claude.
   ``This act is unprecedented in our history,'' Antonin said.
``Even Papa Doc did not dare do such a thing _ penetrate the holy
precincts of a church and, after massacring unarmed worshipers,
burn it down.''
   Dr. Gerard Blot, who took part in surgery that saved the baby
and mother, told Radio Haiti-Inter the sharpened metal rod
penetrated the woman below the heart and wounded the baby.
   He said 10 others required emergency surgery, one for a bullet
wound and nine who were stabbed by skewers, a common homemade
weapon in Haiti.
   The rest suffered from various injuries, having been shot,
bludgeoned, trampled or slashed.
   Witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said Monday they
spotted Port-au-Prince city hall employees among the assailants,
but did not identify them. Witnesses said police and soldiers
watched the attack but did nothing to stop it.
   Romain, a former army colonel and police chief during the
29-year Duvalier era, denied the charge.
   ``If (city) employees were involved ... I don't see how I am
concerned ... I am not an anarchist, I am not someone who preaches
violence and who sends people out to die as Aristide has always
done,'' Romain said.
   ``Father Aristide has always preached violence ... He who sows
the wind, reaps the storm,'' Radio Metropole quoted Romain as
saying.
   Aristide, one of the most popular figures among the poor masses
in this Caribbean nation, regularly has preached against army
atrocities and has led his supporters in street demonstrations.
   Aristide has been the target of several assassination attempts
since Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy came to power as head of a three-man
junta on Feb. 7, 1986, the day Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile
in France.
   Romain, Port-au-Prince mayor until Duvalier's ouster, returned
to that office in army-run elections in January and remained after
Namphy ousted civilian President Leslie Manigat in a military coup
in June. Namphy was head of the military under the Duvalier regime.
   The mayor was a member of a firing squad in the Nov. 12, 1964,
execution of two survivors of ``Young Haiti,'' a group of
U.S.-based anti-Duvalier activists who invaded the country. Romain
personally shot and killed two group members.
   ``On Sunday, (the forces of law and order) stood by ... and let
a massacre take place,'' Antonin said. The radio reports said
police and soldiers looked on from an army compound across the
street as 300 assailants stoned the church.
   A smaller group of men armed with machetes, sticks and guns then
entered the church and began attacking worshipers.
   In Washington, State Department spokeman Charles Redman
condemned the police behavior.
   ``In spite of the fact that all of these attacks occurred in
close proximity to various police and military installations, no
actions were taken by the competent authorites to intervene while
the attack were taking place,'' Redman said Monday.
   Manigat, who lives in the United States, denounced the incident
as the work of Namphy's secret police.
   ``Brute force is the principal instrument of those who now
control the country,'' Manigat said from his home in Maryland. ``It
is the same killers of the Duvalier time organizing the new
terror.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Bush Has Failed; Bush Challenges Dukakis on Military</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: UPDATES and EDITS throughout to include Bush comments on
McCarthyism charge; poll results.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis charged Monday that an unsteady George
Bush botched his assignments in the battle against drugs and
terrorism, while the Republican nominee challenged Dukakis to state
his views on the U.S. strike against Libya and invasion of Grenada.
   Bush also scorned presidential rival Michael Dukakis anew Monday
as a liberal Democrat and ``a card-carrying member'' of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   Speaking to a crowd of several thousand people at a shopping
center rally in Alton, Ill., Bush referred to a recent charge by
Dukakis that Bush had engaged in McCarthyism, a reference to the
vigilante tactics of the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy.
   ``Recently, the governor of Massachusetts accused me of
McCarthyism,'' Bush said. ``And it was suggested that when I said
he is a card-carrying member of the ACLU that that was McCarthyism;
when I say he's a liberal, that it's unfair.
   ``No, he's that. He says's he's that. He's that.''
   Bush made no mention at the rally that five more members of an
ethnic coalition supporting his campaign had resigned under fire.
   The vice president's ``Coalition of American Nationalities,''
lost five of its members when they resigned Monday in the wake of
charges of anti-Semitism and Holocaust revisionism among some of
its officials.
   The controversy arose after Washington Jewish Week reported that
some of the five had ties to anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi movements and
apparent neo-fascist associations.
   The resignations came one day after Frederic Malek, a Bush
appointee to the Republican National Committee, stepped down after
a published report said he tallied the number of Jewish employees
at the Bureau of Labor Statistics while serving in the Nixon
administration.
   The most recent poll, meanwhile, puts Dukakis and Bush in a
virtual dead heat among registered voters. The CNN-USA Today poll
released Monday night indicates that 48 percent favor Bush to 46
percent for Dukakis.
   The survey of 1,260 certain voters last week by the Gordon Black
Corporation had a three-point margin of error.
   Dukakis, launching a three-day counteroffensive against
Republican charges he would cripple American defense and foreign
policy, told 200 supporters at a union hall in Philadelphia that
Bush was ``disastrously and completely and unforgivably wrong'' for
not warning President Reagan against selling arms to Iran in an
attempt to free hostages.
   Later, Dukakis ran into some boos when he visited a GE plant in
Evendale, Ohio, that makes engines for the Stealth bomber. He told
1,000 workers that work on the radar-evading aircraft began under a
Democratic administration and ``it's going to be completed in my
administration, you can count on it.''
   But some workers booed and chanted ``Bush, Bush.'' One sign
read, ``Keep your job, vote for Bush.''
   Dukakis' unqualified statement of support for the Stealth bomber
appeared to go beyond earlier campaign statements that he supported
continued research on the project. Dukakis issues adviser James
Steinberg said Dukakis was committed to deployment of the aircraft
provided ``it is affordable and it works,'' and said that
represents no change in position.
   Dukakis said he would restore respect for America, which he said
had been undermined by Reagan-Bush failures to combat terrorism,
come to grips with the trade deficit and stop ``the avalanche of
drugs ... pouring across our borders.''
   ``I want to beat our foreign competitors; he's willing to settle
for second best. I want to crack down on terrorism; he knuckled
under to the ayatollah. I want a real war on drugs; his answer to
drug kingpins like (Panama leader Manuel) Noriega is J. Danforth
Quayle,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, at a news conference in Washington and later at a rally
before 1,000 flag-waving Cuban-Americans in Union City, N.J.,
cudgeled Dukakis on defense and foreign affairs as well as the
economy.
   ``I will really admit that I am having trouble pinning down the
liberal governor of Massachusetts on his defense,'' Bush said in
New Jersey.
   Bush demanded that Dukakis spell out whether he supported the
1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya and the 1983 invasion ``to free
Grenada from its Cuban masters.''
   If the answer is no, he said, Dukakis would show himself to have
``veered outside the bipartisan mainstream'' on national security
issues. He also asked whether Dukakis would admit ``that your
support for a nuclear freeze was a mistake.''
   Dukakis had his own questions for Bush, ranging from the
Iran-Contra affair to why the Reagan administration cut funds for
the Coast Guard and aid for state and local drug agencies while it
put ``General Noriega on its payroll.'' Noriega is under indictment
on drug trafficking charges.
   ``What kind of judgment is this?'' Dukakis asked. ``What kind of
priorities are these? ... We need better leadership from the next
president.''
   Earlier Monday, Bush named a panel of national security advisers
including former Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger and
Alexander M. Haig as well as Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was Democrat
Jimmy Carter's national security adviser.
   Introducing Brzezinski, Bush said his objective was ``to shape a
foreign policy built on the principles of bipartisanship ...
realism, strength, dialogue and engagement.''
   Brzezinski said Bush ``has been tested in the international
arena and he has a wide-ranging grasp of international realities.
He's not a novice in that critical area of foreign policy on which
our national survival depends.''
   Dukakis has opposed the MX and Midgetman missiles and has called
the Strategic Defense Initiative a fantasy, although he emphasized
last week he would continue basic SDI research at a reduced level.
   Bush's running mate, Quayle, touring a plant and addresing a
Rotary Club in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that if Dukakis wins, ``his
hand'll be back in your pocket'' and the Democrats will ``return us
once again to those chilling days of no growth'' under Carter.
   His counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, spent the day in
Washington attending to Senate duties.

   President Alfredo Stroessner returned
to his desk Monday, ending a 12-day absence that generated a wave
of rumors that he had undergone surgery and was gravely ill.
   Gen. Stroessner, 75, was undergoing a complete medical
examination in preparation for an October visit to Taiwan, said
Juan Jose Benitez Rickmann, undersecretary for information, in
explaining the president's unusual absence.
   Stroessner, who has ruled this South American nation of 3.8
million inhabitants since a 1954 coup, arrived at the Presidential
Palace at 10 a.m. and met with his ministers for the interior,
foreign relations, industry and treasury, Benitez Rickmann told The
Associated Press.
   The president's absence sparked a rumor, circulating initially
in diplomatic circles, that he had undergone prostrate surgery on
Aug. 31 at Asuncion's Social Security Hospital. Hospital officials
refused to comment on the rumor.
   Other rumors indicated that Stroessner was gravely ill. A
Mendoza, Argentina radio station interrupted programming on
Saturday to report, without citing the source of its information,
that the president had died. Benitez Rickmann described the report
as ``false and irresponsible.''

<HEAD>Manglapus Meeting U.S. Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philippines Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus,
that country's chief negotiator in deadlocked negotiations over the
future of strategic U.S. bases in the islands, is to meet here
Tuesday with senior Reagan administration officials.
   State Department and Philippine Embassy officials said
Manglapus, who arrived in the United States during the weekend,
would talk with Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of state for
Asian and Pacific affairs, followed by meetings with Secretary of
State George Shultz, Deputy Secretary John C. Whitehead and Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   On Wednesday, Manglapus was scheduled to open a series of talks
with congressional leaders, and on Friday he was to speak at a
meeting in the State Department of the U.S.-Asia Institute.
   Proposed payments of hundreds of millions of dollars a year
separated the two governments when Manglapus in late July suspended
an ongoing review in Manila of future U.S. use of Clark Field air
base, Subic Bay naval station and four smaller installations in the
Philippines.
   A report from Manila said the Philippines had insisted on a $1.2
billion annual U.S. payment for use of the bases after the current
agreement expires in 1991. Various reports said the United States,
now paying about $180 million a year, offered substantial increases
that, however, fell far below the reported demand.
   U.S. officials also continued to object to describing U.S. aid
payments to the Philippines as compensation or rent for the bases,
maintaining the arrangement was part of a defense package with many
mutual advantages. They also said the breakoff of the talks was
temporary. The Philippines side called it an indefinite breakoff
because of what Manglapus described as an inflexible U.S. position.
   Manglapus became well known in Washington when he lived here in
exile during the administration of ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos before returning to Manila to join President Corazon
Aquino's government. He planned to attend the U.N. General Assembly
starting next week and to meet again with Shultz on Sept. 30 in New
York, the State Department said.

<HEAD>Controversial School Dropout Program Revised</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE SILVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial program that paid
potential dropouts to go to class has been revised this year
because of negative attention it generated, school officials said
Monday.
   Red Bank High School received national attention last year when
it began paying problem students $5 a day, or $25 a week, to attend
classes regularly, be punctual, do their homework and behave
themselves.
   ``It was picked up by the media as `Oh, my God, you're paying
kids to go to school,''' said Principal Robert Nogueira. He said
the concept was viewed as ``almost un-American.''
   Critics said the program was unfair because it paid some
students to achieve what were minimal requirements for the rest,
and violated the ideal of education being an end in itself.
   Officials denied the students were being paid to study. Instead,
they said they were getting ``needs-based'' subsidies for improving
their academic performance and changing their behavior.
   National television crews came to the school, students were
interviewed on the radio and newspapers reported on the program.
   ``There seemed to be a lot of hoopla going on about how we were
doing it,'' said Robert Lock, a work placement coordinator at the
school who helped draft this year's program. ``The attention being
paid to it was taking away from our time rather than being with the
young people.''
   This year potential dropouts will be paid $4 a day for attending
a one-hour program outside regular class hours, school officials
said.
   During the hour, which may be before or after classes, they will
receive tutoring and help with homework, get counseling on their
attitude toward school, and prepare for the state high school
proficiency tests. The test is required in New Jersey to receive a
diploma.
   ``This is fairer because the student has to come in the hour
before or the hour after school, which is a good commitment to
make,'' Lock said. ``We think it will accomplish similar goals but
not attract the type of attention the other (program) seemed to
attract.''
   Students will be required to complete the program requirements
five days in a row to receive the all-or-nothing weekly payment.
   The revised program will be trimmed back considerably, with the
budget slashed from $108,000 to $50,000, Nogueira said. The funding
comes from a federal grant under the Job Training and Partnership
Act.
   Nogueira said less money was budgeted because not all those
eligible can be persuaded to participate. Last year, for example,
only 48 of 130 targeted students took part.
   An analysis also found the program is not appropriate for
students with especially high absentee rates or disciplinary
problems, Lock said.
   Despite the controversy, officials said the program was a
success. At the end of the school year, 70 percent of the 48
participants had passed the high school proficiency test.
   ``We're not suggesting this is the way for everyone to go but we
do know financial incentives are part of our culture,'' Nogueira
said.

   Margaret B. McFarland, the child psychologist
children's television show host Fred Rogers described as ``the most
major influence in my professional life,'' died Monday after a long
illness. She was 83.
   Highly regarded and recognized in the fields of child
development, education and psychology, Miss McFarland co-founded
the Arsenal Family and Children's Center with Dr. Benjamin Spock
and Erik Erikson in 1953 and served as its director until 1971.
   She helped establish the department of child development and
child care within the psychiatry department of University of
Pittsburgh's School of Medicine in the early 1950s.
   ``She was so other-directed that when you were in her presence
you felt you were important,'' said Rogers, host of ``Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood.'' The show is produced at WQED-TV, a
Pittsburgh public television station.
   Miss McFarland earned master's and doctorate degrees at Columbia
University in 1928 and 1938. She was an associate professor of
psychology in Columbia's psychiatry department from 1951 through
1975 and became associate professor emeritus in 1976. The
department is now part of the university's school of social work.
   She later became a consultant for Rogers' television show,
reviewing scripts and song lyrics.

   Britain on Monday ordered Cuba's ambassador and
third secretary to leave the country because of a shooting incident
involving the junior diplomat, the Foreign Ministry announced.
   No casualties were reported officially and police gave few
details about gunshots at a building in central London and the
arrest of Third Secretary Carlos Manuel Medina Perez.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, quoted a
witness as saying one person, who was not identified, was wounded.
   The Daily Mail said Medina Perez opened fire because he believed
he was being trailed by an assassination squad. It did not give
attribution for its report.
   Foreign Office Minister Timothy Eggar told Cuban Ambassador
Oscar Fernandez-Mell that he and Medina Perez must leave Britain by
midnight Tuesday.
   A Vietnamese diplomat left Britain Sunday, expelled for
brandishing a handgun during a demonstration earlier this month by
refugees outside the Vietnamese Embassy.
   Britain moved quickly against the Cubans.
   A Foreign Office statement said: ``We understand from the police
that at about 4:30 p.m. (11:30 a.m. EDT) today (Monday) an incident
occurred in Sussex Gardens, London, W2, when a number of shots were
fired by a man subsequently identified as a third secretary at the
Cuban Embassy.
   ``Senor Perez has indicated to the police that he fired the
shots fearing for his own safety.''
   The statement reported ``Mr. Eggar said that this incident could
not under any circumstances be justified. The British government
would not tolerate the use of firearms by diplomats. Mr. Eggar said
that the ambassador must bear the responsibility for this grave
development.
   ``The only appropriate response was that he must insist that the
ambassador and Senor Perez should leave the United Kingdom as soon
as possible, but at the latest by midnight tomorrow.''
   Fernandez-Mell, summoned to the Foreign Office by Eggar, said
before going into the meeting, ``I don't know what happened. There
was some trouble in the hall of a man's house. Some men attacked
him (Medina Perez). But I don't know anything about a gun. It was
just a little problem.''
   The ambassador made no comment when he left after a 20-minute
meeting.
   Eggar, speaking to reporters later, said he told the ambassador
``behavior of the kind that went on this afternoon was simply not
acceptable.''
   Police headquarters at Scotland Yard made only a brief report.
   It said police were summoned when there were reports of shots
being fired and when they arrived, ``a foreign male surrendered
himself and a gun and he was immediately arrested.
   ``It is alleged he fired a number of rounds at persons nearby
who immediately dispersed.''
   ``On arrival at Paddington Green police station the man claimed
he was entitled to full diplomatic privilege and once this was
established he was released,'' the police report said.
   Press Association and the Daily Mail gave these accounts:
   The newspaper said Medina Perez drew a gun as he stepped from
his car outside a building where the Cuban Embassy has an apartment
in Sussex Gardens, believing men in another auto were about to open
fire.
   ``He fired at the group, who were thought to be Arab or
Hispanic,'' the Daily Mail said. ``The men scattered and the envoy
fired at one as he ran near a passing bus .... The men escaped and
the Cuban fled into the block of flats (apartments) ... and
barricaded himself in the official ... apartment.''
   It said a Diplomatic Protection Squad arrived from Scotland Yard
and cordoned off the area.
   Two police officers negotiated with the Cuban diplomat from an
adjacent balcony and used a mirror on a pole to look into the
apartment to see if any other gunmen were inside, according to the
Daily Mail.
   Press Association said Medina Perez fired up to five shots at a
car containing four people. It quoted an unidentified witness as
saying she saw the four run away, with one holding a blood-soaked
handkerchief to his head.
   Britain has strict gun laws and most police officers do not
carry firearms.
   The issue of diplomats possessing weapons became extremely
sensitive after the killing of a policewoman by a gunman firing
from inside the Libyan Embassy during a protest demonstration
outside the embassy in April 1984. After a police siege, the
embassy was closed and diplomatic relations with Libya were severed.
   Vietnamese Third Secretary Khang Than Nhan was expelled and left
Sunday after he was accused of brandishing a gun during a
demonstration by Vietnamese refugees at the Vietnamese Embassy on
Sept. 4.
   The Vietnamese ambassador first turned over a toy gun, the
Foreign Office said, but later returned with a real gun and
apologized for the incident.

   Two Afghan warplanes were hit over
Pakistan by missiles fired by U.S.-made Pakistani F-16s and were
believed to have been destroyed, the Defense Ministry said.
   A ministry statement said the two planes were among six Afghan
aircraft that intruded in Pakistani airspace with the aim of
bombing targets here.
   ``Search for the wreckage is in progress for final confirmation
(that the two planes were destroyed),'' the statement said, adding
that all Pakistani planes returned safely.
   The ministry said, ``Six Afghan aircraft on Monday violated the
border of Pakistan, north of Nawagai in the North West Frontier
province with the intent of bombing our territory.'' Nawagai is 120
miles northwest of Islamabad, and 12 miles from the Afghan border.
   ``Two Pakistan air force F-16 aircraft intercepted the raiders
and engaged two of the Afghan aircraft with air-to-air missiles at
high altitude.
   ``All video and electronic sensors on board the F-16s indicate
positively that the two intruders were hit by missiles.''
   The statement gave no further details.
   Pakistan also claimed last Wednesday to have downed an intruding
Afghan plane after several Afghan warplanes were engaged by
Pakistani F-16s. The ministry also put the scene of the engagement
then as Nawagai. But state-run Radio Kabul called the Pakistani
claim ``baseless'' and ``a lie.'' It challenged Pakistan to produce
the wreckage. Islamabad failed to do so.
   If verified, the Wednesday and Monday claims would make a total
of six warplanes shot down by Pakistan since the guerrilla war in
Afghanistan began.
   Those include a Soviet-piloted Su-25 warplane which Pakistan
shot down over its territory Aug. 4. The Soviet pilot, Col.
Alexander Vladimirovich Rudskoi, was captured, but was handed over
to the Soviet Embassy in Islamabad on Aug. 17.
   Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have suffered since late
1979, when Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan to support
Afghanistan's pro-Moscow government. Thousands of anti-communist
guerrillas have fought the Soviet troops and Afghan forces since
then. Moscow and Kabul accuse Pakistan, the United States and China
of aiding the guerrillas militarily.
   Half of the 115,000 Soviet troops have left Afghanistan by the
stipulated date of Aug. 15, under U.N.-brokered Geneva accords
signed last April 14. The remaining troops are to leave by next
Feb. 15.
   Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States and the Soviet Union
signed the accords as a step toward bringing peace in Afghanistan.
   Earlier Monday, guerrillas were reported to have taken two key
border garrisons in southeastern Afghanistan in a series of
communist defeats there. Guerrillas and Western diplomatic sounces
said the Kabul government moved thousands of troops to the
provincial capital of Kandahar to shore up defenses sagging from
weeks of guerrilla onslaughts.
   ``Reports we have received concerning the regime's situation in
(southeastern) Afghanistan indicate that the position of the regime
is deteriorating,'' said one Western diplomatic source in Islamabad.
   The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Kandahar has long been seen as a key element in the insurgents'
drive to capture provincial capitals as Soviet forces withdraw.
   The guerrillas claim they overran the border garrison of Spin
Boldak after a two-month siege last Friday, capturing many weapons
and large amounts of ammunition.
   The following day, guerrillas claimed a similar victory farther
up the border at Khair Kot in Paktika province, also a key supply
route.
   The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, reject
all offers for a political settlement with the communists. They
have taken two provincial capitals this summer: Talogan in the
north and Bamyan west of Kabul. They also briefly held the key
northern city of Kunduz before heavy Soviet aerial bombardment
forced them to flee.
   The guerrillas also repeatedly penetrated Kabul's fortress-like
defenses to launch a series of blistering rocket attacks in recent
weeks.
   On Sunday, a large car bomb exploded on a main shopping street
near the Pakistan Embassy, killing 10 people and wounding about 40.

   The pilot of a TWA jetliner
hijacked by Arab terrorists in 1985 testified Monday that Mohammed
Ali Hamadi took pleasure in torturing the passengers and fired the
shot that killed an American sailor.
   Capt. John Testrake, who commanded the plane during the ordeal,
told the court he believed Hamadi was the more violent of two
hijackers who invaded the jetliner's cabin and later killed Robert
Stethem, a U.S. Navy diver.
   But under questioning by defense lawyers, Testrake said he did
not actually see Hamadi pull the trigger.
   ``I want to make an important statement,'' Testrake said. ``I
did say before that one of the two (hijackers) appeared to do more
of the communicating and the other more of the violence.''
   He said, ``It appeared that one of the hijackers (Hamadi)
enjoyed beating the passengers more ... to inflict violence.
   ``Looking at this man now, I was struck that ... this is the man
who I recall had stood in the forward entry way and shot Stethem.''

   A wind-whipped fire racing through
the Gold Rush country of the Sierra Nevada foothills destroyed 13
homes and forced more than 4,500 people to evacuate on Monday for a
second time.
   By midday, the ``49er Fire'' had burned an estimated 15,000
acres, or nearly 25 square miles, of western Nevada County.
   The small community of Rough and Ready also was threatened, but
there was no immediate threat to the region's two largest
communities, Grass Valley and Nevada City.
   The blaze was fueled by drought-dry brush, wood shake roofs and
propane tanks which exploded like small bombs in the intense heat,
said state Department of Forestry spokesman Charlie Jakobs.
   No injuries were reported, although about 40 men in two fire
crews were forced to use their portable fire shelters when wind
shifted suddenly and swept the flames over them.

increase is expected in 1989.
   The department estimated the corn harvest, which is under way,
at a five-year low of 4.46 billion bushels, down 37 percent from
7.06 billion bushels harvested in 1987.

onto $14,000 in telephone stock and by assisting longtime friend E.
Robert Wallach.
   ``A major purpose of this memorandum is to remind and inform
that simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the mark of public
service,'' concluded ethics office Director Frank Nebeker.
   In a 17-page critique of Meese's ethical behavior sent to ethics
officers in the federal government, Nebeker said, ``The duties
imposed by non-criminal standards are far harder to discharge. They
may even be strange and seem overly restrictive to some joining
government for the first time. But, they must not be ignored under
the real pressures of other official duties.''
   James Rocap, a lawyer for Meese, said in a statement, ``We are
dismayed'' by Nebeker's memo, that Meese's ``integrity and
reputation have been unfairly impugned'' and that Nebeker had
rejected a request to meet with Meese's attorneys.

   The president of Bangladesh appealed
Monday for more foreign aid to feed more than 40 million people
left homeless by the flood, and doctors tried to halt an epidemic
of diarrhea.
   More than 250,000 people were suffering from diarrhea, the
health center said, with nearly 36,000 new cases reported in the
last 24 hours. Many got the disease by drinking water contaminated
by raw sewage and flood waters.
   A senior doctor who declined to be identified said about 5
percent of the diarrhea patients have contracted cholera.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad said the $280 million in aid
so far promised to his country was not enough even to rebuild roads
washed away by flood waters that cover three-fourths of the country.
   He said it was too early to estimate the total amount of funds
needed.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A human rights leader said Monday
that a bloody church massacre in which at least five people were
killed was part of a campaign to return Haiti to the dark days of
the Duvalier regime.
   But Franck Romain, the mayor of Port-au-Prince and a former high
official under the Duvaliers, said the radical priest whose church
was attacked and burned by armed men during a Mass on Sunday was
``justly punished.''
   At least five people were killed and 60 wounded when two dozen
men burst into the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide's St. Jean Bosco
church in the La Saline slum and shot or stabbed terrified
parishioners, radio stations said.
   Witnesses said at least a dozen people were killed. Aristide, an
outspoken critic of Haiti's military rulers, escaped unhurt and
went into hiding.

   An unlikely coalition of wealthy
housewives and cattlemen is spearheading opposition to Mexico's
first nuclear power plant.
   The plant, Laguna Verde, has been a pet project of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party for more than 20 years.
   But the party, which lost ground to the opposition in the July 6
general election, announced soon afterward that it was delaying the
plant's startup.
   ``After July 6, nothing is the same,'' said Rebecca Labastida, a
founder of the Mothers of Veracruz Anti-nuclear Committee, one of
several groups that have been working to get the plant mothballed
or converted to non-nuclear fuel.
   The coalition of urban housewives and cattle ranchers fighting
the project includes members of the governing party.

   A minister went on trial Monday on
charges of beheading a handyman and burning down his church in an
alleged attempt to assume a new identity and disappear with $50,000
in church money.
   Jury selection is expected to take most of the week in the
first-degree murder and arson trial of the Rev. John David Terry,
who faces the death penalty if convicted.
   Terry may take the witness stand to break his yearlong silence
in the decapitation of James C. Matheny.
   The slaying and fire on June 15, 1987, at Emmanuel Church of
Christ Pentecostal Oneness stunned Terry's parishioners. Some have
stuck by him since Matheny's body was found rolled up in a scorched

<HEAD>Gold Boom Brings Money to Impoverished Area in Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARACALE, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six years ago, Macario Galero made
a modest living by farming coconuts and operating a small food
shop. Today, he is one of the ``high graders'' exploiting a gold
boom in this small coastal town and has moved up the ladder of
affluence.
   Officials estimate that as many as 20,000 people are involved in
gold mining or prospecting here in Camarines Norte province. More
than 100,000 others work the mines in Davao del Norte province,
northern Luzon, Masbate Island and other areas of the Philippines.
   Gold had been mined in Camarines Norte since before World War
II, in the hills overlooking the Pacific in this town of about
25,000 about 120 miles southeast of Manila.
   But in December 1952, a mine cave-in here killed 56 miners and
brought a halt to large-scale mining operations. The town's source
of livelihood reverted to fishing and coconuts, and many young men
sought work abroad.
   In the early 1980s, however, the rise in the world gold prices
rekindled interest in mining and triggered a ``gold rush'' here and
other areas of the Philippines.
   ``I think it was a gift from God that they found gold here,''
said Pepito David, the town judge. ``Because otherwise, the people
would be suffering. Before gold, there was nothing but fishing.''
   About six major mining corporations, including Benguet
Consolidated Mining Corp., and Abcar-Paragon Mining Corp., operate
in Paracale and nearby towns.
   Officials at Abcar-Paragon, which employs about 300 people,
declined to give details of their operation. But local engineers
estimate the Philippine-Australian joint venture is mining about
500 tons of ore a day.
   In general, refiners can extract about 4.5 grams of gold from
each ton of ore, for a total daily yield from the 500 tons of about
2,250 grams, or 78,75 ounces. At current world prices, that much
gold could fetch around $34,000, depending on the quality.
   Mining sources believe the company's claim includes veins with
an estimated richness of 14 grams per ton, making it one of the
country's richest reserves.
   But much of the mining here is done by ``high graders'' _
independent prospectors who scour the riverbeds and sink deep
shafts in the hills in hopes of a strike.
   Although few are getting rich by world standards, most are
earning more than they would by fishing or harvesting coconuts.
   Galero's operation is typical of the ``high graders.'' He owns
the land and finances digging operations in return for a share of
whatever the prospectors find.
   Startup costs, including tools, generators, refining equipment,
chemicals and food, run from $500 to $1,000, mining sources said.
   Like other ``high graders,'' Galero declined to say how much he
has earned. Much of the gold is sold on the black market to avoid
taxes. Some miners say they are afraid jealous rivals will jump
their claims if their profits are made public.
   But Galero said that in April, his crews were mining ore with a
richness of 15 grams of gold per ton, a rich find. Fifteen grams
would fetch about $226 at world prices.
   Some engineers say small-scale ``high graders'' in Camarines
Norte average up to one gram of gold a day.
   Miners in Davao del Norte, a larger operation than those in
Camarines Norte, receive as much as $225 a week, more than 10 times
what a farm worker normally earns in the Philippines.
   With his profits, Galero has been able to build a stone house in
a neighborhood where others live in huts of coconut leaves. His
home includes a color television set and a video, luxuries in this
area.
   ``Certainly, it's meant more money for the people,'' said banker
Frank Garcia. ``We've noticed an increase in deposits, because
people are directly benefited by the boom.''
   At one site, atop a jungle ridge south of town, about 50 miners
dig at three shafts, each 50 to 100 feet deep and about five feet
square.
   From the base, tiny, crawl-space tunnels fan out toward
hoped-for veins. Miners descend into the pits on makeshift rope
pulleys, working for about an hour before returning to the surface
for a respite from the heat below.
   Laborers on the surface haul up the ore in large sacks, then
transfer it to ``milling stations,'' where the stones are ground
into powder in gasoline- or diesel-powered cylindrical drums.
   Mercury is added to the powdered ore. The gold dust then sticks
to the mercury and is separated from the ground stone.
   Gold mining has also spawned a number of other businesses, from
vendors who sell miners soft drinks and fried bananas to jewelry
smiths who buy gold from middle-men and then sell finished products
as far away as Manila.
   ``Most of our inhabitants are engaged in small-scale mining
nowadays,'' said Vice Mayor Edgar Dasco. ``The people are employed,
and the number of business establishments is increasing.''
   Local residents say that so far, Paracale has been spared the
ill effects the gold boom has brought to Davao del Norte. These
include a sharp increase in armed robberies, slayings and scores of
deaths due to cave-ins.
   ``This is not yet a problem because of family ties and
religiosity of the people,'' said Rev. Efren Sanchez, the local
Roman Catholic priest.
   Still, he worries about the long-term effects of people getting
``quick money.''
   ``When they get money, they spend the money,'' Sanchez said.
``It's easy money, and they don't think about the future.''

<HEAD>Hondurans and Contras Concerned as Reagan Term Nears Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the Reagan administration's
Contra policy battered, the Contra rebels and the Honduran
government look to Washington to accept responsibility for the
failed effort to oust the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
   Thousands of Contras and their supporters streamed across the
Nicaraguan border in the past four months into base camps in the
rugged, pine-covered Honduran mountains. The Honduran government
looks warily at a swell of armed foreigners within its borders and
worries they could become permanent refugees.
   ``These guys have been fighting because the United States has
given them economic and military aid,'' the Honduran Foreign
Ministry spokesman, Eugenio Castro, said in an interview. ``If the
United States suddenly pulls the rug, the ethical and moral
responsibility is to take them to the United States.''
   The Contra combatants put the blame for their exodus on the U.S.
Congress, which shut off military aid at the end of February.
Non-lethal funding approved a month later specified that the
supplies be distributed within Honduras.
   ``The aid has had more negative effects to our troops than the
Sandinistas. The Sandinistas never forced our troops out of the
country,'' Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in a telephone
interview from his Washington home.
   The Contras, backed by the United States since their formation
in 1981, seek the ouster of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. The
Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that desposed
dictator Anastasio Somoza and gave Nicaragua a leftist government.
   The rebels claim the peace process started in March with the
Sandinistas has failed. They profess a willingness to return to
battle but say they cannot face the Soviet-supplied Sandinista army
without military aid.
   The rebels managed last year to stalemate the seven-year war
along the nation's central spine. But they apparently lacked the
popular support base to obtain food and clothes. A fragile truce
that started with the March peace talks remains in place.
   The Reagan administration favors renewed military assistance,
but chances remain slim Congress will approve it during an election
year. The United States remains vague about its plans for the
Contra fighters and supporters within Honduran terrtory.
   Both the Contras and the Hondurans express concern about the
problems here becoming lost in other election issues. Republican
presidential candidate George Bush favors renewed military aid,
while Democratic contender Michael Dukakis opposes it.
   ``We don't see it in terms of the Reagan administration,''
Contra spokesman Matamoros said. ``We consider it in terms of the
United States. We want a clear policy from the United States, which
we have not had.''
   One solution that the Foreign Ministry's Castro termed as
``absolutely out of the question'' was the possibility of Honduras
allowing the Contras to obtain legal residency.
   ``We cannot, we will not take them as residents,'' Castro said.
``This is a poor country. We don't have enough for our own people.''
   The numbers of Contras in eastern Honduras vary. Interior
Minister Enrique Ortez Colindres recently put the figure of
fighters at 12,000, while the rebels said there were about 10,000.
The civilians were said to number 5,000 to 30,000, and Ortez
Colindres said as many as 300 more civilians arrive daily.
   Almost 40,000 legal refugees from El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Guatemala live in United Nations-run camps. Honduras estimates that
up to 200,000 others, mostly Nicaraguans, are in the country
illegally.
   ``All we can do (for the Contras and supporters) is take them to
refugee camps and seek help from a third country,'' Castro said.
   President Jose Azcona of Honduras said recently the Contras
present a ``serious problem.'' The armed forces expressed their
concern.
   Honduras, a staunch U.S. ally, became the cornerstone for the
Reagan administration's Central American policies. Tens of
thousands of American troops pass through yearly for military
manuevers. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ran the Contra
training and resupply programs from Honduran military bases.
   Honduras, in exchange, received millions of dollars in U.S.
economic and military aid, although for years the government
officially denied the presence of the Contras.
   The issue recently was highlighted, apparently with the tacit
consent of the Hondurans, by the Contras, who ferried groups of
journalists to the remote camps to show the plight of the fighters
and the civilians.
   Matamoros said the Contras seek military aid and not refuge.
   ``The bottom card is not a green card,'' he said in reference to
the U.S. immigration card given to resident aliens. ``We are not
begging to get into a refugee camp or to the United States.''

<HEAD>American Companies Scramble to Get Ready for 1992 in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American companies are scrambling to
make sure they are not shut out of the lucrative new market that
will be formed in Western Europe in 1992.
   That's when the 12 nations of the European Economic Community
(EEC) remove the many trade barriers separating them.
   ``We're living through a historic period in Europe. It is all
happening. You ignore it at your peril,'' said Eamonn Bates,
European Community affairs manager for the American Chamber of
Commerce in Brussels, the EEC headquarters.
   ``Every aspect of doing business in Europe is going to change.''
   In response, top U.S. companies are opening special offices,
reviewing business strategies and hiring consultants to get ready
for the next decade when the EEC becomes a single market of 320
million consumers.
   ``American companies in Europe are taking the issue very, very
seriously,'' said Walter di Pretoro, who recently assumed his post
as senior vice president for EEC affairs for Honeywell.
   Many executives say the far-reaching changes, while spurring
greater competition, should lead to reduced costs and bigger sales.
   ``You're going to operate in a much more difficult
environment,'' said Antonio Patron, government affairs manager for
Hewlett-Packard in Geneva. ``(But) if you play your cards right,
you will benefit substantially.''
   Reagan administration officials, though, worry that the
Europeans might use their newfound togetherness to try to keep out
U.S. and other foreign competition.
   Alfred Kingon, the U.S. Ambassador to the EEC, said in an
interview, ``What I'm afraid of ... is that when the barriers come
down, the competition among themselves is going to be so great ...
that there will be an instinctive protectionist push.''
   European officials might decide, he said, ``all right we'll open
it up internally, but we'll have to limit it externally.''
   ``They insist it won't happen,'' he said. ``I hope they're
right.''
   Community officials dismiss concerns they will create a
``Fortress Europe'' in 1992.
   ``These fears are totally unjustified,'' Willy de Clercq, the
EEC's top trade official, said in a recent speech.
   The idea of the European-wide market is to reduce the barriers
that keep goods, services, people and money from moving freely
among the 12 EEC countries: Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal
and Spain.
   They would, put simply, become more like the United States where
people and goods, with some exceptions, can travel freely from
state to state.
   The Europeans have drawn up a list of 285 steps that need to be
taken to remove physical, technical and fiscal obstacles to unity.
Their deadline for completing the task is the end of 1992. So far,
92 of the measures have been adopted.
   The 1992 pace has quickened dramatically since February when
European leaders agreed on measures to solve a long-standing
dispute over the trading bloc's budget. With their money woes
apparently out of the way, officials have turned their attention to
fashioning the single market.
   Many big U.S. companies with strong European ties do not expect
discriminatory moves against their operations but rather believe
they stand to gain when the barriers are removed.
   John Wells, external affairs manager at IBM's office in Paris,
cites such statements by EEC chief executive Jacques Delors as one
made in an interview with the International Herald Tribute of
Paris: ``Companies working inside the community will continue to be
welcomed. IBM conducts a share of its R&D (research and
development) in Europe. For us, IBM is a European company.''
   ``We feel zero threat,'' said Stephen Telegdy, director of
government affairs for Dow Chemical in Brussels. ``We feel we stand
to gain and have nothing to lose by the European integration,''
   Dow estimates the new Europe will mean savings of roughly $50
million annually from, among other things, lower transportation
costs, product standardization and simplification of accounting
procedures.
   But Reagan administration officials still voice concern about
Americans being kept out.
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Peter McPherson recently cautioned the
EEC, ``The creation of a single market that reserves `Europe for
Europeans' would be bad for Europe, for the United States and for
the multilateral economic system.''
   ``We would find unacceptable,'' he said in a speech in
Washington, ``measures that would limit market access for third
countries and discriminate against foreign companies already
established or that wish to establish in the community.''
   Stanley Crossick, senior partner of C&L Belmont, a
Brussels-based consulting firm that counts top U.S. companies among
its clients, said, ``To a major U.S. player well-prepared and
integrated in Europe, the opportunities appear to exceed the
threats.''
   But, he added, ``the Fortress Europe question is of serious
concern. We don't want to hype it up _ that's a danger. But it
could be a serious issue.''
   A key concern, analysts say, is the growing use of
``reciprocity'' in EEC discussions about how much access foreign
companies will have in sectors, such as financial services, not yet
covered by international trade rules.
   De Clercq said in recent speeches that the test of reciprocity
would be used when a foreign financial institution asks permission
to operate in an EEC country.
   The EEC, he said, ``will check on a case-by-case basis whether
similar institutions from all member states are given the same
treatment in the non-community country concerned.''
   ``If not,'' he continued, ``the authorization procedure will be
suspended until we have ensured reciprocity by negotiating with the
non-community country concerned.''
   Julian Oliver, vice president of corporate external affairs for
American Express in London, said the reciprocity issue could
disrupt the financial markets now operating efficiently in Europe.
   ``If the community tries to do a lockout,'' he said, ``they risk
cutting off their noses to spite their face.'' Foreign money, he
added, could be driven out of the community to offshore banking
centers.
   U.S. officials want the EEC to apply a standard of national
treatment to foreign firms so that U.S. banks and other operations
will be treated in the new market just like European companies.
   U.S. officials also are concerned the community will extend to
all 12 countries limits that a few have on imports of certain
products and that it will bow to protectionist demands from special
interests in fashioning commercial and industrial policies.
   ``This could result in new and greater discrimination in the
areas, for example, of right of establishment, mergers and
acquisitions, government procurement, subsidies, local content
requirements and standards and certification,'' said McPherson.

   Presidential race draws closer. Flashy,
computerized graphic at 11.
   American television viewers may not be sure how the presidential
candidates differ, but so what? With a quick glance at the set,
they'll know who's ahead in the polls.
   Television news, especially at the networks, has a fascination
with the horse race, not the horses. Polls and instant analysis
clobber in-depth issue reporting. ``It's easier and quicker to
deliver that kind of succinct information,'' said ABC political
analyst Jeff Greenfield.
   After all, there's only so much you can do in 5 minutes, about
the time the three networks spend each night on the campaign.
``What television does well is brief, telegenic episodes,'' said
columnist George Will. ``That's why television has traditionally
had difficulty delivering economic news _ because you can't take a
picture of supply and demand.''
   Television's inability _ or reluctance _ to delve into the
issues isn't new. But is it more of a problem this time around?
   For the first time in history, more than half of all Americans
depend on television as their single source of information,
according to the Television Information Office. In a campaign where
precise contrasts between Michael Dukakis and George Bush may be
difficult to grasp, are charts, graphs and 10-second sound bites
enough?
   Opinion, like the electorate, is split.
   ``It's not even a political campaign anymore, where political
issues are discussed and people analyze the issues,'' said Jeff
Cohen, director of the media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy
in Reporting. The coverage ``reduces us to mindless fans instead of
active citizens.''
   William Wheatley, executive producer of ``NBC Nightly News,''
disagrees. ``It's a long campaign, and with 4 to 6 minutes a night,
you can do a lot of reporting. It adds up,'' Wheatley said. ``I
don't think there's any doubt that the viewer gets enough
information and a good idea of where the candidates stand on the
issues.''
   Who decides how television covers the election? It's a tricky
question. Television viewers exhibit increasingly shorter attention
spans and, armed with remote controls, won't tolerate a moment of
boredom. Channels magazine reported in its September issue that a
majority of 18- to 34-year-old viewers with remotes in hand watch
two or more shows at once.
   ``You could certainly argue that if voters wanted to learn more
about issues, then `The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour' would beat out
Brokaw and Jennings and Rather,'' said Robert Lichter, co-director
of the Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``So a more
issue-oriented news presentation is available on PBS, but few
people take advantage of it. The mass of the public is not that
interested in issues.
   ``If the network research departments came up and said, `Wait a
second! There's a market for issues!' then you'd see more of that
coverage.''
   A recent Lichter study found that in 1,338 reports on this
year's primaries, the networks did almost three times as many
stories on campaign strategy and tactics _ the horse race _ than it
did on campaign issues _ the horses.
   ``For all practical purposes, voters are interested in
brevity,'' said Michael Robinson, an associate professor of
government at Georgetown University. ``They have always been
interested in brevity, and we have this romantic notion that at
some point the voters were really actively involved in the process.
They weren't.''
   ``Those people for whom television is 80 percent of their news
don't want the whole picture,'' said Will. ``Why are they watching
television? Because they are happy with that.''
   Television has traditionally been a reactive rather than a
proactive or anticipatory medium. Polls are news. Strategy sessions
are news. Gaffes are news. How Dukakis and Bush plan to deal with
the deficit ... well, that's something else.
   ``Even on `Nightline,' where we have much more time than on the
evening news, we're going to have a truncated discussion,'' said
ABC's Greenfield. ``On the evening news, you've got a minute-45 to
do each campaign. ... What you're going to cover is `here's what he
said' in 15 seconds. `Here's the latest poll. Here's their
strategy.'
   ``Given the incredible difficulty of covering coherently a
complicated policy debate, it is much easier to take what appears
to be a quantifiable fact ... and go to the latest poll.''

<HEAD>Peruvians Buy Hard Goods as Currency Loses Value</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With their currency losing ground rapidly in a
spiraling inflation, Peruvians are buying up refrigerators and
other durable goods not likely to lose value as fast as their paper
money, the inti.
   After two years of prosperity, Peruvians are seeing an economic
turnaround that is fueling the fastest increase in consumer prices
ever seen here.
   Independent economists conservatively estimate that inflation
will pass 500 percent this year. Two years ago inflation was 63
percent.
   ``The country is shipwrecked in a sea of paper money,'' said
Sen. Enrique Chirinos, an independent. ``This is a horrifying
perspective and never known before in our history.''
   Consumer prices shot up 30.9 percent in July alone.
   Peruvians are trying to adjust. They say they eat less, work
more and worry a lot.
   ``Now I have to buy less chicken. I use it first for broth and
then stew. It's the only way,'' said housewife Carmen Alegre, while
shopping in Lima's working-class La Aurora market.
   Nearby, tennis shoes costing 500 intis early last year were
selling for 3,000 intis, equivalent to about $25 or half the
minimum monthly wage.
   Cigarettes, often sold singly because many Peruvians cannot
afford entire packs, cost 10 intis each or seven times the January
price.
   Analysts are now concerned that Peru's inflation could boil into
four-digit figures next year.
   The middle class has begun renting spare rooms, tutoring,
knitting and sewing piece work and selling home-cooked food such as
meat-filled ``empanadas'' in streetside stands to make ends meet.
   But Peru's poor, the vast majority of the population, have been
affected the hardest.
   ``The poorest paid people in Peru are earning less money than at
any time since records have been kept,'' The Andean Report, an
economic monthly, said in July.
   An old man begging in the shadow of Lima's downtown government
palace complained recently that inflation was making him poorer.
   ``This fills up fast but the intis are worth nothing,'' he said,
jiggling the dirty plastic cup he waves to passers-by.
   Antonio Reyes, manager of an appliance store, said he telephones
wholesalers every day to get revised prices for the television
sets, stoves and toasters he sells.
   But business has been good, Reyes said, noting customers have
pulled cash from bank accounts where the annual interest is frozen
at 130 percent to buy durable goods, whose value very well could
rise in an inflation.
   ``The only option a saver has with his money is spend it,'' said
the news magazine Caretas. ``Those who do not have the ability to
save will simply have to seek a second job.''
   Guillermo Fernandez, 42, a married accountant with three
children, said he recently began moonlighting as a curbside money
trader on ``Wall Street,'' the name given by Peruvians to Jiron
Ocona, a narrow downtown street where thousands of people every day
now buy dollars as a hedge against inflation.
   He said many of his competitors are also professionals seeking
to supplement inflation-pinched incomes with the small but quick
profits offered by the dollar trade.
   Analysts say Jiron Ocona is also a financial barometer, and the
recent stampede for dollars reflects Peruvians' waning confidence
in the government's ability to improve economic conditions.
   In a recent survey, Peruvians rated the economy as the No. 1
problem, replacing a vicious leftist insurgency that was ranked
first a year ago.
   President Alan Garcia imposed a ceiling on foreign debt payments
on taking office three years ago and then used the money owed
creditors abroad to finance a consumption-based economic
reactivation that pulled Peru from its worst depression of the
century.
   But heavy government spending with an expected deficit of at
least 12 percent and a growing shortage of dollar reserves to
subsidize imports have plunged the nation into recession this year.
   Manufacturing has fallen sharply, while speculation in consumer
and industrial goods is rampant.
   Prosperity reflected by well-stocked stores two years ago has
now been replaced with repeated and prolonged shortages of
medicines, auto parts and basic foods, such as milk and sugar.
   Garcia, a populist whose term ends in 1990, recently installed a
``war economy,'' aimed at holding down wage increases while
allowing prices to rise.
   But economists maintain the measures are not sufficent and
predict inflation will continue to soar.
   ``When inflation hits 500 percent, it could very easily get out
of hand,'' said one leading independent economist, Alejandro Toledo.
   ``This is my biggest concern. There will be a very high social
cost and Peru is not a stable country.''

   Right across the Hudson River begins a world of
theater that Broadway rarely sees.
   For every ``Crimes of the Heart,'' ``'night, Mother,'' ``Big
River'' or ``Roza,'' there are scores of new plays, musicals and
revivals that rarely travel to New York.
   The following is a highly selective and subjective list of 10
promising theater productions that audiences beyond the Great White
Way will see during the 1988-89 theater season. A few of them might
make it to New York, but the name of the game is to provide lively
local theater rather than ready-made exports to Broadway. The
listings are in order of opening dates.
   1. ``The Grapes of Wrath''
   Steppenwolf Theater Company, the superstar of Chicago theater
troupes, has come up with a version of John Steinbeck's memorable
novel of the Depression. Frank Galati has adapted the book for the
stage and also directs. The cast includes such Steppenwolf regulars
as Gary Sinise and Terry Kinney as well as guest artist Lois Smith.
Performances: Sept. 18 through Oct. 30.
   2. ``The Habitation of Dragons''
   The Pittsburgh Public Theater has snared the world premiere of
the latest work by Horton Foote, playwright and screewriter of such
works as ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``Tender Mercies'' and ``The
Trip to Bountiful.'' Foote has made a career of chronicling the
lives of Texas families in such plays as ``The Widow Claire'' and
``Lily Dale.'' His latest effort is also set in the Lone Star State
and deals with loss, divided loyalities and forgiveness.
Performances are Sept. 20 through Oct. 23.
   3. ``Waiting for Godot''
   If you can't get tickets to the Robin Williams-Steve Martin
version of Samuel Beckett's absurdist comedy opening this fall at
Lincoln Center in New York, then try Denver. In its 400-seat Space
theater, the Denver Center Theater Company has come up with a
female version of ``Godot,'' starring Ann Guilbert and Kathleen
Brady-Garvin. Performances begin Sept. 26, and the production runs
through Nov. 5.
   4. ``On the Waterfront''
   Another great novel, this time by Budd Schulberg, will be put on
stage by the Cleveland Play House, now under the supervision of a
new artistic director, Josephine Abady. Miss Abady will also direct
the play which Schulberg and Stan Silverman have adapted for stage.
Grant Show, best known from the television soap opera ``Ryan's
Hope,'' plays Terry Malloy, the young ex-prizefighter who takes a
stand against a corrupt waterfront union. Performances: Oct. 18
through Nov. 20.
   5. ``Stone Wedding''
   Another world premiere, this time at the Los Angeles Theater
Center, an enterprising theater complex in the city's downtown
area. The play by Milcha Sanchez-Scott is set in a small town in
the American Southwest where black magic and supernatural forces
collide. ``Stone Wedding'' was commissioned by the center's Latino
Theater Lab. Performances: Nov. 23 thorugh Jan. 22, 1989.
   6. ``Pravda''
   Anthony Hopkins scored a huge personal success two years ago in
England in this savage satire by Howard Brenton and David Haire. He
offered a scathing portrait of a South African press baron who
rules London's Fleet Street. Now the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis
will present the play's American premiere. No word yet on who will
play Hopkins' role in Minnesota. Performances: Jan. 7, 1989 through
Feb. 5, 1989.
   7. ``Alfred Stieglitz Loves O'Keeffe''
   The relationship between two of this century's greatest artists
_ photographer Alfred Stieglitz and painter Georgia O'Keeffe _ is
explored in a play by Lanie Robertson, author of ``Lady Day at
Emerson's Bar and Grill,'' which examined the life of Billie
Holiday. Robertson's new play will be done at San Diego's Old Globe
Theater. Performances: Jan. 7, 1989 through Feb. 19, 1989.
   8. ``Golden Boy''
   In 1964, Sammy Davis starred on Broadway in a musical version of
Clifford Odets' play about a boxer and his conflicts with fame and
fortune. The unappreciated score is one of the best by Charles
Strouse and Lee Adams, the men behind the music for ``Bye Bye
Birdie.'' Now ``Golden Boy'' will be revived with a reworked book
by Leslie Lee. No word yet on who will play the leading role, but
the musical will be done at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Coconut
Grove, Fla. Performances: Jan. 17, 1989 through Feb. 12, 1989.
   9. ``Accomplice''
   Rupert Holmes scored on Broadway with his musical version of
Charles Dickens' ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood.'' Now he has written
what is being billed as ``a tantalizing thriller.'' The director is
Art Wolff. The play will be done at the newly revitalized Pasadena
Playhouse in California. Performances: Jan. 30, 1989 through March
1, 1989.
   10. ``Peer Gynt''
   Calling all Ibsen groupies to Connecticut. The Hartford Stage
Company plans a two-part, six-hour version of the playwright's
poetic parable of redemption through love. Richard Thomas stars as
Ibsen's egocentric hero. The director is Mark Lamos, the theater's
artistic director. The two men worked together last season at
Hartford on an imaginative version of ``Hamlet.'' The new Ibsen
translation is by Gerry Bamman and Irene Berman. Performances:
March 30, 1989 through May 20, 1989.

   NEW YORK _ Stringent security on the one hand and a trusting
openness on the other mark the dealing in New York's exotic Diamond
District. Barbara Mangiameli was an outsider who proved remarkably
successful in that environment _ until that day when she was
murdered and the $500,000 in diamonds she had been carrying
disappeared. It's a story worthy of a movie plot.

   In Manhattan's tradition-bound Diamond District,
Barbara Mangiameli was different _ a young Italian-American
Catholic woman in an industry dominated by Jewish men, an outsider
who went to school for the expertise more often passed down through
families.
   But it is not Barbara Mangiameli's success in the diamond
business that its denizens will remember.
   Mangiameli, 33, disappeared Feb. 4 along with more than $500,000
in diamonds, the day after a proposed sale fell through. In June,
her body was found in the Hudson River; she had been bludgeoned to
death. Only one of the six missing jewels has been recovered.
   ``She was just an innocent victim,'' says Laura Hruska,
executive director of the Diamond & Jewelry Association Inc. ``The
lesson that has to be learned from this is that ... you have to
take care of yourself, you have to take every precaution.''
   Aside from Mangiameli's death, there have been three other
murders this year in the block of midtown bounded by 46th and 47th
streets and Fifth and Sixth avenues, which is the Diamond
District's heart. That's high for a business area, says a detective.
   A walk down 47th Street, where gold-filled windows front onto
rooms crowded with jewelry-laden counters, suggests the business's
inherent risk: Gems are easily portable, readily negotiable, highly
valuable things. Danger, says one dealer, is ``an occupational
hazard.''
   But some say something is wrong when a young, relatively
inexperienced, unprotected woman is allowed to carry half a million
dollars worth of jewels to an unknown prospective buyer. As is
customary in the industry, Mangiameli only had to sign memos to
receive the diamonds on consignment from a broker with whom she'd
done business before.
   ``This was an enormous deal and way beyond Barbara's league,''
says Debra Shapiro, Mangiameli's friend from childhood. ``If things
aren't changed it can happen again and it will happen again.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island, Mangiameli earned a
two-year associate's degree in business and went to work in
advertising for more than seven years. Slim, athletic, with long
dark brown hair, she is remembered by friends and associates as
sincere, kind, family-oriented.
   In 1986, she decided to go into the jewelry business.
   ``She was always interested in things like archaeology and gems
and stones and physics,'' Shapiro says.
   Mangiameli started out selling what are called ``findings'' _
jewelry parts and raw metal. When her interest turned to diamonds
she entered the Gemological Institute of America in June 1987, to
learn what are known in the trade as the four C's _ color, clarity,
carat weight and cut. She emerged an accredited expert in the
quality of diamonds and other precious stones.
   She had met a broker, Charles Fischler, who says he became her
``mentor in the diamond business.'' He describes her as a woman of
``simple elegance,'' one who wore little makeup or jewelry. Her
eye, he says, was on the top.
   If so, she was in the right place: Last year, 80 percent of the
$3.4 billion in non-industrial diamonds that entered the United
States came into New York.
   Much of the actual diamond dealing is conducted in secure
offices or in bourses like the Diamond Dealers Club on West 47th
Street. There, amid high-tech security and state-of-the-art
business conveniences backed by three computer systems, men in long
beards lean across narrow tables littered with pieces of white
waxed paper. Tweezers in hand and loupe to eye, they trade tiny
crystals potentially worth millions of dollars.
   It is a business based in trust. Deals are sealed and stones
change hands on just a handshake and the words ``mazel and brucha''
_ Yiddish for ``luck and blessing.'' A date of payment is agreed
upon, a memo is signed. Should one side renege, the dispute goes to
the club's arbitration.
   Though she started out in sales, and earned money doing
free-lance deals during and after her student days, Mangiameli
apparently decided she did not belong in this part of the industry.
When she disappeared, she had worked several times on a free-lance
basis verifying gems at Christie's, the auctioneers. She was also
interviewing for a full-time job in diamond merchandising at
Tiffany & Co.
   The women who do make their living dealing in the Diamond
District know well the rules of this exotic world, where some very
Orthodox men will put a stone on the counter for them to pick up,
rather than risk touching a woman to whom they aren't married.
   They are also well acquainted with its dangers.
   Barbara Laufer Shapiro, 35, runs the retail and wholesale
jewelry exchange started by her father. Two years ago, her husband,
Henry, 35, left the store to meet someone who owed him money. He
was carrying about $6,000 worth of jewelry, his wife said.
   Henry Shapiro's body was found in February 1987, in a Queens
swamp. He had been shot four times, in the head and chest.

   For most of Barbara Mangiameli's short time in the business, she
was not confronted by the dangers. While in school, she began to do
free-lance sales, first of finished jewelry, later of actual gems.
   As time went on, Fischler said, she began to ask for larger and
more important stones for clients. She continued to free-lance
after graduating in December, and on Feb. 1, Fischler says,
Mangiameli called and said she had a prospective buyer for
investment-quality diamonds.
   At about 5:30 p.m. on Feb. 3, Fischler says, he put Mangiameli
in a taxi. She was to deliver an engagement ring to a customer at 6
p.m. and then meet a diplomat from a Third World nation who was
supposedly interested in the diamonds.
   The meeting had been arranged through two Italian brothers who
were friends of Mangiameli's. Fischler says she didn't seem overly
excited. He had given her stones worth as much as $250,000 before.
   When he'd heard nothing by midnight, Fischler said, he called
Mangiameli's apartment and she told him the meeting had been
canceled at the last minute. Fischler and Mangiameli agreed to meet
at noon the next day, when she would return the diamonds and hand
over $3,500 from the sale of the engagement ring.
   She called an associate of the broker's around 11:30 a.m. and
said she was on her way. She was last reported seen shortly after
noon in the vestibule of her Upper East Side building.
   No one has been charged in Mangiameli's death or the theft of
the diamonds.
   But authorities say the brothers, Fausto and Raoul Rivalta, were
arrested on April 11 and charged with interstate transportation of
stolen property _ one of the stones _ and are suspects in
Mangiameli's disappearance.
   When Mangiameli's body was found June 9, the medical examiner's
office said she had not been dead for very long, ``certainly ...
not months.'' But that estimate later was rescinded because of the
water temperature and other variables, according to office
spokeswoman Ellen Borakove.
   Now, Borakove says, ``We're still not prepared to give any
information out on the timing of the death.''
   The Rivaltas have been held without bail since their arrest and
face trial Sept. 26 in Manhattan federal court.
   The federal complaint against the pair alleges that two weeks
after Mangiameli disappeared, Fausto Rivalta sold a pear-shaped
diamond at a Florida pawnshop for $14,000. An appraiser identified
it as one of the six missing gems.
   Both brothers gave separate videotaped statements to the
Manhattan district attorney's office in March saying they did not
buy diamonds shown to them on Feb. 2 by Mangiameli.
   Debra Shapiro says that Fausto _ who lived in the same apartment
building as Mangiameli _ described himself as an interior designer.
Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Gilmore Childers says that at the time
of his arrest, Fausto, 33, was on probation on a burglary charge in
New York and had been arrested several times in Italy, mostly for
``theft-related'' crimes.
   Shapiro and Fischler say they never met Raoul Rivalta, whom
Mangiameli described to Fischler as a vice president of the
brokerage Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. In an affidavit dated April 28,
Raoul, 48, described himself as ``on leave of absence'' from the
firm.
   But the company's personnel director, Steve Lacoff, said Raoul
started as a security guard in April 1984 and worked his way up to
the post of clerk in the international operations department. He
said he was fired Feb. 26 for failing to return from vacation.
   Some people in the Diamond District say Mangiameli was wrong to
carry diamonds to meet someone she didn't know. Yet many dealers
and brokers carry jewels around, and danger is widely regarded as
inevitable in a business that deals daily in some of the world's
most precious objects.
   The district contains a heavy presence of uniformed and
undercover police and private security guards, but it isn't always
enough. Recent deaths include that of a man who was thrown to the
ground and struck his head on the sidewalk during a mugging in June.
   At one end of the spectrum are Colombian criminals who squirt
their prey with ketchup and commit robbery while the hapless victim
is trying to clean it up. ``Sometimes they end up with $100,000
score and sometimes they end up with someone's lunch,'' says
Detective James Kennedy of the Midtown North Precinct.
   Then there are the Soviet emigres who work a more sophisticated
con, finding it easier to set up a deal and get a foot inside the
door of a jewelry business than ``the average black kid from
Brooklyn,'' he says.
   In such an environment, it can take just one mistake to become a
casualty. Fischler says Mangiameli was ``smart, maybe a little
naive and that's why she got conned. But nobody's perfect.''
   In the Diamond District, danger ``is an occupational hazard in
the sense that there'll always be someone who'll try and put a scam
on you,'' says Henry Shapiro's widow, Barbara. She too carries
jewels _ and takes a different route home every night.
   But, she says, ``you can't go to work every day thinking that
someone is out to kill you, because then you may as well just stay
in bed.''

   Scaling sheer cliffs, sometimes blindfolded, is
not every executive's idea of a good time. But adventure training,
which matured into a big business in the economic expansion of the
1980s, is here to stay. Outward Bound challenges managers to test
themselves by taming the wilderness on five continents, and dozens
of competing programs are offering variations on the adventure
theme.

   In the cold pre-dawn light of the
Rockies, a dozen executives of the Champion Spark Plug Co. shiver
into jogging gear.
   They wheeze through a 20-minute run on a winding pine-forest
trail, reluctantly plunge half-naked into a rushing mountain
stream, and then head off to climb some rocks.
   It's all in a day's work at the Colorado Outward Bound School,
where hard-charging managers learn teamwork in the wild.
   Over the next five days, the spark-plug executives would
discover gears they never knew they had. Among their daily feats,
they clawed up a 70-foot cliff blindfolded and scaled a 13,000-foot
peak, posing for photographs at the summit like an Everest assault
team.
   ``In a couple of days I'll be back in the office saying, `Wow,
did I do all that stuff?''' says Jerry L. Brasiola, manager of
Champion's international manufacturing operations.
   The executives were sent to Outward Bound as an experiment by
Champion, one of a growing number of companies introducing
adventure into management training to build camaraderie and
cultivate leadership.
   Having come of age in the long economic expansion of the 1980s,
executive training camps have themselves become a growth industry
with scores of programs attracting thousands of corporate customers.
   No longer dismissed as a passing fad, the programs have become
standard operating procedure for many companies.
   Part of the idea is to confound, surprise, shock and scare
managers into breaching preconceived limits and thinking about new
ways of doing things. The programs often are a mixture of seminars,
scout camp, serious self-reflection and good-natured jokes about
sore muscles.
   ``We'll give you just enough advance warning about what you'll
do, so you won't spend a lot of time worrying about it,'' the
Champion group was told by Stephen McCormick, head of Colorado
Outward Bound's Professional Development Program.
   The training partly reflects a shift in what companies are
seeking in a leader. They still want scrappy soldiers who aren't
afraid to brawl with rivals to achieve success. But they also want
people with compassion, humility, vision and willingness to manage
by consensus, not edict.
   Though its heyday arrived only recently, adventure education has
been around since Outward Bound first trained British sailors to
withstand the ordeal of German U-boat attacks in World War II.
   Today, the school offers courses in wilderness settings on five
continents, from Himalayan mountaineering to sailing off the coast
of Maine.
   Outward Bound remains by far the largest adventure trainer among
at least 70 competing programs. Enrollment has nearly doubled to
more than 4,000 men and women annually over the past few years,
according to Donna Thompson, spokeswoman for Outward Bound USA
national headquarters in Greenwich, Conn.
   Clients range from giants like General Electric Co. to
entrepreneurs in the pizza business, which pay anywhere from $150
to more than $300 a day to throw people into physical challenges
they've never faced before.
   ``Most people at these events will say, `I can't do that.' And
most people don't want to try because it scares the hell out of
them,'' says Roy Yamahiro, a Federal Express Corp. vice president
who helped design the Colorado Outward Bound corporate program.
   ``It's the worst thing that can happen in life and business,''
he says. ``If you're fearful of taking risks, your whole life is
limited. That, in a simplistic way, is what Outward Bound does. The
wilderness is a classroom for coming face to face with conquering
things you can't do.''
   But some critics contend adventure training can be
counterproductive and hurt morale, especially among workers who may
be physically disabled.
   Others say most adventure trainers have no hard-core business
acumen and don't understand the reality of the work place. A few
wonder how climbing rocks or dangling from ropes will translate
into higher productivity and profits.
   ``My sense is that it's a beginning, a first step,'' says Warren
Bennis, professor of management at the University of South
California. ``How do you re-create that same environment within the
company? That's the real issue. Unless the environment is
supportive and compatible with the kind of lessons you learn in
outdoor education, it can have a backlash or even lower morale.''
   Ironically, part of the backlash may be a function of the
programs' popularity. They have become so ingrained in some
corporate cultures, the thrill of participation seems to have worn
thin. In the Champion group, for example, some participants balked
at quitting cigarettes, complained about the alcohol ban and vowed
to gorge themselves on steak and liquor when it was over.
   Others grumbled about the hard bunks in the school's Leadville
base camp, the early-morning jogs and bone-chilling dip in the
stream, which instructors cheerfully describe as an Outward Bound
tradition.
   Still, at the end of the Champion course, many members of the
group said they had enjoyed it despite blistered feet and altitude
headaches from the thin mountain air. A few had second thoughts.
   ``It depends on the people,'' says Kjell Karlsen, 30-year-old
chief of Champion's European financial operations. ``You could have
a 300-pound manager who works great in the office. But if you stuck
him out here, you'd kill him.''
   Although accidents are rare, outdoor corporate training programs
strictly enforce safety, partly because of tragedies that have
befallen executives who venture into the wilderness on their own.
   In late July, the chief executive officer of New England
Electric System was struck and killed by lightning while
peak-climbing with his wife in Aspen, Colo. About a year ago, five
advertising executives died in a white-water rafting accident in
British Columbia.
   Anyone over age 45 on an Outward Bound course needs a doctor's
permission to participate. Climbers must wear helmets. The school's
rule No. 1 for peak expeditions: Quit in a thunderstorm and head
below timberline.

   Many companies have found staff resistance to such programs
fades when participants discover the joys of conquering physical
challenges. Those feelings are carried back to the job and often
have a profoundly positive impact.
   Thomas Bruggerre, head of Mentor Graphics Corp., a computer
concern in Beaverton, Ore., decided last year to enroll himself and
17 subordinates in an Outward Bound rafting expedition down the
Rogue River in southern Oregon. He said his goal was to strengthen
manager relationships within the rapidly expanding company.
   ``I legislated that we were going to do it,'' says Bruggerre,
42. ``No one else wanted to. We had people who had never slept
outside before. Their idea of roughing it was checking into the
Maui Hyatt Regency without a reservation.''
   After a few days, the reticence disappeared. Bruggerre says the
catalyst was an exercise in which everybody slid down a sheer cliff
on a rope.
   ``When people got through that, it really lifted their
confidence and experience,'' he says.
   There are some failures. When a large soda bottler retained
Outward Bound to help it absorb managers of a newly acquired
subsidiary, many participants simply followed orders from the
highest-ranking member of their group, a senior vice president who
was to be their new boss.
   ``The dynamics don't work sometimes,'' says an Outward Bound
instructor who had helped teach that course, speaking privately.
``This guy was just so autocratic, everybody else was afraid of
him.''
   Despite Outward Bound's pre-eminence, criticism of its rigid,
spartan philosophy has helped engender the competition. Some rivals
claim to offer more flexibility, soft beds instead of sleeping
bags, filet mignon instead of freeze-dried soup.
   One example is Atlanta-based Executive Adventure Inc., founded
about six years ago by Robert Carr, a 38-year-old former head of an
insurance concern who had attended a 15-day Outward Bound course.
Sites for Executive Adventure courses range from the Blue Ridge
Mountains to Florida's Amelia Island resorts.
   About 175 companies have contracted with Executive Adventure for
outdoor-based executive training, including Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Wheat First Securities, Days Inns of America Inc. and Domino's
Pizza.
   ``The physical nature of our program is such that 99 percent of
the people can do what we do,'' says James D. Hickey, Executive
Adventure's sales and marketing director.
   ``We've had groups filled with macho guys who want everything we
can throw at them, including rope courses and rock climbing,''
Hickey says. ``On the other hand, we have some groups who say,
`We're only going to be with you for a day, we don't want to
sweat.' That's fine, too.''
   Executive Ventures Group, a Denver-based consulting concern
formed by five former Outward Bound instructors, offers companies
the option of sending people to its rustic Colorado Springs ranch
or bringing courses to them by setting up outdoor activities on the
lawn.
   Founded a few years ago, Executive Ventures has attracted
clients that include American Cyanamid Co., Arthur Young & Co. and
Citicorp Diners Club.
   Outward Bound officials admit their strict policies have driven
potential clients elsewhere. They have turned away company
executives who reject its alcohol prohibition or want to play golf
in the afternoon.
   ``There are people who consistently come and say, `Isn't there
any way we could do Outward Bound and still stay in a resort?,'''
McCormick says. ``What makes us special is that it isn't an
ordinary event. The one cardinal sin for Outward Bound would be if
it were ordinary.''
   On the other extreme, some adventure trainers pride themselves
on offering even tougher programs. The most stressful appears to be
Hell Camp, a U.S. affiliate of a famous Japanese management
institute, Kanrisha Yosei Gakko.
   Based at the Calamigos Ranch conference center near Malibu,
Calif., the 13-day, $2,480 Hell Camp course has been described as a
mix of Marine drill training and samurai warrior school for
managers.
   Instructors require students to complete a 25-mile night hike
with a misleading map, shout slogans by rote and croon a memorized
song about salesmanship in a public place to crush their
inhibitions.
   ``This is where it ties into the samurai, by promoting the most
alert, highly skilled and efficient,'' says Teresa L. Abass, a Hell
Camp graduate and sales representative. ``If a person acquired
these characteristics, they'd be pretty formidable. They could not
be conquered.''
   But despite newspaper advertisements and considerable publicity,
Hell Camp has not attracted significant corporate interest. Most
students are small-business managers or independent salespeople,
Ms. Abass says, acknowledging that ``our marketing is not right.''
   Many corporate users of adventure-training consultants have been
so pleased they've created in-house programs. Federal Express, for
example, has established its own school in Logan, Utah, similar to
Outward Bound.
   General Electric, an Outward Bound client for the past three
years, has adopted some of the school's methods in its executive
education center in Ossining, N.Y. The company still frequently
sends managers to Outward Bound's three-day sailing courses on
Hurricane Island, Maine.
   Nevertheless, there are no significant studies yet on the
long-term effects of adventure training. Some management
specialists say it's too early to draw conclusions.
   ``There are zippo evaluations today because they're so new,''
says Denise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior at
Northwestern University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of
Management.
   Even without proven results, supporters of these programs say
they are here to stay. Moreover, they say the relatively modest
cost makes them less vulnerable to corporate cutbacks in times of
recession.
   ``In my judgment, the smarter, more visionary companies would
abandon Outward Bound or a similar program only as a last-ditch
measure,'' says Arthur Levitt, chairman of the American Stock
Exchange and an Outward Bound alumnus. ``Better-managed companies
now recognize this as an essential tool.''

   When Pittsburgh Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri died
May 6 of a rare disease, City Council President Sophie Masloff
assumed the office. The 70-year-old grandmother projects the image
of a kindly old lady, but as one observer of the Pittsburgh
political scene says, ``Underneath there is a kind of toughness
that occasionally surfaces.''

   Sophie Masloff, Pittsburgh's first female
mayor, describes herself as an ``old Jewish grandmother'' and is
known to push her homemade chicken soup and cookies on visitors to
her house.
   Despite Pittsburgh's hardball ethnic politics, she refuses to be
one of the boys.
   ``The average ethnic man doesn't believe that women have
anything on the ball,'' says Mrs. Masloff, 70, a Democratic
loyalist for 50 years and a councilwoman for 12. ``Now they're all
watching me. They're watching this old Jewish grandmother and
everything I do. I'm going to be suspect.''
   As president of the City Council, next in line to succeed the
mayor, she was sworn in May 6, hours after Richard S. Caliguiri,
one of the city's most popular mayors, died of a rare disease at
the age of 56.
   She promptly announced she would report to the mayor's office by
8 a.m. every day, except Tuesdays, when ``I get my hair done.''
   She wasn't kidding. For 20 years, the same hairdresser has
styled Mrs. Masloff's hair every Tuesday at 6:30 a.m. at a downtown
department store.
   One of her first acts as mayor was to demand that several
neighborhoods be spruced up, saying the housewife in her saw the
need for spring cleaning.
   ``My friends all say, `That's enough of this old Jewish
grandmother bit.' But it's a fact,'' she says. ``I am a grandmother
and I am a housewife, too. I can't say I'm a 35-year-old hotshot.
This is what I am and I just feel that I should acknowledge it
right at the start.''
   She also acknowledges holding some old-world superstitions.
   Last January, for example, with city hall abuzz about
Caliguiri's ill-health and the forthcoming council president
selection, Mrs. Masloff said that amid the political intrigue she
was concerned about ``Kay nan horre,'' or ``the evil eye'' as
loosely translated from Yiddish.
   ``I fear for a black cat and I don't walk under a ladder,'' she
says. ``The old folks believed in the evil eye, and while I don't
altogether believe it, I don't altogether not believe it.''
   Mrs. Masloff said some aides feel she would command more respect
if more people would just call her mayor.
   ``I'm Sophie to everybody,'' she says. ``Nobody says `mayor' and
nobody says `Mrs.'''
   Government by Jewish grandmother may be an asset, says Michael
Webber, Duquesne University professor of urban history and a
specialist on Pittsburgh politics.
   ``She's projecting this image that she has of this sort of
kindly old lady, but I think that underneath there is a kind of
toughness that occasionally surfaces,'' he says.
   But Councilwoman Michelle Madoff, one of Mrs. Masloff's most
vocal critics and a political opponent, says the mayor's image
hurts women and the city.
   On a recent talk show, Mrs. Masloff said that if she ever met
British industrialist Brian Beazer, who was launching a hostile bid
for Pittsburgh-based Koppers Co., she would ``scratch his eyes
out.''
   ``What does it do for the image of women when she says, `I'm
going to scratch his eyes out?''' Mrs. Madoff asks. ``She went on
and ranted and raved. She set the women's movement back 50 years.''
   Mrs. Masloff later said she was joking when she made the remark,
but Mrs. Madoff says the incident was just one of many gaffes made
by the mayor.
   The mayor chose the theme ``Sophie's Choice'' for an anti-litter
campaign, saying the slogan was just a catch phrase when critics
familiar with the novel and the movie of the same name said the
theme was in poor taste. The book told the story of a Polish woman
forced by Nazis to choose which of her two children would be killed.
   Mrs. Masloff says bringing cable television to the city was her
greatest achievement as a councilwoman. Mrs. Madoff says the mayor
accomplished little else and rose through the ranks mostly because
she followed party dictates without question.
   The mayor's supporters say Mrs. Masloff's loyalty to her
constituents is her strength.
   ``She goes out of her way to help a lot of people,'' says Rita
Wilson Kane, Allegheny County's Register of Wills. ``No matter what
anyone calls about in her office, she works on every little thing
that people ask her to do.''
   Mrs. Madoff announced Sept. 6 that she would run for mayor. Mrs.
Masloff will be mayor until Caliguiri's term expires in January
1990 and she expects to enter the race, although she has not yet
made a formal announcement.
   Mrs. Madoff, 60, says the similarity between their last names
has benefited both at election time.
   ``She gets elected and I get elected on each other's votes,''
Mrs. Madoff says. ``Every time I'm not running, people say, `Honey,
I voted for you.' ''
   As mayor, Mrs. Masloff has adopted Caliguiri's top priorities of
cutting the city's 4 percent wage tax and advancing Pittsburgh's
transformation from a steelmaking center to a corporate and
service-oriented city.
   She says it has been difficult to follow Caliguiri, a friend and
a political mentor.
   ``He was such a popular mayor,'' she says. ``People expect me to
be just like him and that's almost impossible. I'm hoping that when
I walk out of here I'll leave behind the same kind of city that
Caliguiri left.''
   The mayor and her husband, Jack, have been married more than 40
years and have a daughter, Linda, who has two children.
   The youngest of four children of Romanian immigrants, the former
Sophie Freeman grew up in a tenement in the city's Hill District
during the Depression.
   When she was 16 she graduated from high school and got a job,
taking free college courses at night ``wherever and whenever'' she
could. About that time, she joined the Young Democrats, along with
Mrs. Kane.
   Mrs. Masloff later worked in the Allegheny County Commission
office, and then in the county court as a tipstaff, an investigator
and an assistant chief clerk. She also served as president of the
Pennsylvania Democratic Federation of Women.
   She won a seat on the City Council in 1976 in a special election
and was re-elected in 1977, 1981 and 1985, leading the ballot the
last two times.

   The children all suffer from one handicap or
another, but their compassion is unimpaired. Their friend is dying.
That was all they needed to know to want to make his remaining days
more livable, and it is a question who inspires whom the most.

   Deep in thought, the dying man gazes
across the green fields behind his trailer house. The only sounds
are those of summer birds and several puppies yapping in a nearby
pen, ignoring the pair of black bears pacing in their steel
enclosure.
   Immobile in his wheelchair, Mike Aria takes a deep breath,
causing the weakened muscles of his neck to bulge slightly. It
takes all his strength just to talk, so he chooses his words
carefully.
   Aria, a 38-year-old former animal trainer, is dying of ALS _
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gehrig's Disease.
   ``Even if I feel completely down in the morning, when I see the
kids I'm animated. A load has been lifted off me,'' he says in
strained, slurred speech, a smile covering his face.
   The children Aria speaks of are 300 handicapped students at
Roosevelt Vocation School in Lake Wales, 16 miles south of this
rural community in central Florida.
   The 7th- through 12th-graders, explained Principal Harold
Maready, have learning disabilities, emotional problems, hearing
impairment or are mentally handicapped.
   What began as a student Christmas project in 1985 to help the
needy, Maready says, became a bond between these afflicted children
and Mike Aria.
   When they learned that Aria was paralyzed from the neck down and
dying and that he and his wife, Janice, and their 8-year-old
daughter, Amber, existed on $575 a month Social Security benefits,
they made a decision.
   ``After that Christmas, it was the kids' decision to keep it
going,'' Maready recalls. ``They turned it into an adoption.''
   Through cake and candy sales, car washes, auctions and
fund-raising, the handicapped children have provided Aria with a
motorized wheelchair and an electric page-turner to help him read.
   When they learned of Aria's love for nature, they laid pebble
trails for his wheelchair through his family's 10 acres of
greenery. Then they bought lumber and built a ramp so he could
manipulate his wheelchair in and out of his trailer house. Last
year they built an outside bathroom and shower, making it easier
for his wife to help Aria bathe.
   ``He's one of my friends,'' said one of the providers, Donna
Ellzey, 18, a senior from Bartow who visited Aria on vacation. ``I
feel I've done something real good for somebody when I help him.''
   Another way she helps is by writing a newsletter to keep
Roosevelt students informed of Aria's activities.
   ``He gives us so much in return by letting these kids be part of
his life,'' Maready says. ``Mike teaches the kids that they have
something to give the world.''
   Mike and Janice, both from New Jersey, were high school
sweethearts.
   In her senior year at New York University, Janice took an
independent study course at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey's
Circus's clown school in Venice, Fla. Though joining the circus was
never an original goal, she soon became a featured performer.
   After college, Mike, an athletic 210-pounder, joined her and
took up training wild animals _ bears, elephants, leopards, lions.
They were married in 1974.
   In 1978, Mrs. Aria's brother, Gil Gillespie, left his job as a
schoolteacher and the three of them formed their own act, using
North American black bears, and went on tour.
   In 1983, Aria began to experience an occasional slurring of
speech. Then, the strength in his hands deteriorated.
   ``That December, they told us Mike had a motor neuron disease
causing the muscles to atrophy,'' his wife says. ``There's no known
cause or cure.''
   The following year paralysis consumed Aria's body and their
circus careers came to an end. With two favorite bears and a number
of dogs from their act, they moved here. Gillespie lives in a small
trailer in back, works in the area as a stage artist and helps
support the Aria family.
   Mrs. Aria provides constant care. To visitors, they appear as
young lovers.
   ``We were so right to run away and join the circus,'' she
reflects. ``It was a romantic kind of thing to do.''
   Amber, their daughter, studied art and sculpture in college and
a couple of years ago persuaded her father to take up painting. She
had seen him use a pencil held in his mouth to change television
stations. ``If you can do that, why not try painting?'' she asked.
   So far, he has illustrated two calendars, which provide a little
extra income.
   Aria is well aware that ALS is usually terminal after five years.
   ``Right now, I'm living on borrowed time,'' he said with
equanimity, ``but I have my wife, daughter, brother-in-law _ and
the kids.
   ``Those children reinforce me. They give me more things to be
thankful for.''
   Aria pauses to find new energy for a personal observation.
   ``Life threw me a curve ball. I think I ought to stand in the
batter's box and try to hit it.''

   Wolves get a bad rap, says a California woman
who owns three of the animals, but don't get any ideas about
keeping one in your house. That's the advice from Deborah Warrick,
a former professional roller skater and amateur sky diver, who
publishes a magazine for wolf fans. Among her other endeavors in
behalf of wolves, she says, she's a contestant in a men's
magazine's centerfold contest.

   Her friends call her ``the wolf woman.''
She's an animal rights activist with a taste for adventure and a
yen to be a centerfold.
   Deborah Warrick, who now publishes her own magazine devoted to
her favorite canines, cringes every time she hears nursery rhymes
like ``The Three Little Pigs,'' ``Little Red Riding Hood'' and
``Peter and the Wolf.''
   Such tales, she says, wrongly portray wolves as ravenous beasts
that prey on little children, as in a passage from the famous Grimm
Brothers fairy tale:
   ``When she got to the wood, she met a wolf; but Red Riding Hood
did not know what a wicked animal he was...
   ``The wolf thought: `This tender little creature will be a plump
morsel.'''
   ``Kids are raised fearing wolves and they grow up not caring if
they are killed,'' says Ms. Warrick, who owns three wolves and this
year began publishing a magazine called ``Wolves and Related
Canids.''
   Not all popular wolf stories put the animal in a bad light, Ms.
Warrick says, citing the Disney films ``Never Cry Wolf'' and ``The
Adventures of Natty Gann.''
   But the animals have traditionally had a bad reputation. They
were virtually wiped out in the early part of this century in the
United States and only now are being reintroduced into the wild.
   However, Ms. Warrick describes them as basically timid,
opportunistic animals that go for the easiest kill.
   ``I'd be more afraid of a pit bull or a German shepherd,'' she
says.
   Ms. Warrick, 33, became interested in wild animals at an early
age.
   ``I've always been into exotics,'' she says. ``My parents always
encouraged that sort of thing and we had pet rattlesnakes and
raccoons _ even an 8-foot python.''
   She is no stranger to adventure. Besides nursing exotic reptiles
and other wildlife back to health, she started an advertising
agency, was an investment counselor, performed in professional
roller-skating shows and was a sky diver until a near-fatal
accident.
   She also was chosen recently as one of 100 contestants in
Playboy magazine's 35th anniversary Playmate search.
   Ms. Warrick hopes to win the $35,000 in prize money, which she
says will go toward her efforts in behalf of wolves.
   Seven years ago, Ms. Warrick, who lives in the San Fernando
Valley and now sells 3-D computer graphic systems to the aerospace
industry, was given her first wolf cub.
   ``That's when I realized just how intelligent they are,'' she
says, noting that a wolf's brain is 30 percent larger than that of
a similar-sized dog.
   She got around a California law that prohibits people from
keeping purebred wolves as pets by registering them as dogs. But
wolves, she says, are not for everyone.
   In fact, Ms. Warrick uses the magazine to discourage people from
attempting to raise wolves at home. Too often, they get into the
wrong hands and either end up put to sleep or in a wolf sanctuary.
   ``They don't make good pets. They are a pack animal and will not
become your house pet,'' she says. ``If they accept you, you become
a part of their pack and must abide by pack rules.''
   Ms. Warrick's three Alaskan tundra wolves, Awesome, Nova and
Tundra, are kept in Northern California and Colorado because her
Woodland Hills home has too little space for them.
   The wolves must be kept outdoors. In the wild, they dig dens,
clearing away twigs, rocks and other obstacles to protect their
cubs.
   ``In a house, they'll automatically think it's their den and
they'll pull up the carpeting and drapes to make it safe,'' Ms.
Warrick says. ``You can't yell at them or strike them because
you'll lose your bond. A dog comes back for more, but a wolf
won't.''
   The magazine, which averages 65 pages, is published every other
month from Ms. Warrick's home. It evolved from hundreds of
documents sent to her from wolf biologists in such places as
Minnesota and Canada. A frequent contributor, David Mech, is
spending the summer on Canada's Ellesmere Island studying arctic
wolves.
   ``It became such a waste to Xerox it all for the wolf owners I
know, that I decided to start the magazine,'' she says. Breeders
and dog food manufacturers advertise, and so far she has broken
even by doing the editing, typesetting, layout and some writing
herself.
   ``Wolves and Related Canids'' has 500 subscribers and continues
to grow. Ms. Warrick estimates there are at least 500 wolf or
hybrid wolf-dog owners in California alone.
   Articles on reintroducing wolves into the United States,
veterinary advice, features on wolf owners and lesser-known canids
make up the bulk of the magazine. Each issue also contains a
complete listing of wolf and wildlife organizations.
   From 1901 to 1930, the wolf population in the United States was
virtually wiped out. Ranchers called it predator control because
wolves were attacking their livestock.
   But Warrick says hunters and trappers competed with the wolves
for other predators, virtually eliminating the wolf's basic food
source.
   ``Wolves only kill diseased or weak animals,'' she says.
``They're too cowardly and not strong enough to kill the strong and
virile. It's a major misconception.''
   For wolf cubs to be raised in captivity, they must be placed
with owners before they are 10 days old.
   Ms. Warrick, who briefly studied veterinary medicine at the
University of California-Davis and took an animal keeper course at
the Los Angeles Zoo, bottle-fed her charges goat's milk every three
hours when they were infants. They now eat about five pounds of raw
meat daily.
   ``They are so loving,'' she says. ``When I go into their pen,
I'm overcome with licks and jumps. They knock me down and walk all
over me.''

   Many research groups are looking at the health
effects of smoking. But Harvard's unique Institute for the Study of
Smoking Behavior and Policy is also looking at other ways to
persuade some 55 million American smokers to quit, looking at the
deeper meaning of the habit.

   When smoker professors returned to their
offices two years ago for the fall semester at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, they discovered they had become
overnight victims of a coup d'ashtray.
   The school's own Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and
Policy had struck.
   Those who chose to puff away inside the buildings now were
forced to retreat to a small room, a smokers' purgatory with glass
walls and hard chairs.
   The small, wiry man behind it all, Professor Thomas Schelling,
himself a reformed smoker, was remorseful about the smoking
section. But not for long.
   ``I thought it was cruel and unusual punishment, but a student
said, `Don't be hasty. Because of it I gave up smoking and so did
my friend.'''
   Everyone knows smoking tobacco is unhealthy. But the way in
which a habit once considered sophisticated was transformed into a
taboo is the kind of social change Schelling, as director of the
Smoking Institute, wants to understand and harness.
   Schelling's mission? ``I want to help smokers,'' he says. By
this he means persuading the 55 million American smokers to stop.
   ``The original emphasis was on what can we find out about the
problem of quitting that will help people quit when they want to,''
says the 67-year-old economist and self-taught behaviorist. ``Now
we're focusing more on policy issues.''
   Schelling made a prediction: ``Smoking will disappear, slowly.
In 50 years people will still be smoking, but much less.''
   While other research groups examine the health effects of
smoking, Harvard's is thought to be the only one considering the
deeper meaning of the habit.
   ``There isn't anything like it anywhere else in the world,''
says Dr. Elena Nightingale, adviser to the Carnegie Foundation of
New York, a major institute sponsor.
   The idea of such an institute was born about six years ago, when
Schelling expressed fascination with the cessation of smoking since
World War II by scores of middle-class, middle-aged men. He
promoted meetings on the subject, convincing Harvard President
Derek Bok among others that a more ambitious effort was needed to
make any difference.
   Since it opened four years ago, this small, obscure research
center at Harvard University already has reached into more distant
halls than the smoke-free ones under its roof.
   Operating as a continuing forum, the institute is host to a
study group of 20 to 40 interested health, government and
psychological professionals who meet monthly to discuss and
exchange the latest research.
   In addition, at any given time some 15 assorted physicians,
psychiatrists, students of government policy, health workers,
sociologists and the like attached to the institute conduct
independent research. This could be anything from writing a social
history of smoking to studies on the effectiveness of hypnosis in
breaking tobacco addiction.
   The work of the institute is so compelling, for smokers
especially, that when a psychologist was running a study of smokers
at a Veterans Adminstration hospital, she asked that its name not
be published in a newspaper story about the institute. Publishing
the name in the past caused a rush of volunteers that inundated the
hospital.
   The purpose of the institute, on an annual budget of $600,000,
is to prompt outside research and then disseminate the results. In
the words of Executive Director John Pinney, a former
three-pack-a-day smoker and one-time chief of the federal office of
Smoking and Health: ``We set out to be a convenor and stimulator.''
   Some results:
   _Snuffing out much of the smoking culture in the U.S. military
in 1986 by contributing to then-Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger's decision to order aggressive anti-smoking efforts,
from the Pentagon to boot camp.
   _Helping persuade Congress in 1985 to keep the 16-cent federal
excise tax on cigarettes instead of halving it as planned.
   _Assisting foreign countries trying to resist U.S. tobacco
companies eager for new markets.
   _Finding in a study that found teen-agers, unlike adults, can
start and stop smoking many times, thus prompting health educators
to shift their approach from prevention to intervention.
   _Prompting smoking restrictions in Massachusetts government
office buildings and vehicles, after a chat Schelling had with Gov.
Michael Dukakis at a Harvard get-together.
   _Investigating life in a nearly smoke-free world through
pollsters who work in a laboratory in the city of Cambridge, which
last year instituted one of the country's toughest anti-smoking
laws.
   Once upon a time smoking was considered stylish. Tobacco
companies even claimed it offered health benefits.
   ``What we've seen in this country is just about the most
remarkable voluntary change in behavior anywhere,'' Schelling says.
   Institute researchers have tried to fathom this change and
smoking behavior especially. They are asking, for instance, why
some people never smoke and why others do despite knowing the
risks. And why is it that most people who try to quit can, but
hard-core smokers can't part from cigarettes no matter how hard
they try?
   The institute is also eager to know how to prevent teen-agers
from taking up smoking since there is evidence that smoking is
seldom begun past the age of 20.
   According to institute figures, there has been a steady decline
in smoking since the 1950s. In 1949, 44 percent of adults smoked.
In 1986, the latest available figures, the proportion of adult
smokers was 26.5 percent, institute figures show.
   Among people still smoking, most try to stop.
   Just four years ago, only a dozen major corporations restricted
smoking to avert fires and contamination of their products. Today
more than half the Fortune 500 companies limit smoking on the job.
   Chief among the influences on this sea change is that after
decades of concern about the life-shortening effects of smoking,
the office of the U.S. surgeon general in 1964 made the risks
official when it linked smoking to lung disease.
   Since then, Americans have become more self-conscious about
their health, taking up exercise and improving their diets with the
gusto of the Old World explorers searching for the Fountain of
Youth.
   It is not only concern for personal health that is crushing the
national smoking habit. Peer pressure has a lot to do with it.
   ``There is some moral opprobrium, the temperance notion that if
you have to smoke, you have to suffer,'' Schelling says.

   Tamayo Otsuki, a former topless dancer
who became a stand-up comic with a raunchy routine, is being seen
more and more on network television since she cleaned up her act.
   Otsuki, perhaps the only female Japanese comedian delivering
punch lines in English, will appear on NBC's ``The Comedy Store
15th Year Class Reunion'' on Oct. 13 and she was cast in ``Elysian
Fields,'' a CBS drama pilot that has yet to air.
   The 29-year-old Osaka native takes to the stage at the Dunes
Hotel here clad in a purple-striped kimono, blue and gold obi sash
and gold sandals. In soft, Japanese-accented English, she
introduces herself and tells the audience that her name translates
as ``Pearl Harbor.''
   Like much of her humor, the joke is partially true. Her first
name does mean ``Pearl.''
   She then moves to the end of World War II and startles the
audience by saying, ``Thank you very much for dropping bomb.''
   Otherwise, she says, there would have been no more Nissan and
Sony and she probably never would have been born.
   ``We really appreciate it,'' she says, smiling at the audience.
``But please don't do it again.''
   Later, backstage, Otsuki explains that she believes that the
atomic bombs detonated on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved many
Japanese and American lives by averting a bloody land invasion.
   While her routine is mostly rid of the profanity that spiced her
act at comedy clubs around Los Angeles, and later on the Playboy
Channel, she has drawn occasional criticism that her material is
racist, which she denies.
   ``I'm against this prejudice thing,'' she says, adding that she
wants to teach Americans to laugh with Japanese people instead of
at them.
   Onstage, she recounts the tale of her ``legendary'' grandfather,
the only surviving kamikaze pilot, ``Chicken'' Nakamura.
   When the audience seems uncomfortable laughing at the war jokes,
she defuses the situation by saying, ``Some people are looking at
me and thinking, `We should have killed them all.'''
   Otsuki, who now resides in Hollywood, says she picked up her
sense of humor from her roller coaster life that initially took her
from star high school pupil to college dropout to bar singer to
tour guide.
   She then moved to England and ended up as an admittedly
incompetent nanny for a wealthy family. The household eventually
fired Otsuki, but took such pity on her they gave her free room and
board.
   After that, it was on to America, where within three months she
was in a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. Soon, however, she
found herself wondering where her next meal would come from.
   So the 22-year-old woman took a job as a topless dancer in the
Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park.
   A visit to the Comedy Store several years later persuaded her to
change stages.
   ``After three years of dancing naked, I wanted to move on to a
better thing,'' she says.
   She became obsessed with becoming a comedian but she was
ill-prepared to make a living by delivering laughs.
   ``I didn't even know stand-up comedy existed,'' she says. ``I
didn't know what a punch line was.'' But she says she knew she
loved to make people laugh.
   Otsuki began at the bottom of the comedy profession, working for
free at comedy clubs in the Los Angeles area, delivering a crude
act which mostly consisted of ``cussing for three minutes with my
heavy, heavy accent. I was horrible.''
   At least, she recalls, Hugh Hefner liked it and had her deliver
the routine on the Playboy Channel.
   Over the years, Otsuki honed her act into a more sophisticated
routine peppered with comments on such current topics as the trade
friction between the United States and Japan.
   Today, the cursing barrage is gone, but ethnic groups, including
Asians, Jews and blacks, are targets of Otsuki's humor.
   For example, she tells her audiences that Americans are getting
shorter because they eat so much sushi and a diet among Japanese of
burgers and fried chicken is making them taller.
   ``One day we can play basketball together,'' goes the punch line.
   In addition to learning to play basketball, Japanese are
becoming more civilized, she says.
   ``You know hara-kiri? We finally realized it's stupid _ after
800 years.''

   Pianist-arranger Luther Henderson, one of the
members of the original cast back for a revival of ``Ain't
Misbehavin','' thinks the Fats Waller musical is even better than
when it opened 10 years ago.
   And that original production was good enough to lead to
successful Broadway revues of music by Eubie Blake (``Eubie'') and
Duke Ellington (``Sophisticated Ladies'').
   Other members of the original Broadway cast _ Nell Carter,
Armelia McQueen, Charlaine Woodard, Andre De Shields and Ken Page _
are at the Ambassador Theater, again singing songs that the late
composer-pianist-singer Fats Waller made into hits. Henderson sits
in for Waller at the upright piano.
   ``There have been many extraordinarily good casts,'' Henderson
says. ``But none of them generate the kind of electricity that this
group does. This show has taken on a deeper dimension. I don't know
if that's visible to everybody. The singers are doing the same
thing they did before and as great as it was, it seems to be better
now. I think I'm playing better now.
   ``What we were attempting, and I think we do, is to capture, be
custodians of and illuminate the spirit of Fats Waller,'' Henderson
says. ``We're not just giving lip service to songs like `T'ain't
Nobody's Biz-ness If I Do' and his saying, `One never know, do
one.' It's for fun.''
   One song, ``Black and Blue,'' isn't intended to be funny, but
sometimes the audience laughs as the song begins. The laughter
trails off as they realize it's serious.
   ``All of a sudden, Fats, who's telling everybody your feet's too
big and this man is fat and greasy and being the buffoon _ for
which he got a lot of flack in his lifetime _ decides to create a
very strong protest song,'' Henderson says. ``People have been
having such a good time they can't believe right away he's not
kidding.''
   ``Ain't Misbehavin''' has been touring, drawing audiences
steadily over 10 years, with different casts. Leonard Oxley and
Billy McDaniels, who've done the show often, currently play piano
on Tuesday nights and Wednesday matinees, when Henderson is off.
   Henderson confesses that he really doesn't play like Fats
Waller, ``except in certain things.''
   ``I use some of his stride piano idioms,'' he says. ``Stride is
`oom pah,' a rhythmic background effect, like a band. Fats was
exuberant and he showed it in his percussiveness. He was able to do
stride with his left hand and play other stuff up in the right hand.
   ``In the late 1930s and early 1940s the art of stride piano
playing, and boogie-woogie, were incredible. I can tell you they
are very difficult to do.''
   Henderson was hired as arranger when ``Ain't Misbehavin'''
started as a musical revue at the off-Broadway Manhattan Theater
Club. ``The orchestra is built around the piano,'' he says. ``Fats
never had a band. He called it Fats Waller and his rhythm. He used
a drummer, bassist and sometimes a guitarist.'' Later, Henderson
reluctantly agreed to play on-stage piano as well.
   Henderson, a Juilliard School graduate, decided early in life to
concentrate on arranging instead of composing or performing. He was
intimidated by the great jazz pianists then working. ``I always
tell people I was frightened by Art Tatum at an early age,'' he
says. ``Then Oscar Peterson came along.''
   He composed the music for an off-Broadway musical comedy,
``Crystal Tree.'' ``I'm not a bad composer,'' he says, ``but that's
something you can't do offhand. You have to do it every day; it's
not a part-time job.''
   When he arranges, Henderson says, he starts with pinning down
what is to be communicated. ``When I get a job like `Miss Teen
U.S.A.' for TV, I don't need to go into that depth. I just
generally do because that's how I got brought up. When I get these
gigs, I work twice as hard as anybody else.''
   Henderson recently arranged two albums, of Dixieland and
Gershwin music, for the Canadian Brass. ``There is nothing in those
two hours of music that is improvised and they say Dixieland should
be improvised.
   ``I think I was successful. It's the essence of what Dixieland
might have been if they'd all had the technique these boys have
got. I strive for that _ the essence _ a lot.''

<HEAD>Libya Pushes Gadhafi's Dream of Making a Desert Green</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Despite sagging oil revenues, Libya is
pushing ahead with Col. Moammar Gadhafi's dream of piping fresh
water from deep under the Sahara Desert to the shores of Tripoli
and other thirsty coastal areas.
   Gadhafi maintains his Great Manmade River Project will transform
a nation that is 95 percent desert into a ``Garden of Eden'' abloom
in fruits, vegetables and grain.
   One underpinning of the project is U.S. technology, reportedly
in place before January 1986, when the Reagan administration
ordered American companies to stop doing business in Libya on
grounds that Libyans were behind terrorism aimed at Americans and
other Westerners.
   Gadhafi, riding in a beat-up Range Rover behind Bedouins on
horses, came here Aug. 26, 1986, to inaugurate the factory that
makes the concrete-and-steel pipes for the ``river.'' Since then,
about 280 miles of the planned 12,500-mile pipeline have been laid
in a trench cut through sand and underlying rock.
   The first stage, estimated to cost $4.5 billion, calls for 1,180
miles of pipeline to carry half a billion gallons of fresh water
daily from wells in east central Libya to a reservoir at Ajdabiya
near the coast on the Gulf of Sidra for distribution to areas near
Sirte and Benghazi.
   In 1986, officials predicted the first stage would be completed
in 1989. But factory manager Osman Jaouda estimated recently it
would be finished in 1991.
   The South Korean construction company Dong-Ah is cranking out
the pipes and digging through the desert to lay them down. Jaouda
said the Koreans' inexperience with desert terrain and weather
caused the delay.
   ``It's not (a problem of) financing,'' said Jaouda.
   With current lower market prices, Libya's oil revenue is sharply
down from the boom years of the late 1970s and early '80s. In 1980,
oil revenue was $22 billion; by 1987, it had plunged to $6.6
billion.
   Diplomatic and business sources in Tripoli say Libya has cut
back drastically on such projects as highway, school and hospital
construction and is concentrating its resources on its oil
industry, the military and the Great Manmade River.
   ``Every single Libyan is waiting for water,'' Jaouda said,
leading a tour for foreign journalists flown on a government plane
from Tripoli to Benghazi to see the project.
   The pipeline's first part slices through bleak terrain, broken
only occasionally by brush and date palms near oases, where camels
and goats graze.
   Gadhafi comes to the desert frequently to check on progress,
Jaouda said.
   The U.S. order against American operations in Libya caused a few
hectic months without consultants but did not delay the project,
Jaouda claimed.
   The firm of Root and Brown Inc. of Houston, Texas, turned over
its duties to its subsidiary in England, and Britons and Canadians
have taken the place of the estimated 300 Americans who were
working on the project, Jaouda said.
   He added that the first water to flow will irrigate 247,000
acres of farmland near the Mediterranean city of Benghazi, Libya's
second largest city.
   Other stages call for water to be tapped from wells in central
west Libya and be delivered to Tripoli and for a pipeline to
connect the Libyan capital, Tripoli, with Sirte. Eventually a
pipeline is to run out to wells in Kufra, deep in the south, and
the final phase will pipe water as far east as Tobruk, near the
border with Egypt.
   Jaouda declined to give even the roughest estimate for
completion of the entire project but that contracts will be awarded
for stage two by the end of this year, a few months behind an
earlier timetable.
   Businessmen and technicians here, including those who have
worked on irrigation projects, express doubts that the project will
guarantee that Libya can grow all it needs to eat.
   They cite the competing demands by major cities, where most of
Libya's population lives, for more and better drinking water. They
predict political pressures will dictate that more and more water
transported by the pipeline will be diverted from agricultural to
urban use.
   They also say that the project is counting on enthusiastic
cooperation from farmers to see that the irrigated land is most
efficiently farmed. But they add that state cooperative farms
generally yield much less than possible because the workers won't
make any more profit if they work harder or better.
   As an example, a European construction executive, who is
directing a small-scale irrigation project in the desert, said the
project failed because the farmers preferred to put in their extra
work into private lands, not the state-run irrigated fields.
   Jaouda said water from the project will be used for both state
and private lands.
   He estimated that the Great Manmade River's water, pumped up
from natural wells 1,150 feet below the ground, will last 50 years.
   The pipe segments, each weighing 72 tons, and measuring 23 feet
long and 13 feet in diameter, will probably outlast the water, he
said.

   A businesswoman trying to crack the so-called
glass ceiling may find a useful tool in a new book that lists the
50 companies that, in the authors' view, give women the best
opportunity for advancement. Here's a report on how the list was
compiled.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By KAY BARTLETT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not a book an unreconstructed male
chauvinist will run out and buy, unless perhaps he's a CEO. It's
written by women for women, working women, a guide to the companies
where they are most likely to succeed.
   Two avowed feminists, one a psychologist and business
consultant, the other a journalist and author, spent almost three
years in their quest to find the best U.S. companies for women.
They came up with a list of 50.
   ``It is possible that we missed a great company,'' says the
journalist, Lorraine Dusky of Sag Harbor, N.Y., ``but I doubt it.''
   The researchers sent letters to 76 executive recruiters, 72
professional women's groups and 15 researchers and asked for
nominations. They came up with over 200 nominations. Some companies
appeared on every list.
   Dusky and co-author Dr. Baila Zeitz, a psychologist who
practices in New York City and Teaneck, N.J., then sent out a
six-page questionnaire to the companies and requested permission
for an on-site visit to interview female employees.
   They followed that up with private telephone interviews with the
women, who were allowed to remain anonymous if what they had to say
might jeopardize their jobs.
   The result is ``The Best Companies for Women,'' published this
summer by Simon & Schuster. It lists the 50 best companies,
representing 22 industries, and gives profiles of each.
   The authors offer specific pros and cons, be it maternity leave
benefits or the whereabouts of the much-discussed glass ceiling
that women can only look through.
   ``We found that often those with terrific benefits for maternity
leave had a glass ceiling so low that you couldn't stand up
straight without bumping into it,'' Dusky says.
   ``We also found that the attitude of the CEO had a great deal to
do with the way the company treated women.''
   In addition, the authors list 60 additional companies worth
considering by women in the job market, but which they did not
profile, for various reasons.
   ``Some companies that maybe should have been on the list refused
to see us, because there was some dirt going on,'' Dusky says. One
company who turned them down cold despite recommendations was found
to be in the midst of a sexual harassment suit.
   In one of the anecdotes in the book, which reflect the slow
progress of the women's movement in the workplace, Sara Dickinson,
who got her engineering degree from the University of Illinois in
1976, tells how she had no trouble setting up a job interview. But
she was appalled that the interviewer did not want to know about
her engineering skills. Instead they talked about the climate, the
prices of apartments in the city and how long it would take to
establish a credit line to buy a car.
   ``They must have wanted me for some quota,'' she told Dusky.
   Only Hewlett-Packard threw a transistor circuit at her and told
her to analyze it. So she took that job. Nonetheless, she did get a
chance to look at the recruiter's summary. It read: ``Pretty good
for a girl.''
   She is still there, has been promoted about every two years, and
is currently a research and development laboratory manager.
   The authors point out that working in an engineering company is
really working in a man's world and there is a lot to overcome, but
with a little humor, the women say it can be done.
   Wall Street, the authors note, has been notoriously tough on
women and the only Wall Street entry is Salomon Brothers. That's
because of one man, John Gutfreund, the CEO.
   ``If he gets interested in an account, he doesn't care if you're
a zebra or someone from a small area of Tibet, you're the person
he'll call if anything gets screwed up or he's got an idea he wants
you to think about,'' said one woman who wished to remain
anonymous. ``And if you need to find him, you just walk over to his
desk, you don't have to go through a secretary. He is colorblind
and sex blind. He's not interested in you personally, he's only
interested in what you are doing to make money from your accounts.''
   Essentially, they say, the old boy networks are too entrenched
and women rise for the first eight or nine years and then are told
it's time to face reality. That's the end of the trail as far as
upward mobility.
   As determined by the authors, the top 50, in alphabetical order,
are: American Express@Shearson Lehman Hutton; American Telephone &
Telegraph; Avon Products; Barrios Technology; Bidermann Industries;
CBS; Children's Television Workshop; Citizens and Southern; Cognos;
Conran Stores; The Denver Post; Digital Equipment Corporation;
Drake Business Schools; Federal Express; Fidelity Bank; First
Atlanta; Gannett; General Mills; Grey Advertising; GTE; Hallmark;
Hearst Trade Books.
   Herman Miller; Hewitt Associates; Hewlett-Packard; Home Box
Office; Honeywell; International Business Machines; Levi Strauss;
Lotus; Manufacturers Hanover Trust; Merck; Mountain Bell; Mount
Carmel Health; Neiman-Marcus; Northwestern Bell; Payless Cashways;
PepsiCo; Pitney Bowes; Procter & Gamble; Recognition Equipment;
Restaurant Enterprises Group; The Rowland Company; Saks Fifth
Avenue; Salomon Brothers; Simon & Schuster; Southern New England
Telephone; Syntex; Time Inc., and U.S. West Direct.

<TEXT>
   The clatter of freight trains has
replaced the crackle of gunfire and the whoosh of combat jets in
this town on the Soviet border.
   Criss-crossing the rolling grasslands of Inner Mongolia and
Siberia, the trains provide noisy testimony to improving relations
between China and the Soviet Union.
   While officials in Beijing and Moscow still haggle over
political matters, businessmen in Manzhouli and dozens of other
towns along the 5,000-mile border are eagerly cementing closer
economic ties.
   ``The Russians are very easy to deal with,'' said Zhang
Chengbin, a businessman from a state-run firm that sold $31.4
million in meat to the Soviets in the first six months of this
year. ``They're like the Americans, they don't worry too much about
prices.''
   ``Now's the time to get in on the trade,'' said Zhang Wei, a
private businessman in Harbin, provincial capital of Heilongjiang.
``In the next couple of years it will explode. The Soviets don't
have enough things and they like Chinese goods.''
   In Manzhouli, connected to Russia by rail since 1901, Soviet
trucks, chemical fertilizer, wood, steel, iron ore, electrical
generators and bulldozers cram freight cars, moving south into the
Chinese heartland.
   Soviet railway workers and trade delegations walk freely around
the town of 30,000, dotted with traditional Russian houses, their
log-cabin walls painted yellow and blue.
   ``It's fascinating to be here,'' said Andrev Vedernikov, a
Russian railway worker, as he strolled down Sino-Soviet Road, the
town's main street. ``Manzhouli is like a small museum of Russia 50
years ago.''
   Across the border in Zabaikalsk, freight cars packed with
Chinese meats, fruit, vegetables, grains, television sets, radios
and thermos bottles fill the station.
   ``You think there are many trains here?'' said Vadim Evdokimov,
another railway worker, as he looked out over Manzhouli's cluttered
freight yard. ``Zabaikalsk is even busier.''
   Chinese press reports say that in the first six months of this
year, trade between the Soviet Union and China reached $1.3
billion, a 32 percent jump when compared to the same period last
year. But Chinese businessmen said the real amount could rival
China's trade with the United States, which hit $10 billion last
year.
   Indeed, on Aug. 29, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
that combined trade in the border provinces of Heilongjiang and
Xinjiang had hit $707 million in the first half of 1988, or about
800 percent above their total for all of 1987.
   After two decades of tense relations, China and the Soviet Union
started trading again in the early 1980s. It began with barter.
This year, it expanded to include purchases with currency from a
third country, usually American dollars, and the export of Chinese
labor to the Soviet Union. In a further twist, Chinese officials in
Heilongjiang said privately they expect Soviet technical advisers
to return soon to China.
   ``In the 1950s, we traded because we were friends,'' said Xing
Wenzhao, an official in Heilongjiang's Bureau of Foreign Trade.
``Now, we do it because we need to. That is a healthy development.''
   Chinese officials say labor export could become the most
important part of Sino-Soviet trade. Several said that China could
easily supply the manpower to develop Siberia.
   In its report Aug. 29, Xinhua said about 10,000 Chinese workers
were expected to head to the Soviet Union over the next year for
construction and farming.
   Labor export began in July when more than 100 Chinese
construction workers went to Zabaikalsk to build a gymnasium,
several dormitories and a dining hall. Earlier in the year, 77
Chinese peasants were given 1,071 acres to grow cucumbers and
watermelons in the Soviet Union north of Vladivostok across the
border from Suifenhe, another important trading post.
   ``We gave the Russians half and then sold them the rest,'' said
a Chinese official in Harbin who worked on the contract. ``We're
looking at it as a model for future deals. It makes perfect sense
because we have a huge work force and they have a lot of land.''
   For their part, Soviet officials in Manzhouli said they were
interested in China for its consumer goods and food.
   ``Our agriculture and our light industry are weak,'' said a
Soviet businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``China
for us is like a big supermarket. Their stuff is generally good and
inexpensive.''
   In the early 1950s, the Soviet Union sent thousands of Soviet
technical advisers to China to help set up factories.
   But relations soured in the late 1950s as China embraced a
development model that emphasized people over machines, radically
different from the Soviet plan.
   By 1962, all Soviet advisers had left China. Several years
later, as China moved farther left in its Cultural Revolution,
firefights broke out periodically along the border. In 1969, Soviet
and Chinese troops fought pitched battles on Damansky Island, or
Zhenbao in Chinese, on the Ussuri River. Clashes spread to Inner
Mongolia.
   ``At night, gunshots would echo all around the valley,'' said
Wen He, a 59-year-old railroad worker, who sent his three sons
south for a year to protect them. ``In the daytime, their jets and
ours would fly above the town. We were all scared.''
   Ties began improving slowly in the late 1970s, after Deng
Xiaoping took power and instituted a series of reforms to open
China to the West. They have improved further since Mikhail S.
Gorbachev became Soviet Communist Party chief in 1985 and began to
reform his country.
   ``Now all you hear at night in Manzhouli are train whistles,''
said Guan Lancheng, a 54-year-old coal miner, as he strolled to his
house on a bluff overlooking the hills of Siberia. ``It is very
peaceful.''
   Economic relations have not proceeded without glitches. The
Chinese complain that the Soviets give them only their worst timber
and charge that Soviet business practices are not flexible enough.
   The Soviets accuse the Chinese of trying to cheat them. They
also complain that China's poor railways and road network are
hampering trade growth.
   Soviet officials have provided some help to the Chinese
transportation system, floating Beijing a $180-million loan earlier
this year to recommence work on a railway to connect China's far
west to Soviet Central Asia.
   Both countries have moved to further relax trade restrictions.
   As of Aug. 13, the two countries dropped visa requirements for
businessmen. More border trading posts have opened. And in July,
China announced that local governments _ not only those in border
provinces _ would be allowed to cut deals with their Soviet
counterparts.
   ``From that point on it's been very busy in Manzhouli,'' said
Xue Guiyuan, vice chairman of Manzhouli's Committee for Foreign
Trade. ``Everyone is coming here to talk to the Soviets. Our hotels
are packed. We're a hot spot, which is kind of odd for such a
little town.''

<HEAD>Soviets Coming Back to China and Welcome Is Warm</HEAD>

   At the Crying Deer Restaurant on
Sino-Soviet Road, chef Sun Zhaomin cracks a toothless grin and runs
to the back to grab two plates of his famous salad.
   ``Soviet friends, you've returned,'' he shouts. ``Soviet
friends, we welcome you.''
   Andrev Vedernikov and Vadim Evdokimov, railway workers in this
town on the Soviet border, have come back for another meal.
   Down the street, at the International Guest House, members of
the Soviet Friendship Delegation from Zabaikalsk dance the night
away with their counterparts from the Manzhouli Sino-Soviet
Friendship Committee.
   At the close of the evening, under revolving green and red disco
lights, Xue Guiyuan, a Chinese trade official, waxes melodramatic.
   ``Two great nations are becoming friends again,'' he says. ``Two
peoples are moving closer together.''
   On train No. 390, heading east from Manzhouli, Ira Shamrett, 48,
and her son, Kostya, 19, are off to see relatives in Harbin, the
provincial capital of China's Heilongjiang province.
   ``We come from Siberia,'' announces Mrs. Shamrett in rusty
Chinese, learned in the five years she spent in Harbin as a
youngster. ``It's been more than 30 years since I saw my brother.''
   ``I hope to learn about kung-fu,'' said her son. ``It's becoming
very popular back home.''
   Just as trade has blossomed between China and the Soviet Union,
so have contacts between Chinese and Soviets. Since last year,
China has allowed Soviets to return to its border provinces to
visit relatives who stayed after relations between the two
countries deteriorated in the late 1950s. The Soviets have done the
same for Chinese with family in Siberia and Soviet Central Asia.
   Both countries also have dropped visa requirements for
businessmen.
   Vedernikov, 30, and Evdokimov, 29, who work on Soviet freight
trains between Manzhouli and Zabaikalsk, studied Chinese for five
years at the Chita Pedagological Institute, about 180 miles from
the Chinese border.
   Now they handle freight and mail, which have both increased
markedly as trade between the countries rises.
   ``I had a choice between a job as a teacher or work on this
train,'' said Evdokimov, speaking a mixture of Chinese and English.
``The job is boring, but I wanted to see China. It fascinates me
strongly.''
   Vedernikov hopes to parlay his excellent Chinese into a job as a
businessmen.
   ``I was trained to be a translator, but when I finished school
in 1980 things were still bad between our countries so there were
no jobs. Now there's much possibility,'' he said.
   The two men said they were impressed at the economic growth in
China, especially at the relative abundance of vegetables and
consumer goods. They also noted the increasing number of private
businesses, of which the Crying Deer is one.
   ``Private or cooperative businesses in the Soviet Union are just
beginning, but here they've been going on for about five years
now,'' said Vedernikov. ``I think they can teach us very much.''
   Sun, a 61-year-old former member of China's famed Eighth Route
Army and regarded as the best chef in town, agrees.
   ``I say open the borders wide and we'll show them how to make
money,'' he said. ``That would be a twist.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Sweet Hearts Dance''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Television sitcoms have always known about it. Presidential
politicians have embraced it. Now the movies are redisovering the
potent appeal of The Family.
   ``Sweet Hearts Dance'' is the latest variation on the family
theme, and it is an unexpected winner. No movie has so touched the
heart since ``Terms of Endearment.''
   Of course, you might expect ``Sweet Hearts Dance'' to be
impressive when you note that the writer is Ernest Thompson. His
play and movie of ``On Golden Pond'' were exquisite depictions of
the joys and sorrows of old age. Now he focuses on a younger
generation of marrieds and about-to-be marrieds, contributing an
equal portion of humanity and understanding.
   Susan Sarandon and Don Johnson have been married long enough for
boredom to have set in. She tolerates his macho pastimes, he
largely ignores her womanly longings. He is a builder, and their
life in a Norman Rockwellian New England town is comfortable,
familiar and dull.
   Johnson's best buddy is Jeff Daniels. He is a school principal,
a bit dull but by no means dumb. A devout bachelor, he is attracted
to the new teacher in town, Elizabeth Perkins, but is wary of
commitment.
   The story is told in seasons, each framed like an old-time
calendar. The seasons change, as do the relationships of the four
characters.
   Johnson, rankling under his loss of freedom, finally moves out
of the family house. After a Caribbean vacation with his lodge
members, the four lives are sorted out, more or less.
   A synopsis makes it seem that not much happens in ``Sweet Hearts
Dance.'' But it is constantly engrossing, tender without excess
sentiment, and often hilarious. Amazingly, the film is the first
feature directed by Robert Greenwald, a television veteran who has
a bright future in films.
   Thompson's script and Greenwald's direction give the four stars
equal opportunity to shine. With her wise, wondering eyes, Sarandon
is the ideal portrayer of the 1980s woman. Johnson is a revelation,
displaying none of his ``Miami Vice'' schtick. Daniels is ideal for
the role as the intelligent innocent, and Elizabeth Perkins
(``Big'') registers again as a bright screen presence.
   ``Sweet Hearts Dance'' has so many moments to cherish that it
should probably be seen twice for full appreciation.
   The Tri-Star release was produced by Jeffrey Lourie. The rating
is R, mostly for language. Running time: 101 minutes.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Cop,'' ``batteries not included.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Cop'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS, $89.95; Beta, $29.95; Rated
R)
   
   Sgt. Lloyd Hopkins is the kind of cop who wears his profession
on his chest in big red letters. He's a COP. He makes his own rules
and breaks others and he doesn't care who he has to whack in order
to rid the world of bad guys and scum.
   All this makes Sgt. Lloyd Hopkins (James Woods) infinitely more
dangerous than Jack the Ripper.
   He's a married man who thinks nothing of giving a hooker a
whirl, and a father who tells his small daughter bedtime stories
about his violent escapades. In the understatement of the video
year, his wife tells him he's a very sick man, and she takes the
kid and leaves him.
   Hopkins doesn't have time to brood about crimes of the heart;
he's hot on the heels of a serial killer.
   Hopkins is the one man who thinks a serial killer is involved in
the obscene murder of a young woman. He's convinced she is the 15th
victim of the same murderer and becomes obsessed in the hunt.
   Charles Durning puts in a good performance as Hopkins' buddy and
superior, and Charles Haid of TV's ``Hill Street Blues'' is fine as
a sleazy, homosexual cop on the take.
   But Lesley Ann Warren's feminist poet, the killer's secret love
object, sets the women's movement back 50 years. She's a whimpering
idiot who chainsmokes her way into a dangerous situation.
   Woods, who co-produced the movie with director James B. Harris,
is in just about every scene. With his squirrelly look and staccato
sentences, he's fairly convincing as a cop about to implode.
   Much of the plot is predictable, and uneven editing leaves major
holes in the story. The R rating is well deserved for a screenful
of blood and guts.

   ``batteries not included'' (MCA Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95;
Rated PG)
   
   One more whimsical fantasy from the Steven Spielberg factory _
maybe one too many.
   Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy head a cast of oddly assorted
characters holding out against a ruthless developer who wants to
buy them out of their crumbling New York tenement so he can build a
skyscraper. When they say no, the creep hires a thug to destroy the
place.
   Enter the cutest little creatures from outer space you ever saw
_ flying saucers with eyes, arms and legs who reproduce, eat pieces
of coffee pots and frying pans, and _ most important _ fix things.
Things like broken windows, watches, doors and, eventually, the
entire building.
   They also fix broken hearts and minds, sparking a romance
between two of the characters, helping Cronyn and Tandy patch up
their marriage, and rehabilitating a washed-up prize fighter who
hasn't done anything in years but watch TV commercials.
   The special effects are fun for a while, and kids will put up
with the ridiculous plot, but grownups are likely to gag on the
treacly sentimentality. There's also a fair amount of bashing and
burning, which could prove upsetting for very young children.

   ``Folk Songs, Children's Melodies, Jazz Tunes, And Others ...''
(Antilles-New Directions) _ Michal Urbaniak
   
   Not at all the hodgepodge of styles suggested by the title,
Michal Urbaniak's ``Folk Songs, Children's Melodies, Jazz Tunes,
And Others ...'' is amazing, wild and beautiful music that should
not be missed.
   Urbaniak is a Polish-born violinist who has recorded in many
styles. This collection, 10 duets with pianist Vladislav Sendecki,
is hard to pin a label on, but it sure sounds good.
   The album gets off to a manic, joyful start with two songs that
kick like a pair of size 20 boots. By the time ``Munchkins'' and
``Toy's Corner'' are over, listeners might find themselves gasping
for air and begging for a break in the action.
   Urbaniak and Sendecki deliver that in ``September's,'' a
meditative piece that leads off a series of slower, more relaxed
songs that are always compelling. But on ``Waltz,'' the second song
on Side 2, it's off to the races again as the pace picks up before
winding down with the jazzy finale called ``Montag.''
   Urbaniak's music usually is heavily into electronics, but this
album is all acoustic. And there's never a dull moment.

   ``Greatest Hits'' (RCA) _ The Judds
   
   On the back cover of this, their obligatory greatest-hits album,
Naomi and Wynonna Judd tell us about ``the four shortest years of
our lives,'' since they shopped their homemade demos around and
landed themselves a record deal.
   No, it doesn't seem like four years, but it has been. And this
``best-of'' package stands as testimony to the fact that The Judds,
the much publicized red-headed mother-daughter duo, can no longer
be taken as a novelty act or a curiosity. Naomi and Wynonna have
made a harmonious place for themselves in 1980s country music.
   Nine of the 10 selections here have been released before on The
Judds' three studio albums. The big hits are present and accounted
for: ``Why Not Me,'' ``Mama He's Crazy,'' ``Girls Night Out.''
   ``Why Not Me'' opens the collection and sets the tone; it's a
proud, no-nonsense song sung by two proud, no-nonsense women. The
Judds know who they are, and they know what they want _ love,
happiness, respect.
   The lone new track is their current hit, ``Give a Little Love,''
which continues their proud tradition with a bluesy, soulful
approach.
   Like most greatest-hits packages, The Judds give old fans all
their favorites in one place, while giving the uninitiated a
freshman course in Judds 101.
   One minor complaint: They should have included their 1987
country cover of ``Don't Be Cruel.'' Elvis, wherever he is these
days, would have been proud.

   ``Open All Night'' (Elektra) _ Georgia Satellites
   
   When the Georgia Satellites get their sentence in rock history
books, it will surely mention ``Keep Your Hands to Yourself,'' the
hard-rocking tale of sexual frustration that brightened radio
airwaves in 1986.
   Trouble is, that was on their debut album. ``Open All Night'' is
the Satellites' second album and, predictably, lightning doesn't
strike twice.
   The good news about ``Open All Night'' is that the Satellites
didn't tear out their hair trying to rewrite their hit. They also
don't pretend to be anything other than what they are, a raunchy
guitar army trying to fill a void left by the absence of the
Rolling Stones.
   The bad news is the cupboard is nearly bare. For all the
inspired bashing and banging, only a few songs truly stand out.
There are two cover tunes on Side 1, which usually signals a lack
of inspiration.
   Both Jerry Lee Lewis' ``Whole Lotta Shakin''' and the Beatles'
``Don't Pass Me By'' are given typical raucous workouts. But it's
daunting _ and maybe dangerous _ to try and top the Killer, and
there are reasons why ``Don't Pass Me By'' is one of the most
obscure Beatle songs.
   ``Sheila'' is the standout tune on the album, and that's an
original. The rockers tend to blur together on the second side,
until the record ends strongly with the bluesy ``Hand to Mouth,''
featuring excellent guitar by Rick Richards and the piano of guest
Ian McLagan.
   Along with assorted girlfriends and roadies, the band thanks on
the album cover ``Mr. Chuck Berry and Mr. Jack Daniels.'' That says
about as much as you need to know about the Georgia Satellites'
music.

   Richard Dreyfuss has this fantasy about his
opening remarks at the press conference to announce his candidacy
for U.S. senator from California:
   ``I want to tell you right off that: 1. I am a Jew; 2. I am a
recovering alcoholic; 3. I was arrested on narcotic charges, 4. I
have been in therapy. Now gimme a break!''
   No, Dreyfuss is not prepared to declare his candidacy yet _
maybe in the next century.
   ``By that time I'll be 53 years old, and I'll probably be giving
up acting,'' he said. ``I've always had two major interests in my
life outside of acting. One is politics, the other is teaching. So
if I don't go into politics, I'll probably become a teacher.''
   There's little chance of a change of profession right away. Not
with his film career once again at a peak after near-extinction.
The Dreyfuss story is one of the most remarkable comebacks in
recent times.
   His lowest point was the day after he was arrested. ``I told my
wife, `Well, it's over. I guess I'll have to find something else to
do,''' he said.
   It happened in October 1982. Driving down Benedict Canyon, he
lost control of his Mercedes-Benz and crashed into a palm tree,
flipping the car over. Police found two vials of cocaine and 31
tablets of the narcotic Percodan in the car. As with most
first-time offenders, he entered a drug rehabilitation program to
avoid prosecution.
   The drug bust almost sank a career that had already been
foundering.
   `I had nothing but flops for four years,'' he admitted. ``It's
pretty hard to rise above something like that.''
   His mishaps included ``The Big Fix,'' ``The Competition,''
``Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' and ``The Buddy System.'' On the last
film, his behavior seemed erratic, and word circulated that Richard
Dreyfuss was a bad risk.
   ``That might have been the end, except that Paul Mazursky
happened to see me in a play in New York, `Total Abandon,''' said
Dreyfuss. ``He insisted on casting me in `Down and Out in Beverly
Hills.'''
   The comedy proved a hit for Disney's Touchstone Pictures, and
Dreyfuss appeared in two more successes for the company, ``The Tin
Men'' and ``Stakeout.'' His new film is ``Moon Over Parador,''
reuniting with Paul Mazursky.
   In the Universal Pictures movie, Dreyfuss plays a hustling New
York actor forced to impersonate a recently deceased Latin American
dictator. It is a tour de force for him, made under rugged
conditions in the historic Brazilian cities of Ouro Preto and
Salvador de Bahia.
   Co-starring with Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and Jonathan Winters,
Dreyfuss was required to address 8,000 Brazilians as the Latin
dictator. ``That didn't bother me,'' he said. ``I've addressed
large crowds before, though on other occasions the people
understood what I was saying.''
   Now 40, he has been an actor most of his life. He was born in
Brooklyn, but his lawyer-father moved the family to California when
Dreyfuss was 7. The boy grew up among the children of the rich and
famous in Beverly Hills. He was 9 when he announced he intended to
become an actor, and he occasionally acted in plays and films
during his teens.
   Dreyfuss makes no claims to a ``lost childhood.''
   ``During all that time I was a son, a brother, a student, as
well as an actor,'' he said. ``I had a fairly normal boyhood.''
   He lasted only a year at San Fernando Valley State College
before pursuing a career in earnest. In 1973, he attracted notice
as Baby Face Nelson in ``Dillinger,'' then he joined the
now-legendary cast of ``American Graffiti.'' Two other blockbusters
of the 1970s followed: ``Jaws'' and ``Close Encounters of the Third
Kind.''
   The climax of the Dreyfuss career came with the Academy Award he
received as best actor for ``The Goodbye Girl.'' Then he began the
downhill race, accelerated by bad decisions, alcohol and drugs.
   Dreyfuss was interviewed at a location that symbolizes his
return to grace. He occupies a suite of offices at Lorimar Studios,
where he is developing film projects. He expects to continue the
arrangement with Warner Bros., which has taken over Lorimar.
   Understandably, Dreyfuss is weary of reliving his downfall for
reporters.
   ``Recently I ran into Barbara Walters, who asked to interview me
for her show,'' he said. ``I told her, `Look, Barbara, there is
only one Richard Dreyfuss story at the moment, and I have already
told that story in Parade magazine, USA Today, etc. Until there is
another Richard Dreyfuss story, I'd rather wait.'
   ``You know what she said? `I have to agree with you.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: Faded, Scarred Rothko Murals on Display</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late abstract expressionist Mark
Rothko said he was less interested in color and form than in
expressing human emotions.
   Now, as Harvard University displays a colossal series of Rothko
murals, the consequences of the artist's philosophy _ as well as
years of neglect _ have become clear.
   The three murals, some 500 square feet of oil and acrylic on
canvas, have badly faded in the sunlight during the 16 years they
hung in a Harvard dining room, so much so that they actually have
changed color. They also suffered rips, scratches and splatters
caused by bumping chairs and spilled food. On one panel is scrawled
the name Alan C.
   The institution for years was criticized for what was believed
to be its mishandling of the paintings, particularly from devotees
of the so-called New York School of modern artists, co-founded by
Rothko before World War II.
   A new study conducted by Harvard scholars has turned up two
prime culprits: the artist and Harvard University. Rothko
contributed to the demise of the works by using a highly unstable
paint _ lithol red _ to form the background of all three murals.
Harvard made matters worse by failing to protect the canvases from
sunlight and careless visitors.
   ``Harvard has gotten so much bad press about the Rothkos that we
didn't feel it would matter if we said again, `they're in tough
shape,''' said Marjorie Cohn, head conservator at Harvard.
   The color used by Rothko has a reputation as a ``fugitive
pigment'' and its fleeting existence on Rothko's canvas explains
why.
   The artist apparently had no idea in 1962 when he completed the
paintings that the color was susceptible to fading. His attitude
toward the subject was revealed in a conversation related by
Elizabeth Jones, head conservator of Harvard's Fogg Art Museum in
the late 1960s:
   ``I said, `What kind of paint do you use?''' Jones recalled in a
telephone interview. ``He said, `I use oil paint and if I run out I
go downstairs to the Woolworths and buy whatever's there.' He
should have known better.''
   The five-and-dime paint wasn't up to the conditions in the
sun-filled penthouse suite in Harvard Square that housed the murals
from 1963 until 1979 when, scratched, scuffed and faded, they were
removed to a vault.
   A wine-dark crimson, chosen in honor of Harvard, formed the
background color of the murals. On two panels, the color faded to a
dull, denim blue _ nearly Yale blue. And to make matters worse, the
color faded unevenly, ruining the intended uniformity of background
that made the room vibrate with color.
   ``It was like walking into a medieval cathedral at sunset,''
said Jones, who helped unroll and mount the paintings when they
arrived at Harvard.
   The paintings are on display at Harvard's Sackler museum through
Oct. 2. They are arranged in the same configuration as their
original setting in the university's Holyoke Center but are now far
from any direct sunlight.
   ``If (Rothko) could see the extent to which these particular
color relations had been so drastically altered he would most
likely disown the paintings,'' said Harvard associate art Professor
Anna Chave, a Rothko expert. ``I think they're relics, basically.
They're artifacts.''
   The paintings still have value, in Chave's view, much the way
Leonardo's ``The Last Supper'' can move a viewer despite extensive
deterioration.
   ``They were allowed to be exposed to an incredible amount of
light in their original installation and that's why they faded so
drastically,'' Chave said. ``No one was doing anything about it.
Harvard really did not pay attention to what was happening.''
   John Coolidge, former director of the Fogg and one of those
directly involved in promoting Rothko's donation of the murals to
Harvard, places most of the blame on the artist. ``Rothko was
passionate to create a room, but he had not the slightest idea what
was involved,'' Coolidge said. Meanwhile, Harvard officials, he
said, were loathe to ``question the quality of his technique. ...
We were certainly unprepared for the speed with which they went.''
   Rothko was contacted once about the fading of the murals, Chave
said. He rejected a proposal to varnish the canvases to protect
them. In 1970, at age 67, Rothko committed suicide, 57 years after
he came to the United States from the Soviet Union. After his
death, confusion and controversy over control of Rothko's estate
complicated any decision about the Harvard paintings.
   Since then, another, even larger set of murals at the Rothko
Chapel in Houston has had to undergo treatment because a chemical
used in their varnish reacted with the atmosphere to create white
splotches on black paint.
   But Dana Cranmer, former conservator of the Rothko foundation,
said Rothko is only one of many modern artists whose works have

   Like the title of her current hit single, Brenda
K. Starr says she still believes stardom will be hers.
   ``I believe in myself, but I know it takes time,'' says the
21-year-old singer, whose first hit single, ``I Still Believe'' has
climbed the charts to the Top 40.
   She recently talked about her career in an interview at the
offices of MCA Records. She compared herself to a long list of
contemporary artists, including Janet Jackson, Anita Baker and
Diana Ross, before actually calling herself a ``young Donna
Summer.''
   Starr has been heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and Latin
sounds, and she likes her music to have those elements.
   However, she doesn't like to be compared to other young artists
such as Tiffany or Debbie Gibson. She says they're too ``pure.''
She prefers being thought of as sexier.
   ``I'm a romantic,'' Starr said.
   Her self-titled LP contains the popular love ballad, ``I Still
Believe,'' as well as more upbeat tracks, including the hit ``What
You See Is What You Get.'' Most of these danceable tunes portray
love and happiness, with one pop tune that warns against drunken
driving.
   Born Brenda Kaplan on Manhattan's Upper West Side, she took the
last name Starr because ``that's what I've always wanted to be, a
star.''
   She started singing in choirs in grammar and junior high school.
``They always had choirs that you could join as a hobby, so I took
singing because I felt it was fun,'' she said.
   Starr dropped out of high school to put out her first album, ``I
Want Your Love,'' on Mirage Records. She later realized a lot more
than singing was involved in the music business and that there was
a lot more to life than singing, so she went back to school to get
her diploma.
   Her first big break came when she appeared in the movie ``Beat
Street,'' a 1984 dance film, as an auditioning singer. She also
co-wrote the songs ``Shadows of the Night'' and ``Vicious Beat''
for the movie's soundtrack.
   Her other appearances were with an all-girl breakdancing group
called The Dynamic Dolls. They once performed in Washington for
President and Mrs. Reagan.
   Though her father, Harvey Kaplan, who sang with the pop group
Spiral Staircase, was in the music business, he wasn't her main
influence.
   ``My father didn't influence me, my mother influenced me,''
Starr said. ``She always told me I would be successful and if I
wanted to do something I could do it. My father? I was happy that
he was my dad and he had a record out, but I wanted to show him
that I could do just as he could so he would be proud of me. Now
I'm doing it for me.''
   Starr spends a lot of time on the road touring. After meetings
with managers, voice lessons and family visits to New York, she
enjoys returning to the tranquility of her new home in North
Bergen, N.J., where she's writing songs for an upcoming album.
   What's does Starr see in her future?
   ``I want to be married by 24 and have a baby by 25,'' said the
singer, who already has names picked out for the five children she
wants. ``They'll be my audience in case there's not enough of one.
I want to be like my mom, who had seven. It's like camp.''
   Another movie apperance isn't on her agenda, though.
   ``I've been asked to do movies but haven't taken anyone up on
their offer because I'm so into my music right now,'' she said.
``I'm trying to concentrate on my shows and do a good performance
so people can enjoy me and say, `I'm going to go out and buy that
album.'''
   Asked about doing television, Starr perked up and said with a
big smile, ``I want to do the Cosby Show. I want to meet Bill
Cosby.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Big Picture of the Auto Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the story of maverick automaker Preston Tucker
is being discovered by movie-goers in the acclaimed George
Lucas-Francis Coppola movie ``Tucker,'' dozens of writers continue
to labor quietly on the big picture of automobile history.
   Books on the rich development of the industry and its cultural
impact remain largely left to small publishing houses and
university presses.
   Five recent publications are worth reading. Here are thumbnail
sketches of them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   James J. Flink's ``The Automobile Age'' (The MIT Press, $25) is
thick with colorful detail on the industry, its leaders and the
automobile as an icon.
   He focuses on all the highlights, such as the days when Henry
Ford's Model T democratized the industry by making cars affordable
for millions of Americans.
   He then steers us through the emergence of stylized cars at
General Motors under the direction of Alfred P. Sloan Jr., and the
legendary Harley J. Earl, head of the Styling Section, when GM
outsold Ford in every year from 1931 to 1970 with the exception of
1935 and 1945.
   There also are low points: the modern Japanese invasion; Ford
Motor Co. turning down Volkswagen for free after World War II, and
how under German direction it became by 1972 the best-selling car
in the history of the automobile industry.
   Flink blends observations of cultural historians to show the
many changes wrought by the car culture: the disappearance of
corner grocers and the emergence of the supermarket; the
proliferation of fast-food joints; the increased ability of
millions to vacation at far-flung spots; the emergence of
entrepreneurs who had an eye on the road, such as Howard Johnson,
who turned an idea into an empire on short order.
   He looks at the car as an emancipator of women, as destroyer of
close relationships with neighbors, as a modifier of architecture.
   Flink is a professor of comparative culture at the University of
California, Irvine, and affiliated with its Institute of
Transportation Studies. He also is the author of ``The Car
Culture,'' and ``America Adopts the Automobile.''

   The history of the car industry gets a coffee-table presentation
in Walter J. Boyne's ``Power Behind the Wheel: Creativity and the
Evolution of the Automobile'' (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $35).
   Boyne, former head of the National Air and Space Museum of the
Smithsonian Institution, parlays his experience into an attractive
book.
   The book is complemented by archival pictures and especially by
the work of collaborator Lucinda Lewis, a specialist in automobile
photography.
   Whether Lewis is focusing her camera on the door of a Duesenberg
SJ, the lights of a Lincoln or the fine points of a Pierce Silver
Arrow, the result enhances, and sometimes overshadows, Boyne's
history.
   The author augments some of the technical history with such
colorful items as a letter the outlaw Clyde Barrow wrote to Henry
Ford to tell him that the Ford V8 was his preferred business car.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Those hidden personalities behind the wheel get full attention
in ``Driving Passion: The Psychology of the Car'' (Faber and Faber,
$16.95).
   British authors Peter Marsh and Peter Collett explore the car as
a part of the home we take to the road. They see the car as a
weapon, one that can kill and turn even the most affable people
into hostile aggressors when encountering a tailgater or undimmed
headlights, ``the automotive equivalent of the hostile stare.''
   They see the automobile as sanctuary; as a provider of the
sensual delight of speed; as a courtship vehicle, and as a
statement of status.
   They get right down to the color of cars, citing studies that
show people who have a high desire to achieve are more likely to be
found in a brown, black or gray car, and to speed. Those operating
at a more casual pace are likely to be found sitting in a red or
yellow vehicle.
   In the recondite asides can be found the identity of the
millionth victim of an automobile accident and the owner of the
first vanity license plate, A1, issued in Britain in 1903 and said
to be worth around $100,000.
   But it's the thought that counts here. The authors look behind
1950s design, for example, to tell us how the ubiquitous fins of
the era grew from a fascination with fighter planes. They
eventually caught on as the main design motif of the day and were
embellished with snarling grilles ``clearly intended as a
subliminal form of threat display,'' and moldings attached to the
bumpers that were ``patently erotic.''

   In ``Los Angeles and the Automobile: The Making of the Modern
City'' (University of California Press, $27.50), Scott L. Bottles
traces the battles among railway monopolies, merchants, consumers
and city hall that led to the emergence of the first major
automobile metropolis in the United States.
   He says the early rail systems in the city _ the Pacific
Electric Railway Co. and the Los Angeles Railway Co. of Collis P.
Huntington, whose routes were tied in with his vast real estate
holdings _ simply failed to meet consumer demands for efficiency
and safety.
   The automobile became a desired alternative, and by 1925 every
other resident of Los Angeles owned a car, as compared to 1 in 6
Americans elsewhere. As early as 1930, with all traffic still
routed to the central business district, fears were raised about
gridlock.
   In 1928, when Bullock's Department Store moved from downtown and
out to Wilshire Boulevard, the move by retail stores to the suburbs
was on. Refinements in trucks helped manufacturers to take the same
route out of the crowded city. Then came the freeways to link the
communities, and the rest is the sprawl that is modern-day greater
Los Angeles.

   Donald Finlay Davis, in ``Conspicuous Production: Automobiles
and Elites in Detroit, 1899-1933'' (Temple University Press,
$29.95), focuses on the city's bluebloods who largely blew their
chance to capitalize on the industry.
   Davis, a history professor at the University of Ottawa, tells
how Detroit's old families, who had made fortunes in lumber,
mining, banking and stove manufacturing, shunned Henry Ford's
commitment to producing affordable cars for the masses and aimed at
the more expensive market. They eventually priced themselves out of
the fledgling industry even as it grew prodigiously.
   By 1910, as competition increased and the ventures got bigger
and riskier, Detroit's old families took a back seat forever,
refusing even to accept any stock as part of the sale of three big
makers _ Cadillac, Olds and E-M-F _ to General Motors.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Young ``Upstart'' Gives Old Pro a Break</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the time Dwight Yoakam and Buck Owens
have finished touring together, the younger performer may be sorry
he coaxed the country music legend out of retirement.
   At a recent date at the Concord Pavilion, Owens took the stage
after Yoakam played several numbers and charged an otherwise
nonplussed audience, prompting this review by Joel Selvin of the
San Francisco Chronicle:
   ``Giving Buck Owens a guest spot on his current tour gave the
old pro a chance to blast out of retirement like a detonating
grenade and show the young upstart to be the bogus dilettante he
is.''
   Ouch.
   Lucky for Yoakam that scores of reviews since he came on the
scene three years ago have been a tad more adoring.
   Many say he is the best of the ``neo-traditionalists,'' a
growing group of Nashville and Los Angeles recording artists who
have returned to the roots of country, shunning the easy-listening
trend of the 1970s. But the ``young upstart'' prefers a
straightforward description of his art.
   ``It's hillbilly music. But a lot of people didn't like that
term,'' said Yoakam, taking a break from the tour to promote his
third album, ``Buenos Noches From a Lonely Room.'' The tour
includes 10 dates with Owens.
   ``Neo-traditionalist is kind of a trite, fast-food term,'' he
said. ``They said the term (hillbilly) will alienate somebody. But
I realized a long time ago that I'm not going to please everybody.''
   Performing with Owens, Yoakam is living out a childhood fantasy.
The former ``Hee Haw'' star's effect on Yoakam's music is evident
on all three of the younger performer's albums, culminating in
their joint effort, ``Streets of Bakersfield.''
   Besides being musical partners, the two have come to be close
pals, Yoakam said.
   ``Our friendship is what's important, and if it's fun, we'll do
it for a little while,'' he said. ``Things aren't fun more than a
little while.''
   Like Owens and Merle Haggard, Yoakam has a reputation as a
country music rebel, turning his back on the Nashville
establishment. He cuts his albums in Los Angeles.
   A concept born in Bakersfield, Calif., where Owens and Haggard
made their first recordings, spurning the traditional country music
structure has become a tradition in itself.
   Despite his straight-faced stage persona, the 32-year-old Yoakam
always surprises reporters with his sunny demeanor. He seems
humble, articulate and polite, in contrast to early reports of his
penchant for loose-lipped brashness.
   ``I've had to learn some political lessons in the past few
years,'' Yoakam said. ``But if I was to go into the specifics, I
wouldn't be adhering to the lessons I've learned.
   ``I was and am outspoken. I was perhaps naive in expressing
myself in such a candid way. People were reacting on a very
personal level about it and not accepting it for what it was _ just
an opinion.''
   In the early '80s he became known as a man with a chip on his
shoulder, complaining to and about the Nashville establishment. He
said young listeners couldn't get a feel for real country music by
listening to the current radio fare.
   Like his earlier albums, ``Buenos Noches'' sticks to the roots.
   Yoakam has been playing much of the album's material for years.
In fact, only two of the songs are new compositions, including the
title track and ``What I Don't Know.''
   ``I think this album is a little deeper emotional statement,''
Yoakam said. ``The public's view of me _ I have to remember all the
time _ is 20 songs old. My view of myself is ancient at this point.
I've been with my music since I was a child.''
   For 11 years, he worked the Los Angeles club circuit. The roots
of his success, he said, lie in his affiliation with wizard
guitarist Pete Anderson, whom he met while both were still
struggling.
   ``He was on the club scene playing guitar. I was camping in the
laundry room of his place at one point,'' Yoakam said. ``He
believed in what I was doing musically. That moral support was very
important.''
   Anderson, who plays on the current tour, has produced all of
Yoakam's albums and is gaining a reputation as a producer for other
recording artists. The first two Yoakam albums, ``Guitars,
Cadillacs Etc.'' and ``Hillbilly Deluxe,'' went gold.
   Although he now owns a house in the Hollywood Hills and two
vintage Cadillac convertibles, one a gift from Owens, Yoakam is
quick to point out that it wasn't too long ago that he was hauling
for a storage company and driving air-freight trucks.
   ``My memory's not failed me. I worked and starved for 12 years
of my life, when I couldn't afford but one room.''

<HEAD>U.S. Troops To Get New Insect Repellent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEB RIECHMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FREDERICK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Pentagon's going to war against the
insect repellent that troops have been using for two decades.
   ``The old one melted plastic watch crystals and eyeglass frames
and left an oily feeling on their skin,'' said Lt. Col. Lyman W.
Roberts, who helped coordinate the new version. ``Generally, they
just didn't like it.''
   It also smelled so bad that ``there was a feeling, particularly
in Vietnam, that an enemy could smell you if you were wearing it,''
said Paul Klein, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research spokesman
in Washington.
   The new repellent, which looks like hand cream and comes in a
green plastic tube, will be in the hands of servicemen by next
summer. It was developed in a $4.3 million effort directed by the
U.S. Army Medical Material Development Activity at Fort Detrick,
and was prompted in part by a 1983 survey.
   Forty-five percent of the 1,542 soldiers questioned seldom or
ever used the repellent issued since the 1960s, and 62 percent said
the Army needed a better one. Fifty-four percent used commercial
repellents because they smelled better, felt better on their skin
and lasted longer.
   The old version was 75 percent diethyltoluamide, commonly called
deet, and 25 percent alcohol, Roberts said. The new product, 35
percent deet and with no alcohol, has a milder odor. It protects
for up to 12 hours, vs. four hours with the old version and doesn't
wash or wear off as easily.
   The new repellent has been tested in Thailand, Pakistan, Egypt,
Panama, Honduras, Australia, Africa and Alaska. It protects against
disease-carrying arthropods, such as mosquitos, chiggers, fleas,
biting flies, deer flies and stable flies. The insects can carry
diseases such as malaria, scrub typhus, lyme disease, dengue fever,
sand fly fever and Rift Valley Fever.
   It still will melt and cloud some ``cheap plastic items, if you
let it set for a while,'' Roberts said. ``But it's not as bad as
the old product that would make a hole in the plastic.''

   A late-summer surge in gasoline prices fueled
wholesale inflation in August at a pace matching the highest level
of the year, even though food prices began recovering from the
drought, the government said.
   The Labor Department said Friday that its Producer Price Index
for finished goods rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent last
month, the heftiest increase since an identical rise in March.
   If that rate held for 12 consecutive months, inflation at the
wholesale level would amount to 6.9 percent, more than triple the
2.2 percent price rise for 1987.

went directly to Polaroid Corp. shareholders with a cash bid that

   Shamrock said Friday it would raise its new bid to $44 a share
from $42 if directors dropped their resistance to the takeover
attempt.
   Polaroid's board of directors last month rejected an unsolicited
offer from Shamrock that would have paid $40 a share plus 40
percent of the eventual award in Polaroid's patent infringement
lawsuit against Eastman Kodak Co. A percentage of that potential
settlement was not included in the new, hostile tender offer of $42
a share, which bypasses the directors.

   ``It's sort of the oil industry's Guinness Book,'' says Editor
Mike Killalea, who compiled the facts appearing in the current
issue of the bi-monthly magazine. ``I'm very much interested in the
curiosity and the oddball. While penetration rates and footage
distances are incredible, they don't grip the imagination.''
   So besides records like the deepest, first and most productive
well, the magazine's list includes such items as how the term
``derrick'' got its name, where the first dry hole was drilled and
the strangest well blowout.
   The U.S. oil industry is generally given a birth year of 1859
with the discovery of crude in Venango County, Pa., on land owned
by the Watson & Brewer Lumber Co. The well generally is known as
the Drake Discovery Well, so named for Edwin Drake, president of
Seneca Oil of New Haven, Conn., the well owner.
   But what's less well-known is the first dry hole, in neighboring
Warren County, Pa. It also carries the distinction of the world's
second oil well, started four days after the Drake Well. More
dubious, it's the first well in which oil tools got stuck.
   Magazine editors also have decided the strangest well blowout
occurred in April 1, 1984, in Texas' Palo Pinto County, when the
Mitchell Lease No. 1 well blew and was shut quickly as a safety
precaution. The next day, however, an explosion two miles away was
blamed on the shut well. Apparently pressure built up and traveled
along a layer of rock and salt 250 feet underground until surfacing
two miles away.
   The term ``derrick,'' by the way, is named after a famous
English hangman who skillfully practiced his trade around 1600. He
was so notorious that his name was applied to anything that was
hoisted or lifted. And in oil, a derrick is the structure that
lifts pipe in and out of the hole.
   New entries to the record book include:
   _The deepest water-depth oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico: a
13,600-foot hole in 3,560 feet of water 55 miles east of the
Mississippi River delta.
   _The deepest water-depth drilling in the world: 7,520 feet, Gulf
of Mexico, Nov. 5, 1987. The hole reached 17,430 feet before the
drillship was moved Feb. 16, 1988.
   _The most productive drill bit: ``Big Bertha,'' a 17{-inch bit
manufactured by Houston-based Hycalog, drilled 18,016 feet in 16
runs in five North Sea wells with no repair between wells. The bit,
used in 1987 and this year, made more holes in the North Sea than
any other single bit. And its mark of going through more than
30,000 cubic feet of rock could make it the most productive single
drill bit of all time.
   U.S. state deep-drilling marks on the books include a well of
20,335 feet in Alaska, set in 1979; 22,712 in California, reached
in 1987; Louisiana's 25,703 feet in 1980; 29,670 feet in Texas in
1982; and 31,441 feet in 1974 in Oklahoma, which used to be the
world's deepest and may be again.
   A 40,000-foot well being drilled in the Soviet Union, cited five
years ago as the world's deepest, since then has caved in,
according to unidentified sources quoted by Drilling Magazine.
   ``Glasnost or no glasnost, it's not the easiest thing to find
out,'' Killalea says. ``I ultimately did discover that the well
caved in a year and a half ago. So they don't have that claim (of
the world's deepest) any more.''
   Killalea says he called the Soviet Embassy in Washington for
confirmation and was told to send a letter.
   ``They were very nice and told me they would get back to me,''
he says. ``I'm waiting to hear from them.''

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Declines In August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus fell 3.9 percent in August
over a year ago and 31 percent from the previous month, the Finance
Ministry announced Monday.
   The surplus in Japan's international trade fell to $4.94 billion
from $5.15 billion in August 1987 and $7.16 billion in July.
   In July the surplus had ended a streak of 15 consecutive months
of declines to grow by 3.1 percent over the previous year's level.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States declined by 12.7
percent in August over the previous year to $3.25 billion, the
ministry said.
   ``Looking at the overall trend, the volume and value of imports
are growing and cutting into (Japan's) surplus. The government is
also stimulating domestic demand'' in an attempt to curtail its
overseas trade surplus, said a Finance Ministry official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Imports surged by 27.3 percent on a dollar basis from the
previous year's level to a record $15.86 billion for August, the
ministry said.
   Exports rose 18.2 percent in August from the previous year's
figure to $20.80 billion, but declined 10.2 percent from $23.15
billion in July.
   In measuring exports, officials pegged the dollar at 133.13 yen,
compared with 150.83 yen one year earlier and 131.31 yen in July,
while imports were determined at an exchange rate of 133.12 yen to
the dollar, in contrast with 150.83 yen in August 1987 and 131.40
yen last month.
   The ministry said Japan's trade surplus with the United States
declined in part because of major hikes in imports of U.S. food in
August.
   Imports of fish soared by 105.3 percent, while those of meat
rose by 99.6 percent, the ministry reported. Imports of nonferrous
metals also increased, growing by 140.4 percent over the previous
year, it said.
   Japan measures its trade on a customs-clearance basis, which
includes freight and insurance costs in imports but not in exports.
If those costs were included in both categories, Japan's trade
surplus would be higher.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. today announced a joint
venture to produce minivans with Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. at Ford's
truck plant in northeastern Ohio.
   Ford Vice Chairman Harold A. Poling told a news conference at
Ford's headquarters that the No. 2 U.S. automaker would invest $900
million to expand the plant.
   Simila announcements were made at the plant site in Avon Lake,
Ohio and in Toyko, where Nissan is based.
   Poling said about 1,300 new jobs will be created by the project,
bringing to 2,800 the number of people employed at the plant, which
now builds and paints bodies for Ford's Econoline van and Club
Wagon models.
   Poling said he didn't know how much money Nissan was planning to
spend on the project about 15 miles west of Cleveland.
   He said construction at the plant would begin within six weeks,
and production of the new vehicle would begin in the fall of 1991
for the 1992 model year. The size of the plant will more than
double from 1 million square feet to 2.2 million square feet.
   Poling called the minivan market ``the growth phenomenon of this
decade's truck market.'' He estimated production of the new van to
be about 130,000 a year.
   ``I don't know any other state that will have received this kind
of commitment from two major Japanese auto companies,'' Ohio Gov.
Richard Celeste said Sunday, referring to Nissan and Honda Motor
Co. Ltd., which has factories in Marysville, Ohio.
   Celeste was in Tokyo for today's announcement.

<HEAD>EEC Concerned By U.S. Senate Approval Of Textile Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community said
Monday it hopes President Reagan vetoes the textile and apparel
trade bill sanctioned by the U.S. Senate last week.
   European External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq said
that the bill, if signed into law, would ``inevitably lead to the
collapse'' of the Multifiber Agreement, which regulates world trade
in textiles.
   De Clercq also claimed it would ``seriously jeopardize'' the
Uruguay round of international trade negotiations in which trade
representatives are attempting to improve the global trade system,
including easing trade barriers between countries.
   The U.S. Senate approved draft legislation Friday that would put
limits on U.S. imports of textiles, apparel and shoes. The vote was
too short, however, to override an expected veto by President
Reagan. The measure must also be approved by the U.S. House of
Representatives before being sent to Reagan.
   De Clercq said that the Senate's move ``can only add to existing
uncertainty in world trade'' because it came soon after last
month's enactment of the U.S. trade bill which the European
commission considers to be protectionist.
   De Clercq said that he hoped the U.S. administration's
opposition to the bill would be maintained and that President
Reagan would veto the draft law.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater already said President
Reagan would veto the bill if it reaches his desk. Reagan vetoed an
earlier version of the textile trade bill last year after it was
passed by the House of Representatives.

   The stock market held steady in slow trading
today, unable to break its recent stalemate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials inched ahead .18 to
2,068.99 in the first half hour of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
371 up, 470 down and 488 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 13.99 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Activity, which has been sluggish for some time now, was further
restrained by the observance of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
   Analysts said there was little in the news to stir up much
enthusiasm for stocks.
   The Commerce Department is due to report Wednesday on the
merchandise trade balance for July. Many observers believe,
however, that the figures are unlikely to stir the market out of
its recent torpor unless they contain some big surprise.
   Monsanto tumbled 6} to 79. The company's G.D. Searle subsidiary
was ordered to pay $8.75 million in damages in a major case
involving its Copper-7 intrauterine device.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .11 to 150.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .51 at 296.94.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.69 to
2,068.81, finishing the week with a net gain of 14.22 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 822 up, 582 down and 539 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 141.54 million shares, against 149.38 million in the
previous session.

<HEAD>Automakers Play It Safe With 1989 Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The song remains the same in advertising for U.S.
automakers in the 1989 model year, with the exception of a little
fine tuning.
   Only the Oldsmobile division of General Motors Corp. has created
a new campaign for 1989.
   In previous years, companies experimented with new themes such
as patriotism or comparisons. For 1989, they're playing it safe,
using standard themes to push their automobiles.
   The crew of engineers in Nissan's ``Built for the Human Race''
ads have been eliminated in favor of scenes of cars, for example.
   ``At the very least, with consistency, you're creating something
people can identify you with,'' said Thomas Healey, director of
media and advertising for J.D. Power & Associates in Agoura Hills,
Calif.
   Companies also are playing it safe by hiring the real thing to
sing their commercial jingles instead of ``soundalike'' musicians.
A Federal appeals court ruled in June that singer and actress Bette
Midler could proceed with a $10 million lawsuit against Ford Motor
Co. and its ad agency, Young & Rubicam, for intentionally imitating
her vocal style after she turned down an offer to do the jingle
herself.
   GM's Chevrolet division hired soul singer Aretha Franklin to
belt out a new rendition of its ``Heartbeat'' theme song.
   Oldsmobile is turning its advertising focus on younger viewers
after research showed its image was that of a stodgy family car.
   ``Our product was getting younger, and it was time for our image
to catch up,'' said Warren Christell, Oldsmobile general marketing
manager. ``We needed to drive that message home.''
   Slated to appear in Oldsmobile spots are actress Priscilla
Presley and her daughter; actor William Shatner and his daughter,
and singer Frankie Avalon and his son.
   At Mercury, the tag line is changing from ``The Shape You Want
To Be In'' to ``Where Comfort and Control Are One,'' with golfer
Jack Nicklaus teeing off this month as spokesman for Lincoln
Continental.
   The Dodge division of Chrysler Corp. is replacing its year-old
tag of ``It's Gotta Be A Dodge'' with ``The New Spirit of Dodge.''
   While U.S. carmakers are wooing the younger crowd, foreign car
makers have their sights set on the older generation.
   ``The demographics are changing from the baby boom to the senior
boom,'' said Gerry Rubin, president of Rubin, Postaer & Associates,
a Los Angeles firm that represents Honda Motor Corp. ``We're
tilting more toward that (older) group.''
   While its ads won't change dramatically, Honda promotions will
appear in publications such as ``50 Plus'' magazine and on
television shows such as ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   Honda television ads will continue to feature the voice of actor
Daniel J. Travanti, and the sights and sounds of actor James Garner
still will be used in Mazda ads.

<HEAD>Book Publisher Agrees to Buyout By New York Investment Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publishing giant Macmillan Inc., target of
unwanted takeover offers for four months, said today that it will
be bought by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in a
cash deal that values the company at $2.36 billion.
   The announcement came after reports surfaced that Macmillan
officials had negotiated this weekend with Kohlberg Kravis, a
private partnership that has helped other large companies thwart
unwelcome takeovers.
   Kohlberg Kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which a
company is acquired through mostly borrowed money repaid from the
target company's profits or asset sales.
   Macmillan said in a brief announcement that Kolhberg Kravis had
formed a subsidiary to begin a tender offer of $85 cash per share
for up to 26.1 million shares of the company, or 94 percent of the
total. The offer values the company's 27.76 million shares at about
$2.36 billion.
   The announcement was the latest twist in a takeover battle waged
since May for Macmillan, a large New York-based publishing concern
and leading supplier of college textbooks. The company owns other
operations that range from the Berlitz foreign language training
program to Katharine Gibbs clerical schools.
   A group headed by British publisher Robert Maxwell had been
attempting to buy Macmillan and last week offered to raise its
$80-a-share offer to $84 a share. A group headed by Texas investor
Robert Bass has offered $75 a share.
   The company had spurned offers from both and sought to
restructure itself to thwart a takeover by selling the information
division.
   The Bass group, which owns about 9.2 percent of Macmillan's
shares, had successfully challenged the move in court, but the
company said today that because of the planned acquisition by
Kohlberg Kravis it is scrapping the restructuring plan.
   Rumors that Macmillan had enlisted the help of Kohlberg Kravis
helped boost the price of the company's stock Friday by $3.62{ to
$83.87{ in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   In early trading today Macmillan rose to $84.62{.

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the United Auto Workers union
voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against Caterpillar Inc.
if necessary, but a UAW official said today the move is routine
during contract negotiations.
   The members of UAW Local 974, which represents some 10,000
Caterpillar workers in the Peoria area, voted Sunday in favor of
allowing their negotiators to call a strike if it is deemed
necessary, said Stan Valentine, assistant director of the local's
community action program.
   ``It passed our local by a tremendous amount, by like 95
percent,'' Valentine said.
   UAW members who work for Deere & Co. also voted overwhelmingly
over the weekend to authorize their negotiators to call a strike if
necessary, said Bill Casstevens, the UAW's secretary-treasurer in
Detroit.
   Members of the UAW, which represents 13,500 active Deere workers
and 3,500 laid-off workers, voted 95 percent in favor of the strike
authorization, he said.
   Deere officials and union negotiators began contract talks on
Aug. 3 and were scheduled to resume talks this week.
   Valentine, of the Caterpillar local, said strike-authorization
votes are ``something that's customarily done'' during contract
talks.
   ``It gives the bargainers an edge knowing their people are
backing them,'' Valentine said. ``It does give our bargainers the
feeling that people are behind them and gives them the
authorization to call a strike if things don't work out and the
talks break down.''
   Valentine said Local 974 represents about half of Caterpillar's
UAW workers nationwide. He said other locals also took
strike-authorization votes, but that he wasn't certain of the
results.
   Contract talks were continuing, Valentine said.

<HEAD>Mitsubishi Corp. To Market U.S. Winnebago RVs in Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnebagos, those behemoths of America's wide-open
spaces, were launched in the home of the compact car on Monday with
the blessings of the Japanese government.
   With a logo suggesting Japan's forested mountains and blue
lakes, the venture announced between Mitsubishi Corp. and Winnebago
Industries Inc. of Forest City, Iowa, had the glitz of professional
marketing.
   Mitsubishi coined the slogan Mobilie _ mobile plus ``ie,'' the
word for home in Japanese _ to try to sell the 122 million Japanese
on the American concept of family-style recreational vehicles as a
way to enjoy their country's scenery.
   The Japanese government is seeking to cut Japan's $60 billion
annual trade surplus with the United States by encouraging more
imports of American goods into Japan.
   Lauding the linkup were U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William
Verity, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and Hajime Tamura, the powerful
Japanese minister of international trade and industry.
   Tamura, one of the top political figures in Japan, came to the
lavish party Mitsubishi threw at a former imperial mansion, and he
drew a public pledge from company President Shinroku Morohashi to
go all-out to sell Winnebagos.
   ``If a Japanese trading house like Mitsubishi starts a
full-fledged program, it will succeed without fail,'' Tamura said,
asking Morohashi to shake hands with Verity and ``pledge to make an
all-out effort to succeed.''
   With a smile, Morohashi obliged.
   Verity commented: ``With Mitsubishi marketing this product, I
predict that this will be an immediate success.''
   The commerce secretary is here leading executives of 25 U.S.
consumer-products companies on a mission to penetrate the big but
difficult Japanese market. Their slogan is ``Market Japan _ with
America's best,'' and the products include jewelry, pet foods,
furniture, sailboats, power boats and sporting goods.
   The party for Winnebago was the centerpiece of the weeklong
mission, and the guests included members of the Diet, Japan's
parliament, as well as Iowa government officials.
   Morohashi said his company regarded the motor home as ``one of
the great achievements'' of American industry and predicted it will
be a success as more leisure time encourages the Japanese to do
more things outdoors.
   ``The market is very promising for the future,'' he said.
   Only in Japan could such a symbol of American gigantism be
launched in a room where the decor included bonsai _ the purposely
stunted trees that are a symbol of the miniaturism of this country
of small cars and narrow roads.
   Gasoline costs almost $3.50 a gallon in Japan, and previous
attempts to market Japanese-made camper vans have fizzled because
of the expense of fuel and lack of campgrounds for them. But Japan
is richer now, and Mitsubishi says legislation will encourage the
spread of campgrounds.
   Winnebago Vice President Gerald Boman, who had four of his
smaller RV models on display outside the mansion, said the
30-year-old company now exports only 0.5 percent of the 12,000 to
14,000 units produced annually.
   Boman hoped the Mitsubishi marketing will help increase exports
to about 10 percent of production, all of which takes place in Iowa.
   ``America has learned much from the Japanese, especially in
motor manufacturing,'' he said. ``Now we hope to share with the
Japanese people what we learned in our own experience in the
leisure industry.''
   The governor, who grew up in Forest City, Iowa, where Winnebago
is headquartered, expressed delight at the opening to Japan's
market.
   ``This is a very major step forward by American industry and we
are very proud that a company based in Iowa is leading the way here
in Japan,'' Branstad said.
   As the party ended Boman was asked how he felt to have such
lavish promotion and government backing. ``It's a great
relationship,'' he said, ``and this has been a fantastic trip.''

   The next time you hear your congressman defend
trade protection through quotas, higher tariffs or ``buy America''
programs, you might consider asking him the cost.
   It is through this sort of question that patriotic fervor, which
some people think doesn't cost a cent, confronts the individual
budgets of American households.
   Good or bad, trade protection is costly, forcing up the prices
of domestic and imported goods by amounts that might surprise most
people. By one estimate, it costs every man, woman and child in
America an average of $270 a year.
   That estimate, by economist Gary Hufbauer of Georgetown
University, is based on his calculation of a total cost per year of
$65 billion, or nearly double the tab as recently as 1980.
   How could that be, ask Americans who believe that the American
economy is as remarkably open to foreigners as foreign markets are
closed to Americans?
   Charles Oliver, who studied the matter for the Citizens For A
Sound Economy Foundation, concluded that it isn't so, that
``contrary to popular belief, the United States has become more
protectionist over the last decade.''
   He says that 35 percent of all U.S. manufactured goods were
protected by some form of trade barrier in 1986, compared with just
8 percent in 1975. The result, he says, is that Americans are
paying through the nose.
   In addition to raiding consuumers' pockets, he says trade
barriers invite other countries to retaliate against American
industries.
   He cites two incidents as examples:
   _When the United States imposed tariffs on Canadian cedar in
1986, Canada responded with restrictions on American computers and
grains.
   _When the United States placed restrictions on $50 million worth
of Chinese textiles in 1983, Beijing cancelled American wheat
contracts worth $699 million.
   The United States maintains tariffs in excess of 20 percent on
light trucks, ceramic tile, cedar shingles, fruit juice, footwear
and clothing, among other goods. In some instances, quotas are
added to tariffs.
   There are service restrictions as well. Oliver notes that the
domestic air travel market is reserved for domestic airlines, and
that only U.S.-registered ships are allowed to carry passengers and
cargo between U.S.ports.
   In fact, the International Monetary Fund in 1987 ranked the
United States as no better than average in its amount of protected
trade.
   The cost of trade protection is often obscured by other issues,
mainly the preservation of jobs. But Oliver cites a study made last
year that shows more jobs were lost than created by protection of
the textile industry.
   That study shows protectionist measures did indeed save about
46,000 textile jobs _ at an alleged cost of $220,000 each _ but
that 52,440 jobs were destroyed in retailing, transportation and
other import-dependent areas.
   Such examples, Oliver indicates, are among the more publicized.
But, he observes, hidden away in various regulatory areas are many
lesser known limitations that inexorably add to the cost of living
in the United States.
   In insurance, for example, a common barrier forces foreign firms
to pay higher state fees for licenses. Some state regulations
require these companies to invest premiums within the United States.
   What it amounts to, says Oliver, is that before politicians try
to raise trade barriers they should consider the costs of those
already on the books, including the net cost of jobs lost.

   Share prices finished slightly higher Monday in
sluggish trading on the London Stock Exchange, with the market
lacking a motivating force to spur it into action.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 6.2
points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,744.6 at the close of trading.
   The index rose as much as 9.3 points in early trading, but then
fell back to show a gain of just 3.8 points just before the 11:30
a.m. (local time) release of British reports on producer prices and
retail sales in August. The figures were in line with market
expectations and didn't alter share prices.
   Volume was light, with just 213.2 million shares changing hands,
down from 380.6 million on Friday.
   Some market watchers said traders were awaiting several key
economic reports from the United States and Britain later this
week. Others said the market remained stalled due to a lack of
interest in committing funds to the market.
   ``It's a stalemate,'' said Charles Larkum, stocks analyst at
James Capel and Co., adding that ``there's an intellectual feeling
that the market is cheap but a gut feeling that prices are going
down.''

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States increased by five this week after posting
declines for a month to total 938, Baker Hughes Inc. reports.
   The count dipped by four in last week's tally to total 933. A
year ago this week, the count was 1,108, the company said Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Ohio's rig count increased by
five and Texas' count climbed by four. The counts in Colorado and
Louisiana each increased by two, while Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and
Wyoming each increased by one.
   New Mexico, Michigan and Kansas each lost one rig. California
and North Dakota each lost two.

<HEAD>Gold Plunges, Dollar Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Undermined by weakening oil prices, gold fell
sharply Monday in volatile European trading.
   Gold finished $7.55 an ounce lower in London after plunging
$11.50 an ounce in Zurich, where trading ended early because of a
holiday.
   The dollar was mixed at the end of extremely quiet trading as
market players sat on their positions before the release of U.S.
trade figures for July from the Commerce Department in Washington.
   Zurich traders said the plunge in gold prices, which began in
New York on Friday, caught them completely by surprise.
   ``I hate to admit it, but we're tending weaker, psychologically,
if not fundamentally,'' said one Zurich trader.
   Weaker prices for oil and other commodities have calmed fears of
inflation. That has dampened demand for gold, which investors
historically have used as a hedge against inflation.
   But traders said trading activity was limited, although they
reported good demand at lower prices around $417.
   In New York, financial activity was expected to be muted through
Tuesday because of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year holiday, and
traders said they anticipated the lull would keep the market a bit
thinner than usual.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $419.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $426.80 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, gold was quoted at $418 when the market closed early,
down from $429.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.60 to close at $419.18.
   Silver bullion also fell sharply on the London market where the
metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.41 a troy ounce,
compared with $6.63 Friday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar inched up earlier in
the day for no particular reason, but was knocked back by
intervention by the West German central bank when it rose above
1.8500 marks.
   Dealers said they expect the dollar to stay in its current range
until the July trade report Wednesday.
   ``We have a serious case of the trade figure scenario,'' said
David Deacon, senior dealer at EBC-Amro bank in London. In recent
months, foreign exchange trading has stalled in the days before a
trade balance report.
   Market expectations are for a monthly trade gap of between $11
billion and $12 billion, compared with $12.54 billion in June.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6958 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6980 late Friday
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday:
1.8453 West German marks, down from 1.8490; 1.5535 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5620; 6.2775 French francs, down from 6.2865; 2.0817
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0835; 1,378.50 Italian lire, down from
1,379.50; 1.2395 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar edged up 0.47 yen to close at 133.42 yen. Later, in London,
the dollar was quoted at 133.50 yen.

<HEAD>US Sprint Operating Losses To Decline Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US Sprint Communication Co.'s operating
losses in the third quarter of 1988 should be sharply reduced from
the $165 million it lost in the same period of last year and the
$112 million lost in the second quarter of this year, William
Esrey, United Telecommunications Inc. president and chief executive
officer, said Monday.
   Esrey said that based on results in July and August, US Sprint
is expected to have pre-tax losses of no more than $35 million in
the quarter ending Sept. 30.
   The long-distance telephone service is operated as a partnership
of United Telecom and GTE Corp. They now own equal amounts, but
United Telecom will purchase an additional 30.1 percent interest
for more than $600 million in January 1989.
   Esrey said factors contributing to the improved performance were
continued growth in net revenue and improved control of expenses.
He said the correction of billing system problems which adversely
affected results in previous periods was a major factor.
   Moving customer traffic from leased lines and microwave
facilities onto US Sprint's new fiber-optics network also
contributed to operating efficiency, he said.
   ``While much work remains to be done, we are very pleased with
the recent progress we have made,'' Esrey said. ``US Sprint is now
in position to exceed our internal short-term objectives.''

   The European Economic Community
Commission will study a complaint by Grand Metropolitan PLC about
Pernod Ricard SA's bid to win control of Irish Distillers Group
PLC, an aide to EEC Competition Commissioner Peter Sutherland said
Monday.
   The complaint centers on irrevocable commitments Pernod says it
received for 51.8 percent of Irish Distillers shares before Grand
Met made its competing bid a week ago.
   Grand Met claims Pernod's and Irish Distillers' actions are
anti-competitive and violate the fair-trade rules of the EEC's
founding Treaty of Rome.
   The commission's antitrust division received the complaint
Monday.
   The aide to Sutherland said the commission will examine Grand
Met's complaint to see whether it is justified. This would involve
seeking comments from Pernod and Irish Distillers, he said.

<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in light, uneventful trading
ahead of the Agriculture Department's new crop production report.
   Most soybean futures contracts were sharply lower, wheat was
higher and corn was narrowly mixed.
   ``It was real quiet,'' said Cathy Leow, assistant vice president
for grain futures trading at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in
New York.
   She attributed most of the trading to position-balancing before
the report, adding that a flurry of selling in the soybean trading
pit minutes before the close ``doesn't mean a heck of a lot. It all
depends on what the USDA says.''
   Traders generally expected the government to again reduce its
corn and soybean harvest projections because of drought damage to
the crops, analysts said.
   But at least one private grain analyst, Conrad Leslie of
Chicago, had predicted only very slight reductions from the USDA's
August harvest projections of 4.48 billion bushels of corn and 1.47
billion bushels of soybeans.
   The new estimates, released after the close of trading, were
4.46 billion bushels of corn, or about 37 percent less than last
year's harvest; 1.47 billion bushels of soybeans, or about 23
percent less than last year's crop; and 1.81 billion bushels of
wheat, or about 14 percent less than last year's crop. The wheat
estimate compares with the August USDA estimate of 1.82 billion
bushels.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.02{ a bushel; corn was 1\
cents lower to \ cent higher with September at $2.86 a bushel; oats
were \ cent lower to 4\ cents higher with September at $2.66 a

   Armtek Corp. on Monday accepted a
sweetened $561.2 million buyout offer from its once-hostile suitor
Mark IV Industries Inc., ending a brief battle for the auto parts
maker.
   Under the agreement, which was approved unanimously by Armtek's
board of directors, the Mark IV subsidiary MIV Acquisition Inc.
will pay $46 a share for all 12.2 million common shares
outstanding, $2 a share higher than its previous offer.
   ``It's a great price,'' said Donald F. DeScenza, an analyst with
Nomura Securities Inc. in New York. ``Before this takeover fight
began, the (Armtek stock) price was in the low $30s.
   ``It's being taken over at a price 50 percent above what the
market valued the stock at.''
   The bidding for Armtek began earlier this summer with a
$40-a-share offer from Mark IV. It was raised to $44 a share on
Aug. 17.
   Neither Armtek Chairman Frank R. O'Keefe Jr. nor any of the
company's board members would comment on the merger, according to
Armtek spokesman Bob Jones.
   Merger talks had been anything but friendly. After Mark IV made
its first offer, the board directed company officials to explore
all options, including recapitalization and possible third-party
buyers.
   Mark IV filed suit against Armtek at the end of last month
charging Armtek misued a variety of anti-takeover measures. Armtek
had accused Mark IV of violating disclosure requirements of federal
securities laws.
   Jones said all legal action will be dropped as a result of the
merger agreement.
   Formerly the Armstrong Rubber Co., New Haven-based Armtek makes
plastics and specialty chemicals used in the automotive and other
industries and employs 8,000 people worldwide. It sold the
Armstrong Tire Co. to the Pirelli Group for $197 million earlier
this year.
   Mark IV, based in West Amherst, N.Y., manufactures aerospace and
defense, professional audio and information productions, and
technical products.

   Most of the Third World is turning from state
industries to private enterprise as a source of growth, the
International Finance Corporation, private sector affiliate of the
World Bank, said Monday.
   The Washington-based lending institution in its 1988 report
described this as ``a historic change'' in the global investment
climate, and said it offers ``good prospects for accelerated and
sustainable growth'' in developing countries.
   ``In most developing countries ... governments have come to rely
ever more on private enterprise as an `engine of growth','' said
the IFC report.
   The corporation, owned by 133 World Bank member countries,
reported a record of 95 new investments totaling $1.3 billion for
the year ended last June 30, an increase of 38 percent over the
previous year.
   The investments helped fuel projects worth more than $5 billion
in 449 companies in 78 developing countries, the report said.
   Investment approvals increased in every area of the world, with
the largest increase over the previous year, 73 percent, registered
in Africa south of the Sahara desert, the report said.

<HEAD>Dollar Eases in New York, Gold Hardly Changed After Plunging in
Europe</HEAD>

   The dollar weakened marginally Monday in light
trading, reflecting what money brokers called their reluctance to
speculate in advance of the government's market-jolting monthly
trade deficit reports.
   Gold ended barely changed in the United States after a wild day
in which precious metals prices tracked the volatile oil market.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $421.35 a troy
ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, down 10 cents from Friday.
   Currency traders said the dollar's behavior typified a pattern
that has emerged in days just prior to the Commerce Department's
merchandise trade deficit reports, which have the potential of
setting off sharp selloffs or rallies in the financial markets. The
July deficit figures are due Wednesday.
   ``The dollar stayed in a narrow range today and essentially went
nowhere,'' said Stuart Yannalfo, senior foreign exchange trader at
Refco Inc., a New York commodities futures concern. ``Everybody's
waiting for that trade number.''
   The consensus among foreign-exchange houses is for a July
deficit of between $11 billion and $12 billion, compared with
$12.54 billion in June. But the unpredictability of these numbers
has made many traders reluctant to take risky positions in dollars
until after the report is issued.
   In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.47 yen to close at 133.42 yen.
Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 133.50 yen. By the time
trading concluded in New York, the dollar weakened to 133.35 yen,
off from 133.61 yen Friday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound in London, where
sterling was quoted at $1.6958 vs. $1.6980 Friday. Later in New
York, the pound strengthened a bit to $1.6974, more expensive than
the $1.6970 price Friday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. levels late Friday
included: 1.8465 West German marks, down from 1.8493; 1.5540 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5617; 1.2367 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2396; 6.2815 French francs, down from 6.2890; and 1,378.85
Italian lire, down from 1,382.125.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday:
1.8453 West German marks, down from 1.8490; 1.5535 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5620; 6.2775 French francs, down from 6.2865; 2.0817
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0835; 1,378.50 Italian lire, down from
1,379.50; and 1.2395 Canadian dolars, unchanged.
   Traders were more active in the gold market, which has weakened
recently because of speculation about a renewed oil-price war.
Prices plunged in Europe but rebounded in New York, tracking the
path of energy futures.
   Cheaper energy prices could partly erase the effects of
inflation, historically a key reason that investors buy gold.
   ``For the last couple of weeks, the price of gold and precious
metals have been following the oil market,'' said Joanne Nagelhout,
a marketing analyst at A-Mark precious metals, a large trading
concern in Los Angeles. ``Oil went down under $13 a barrel and
rallied back up over $14. Gold did the same thing. The market has
not stabilized.''
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
closed at $421.20, unchanged from Friday, when prices closed
sharply lower.
   In London, gold plunged to $419.25, down from $426.80 late
Friday; in Zurich, gold fell to $418, down from $429.50 Friday; and
in Hong Kong gold fell to $419.18 from $424.78 Friday.
   Silver followed a similar pattern, ending largely unchanged in
the United States after plunging abroad. Silver eased .3 cent to
$6.437 a troy ounce on the Comex. In London, silver fell to $6.41,
down from $6.63 Friday.

<HEAD>Ford-Nissan To Make '92 Minivan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co., which holds just less
than a fourth of the fast-growing minivan market with its Aerostar,
announced plans Monday to join with Nissan Motor Corp. to make a
minivan in northeastern Ohio.
   The project, which is to deliver the new vehicles to showroom
floors in three years, will involve a $1 billion Ford investment,
about 90 percent of which is to be spent at Ford's van plant in
Avon Lake, Ohio, company vice chairman Harold Poling said at a news
conference.
   The factory, which paints and assembles bodies for Econoline and
Club Wagon vans, will double in size to 2.2 million square feet and
will employ another 1,300 people, bringing total employment to
nearly 2,800.
   Ford spokesman Jay Meisenhelder said the company first would
draw employees from a pool of laid-off Ford workers before hiring
people new to the company.
   Preparation of the plant site will begin later this month or
early October, Poling said.
   Yoshio Arakawa, a Nissan director, told a news conference in
Tokyo that Nissan's investment in the venture would be small by
comparison to Ford's.
   ``Our basic responsibility is development so our investment is
going to be rather small,'' Arakawa told reporters.
   Arakawa said Nissan will take over the design and engineering of
the new multi-purpose vehicle and supply parts provided by its
manufacturing subsidiary, the Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. in
Smyrna, Tenn.
   Ford will assemble and provide most of the components of the new
minivan. About 75 percent of the components in the new vehicle will
be made in North America, Poling said.
   The venture would be the third formed by the two companies. In
1969, Ford and Nissan joined with Mazda Motor Corp. in the Japan
Automatic Transmission Co. Ford sold its share to Nissan in 1984.
More recently, Ford and Nissan agreed to market versions of each
other's utility vehicles in Australia.
   Ford and Mazda a year ago began assembly of two cars at a plant
in Flat Rock, Mich., south of Detroit. Ford owns 25 percent of
Mazda.
   The newest project, Poling said, ``will give us an additional
vehicle in a market niche that has grown from 5 percent (of the
total truck market) in 1984 to 12 percent in 1987 and is projected
at 18 (percent) to 19 percent for the 1993 model year.''
   Poling said only styling work has been completed so far on the
new minivan, which is expected to be in production in the fall of
1991 for the 1992 model year. About 130,000 of the vehicles are
expected to be produced annually, a relatively small number
considering the size of the work force.
   The new minivan will be a more passenger-oriented vehicle than
the minivan that Ford sells now _ the Aerostar, which has cargo and
trailer-hauling capabilities.
   The Aerostar held 22 percent of the compact van market during
the first eight months of this year. General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler Corp. also produce minivans along with Toyota Motor Corp.,
Mitsubishi and Volkswagen. But the imports hold just 4 percent of
the minivan market.
   ``I think it's a great deal for Ford,'' said auto analyst
Maryann Keller of Furman Selz Mager Deietz and Birney of New York
City. ``Ford has a marvelous way of working with Japanese partners
to find products that are of mutual interest and mutual benefit to
both parties.
   ``That's something GM has never been able to do ...'' she added.
``Chrysler is still struggling to find its way with Mitsubishi.''

<HEAD>Agee Adds President Title At M-K</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The directors of Morrison-Knudsen Corp. on
Monday elected William M. Agee president in addition to his titles
of chairman and chief executive officer.
   The company also announced the resignation of William Deasy, 51,
who was the worldwide engineering, construction and shipbuilding
company's chief executive officer until Agee took over last month.
   M-K said Deasy, who was corporate president, chief operating
officer and a director, resigned effective immediately, ``to
develop other business opportunities.''
   Agee also announced other changes in senior management, which he
said were aimed at strengthening management and streamlining
operations control. M-K also started a new $45 million stock
incentive plan for salaried employees.
   Agee, who had been on M-K's board of directors a total of 11
years, was elected chief executive last month after the company
showed a large net loss in 1987 and also in the second quarter of
this year.
   Agee, a Boise native, was chief executive officer of the Bendix
Corp., when he led an ill-fated takeover battle that eventually saw
him resign. One of the appointments announced Monday was a former
Bendix and Allied Signal executive, Donald R. Kayser, 57.
   Kayser is the new executive vice president, chief financial
officer and a director.
   Under a new reporting structure approved by the board, the
corporation's shipbuilding, mining and real estate development
operations now will report directly to Agee. The real estate
venture, EmKay Development, is in the late stages of divestiture,
and has been the source of the bulk of the red ink reported
recently.
   The board also accepted immediate resignations from G.W.
Gilfillan, 50, executive vice president and a director, and James
B. Greene, vice president of communications and planning.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Expected To Drop On New Harvest Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's new crop-production estimates, only slightly
lower than predictions made a month ago, surprised many grain
market analysts and should trigger a drop in corn and soybean
futures prices, experts said Monday.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mixed Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade in light trading ahead of the Agriculture
Department's report. Soybeans were lower, wheat was higher and corn
futures were mixed.
   On other markets, energy futures finished higher in a volatile
session; precious metals were lower; livestock and meat futures
were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated slightly.
   The USDA estimated 1988 U.S. corn production at 4.46 billion
bushels, compared with its August estimate of 4.48 billion bushels.
The agency pegged the soybean crop at 1.47 bilion bushels,
virtually unchanged from last month. And the USDA predicted a wheat
harvest of 1.81 billion bushels, compared with August's estimate of
1.82 billion.
   Although the numbers reflect severe drought damage and represent
sharp reductions from last year's harvest _ 37 percent less corn,
23 percent fewer soybeans and 14 percent less wheat _ they were
more optimistic than the market had anticipated and so were
expected to exert downward pressure on prices, especially in
soybeans and corn.
   ``I think corn will be down 3 to 4 cents, beans 10 cents or so,
maybe even more,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Other traders said soybean futures prices could drop as much as
20 cents a bushel at Tuesday's opening.
   Cathy Leow, vice president of grain futures trading with Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York, said spot-market sales of
corn and soybeans linked to the advancing harvest already were
weakening the futures markets.
   ``Between the numbers and the harvest, it probably means the
market's not going higher in the short run,'' she said. ``We may
just move sideways for a while. We won't go higher, we won't go
lower, we'll trade in a range.''
   For the wheat market, which has shown some vigor recently on
expectations of rising export demand, the USDA report also had some
bullish news.
   The government reduced its projection for 1988-89 Soviet grain
production by 5 million metric tons to 205 million and raised its
projected Soviet grain imports estimate to 27 million metric tons
from 25 million.
   The USDA also reduced its projection for the Canadian wheat
harvest by 2.6 million metric tons to 15.4 million.
   But Lespinasse said wheat prices still could decline Tuesday in
sympathy with corn and soybeans.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 2\ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $4.02\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to
{ cent higher with September at $2.86 a bushel; oats were 2 cents
lower to 3 cents higher with September at $2.61 a bushel; soybeans
were 11{ cents lower to { cent higher with September at $8.70{ a
bushel.
   Crude oil futures touched two-year lows below $14 a barrel on
selling tied to the glut of oil caused by OPEC overproduction, then
rallied late in the session to finish well above Friday's closing
levels.
   Shahrokh Nikkah, vice president in charge of energy futures at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, attributed the dramatic
turnaround on the New York Mercantile Exchange to two announcements
from Saudi Arabia, a major OPEC member.
   He said Saudi Arabia asked its fellow members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and also non-OPEC oil
producers to show some restraint in their production.
   The Saudis also formally denied a rumor that they opposed
calling a meeting of OPEC's pricing committee to discuss the
overproduction problem, he said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents to 38 cents
higher with October at $14.49 a barrel; heating oil was .56 cent to
.81 cent higher with October at 41.68 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .56 cent to 1.10 cents higher with October at 42.62
cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures finished slighty lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange but well above the day's lows.
   Gold settled 30 cents to $1.60 lower with October at $422.80 a
troy ounce; silver was .30 cent to 1.2 cents lower with September
at $6.437 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .60 cent lower to .12 cent higher with October
at 69.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .10
cent higher with September at 79.65 cents a pound; hogs were .13
cent lower to .20 cent higher with October at 37.92 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
February at 47.27 cents a pound.
   The contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
stock index on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange settled .60 point
lower at 266.15.

<HEAD>Son of Carl's Jr. Hamburger Founder Ordered to Pay $10,500</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Thomason and Bruns cq in final graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of the founder of the Carl's Jr.
hamburger chain was ordered Monday to repay $10,500 as part of a
federal insider trading suit against him and 15 other relatives and
company officers.
   Carl Leo Karcher was ordered to give up the amount he avoided in
losses by acting on inside information to sell debt securities in
Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. in 1984.
   In ordering the penalty, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie
declined to impose treble damages, as had been requested by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed the insider-trading
civil suit. The judge issued a permanent injunction barring Karcher
from future insider trades.
   The case continues against other defendants, including Carl's
Jr. founder Carl N. Karcher, his brother, and various of their
spouses and children.
   The SEC case holds that Karchers, their in-laws and one
non-family official of the West Coast hamburger chain acted on
confidential, advance notice of an unfavorable earnings report to
sell securities and avoid potential losses in October 1984. They
are accused of avoiding losses totaling $300,000, and treble
damages could bring a total judgment against them to over $1
million.
   The attorney for Carl Leo Karcher claimed that Monday's ruling
represented a partial victory for his client, who maintained he
didn't know he had broken any laws by selling Karcher debentures in
October 1984. In refusing to impose treble damages, the judge in
essence found Karcher hadn't committed an egregious violation of
securities law, the attorney said.
   ``It indicates to me that the judge concluded that he was not a
willful violator of the law,'' Armstrong said. ``We're disappointed
the court found there was a violation because (Karcher) did believe
he had the right to sell.''
   The SEC will attempt to find the buyer of the securities and
give him the money assessed Karcher, Armstrong said. The defendant,
who was a vice president of Anaheim-based Karcher Enterprises at
the time of the trades, presently operates a string of 16 Carl's
Jr. franchises in the Palm Springs and Yuma, Ariz., areas.
   The SEC case, filed in April, revolves around trading
irregularities uncovered in random computer checks by the National
Association of Securities Dealers.
   It shook many in Orange County, where the elder Karcher, who
appears in folksy commercials for the 450-outlet hamburger chain,
is regarded as an American success story and social benefactor.
   The 1984 losses were attributed by some to a business downturn
following the Olympic Games, and have since been reversed. The
company made a $16 million profit on sales of $369 million in 1987.
   In Monday's case, Karcher didn't contest the facts of the case:
That he put in an order to his broker to sell 75 debentures, a form
of corporate debt, the morning of Oct. 19. That afternoon, after
being told by a company official such a sale was improper because
it was based on an unreleased earnings report, he ordered the sale
stopped. But 50 of the debentures had been sold.
   Named in the SEC civil suit, in addition to Carl Leo Karcher and
his father, Carl N. Karcher, are the elder Karcher's brother,
Donald F. Karcher, president and chief operating officer the
Karcher Enterprises, and Alvin DeShano, a vice president.
   Also Carl N. Karcher's son, Jerome; daughters, Barbara
Karcher-Garrett, Margaret J. LeVecke, Catherine Karcher-Everly and
her husband, Daniel; and Carl N. Karcher's son-in-law, Donald E.
Fergus Jr.
   Also Donald F. Karcher's daughter, Doneta Ann Thomason and her
husband, David; and Mrs. Dorothy Karcher's sister, Rosemary Bruns,
and her husband, William.

<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. announced price
increases Monday for some of its personal computers, external
drives, monitors, printers and expansion kits.
   The price hikes result from rising component costs and changing
global market conditions, according to Charles Boesenberg, Apple
USA senior vice president of sales and marketing.
   ``To continue fulfilling the increasingly high demand for our
products, we are required to pursue more costly channels for
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) acquisition, thereby increasing
the component costs of our products,'' Boesenberg said.
   The two biggest price jumps, at 29 percent each, are in the
Macintosh II, increasing to $4,869 from $3,769, and the LaserWriter
IINT Controller Card, up to $2,699 from $2,099.
   The Apple IIGS rises 15 percent to $1,149 from $999. The price
of the Macintosh Plus remains unchanged at $1,799.
   Company spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur said Apple's dramatic
growth during the past year has forced the company to place orders
for DRAMs with new vendors and to trade at premium prices on the
spot market.
   This has proven more expensive for the company than purchasing
components from Apple's traditional sources, she said, noting the
shortage of DRAMs is expected to continue well into the next year.

<HEAD>Vestar Capital Partners Agrees to Acquire Celestial Seasonings
from Kraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vestar Capital Partners, Inc. said Monday
it has agreed to acquire Celestial Seasonings, a leading specialty
herbal tea company, in a management buyout from Kraft, Inc.
   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed and completion of
the buyout is expected by early November. An earlier agreement by
the Illinois-based Kraft to sell Celestial to Thomas J. Lipton,
Inc., has been abandoned.
   ``In view of continuing uncertainties that have delayed the sale
of the assets of Celestial Seasonings to Thomas J. Lipton Inc., the
agreement between Kraft and Lipton has been terminated,'' Kraft
said in a statement from its headquarters in Glenview, Ill.
   The new deal was a victory for R.C. Bigelow Inc., another maker
of herbal teas, which filed a federal lawsuit in June seeking to
block Lipton's acquisition of Celestial Seasonings.
   Bigelow, based in Norwalk, Conn., maintained that the merger
would violate antitrust laws by uniting the nation's two largest
sellers of herbal tea.
   New owners of the company will include Vestar Capital Partners,
a New York private investment firm, and members of Celestial
Seasonings' management, including Barnet M. Feinblum, who will
continue as president and chief executive officer and assume
responsibilities of chairman of the board when the transaction is
completed.
   Celestial virtually created the herbal tea business in the 1970s
and today its sales account for more than half of the market with
their Sleepytime, Lemon Zinger, Mandarin Orange and other herbal
teas.
   Vestar Capital Partners is a private investment firm
specializing in organizing and investing its capital in management
leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations. Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. is providing financing for the transaction.

<HEAD>Former Ambassador To Ireland, W.R. Grace Board Member Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John D.J. Moore, a one-time New York City
official who was ambassador to Ireland in the Nixon administration
and director emeritus of W.R. Grace & Co., died of bone cancer
Monday at the age of 77, the company said.
   Moore had been diagnosed as having bone cancer six months ago,
but remained active until about a week ago, said Fred Bona, a
spokesman for Grace. He died at his midtown Manhattan home.
   He was with Grace, a diversified chemical company, from 1946 to
1969 and became corporate vice president, serving in Peru,
Washington and the New York headquarters.
   Then-Vice President Richard Nixon had Moore accompany him to
South America in 1958 and to the Soviet Union in 1959.
   As president, Nixon appointed Moore ambassador to Ireland in
1969. Moore served six years, the longest tenure of any U.S.
ambassador to Ireland.
   Moore negotiated an aviation agreement that ended 20 years of

   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
asked a federal court Monday to hold United Airlines in contempt
for failing to hire enough blacks and women as pilots.
   In a motion filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, the
commission charged that United has failed to abide by a 1976
consent decree in which the airline agreed to hire qualified
minority and women pilots at double the rate at which they applied
for the jobs in relation to white males.
   For example, according to EEOC officials, if United had 100
qualified applicants for 10 jobs and 10 of the applicants were
women or blacks, at least two of the 10 new people hired would have
to be women or blacks under the consent decree.
   Based on data provided by the company, the EEOC said United
received more than 32,500 applications for entry-level pilot
positions between 1985 and 1987.
   Among the 1,400 pilots hired, 75 were blacks or other minorities
and 59 were women _ a ratio smaller than the share of blacks and
women in the pool of applicants, the commission said.
   The motion also alleges that United established a selection
criteria that was not approved by the EEOC and then used some of
the criteria selectively to benefit white males.
   ``We feel that some of the interviewing and evaluation standards
were subjective and were applied subjectively,'' said Renee Devine,
a spokeswoman for the commission.
   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United, said the airline has met
EEOC minority and women hiring targets for several categories of
workers. Minorities now comprise 22 percent of United's total work
force and 14.8 percent of its management positions, he said.
   However, Hopkins acknowledged that with the exception of June
this year, the airline has not met the consent agreement's goals in
putting women and blacks in pilot seats.
   ``We're in tremendous competition with every other major airline
that has the same objective in trying to attract (minority and
women) pilots,'' he said. ``There's more demand than supply.
Nonetheless, we are making progress and taking some steps to make
more progress in the future.''
   Among those steps, Hopkins listed recent affiliations with
Southern Illinois University and Delaware State College aimed
specifically at recruiting women and blacks into United's pilot
ranks and the planned development of a company scholarship program.
   In addition to the contempt citation, the commission is seeking
court-ordered relief that includes job offers, back pay and
retroactive seniority for as many as 3,000 women and blacks who it
says were denied employment due to discrimination.
   The case dates back to 1973, when United was sued by the Justice
Department on charges of employment discrimination in violation of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

<HEAD>Company Reports $30 Million Loss For Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp. said
Monday it lost $30.5 million in its first fiscal quarter due to a
one-time pre-tax restructuring charge of $16.6 million and poor
sales of mainframe computers.
   ``Although our semiconductor operations experienced strong
demand and modest growth in the seasonally slow first quarter,
pressures on the Information Systems Group continue to affect the
company's operating performance,'' said Charles E. Sporck,
president and chief executive officer.
   The company's stock closed down 25 cents a share at $9.12{ on
the New York Stock Exchange before the earnings report was released.
   For the three months ended Aug. 28, National Semiconductor lost
$30.5 million, or 31 cents per share, on sales of $649.4 million,
compared with earnings of $13.5 million, or 10 cents per share, on
sales of $517.6 million for the same period a year earlier.
   Sporck said sales of mainframe computers were hurt by both
slowing of demand and continued pricing pressure. The computers are
made by Japan's Hitachi Ltd. to the specifications of National's
National Advanced Systems unit.
   ``The outlook for the semiconductor group is strong,'' Sporck
said. ``We anticipate continued growth in components sales for the
second quarter.''
   He said the restructuring within the Information Systems Group
will enable it to improve its operating performance.

<HEAD>Ford, Hyundai Boost 1989 Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for Ford Motor Co.'s 1989 cars and trucks will increase
an average of 2.6 percent and Hyundai Motor America's subcompact
Excel will go up 2.8 percent over comparably equipped 1988 models,
the companies said Monday.
   The No. 2 U.S. automaker and the South Korean car producer said
in separate statements that higher material and labor costs
contributed to the price changes.
   Some of Ford's sticker price increases for the '89 model year
are caused by additional standard equipment on some models, company
spokesman Dave Krupp said.
   For example, the Mustang LX convertible which sold for $13,702
during the 1988 model year will sell for $14,140 in the 1989 model
year. Krupp said some equipment listed as optional on the 1988
models will be standard on 1989 models.
   The company said the largest percentage jump, more than 5
percent, was in the price of its 1989 Crown Victoria standard
station wagon. Its 1988 price of $15,311 will jump to $16,208 in
1989, a combination of higher pricing and optional equipment
becoming standard, Krupp said.
   Meantime, Hyundai said the 1989 suggested retail prices for the
Excel will range from $5,499 for the three-door hatchback to $6,949
for the five-door GL hatchback, up $104 and $204 respectively.

   Manville Corp. has reached an agreement with
American Centennial Insurance Co. in another settlement over
insurance disputes stemming from damage claims filed by former
asbestos workers, Manville officials announced Monday.
   Terms of the agreement provide for three payments by American
Centennial, of Wilmington, Del., totaling $3.4 million, and will
cover all of Manville's claims against the insurer for policies
covering the periods from July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1981, and from
July 1982 to July 1983, Manville said in a news release.
   The settlement is conditional upon final court orders approving
the settlement and the Bankruptcy Court's order confirming
Manville's plan of reorganization, the release said.
   A fairness hearing on the settlement and on other recently
announced asbestos-related insurance settlements will be held on
Sept. 28 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York City.
   The settlement ultimately will go into the Asbestos Property
Damage Trust established under Manville's reorganization plan.
   Manville has now reached settlements providing for payments
totaling nearly $845 million with numerous other insurers.
   The Manville plan requires insurance funding of $615 million in
present value to fund a trust for compensating asbestos disease
sufferers, the release said, with insurance proceeds in excess of
the $615 million passing through to the Asbestos Property Damage
Trust.
   Manville filed for bankruptcy protection on Aug. 26, 1982, when
more than 400 asbestos-related lawsuits were being filed agaisnt
the company each month.
   A proposed reorganization plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy
court in December 1986, but it cannot be consummated until all
appeals are exhausted.

<HEAD>Board Of Trade Opposes Merc's Electronic Trading System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade has urged regulators
not to approve a rival commodities exchange's electronic network
for 24-hour global trading of financial futures and options, on the
grounds the system could lead to abuse and would be hard to operate.
   The CBOT sent a 51-page letter dated Sept. 6 to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission urging the commission to turn down the
electronic venture, planned by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
Reuters Holdings PLC.
   The 12{-year deal, which requires government approval, calls for
the Globex network to begin operating next summer.
   It would link investors in North America, Europe and Asia via an
electronic system for trading futures and options contracts on
currency futures, including the British pound, the West German
mark, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen and Eurodollar time
deposits.
   The system would operate during hours when the Chicago
Mercantile's trading floor is closed.
   CBOT President Thomas R. Donovan raised a number of issues in
the letter to the commission, ranging from the way contracts are
normally traded in the pit to the possibility of fraud.
   ``The Globex proposal marks a complete departure from the
centralized, open outcry markets which ensure the sort of honest
and efficient price discovery which Congress has mandated,''
Donovan wrote in the letter. ``In effect, Globex is an off-exchange
market.
   ``The Globex proposal is inherently susceptible to manipulation,
prearranged trading and other abuses,'' his letter said.
   ``Moreover, the CME's application is incomplete because it fails
to address a variety of compliance, enforcement and liability
issues including the applicability of foreign laws to the operation
of Globex terminals located abroad.
   ``Finally, a host of unresolved financial and operational
concerns, particularly in the wake of the October stock market
decline, render final action on this unprecedented proposal
altogether inappropriate,'' Donovan wrote.
   Reuters, the news and market information concern, will provide
the technical expertise for Globex. The Mercantile Exchange, a
pioneer in the creation of financial futures and options, will
provide the main market for the system.
   Futures and options allow investors to bet on the future
performance of commoditiesm, currencies and financial instruments
such as stocks and bonds.

<HEAD>General Mills Reports Record First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. said Monday it nearly
quadrupled its first quarter net earnings compared with the same
period last year, due largely to profits on the sale of its Talbots
and Eddie Bauer clothing outlets.
   General Mills reported net income of $289.9 million, or $3.53
per share, in the three months ended Aug. 28, compared with net
income of $77.2 million, or 87 cents per share, in the first
quarter of 1987.
   The 1988 figures included a $199.1 million gain from
discontinued operations. The sales of Talbots and Eddie Bauer,
completed during the first quarter, generated an after-tax profit
of $220.6 million, the company said.
   The gain was reduced by establishment of a $21.5 million reserve
for the disposition of the company's York's cafeterias and other
adjustments to previously discontinued operations. General Mills
said it plans to dispose of York's 100-unit chain during fiscal
1989.
   First-quarter sales rose 11 percent, to $1.38 billion from $1.24
billion, the company said. It attributed the sales increase largely
to a more than 5 percent volume gain in consumer foods and
expansion of restaurants by 69 company-operated units since the end
of the first quarter of 1987.
   After-tax earnings from continuing operations rose to $90.8
million in the first quarter from first-quarter 1987 after-tax
earnings of $80.9 million.
   Chairman H.B. Atwater said much of the proceeds from the Talbots
and Eddie Bauer sales was used to repurchase common stock, reducing
average shares outstanding by 7 percent from a year earlier.
   First-quarter operating highlights reflect General Mills'
aggressive internal expansion programs in consumer foods and
restaurants.
   Consumer foods reported gains of 9 percent in sales and 12.5
percent in operating profits in the first quarter of 1988.
Restaurants reported gains of 15 percent in sales and 10 percent in
operating profits over the first quarter of last year.

<HEAD>Government Detects Little Drought Damage to Crops in August</HEAD>

   Drought and hot weather nibbled at the
nation's corn and soybean crops last month, but new Agriculture
Department estimates showed Monday that most of the damage had
already been done in June and July.
   Officials held to an earlier prediction that consumer food
prices will go up an average of only 3 percent to 5 percent this
year, with about 1 percent of the rise caused by drought. A further
increase is expected in 1989.
   The department estimated the corn harvest, which is under way,
at a five-year low of 4.46 billion bushels, down 37 percent from
7.06 billion bushels harvested in 1987.
   The new crop projections, based on Sept. 1 surveys, were down by
less than 1 percent from the forecast a month ago.
   In May and June, before the drought tightened its grip, USDA
projected the corn harvest at 7.3 billion bushels, based on trends
and an assumption of normal weather.
   Those projections were revised downward in July to 5.2 billion
bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the
season. In August the forecast was lowered to 4.48 billion bushels,
the smallest harvest since 1983, when drought and federal acreage
curbs reduced output to 4.17 billion bushels.
   The soybean harvest was estimated at a 12-year low of 1.47
billion bushels, down 23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced
last year but virtually unchanged from the August forecast.
Estimates last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and
the July projection was 1.65 billion bushels.
   Production of all wheat was projected at 1.81 billion bushels,
down 14 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987 and 1 percent
below the August forecast.
   In May and June, USDA forecast this year's wheat output would be
up slightly. The July projection was 1.84 billion bushels, and the
August forecast was 1.82 billion bushels.
   Cotton production was estimated at 14.7 million bales, slightly
below the 1987 harvest and 2 percent below the August forecast. The
crop was projected at 13.7 million bales in July.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American
farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production
of meat, poultry and dairy products.
   Soybeans, which provide high-protein meal and quality vegetable
oil used in food processing, also are vital to U.S. food production.
   No new estimate of winter wheat production was included. Last
month's forecast, which was carried forward into the September
report, was 1.55 billion bushels, down 1 percent from last year.
   New estimates for spring planted wheat included durum, 49.2
million bushels, down 47 percent from 1987 production and the
smallest harvest since 1961. The new estimate was also down 10
percent from August.
   Other spring wheat was estimated at 206 million bushels, down 54
percent from last year and 3 percent below the August forecast.
   Cotton production was estimated at 14.7 million bales, down 2
percent from August but only slightly below the 1987 crop. The crop
was projected at 13.7 million bales in July.
   Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said
U.S. crop production this year is expected to drop to 88 percent of
a 1977 base used as a comparison. That would be the lowest since
1983.
   Crop production last year averaged 106 percent of the base year.
The record was 117 percent reached in 1985, 1982 and 1981.
   Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department's chief
economist, said total grain production this year is expected to
drop to 191 million metric tons, down 31 percent from 1987 output.
Total supplies of grain for 1988-89, which include inventories at
the beginning of the season, are forecast at 366 million tons, down
24 percent from last year.
   Wilson told a news conference that ``crop development now has
progressed to the point where production can be forecast with a
reasonable degree of confidence.''
   The corn yield, for example, was estimated at 78.5 bushels per
harvested acre, down from 119.4 bushels last year, the largest
drought-induced reduction in yield on record, he said.
   From 1965 to 1987, the September estimate overstated corn
production on nine occasions and understated it on 14 occasions,
Wilson said. In the case of soybeans, the September estimate
overshot final production in 12 years and understated it in 11.
   On the brighter side, Wilson said rainfall in the last month
``has improved the conditions of pastures and ranges, although more
precipitation is needed to restore them to normal.''

   The U.S. dollar weakened in early trading Tuesday
against the Japanese yen, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rose moderately.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar opened at
133.23 yen, down from Monday's close of 133.42 yen.
   The U.S. currency was weakening on increasing dollar-selling by
investors, said Takamasa Yamazaki of the Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   ``A dollar-selling drive in the market has remained strong since
last Tuesday, while investors haven't really been buying dollars,''
he said.
   The expected announcement Wednesday in Washington of U.S. trade
figures for July was also prompting dollar-selling in Tokyo,
Yamazaki said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 136.52
points to 27,893.26 in the first 15 minutes of trading. The
widely-followed market index rose 109.64 points Monday, closing at
27,756.74.
   A spokesman for the brokerage Nomura Securities characterized
the mood on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a ``good investment
environment.''
   ``The yen has been getting stronger, and apprehension about
higher interest rates is fading. It's the best time to increase the
market's energy,'' said Manjiro Ueda.

   McCormick & Co. Inc. has sold its real estate
holdings, amounting to about nine million square feet of office
space, to the Rouse Company for $550 million, McCormick officials
announced Monday.
   McCormick, which held the real estate through its McCormick
Properties, has holdings in the Baltimore-Washington corridor,
Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida.
   Appraisers valued McCormick's real estate portfolio at $471
million last November, shortly before the company announced it
planned to divest the holdings to concentrate on its food business.
   McCormick is the world's largest spice manufacturer, with 1987
sales of $1.1 billion.
   Rouse officials have indicated nearly all McCormick Properties
employees will be retained, said Larry Lichtenauer, McCormick's
manager of marketing communications.
   Rouse officials could not be reached for comment late Monday.
   Rouse holds about 2.4 million square feet of retail, office and
industrial space, including Baltimore's Harbor Place. The company
purchased thousands of acres of farmland in the
Baltimore-Washington corridor in the 1960s and designed the planned
community of Columbia.
   A May report by Standard & Poors listed Rouse's assets at $1.7
billion.

<TEXT>
   Some 1,400 striking workers have ratified
a four-year contract with DAW Forest Products Co. and W-I Forest
Products Inc., union officials announced Monday, in the latest of a
series of agreements aimed at ending the multi-state timber strike.
   Bill Hubbell, president of the International Woodworkers of
America-U.S., said a tentative contract approved last week was
ratified Sunday by union members in Oregon, Montana and Idaho.
   About 400 members of the Western Council of Industrial Workers
also approved the agreement, according to union spokesman Brad Witt.
   IWA business agent Bert Larson in central Oregon said the two
unions voted 3-1 in favor of the contract.
   The agreement matched one ratified Aug. 4 by workers at
Willamette Industries, Hubbell said. That agreement provided for
$1,400 bonuses during the first year of the contract, plus raises
totaling 11 percent in the last three years.
   The strike, which began June 5, at its peak idled 9,000 workers
at dozens of logging operations and lumber mills in Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Northern California.
   Only about 400 workers remain on strike, at Morgan Products
Ltd., of Springfield, Ore., and Lakeview Lumber Co., of Lakeview,
Ore.
   Hubbell said votes on a new contract with Weyerhaeuser Co. were
scheduled to be tallied Tuesday. The company's 6,000 union workers
were not affected by the walkout.
