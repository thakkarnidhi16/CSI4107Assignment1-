   Former Charleston Mayor Mike Roark will
be released from federal prison 18 days early because he has been a
model prisoner while serving time for cocaine possession,
authorities said Friday.
   Roark, who was sentenced to 179 days in prison in November after
pleading guilty to cocaine possession, will be released July 20,
said Frank Sizer, director of the Federal Correctional Institution
at Petersburg, Va.
   The former Republican mayor and Kanawha County prosecutor will
be credited with 16 days of time for good behavior and two days for
time served after his arrest, Sizer said.
   Roark, who earned the nickname ``Mad Dog'' for his zealous
prosecution of drug offenders during his days as Kanawha County
prosecutor, had just started his second four-year term when he was
indicted.
   Roark was indicted in July 1987 on 27 cocaine-related counts and
three charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice. All but six
misdemeanor possession counts were dropped in a plea bargain in
which he agreed to resign his office.
   A spokesman for the State Bar this week said Roark will be
called in for a hearing soon after his release. The bar is deciding
whether to revoke or suspend his license as a result of his guilty
plea.
   Roark served as an assistant U.S. attorney in western
Pennsylvania in the mid-1970s before returning to West Virginia's
largest city to begin his political career in 1978.
   He never lost an election and had been talked up as a future GOP
candidate for governor or Congress before his legal problems
started.

   Postal workers cheered as the city
council approved a law requiring vicious animals to wear
fluorescent yellow collars and some owners to take out liability
insurance on their pets.
   The law, passed Thursday in response to pit bull attacks,
requires vicious animals to wear the collars, which signify the
wearer has attacked humans or other animals or has been legally
declared likely to do so without provocation.
   The ordinance also requires that an animal declared vicious be
tattooed with the number that appears on the permit allowing the
owner to keep it inside the city limits.
   In addition, owners of vicious animals can be forced to carry at
least $100,000 in liability insurance to keep the pets in the city
and can be fined up to $2,000 for violations of the new ordinance.
   Local letter carriers who gathered in council chambers cheered
Thursday when the ordinance was passed.
   A Galveston postal worker was severely bitten by a pit bull in
January, and an 83-year-old man died from wounds inflicted in a
November attack by two pit bulls.
   ``I hope this action today will save lives in the future,''
Mayor Jan Coggeshall said.

   Police searching a department store for
a burglar arrested a man after the sound of his snoring led them to
a store air duct where he was sleeping.
   ``We woke the young man up and took him to jail,'' police Lt.
Ellis Asper said Thursday.
   The search began Wednesday night when the Montgomery Ward and
Co.'s silent alarm was tripped. Officers looked through the store
windows and saw a man wearing black, Asper said.
   Eight officers searched the roof and the store, a police
helicopter circled overhead and two police dogs sniffed about, but
the burglar could not be found, Asper said.
   By 5 a.m. Thursday, all but two officers were called off the
search.
   Then, a noise that sounded like snoring drew Officer Warren Holm
to the air duct above the ceiling panels over the store's
optometrist.
   Near Vincent Martin Torres' sleeping body, police found ropes, a
knapsack, and about $3,800 worth of videotape recording equipment,
Asper said.
   Torres, 18, was being held in Riverside County Jail in lieu of
$5,000 bail for investigation of burglary.

   Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, observed the 50th birthday of its Music Shed
with a 50-candle cake and a reunion of musicians and ushers from
the shed's first concert.
   Also in honor of the half-century-old concert hall, symphony
trustees voted Friday to rename the Music Shed after the late
conductor Serge Koussevitzky, founder of the prestigious summer
music festival who inaugurated the hall with a performance of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and Bach's Cantata No. 80 in 1938.
   George H. Kidder, symphony president, played tapes of
Koussevitzky, giving his reasons for choosing Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony for the inaugural performance, which the symphony
orchestra played again Friday night.
   ``On this significant day in the musical life, I have selected
to give the Ninth Symphony not only because it is the greatest
masterpiece in the musical literature, but also to hear the voices
of Tanglewood repeating (German poet Johann) Shiller's great words
calling all nations to brotherhood,'' Koussevitsky said on one of
the tapes.
   During a break in the program, Kidder also introduced several
people who had been at the 1938 performance, including three ushers.
   Orchestra members and concert-goers who were present at the Aug.
4, 1938, inaugural performance were honored at a luncheon Friday at
Koussevitzky's home, Seranak.

   President Reagan on Friday signed a major
expansion of Medicare to provide insurance against lingering major
illnesses but warned future presidents and Congresses to keep the
cost down lest it grow into ``a program we can't afford.''
   ``Every administration since the Medicare program was passed has
worried about the seemingly uncontrollable cost increases in our
government health care programs,'' Reagan said at a ceremony in the
White House Rose Garden.
   ``Whoever the president in office, program costs have exceeded
the best congressional budget estimates,'' he said. ``Unless we are
careful, it is possible that aspects of this legislation will do
the same.''
   The bill is the first substantial expansion of Medicare since it
was established in 1965.
   Major portions of the new program will take effect in 1989, with
some provisions phased in over subsequent years. Medicare officials
plan to mail a pamphlet to all beneficiaries explaining details of
the changes.
   Reagan noted that the legislation provides new benefits for the
nation's 32 million Medicare recipients, including prescription
drugs and care provided to patients in their homes.
   ``We have no real way of knowinghow much these services will
cost,'' he said. ``So if future administrations and Congresses
aren't diligent, these new benefits could contribute to a program
we can't afford.
   ``This could be more than a budget problem. It could be a
tragedy. The program, after all, is to be paid for by the elderly
themselves. So we must control the costs of these new benefits or
we'll harm the very people we are trying to help.''
   Medicare enrollees will pay for the additional benefits through
a flat increase in the premium deducted from monthly Social
Security checks and an additional sliding scale premium on the
approximately 40 percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax.
   The flat increase will be $4 a month in 1989, climbing to $10.20
in 1993. The sliding scale premium is projected to rise from a
maximum of 15 percent of regular income tax liability in 1989 to
about 28 percent in 1993.
   ``If administered with prudence, this program can povide
countless Americans with peace of mind,'' the president said.
   Reagan has long been a foe of expanded federal welfare and other
programs. However, he said the catastrophic-illness insurance is
needed to ``help remove a terrible threat from the lives of elderly
and disabled Americans, the threat of an illness requiring acute
care, one so devastating that it could wipe out the savings of an
entire lifetime.''
   The new program provides full hospital coverage after a
once-a-year deductible. The deductible is estimated at $564 in 1989
and is designed to rise with hospital inflation. Medicare now pays
full charges for no more than 59 days a year. The recipient is
subject to a deductible for each hospitalization.
   Medicare now pays 80 percent of approved doctor bills after a
$75 deductible. This will continue to be the case for the first
$1,370 a year, but above that the legislation provides that
Medicare will pay the approved bills in full. The recipient will
still have to pay any amount over the fee approved by Medicare.
   The measure also provides a new benefit in which Medicare will
pay half of outpatient prescription drug costs in 1991 after a $600
deductible is met. The government share rises to 60 percent in 1992
and 80 percent in 1993.
   The deductible is also expected to increase each year to keep
pace with rising drug costs. Medicare does not cover outpatient
drugs now, except for a few very expensive ones such anti-rejection
medication for organ transplant recipients.
   Another new benefit is so-called respite care, covering up to 80
hours a year for a nurse or home health aide to relieve a family
caring for a patient at home. It will be available to those who
exceed the limit on out-of-pocket expenses for doctors' care or the
prescription drug deductible.
   Also for the first time, Medicare will pay for breast
cancer-detecting mammograms at specified frequencies, starting in
1990. The limit on such payments will be $50 per mammogram at
first, but may be increased later if fees rise.
   The legislation is the product of a Senate-House conference
committee that met from February until May to hammer out a
compromise version of separate bills approved by the two chambers.
   The final measure passed the House, 238-72, on June 2 and sailed
through the Senate, 86-11, on June 9.

<HEAD>Ligachev Reveals Secrets Behind Rise Of Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yegor K. Ligachev, the No. 2 man in the Kremlin,
provided an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the
Soviet leadership with his description of the events that brought
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to power.
   Ligachev said Friday at the Communist Party conference that
Gorbachev had crucial support from himself, Andrei A. Gromyko and
KGB chief Viktor G. Chebrikov when he became party general
secretary in March 1985. Gromyko, now president, was foreign
minister at the time.
   Ligachev, recounting emotions and experiences in a manner rare
for a member of the traditionally stoic party Politburo, disputed
claims from ousted Moscow Communist Party boss Boris N. Yeltsin
that he had slowed reform.
   He said he had been deeply worried about the fate of the country
during the final days of Leonid I. Brezhnev, who ruled from 1964 to
1982 in a ``time of stagnation.''
   More ``very disquieting days and hours'' came when the party
elite assembled to choose a successor to Konstantin U. Chernenko in
March 1985, Ligachev said.
   ``Fate put me in the center'' of action, he said. ``We could
have made quite different decisions. And, sometimes I think: What
would have happened to the country after that?'' he told the
conference delegates.
   With the support of Chebrikov, Gromyko, Politburo member Mikhail
S. Solomentsev and some regional party leaders, ``the only correct
decision was taken,'' he added.
   Gromyko made the nominating speech proposing Gorbachev as
general secretary after Chernenko's death, but Ligachev's account
was the first to suggest Solomentsev had supported Gorbachev.
   His comments appeared to confirm rumors that circulated at the
time that former Moscow party boss Viktor V. Grishin, an ally of
Chernenko and Brezhnev, had made a last-minute attempt to secure
the leadership.
   Ligachev's statements, which were televised, also could boost
Gromyko and Solomentsev a day after they were criticized by name at
the four-day conference, which ended Friday.
   Gromyko, 78, was foreign minister for 28 years before accepting
the largely ceremonial presidency in July 1985. He and Solomentsev
have sat on the policy-setting Central Committee since the early
1960s.
   ``The country came to a crisis'' before Gorbachev became leader,
Ligachev said. He spoke of corruption, lack of discipline and
alcoholism.
   Because of a lack of frankness, even ``the party was in
danger,'' he said.
   ``All revolutionary parties that died did so because they were
afraid to talk about their weaknesses,'' he said.
   Ligachev spoke of his career during the Brezhnev years.
   ``In the years of stagnation I worked and lived in Siberia,''
said Ligachev, the Communist Party leader in the Siberian city of
Tomsk from 1965-83. ``I say with pride that I built socialism. And
there were millions of such people.''
   Referring with a touch of humor to the Russian practice of
sending misfits and disidents to Siberia, Ligachev said, ``Perhaps
we worked like that because we knew that they wouldn't send us
farther than Siberia.''

   The commander of Soviet troops in Afghanistan said
they served with honor and were not defeated, but two influential
officials criticized the decision to intervene in the fight against
U.S.-backed rebels.
   ``We came to Afghanistan not to win battles, but to defend women
and children, villages and cities. And we have performed our duty
with honor,'' Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov told the national Communist
Party conference on Friday.
   The Red Army entered in Afghanistan in December 1979, and more
than 100,000 troops were helping the Marxist government fight the
Moslem guerrillas until a withdrawal agreement was signed in April.
   Gromov, who told reporters this week that the Red Army is no
longer taking active part in the fighting, rejected claims that the
Soviet force was beaten.
   Grigory Baklanov, editor of the literary journal Znamya, said
the decision to intervene was made ``in defiance of the machinery
of democracy.'' He said some non-voting members of the ruling
Politburo learned about the decision only by reading the newspapers.
   ``I receive many letters from mothers,'' he said in remarks
broadcast by Soviet television. ``They ask, `How did this happen?
Who supported it?' ''
   Yevgeny Primakov said the decision under late President Leonid
I. Brezhnev was made ``without a proper examination of the possible
alternatives of a political resolution.''
   The remarks by Primakov, head of the Institute of World
Economics and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, were provided by the Tass news agency.
   The discussion of Afghanistan on the fourth and final day of the
conference lacked the sharp character of debates on the bolder news
media, the economy and other issues.
   But coupled with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's own
critique and some personal criticism during the conference of
President Andrei A. Gromyko _ the foreign minister for 28 years _
it indicated serious dissatisfaction with the conduct of foreign
policy earlier this decade.
   Soviet military officials have refused to criticize the orders
to fight in Afghanistan, which cost them more than 13,000 dead and
35,000 wounded.
   According to the terms of an April 14 agreement signed in
Geneva, a fifth of the 100,000 Soviet soldiers have left
Afghanistan and the remainder must be gone by Feb. 15, 1989.
   In his opening address to the party conference Tuesday,
Gorbachev praised the soldiers who served in Afghanistan, but the
criticism of Baklanov and Primakov echoed other remarks of
Gorbachev.
   ``It sometimes happened that even decisions of vital importance
were taken by a narrow circle of people without collective,
comprehensive examination of analysis, on occasion without properly
consulting friends either. This led to an inadequate reaction to
international events and to the policies of other states, if not to
mistaken decisions,'' he said.
   The Geneva agreement and withdrawal from Afghanistan ``have
become an international milestone in the political settlement of
regional conflicts, which are fraught with a danger to the world as
a whole and which hinder the progress of the nations,'' Gorbachev
said.
   He said the Soviet Union too often in the past has emphasized
military strength rather than political skill. He has been
extremely critical of the rule of Brezhnev as a period of
stagnation and corruption.
   In an address Thursday, a local party official called for a pair
of officials long influential in foreign affairs to step down
because they had been part of Brezhnev's administration.
   Prompted by Gorbachev to name names, Vladimir I. Melnikov of the
Siberian Komi region called for Gromyko and Georgy Arbatov, head of
the U.S.A.-Canada Institute for the past 21 years, to step down.
   Other Soviet officials in recent months have suggested that the
decision to send soldiers into Afghanistan was a mistake, but their
comments were in less- influential and less-public forums.

   The Communist Party conference in Moscow
generally brought praise from Eastern Europe, where the Kremlin's
new policies are pressuring leaders to reform their own countries.
   ``In Poland, in our party, we are deeply satisfied with the
course of the CPSU (Soviet Communist Party) conference,'' said a
commentary of the official Polish news agency PAP. ``With
satisfaction we receive the changes brought by perestroika and new
thinking.''
   Poland and Hungary have gone the farthest in matching or even
exceeding Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the
economy and politics.
   Gorbachev, who closed the four-day conference Friday, will be
paying a six-day visit to Warsaw beginning July 11.
   The ``new thinking'' at the conference ``creates fresh
possibilities of a gradual demilitarization and humanization of
international relations,'' Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan
Staniszewski told a news conference Thursday.
   In Czechoslovakia, where officials privately say they are
waiting to see whether Gorbachev will strengthen his position at
the conference, the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said the event
``will be an inspiration and a source of practical enlightment for
us.''
   If the Kremlin leader gets a mandate for more radical reforms,
it would increase pressure on Czechoslovakia's leaders _ installed
after Moscow crushed Gorbachev-like reforms with tanks 20 years ago
_ to adopt political change and to reform economic structure more
quickly.
   ``The ideas ... are worth thinking about,'' Rude Pravo said.
   In Yugoslavia, which broke with Moscow over ideological issues
40 years ago, the state press carried lengthy reports from the
conference describing it as ``historic, dramatic and exceptionally
open.''
   Yugoslav media pointed to Gorbachev's words that there will be
no prosperity for socialism without fundamental and deep
democratization of the Soviet society.
   All the Communist leaderships in Eastern Europe, many of them
now more secretive and orthodox than the modern Kremlin, have
followed the conference debate over the Stalinist past and the need
to open up Communist Party life.
   One exception was Romania, whose leader Nicolae Ceausescu has so
far rejected any need to reform his rigid economic and political
system.
   The Communist Party daily Scinteia carried a four-paragraph
report about the conference opening without any comment and did not
publish any excerpts from Gorbachev's speech.

<HEAD>Arias Tells Shultz That Negotiations Only Path To Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiations are the only road to
peace in Nicaragua, President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica told
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who reportedly is considering
a new aid program for the rebels.
   Arias said he told Shultz on Friday that negotiating between
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and the rebels, known as
Contras, was still possible despite a breakdown in talks last month.
   ``I am sure that the offer of the Sandinista government is not
their final offer,'' Arias told reporters at his home moments after
Shultz's departure for Washington.
   Shultz spent six hours in Costa Rica, the last stop on a
three-day, four-nation Central American trip.
   In Guatemala, Shultz met with Contra leaders. He was said to
have discussed a $30 million aid package for the rebels that could
also hold out the promise of economic aid to the Sandinistas.
   Alfredo Cesar, a member of the Contra directorate, said he and
his colleagues talked with Shultz about a package that might
include the promise of financial help to Nicaragua if the
Sandinistas bring about promised democratic reforms.
   Even a qualified offer of aid to Nicaragua would represent a
sharp turnaround in U.S. policy. The Reagan administration cut off
all direct aid to Nicaragua seven years ago and has applied an
economic embargo for the past four years.
   Adolfo Calero, another Contra leader, said $7 million of the aid
to the rebels might be earmarked for military hardware, but would
be held in escrow and released only if the Sandinistas failed to
negotiate in good faith during peace talks.
   Calero, however, described the talks with Shultz as only
informal consultations, and the secretary himself declined to
discuss them. The Reagan administration has said only that Congress
will be asked to approve an unspecified amount of new assistance to
the rebels.
   At a news conference between two formal meetings with Arias,
Shultz said the administration is ``seeking obviously to support
those who stand up and are ready to struggle'' against the
Sandinistas.
   But, as he did throughout his trip, Shultz devoted most of his
comments to comparing Nicaragua unfavorably with the rest of
Central America. Only Nicaragua, he said, has suffered economic and
social decline in the past decade.
   The Contras have received no military aid since Feb. 29.
Congress approved a $17 million humanitarian aid package in late
March after the rebels and the Sandinista government agreed on a
60-day cease-fire.
   Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, unilaterally extended the
cease-fire earlier this week until July 31, and Arias said that
gave new hope to the negotiating process, which he has been
championing for more than a year.
   The on-again, off-again talks have been held under the aegis of
an Arias-sponsored peace plan signed by all five Central American
presidents last Aug. 7. The plan won Arias the 1987 Nobel Peace
Prize.
   The five presidents plan to meet again in August to assess
progress of the peace plan. Arias said Shultz suggested meeting
personally with the foreign ministers of Honduras, Guatemala, El
Salvador and Costa Rica shortly before that summit.
   ``Now that the truce has been extended 30 days more, I'm sure
that we should take advantage of that extension and keep on with
the dialoque,'' Arias said. ``I'm sure we can reach a cease-fire
soon, and also to advance to real democracy in Nicaragua really

   ``There is no better way to resolve the crisis than through
negotiations, dialoque,'' Arias said, adding that he had conveyed
the same message to Shultz.
   Arias also said he agreed with Shultz' proposal that the
secretary of state meet with the four foreign ministers before the
summit, tentatively set for Aug. 7 in either Guatemala or El
Salvador. Nicaragua would be excluded from the preliminary meeting,
but not from the summit itself.

   State-run television interrupted its usual bland
fare for spicy, live interviews after a disgraced leader pleaded
for forgiveness in a dramatic speech at a national Communist Party
conference.
   One delegate told a television correspondent that the conference
discussion about ousted Moscow party chief Boris N. Yeltsin was a
healthy sign that democracy and ``glasnost,'' leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of openness, was taking hold.
   ``We can speak our minds openly and directly, without being
afraid of anything,'' said Ivan I. Maximov, a balding metalworker
from the Siberian town of Biisk.
   During a Friday afternoon break in the final session of the
first party conference in 47 years, Soviet television broadcast the
live interviews in the lobby of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses
with some of the 5,000 delegates.
   Most of the discussion during the broadcast focused on what one
delegate called the highlight of Friday's session of the four-day
conference, the speech by Yeltsin, a former Gorbachev protege.
   ``It's the most heated discussion we have heard in a long
time,'' a gray-haired delegate told the television correspondent.
   A studio anchorman began the 30-minute broadcast and then
switched live to the correspondent on the scene.
   Delegates had just ended floor debate about Yeltsin's speech, in
which he asked to be cleared of blame for criticizing other Soviet
leaders and saying reform was proceeding too slowly.
   The discussion spilled over into the television interviews. Some
delegates told viewers they supported Yeltsin, while others
condemned his remarks as ``politically incorrect.''
   Yeltsin was fired as Moscow party boss and removed from his post
as a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo after a bitter
speech to the party's Central Committee last October, in which he
complained that economic reforms had stalled and asked to be
relieved of his duties. His speech at that meeting has never been
published.
   Maximov, the delegate from Biisk, said it is difficult for
people to make up their minds about whether Yeltsin's criticism was
justified because his Central Committee speech remains secret.
``Glasnost must be deep; then such questions wouldn't arise,'' he
told the television interviewer.
   During the conference, Soviet television and radio provided
periodic newsbriefs with highlights of speeches and live interviews
with delegates.
   The popular evening news program ``Vremya,'' which reportedly
has a nightly audience of tens of millions of Soviets, departed
from its usual fare of dull reports about the latest beet harvest
or other economic achievement to carry extensive coverage on the
party conference.
   The nightly program normally runs 45 minutes but Friday it
continued for three hours with extensive clips of Yeltsin's address
and remarks by his critics.
   Videotape showed Yeltsin appealing for political rehabilitation,
and when there was a roar from the delegates Gorbachev waved his
hands and asked that Yeltsin be allowed to continue.
   ``Vremya'' directors apparently felt the Yeltsin issue was so
important that they continued showing the taped reports even after
Gorbachev began his speech closing the conference. Soviet radio
carried Gorbachev's speech live and Vremya later broadcast a
recording.

   Teen pop star Tiffany, about to embark
on her first world tour, says that unlike many sudden success
stories, her career has not gone to her head.
   ``I'm real cautious about staying a regular teen-ager,'' said
Tiffany, 16, who is scheduled to perform here Saturday night at the
Pacific Amphitheatre.
   With 5 million copies of her first album sold and a second album
on the way, it's easy to see how a young singer could get heady.
   ``I've had other friends who hit it big with a record or
something, and they changed completely. I don't want that to happen
to me,'' she said recently.
   Tiffany, who recently petitioned a court to have herself legally
recognized as an adult, withdrew the petition in an out-of-court
settlement with her mother. However, a legal battle between her
mother and manager is still being waged over who will control the
teen's growing fortune.

   John Zaccaro Jr. has begun his
four-month house arrest for selling a quarter-gram of cocaine to an
undercover officer.
   Zaccaro, the 24-year-old son of former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro, was booked Friday at Chittenden
Community Correctional Center and then left to begin Vermont's
special house arrest program for non-violent criminals.
   Zaccaro will live in a state-approved apartment during the
sentence. He will not be allowed to consume alcohol and must
request permission to have visitors.
   In addition to the four-month sentence, Zaccaro was ordered to
serve 300 hours of community service and pay a $1,500 fine.
   Zaccaro was arrested two years ago after selling $25 worth of
cocaine to an undercover officer at Middlebury College, where he
was a student at the time. Zaccaro's lawyers plan to appeal his
conviction to the Vermont Supreme Court.

   A Canadian who claims Eddie Murphy's new
``Coming to America'' movie was based on his idea has filed a $10
million copyright lawsuit against the actor, two writers and
Paramount Studios.
   Shelby M. Gregory, 38, now living in Hollywood, said he filed
the U.S. District Court suit because Murphy and the two writers
allegedly used his ideas without compensation.
   Robert Wachs, Murphy's manager, said Friday he had not seen the
suit, but denied any wrongdoing. ``It's Murphy's story,'' Wachs
said.
   Murphy was reported to be unavailable for comment and Paramount
Pictures spokeswoman Deborah Rosen said the studio does not comment
on lawsuits.
   The suit states that Lassine Ousseni, a Nigerian who claimed to
be an actor-producer, offered Gregory $5,000 in 1983 to write a
treatment, or detailed outline, and a story. Gregory said he
registered a federal copyright for the completed ``Toto, The
African Prince.''
   Gregory was never paid, according to the suit filed Wednesday.
   Ousseni then submitted a redrafted copy of the work to Murphy in
1986, which Murphy rejected, the suit says.
   Murphy and the two writers eventually turned out a screenplay
that became ``Coming to America,'' the suit alleges.

   Peter Garrett, lead singer for the
Australian rock group Midnight Oil, says his 11-year-old band is
finally making it big in America after passing up a chance at
national exposure six years ago.
   In 1982, Midnight Oil turned down an offer to be the opening act
on The Who's farewell tour, partly because Garrett and his five
fellow band members didn't approve of the tour's sponsorship by a
beer company, Schlitz.
   ``We had never been sponsored by anyone and we never will,''
Garrett said. ``We can't understand why someone who's already
famous and wealthy would turn their faces and names over to a
drinks company or whatever.''
   Midnight Oil, which played here Friday night, is on the American
charts now with its million-selling album ``Diesel And Dust'' and
the hit single ``Beds Are Burning,'' which champions the rights of
Australia's aborigines.
   ``We believe in the human potential to organize and resolve
problems. We believe in hope,'' said Garrett, a 35-year-old former
lawyer whose 6-foot-5 frame and clean-shaven head make him an
atypical rock star.

   Although probable presidential candidate Gov.
Michael Dukakis is still shopping for a Democratic running mate,
his wife, Kitty, has already made her choice for the convention.
   She's selected a three-piece silk suit by Boston designer David
Josef.
   Mrs. Dukakis also will wear several other outfits by Josef, 31,
during the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta July 18-21.
   ``Kitty is an issue-oriented woman and her approach to fashion
is more casual,'' said Josef, whose original name is Joseph
Prignano. ``Fashion is not the be-all and end-all to her and I
respect her for that. Mrs. (Nancy) Reagan is very fashion-first.''
   Josef would not disclose the price for Mrs. Dukakis' outfits.
His designs normally sell for $300 to $770 in stores such as Neiman
Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.
   Mrs. Dukakis left Massachusetts General Hospital last month
wearing one of Josef's jackets after undergoing spinal surgery.

   People who received unsolicited pornography
sparked an investigation that authorities said resulted in federal
charges against companies responsible for much of the country's
sexually oriented mailings.
   Indictments unsealed Friday in eight states charged 20 people
and 14 companies under a section of federal law that makes it a
crime to use the mails for advertising or distributing obscene
material.
   ``Project Postporn,'' the official moniker for the Justice
Department-Postal Service probe, specifically targeted hard-core
pornography, which depicts actual sexual acts.
   Mailings usually arrived at homes addressed to adults, children
or simply ``resident,'' said Brent Ward, U.S. attorney for Utah and
chairman of the attorney general's subcommittee on obscenity.
   ``They arrive unsolicited in innocuous-looking envelopes in the
homes of unsuspecting people who have never subscribed to
pornography, do not want it in their homes and are never going to
order any obscene material,'' Ward said at a Justice Department
news conference Friday.
   Jack Swagerty, assistant chief postal inspector, said such
mailings had increased in recent years, prompting more than 350,000
people to file postal service forms requesting that they not
receive sexually oriented material though the mail. About 100,000
of them were filed in the last year, he said.
   The investigation began a year ago in response to complaints,
officials said. Ward said it had targeted only ``hard-core
obscenity which the U.S. Supreme Court has held is not protected by
the First Amendment.''
   The Supreme Court's test of obscenity is that the material,
taken as a whole, has to appeal to prurient interest; portray
sexual conduct in a patently offensive way in light of contemporary
community standards; and lack serious artistic, political or
scientific value.
   A 1986 report by Attorney General Edwin Meese's pornography
commission linked hard-core pornography to sex crimes. Ward
restated that view Friday when asked by reporters whether the
material had actually caused any harm.
   ``I think it's an accepted fact that the depiction of explicit
sex acts ... has the effect of conditioning individuals to
committing those acts and conditioning society so that that is
accepted as the norm,'' he said.
   But Barry Lynn, legislative counsel for the American Civil
Liberties Union, denounced that view as ``hysteria'' and said it
conflicted with the First Amendment guaranteeing the right of free
speech.
   ``There isn't any evidence that links adults looking at
pornography to any real crime,'' he said in an interview later.
``It may be grotesque, but much of the stuff is just obviously
consenting adults having sex.''
   Ward said the targeted material depicts sexual acts, ``often in
a context of violence toward women and children, and often
stressing themes such as rape, incest, torture, bondage, child
sexual abuse and bestiality.''
   The officials displayed at the news conference samples of the
advertisements, which included one promoting nine ``full-length
movies'' for $79 featuring ``12 hours of the rawest sex ever
filmed.'' Another advertised ``new bondage videos,'' including
``Captive Co-Eds'' and ``Harem Girls in Bondage.''
   Undercover agents responding to complaints about the material
purchased samples and compiled evidence to search 11 companies, and
then developed evidence on others, officials said. Ward said the
companies represent ``as much as three-fourths of mailings of
sexually oriented material in this country.''
   The companies charged operated under a variety of names and had
a number of other associated companies. Indictments or criminal
complaints were returned in Sioux City, Iowa; Buffalo, N.Y.;
Harrisburg, Pa.; Tallahassee, Fla.; Nashville and Memphis, Tenn.;
Fort Worth, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Spokane, Wash. The
criminal charges were filed in the city where the obscene material
was received, not necessarily where the distributors operated.

   A World War II veteran paralyzed from the chest
down left Friday on a solo, 4,669-mile trans-Atlantic flight to the
German battlefield where he was wounded in World War II.
   Clark Harrison, a 63-year-old real estate company owner and bank
chairman in suburban Decatur, took off from DeKalb-Peachtree
Airport about 9:30 a.m. Friday in a single-engine Cherokee Piper
equipped with hand controls.
   He is scheduled to arrive at Aachen, West Germany, on July 11
and attend a reception in nearby Stolberg, where he was wounded by
a sniper during a battle four days after he landed following the
Normandy invasion.
   ``What scares me the most is rolling around in this wheelchair
and getting in and out of it,'' he said. ``The easy part is the
flying. Once I get on the ground, that's the hard part.''
   Harrison plans to fly his ``Spirit of Shepherd'' airplane up the
Eastern Seaboard and across Canada to the U.S. Air Force Base at
Sondrestrom, Greenland, where he plans to spend the Fourth of July.
   Flying by visual flight rules about 2,000 feet above the ground,
Harrison then will cross the Greenland ice cap and go on to
Reykjavik, Iceland; Bagar Island in the Faeroe Islands; Stornoway,
Scotland; Biggin Hill, England; and Aachen.
   Harrison flies in a cramped two-seat cockpit filled with his
wheelchair, his luggage, a life raft, survival kit and an auxiliary
fuel tank. He gets in and out of the plane by crawling onto the
wing, which sits about three feet off the ground, and then pulling
the wheelchair up or letting it down with a strap.
   He hopes the trip will raise money for a Center for Independent
Living at the Shepherd Spinal Center in Atlanta. He is a founding
director of the 13-year-old Shepherd Spinal Center in Atlanta;
supporters are pledging to donate to the hospital up to $1 for each
mile Harrison plans to travel.

   Soviet missile specialists arrived in
California on Friday to verify compliance with a treaty to
eliminate superpower medium-range missiles as a U.S. inspection
team made its way to Moscow.
   In California, Vyacheslav S. Lebedev, the Soviet team chief,
said through an interpreter that his inspectors will ``follow the
letter and spirit'' of a treaty they hope will further world peace.
   The 70 Soviet inspectors arrived at Travis Air Force Base,
located about 50 miles west of San Francisco, on an IL-62 Aeroflot
flown by a 10-member Soviet crew.
   The Soviet government notified the United States early Friday
that five teams were landing in San Francisco, said Kendall Pease,
spokesman for the U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency, created last
January to monitor compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty.
   Under the treaty, signed last Dec. 9 at the Washington summit,
the Soviets need not list the sites they want to visit until they
have been in the United States 48 hours, Pease said.
   Other Soviet teams will inspect sites in the eastern United
States, but their arrival time has not been relayed to the United
States, Pease said.
   The teams have 60 days to carry out the ``baseline
inspections,'' designed to verify the exact number of missiles and
related components to be destroyed under treaty.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, two U.S. inspection teams,
consisting of 10 experts each, met with reporters before boarding
an Air Force jet for the flight to Moscow.
   ``We all feel this is a historic mission,'' the head of the
inspection agency, Army Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, told reporters
   One U.S. team was headed from Moscow to the Soviet city of
Votkinsk, the site of a plant that formerly built the SS-20
missiles, the most important Soviet weapon to be eliminated under
the treaty.
   The United States has the right to keep a team at Votkinsk for
up to 13 years, and the Soviets may station inspectors for the same
period at Magna, Utah, site of Hercules Plant No. 1, where U.S.
missiles were produced.
   Inspection teams will verify destruction of 1,800 missiles and
check on about 3,200 related components, including storage and
transport missile containers and special hauling vehicles, Lajoie
told reporters.
   ``We're going in with the attitude, `Trust everybody, but always
cut the cards,''' Lajoie said.
   Over the next 60 days, the U.S. team will inspect 126 sites in
the Soviet Union, including 33 in eastern Siberia, he said.
   Soviet teams will inspect 26 sites in the United States and
Western Europe, including 11 in the continental United States, U.S.
officials said.
   The treaty allows the two sides to visit the other's country on
16 hours' notice, then permits them to wait 48 hours before giving
notification of the exact sites to be visited. Reporters were not
to be allowed to accompany the teams.
   The pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is viewed
as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which
would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons by 30
percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicated
verification procedures.

   Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng says the
government will likely extend ``a helping hand'' to
drought-stricken farmers as soon as there's a solid assessment of
crop damage.
   But Lyng said despite stark evidence of the havoc wreaked by the
dry spell, ``I think it would be premature to start putting dollars
up there.''
   After briefing President Reagan on the findings of an
interagency task force on the drought, the secretary told reporters
Friday that long-range weather forecasts are discouraging.
   ``We did have some showers in the last few days that helped in
some places and the weather's cooler, so those are good signs,'' he
said, ``but the weather forecasts indicate that it (the drought)
has not broken and is continuing and is still very, very serious.''
   Meanwhile, it was disclosed by a senior administration official
that Reagan will fly to Davenport, Iowa, July 14 to view drought
damage.
   Lyng, who heads a drought-relief task force Reagan set up last
month, said that ``sooner or later I suspect that the Congress and
the administration will see that we need to help with money if the
thing continues as bad as it's been. Just how you do that is very
complex.''
   Lyng would not speculate on whether aid money might be available
from the roughly $17 billion in the commodity price support
payments the administration requested for the new budget year
starting Oct. 1. There had been indications that because of the
drought, not all of the $17 billion would be needed for subsidies
and that the excess money might be used for aid purposes.
   ``To get into writing checks to farmers for relief to help tide
them over almost needs to await the normal harvest period so that
they can compare what they are harvesting, what happened to them,''
he said. ``At that time, we should be standing there with a helping
hand.''
   It was the fourth briefing that Lyng has given Reagan, who
established the task force in mid-June to recommend steps the
government can take.

   Sen. John Glenn has reported personal holdings

Democrat among the wealthiest members of the Senate.
   According to Glenn's financial disclosure report released
Friday, the senator earned between $1,280,906 and $2,704,480 in
income in 1987.
   His assets were valued at between $7,753,163 and $15,320,012 or
more. For 1986, Glenn reported assets of between $7.9 million and
$15.8 million or more.
   Members of Congress are required to file reports each year
detailing income, gifts, assets and liabilities. Senators were
required to file by May 15, but Glenn had requested an extension.
   The Senate disclosure forms are only guideposts to actual wealth
because the information is listed only in category of value.
   Glenn's largest holdings include interest in Florida hotels.
   Glenn is being considered as a vice presidential running mate
for Michael Dukakis.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential panel trying to resolve a
dispute between the Chicago & Northwestern Transportation Co. and
one of its unions is offering a compromise that would preserve some
jobs and prevent a threatened strike.
   The White House released a 29-page report late Friday in which
an emergency board said both sides should make sacrifices.
   The report also recommended arbitration if the nation's
eighth-largest railroad and the United Transportation Union cannot
agree on specific personnel cuts.
   At issue is a CNW proposal to eliminate the jobs of 1,050 UTU
brakemen by cutting the size of its train crews from four to two
workers _ an engineer and conductor _ in most cases.
   Spokeswoman Leslie Cleveland said Chicago & Northwestern could
save about $51 million a year by reducing manpower, calling it a
necessary step to remain competitive.
   However, the union characterized the cuts affecting half its CNW
members as a contract violation and demanded no change from the
status quo.
   It threatened to strike on April 22, prompting President Reagan
to appoint the emergency board under the Railway Labor Act.
   ``The carrier, unlike many of the other railroads in the
industry, has an economic need for relief from its present
crew-consist rules. ...,'' the board said. ``This is not to say
that the employees, alone, should be expected to bear the burden.''
   Although the board said CNW should be allowed to eliminate one
brakemen per train, it recommended that further reductions be
decided by an arbitration board case-by-case.
   The panel also said CNW should be able to terminate some workers
if not enough accept voluntary separation allowances. But it also
recommended raising the railroad's proposed $25,000 allowance to
$50,000 for employees leaving voluntarily and $45,000 for those
forced into separation.
   Company officials said they had not seen the report and had no
immediate comment Friday.
   Donald F. Markgraf, the union's general chairman, said: ``These
things work out in strange ways sometimes. We're still hoping for a
settlement.''
   A strike cannot begin before 12:01 a.m. Aug. 4, said Roland
Watkins, an administrative assistant to the emergency board.
   Chicago & Northwestern ranks eighth among U.S. railroads in
revenue and handled nearly 1.5 million carloads of traffic in 1986.
It also provides the principal daily rail service for about 40,000
commuters in the Chicago area.

<HEAD>Vice Presidential Search Dominates Pre-Holiday Activities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculation over vice presidential candidates continues to be
the hottest topic for both parties, with little political fireworks
in store for the start of the holiday weekend.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush, their
parties' presidential nominations sewn up, aren't tipping their
hands over running mates.
   Dukakis, campaigning Friday with Sen. John Glenn in Ohio, said
he would ``make a decision when I'm ready to make a decision.''
   Glenn, considered a leading choice for a spot on the Democratic
ticket, received an enthusiastic welcome from a home-state crowd at
an Auto Workers union hall in Dayton.
   ``I've been taking a poll all over America about running
mates,'' said Dukakis. ``What do you think about John Glenn?''
   The crowded cheered and whistled.
   ``Sounds unanimous to me,'' said the Massachusetts governor.
   Bush, meanwhile, was spending a quiet few days at a vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine, before heading back to the campaign
trail for a Fourth of July swing through Michigan, Illinois and
Missouri.
   What little activity there was on the GOP side was provided by
Sen. Bob Dole, who fenced with reporters in California over his
vice presidential chances.
   ``I'd be happy to discuss it'' with the Bush campaign, Dole
said. ``If someone makes that call ... you talk about it very
seriously.''
   The Kansas Republican met with reporters following a private
breakfast in Sacramento with Gov. George Deukmejian of California,
another possible Bush running mate.
   Dole, asked if they discussed the vice presidential nomination,
said: ``We indicated there probably would be one. We didn't go into
details. I indicated he'd be a good one, and he indicated the same,
that I'd be a good one.''
   Dukakis is back in Boston today, with plans to cap the holiday
weekend by hosting Jesse Jackson at a Fourth of July dinner.
   With two weeks until the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta, Dukakis is playing it close to the vest on a running mate.
   He said he expects to notify those he doesn't choose before
making any public announcement.
   ``I generally have the practice of notifying people I don't
pick,'' he said but declined to say whether Jackson might get the
word at dinner on Monday.
   ``We're going to have dinner and listen to some good music,'' he
said.
   Dukakis invited Jackson and his wife, Jacqueline, to join him
and his wife, Kitty, for a holiday dinner at their home in
Brookline, Mass., and then attend a Boston Pops concert.
   In another development with possible political ramifications,
sources said appraisals of land in New Braintree, Mass., where
state officials want to build a 500-bed prison list the property's
value at between $5 million and $6 million. That is well below the
$9.5 million developers sought when the state became interested in
the land two years ago.
   The appraisals are being reviewed by a third company, which is
scheduled to submit its estimate of the property's worth next week.
All three will be used by the state to determine how much to offer
for the 782 acres bought by two developers in December 1985 for $3
million.
   The selection of the New Braintree site in 1986 by Dukakis for a
500-bed medium security prison has been controversial from the
outset, with local residents claiming a prison would ruin the tiny
central Massachusetts community.
   The FBI is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations
that the Dukakis administration leaked word of its interest in the
land to the developers, who bought it from a church. The FBI has
said Dukakis is not under investigation.

<HEAD>Martin-Marietta Says It Bought Club</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense contractor Martin Marietta Corp. says
it bought a Florida health club once owned in part by a congressman
who chairs a military appropriations subcommittee because the
purchase ``appears to have been a good investment.''
   Martin Marietta disclosed Friday it bought the club in Ocala
little more than a year after a company executive and other
partners reportedly rescued Rep. Bill Chappell from foreclosure on
the property.
   Martin Marietta issued a statement saying that a company
subsidiary bought Fun and Fitness of Ocala Inc., on May 30, 1986,
for $200,000 ``from a group of five private investors who had
purchased the property for $175,000'' in a bank foreclosure process.
   The company said the corporation was aware at the time that
Chappell, D-Fla., ``had held a prior interest in the racquet club.''
   One of the five private investors had been George L. Dalferes,
vice president of government affairs at Martin Marietta
headquarters in Bethesda, Md., just outside Washington.
   Martin Marietta said its purchase ``appears to have been a good
investment because the property has a market value in excess of the
purchase price.''
   Chappell said Friday he had kept an ``arm's length'' away from
the transaction in which the investors, all representatives of
defense contractors, reportedly intervened for him.
   Chappell, chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, refused to discuss details of the complex
transaction, reported Friday by The Washington Post.
   But in a statement issued by his office, he said: ``If you are
going to do something wrong, you don't do it on the public record.
This entire transaction is a matter of public record. It has been
since its inception several years ago.''
   Chappell has said he is not a target in the ongoing criminal
investigation of Pentagon weapons-buying. That investigation
involves allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many
of them former military men, bribed Pentagon officials for
contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth
billions of dollars.
   The Post reported that the Racquet Club of Ocala Inc. intervened
in late 1984 to cancel Chappell's and his partner's personal
liability for a large part of their indebtedness and also removed
the two men as defendants in a suit related to the health club's
foreclosure.
   The principal officers of Racquet Club of Ocala were Leonard
Killgore and Dalferes. Killgore, a former Chappell aide, was then
an official with the Washington office of Avco Corp., a rocket
builder, the newspaper said.
   A Florida court had ruled in November 1984 that Chappell and his
partner, William W. Austin, personally had guaranteed some $172,000
of the overall obligation in the failed club, the Post said.
   The December 1984 settlement resulted in Killgore and his
investment partners obtaining the health club and its properties
for $175,000, Chappell's statement noted.
   Chappell's statement said: ``This property was appraised by the
bank at $425,000. According to public record, the purchaser sold
the property for at least a $20,000 profit 13 months later.''
   ``There was absolutely no benefit to me either way,'' he said.
``The transaction changed no legal responsibilities with reference
to Bill Chappell, no consideration of any sort passed to Bill
Chappell. It was an arm's length transaction, as supported by
public record.''

<HEAD>Tamil Sources Say Negotiations Stalled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tamil militants in Sri Lanka are ready
to surrender, but negotiations have stalled because the rebels are
demanding $38.4 million from the Indian government, Tamil sources
said.
   Sources close to the rebels in Colombo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Friday the militants were not willing to allow
monitoring of how the money was spent.
   In the southern Indian city of Madras, Sadasivam Krishnakumar, a
senior member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, was quoted
as saying the group was willing to surrender but awaited final
orders from its commander.
   The Tigers, the largest rebel group in Sri Lanka, have been at
the forefront of the five-year guerrilla war with the ethnic
Sinhalese-dominated government for an independent Tamil homeland.
   India, which has 50,000 peacekeeping troops in Sri Lanka, has
been trying to negotiate an end to the separatist war in the
neighboring island nation.
   The Sri Lankan government on Thursday offered amnesty to the
rebels and promised to conduct provincial elections by the end of
July in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where the rebels want a
separate homeland.
   The United News of India quoted Krishnakumar as telling
reporters in Madras that the Tigers would participate in the
provincial elections.But he said no decision had been made on
whether the Tigers' organization would participate in the elections
itself or would form a new political party, the news agency said.
   It quoted Krishnakumar as saying the Tigers would hand over
their weapons as soon as an agreement was reached on the timing of
a surrender and the number of arms to be given up.
   He also said a final decision would be taken only after
consultations with the Tigers' commander, Velupillai Prabhakaran.
   Prabhakaran is based in Sri Lanka and has successfully eluded a
series of manhunts by Indian troops.
   Last July 29, India and Sri Lanka signed a peace accord aimed at
ending the ethnic warfare in the island nation off India's southern
coast. The Tigers accepted the accord but reneged in October.
   The accord was accompanied by a payment of $384,600 by the
Indian government to the rebels for rehabilitation of people
affected by the fighting.
   Since October, more than 400 Indian soldiers have been killed in
ambushes and battles with the Tamil rebels, according to the Indian
government.
   Neither the Indians nor the Tamils have estimated the number of
rebel deaths.
   In the latest reported violence, seven Indian soldiers were
killed in two ambushes Thursday, said Sri Lankan military officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said four were killed
near Trincomalee, 150 miles north of Colombo; and three were killed
near Vavuniya, 110 miles north of Colombo.
   Two Tamils were killed in Vavuniya during search operations
launched Friday by the Indians, the officials said.
   The Tamil insurgency grew out of the belief the community was
being discriminated against by the Sinhalese ethnic majority, which
controls the country's government and armed forces.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
the Sinhalese form 75 percent. Most Tamils are Hindus, like the
majority of Indians, while most Sinhalese are Buddhists.
   India became involved in the Sri Lankan ethnic strife because of
the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause.

<BYLINE>Brazil Steeps its New Constitution in Controversy
^By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National lawmakers are preparing
for final voting on the draft of a new constitution that would
reject sweeping land reform but liberalize work rules and end
foreign control of mining.
   The new charter for South America's largest country would also
give President Jose Sarney and his successors a five-year term, a
victory for the national leader.
   The proposed document was born in five months of heated debate
in the Congress, doubling as a Constitutional Convention. It has
come up 235 articles that will be the basis for the eighth
constitution in the 166 years of Brazil's independence from
Portugal.
   The final round of voting is expected to start near the end of
July. But the document appears largely to have assumed its final
form because a hefty 280 votes in the 559-member convention would
be needed to change it.
   The convention, made up of representatives and senators picked
in free elections in 1986, began rewriting the current
constitution, dictated during a 1964-1985 military regime, in
February 1987.
   The project started with a computer-generated document touching
nearly every aspect of life imaginable in this country of about 140
million people. It then progressed to a first draft of more than
3,000 articles, which critics derided as an ``encyclopedia.''
   The real paring began last February with article-by-article
voting, in which a majority of 280 was needed for approval.
Lawmakers debated vociferously, sometimes violently, especially
about issues like land reform, workers' rights and the role of
foreign capital.
   Other hotly contested matters involved how long Sarney, the
civilian who assumed office in 1985, should stay there; and whether
Brazil should have a U.S.-type presidential form of government or a
European-style prime minister system.
   As it stands, the proposed constitution contains these
provisions:
   _ Sarney and future presidents will serve for five years,
compared to the six years of former military presidents. The
presidential system remains in place.
   _ Wide-ranging land reform, in a country where 4 percent of the
people own 50 percent of the farmable land, was rejected.
   _ Workers appear headed for a shorter work week and more liberal
vacation benefits. But a liberal maternity leave program might not
survive the final vote because businesses view it as too expensive.
   _ Foreign companies involved in mining will have to leave Brazil
in four years or transfer financial control to residents of the
country.
   _ Risk contracts allowing foreign companies to drill for oil
probably won't be continued.
   _ The return of legalized casino gambling was rejected.
   The biggest fight broke out between Sarney and convention
members over the length of the presidential term.
   Tancredo Neves, a moderate who said he wanted only four years as
president before holding elections, died before taking office in
1985. Brazil's last presidential election was in 1960. Sarney, vice
president-elect and former chief of the military regime's official
party, moved into the presidency.
   He made it clear he believed he had inherited the six-year term
of his military predecessor, Gen. Joao Figueiredo, but said he
would consider stepping down after five years.
   However, many congressmen wanted Sarney out after four years,
with presidential elections in November 1988.
   Sarney won his five years in the constitutional debating, but at
the cost of splitting his Brazilian Democratic Movement party.
   Various groups are still seeking changes in the final form of
the document.
   A conservative block, known as the ``Big Center,'' is trying to
gain support to strike the anti-foreign articles involving mining
and oil prospecting and a proposition allowing civil servants
strike under certain circumstances.
   Leftists, including members of Brazil's two small Communist
parties, want to try to knock out conservative provisions on land
reform and one that lets civilian powers call in the armed forces
to deal with internal problems.
   There is no time limit for the last round of debate.
   But Rep. Ulysses Guimaraes, speaker of Brazil's House and
president of the constitutional convention, says he would like
officially to proclaim the new constitution on Sept. 7, the
national holiday that commemmorates independence.

<TEXT>
   Five firemen killed when a burning roof
collapsed onto them were like ``family'' in this city, which had
never had a firefighter die in the line of duty.
   ``There are only 100 of us in this department and this is just a
small place,'' Fire Chief Anthony Aiellos said Friday. ``In a town
like this these are your friends.''
   ``It's a sad day in Hackensack,'' added Mayor Fred Cerbo.
``We've never had anything like this in our city before. To have
five firemen die is just incredible.''
   The fire, which destroyed the building and contents of a car
dealership, started shortly after 3 p.m. Friday in the rear service
section of the building, Aiellos said.
   The ceiling collapsed as the firefighters, who were inside the
building, were cutting a hole in it to get a hose on flames in a
space between the ceiling and the roof, Aiellos said. The five were
killed almost instantly.
   ``All of a sudden the entire 60 foot square inside ceiling fell
on them,'' he said, adding that four other firefighters inside at
the time escaped injury.
   The fire apparently started in the space between the ceiling and
roof above the dealership's service area, Aiellos said. The men
were spraying the space to try to create a ``fog'' to decrease the
fire's heat, he said.
   ``They did what they were supposed to do,'' Aiellos said.
   All of Hackensack's 100 firefighters as well as units from
surrounding towns responded to the blaze, which was under control
by 6:30 p.m.
   Later, fire investigators picked through the debris. But the
roof collapse may make it impossible to find the exact cause,
Aiellos said. A damage estimate was not immediately available.
   Hundreds of bystanders watched along the busy intersection in
this New York suburb of 40,000 people while the firefighters'
bodies were placed in ambulances. Many clutched friends when
stretchers bearing the bodies came briefly into view.
   The victims were Capt. Richard Williams, 54, Lt. Richard
Reinhogen, 48, and firefighters William Krejsa, 52, Leonard
Radumski 38, and Stephen Ennis, 30. All five were from Hackensack.
   All the employees of Hackensack Ford were evacuated without
injuries, police said. There were no other firefighters injured.
   Cerbo said a memorial service would be held next week. Aiellos
planned to meet with the families today after autopsies are
performed.
   ``These were good men,'' he said. ``And there are a lot of
kids.''
   The fatalities were the first deaths in action in Hackensack
Fire Department history, Aiellos said.
   Hackensack, only four square miles in size, has many longtime
residents who will be hit hard by the deaths, he said.
   At the department's headquarters, a wreath and an American flag
at half- staff paid tribute to the victims.
   ``It was like losing a member of your family,'' firefighter Tom
Canzanella said.

<HEAD>PAYMENTS SUSPENDED</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, declaring ``we do not need to
wait (for) convictions, or even trials,'' in the Pentagon
procurement affair, suspended payment on $1 billion worth of
potentially tainted military contracts.
   Carlucci acted on the basis of information included in
search-warrant affidavits that were unsealed by a federal
magistrate in Dallas on Thursday. In the documents, the FBI said it
eavesdropped as one consultant obtained and passed along inside
information on nine contracts worth more than $522 million. They
heard a Navy procurement official read off 10 sealed bids in a $120
million contract.
   Carlucci also announced that the Pentagon was beginning
suspension procedures against three individuals and a company named
in the documents.

``numerous subpoenas'' issued in the case. The Justice Department,
meanwhile, took steps to ensure that no additional affidavits or

<HEAD>Government To Continue Program To Develop Artificial Heart</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health plans to
continue a $20 million artificial heart research program that had
been scheduled to be shelved in the fall, according to Senate and
administration officials.
   The reversal means that research contracts at centers in six
states won't be halted at the end of September, but rather will
continue for about 5{ years as originally planned. The program's
goal is to develop a totally implantable electric heart.
   The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, part of NIH, said
in May that it was suspending the program at the end of the fiscal
year and shifting its focus instead to developing a left
ventricular assist device, which would help a diseased heart pump
blood.
   The decision provoked an outcry from senators in the states
where the research centers are located. They called the decision
``an alarming U-turn'' and said the artificial heart program was a
key component of the nation's leadership in biotechnology.
   Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., had
threatened in a letter to insert an amendment into an
appropriations bill to compel the heart, lung and blood institute
to continue the contracts prior to undertaking new obligations.
   Word that the contracts were being revived first came from
Hatch, who relayed the news to a Utah center with a $5.5 million
contract at stake.
   ``We heard and confirmed that the contract had been reinstated
as of the end of the fiscal year, so that there will be no
(funding) break,'' Roger Bliss of the University of Utah's
Institute for Biomedical Engineering said in a telephone interview
Friday.
   ``It was originally announced by Senator Hatch and confirmed
through our contacts at NIH,'' Bliss said.
   Hatch told The Deseret News in Utah that he was told by Claude
Lenfant, director of the NIH institute, that artificial heart
funding was being restored. Hatch called the decision ``good news
for the millions who will need artificial hearts or their
components.''
   There has been no announcement yet by NIH that the program is
being resumed.
   However, an NIH official speaking on condition of anonymity
said, ``The practicality is that a decision has been made'' and
that an announcement was expected as soon as next week.
   The official stressed that the decision was not just a quick
fix, and that it was anticipated that the program would continue as
originally planned.
   Besides the University of Utah, the other centers conducting the
research are the Hershey Medical Center of Pennsylvania State
University; Abiomed Inc. of Danvers, Mass., which is working with
the Texas Heart Institute of Houston; and the Nimbus Co. of Rancho
Cordova, Calif., which is working with the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
   The contracts begin early this year. In announcing that the
pacts were being suspended, the NIH institute cited budgetary
constraints and said it was not abandoning the total artificial
heart concept.
   So far, all five patients who received the Jarvik-7 artificial
heart as a permanent implantation have died within two years. The
Jarvik-7 runs on compressed air and uses a portable power pack or
other external machine. The program temporarily suspended by NIH is
for development of an electric, totally implantable heart.

<HEAD>Radical Changes In Schools Needed, Teacher Association Leader Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Convention opens at 12:30 p.m. EDT; No PMs lead planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite rising teacher pay, the president
of the American Federation of Teachers warns that rough days lie
ahead for public schools unless there are radical changes in the
nation's education system.
   Albert Shanker said he would deliver that message in his keynote
address today to 3,000 AFT delegates at the start of their biennial
convention.
   Shanker's union released a report Friday that indicated U.S.
teacher salaries are at a record high _ $28,085 on average in
1987-88 _ and starting pay is up to $18,557 on average.
   But Shanker, an outspoken critic of traditional school
structures, argues that schools fail to deliver an adequate
education to 80 percent of all students. He recently proposed
allowing groups of six to 12 teachers experiment with running their
own schools-within-schools.
   He said in an interview that if teachers don't take the lead in
persuading the public to restructure schools, ``we're going to end
up being dismantled out of existence.''
   At a meeting of local AFT presidents Friday, Patrick O'Rourke,
president of the union's innovative Hammond, Ind., local, suggested
that the union convene a special conference next summer to look at
its own structure.
   ``Maybe we need to take a real, hard look at the union from the
bottom up,'' O'Rourke said. ``Even the Soviet Republic is doing
that.''
   Two AFT vice presidents, Sandra Feldman, the head of New York's
United Federation of Teachers, and Edward McElroy, head of the
Rhode Island federation, told the 125 local presidents that the
Executive Council already is doing some self-examination.
   The delegates will vote Sunday on whether to expand the council
from 36 to 40 members.
   Shanker, 59, president of the nation's second-largest teachers
union since 1974, is running for re-election Monday with no
announced opposition.
   The 665,000-member AFT represents nearly a half-million of the
nation's 2.4 million public school teachers, primarily in big
cities. The 1.9 million-member National Education Association,
which opens its convention Monday in New Orleans, is the nation's
largest teachers union with 1.5 million teachers.
   McElroy distributed a letter he sent to Shanker in January
urging a wide-ranging review of the union. ``We seem to take for
granted that the people who have led our unions for the past 20
years will always be there,'' he wrote.
   The AFT salary report singled out Connecticut as the state with
the biggest increase in average salaries last year: 15.8 percent to
$33,776, fifth in the nation.
   The highest-paid teachers are in Alaska, where they received
$40,510 on average; the lowest-paid are in Arkansas, with an
average of $20,340 last year, the AFT said.
   The report said teachers earned 17 percent more on average than
all American workers in 1987 and 10 percent more than all
government workers.
   On Tuesday, the delegates will hear from Democratic presidential
candidates Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson via a satellite
television hookup.
   Also on the convention's agenda is the consideration of several
resolutions, including one that would put the union on record as
opposing standardized tests for kindergarten students.

   A former Kuwait Airways sales manager has been
sentenced to six months in prison for stealing $2.5 million from
the airline in what the defendant claimed was a plan with the CIA
to woo moderates in Iran.
   But the federal prosecutor in the case immediately criticized
Friday's decision by U.S. District Judge George Revercomb who
acknowledged the sentence ``will strike some as extremely lenient.''
   Robert M. Sensi received a three-year sentence with all but six
months suspended for 21 counts of mail fraud, theft and interstate
transportation of stolen securities.
   A further order credited Sensi with the four months he spent in
a British jail following his 1986 arrest which means he will only
serve two months.

<HEAD>Reagan To Nominate Stalon To Additional Time On FERC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House has announced that President
Reagan intends to nominate Charles Stalon, a holdover member of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to serve additional time on
the commission.
   Stalon, 58, filled an unexpired term when he came to the
commission in 1984. That term ran out last October, but the law
permits him to stay on for a year as long as no successor has been
sworn in.
   Friday's announcement said Stalon, who fills one of the two
mandatory Democratic seats, would fill the remainder of Michael
Naeve's term which would have expired in October 1989 had he not
resigned in March.
   The commission's membership remains uncertain because Martha O.
Hesse has not been confirmed as chairman a year after her
nomination, Anthony Sousa has resigned effective later this month
and Charles Trabandt's term expires in October.

   Maoist guerrillas and police fought a
gunbattle aboard an interstate bus carrying 80 passengers, killing
three people, police said.
   A policeman, a Shining Path rebel and a bus passenger were
killed and another policeman was wounded in Friday's shootout,
police said.
   The violence occurred before dawn on Peru's major coastal route
near Pisco, 135 miles south of Lima. The bus was traveling along
the Pan American Highway to Lima from Ica, 180 miles south.
   Police said six Shining Path guerrillas forced the privately
owned bus to stop by firing machine guns into the air and boarded
the vehicle, demanding to see the passengers' papers.
   The bus riders dived for cover behind their seats as two
policemen passengers opened fire. The rebels fired back and fled
moments later.
   Maoist guerrillas frequently halt buses and steal passengers'
valuables as an ``insurgency tax.'' The rebels normally check
documents and kill any police or government officials they find.
   The government says nearly 600 policemen have been among the
more than 10,000 people slain in violence related to the Shining
Path's eight-year fight to impose Marxist rule in Peru.

<HEAD>Popular Brazilian Television Star Was Known for Wild Antics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abelardo Barbosa, a free-wheeling
comic who liked to say his goal was to confuse everything but who
worked to forge a distinctly Brazilian style of television, died of
a heart attack. He was 70.
   Barbosa, known on his amateur hour as ``Chacrinha,'' or barnyard
in Portuguese, succumbed at his home in Rio de Janeiro late
Thursday, his family announced Friday. He had been ill for several
months.
   His body lay in state Friday at City Hall, where hundreds of
fans and well-wishers, mostly poor, lined up to pay respects. Riot
police took positions outside to prevent any emotional tumult among
mourners.
   The entertainer was born in Brazil's poor northeast region and
graduated from medical school there. But he never practiced as a
doctor, gravitating in the 1940s to Rio de Janeiro and radio. He
became a disc jockey and emcee.
   The entertainer delighted generations of Brazilian radio and
television fans with his own brand of unpredictable antics.
   When television came to Brazil in the 1960s, Barbosa became a
legend with a amateur show called ``Chacrinha's Horn.''
   His nonsense slogans and silly rhymes caught on throughout the
country. Media critics said he represented the essence of
``Brazilian-ness'' and prevented television here from turning into
an American clone.
   In a rare serious moment in an interview years ago, Barbosa said
he felt he had brought a certain Brazilian originality to
television, which he viewed as subject to foreign _ mostly American
_ influence.
   On ``Chacrinha's Horn,'' Chacrinha, an overweight man with thick
glasses and curly, white hair, generally sported an outlandish
outfit making him look like a clown. If he did not appreciate
performers, he would honk a horn in their faces and send them away
in disgrace, prompting thunderous laughter from the audience.
   The program also highlighted Brazil's leading pop music singers
and rock groups. Go-go girls gyrated in the background, smoke bombs
exploded on stage, and cameras cut crazily from one shot to another
with no apparent logic.
   ``I've come here to confuse everything,'' he often said in
nose-tight closeups, and the phrase caught on nationwide.
   He also delighted fans with such gratuitous behavior as
brandishing a pineapple or a slab of dried codfish and taunting the
audience: ``Who wants this?''
   ``Me, me,'' everyone would shout.
   ``Well, you can't have it. This stuff's expensive,'' he would
retort and lob the item out of reach.

<HEAD>Melvin Belli's Wife Asking To End Marriage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of attorney Melvin Belli says she
wants to end her stormy marriage to the famed ``King of Torts,''
alleging he beat her and falsely accused her of having affairs with
several celebrities.
   Lia Belli, 39, an unsuccessful state Senate candidate in 1984,
also accused her 80-year-old husband on Friday of briefly choking
their 15-year-old daughter after he became enraged when his dogs
were not allowed to roam their $6 million mansion.
   Belli on Friday cut short a three-week tour of the Soviet Union
to return to San Francisco, according to a spokeswoman in his
office, adding he could not be reached for comment.
   Mrs. Belli, who told police Tuesday an armed intruder fired two
shots at her in her bedroom at 5 a.m., said she wants a legal
separation and will seek a court order barring her husband from
their home.
   ``When neither side is happy, the marriage should end quickly,''
she said. ``My heart is broken that throughout this whole thing he
still hasn't called me.''
   She said she believed a ``hit man ... a daring professional''
was trying to kill her, emphasizing she did not think her husband
was behind the attack.
   She claimed her stepson Caesar Belli and his wife, Gretchen,
have undermined her 16-year marriage by calling gossip columnists
to report various affairs and by making such suggestions to her
husband.
   Mrs. Belli and her friends said she was unable to model a
low-cut gown at a local fashion show last November because of
bruises around her upper chest and neck area and cuts on her arms.
   Mrs. Belli alleged her husband, angered by a phone call from his
son about a legal matter, ``grabbed me by both arms and twirled me
around and I hit the mirror,'' causing the cuts and bruises.

<TEXT>
   A Panamanian ship believed to be carrying more
than 50 tons of marijuana was under tow today after the Coast Guard
opened fire on the vessel, boarded it and arrested the crew, the
Coast Guard said.
   The ``Encounter Bay,'' a 180-foot converted oil-drilling vessel,
was seized Thursday after it refused to stop and was expected to
reach Seattle on Wednesday, Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Eldo DeLong
said Friday.
   A patrolling Coast Guard C-130 aircraft spotted the ship
Thursday several hundred miles off the Washington coast in
international waters, said Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer 1st
Class Craig Herlihy.
   The ship's home port on the stern was partly covered with white
paint, DeLong said.
   Because the vessel was suspicious-looking, the U.S. State
Department contacted the Panamanian embassy and got permission to
board the ship and enforce U.S. laws, DeLong said.
   Crew members aboard the Coast Guard cutter ``Boutwell'' tried to
contact the master of the vessel by radio, flag hoist, and waving,
Herlihy said. When those methods failed, the Boutwell fired 60
rounds of .50-caliber bullets into the vessel's engine room. No one
was injured, and there was no further resistance, he said.
   Damage to the vessel was minimal, DeLong said.
   Coast Guard crew members then boarded the vessel and immediately
found four containers of marijuana on deck, DeLong said.
   ``There is believed to be in excess of 50 tons of marijuana
(aboard),'' Lt. Paul Ferguson said.
   The seizure, worth an estimated $220 million, is one of the
largest ever for the Coast Guard, Herlihy said. Authorities in 1985
seized 160 tons of marijuana off the coast of Virginia.
   All the crew members on board were arrested, DeLong said, adding
that he did not know how many crew members there were.
   The crew members will be taken into U.S. Customs custody when
the vessel arrives in port, Ferguson said. Coast Guard, Customs and
drug enforcement officials will examine the ship and its cargo.
   The Coast Guard began towing the ship Thursday night, and
Herlihy estimated the vessels would be traveling at six to eight
knots, or seven to 10 mph.

<TEXT>
   Americans planned parades, food fests and fireworks for the
Fourth of July weekend, but the nation's worst drought in decades
put a damper on many pyrotechnic displays because of fears of
wildfires.
   And in Miami, authorities issued a weekend warning as millions
of mosquitoes swept into the area from the Everglades.
   Organizers in St. Louis expected more than 3 million visitors
for the annual VP Fair, billed as ``America's largest birthday
party.''
   Nine stages scattered across the St. Louis Arch grounds will be
used by entertainers ranging from Glen Campbell to Chinese
acrobats. Vice President George Bush is scheduled to speak at
naturalization ceremonies for 300 people.
   The three-day fair also includes today's annual Veiled Prophet
Parade _ staged by a secret social group, the Veiled Prophet
Organization _ airshows, a hot air ``Balloonfest,'' an
Olympic-qualifying bicycle race, a steamboat race, ethnic food and
nightly fireworks displays.
   But in other parts of the Midwest and elsewhere, Independence
Day revelers will have to find alternatives to fireworks due to
bans spurred by the dry weather.
   On Tuesday, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson signed an executive
order banning private fireworks displays _ even sparklers. But
local governments may make exceptions where conditions allow, and
community fireworks will be permitted as long as there is adequate
fire protection.
   Counties and communities in Iowa, North Dakota, Kentucky,
California and elsewhere also banned or restricted fireworks out of
fear of setting grass and forest fires.
   ``The potential is there for a disaster this year,'' said Les
Parr, a Riverside County, Calif., fire prevention officer. ``The
brush is dry and well-cured and the danger and potential for fires
is a lot greater.''
   But several Kansas communities that had banned fireworks
rescinded the bans after rain fell Thursday, easing the drought.
   Independence, Mo., came up with a novel way of celebrating the
Fourth of July during the drought. The birthplace of President
Harry S. Truman will replace its traditional fireworks with a laser
light show.
   After Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode announced in May that
his city's four-day Freedom Festival would be cut to only a few
events on one day, a number of businesses and organizations donated
money and other resources to help the city throw a weekend bash
after all.
   The scaled-down festival starts today with the fifth annual July
Fourth Restaurant Festival, where chefs from 21 restaurants will
serve their specialties along the Delaware River.
   In Cape Canaveral, Fla., space agency workers will hold a
special Fourth of July ceremony when they move Discovery to the
launch pad to be readied for the first space shuttle mission since
the Challenger tragedy.
   Dave Hilmers, one of the five astronauts slated to fly the early
September mission, and NASA officials will watch from a
flag-bedecked grandstand as the spaceship is rolled out of an
assembly building at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
   In his Fourth of July message, President Reagan said each
celebration of the holiday stirs ``the pure patriotism of
childhood.''
   ``With each flag, with each parade and picnic and burst of
fireworks, we can't help but recall the first stirrings of our deep
love for America,'' the president said. ``No matter how many
Fourths we Americans have seen, every new one revives in our hearts
the pure patriotism of childhood.''
   In Florida, rain and damp weather caused swarms of mosquitoes to
breed and southwest winds, unusual for this time of year, have
blown them from the Everglades by the millions into populated areas.
   Officials in the Miami area issued a mosquito emergency and
warned weekend revelers to arm themselves with repellent.
   ``In many, many parts of Dade County we're experiencing landing
counts on human beings of 50 per minute,'' said Pat O'Conner, Dade
County's assistant director of public works. ``That is, you walk
out in your back yard and you have 50 mosquitoes on you in one
minute.''

<HEAD>Thousands Of British Homing Pigeons Get Lost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of valuable racing pigeons have failed
to find their way home from France since they flew off June 25 in a
cross-Channel competition.
   Pigeon owners believe the pigeons' internal navigation systems
were thrown off course, possibly by microwave ovens, radar signals,
radio frequencies or a solar flare.
   Mary Hamilton, secretary of the Sheffield and District Homing
Pigeon Federation, called it ``a disaster on a vast scale.''
   More than 5,000 birds were released in Nevers, France, for what
should have been a 14-hour sprint home to northern England, where
pigeon racing is a popular betting sport.
   But by Friday night, only 1,500 had arrived home.
   ``The really appalling thing, from the pigeon fancier's point of
view, is that these are the best birds,'' said ornithologist Chris
Mead. Some of the pigeons are worth more than $54,300.
   The pigeons use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate, and
several theories have emerged to explain how they got lost.
   Derek Towers, secretary and manager of the Up North Combine,
thought a solar flare _ an explosion of gases on the surface of the
sun _ upset the birds.
   ``Electrically charged particles are sent out through space and
when they reach us it disorients the pigeons,'' he said. ``This
happened once before, years ago, when a magnetic pulse went through
the atmosphere.''
   Mrs. Hamilton said the weather, which has been temperate, was
probably not to blame. ``It is very puzzling,'' she said.
   ``Some owners believe it was due to airplanes breaking down the
sound barrier which sent (the pigeons) off course,'' she said.
``Others blame microwave ovens, radar and radio signals.
   ``If aerosols can punch a hole in the atmosphere, these ideas
may not be as silly as they first sound,'' she said.
   Mrs. Hamilton said many of the pigeon owners in Sheffield, which
entered 600 birds in the race, were holding vigils from dawn to
dusk in the hope of spotting their birds.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported Friday that at least one
bird had been found among the street pigeons that congregate in
London's Trafalgar Square.

<HEAD>Former Assistant Navy Secretary Paisley Target Of '83 FBI Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense fraud scandal figure Melvyn R.
Paisley was the subject of an FBI probe while he was assistant Navy
secretary in 1983 that examined allegations of bribery and
electronic eavesdropping, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   However, a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute Paisley following
the probe that covered a time when he was an executive for the
Boeing Company, the newspaper reported in today's editions.
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., dismissed the
report as ``a regurgitation of unfounded allegations that have been
examined many times.''
   According to the Times, Paisley's main accuser was James E.
Durst, who was an executive with Paisley at the Boeing Co. Durst,
who left Boeing in 1977, said he told the FBI that Paisley
presented ``an extraordinary risk to the security of the United
States.''
   The FBI presented its findings on Paisley's activities while at
Boeing to then-U.S. Attorney Elsie Munsell, whose Alexandria, Va.,
office is heading a nationwide investigation into defense
procurement fraud.
   The newspaper, citing an unidentified source familiar with the
investigation, said Ms. Munsell declined to prosecute Paisley in
part because the statute of limitations on the electronic
eavesdropping, which allegedly took place in 1970, had expired.
   She also declined to prosecute, the source said, because Boeing,
on whose behalf Paisley had allegedly paid bribes, had already
pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at least $7
million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help win
airline orders.
   Paisley, who has worked as a consultant since he left his Navy
post last year, is one of the central figures in the ongoing
defense procurement fraud probe. Federal investigators contend that
after leaving the Pentagon, Paisley obtained classified information
about defense contracts and sold it to his clients.
   Ms. Munsell declined to discuss the investigations conducted
during her five-year tenure as U.S. attorney.
   Henry E. Hudson, who succeeded her in 1986, and who is managing
the Pentagon fraud investigation, also declined to comment.
   Barcella, who had worked as a federal prosecutor for 16 years,
minimized the significance of FBI agents presenting their
investigation of Paisley to a U.S. attorney.
   ``That doesn't necessarily indicate the FBI thought there was a
case,'' he said. ``There were thousands of petty things agents came
to me with.''
   Barcella also described Durst as ``a disgruntled former employee
whose record on credibility is pretty thin.''
   In addition to naming Paisley, Durst also implicated James E.
Gaines, Paisley's aide at Boeing, in a three-page letter dated Oct.
10, 1983, that he sent to the FBI.
   Gaines, who also worked for Paisley as a deputy at the Pentagon,
is accused of supplying classified material to Paisley when the
former Navy official left the service to become a defense
consultant, according to sources close to the investigation.

   Defense consultant Melvyn Paisley has gone to
court to get the affidavit secretly filed by federal investigators
to search his office for evidence in the Pentagon bribery probe.
   Paisley's lawyers in their request Friday for U.S. District
Judge John H. Pratt to expedite consideration of their motion said
they needed the affidavit to help advise their client on how to
comply with ``numerous subpoenas'' issued in the case. Those
subpoenas are due on July 19, according to the court papers.
   E. Lawrence Barcella and Robert Plotkin, attorneys representing
Paisley and his wife, Vicki, asked Pratt to convene a July 8
hearing to consider their request to obtain the supporting
affidavit.
   ``Additionally, the massive and pervasive publicity given this
matter already may have irreparably tainted the decision-making
process of the grand jury and seal may prevent further taint,'' the
lawyers said in asking the judge to keep under seal their detailed
request to see the affidavit.
   In a related development, The Los Angeles Times reported in
today's editions that sources have told the newspaper Paisley was
the subject of a 1983 FBI probe that examined allegations of
bribery and electronic eavesdropping.
   The newspaper, citing an unidentified source familiar with the
1983 investigation, said then-U.S. Attorney Elsie Munsell declined
to prosecute Paisley following the probe in part because the
statute of limitations on the electronic eavesdropping, which
allegedly took place in 1970, had expired.
   She also declined to prosecute, the source said, because the
Boeing Company, on whose behalf Paisley had allegedly paid bribes,
had already pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at
least $7 million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help
win airline orders.
   Both Ms. Munsell and Henry E. Hudson, who succeeded her in 1986
and is now managing the Pentagon fraud investigation declined
comment.
   Barcella dismissed the report as ``a regurgitation of unfounded
allegations that have been examined many times.''
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, took steps to ensure that no
additional affidavits or search warrants are disclosed in the
Pentagon bribery probe.
   Most of the affidavits which the FBI is required to submit to
justify a search remain sealed. But two were released Thursday by a
U.S. magistrate in Dallas. They reveal that court-ordered wiretaps
and office bugging devices captured the relay of confidential,
inside information on nine defense contracts worth more than $522
million.
   The magistrate in Dallas released the two affidavits because the
government had asked that they remain sealed for 14 days, until
June 30.
   The government also has opposed a motion by United Technologies
and Eugene Tallia, head of Pratt & Whitney's Washington offices, to
allow them and their legal counsel to view an affidavit that
supported a search warrant for the offices. The facilities were
searched June 14. The search focused on the relationship between
Tallia and two consultants, Paisley and William Galvin.
   The government's request, also filed Friday in U.S. District
Court, said that to disclose any but small portions of the
affidavit would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation.
   The affidavit pertaining to Paisley has been kept under court
seal since federal investigators obtained the warrant to search
Paisley Associates, Inc. in Washington on June 14.
   His lawyers said that unless they have an opportunity to inspect
the affidavit, they ``will be substantially hindered and delayed in
providing effective advice and representation to applicant and in
determining the appropriate response to the subpoenas and to the
propriety of the search warrant.''
   Paisley, a former assistant Navy secretary for research, left
the Pentagon in 1987 to become a consultant to several defense
contractors.
   Paisley's telephone has been tapped and his consulting office
bugged during much of the two-year investigation.
   Federal authorities this week opposed another request to unseal
an unrelated search-warrant affidavit in New York City on the
grounds that evidence sought in the case had been destroyed before
it could be examined by investigators.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said that ``we'll
double-check and make sure we don't encounter similar problems'' in
other courts around the country containing more than 40 sealed
search warrants and affidavits that are part of the investigation.

<HEAD>British TV Company Reportedly Buying MTM</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television South PLC, a British production
company, has agreed to buy MTM Entertainment Inc., an independent
U.S. company co-founded by actress Mary Tyler Moore, in a deal
worth about $325 million, a newspaper reported.
   The British company, known as TVS, said it could neither confirm
nor deny Friday's report in the Financial Times, but said its chief
executive James Gatward would make a statement at a news conference
here on July 6.
   The Financial Times said the deal was struck in London on
Thursday after all-night negotiations, prompting a suspension of
trading in TVS shares on the London Stock Exchange.
   MTM, a private Los Angeles company which takes its name from
Miss Moore's initials, had planned a $100 million initial public
stock offering last year but withdrew those plans after the October
stock market crash.
   At that time, the company was valued at around $450 million and
had after-tax profits of $26.1 million in the 1987 financial year,
down from $30.6 million the previous year, according to the Times.
   Since MTM was founded in 1970, it has produced about 30
television series and more than a dozen made-for-TV movies. Among
its hit TV series have been ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``St.
Elsewhere,'' which have a large audience in Europe.
   In addition, MTM develops and produces theatrical movies and
operates a record and music publishing company, MTM Music Group of
Nashville, Tenn.
   TVS, although relatively small, screens its productions in
southern England, the most prosperous area of Britain. TVS
productions are aired by Independent Television (ITV), Britain's
two-channel national commercial network. The non-commercial British
Broadcasting Corp. runs the other two channels.
   TVS showed a pre-tax profit of 21.8 million pounds, or about $37
million, in the fiscal year ending last October. Revenue totaled
171.9 million pounds,or about $292.2 million.
   The Financial Times said TVS has more than 25 million pounds, or
$40 million, in cash and will finance the deal by issuing stock
underwritten by the British merchant bank County NatWest.
   It said the deal would give TVS production capacity in the
United States, potential access to the U.S. networks ``and a
library of programs to sell across Europe to television stations
and cable and satellite.''

<HEAD>Human Rights Lawyer Killed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with human rights groups suggesting
motive in slayings and possible involvement of authorities, new
subversion charges against Europeans, ADD background on Mendoza, no

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen pulled a motorcycle beside the
car of a human rights lawyer and shot him to death on a downtown
street today.
   Emmanuel Mendoza, 57, was the third human rights lawyer killed
in the Philippines in as many weeks. A human rights group today
suggested that the police or military could be involved in the
unsolved slayings.
   Police Cpl. Porfirio Olais said two unidentified men on a
motorcycle opened fire on Mendoza when he stopped his car at a busy
intersection. A bystander brought the lawyer to a nearby hospital,
where he died minutes later, police and hospital officials said.
   Mendoza's wife, Emilia, said in a radio interview that her
husband had received several death threats from unidentified
callers.
   The independent Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates
said Mendoza's shooting could be related to his work as defense
lawyer for slum residents whose communities have been raided by
police in search of communist hitmen.
   Mendoza was a legal counsel of the left-wing BAYAN organization
and chairman of the Manila Solidarity Alliance, a federation of
Manila slum residents' groups.
   His killing came two days after a failed assassination attempt
on Nemesio Prudente, the left-wing president of the state-run
Polytechnic University of the Philippines.
   Two weeks ago, gunmen also shot and killed human rights lawyer
Ramon Cura in his home near U.S. Clark Air Base north of Manila. A
colleague, Alfonso Surigao, was shot and killed in his residence in
the central Philippine island of Cebu last week.
   ``This series of killings has victimized personalities who have
been associated with the legal left,'' a statement released by the
human rights group said.
   ``That this could go on without the government being able to
solve any single case raises the strong possibilities that certain
segments of the police and the military could be involved in
them,'' the statement added.
   Investigators have yet to publish findings on an earlier ambush
on Prudente in November.
   Human rights groups blamed rightist death squads for that
attack. It occurred a week after soldiers and policemen chanted
``Kill Prudente'' during a funeral for a police captain and three
other people killed by communist assassins in the capital.
   The military and police had accused Prudente, an outspoken human
rights activist, of using his school to shelter communist
guerrillas. Prudente denied the charge.
   Also today, a government-run news agency said military
authorities have filed a new subversion complaint against two
Europeans and a Filipino of German descent accused of aiding
communist rebels.
   Swedish national Stellan Hermansson, West German Protestant
minister Klaus Schmidt, and Filipino businessman Antonio Bosch were
arrested June 8 and later held at a military camp, the Philippine
News Agency said.
   On Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected the petition of the
three men to drop charges of rebellion and kidnapping. It agreed,
however, to place them under the custody of a church group while
awaiting trial.
   In the new charges, the military said the three men were seen
with communist New People's Army guerrillas in four Quezon province
towns from May 23 to 25 and on June 2 this year and instructed new
rebel recruits, the agency said.
   Earlier, the military had accused them of taking part in a Feb.
3 raid in San Francisco town in Quezon and taking hostage two
policemen after the attack.
   Hermansson has said he arrived in the Philippines for the first
time in mid-May, and the other two said they were in the capital on
the day of the Feb. 3 raid.

<HEAD>Report Says Pilot Error Most Likely Caused Helicopters' Collision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED M. NATT JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No action is warranted against anyone
as a result of a collision of two Army helicopters in March, even
though pilot error probably caused the accident that killed 17
soldiers, an Army report says.
   The accident happened March 8 when a UH-60 Black Hawk returning
from a solo instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in
a formation of three returning from a night training mission to
pick up soldiers in the field.
   ``Up to the point of impact, the missions were formed just as
briefed,'' said Maj. Randy Schoel, public-affairs officer at the
Army base.
   The report found that the collision ``was the result of the two
air crews' being unable to see each other in the final moments of
flight,'' according to a statement read by Schoel at a news
conference Friday.
   The approximately 175-page report concluded, ``Pilot error, to
wit, a reasonable mistake in judgment is the most probable
explanation for the cause of this accident.''
   But the report, compiled by an investigation board of six Fort
Campbell officers _ all aviators, said: ``There should be no action
taken against anyone as no foundation for negligence can be
established. The accident was not due to lack of diligence, nor
unreasonable or unprofessional conduct.''
   The investigation board found no evidence of a mechanical
malfunction in the two Black Hawks involved in the crash. ``Nor can
it be confirmed that there were any procedural errors on the part
of either crew,'' Schoel said.
   The report, however, cited other factors, including exterior and
interior design characteristics of the UH-60 Black Hawks and
limited pilot training using night-vision goggles. The report noted
a lack of lighting on the helicopters, and said the number and the
size of position lights on the outside of the $4.6 million Black
Hawk were inadequate.
   The helicopters were made by Sikorsky Aircraft division of
United Technologies Corp., said Staff Sgt. Dan Moore of the public
information office at Fort Campbell.
   In Stratford, Conn., late Friday, Robert Stangrone, a Sikorsky
spokesman, said: ``All aircraft have some degree of field-of-view
limitation. Obviously, the ideal cockpit is a glass bubble with an
unobstructed view. It's a matter of design tradeoffs that consider
structural integrity, ballistic tolerance, survivability and so on.
... Design and operational tradeoffs also determine the extent and
intensity of exterior aircraft lighting.''
   The report said one of the two helicopters may not have had its
anti-collision strobe light turned on as required at the time of
the accident.
   ``That's the only item in question _ the strobe light,'' Schoel
said.
   The lead helicopter, struck broadside, carried 13 soldiers. The
other craft carried four. All 17 victims belonged to the 101st
Airborne Division at Fort Campbell. The other two helicopters
landed safely.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled through Arkansas, west Texas, from Florida
to the middle Mississippi Valley, through New England and western
Washington today while skies over much of the nation were clear.
   A half dozen thunderstorms stirred up severe weather in the
South on Friday night. In Arkansas, thunderstorms whipped high
winds that downed power lines in Little Rock and blew a
tractor-trailer off the interstate highway east of Mayflower. A
thunderstorm in Alabama produced high winds that downed trees and
power lines around Mobile.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the lower Missouri Valley through western, lower Tennessee
Valley and central Gulf Coast into central and southern Florida;
scattered showers across northern and central New England and
through the northern Pacific coast; and mostly sunny skies over the
rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s across much of the
nation; in the 60s across the northern two-thirds of New England
and over northwest Washington; in the 90s from the northern Rockies
through the central and southern inter-mountain regions, across
central and eastern Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley and
across the southern half of Florida; between 100 and 105 across the
Rio Grande Valleys of Texas; between 100 and 110 degrees from the
valleys of California into the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Marquette, Mich., Sault Ste Marie, Mich., and Traverse
City, Mich., to 89 degrees at Las Vegas, Nev.

<HEAD>Hay Arrives For Indiana Farmers; Alabama Governor Seeks Disaster
Designation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Salty Water, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hay from Southern farmers hoping to repay a debt from their own
1986 dry spell arrived in drought-stricken Indiana, while Alabama's
governor asked federal officials to declare his state a disaster
area due to crop damage.
   Also Friday, an economist estimated the drought could cause $3
billion in damage to North Dakota's economy this year.
   At Cloverdale, Ind., farmer Ed Meek accepted 180 bales of hay
donated by South Carolina farmers and trucked in Friday by
volunteer off-duty Charleston, S.C., police.
   ``Our hay yield is down and what we're using now is what should
be used next winter,'' he said.
   In 1986, Indiana and 40 other states sent about 800,000 bales of
hay to South Carolina when the Southeast was suffering a severe dry
spell.
   At Charlotte Court House, Va., which was spared by the drought,
farmers gathered a shipment of hay Friday to send to Ohio.
   ``Two years ago, I helped load a lot of hay in Ohio that went
South,'' said Ohio's director of agriculture, Steve Maurer,
thanking the Charlotte County farmers. ``Kind of in passing, I said
`Someday we might need a little help ourselves,' and little did I
know it was just two years away.''
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste issued an executive order Friday that
he said would speed delivery of hay to drought-stricken farmers and
ban most outdoor burning, and he urged mandatory water use
restrictions statewide.
   Also Friday, Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt asked federal officials to
declare Alabama a disaster area, citing ``widespread damage to
corn, cotton, peanuts, soybeans, grain sorghum, hay and pasture
crops.''
   In a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, Hunt
said it was estimated that 30 percent to 50 percent of the state's
crops were damaged by the drought.
   In Washington, Lyng said the federal government likely will
support financial aid to farmers once losses are more fully known.
   After briefing President Reagan on the findings of an
interagency task force on the drought, the secretary told reporters
that long-range weather forecasts are discouraging.
   Meanwhile, administration officials disclosed that Reagan will
fly to Davenport, Iowa, July 14 to view drought damage.
   Despite up to 2 inches of rain this week, Iowa had its driest
half-year on record, said Harry Hillaker, acting state
climatologist.
   In the Tennessee River Valley, last month turned out to be the
driest June since records began in 1890, said Carl Vines of the
Tennessee Valley Authority.
   Of the TVA's 220 rain monitoring stations, 39 recorded nothing
during June _also a record.
   For today, showers and thunderstorms were predicted from the
lower Missouri Valley through the western parts of the lower
Tennessee Valley and central Gulf Coast into central and southern
Florida.
   The drought has cost North Dakota farmers $530 million in small
grain losses this year, while livestock producers suffered $225
million in losses caused by the drought, said Arlen Leholm, North
Dakota State University agricultural economist.
   North Dakota farmers also stand to lose as much as $473 million
in federal deficiency payments, the result of soaring crop prices,
and must recover some of that if the state is to get through the
drought, Leholm said.
   Leholm estimated North Dakota's total financial loss as $2.4
billion to $3 billion, including the impact of lost farm income
that would have ``turned over'' several times in the state.
   Michigan's crops have suffered as much as $600 million in damage
and that figure will climb higher unless rain soon soothes parched
fields, the state's agriculture director said.

<HEAD>North Korea Says South Attacked Its Border Guards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea today accused South Korean troops of
attacking one of its border guardposts with machine-gun fire.
   The attack occurred south of Changpoong in the western end of
the Demilitarized Zone on Friday, Pyongyang's official Korean
Central News Agency said.
   It said the attack endangered the safety of North Korean
personnel, but it did not report if the communist nation's forces
fired back or if there were casualties.
   The agency said the attack constituted a grave military
provocation premeditated by South Korean authorities to increase
tension and cause military conflict. It said South Korea was
seeking an excuse to suppress anti-U.S. and anti-fascist domestic
movements.
   There was no immediate comment from South Korea.
   The two countries maintain more than 1 million heavily armed
troops facing each other along the 150-mile demarcation line which
runs across the waist of the Korean peninsula. It was established
under the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War.

   The U.S. defense industry is feeling the first
shock waves of the military procurement investigation, as Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci announced suspension of payments on $1
billion worth of contracts.
   Carlucci's surprise action was based on information in
search-warrant affidavits unsealed by a federal magistrate in
Dallas on Thursday.
   Carlucci, who earlier had urged caution in reacting to the
investigation, declared at a news conference that ``wherever we
have specific evidence we will take action.''
   Pentagon officials said that the impact of the suspension on the
companies and their workers would depend on each of the scores of
contracts involved, and possibly on the financial health of the
company.
   Carlucci also announced that the Pentagon was beginning
suspension procedures against three individuals and a company named
in the documents, and he said the Defense Department was reviewing
existing contracts with four implicated companies and freezing new
contracts on nine weapons systems.
   ``The Navy has initiated suspension procedures with respect to
George Stone, Mark Saunders, Joe Bradley and the Continental
Electronics division of Varian Associates Inc.'' Varian Associates
was the 155th largest defense contractor for 1986 and its parent
company Varian Continental received more than $81.76 million in
defense awards in that year, according to the unsealed affadavit.
   He said the current actions did not gravely impair national
security.
   George Simpson, a spokesman for Varian Associates, said the
suspension will affect only one of Continental Electronics'
military projects, developing low frequency transmitters.
   Simpson says he doesn't know the value of the contract, but it
represents ``only a very small part'' of Continental Electronics'
business ``so there would be no immediate impact on the firm.''
   He said the company was ``surprised and disappointed'' by the
suspension because it had been told it was not a target of the
investigation. ``Allegations, alone, are not the basis for such
action,'' he said.
   The New York Times reported today that among the companies whose
payments have been interrupted are the Canadian Marconi Co., Litton
Industries, Bell Atlantic Corp., TRW Inc. and Lockheed Corp.
   Carlucci said the Pentagon was reviewing existing contracts with
four companies named in the Dallas affidavits _ Litton, Norden
Systems Inc., Hazeltine and Emhart.
   Norden, based in Norwalk, Conn., is a division of United
Technologies Corp., the eighth largest defense contractor in 1987
with deals totalling $3.3 billion. Litton was the 14th biggest,
with contracts worth $2 billion. United Technologies is based in
Hartford, Conn. Litton has offices in Van Nuys, Calif.
   ``We do not know what the allegations are, if any, or the
government's basis for stopping payments,'' said Litton spokesman
John Thom.
   Emhart spokesman Dan Barrett, said the Farmington, Conn.-based
company will ``comply fully and expeditiously because we're
confident nothing improper will be found.''
   ``Hazeltine continues to cooperate fully with authorities in the
investigation,'' said a statement issued on behalf of the Long
Island, N.Y.-based company.
   The largest single weapons system on which payments are being
frozen is called the Anti-Submarine Operating Center, a $712
million system of shore-based command and control centers to
coordinate efforts to locate and destroy submarines.
   Saunders, one of the three individuals named by Carlucci, is a
former Navy procurement officer convicted of and fired for stock
trading on insider Navy information in 1982. The FBI said Saunders
was receiving inside contract data from Stone, his Navy successor,
and it ``believes that Saunders is paying Stone for this
information.''
   Stone is one of six Pentagon officials transferred to other
duties after their offices were searched.
   The third individual named by Carlucci, Bradley, has been placed
on administrative leave from his job as vice president for
marketing of Varian Continental, of Palo Alto, Calif., according to
a company spokesman.
   Meanwhile Friday, Norden announced it had withdrawn from
competition on a contract to build a high-tech portable shelter
used near a battlefield to control aircraft in all kinds of weather.
   The company cited the need for the public and government to
``have full confidence in the integrity of the ... procurement
process.''
   The other seven weapons systems on which new contract actions
were suspended are:
   _The Digital Communications Terminal, a $150 million program to
develop a hand-held computerized unit to compose messages for
transmission by field radios.
   _The Tactical Environmental Support System, a $58 million Navy
program.
   _A $51 million fiber optical project.
   _The Digital Wideband Radio set, being developed at a cost of
$49 million.
   _A $38 million anti-submarine warfare electronics display unit.
   _The $30 million Bancroft radio for tanks and Marine Corps light
armored vehicles.
   _A $6.3 million project to develop very low frequency and low
frequency communications gear.

<HEAD>Soviet Team Arrives To Begin Inspections Of Missile Factories</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto SC1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy Soviet missile
specialists arrived here to begin an unprecedented inspection of
U.S. weapons factories as their American counterparts traveled to
Moscow to check Soviet sites.
   The landing of the Soviets' flight here Friday marked the first
day that 26 missile sites in the United States and Western Europe
and 126 Soviet sites became subject to superpower inspection. The
inspections are provided by the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
treaty signed Dec. 9 at the Washington summit.
   ``The treaty creates a relatively new atmosphere of trust
between our two nations,'' Vyacheslav S. Lebedev, spokesman for the
Soviet technicians, said in a brief statement to reporters. ``Our
common task is to guarantee mutual trust.''
   Under the treaty, the two countries each must destroy a pre-set
number of their medium-range missiles.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, two U.S. inspection teams,
consisting of 10 experts each, met with reporters before boarding
an Air Force jet for Moscow.
   ``We all feel this is a historic mission,'' said the head of the
inspection agency, Army Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie.
   One U.S. team was bound for the Soviet city of Votkinsk, the
site of a plant that formerly built the SS-20 missiles, the most
important Soviet weapon to be eliminated under the treaty.
   The United States has the right to keep a team at Votkinsk for
up to 13 years, and the Soviets may station inspectors for the same
period at Magna, Utah, site of Hercules Plant No. 1, where U.S.
missiles were produced.
   Inspection teams will verify the destruction of 1,800 missiles
and check on about 3,200 related components, including storage and
transport missile containers and special hauling vehicles, Lajoie
said.
   The Soviets' silver-and-white Aeroflot IL-62, sporting the
Soviet flag on its tail, was an odd site on the tarmac here next to
a B-52 bomber and a C-5 Galaxy cargo craft, parked for a July 4
show at the air base 50 miles northwest of San Francisco.
   After a 17-hour flight from Moscow, the all-male inspection
team, dressed in civilian suits as required by the treaty, looked
bemused as reporters clamored over each other for a glimpse and to
hear their statement.
   Col. Tom Smalls, team chief for the Department of Defense's new
On-Site Inspection Agency, said the Soviets would announce later
which missile sites they will inspect besides the one at Magna,
Utah. Twenty-two inspectors are headed there.
   The destinations of the remaining 48 Soviets are not required to
be made public immediately by the Soviets, said Lt. Col Joseph
Wagovich of the On-Site Inspection Agency.
   The treaty allows the two sides to visit the other country on 16
hours' notice and then permits them to wait 48 hours after their
arrival before giving notification of the exact sites they will
visit.
   From Travis, Wagovich said, the Soviets could travel to as many
as five additional sites, located in San Diego; Fort Huachuca and
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona; Dugway, Utah; and Pueblo,
Colo.
   The Soviets have yet to announce when they will send inspectors
to visit several sites in the Eastern states.
   Wagovich said Travis' 60th Military Airlift Wing will have nine
hours after the Soviets announce their intended destinations to fly
them to those sites.
   The Soviet air crew members likely will remain at Travis during
the ``baseline inspections,'' which under the treaty can last a
maximum 24 hours unless both superpowers agree to extend them
another eight hours, he said.
   The baseline inspections are designed to verify the exact number
of missiles and related components to be destroyed under the treaty
within the next three years.
   Reporters will not to be allowed to accompany the teams.
   The Soviet technicians will be escorted by U.S. missile
technicians and specialists in linguistics and security.

   Stock prices fell for the second day on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange today after prices fell on Wall Street and the
dollar posted strong gains against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
265.87 points Friday, fell another 141.01 points, or 0.5 percent,
to end today's half-day session at 27,362.52.
   Traders said the loss was due mainly to the appreciation of the
dollar, which ended the week's trading in Tokyo Friday at 134.50
yen, its highest level this year, and because of concerns over
possible higher interest rates.
   ``The strength of the dollar and profit-taking were behind the
market's fall yesterday (Friday), and the market is still
adjusting,'' said Michio Katsumata, a spokesman for Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   A trader who spoke on condition of anonymity said worry over
higher interest rates led to losses for some large-capital issues,
while the lower yen pushed some export-oriented issues higher.
   Among the gainers were Hitachi, Fujitsu, NEC, TDK, Pioneer and
Sony.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 900
million shares. On Friday, 2.6 billion shares were traded.
   On Wall Street Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost
10.13 points as traders took to the sidelines for the Fourth of
July holiday.
   The Tokyo foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

<HEAD>Report: Fundamentalists Plotted Disturbances At Mecca</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of an pro-Iranian underground
fundamentalist group arrested in Egypt were planning to go to Saudi
Arabia to create disturbances during the annual Moslem pilgrimage,
a newspaper reported.
   Bahrain's Arabic-language newspaper Akhbar Al-Khaleej on Friday
quoted Egyptian investigators as saying that Iranian intelligence
officers had recruited the group as well as others in Britain,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Afghanistan. It said the groups
were expected to work together.
   Twenty members of the Egyptian-based group were to smuggle arms
and explosives to Saudi Arabia, organize demonstrations and
distribute hostile leaflets calling for ``internationalization of
the two holy shrines,'' the Cairo-datelined report said.
   It quoted the investigators as saying that members of the group
confessed to links with Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guards,
the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah party, and the underground Iraqi
party called Al-Daawa.
   The shrines at Mecca and Medina are Islam's holiest, and the
Saudi ruling family is considered their custodian. Moslem pilgrims
from all over the world converge annually on the kingdom for the
pilgrimage, called the hajj, which falls this year in the latter
part of July.
   Demonstrations the Iranian pilgrims last year sparked clashes
with Saudi police that left 402 people dead, 275 of them Iranians.
The Saudi authorities said they died in a stampede, while the
Iranians claim Saudi police shot them.
   Saudi Arabia has limited pilgrims from each country to 1 per
1,000 people in any country, setting an expected Iranian quota of
45,000. Iran has said that if it cannot send its usual 150,000
pilgrims, it will boycott the event but that other groups will
demonstrate against the Saudi government.

   A funeral home that extended credit to a
Detroit woman may have had to wait a bit longer than it expected
for payment _ 57 years.
   A letter with a Nov. 17, 1930, postmark surfaced recently,
delivering a note of thanks and a check for $100 to the Truesdale
Funeral Home.
   The letter had a 2-cent stamp and was addressed to funeral home
founder George P. Truesdale. It was delivered to H. Sam Ansell Jr.,
who now owns the mortuary.
   The letter probably encounterd a fate common to long-delayed
mail, said David Mastervich, an account representative at the post
office in nearby Kalamazoo.
   ``We probably moved some equipment that's been there 50 years
and they found a letter under it,'' he said. ``At least no one can
say it didn't get delivered.''
   The woman's note thanked Truesdale for extending credit for the
funeral of her mother.
   ``You have been most kind in letting us have this time to pay
and we sincerely thank you,'' she said.

   Robert and Lana Wessel can say their newborn
daughter is truly one in a million: She shares the birthday of her
two older sisters.
   Audrey was born Thursday at Memorial Hospital and Health Care
Center. Natalie, 4, and Ashton, 2, also were born on June 30.
   ``I thought I would either have her the day before or the day
after,'' said Mrs. Wessel. ``And that morning was a big surprise
when I went into labor.''
   Audrey was due June 15, and her two sisters also were about two
weeks late, Mrs. Wessel added.
   ``I didn't think it would happen the second time, much less the
third time,'' she said. ``I told my girls they were getting a baby
sister for their birthday and that was fine.''
   Next June 30, the family will have three cakes, three parties
and sing ``Happy Birthday'' three times, Mrs. Wessel said.
   The odds of having three same-sex children born on the same date
are about one in one million, said computer scientist Douglas
Miller at Naval Avionics in Indianapolis.

   Teams of gunmen shot and killed two men
in Punjab state, including an official in Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's party, police and newspaper reports said today. Both
attacks were blamed on Sikh militants.
   Police identified the slain party representative as Manjit Singh
Verka, a district general secretary of the governing Congress Party.
   He was killed in his home about three miles south of Amritsar by
six men who burst in and shot him today while he drank his morning
tea, said district police chief Suresh Arora.
   At Sotal village about 25 miles northwest of Punjab's state
capital of Chandigarh, five Sikhs shot and killed Gurdev Singh,
reported the United News of India. It gave no details.
   More than 1,400 people have been killed in Punjab so far this
year by Sikh militants agitating for a separate homeland.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's population of 800
million, but they are a majority in Punjab. They claim they are
discriminated against by the country's Hindu majority.

   Law enforcers say luck was with them
when they made what is believed to be the nation's largest drug
seizure outside Florida, a 6,000-pound shipment of pure cocaine
hidden inside blocks of chocolate.
   ``It was a cold hit,'' said Peter Baish, the agent in charge of
the U.S. Customs Service office in New Jersey, whose inspectors,
working on a hunch, found the drugs.
   Authorities announced the seizure Friday, which they said has a
retail value of about $480 million. The raid is likely to drive up
the price of cocaine in the New York area this summer, they said.
   Three Colombian nationals, believed to be members of a major
Colombian drug cartel, were arrested when 50 agents raided the
Toronto Imports warehouse, said Robert Stutman, agent in charge of
the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York.
   U.S. Customs inspectors stumbled upon the cocaine during a
routine check aboard the ship Allison Lykes at a port in Newark,
N.J., on June 24, Baish said.
   Agents paid special attention to the shipment, 1,200 cartons
marked ``unsweetened Ecuadorean coca chocolate,'' because Ecuador
is a source of cocaine, he said.
   They drilled into one of the cardboard boxes and hit a metal box
hidden in the core of the hardened chocolate, said Baish.
   Agents opened up the carton and found the cocaine inside the
metal box, he said. They resealed the box and kept a surveillance
on the shipment with the help of electronic monitoring devices.
   The contraband was picked up Thursday by a trucking company
hired by the smugglers. A team of narcotics agents then followed
the trucks to the Hicksville warehouse, said Art Stiffel of U.S.
Customs in New York.
   The investigation determined that the drivers were not part of
the drug scheme, Stiffel said.
   Stutman declined to say whether Toronto Imports was connected to
the scheme. He said more arrests were expected.
   Each carton weighed about 66 pounds. Each package of cocaine
within weighed about six pounds and was marked with the initials of
the person who had ordered it, said Stiffel. Stutman said at least
779 of the 1,200 cartons contained cocaine.
   A few hours after unloading the truck, the suspects began moving
out four or five of the cartons and placing them into cars.
   At this point the agents moved in and arrested the unarmed
defendants: Oscar Nunez, 28, of New Yorks' Queens Borough; Absalon
Borrero, 42, of Miami; and Jaime Caro, 48, of Anz, Colombia.
   All three were charged with importation and distribution of
cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. They were ordered
held without bail at their arraignment before U.S. Magistrate A.
Simon Chrein in Brooklyn Borough.
   Stutman said the suspects were believed to be members of the
Ochoa family of Medellin, Colombia, one of three leaders in cocaine
trafficking.
   Officials believe the cocaine was produced in Colombia and
shipped to Ecuador, where it was concealed in the cocoa powder
bricks.
   ``This is the largest seizure in the U.S. outside of Florida,''
said Stutman.
   The largest haul of cocaine on record was made in May, when
authorities seized 8,800 pounds in Tarpon Springs, Fla.

<HEAD>Gulf Salt Water Threatens New Orleans River Water</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Corrects saltwater to salt water thruout, except where

<TEXT>
   A wedge of salt water creeping up the
Mississippi River could begin tainting New Orleans' water supply in
a week despite federal efforts to build a dike to slow the
intrusion, a university professor says.
   The salt water from the Gulf of Mexico, flowing upstream because
the worst drought in decades has weakened the Mississippi's flow,
is traveling about two miles per day and was within 17 miles of New
Orleans on Friday.
   When the salt water first reaches the city, on about July 10,
the contamination will be minimal, but by July 20 the salinity of
the city's water could hit 200 parts per million, said Louisiana
State University professor emeritus Raphael Kazmann.
   That would make the water drinkable but ``make the coffee taste
lousy,'' he said.
   In addition, the salt water could corrode appliances such as
water heaters and dishwashers, he said.
   By the end of the month, the salinity probably will reach 300
ppm, which is above federal drinking water standards although it
can be tolerated by most healthy people, he said.
   By the end of June the salt water had traveled as far upriver as
it had on Oct. 8, 1965, a severe drought year, Kazmann said.
   The river is usually at its lowest point in the fall, and that
doesn't bode well for Louisiana in 1988, he warned.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction Thursday on
a $947,000 sand and clay barrier that will stretch 1,200 feet along
the contours of the river bottom about 63 miles from where the
river meets the Gulf of Mexico.
   Construction is expected to take less than a month, spokesman
Bruce Sossaman said Friday.
   Salt water hugs the river bottom because it is heavier than
fresh water. It is advancing up the river because the
drought-induced low flow is not rapid enough to push it back to the
Gulf.
   The upper point of the saltwater wedge is about 15 miles past
the dike the Corps is building, Sossaman said.
   ``The levee is not as good an idea as it was before,'' said
Frederic Chatry, chief of the Corps' Engineering Division. ``But
we're not trying to solve the saltwater intrusion problem. We're
just trying to mitigate the part of saltwater intrusion caused
because we deepened Southwest Pass 5 feet ... last fall and
winter.''
   Southwest Pass is a primary navigation channel for entering the
river from the Gulf of Mexico.
   To compensate for the salt water's movement and to make up for
lost time, the Corps might build the sand and clay sill slightly
higher than originally planned, Chatry said.
   Residents of New Orleans and the several other communities who
get their drinking water from the Mississippi River shouldn't
panic, Sossaman said.
   At first, the salt water will not perceptibly change the taste
of the city's water supply, he said. If the salinity increases, it
should only pose problems for those under salt-restrictive diets.
   So far, abnormal salinity has not registered at the city's water
intakes, said Sewerage and Water Board spokesman Joe Puglia. The
board is working with the state and the Corps but has no citywide
plan, he said.
   Saltwater intrusion in the Mississippi River is not uncommon,
Sossaman noted. Communities close to the Gulf of Mexico experience
the problem every summer with varying degrees of severity.
   ``Because of the drought, this summer it will probably go up
higher and stay longer,'' he said, adding it could go as far as 75
miles upstream to Baton Rouge, La.
   Autumn rains should help force the salt water back to the Gulf,
he said.

<TEXT>
   New appraisals of a proposed prison site for which
Gov. Michael Dukakis' administration has asked $10 million to buy
from developers put the value of the land at under $6 million,
according to sources.
   The state wants to build a 500-bed prison on the hilltop land in
New Braintree. Developers, who one critic of the project alleges
are friends of the Democratic presidential candidate, sought $9.5
million for the land two years ago.
   The FBI is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations
that the Dukakis administration leaked word to the developers of
state interest in the land. They bought it from a church for $3
million.
   Dukakis, who the FBI says is not under investigation himself,
and the developers deny the allegation or any association with each
other.
   Dukakis, asked about the controversy in recent weeks, has
reiterated his position that the state will ``not pay one dime
more'' than the fair market value of the property.
   Three sources, all speaking on the condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press on Friday that two appraisals listed the value
of the hilltop land in the $5 million to $6 million range. The
sources would not provide exact figures on the appraisals but one
said they were ``not far apart.''
   The appraisals are being reviewed by a third company, which is
scheduled to submit its estimate of the property's worth next week.
All three will be used by the state to determine how much to offer
for the 782 acres bought by two developers in December 1985.
   Selection of the New Braintree site in 1986 by Dukakis for a
medium security prison has been controversial from the outset, with
local residents claiming a prison would ruin the tiny central
Massachusetts community.
   The land _ which houses a defunct church academy, 20 homes and
more than 700 acres of farmland _ is owned by developers Danial
Striar and Dr. Gary Jacobson.
   If they reject the state's offer for the land, the state can
take it by eminent domain, a move that likely would end up in
court. The developers could not be reached Friday for comment.
   The chief critic of the prison project, Dorothea Thomas-Vitrac
of New Braintree, has made the allegation that the men are close
associates of Dukakis and were tipped off about the state's plans.
   In denying the allegations, Striar and Dukakis have said they
met once, at a 1986 ground-breaking ceremony. Jacobson grew up in
the same neighborhood as Dukakis and has donated to his campaigns.
Dukakis has said he knows of Jacobson from childhood but has no
personal or business dealings with him.
   In April 1986, nearly two years after the administration began
eyeing New Braintree for a prison but a month before Dukakis
officially announced the siting, a Springfield company hired by the
state put the value of the land at $8.7 million.
   The appraiser, the R.J. Greely Co., told the state in a report
that its review ``is not to be considered a complete appraisal. Due
to time constraints and other limiting conditions, we are doing
this report in `broad brush' terms, without having time to do our
own research.''
   As part of a larger prison funding package, Dukakis in May 1986
requested $22 million for New Braintree, $10 million of which was
to be set aside to purchase the land. Striar and Jacobson offered
it to the state for $9.5 million.
   Critics of the prison, led by Thomas-Vitrac, complained that
Striar and Jacobson stood to make more than $6 million on the deal
without improving the site.
   Dukakis and other administration officials said they sought the
$10 million appropriation to avoid waiting another year to have the
money included in the next state budget.

   Iraqi warplanes fired missiles into two
tankers leaving an Iranian oil terminal and set them on fire,
Persian Gulf shipping executives said today.
   The attacks on the 268,081-ton Greek-owned Fortuneship L and the
284,299-ton Iranian-owned Khark 4 raised fears of a new round of
shipping raids by Iran and Iraq in the so-called ``tanker war.''
   Both ships were still blazing 12 hours after the attacks.
Shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
had no word of casualties in the latest raids.
   The tankers were at the end of a convoy that had loaded at the
Kharg Island terminal in the northern gulf and was sailing south
for Larak, another terminal in the Strait of Hormuz, the entrance
to the gulf.
   The last Iraqi strike on Iranian shipping was June 8 when
warplanes attacked the 742-ton Singapore-flagged tugboat Salverve.
Two seamen were killed.
   Iran's last raid was June 14, when gunboats attacked the
Singapore-flagged Neptune Subaru, setting it on fire.
   The main focus of the nearly 8-year-old gulf war in recent
months has been on the battlefield. The Iraqis have recaptured a
series of border areas to gain an edge in the conflict with Iran.
   Baghdad Radio, quoting a military communique, reported that
Iraqi warplanes hit two ``large maritime targets,'' which usually
means tankers, off the Iranian coast at 10 p.m. Friday (3 p.m. EDT)
and at 8 minutes after midnight (5:08 p.m. EDT Friday).
   The jets scored ``direct and effective hits'' and returned
safely to base, the communique said.
   ``The raids were in line with Iraq's determination to cut off
the enemy's oil supplies and revenues which it uses to finance the
war,'' the communique added.
   The Iraqis have been attacking tankers carrying Iranian oil
since 1984 seeking to choke off Tehran's economic lifeline.
   The Iranians retaliate on a ship-for-ship basis. Iraq's ports
have been closed since the early days of the war, so the Iranians
attack neutral merchant ships, mainly those serving Kuwait or Saudi
Arabia. Tehran claims they aid Iraq.
   More than 500 ships have been attacked in the tanker war and
more than 300 seamen have been killed.
   The Iranians gunboats have kept a low profile in recent weeks,
with only three attacks reported since May 27.
   But shipping executives said today that an Iranian gunboat was
active in the southern part of the waterway, raising fears that it
was prowling for targets following Iraq's night-time air strikes.
   In Seoul, South Korea protested to Iraq an attack on an Iranian
construction site and demanded compensation for the deaths of
Korean workers.
   The Iraqi air force Thursday bombed a gas plant being built at
Kangan on Iran's southern gulf coast and the Cyrus oilfield in the
northern gulf.
   The South Korean government said 12 Korean workers were killed,
along with one Iranian, in the Kangan raid. Seoul said another 45
Koreans were wounded.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Iraq's Higher Education Ministry said
in Baghdad that thousands of male students have been sent to
special camps for a month of military training
   The spokesman, who declined to be identified, said the students
were drafted from Iraq's five universities and dozens of schools.
   The summer camps apparently were set up to boost Iraq's military
reserves. An estimated 1 million Iraqis are currently under arms.
   Under compulsory military service, Iraqi men serve in the
regular army for 24 months after graduation.

   The Communist Party fell in line behind Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and decreed sweeping political reforms to establish a
stronger legislature and president and limit elected party
officials to 10 years in office.
   The changes point the way to a new ``democratic image of
socialism,'' the Soviet leader declared late Friday as he closed
the four-day conference of 5,000 party members in the Kremlin.
   The party also will review the qualifications of each of its 20
million members this year, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
said today.
   Such a review could be used to clean out the conservative
opposition that Gorbachev says is still holding back his reforms.
   Pravda said the conference considered it necessary ``to carry
out this year a report-election campaign in party organizations,
governed by the decisions of the conference about reform of the
political system, democratization of party life.''
   The conference, the party's first since Josef V. Stalin
assembled the 18th gathering in 1941, was urged to dismantle a
system of power and privilege for party bureaucrats that has
dominated Soviet society since the dictator's time.
   Gorbachev told the party's policy-making Central Committee and
other organs urgently to settle questions of political reform so
the plans the conference approved can be implemented beginning with
a fall session of the Supreme Soviet parliament.
   He said the first elections under the reforms could be held in
April 1989.
   The official Tass news agency said the plan approved by the
conference also calls for a reorganization of the party apparatus
before the end of the year, but gave no details.
   Alexander Lukyanov, secretary of the party's Central Committee,
told a late-night news conference that the gathering backed
Gorbachev's proposals to limit elected party officials to a maximum
of two five-year terms with no exceptions.
   He also said the new, stronger presidency backed by the party
meeting gives the president powers Gorbachev requested to settle
matters of foreign policy and chair the Defense Council. The latter
position traditionally is held by the party general secretary, the
post now held by Gorbachev.
   It also approved his controversial recommendation that Communist
Party leaders become the leader of the corresponding legislature,
all the way up to combining the job of president and party general
secretary. That could set the stage for Gorbachev to further
consolidate his grip on power by taking on the duties of the more
powerful presidency.
   Candidate Politburo member Georgy Razumovsky said 209 delegates
voted against that provision, an extremely rare show of dissent in
the party.
   The presidency is now a largely ceremonial post held by Andrei
A. Gromyko. On Friday, Gromyko, 78, was honored with the
chairmanship of a session of the conference.
   On Thursday, Vladimir I. Melnikov, party boss in the Russian
republic's region of Komi, told the conference that Gromyko and
other high officials who served under Leonid I. Brezhnev should be
removed for contributing to the country's stagnation.
   Gorbachev on Friday referred to his proposals to create a new
2,250-member Chamber of People's Deputies, a smaller and more
active Supreme Soviet, and the new presidency: ``The conference
will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the
society, but now we know how we must transform the political
system.''
   The Soviet leader presided over what the Tass news agency called
an ``unusually stormy and long'' debate over the resolutions,
further reflecting the extraordinary spirit of open criticism
permitted during the session.
   Gorbachev, assessing the results of the conference just before
it closed, said, ``Through democratization, economic reform and
changes in the political system we will make perestroika
irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state of our
society, a new humane and democratic image of socialism.''
   He also proposed building a monument in Moscow to Stalin's
victims. ``I think we must agree to this,'' Gorbachev said. ``This
would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire
Soviet people.''
   Stalin has come under increasingly sharp criticism under
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness. But the
decision to build a memorial to the millions of people executed or
imprisoned during Stalin's rule is the most definitive step Soviet
authorities have yet taken to repudiate him.

   The National Assembly today voted down
President Roh Tae-woo's nomination for chief justice in the first
test of power in the new legislature.
   The rejection of Chung Ki-sung was the first time in South
Korea's 40-year constitutional history that a president's
nomination of a chief justice has been turned down by the National
Assembly.
   It also was the first serious political setback for Roh since he
took office on Feb. 25 with a narrow victory in December's
presidential elections. Roh's government lost its majority in the
legislature during elections in April.
   In another vote, the Assembly approved by a narrow margin Roh's
nomination of former lawyer Kim Young-jun as head of the
government's Board of Audit and Inspection, a Cabinet-level post.
   The one-house Assembly rejected Roh's nomination of Chung as
chief justice by a narrow margin. Roh backers mustered 141 votes,
seven votes short of a simple majority required for approval. There
were 295 lawmakers present in the 299-member Assembly.
   Six lawmakers voted against Chung while 134 others, mostly from
the nation's two major opposition parties headed by Kim Dae-jung
and Kim Young-sam, abstained from voting in a coordinated
anti-government gesture. There were 14 invalid votes.
   Roh's governing Democratic Justice party, which controls 125
sets, had been confident that it could muster enough votes with the
help of a conservative opposition group.
   Kim Jong-pil's New Democratic Republican Party, with 35
lawmakers, had publicly endorsed Roh's nomination, but some of its
members rebelled and voted against Chung.
   The nation's two major opposition groupings, the Party for Peace
and Democracy and the Reunification Democracy Party, questioned
Chung's background under past authoritarian governments.
   Chung, 60, was named a Supreme Court judge in 1986 after holding
various judicial posts for 29 years.
   The governing party lost its parliamentary majority in the April
26 elections for the first time since South Korea was established
in 1948.
   Also today, 101 Assembly members introduced a resolution urging
North Korea to take part in this year's Olympic Games in Seoul and
said it could build momentum for national unification.
   The resolution, sponsored by lawmakers from the governing and
opposition parties, is to voted on next week.
   The North, which has demanded to be made a co-host of the
Olympics, has said it will boycott the Olympics unless its request
is met. The International Olympic Committee and South Korea have
refused, but have offered to let it stage several events.

<HEAD>Robertson To Campaign For Bush, Sees Dole as Vice Presidential
Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Pat Robertson, a
speaker at today's state Republican convention, said he plans to
campaign for Vice President George Bush in states where Robertson
had a stronger showing.
   Robertson also said he thinks the best vice presidential running
mate for Bush is Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan.
   Robertson said in a telephone interview Friday that Bush asked
him for help in bringing Robertson supporters into the GOP fold.
Robertson easily carried the state's March 8 precinct caucuses and
controls about 70 percent of the delegates at the Washington state
GOP convention.
   ``The vice president wants me to be active in states where he
didn't do as well as I did,'' Robertson said. ``That would include
Washington, Nevada, Minnesota and Iowa. And I'll be going into the
South as a surrogate to bring the rather substantial movement that
was supporting me to the elections for the vice president.''
   Robertson predicted a close election and said his followers
could make the difference in a GOP victory.
   Robertson said Dole's presence on the ticket would help.
   ``I don't presume to tell George Bush what to do but I think the
strongest candidate we have for vice president is Bob Dole,''
Robertson said. ``He brings strength in the Midwest and Mountain
states to go along with Bush's strength in the East and the South.
   ``Plus, Dole's legislative experience along with George Bush's
foreign policy experience would make a nice balance and make for a
very strong ticket,'' he said.
   Dole, who spoke to the convention banquet Friday evening, said
he would be willing to discuss the vice presidency.
   ``I'm not campaigning for it. I'm not seeking it,'' Dole said,
but added if Bush called him, ``I'd say very honestly I'd be happy
to discuss it.''
   The Robertson-dominated convention is expected to adopt an
ultra-conservative platform, including support for South Africa's
position on apartheid.
   The platform reads like a compendium of conservative thought. It
is against gay rights, a state income tax, abortion, the United
Nations, and school health clinics, and for the deployment
Strategic Defense Initiative of space-based weapons, Contra aid
``everywhere,'' prayer in the schools and more nuclear development.
   The state convention is poised to send the nation's largest
Robertson delegation, apparently 38 delegates, to the national GOP
convention in New Orleans next month.

   Plans for peace in Cambodia are piling
up as Vietnam withdraws its troops from the country and opposition
groups prepare to meet for informal talks this month.
   The intensified search for a political settlement appears to
have been sparked by fears from several sides that the Khmer Rouge
could return to power. The communist Khmer Rouge defeated a
U.S.-backed government in 1975 and, according to some estimates,
killed 3 million Cambodians before they were toppled by the
Vietnamese invasion of 1978.
   Special U.N. envoy Rafeeuddin Ahmed has returned from Cambodia
after presenting a peace plan, the details of which have not been
disclosed. And the foreign ministers of the Association of
Southeast Nations reportedly will unveil another plan when they
meet in Bangkok next week.
   China proposed Friday that all Cambodian factions form a
coalition government before a total Vietnamese pullout. The Beijing
plan, which includes a call for all Cambodian parties to freeze
their force levels, is an apparent effort to keep the Khmer Rouge
from becoming dominant.
   Western analysts say China, the main weapons supplier to the
Khmer Rouge, is a key to the success of any negotiated settlement.
   The anti-Vietnamese resistance, a coalition of three groups led
by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, on June 25 issued proposals stressing
international supervision of a Cambodian agreement.
   The plan is directly tied to the informal talks scheduled for
July 25 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Vietnam and the Sihanouk coalition,
which includes the Khmer Rouge, have already accepted invitations
to the talks.
   The coalition includes the Khmer Rouge and the non-communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   he official Cambodian news agency SPK said Friday that Prime
Minister Hun Sen received an invitation but did not say whether the
government would attend.
   The resistance has proposed that Vietnam withdraw its forces in
three stages under international supervision. It also said the
coalition and the Phnom Penh government should be dissolved and a
four-party coalition government set up and headed by Sihanouk. The
coalition would then hold free elections.
   Vietnam has promised a total withdrawal of its forces from
Cambodia by 1990 and has begun a partial pullout of 50,000 troops
and withdrawn top military command. Vietnam said the conduct of the
anti-guerrilla war now will be directed by the Cambodians.
   According to local newspapers, the Southeast Asian foreign
ministers will consider a plan worked out by senior officials of
their bloc. It includes a general ceasefire; the pullout of all
Hanoi forces in three phases; the end of all foreign military
support for combatants and an international peacekeeping force that
would remain in Cambodia for five years.
   A Phnom Penh broadcast made available today indicated some
problems with the proposal brought to Cambodia by the U.N. envoy.
   Hun Sen was quoted by the official broadcast as describing the
meeting as an ``initial'' one and urged the United Nations to
``continue seeking to understand all the points upon which all the
Cambodian parties agree or do not agree with each other.''
   Hun Sen ``stressed that all solutions to the Cambodian problem
must absolutely guarantee'' the Khmer Rouge does not return to
power, the radio said.

   Israeli troops shot and killed an Arab youth in
a demonstration today in the occupied West Bank ton of Jenin,
Israeli radio said. Protests broke out in at least four other West
Bank towns.
   Arab assailants also hurled a firebomb today at troops in Gaza
City but no injuries were reported, the army said.
   An army spokeswoman denied soldiers opened fire in Jenin, where
the death was reported, or in the West Bank town of Kalandia, where
a youth was said to have suffered a bullet wound.
   ``We have had a report from the hospital that a man died and the
army is checking if there is a connection,'' the military
spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The army did not
see a body; the army used gas and rubber bullets only.''
   Israeli radio said the Jenin youth was shot in the head and his
body was taken from the hospital by his family. It said the clash
with soldiers erupted after masked men entered schools and brought
schoolchildren out to demonstrate.
   A hospital official in Jenin confirmed the death, and an Arab
reporter identified the dead boy as 17-year-old Na'el Youssef
Muhamad Hamaisi. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A man in his 20s was treated and released for a bullet wound in
the thigh after a demonstration in Kalandia, officials at
Jerusalem's Mokassed Hospital said.
   The military spokeswoman said the army clamped a curfew on Jenin
and on the West Bank refugee camp of Jelazoun and town of Kalkilya,
where there also were brief protests.
   In Gaza City, an unidentified attacker hurled a firebomb at an
army vehicle, the army spokeswoman said. She said the bomb damaged
the car, but no one was injured.
   Since the anti-occupation unrest began in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip on Dec. 8, 215 Palestinians have been killed. Four Israelis
also have died.
   On Friday, the Israeli general in charge of the Gaza Strip
promised to release dozens of Arab prisoners from areas where
rioting has ceased and called on aspiring Palestinian leaders to
cooperate with Israeli authorities.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai used Israel's Arabic television
services to appeal to Gaza's 650,000 residents in what appeared to
be an attempt to reward residents for the relative calm of recent
weeks.
   Also Friday, former U.N. Ambassador Benyamin Netanyahu said
Israel should deport hundreds of Arabs who instigate riots and have
a policy of opening fire at people who throw rocks and firebombs.
   Israeli analyst Ron Ben-Yishai, military correspondent for the
Yedioth Ahronot Hebrew newspaper, said anti-Israeli attacks are now
being carried out by small numbers of highly trained Palestinians.
This is in contrast to the early months of the uprising, when
hundreds of residents took part in frequent mass protests.
   Mordechai's statements indicated Israeli authorities are ready
to use a carrot as well as a stick approach, now that the massive
violent demonstrations that characterized the first months of the
uprising have waned.
   ``I have intentions to release dozens of prisoners, including
administrative detainees, next week, and they will mostly be
released if they are from places where there is quiet and security
and where there has been a return to routine life,'' Mordechai said.
   Last month Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, who is in charge of the West
Bank, released 89 Palestinian prisoners, a step military officials
said was taken ``to contribute to restoring normal life to the
area.''

   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda today
annointed six U.S.-made F-16 jet fighters as Buddhist monks
sprinkled holy water on the aircraft that Thailand purchased from
the United States.
   Thailand is acquiring a total of 18 F-16s for $475 million in an
effort to bolster its defense capabilities against Vietnamese
forces in neighboring Cambodia. Thailand also bought two U.S.-made
Gates Learjets, at a cost of $10.7 million, to be used as
reconnaissance aircraft.
   During the ceremony at Don Muang military airport, six F-5E
fighter-bombers flew overhead while a Buddhist monks chanted and
sprinkled holy water on the F-16s. Prime minister Prem placed
garlands around the nose of each aircraft.
   At the ceremony, Prem thanked the United States government for
selling the jets to Thailand. In Asia, the only two other countries
to which the United States has offered its advanced fighters are
South Korea and Singapore.
   Attending the ceremony were U.S. Ambassador William Brown and
about 100 senior military and police officers.
   American pilots last month flew the F-16s from the General
Dynamics plant in Fort Worth, Texas, where they were manufactured,
to an air base in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima.

   A man was arrested Saturday after what
authorities described as a low-speed chase through Pennsylvania,
Maryland and West Virginia.
   Jackie Leroy Thayer, 34, was pursued through three states on
suspicion of being involved in a hit-and-run accident in
Pennsylvania and finally was caught here after being trapped on a
dead-end street, said Sgt. K.M. Ambrose of the West Virginia state
police.
   Thayer, who is from Martinsburg, refused to stop and chase ran
several cars off the road, Ambrose said. Despite the pursuit,
speeds never were excessive, the sergeant said.
   ``To me, a high-speed chase is in excess of 100 miles per
hour,'' Ambrose said, adding that in this case, the driver simply
refused to stop.
   Thayer was charged with speeding in a 35 mph zone, third-offense
driving while intoxicated, driving with suspended license,
resisting arrest, having no proof of insurance, reckless driving,
driving left of center, failure to yield to an emergency vehicle,
and improper registration, Ambrose said.
   The sergeant said he expected Maryland and Pennsylvania
authorities to file charges later.

   No ifs, ands or butts _ a man convicted
of stealing a load of cigarettes will have to kick the habit or
spend time behind bars.
   State Judge Boyd P. Mossman believes an addiction to cigarettes
caused Elroy T. Rin to steal $427 worth of them from a barge last
year at Kaunakakai Harbor on Molokai Island.
   Rin, 20, pleaded no contest to fourth-degree theft in connection
with the cigarette heist, and also to second-degree theft involving
$110 worth of stolen beer.
   At a sentencing hearing Friday, Mossman told Rin to avoid
alcohol and drug use and suspended a 90-day jail term on condition
that Rin quit smoking.
   Mossman also put Rin on five years probation, ordered him to
perform 300 hours of community service and told him to get a job.

   A civilian airplane participating in

pilot. The other F-16 crashed into the Black Forest after the pilot
parachuted to safety.
   West German police in Ploen said the light Bronco OV-10 plane
went down just outside the town about 60 miles north of the port
city of Hamburg. The aircraft was being used for spotting during
army artillery exercises.
   Police were still investigating the cause of the crash.
   The plane belonged to an aviation company in Luebeck, and its
pilot was West German.
   In Bordeaux, France, a West German air force Transall transport
plane made a crash landing today near the Bordeaux-Meringac
airport, injuring all six men aboard, officials said.
   The Transall was arriving in Bordeaux to pick up West German
soldiers who had been involved in military exercises in the region,
French military officials said.
   The reason for the crash landing was not immediately known.

   The bell from a British ship that sank
in stormy seas nearly 33 years ago has resurfaced in the nets of an
Icelandic trawler.
   The bronze bell, inscribed H.M.T. Grayling, belonged to the
Grayling, a British transport vessel commissioned by the navy in
1942 during World War II.
   The ship, which was sold after the war and renamed Barry Castle,
sank while fishing off Iceland's west coast in November 1955. Five
of the 19 crew members died.
   The crew of the trawler Pall Helgi said last week that they
pulled in the bell June 22. It was caught near the shipwreck, which
lies in water 360 feet deep.

   Six more people drowned in floods
recently in Bangladesh, bringing the death toll in this year's
rainy season to 71, officials said Saturday.
   The latest deaths occurred Thursday and Friday. The victims _
three children and three adults _ drowned in flood waters in
Mymensingh district, 55 miles north of Dhaka, relief officials told
The Associated Press by telephone.
   At least 400,000 people have been affected in Mymensingh, most
of them farmers whose crops and homes have been submerged in floods
that ravage Bangladesh annually.
   An estimated 10 million people have been stranded, displaced or
otherwise affected by monsoon floods in Bangladesh this year.
   That's nearly 10 percent of the population of 105 million.
   Last year, about 1,200 people died in floods from the annual
monsoon rains, which last from April through July.

   A taxi driver died of
a heart attack after a brawl with five British men who sprayed his
passengers with beer, police in this resort town said Saturday.
   A police spokesman said officers jailed five British men aged 18
to 21 after the fight early Friday on a discotheque-lined street of
Calvia, a popular coastal resort on this Spanish Mediterranean
island.
   The office of the paramilitary Civil Guard in Palma, the
capital, said the men would be arraigned on charges of public
violence causing injuries.
   Taxi driver Antonio Vega Moreno, 46, of Calvia, who suffered
from a heart condition, died of a heart attack en route to
Sondureta Hospital in Palma after the fight, said the police
spokesman. He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with
custom.
   The fight began just before 2 a.m. Friday when the man sprayed
the driver's passengers with beer as the car pulled away from a
taxi stop, the spokesman said.
   When Vega Moreno protested the action, the Britons began beating
him and one struck him with a bottle, the spokesman quoted
witnesses as saying.
   They traded punches with several taxi drivers who came to help
Vega Morena, and at least one of the drivers suffered facial cuts
and bruises, the spokesman said. Municipal police and paramilitary
Civil Guard officers broke up the brawl.

<HEAD>Defense Consultants Talk About Making Living The Honest Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Alexander Flax left the Pentagon in 1969
after six years as the Air Force's research and development chief,
he asked the military's top lawyer what consulting work he could
properly do on the outside and what he could not.
   ``I had a test when I was in the Pentagon which was `I'm never
going to do anything here I don't want to see in writing on the
front page tomorrow,''' Flax says. ``That's a pretty good test.''
   Flax is a defense consultant, a member of a large and
diversified profession that's become as indispensable to the
marriage of government and industry as programs and spending. His
line of work is technical consulting, which he says, is far removed
from the world of bribery and corruption that's currently in the
headlines.
   Others who are closer to that world are reluctant to talk about
it on the record. ``You can make a good living very honestly in
this business,'' one said. ``That's why I don't understand these
people.''
   The FBI's view of some of ``these people'' was revealed in
affidavits filed in court on June 14 to support FBI searches of the
offices of consultants, contractors and a few Pentagon offices:
   ``The evidence developed in the investigation has shown that
consultants often are the ones who:
   ``1. obtain information and documents from government officials
which should not be released to the companies and provide those
items to the companies.
   ``2. speak to the government officials about doing something to
benefit particular companies and
   ``3. provide government officials with bribes and gratuities.''
   One type of consultant gives advice to companies on government
relations, looking at their strategic plan for the next half dozen
years and seeing whether that plan matches what the government
needs.
   They advise on simple things.
   ``One time a company wanted to do a briefing for congressmen
interested in a particular weapon,'' one consultant said. ``They
wanted to have lunch, arranged in a downtown hotel miles from
Capitol Hill. I told them a congressman isn't going down to 14th
Street, he doesn't have time. If you are going to do a
presentation, it's got to be within a few blocks of the Capitol.''
   For such advice, he said, a consultant might earn $1,000 a day
whenever he works. But he can be called on for far more difficult
tasks.
   ``I've got a client who specializes in selling things overseas.
He had a question as to policies in a particular area of NATO,
about how countries procure different things,'' said one
consultant, who asked not to be named. ``I found a man in the
Pentagon who is responsible for setting policy in that area and
asked if I could bring that manufacturer in and let him clarify. In
that case, it was a liaison function.''
   In some cases, consultant is just another name for lobbyist. The
military producer depends on contacts with the Pentagon and with
Congress. The consultant gives strategic advice about whom to
approach and how and when to make that approach.
   ``I never tell my client that I can get a congressman to take a
stand to support their position one way or another,'' the
consultant said. ``I say I can get you to present your side of the
case.''
   And, he added, ``I would never dream of going in to a
congressman saying `Support this as a favor to me.' I say, `There
are two sides to every story. There is a problem here between
services. This is one possible solution. Let me give you this
side.' And I always tell him what my client's interest is.''
   Flax, an aeronautical engineer with a distinguished record,
said, ``No one ever told me, `Look, I have just been hired by
company X to get them this contract.' It's never stated that way.''
   Most former Pentagon hands who become consultants on the outside
start with knowledge of who buys weapons for the government and
what general programs are under way. They can keep up with changes
just by reading newspapers and trade magazines.
   ``One little on-line squib that says Joe Doaks has just been
replaced by John Brown in that office is very meaningful to him,''
Flax said. ``He knows where Brown came from, knows what his
character is, knows what the duties of the office are.''
   ``You may have noticed, '' he added, ``that the consulting
business is not limited to people who have left the Defense
Department. People who have been in AID (the Agency for
International Development) know a lot about foreign countries and
how to do business with them. Didn't Henry Kissinger form a
consulting firm and charge phenomenal fees?''
   When he left the Pentagon, Flax said, ``there was an absolute
prohibition for one year on going back to the department I worked
in with the Air Force and having to do with any matter that
involved contracts because I had held a position where I had some
influence on virtually all contracts let in research and
development.''
   There was a lifetime ban, he said, on joining forces with anyone
with whom he had negotiated because some contracts stretch over
many years. As an example, Flax cited the Maverick missile, which
still is in the Air Force arsenal.
   Now, 20 years later, he said, conflict-of-interest laws are much
more restrictive.
   ``You have to be your own watchdog,'' Flax said. ``I'm very
careful about what I do. I'm no longer constrained. I've been out
of government for a long, long time. Still, I watch my actions.''

<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz has
appealed for talks with Romania following heightened tensions
between the two Warsaw Pact allies, a government newspaper reported
today.
   In an interview with the newspaper Magyar Hirlap, Grosz was
quoted as stressing the ``political necessity and moral
obligation'' for direct talks with Romania to find an end to the
dispute.
   The newspaper said Grosz, who also is premier, wants to go to
Romania for talks but did not know when.
   Grosz was quoted as saying there have been no contacts between
he and Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu but considered it
important that Ceausescu had called for a meeting between
representatives of the two nations to improve relations.
   On Friday, the Hungarian Parliament passed a resolution accusing
Romania of violating the human rights of ethnic Hungarians and
other minorities in the neighboring East-bloc country.
   The action was taken at the end of a week of escalating tensions
over Romania's planned demolition of 7,000 villages with the
residents to be resettled in ``agro-industrial'' centers.
   Budapest newspapers said some Hungarians were being prevented
from entering Romania.
   The resolution adopted by Parliament with only one abstention
said Romania is violating ``the fundamental human, national and
nationalities-related rights.''
   It called on Romania to re-examine its resettlement plan.
   There are about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians living in Romania
and about 220,000 ethnic Germans as well as thousands of Serbs.
Most of the Hungarians live in Transylvania, many in villages to be
destroyed.
   Romania claims the resettlement will provide higher living
standards and gain productive agricultural land where houses now
stand.
   ``The annihilation of the values of the settlements doomed to
destruction ... would mean an irreparable loss not only to the
Hungarian, German and other ethnic minorities, but also to the
Romanian people themselves,'' the resolution said.
   Earlier this week Romania expelled several Hungarian diplomats
from an area inhabited by many ethnic Hungarians, closed a
Hungarian consulate in Cluj and began turning back Hungarian
tourists.
   Matyas Szueroes, the head of the foreign relations committee who
presented the resolution to Parliament, said Hungary's leadership
would ``always be cooperating partners'' and was prepared to go
ahead with preparations for a meeting of the two countries'
premiers.
   Hungarian newspapers quoted officials and travelers as saying
Hungarians wishing to enter Romania were being turned back at the
border.
   In some cases only those traveling through Romania to other
destinations were allowed to cross into the country, the papers
said.
   Romania's decision to close the Hungarian consulate in Cluj in
Traynsylvania followed a demonstration by some 50,000 people who
marched past the Romanian Embassy in Budapest to protest the
resettlement plan.

<HEAD>RENAMO Reports Capturing Two Army Barracks, Ambushing Convoy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebels said Saturday they
captured two army barracks and ambushed a military convoy, killing
38 Mozambican and five Zimbabwean soldiers.
   The Mozambique National Resistance, known by the Portuguese
acronym RENAMO, said its fighters seized the barracks in southern
Maputo and central Sofala provinces.
   The rebels said they ambushed a convoy of 37 vehicles outside
the capital, Maputo, and killed 10 Mozambican soldiers and captured
206 Soviet-made weapons.
   The statement, distributed in Lisbon, said the fighting took
place from Monday to Thursday.
   RENAMO also claimed 3,700 Zimbabwean soldiers had recently
entered Mozambique and were deployed in the northern-central
provinces of Nampula, Zambezia and Tete. The statement alleged that
Mozambique government forces were ``losing control of the military
situation.''
   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims nor
any indication of RENAMO casualties in the reported attacks. The
rebels have been waging a hit-and-run guerrilla campaign since 1977
to topple the Marxist government.
   Troops from neighboring Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Malawi fight in
Mozambique alongside the army, mainly to protect vital transport
routes and an oil pipeline from rebel attack.
   The rebel statement said the alleged Zimbabwean reinforcments
brought the total number of Zimbabwean soldiers in Mozambique to
8,700. It claimed 32,300 foreign soldiers were stationed in
Mozambique.

<HEAD>Court Documents Reveal FBI Agents Not Fired For Breaking Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents who broke drug and customs laws
were reprimanded and suspended but not fired, according to court
documents in a lawsuit filed by an agent who was dismissed.
   The previously confidential documents were obtained by an
attorney for former agent Anthony P. Rezza, who was fired three
years ago after using federal money and a car in a gambling spree
in Atlantic City, N.J.
   The 22-year veteran filed suit last year contending that the
action against him was overly harsh.
   Court files on the suit contain six disciplinary cases. In
addition, government lawyers have conceded, without supplying
files, the details of four other cases mentioned in Rezza's
complaint.
   Allegations include reports of an agent who was suspended for 30
days after being arrested when he entered the country with
marijuana and drug paraphernalia.
   There is also a report of a supervisor who was demoted,
suspended for 45 days and put on probation for a year for placing
bets with a bookie while supervising a gambling investigation of
the same bookie.
   FBI officials declined to comment on the documents. Spokesman
William Carter said the bureau does not comment on pending
litigation. He added that disciplinary cases ``are confidential, an
employer-employee administrative matter.''
   In court documents, government lawyers have contended that
Rezza's dismissal _ regardless of his compulsive gambling problem
or the FBI's record of discipline with other agents _ was an
acceptable option.
   In a motion filed June 14, Alice W. Ballard, Rezza's attorney,
said, ``The bureau's past practice is inconsistent with the
categorical rule it now asserts.
   ``The FBI disciplinary files produced in this case are replete
with examples of agents who remained in service ... despite the use
of drugs, misuse of credit cards, customs violations, illegal
gambling, drunken driving, sexual misconduct, a hit and run
accident and other illegal behavior.''
   Ballard would not discuss the case, tentatively scheduled for
trial in November.
   Some lawyers believe disparities in discipline are the result of
an internal struggle between moderate elements in the FBI and
conservative followers of the late J. Edgar Hoover.
   ``There is this gap between those elite elements who believe in
a concept of government service and those elite elements who have
more military mentality,'' said Antonio V. Silva, one of the
lawyers in a class-action discrimination suit filed last year by
agent Bernardo Perez and now joined by 300 Hispanic FBI agents.

<HEAD>Staunch Conservative Dominates Supreme Court, With Some Surprises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, as if to
declare himself the man in charge, emerged as the Supreme Court's
dominant force in its just-completed 1987-88 term.
   But to do so, the staunch conservative cast some surprising
votes. They included trimming presidential power through an
independent counsel law, making the CIA more accountable in its
employment practices and, in a key free-speech dispute, ruling for
sex magazine publisher Larry Flynt over evangelist Jerry Falwell.
   Rehnquist led the court in each case. He also wrote for the
court when it upheld a municipal rent-control law and when it
strengthened the right of prison inmates to see documents used in
their prosecution.
   A year ago, Rehnquist completed his first term as chief justice
with the knowledge that his leadership had been blunted by the
court's leading liberal, William J. Brennan.
   In the most significant cases, Rehnquist often had been among
the dissenters as Brennan led the court's majority.
   That trend was reversed, and Rehnquist cast fewer dissenting
votes during the 1987-88 term than any court member except Justice
Byron R. White, a member of the court's floating center.
   But is Rehnquist, long the court's leading champion of the
political right, moderating his views?
   ``He was carrying the flag (for conservatives) for a long time,
and now he's chief,'' said Patrick McGuigan of the conservative
Free Congress Foundation. ``Part of his job now is to count up five
votes (needed for a majority) and to anticipate outcomes.''
   Michael Greve of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation
added, ``He may feel an obligation to be statesmanlike.''
   Both men said Justice Antonin Scalia now reigns as the court's
most conservative member.
   There is no doubt, however, that Rehnquist remains a core
conservative. For example, he wrote for a 5-4 majority when the
court ruled that a law providing federal money to religious groups
to discourage teen-agers from premartial sex does not necessarily
violate the separation of church and state.
   From the first Monday in October when Justice Lewis F. Powell
retired to Feb. 18, the court was one justice short. Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, President Reagan's third choice to fill the
vacancy, arrived only after the thwarted appointment of Robert H.
Bork and the aborted nomination of Douglas H. Ginsburg.
   Kennedy participated in 62 of the court's 139 signed decisions
in a term that saw the court, with some notable exceptions,
continue its conservative course.
   Kennedy's voting pattern already has liberal groups grumbling.
In the future, his vote may give the court a solid conservative
majority with those of Rehnquist, Scalia, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor and, in most instances, White.
   Brennan's most loyal ally remained Justice Thurgood Marshall,
but Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens joined Brennan
far more often than they did Rehnquist or Scalia.
   Here are summaries of the major rulings by the nation's highest
court during its 1987-88 term:

   _Public school officials have sweeping authority to censor

   _Communities have the power to ban pickets from demonstrating in

   _States may not ban lawyers from advertising by mailing

   _Evidence discovered by police during an unlawful, warrantless
search may be used at trial if ``rediscovered'' during a lawful and
wholly independent second search.
   _Targets of grand jury investigations may be forced to authorize
foreign banks to release information about any accounts they may
have in those banks.
   _Police do not need a court warrant before searching through

<TEXT>
   A government official warned Saturday of a
crisis if the influx of Vietnamese boat people to Hong Kong does
not stop. His statement came after 468 of the refugees arrived in
one day.
   ``The situation in 10 days, if it goes on like this, will be
critical,'' John Fortune, chief staff officer of the government
Civil Aid Services, told Hong Kong television.
   Vietnamese refugees have continued to flood this British colony,
despite a tough new policy designed to keep them out.
   The government considers boat people arriving after June 15 to
be illegal immigrants who will be kept in camps until Vietnam
agrees to take them back. Only those fleeing religious or political
persecution will be granted refugee status.
   Hong Kong previously considered all boat people arriving from
communist Vietnam to be refugees eligible for resettlement in other
countries.
   Fortune expressed concern that facilities to house the growing
number of boat people could fill up before new camps are opened.
   ``I would like to emphasize that we've got to get across to
these people that they are going straight into detention,'' Fortune
said.
   ``It's absolutely ridiculous to keep on coming here. They
arrive, they go into detention and they will be eventually all sent
back to Vietnam,'' he added.
   The new policy was drafted as the number of boat people soared,
to about 7,800 this year through mid-June, or about 12 times the
number who arrived during the same period last year.
   During the first half of June alone, 2,850 Vietnamese boat
people sailed into Hong Kong waters. Arrivals during the second
half of the month were just under 1,200, according to government
statistics.
   On Friday, 468 boat people arrived. Another 172 sailed into the
colony Saturday, according to the government.
   It was not immediately clear whether the most recent arrivals
left Vietnam before the new policy was announced.
   Lord Glenarthur, British minister of state in charge of Hong
Kong affairs, told a news conference Friday that it was an
``appalling indictment'' of the Vietnam government that its people
were willing to stay in crowded camps in Hong Kong rather than live
in Vietnam.
   The government says the overwhelming majority of boat people are
so-called ``economic migrants'' fleeing Vietnam in search of a
better life.
   Immigration officers Wednesday began screening new arrivals to
determine who was eligible for refugee status.

   A 12-year-old boy playing in a park
dropped his realistic squirt gun and raised his arms when
confronted by police who had received a call about a commando armed
with a machine gun.
   A witness called police about noon Friday and reported seeing a
man dressed in military fatigues carrying a gun in Wickham Park,
police Lt. John Mott said.
   Eight police cars from Manchester and East Hartford surrounded
the park preparing to search for the gunman when Mott spotted the
boy, who was wearing camouflage clothing, a backpack, a military
belt and a helmet.
   ``As I got out of the car, he dropped the gun and put up his
hands up,'' Mott said. ``That was the smart thing for him to do.''
   ``When he saw the other cops pull up, he looked a little
bewildered, a little nervous,'' Mott said.
   Mott, who had not drawn his own handgun, said he realized the
boy's gun _ resembling an Uzi submachine gun _ was a toy as soon as
he saw it.
   After the commotion was over, Mott said they ``let the kid go
play.''
   The General Assembly last session approved legislation
restricting the sale of realistic toy guns that have been blamed in
several accidental deaths elsewhere in the country.

   The drought withering farm crops may be
nourishing religious faith in rural communities in Indiana, where
parched lands threaten farm families' spirits as well as their
livelihood.
   While praying for rain, members of small town congregations are
being challenged to look deeper into their faith, some religious
leaders say.
   Although a selection of churches around Indiana reported no
significant increase in Sunday attendance, special services to pray
for rain have drawn well.
   ``People make more of an attempt for a deeper prayer life
because of this, because it's a challenge,'' says the Rev. John
Boeglin of St. Celestine Roman Catholic Church in Dubois County in
southern Indiana.
   ``I don't think this is bringing people back to the church,''
said Boeglin, who is in charge of rural church affairs for 12
counties in the Evansville Diocese. ``Most people on the land are
already regular churchgoers because they know they're dependent on
God for their success in agriculture. They have to have a bountiful
rain that they can't control.''
   One effort to exert influence has been the prayer services to
plead for rain.
   A recent service in Tipton, a town between Kokomo and
Indianapolis in Tipton County, drew about 200 people to a town park.
   ``We don't even get that many people for our Good Friday service
or our Thanksgiving service,'' said the Rev. Jayna Powell, the
minister for youth and family education at West Street Christian
Church. ``People are seeing a need to express their concern about
the drought to God.''
   A recent issue of a diocesan newspaper carried an article by
Boeglin entitled, ``Should We Pray For Rain?''
   ``I jokingly wrote in the article maybe God needs a hearing aid,
or we're not praying loud enough,'' he said.
   The priest answered his own question by organizing a prayer
meeting for Wednesday.
   ``We're not trying to wheel and deal with God. We can't say,
'OK, if we pray for rain, it's going to rain,' '' he said.
   In the past, such prayers were a formal part of the church
calendar, he said. During Rogation days, the three days before
Ascension Day, congregations used to pray for good weather and
bountiful crops.
   ``Now I see there is something in that tradition that we should
keep going, because we see the serious need,'' he said.
   The drought highlights the Christian teaching that hope survives
even in misery and suffering, he said.
   ``I think people need to hear the story God has not abandoned us
because of the drought,'' he said. ``We will make it through. We
will.''

<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab uprising that has torn the
Israeli-occupied territories for seven months is now interfering
with one of the most sacred rites for Palestinian Moslems _ the
hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca.
   This month, as the world's Moslems travel to Islam's holiest
shrine in Saudi Arabia, only about 1,300 Palestinians from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip will make the pilgrimage, less
than a quarter the number who went last year.
   Palestinians say the sharp drop is due to the economic and
psychological impact of the uprising and to tactics the Israelis
are using to try to quell it.
   Adel Abu Sneineh, owner of an Islamic book store, said he
decided not to go to Mecca for fear of what might happen while he
was gone.
   ``I wouldn't even be thinking about the hajj,'' he said. ``I'd
be worried about whether my village was under curfew.''
   Families with sons in jail were also reluctant to leave. Israeli
officials say 5,000 Palestinians are imprisoned in connection with
the uprising. More than 200 Palestinians and four Israelis have
been killed in the violence.
   Palestinians are also faced with deep cuts in income this year
as a result of dozens of anti-Israeli protest strikes, which have
shortened their business hours, and orders from Arab leaders not to
go to jobs in Israel.
   The cheapest route to Mecca costs $740. This covers a bus ride
from the Jordanian capital of Amman to Saudia Arabia and includes
hotels, but not food and other travel costs. It's an extra $30 if
the bus is air conditioned.
   A travel agent specializing in hajj trips, who gave his name
only as Abed, said some pilgrims were also having trouble getting
Israeli exit permits because of unpaid taxes and age restrictions
on Arab travelers.
   Withholding taxes is a chief weapon used by Palestinian
underground leaders in their campaign of civil disobedience against
Israel. One way Israel catches tax evaders is by checking records
of any Palestinian who applies to go to Jordan.
   Under the age restrictions, Palestinian men aged 16 to 35 who go
to Jordan are ordered to stay there for nine months before
returning. The measure was adopted several months ago to try to
prevent messages from being passed to and from members of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Abed Al-Rahman, 30, owner of a small cafe in Arab east
Jerusalem, said this is preventing him and many others from making
the monthlong hajj. ``I just want to make the pilgrimage. I don't
want to hang around Amman almost a year,'' he said.
   Olivier Rafowicz, spokesman for Israel's West Bank military
government, said the age and tax measures were aimed at calming the
violent uprising, not at holding back Moslems wishing to go to
Mecca.
   ``The point is that everyone who wants to cross the bridge (to
Jordan) has to be checked about his tax payments,'' Rafowicz said.
``If there is no problem, he can cross the bridge.''
   It is one of the basic tenets of Islamism that all Moslems go to
Mecca at least once, if they can afford it.
   This year, 1,300 Moslems will make the pilgrimage from the West
Bank and Gaza, according to Ahmed Bayoud, head of the hajj
department of the Jerusalem Wakf, or Moslem welfare society. He
said 5,800 Moslems made the trip last year.
   By the Moslem lunar calendar, this year's hajj is expected to
begin July 14. Buses begin the long trip to Saudia Arabia this
month. The high point of the pilgrimage, marking Abraham's
sacrifice of his son, should fall on about July 22.
   Samir Mohammed Shuweiki, 31, a picture framer, feels so strongly
about making this year's hajj that he paid for the trip even though
he is kept from going by the government's age restrictions.
   He said has been going daily to the Israeli Interior Ministry,
but has not been granted an exit visa.
   ``This is harassment. Before the intefadeh (uprising), I could
have gotten the permit in one day,'' he said.
   Shuweiki, a father of five, spoke in his small shop in
Eizariyya, an east Jerusalem suburb. On the walls were framed
verses from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   He said he would keep up his daily visits to the Interior
Ministry until the last moment.
   ``Why are the Israelis making these obstacles?'' Shuweiki asked.
``I want to go for prayer, not for politics.''

   The last surviving school set up to
dodge federal demands for racial integration in Plaquemines Parish,
has closed, officials said.
   School Principal Monica Wertz said enrollment at River Oaks
Academy was about 300, down from 600 two years ago, and the staff
of 35 was given walking papers Thursday.
   ``It's kind of traumatic,'' she said. ``I guess we're all going
to go out and look for jobs.''
   The school was built along with four others as an alternative to
public education at the height of the civil rights movement in
1966. The schools were the brainchild of Judge Leander Perez,
legendary political strongman of Plaquemines Parish, which covers
the delta of the Mississippi River.
   Enraged by federal court orders to desegregate public schools,
Perez had the private academies built and closed to blacks.
   Parish Councilman Benny Rousselle said the academies nearly
killed the public school system. White teachers and students
abandoned the public schools, which were stripped of supplies and
left to blacks and a handful of others.
   ``The (public) schools were a skeleton,'' said Rousselle.
   Rousselle said he graduated in 1967 with only four classmates
from Belle Chasse High, which is now overcrowded. The parish has
expressed interest in buying the River Oaks property to ease the
overcrowding.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush: Looking for Votes In All The `Wrong' Places?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In recent days, Michael Dukakis campaigned in
Mississipi and Indiana, states that have backed a Democratic
presidential hopeful only once in 28 years. This week, Republican
George Bush is going to Dukakis' hometown for a Greek Orthodox
church dinner.
   No, these presidential candidates aren't just wasting their
time, looking for votes in all the wrong places.
   These events are early feints in the general election campaign,
a strategy called attacking your opponent's base. It is one piece
of putting together the Electoral College puzzle to win 270
electoral votes and the White House on Nov. 8.
   ``If Bush is tied down in places like Indiana and the South,
he's going to have a hard time doing what he needs to win the
election,'' said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman.
   ``It's a smart strategy for both sides,'' said Vince Breglio, a
Republican campaign tactician. ``It's not defending your solid core
vote. It's the marginal voters who are part of your base. They are
part of the core, but not a dependable part.''
   Of course, Bush and Dukakis are looking for every possible vote
in the fall.
   The theory behind the ``attacking the base'' strategy is
straightforward: If a candidate must spend his time making certain
the people who usually vote for his party will back him, he won't
have time to win the swing voters who have been increasingly
crucial to victory in this country.
   For example, Dukakis has campaigned across the South and the
farm belt in the Midwest, regions that have been very strong for
the Republicans. Thus, if Bush must defend his base of support in
those areas, he will have less time to campaign in California, New
York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where the GOP needs to do well.
   While such a strategy is used in all kinds of races, it is
particularly important in a presidential campaign because of the
Electoral College system.
   Winning the most votes doesn't mean winning the White House. A
candidate must win enough states to gain a majority of the 538
electoral votes at stake to succeed Ronald Reagan in 1989.
   Of course, Bush, Dukakis and their aides proclaim that they will
battle for every state in the fall, taking nothing for granted and
conceding nothing.
   ``It's not designed to make Dukakis pay attention to his base,''
said Bush spokesman Mark Goodin of the Thursday trip to Boston.
``It's an indication that we are not going to take anything for
granted.''
   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said the Massachusetts governor's
strength and campaigning all across the country makes it tough for
Bush and the GOP.
   ``In their grand plan, they thought they didn't have to secure
landing rights in big regions of the country,'' Dach said. ``Now,
they're finding they have to lease apartments everywhere.''
   The reality is that there are limited resources for a
presidential campaign and limited time for a candidate's
campaigning.
   ``Once things have started to solidify, I'm sure the Dukakis
campaign will sit down and make a careful assessment of where to
concentrate the resources,'' Mellman said.
   The starting point of any Electoral College strategy _ and the
``attacking the base'' tactic _ is history. And history is on the
side of Bush and the Republicans.
   One way to look at electoral history is the percentage of the
two-party vote for each candidate from 1952 through 1984. Mellman
points out that Democrats have averaged a majority of the vote in
only six states and the District of Columbia over that period.
That's a total of 52 electoral votes from Georgia, Hawaii,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the
District of Columbia.
   The Republicans have averaged at least 55 percent of the vote in
27 states through the same elections, for 208 electoral votes.
   Thus, Democrats would have to win 218 electoral votes among the
17 remaining states to add to their base to return to power in the
White House. The GOP could hold onto its historic base and win the
White House with only 62 electoral votes from the 278 available in
those swing states.
   But Dukakis aides say the appeal to history is a misleading one,
saying the Republican spokesmen are ``trying to erect a historical
barrier between Michael Dukakis and the voters.''
   Democrats point to such states as Iowa _ a traditionally
Republican state _ where Dukakis has a substantial lead in the
polls.
   In addition, a purely regional strategy is tough to pull off, as
differences between the regions shrink and the influence of
national television coverage grows.
   ``The best thing to do is cherry-pick,'' Mellman says, ``taking
a state here in the South, and one there.''
   With the national polls moving dramatically in recent weeks,
Breglio agrees that the fall campaign is going to be
``hand-to-hand, state-by-state'' combat as Bush and Dukakis try for
the magic majority of 270 electoral votes.

   Indigant letters of support are pouring in
from around the country for a man who lost a 50-foot oak tree when
a neighbor cut it down to improve reception for his television
satellite dish.
   ``This despicable act demands redress,'' a Seattle man wrote to
Charles Marriner.
   ``This was a mean and horrible act,'' wrote a resident of New
York's Long Island. ``To discourage others, I urge that you pursue
steps to apply the most severe penalties against him which the law
provides.''
   Arthur Anderson, the neighbor who has admitted felling the
84-year-old tree, reportedly told police after the incident, ``Now
I can get the Disney channel.''
   Anderson was charged with second-degree criminal mischief and
third-degree criminal trespass and is due back in court July 22. He
has offered Marriner $500 in compensation, but Marriner said he
hasn't accepted.
   ``The tree is irreplaceable,'' said Marriner, who discovered the
felled tree on June 12. He said he got one estimate of more than
$9,000 to remove and replace it, along with others that were
damaged by the falling oak.
   A Chicago man suggested what he thought would be fair punishment.
   ``I have no television in Chicago and am not particularly fond
of the dishes that have ruined many a backyard,'' the man wrote.
``Proper retribution, I think, would be to revoke Anderson's right
to have a satellite dish.''
   Calls to Anderson's home for comment Saturday were answered by a
machine.

<TEXT>
   Americans in China celebrated Independence Day on
Saturday with dragon dances, Chinese acrobats, an Air Force band
and 3,000 McDonald's Big Macs.
   More than 1,500 Americans living in China, from Beijing to the
far northwestern Xinjiang province, gathered at the U.S. Embassy in
the capital.
   Chinese guards were posted outside the embassy compound, and a
metal detector was set up at the main entrance.
   Authorities last month warned Americans in Beijing that they
might be the target of terrorists from another country. The third
country was never identified, and the warning was eventually lifted.
   ``We're as safe as in Main Street, U.S.A.,'' said an embassy
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Each year for the past five years, McDonald's in Hong Kong has
flown in thousands of Big Macs for the Fourth of July. But this
year, the McDonald's monopoly over the embassy party was broken by
Kentucky Fried Chicken, which opened its largest restaurant in the
world here in the fall.
   Kentucky Fried Chicken donated 1,000 meals for the celebration,
while 14 McDonald's employees from Hong Kong flipped 3,000 patties
for Americans desperate for a taste of Big Macs.
   The festivities started with an afternoon parade by 70 children
riding bicycles festooned with red, white, and blue streamers or on
roller skates.
   Ambassador Winston Lord, dressed as a cowboy in a white vest,
red shirt and straw hat, called on Americans to exercise their
right to vote in this fall's presidential elections.
   ``There is one important, almost mystical right that Americans
carry wherever our roads may lead. The right to vote,'' he said.
``I encourage you to vote .... There is nothing quite like this
American expression of will.''
   Lord's 10-minute speech ended in a deafening roar of
firecrackers. Two teams of dragon dancers, accompanied by clanging
cymbals, then took over the show.
   Next came the U.S. Air Force pop band, ``Spectrum.'' The band
was flown in from Washington for the occasion.
   Filling the breaks in the band's performance were a lip-sync
contest, a raffle and a performance by a children's chorus from
Beijing's International School.
   Ticket sales covered the cost of the $41,000 event, with a $20
admission for students, teachers and embassy staff, and $30 for
everyone else.

   The suspects, all charged with Mafia association, were arrested
following an investigation by homicide and narcotics agents into
activities of the 'Ndrangheta, the Calabrian version of the Mafia.
   Police Chief Salvatore Patane said warrants were also issued for
10 people already in jail. Eight other suspects remained at large,

between rival 'Ndrangeta clans and their involvement in drug
trafficking, extortion and control of railroad and highway

   A sudden spate of black bear sightings
at parks, fairgrounds, highways, back yards and _ naturally _ honey
bee hives has residents of the western part of the state wondering
if there is a bear boom.
   The bear population has indeed gone up, say wildlife officials.
But the problem comes more from a people boom in the state's
western hills, so the two populations, human and ursine, see each
other more often.
   ``It is a case of people going into a bear's back yard,'' said
Ellie Horwitz, spokeswoman for the state Division of Fisheries and
Wildlife. ``They are farming, putting up bee hives, and are not
taking into consideration that the bears are attracted to these
things. The bears are opportunists and will take advantage of
whatever is easiest and convenient.''
   Authorities haven't released any figures on the number of bears
sighted in residential areas, but Horwitz said, ``None of the bears
we have been made aware of are of any danger to the community.''
   No injuries to either the bears or startled humans have been
reported. While people scurry for cameras and shelter, the usually
docile black bears head back to the woods.
   ``Black bears are relatively small and unaggressive,'' said
Horwitz. ``Some people will describe them as looking like fat dogs.
But they really don't look like dogs at all. A well-fed bear will
have a round body and a small head with an elongated face.''
   ``A black bear that gets up to 400 pounds in Massachusetts is
considered to be a very large bear, although in other areas they
may get up to 600 pounds,'' she said. By contrast, grizzly bears in
the West can reach 1,500 pounds.
   Black bears can be aggressive in some circumstances. At Vail,
Colo., one chased a 14-year-old boy last weekend after the youth
photographed the animal. Colorado wildlife officials have set bear
traps around the posh resort because as many as eight bears have
been feasting on trash dumps.
   In Massachusetts, an estimated 500 bears roam the
400-square-mile area between the Berkshire Mountains and
Connecticut River north of the Massachusetts Turnpike _ the general
area where the sightings have been reported. In the mid-1970s, it
was thought only 100 bears lived in the state.
   Ronald Wilkinson, chief of police at Look Memorial Park, says he
can no longer hike on half the trails he frequented as a boy
because so many vacation and summer homes have been built.
   ``Many of the areas are taken up with development. You can still
walk through them, but you could be considered a trespasser,'' he
said. ``There are some very exclusive and secluded developments
going up.''
   Wayne McCallum, assistant director of the state wildlife agency,
said the number of sightings indicates two problems: a loss of
natural habitat for the bears due to increased residential
development and a possible change in people's attitudes toward the
animals.
   ``When people build a house in the middle of the woods,
sometimes up to a quarter-mile in from the road, the bears are not
going to move out,'' he said.
   ``Most people like bears. They are fascinated by them,''
McCallum said. ``But when so many people move from urban areas to
rural areas and bring their urban attitudes, treating the wild
animals as pets, managing the wildlife population becomes very
difficult.''
   At the same time, he said, farmers who claim to have lost crops
or livestock to bears tend to view the animals as pests. Farmers in

   About 50,000 refugees herding
flocks of camels and goats have fled the civil war in neighboring
Somalia and sought sanctuary in Ethiopia, officials said Saturday.
   Relief workers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 60,000
others were massed on the northwestern border waiting to cross into
Ethiopia if the conflict continues between the Somali National
Movement rebels and government forces.
   Aid officials said the influx was placing an added strain on
Ethiopia's limited resources. The country has about 3 million
starving people, and rebels are fighting Ethiopian forces in civil
wars in the northern provinces of Tigre and Eritrea.
   The refugees are being housed in Ethiopia at camps run jointly
by the Marxist government and the U.N. High Commission for Refugees.
   Relief officials said the refugees claimed persecution by
President Siad Barre's government. Barre seized power in a 1969
coup. Since 1977, he has been a staunch ally of the United States.
   The rebel army, which has pledged to overthrow the government
and hold national elections, a month ago mounted a major offensive
in the north and seized several key towns, including the regional
capital of Burao.
   Rebels have charged the government with indiscriminate shelling
and bombing of northern cities.
   The rebel movement was formed seven years ago and is led by
Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo, a former Barre Cabinet member.

<HEAD>Shultz Preaches Democracy In Central America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sounding much like the college professor he
once was, Secretary of State George P. Shultz took a back-to-basics
message to four friendly Central American countries last week:
democracy works, Marxism doesn't.
   During visits to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa
Rica, Shultz repeated that theme time and again, urging the
countries and their peoples to stay on their democratic course and
to reject Nicaraguan-style Marxism.
   As Shultz saw it, the four democracies, three of which are
relative newborns, now boast of economic growth, declining
inflation and improved social services.
   In contrast, Shultz said, living standards in Nicaragua have
dropped by two-thirds over the past four months, inflation is
``sure to exceed 2,000 per cent this year, and tens of thousands of
workers are paid less than the cost of subsistence.''
   Shultz's optimistic appraisal of the four democracies seemed
excessive to some analysts. Shultz himself saw some of the despair
still plaguing the region, particularly on Thursday as he raced
from Guatemala to El Salvador to Honduras and back to Guatemala.
   In El Salvador, a country where fully half the labor force is
unable to find adequate employment, armed rebellion continues, and
human rights abuses, after a long period of decline, are now on the
increase.
   Shultz called democracy the ``way of the future'' in Central
America but many Salvadorans obviously are not convinced.
   The atmosphere was far more tranquil in Honduras, but there
Shultz could see the fruits of an appalling housing shortage:
people by the thousands living in shelters consisting of little
more than sheets of corrugated metal.
   Shultz's point, though, was that Central America's democracies,
for all their problems, are moving ahead, while Nicaragua's living
standards continue to retrogress.
   Shultz did his best to deflect attention during his trip from
the pending debate in Washington over aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   But the Contras, normally a U.S. ally, upset this design after a
meeting late Thursday night with Shultz at his hotel in Guatemala
City.
   With the stall in efforts to reach peace between the Contras and
the Sandinistas, the rebels offered tantalizing details of a new
aid strategy they are developing in cooperation with the
administration and their supporters on Capitol Hill.
   Administration officials said only four minutes of the hour-long
session was devoted to the possibility of resuming military aid to
the Contras. If that's true, it may have been an important four
minutes, given the divisiveness of Contra aid as an election year
campaign issue.
   The Contras, now limited to a $17 million package of
humanitarian aid and deprived of military aid since late February,
have little support among liberals. Democratic front runner Michael
Dukakis has said that lethal aid to the rebels is illegal.
   Adolfo Calero, a Contra directorate member, said the morning
after the rebels' meeting with Shultz that the secretary was ``very
enthusiastic'' about a new Contra aid proposal that was discussed.
   Calero said a $30 million aid package being considered by the
administration, of which perhaps $7 million would be spent as
military aid if Nicaragua, failed to fulfill promises of democratic
reform.
   The night before, Alfredo Cesar, another Contra leader, had
talked of a revolutionary new wrinkle in the Contra aid debate. He
said that as a sweetener for the Sandinistas, they would receive
economic aid if they implemented democratic reform.
   Shultz apparently hopes that with so many Nicaraguan lives at
risk because of economic deprivation, the Sandinistas may be ready
to rethink their strategy on how their society should be
constructed.
   He also believes the more military and diplomatic pressure is
placed on the Sandinistas, the more the rethinking process will be
accelerated.

   A prosperous real estate broker who was
raised in poverty says she'd rather send a kindergarten class of
underprivileged students to college than see her money sit in the
bank.
   Oral Brown, the 43-year-old owner of Nationwide Realty, is
planning to finance a college education for 27 kindergarteners at
Brookfield Elementary School.
   ``If the money is sitting in the bank, what good is it doing
there, except paying off some ... taxes? I'd rather give it to
someone where it can do some good,'' said Brown.
   Each year for 12 years, Brown will deposit $10,000 in a bank
account to pay college tuition for those students who graduate in
1999 and go on to college.
   ``I figured we can either help these kids now or sit back and
say, `What's wrong with America?' '' she said.
   Brown was raised in poverty in the dusty Mississippi town of
Batesville. She was 17 when she arrived in the San Francisco area,
where she and her husband raised three daughters.
   Brown worked at night and attended college, earning a bachelor's
degree from the University of San Francisco.

   Malik P. Young said he had to drive himself to
get good grades, and now he'll be driving away in his reward _ a
new automobile.
   The 17-year-old has been awarded a 1988 Plymouth Horizon for his
academic achievements by a pastor who founded an incentive program
to motivate youngsters to stay in school.
   ``I didn't strive for the car. My goal was to be No. 1 in the
class. The car is what I got for the struggle,'' said Young, the
valedictorian at Wendell Phillips High School, which has a dropout
rate of 61 percent.
   Young, who graduated with a 4.0 grade point average, plans to
study engineering in the fall at Howard University.
   He credits his parents with teaching him that ``education is the
key,'' but said he had to struggle for his achievements. His mother
is on public aid and his father lives in Washington, D.C.
   When he started high school, Young said he was ``a nothing
student.''
   ``Then I decided I wanted to graduate with honors and go to a
good college. Honors is clout,'' he said.
   Before Young can get into the driver's seat, he still has one
more roadblock to clear _ a driver's education course.

   The naturalization ceremony was conducted as part of this city's
International Freedom Festival.
   ``I can now eat hamburgers and say, `Hey, dude, what's your

<TEXT>
   The slayings of three men and a child in
Texas are the latest in a series of deaths and disappearances
believed linked to a violent sect of polygamists still faithful to
a vengeful patriarch who died seven years ago.
   Internal violence has long marked the cult of Ervil LeBaron, a
self-proclaimed prophet whose quest for power and teaching of blood
atonement launched a 22-year reign of terror among Mormon
fundamentalists.
   The killings in Texas, which police suspect are the work of
three of LeBaron's sons, bring to 18 the number of LeBaron's former
disciples who have died or disappeared over the past two decades.
   In Utah, where LeBaron was convicted of masterminding the 1977
murder of rival polygamist leader Rulon Allred, members of other
polygamist groups are horrified at the bloodshed, a professor said.
   ``They're disgusted, and some of them are a bit frightened,''
said John Stewart of Utah State University, who has studied
polygamist groups. ``Most of them are peaceful and mostly
law-abiding, except for the polygamy, of course.''
   LeBaron's Church of the Lamb of God is but one of many groups
who advocate a return to polygamy, which was taught by Joseph
Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   The Utah-based church banned polygamy in 1890 and excommunicates
those who practice it. Nevertheless, an estimated 20,000 to 30,000
people are believed to live in polygamist families.
   At the heart of the struggle may be the fundamentalist belief
that God will send ``one mighty and strong'' to reform the Mormon
Church, by violence, if necessary.
   ``That has been the thing that has been a deluding scripture for
all these splinter group leaders for the past 100 years,'' Stewart
said. ``It leads to this egomaniacal approach that leads to
continual splintering.
   ``This process has been going on for a long time and undoubtedly
will continue to do so,'' he said.
   Among others knowledgeable about the clan, there is little
surprise that the young LeBarons are suspects in the June 27
killings of Eddie Marston, 32, in the Dallas suburb of Irving, and
brothers Mark Chynoweth, 36, Duane Chynoweth, 31, and Duane's
8-year-old daughter, Jennifer, in Houston.
   Marston was a stepson of LeBaron and Mark Chynoweth was married
to LeBaron's daughter, Lillian.
   Texas detectives are seeking LeBaron's sons, Andrew, 28; Heber,
27; and Aaron, 20, for questioning.
   ``I would think they certainly would be considered prime
suspects, inasmuch as since Ervil died, there have been these
threats made to other former members of the LeBaron organization,''
said Murray Police Lt. Paul Forbes, the chief investigator in
Allred's slaying.
   LeBaron died of a heart attack at Utah State Prison in 1981. But
Lillian Chynoweth has said that he targeted a number of people for
death for being unfaithful to his teachings.
   Those who have died or vanished since 1966 have included LeBaron
followers, brothers, nephews, wives, critics and rivals.
   Marston and Mark Chynoweth were acquitted of charges in the
Allred slaying, and Marston also was acquitted in the 1975 death of
Robert H. Simons, another polygamist who challenged LeBaron.
   In October 1987, Daniel Ben Jordan, who had split with the
LeBaron group and moved his polygamous family to Colorado, was
fatally shot at a deer-hunting camp in southeastern Utah.
   LeBaron and Jordan both claimed to be the ``one mighty and
strong,'' as did Leo Evoniuk, who founded his own church after
LeBaron's death and vanished from Santa Cruz, Calif., in May 1987.
   Rena Chynoweth, a widow of Ervil LeBaron and sister of the slain
Chynoweth brothers who has gone into hiding since her brothers'
deaths, considers the LeBaron sons to be seriously unbalanced, said
her attorney, John O'Connell of Salt Lake City. She believes she is
also on LeBaron's ``hit list,'' said O'Connell.
   ``The Chynoweths and Marston all were raised in the church, as
were these boys who are running around now,'' he said.
   ``But they were intelligent, rational people. They were involved
in some things, but as time went on, they could see that it just
wasn't making sense and they got out,'' O'Connell said.

   A car plowed into a group of 87 West
Germans walking to a religious festival, killing a policeman
escorting them and injuring 12 of the pilgrims, officials said
Saturday.
   The accident occurred late Friday near Weiden, about 45 miles
northeast of Nuremberg in Bavaria state.
   The Roman Catholic pilgrims were walking along the side of a
road, en route to nearby Amberg for a religious festival Saturday,
police said.
   Police said a 25-year-old man lost control of his vehicle and
plowed into the group. A 39-year-old policeman was killed, and some
of the pilgrims suffered serious injuries, police said.
   The pilgrims had taken many precautions to ensure their safety
along their walk, police said, including wearing fluorescent vests
and carrying blinking lights. The police escort was also intended
to ensure their safety.
   Police were trying to track down two cars that passed the group
seconds before the accident. Those two automobiles apparently were
traveling on the wrong side of the road after passing the pilgrims
and may have caused the man to lose control of his car, police said.

   President Reagan, in a Fourth of July weekend
radio broadcast, urged Americans today to ``defend America's
precious heritage'' by voting on election day, helping others and
attending to their families and jobs.
   ``As we celebrate our independence and pause to give thanks for
our liberty, let us also remember that the freedoms we cherish are
never more than a generation away from extinction,'' Reagan said in
his weekly radio address.
   The president spoke from Camp David, the presidential retreat in
Maryland, where he is spending the weekend. He will return Monday
to watch the annual Washington fireworks show from a White House
balcony.
   ``It's up to each of us to preserve, protect and defend
America's precious heritage,'' the president said. ``Some of us
have done just that on the battlefield. But all of us can do it
each and every day.
   ``We can vote at electiontime. We can volunteer to help
political campaigns for the candidates of our choice, as well as
volunteer for work that's needed around our community. And we can
simply raise our children well, do our jobs well and live in God's
light.''

election year. We are about to choose a new president.''
   ``We can give America a new beginning,'' Byrd said. ``Celebrate
your freedom in the most meaningful way this year. Participate.
Exercise that most important uniquely American privilege. Vote. Get

   In a written Fourth of July message, Reagan said that each
celebration of the holiday marking the signing of the Declaration
of Independence stirs ``the pure patriotism of childhood.''
   ``With each flag, with each parade and picnic and burst of
fireworks, we can't help but recall the first stirrings of our deep
love for America,'' the president said. ``No matter how many
Fourths we Americans have seen, every new one revives in our hearts
the pure patriotism of childhood.''
   The full text of Reagan's message is as follows:
   ``The Fourth of July is much more than a date on the calendar _
it is celebrated here in the United States, and recognized around
the world, as a turning point in history. No matter how many
Fourths we Americans have seen, every new one revives in our hearts
the pure patriotism of childhood. With each flag, with each parade
and picnic and burst of fireworks, we can't help but recall the
first stirrings of our deep love for America.
   ``This year, on our nation's 212th birthday, we recall another
special anniversary, the bicentennial of our first Independence Day
under our newly ratified Constitution. In his diary entry for that
date, John Quincy Adams recorded how the news of the latest state
ratification was received in Boston: `(I)mmediately the bells were
set to ringing, and the guns to firing again, without any mercy,
and continued all the remainder of the afternoon.' For two
centuries now, the Constitution whose birth these patriots so
exuberantly hailed has endured, ensuring our liberty and preserving
this great Republic.
   ``The passage of time has only brought us even more reason to
celebrate. Our founders marked the Fourth of July, uncertain that
the union would be formed; our ancestors at the time of the Civil
War marked it as well, uncertain that the union would survive, and
our parents and grandparents marked it, uncertain that it would
withstand the ravages of global conflict. We can rejoice _ and be
grateful to God _ that peace and prosperity, the hope of every
generation, reign for us on this July 4, 1988.
   ``To all my fellow Americans, happy Fourth of July.''

   A jury today ordered that Gary Michael
Heidnik die in the electric chair for killing two of six women he
imprisoned in a basement torture chamber.
   Jurors, who on Friday convicted Heidnik of first-degree murder
in the slayings of Sandra Lindsay and Deborah Dudley, deliberated
about 90 minutes before reaching a verdict on a sentence. The
sentence will automatically be reviewed by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court.
   During a sentencing hearing today, a prosecutor had asked the
jurors to impose the death sentence. They could have sentenced
Heidnik to life in prison.
   ``This man is legally sane and he knew what he was doing and he
did it with torture,'' Assistant District Attorney Charles
Gallagher told jurors, who could have given Heidnik a life sentence.
   ``Death is the correct sentence,'' Gallagher said.
   Heidnik's lawyer, A. Charles Peruto Jr., appealed to the jurors
to consider that Heidnik suffers from a severe mental disease.
Heidnik did not testify at the sentencing hearing.
   ``I just hope you do the right thing,'' Peruto said after being
directed by Common Pleas Judge Lynne Abraham not to rehash previous
testimony from the trial, which featured survivors' tales of
cannibalism and sadism.
   The jury on Friday rejected Heidnik's insanity defense,
convicting him of two counts of first-degree murder, six charges of
kidnapping, five of rape, four of aggravated assault and one of
involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.
   Peruto said Friday his client expects the death penalty and
wants no appeal.
   ``Don't bother,'' Peruto quoted Heidnik as saying. ``Let's get
it over with.''
   Heidnik, 44, was accused of butchering the body of one woman he
had abducted and then feeding some of her cooked flesh to four
other abducted women he imprisoned in his North Philadelphia
basement, which was labeled a ``house of horrors'' during the trial.
   Prosecutors say he raped the women repeatedly in hopes of
breeding ``a superior race'' between November 1986 and his arrest
in March 1987. The four survivors testified at his trial.
   Heidnik's attorney conceded that his client committed the
crimes, but said he was mentally ill and was not aware of what he
was doing.
   If the jurors fail to agree on a sentence on the two murder
counts, the judge must automatically impose a life in prison term.
   The judge will impose a sentence on the other charges later.
   The jurors, chosen in Pittsburgh because of pretrial publicity
here over the bizarre case, received the case Wednesday and, over
three days, spent nearly 18 hours before reaching their unanimous
decision.
   There was one verdict of innocent, on a charge of involuntary
deviate sexual intercourse with a prostitute who had escaped
Heidnik's house in March 1987 and brought police to the rescue of
the other three chained women.
   ``Thank God it was guilty of first-degree,'' said Teresa Lomax,
sister of Sandra Lindsay, whose body was sawed apart in Heidnik's
house after she died while chained to a pipe, according to police.
Some of her remains were fed to other captives.
   ``He deserved, `Guilty, guilty, guilty.' Now I'm hoping for the
death penalty,'' Ms. Lomax said. ``That was a brutal way for my
sister to die, tortured. Nobody deserves to die like that.''
   Diane Dudley said Heidnik ``got what he deserved'' for
electrocuting Deborah Dudley, her sister, by touching live wires to
her chains while she stood in a water-filled basement pit. Her body
was found in a wooded area in New Jersey.
   ``Now I hope he gets the chair and Debbie can rest in peace,''
Ms. Dudley said.
   Peruto called the verdict ``a big letdown'' because he had
thought his insanity defense had made an impact on the jurors.
   Gallagher was elated and called it ``a just decision.''
   In closing arguments, Peruto told jurors Heidnik was a
``fruitcake'' who suffered from schizophrenia, a mental illness
first diagnosed in 1963 and for which he was discharged from the
Army. He contended Heidnik suffered from delusions and ``didn't
realize the quality of his acts.''
   Gallagher insisted that Heidnik was faking the illness.
   Peruto had claimed Heidnik was treated with LSD while a hospital
patient during Army service in West Germany in 1962, but said he
was unable to obtain hospital records.
   Heidnik later founded a church in which he proclaimed himself a
bishop, and allegedly used contributions to the church to play the
stock market. His stock transactions were so successful that he
amassed more than $500,000.
   Despite his wealth, Heidnik lived in a poor neighborhood and
appeared in court in tattered clothes.

   Ten years ago, Bernard Henschel was
atop the Wisconsin farming industry after he and his wife were
selected one of Wisconsin's outstanding young farm couples.
   But after a decade of price fluctuation, market instability and
this year's devastating drought, the dairy farmer has second
thoughts about the career he chose when he was a brash 20-year-old.
   ``Well, I guess it isn't as good as I thought it would be,'' he
said Friday. ``When I started in this I thought by the time I got
to be 40 _ I'm 43 right now _ I wouldn't have to worry about my
investments in farming.
   ``I just haven't got ahead like I thought I would. Nowadays,
farmers can't get ahead as easy.''
   Henschel and his wife, Allis, operate a 350-acre farm about two
miles outside this northeastern Wisconsin community. They own about
200 head of cattle, including 90 milking cows.
   Just 10 years after he was selected the area's top young farmer
by the Mid-States Region of the Associated Milk Producers Inc.,
Henschel's fortunes have changed.
   An eight-week drought has parched his first two hay crops and
left him without enough feed for his Holsteins. He recently sold 11
cows because he could no longer feed them and more could be sold
later if his third hay crop is not productive.
   ``I've never seen it this dry as long as I've been farming,'' he
said. ``Our second (hay) crop, there's not much there so we'll be
cutting soon and looking to get a third crop in.
   ``But without a couple of good rains, there won't be much there
either.''
   The drought is just one of several factors that have forced
hundreds of Wisconsin farmers into bankruptcy, foreclosure, selling
out, or retirement in the last decade.
   ``I think the prices and the cost of equipment compared to what
you get for your products is the main reason,'' Henschel said. He
said the price per hundredweight of milk, about 12 gallons, has
dropped in the last five years from $13 to $10.50.
   During the same time, equipment and overhead costs have risen,
he said.
   Had it not been for the drought, farmers were expecting a year
of recovery after three to five years of financial trouble, ``but
the way things are going ... I don't see how we can come out of
it,'' he said.
   Henschel began farming independently at age 20 after growing up
on his father's farm. He began by forming a partnership with his
brother, in which the two shared machinery and manpower. Since
then, Henschel has taken over his father's farm and expanded it.
   During his award-winning year in 1978, he produced about
1,446,320 pounds of milk and 52,564 pounds of butter from 80 cows.
This year he expects to produce 1,710,000 pounds of milk and 62,100
pounds butter from 90 cows.
   But much more than production has changed over the last 10
years. Henschel's father died and he was forced to let go of his
longtime hired hand. Henschel must now rely on his wife, daughter,
son-in-law, and two teen-age sons for help.
   ``Since then, farming's gotten tighter and it's come to where
you can't afford to hire a full-time farmhand any longer,'' he
explained.

   Eight tons of TNT exploded at an anti-aircraft
base near the eastern city of Khabarovsk, smashing windows in
almost 200 homes and injuring some people, the newspaper Izvestia
said Saturday.
   ``There were no deaths, but there are injuries. Basically,
people received cuts from glass broken out of window frames by the
force of the blast,'' Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the chief of the Soviet
military staff, told the officials government newspaper.
   It did not say how many people were hurt.
   Izvestia said the explosion took place late on the evening of
June 29 at an anti-aircraft base eight kilometers (five miles)
south of Khabarovsk, a city of about 600,000 people located just
north of the Chinese border.
   Windows were shattered in almost 200 homes of an outlying region
of Kabarovsk. A poultry-processing factory, two hospitals, 38
stores and several schools and kindergartens also were damaged, the
newspaper said.
   The Soviet military was helping repair the damage, and a special
commission was appointed to investigate the blast, it said.
   The cause had not yet been determined, it said.

<HEAD>Catamaran Fleet Opens Up Thames to Commuter Traffic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fleet of jet-powered catamarans has opened the
British capital's last uncrowded thoroughfare _ the River Thames _
to commuter traffic.
   ``There's nothing else like this: an intensive river shuttle
service in the center of London,'' said Roger Mabbott, deputy
managing director of Thames Line PLC.
   Since the service's debut June 1, the firm's three boats have
cruised past cars on choked streets to ferry about 600 passengers a
day from central London to the booming Docklands area.
   The catamarans _ twin-hulled boats that can reach speeds of
about 28 mph _ carry up to 62 passengers and are powered by two
turbo-charged Volvo jet engines.
   One leaves Charing Cross Pier in London's West End every 15
minutes from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. for a five-mile journey to the Isle
of Dogs, heart of the sprawling Docklands redevelopment area, where
decrepit warehouses are being turned into modern residential and
light industry complexes.
   The full trip with two stops takes 20 minutes. A similar journey
on the London Underground subway takes up to 30 minutes, London
Regional Transport spokesmen said.
   One big difference is the price. The subway trip costs 80 pence,
or $1.36, each way. The catamaran ride costs 4 pounds, or $7.20,
each way.
   ``There's an element to competing with all forms of transport,''
Mabbott said, ``but what we're looking to provide is service to
places the Underground, buses and cars don't get to easily.''
   Traditional ferries have not operated with the speed or
frequency of the Thames Line catamarans, Mabbott said.
   Thames Line PLC was established with $8.1 million in 1986 to
simultaneously develop property in the Docklands and create a river
shuttle for the growing number of people living and working there.
   Mabbott said Thames Line's operating costs for June broke even
at $108,600 to $126,700, with the boats carrying an average of five
passengers per trip.
   He expects 80 percent of the passengers to be commuters or
business people with an interest in the Docklands, and 20 percent
tourists.
   Passengers last week gave Thames Line generally favorable
reviews, but one said some problems still need working out.
   Hugh Mackay, 45, a civil engineer from the northern London
suburb of Rickmansworth, complained his boat left Charing Cross
Pier 20 minutes late.
   ``They need to improve their scheduling if business people are
going to use it,'' he said.
   Rhonda Kufluk, 36, a property developer, lives in the Docklands
and uses the service daily. ``It's wonderful,'' she said. ``I hate
taxi cabs. The Tube (subway) tends to be overcrowded and
uncomfortable.''
   Thames Line plans to put four more boats in operation by October
and extend its service farther east past Charing Cross to Chelsea
and farther west to Greenland Pier in the Docklands, Mabbott said.

<TEXT>
   Miss America is not supposed to
portray the innocent bathing beauty anymore _ she's a career woman
who is educated and articulate, and she may not even be a virgin,
says the pageant's new director.
   Miss America contestants, says Leonard Horn, are human beings
living in a very liberal 20th century.
   ``They sweat. They're nervous, they've made mistakes. They may
not all be virgins. I don't know whether they are or not. Who
cares?'' Horn says. ``I'm sure that if we found out 25 or 30 years
ago that a girl lived with somebody or had intercourse, she
wouldn't make the morals clause.''
   ``Today? Come on!'' he says with a laugh.
   In an interview last week, Horn described what could become
sweeping changes to assure that the public never again views Miss
America as just a beauty queen.
   The Atlantic City attorney, who has volunteered with the pageant
for the past 25 years, replaced Albert Marks as director of the
68-year-old contest, ending Marks' 35-year reign.
   The biggest challenge for pageant directors always has been
attracting television viewers in the same age group as the
contestants. The contest has a loyal following of older women and
young starry-eyed girls, but young college and career women often
spurn the event as old-fashioned, Horn said.
   This year's pageant will emphasize the contestants' backgrounds
much more, he said.
   ``These women are interesting individuals,'' Horn said.
``They're thinking human beings. You can get any one of them in an
intense conversation. And for the most part, they're pretty
courageous kids to put themselves on the line for some specific
goal, whether it's for a scholarship or displaying their derriere _
which is probably not the case anymore.''
   Some standards still apply, however. Horn said former Miss
America Vanessa Williams had to be dethroned after nude photographs
were published in order to protect the integrity of a pageant that
still wants young girls to dream about the crown.
   The pageant also is not seeking only drop-dead-gorgeous
contestants.
   ``If a young woman considered herself to be the ugliest person
in the world, she could still enter a local pageant,'' Horn said.
``Those who enter these contests enter because they are confident
enough of their beauty. So what is defined as `beauty' is
self-limiting by the contestants.''
   An updated stage production is planned as a way to reshape the
contest's image.
   Tony and Emmy award-winning Broadway producer Donald Pippin will
be music director for this year's show, replacing Glen and Edna
Osser, who have handled the productions for the past 35 years.
   ``They did a great job, but there comes a time when you've got
to change things,'' Horn said. ``The music has to be more upbeat.
We don't want to go into hard rock, but we are dealing with young
people so we don't want to turn them off.''
   Another change aimed at luring more viewers will be bringing in
celebrity judges on the final night of the pageant to pick from the
top 10 contestants, Horn said.
   This year's pageant will be held Sept. 10, a week earlier than
usual to accommodate NBC-TV's coverage of the Olympic games. Horn
said that next year the pageant might be moved from its traditional
Saturday night television slot, aired live from 10 p.m. to midnight.
   ``Some sponsors feel we can do better in prime time, like maybe
Sunday or Monday evening,'' he said.
   Horn's most controversial change might be in the way he will
revise seating in Atlantic City's Convention Center.
   Many of the reserved boxes near the runway have been passed down
among generations of Miss America supporters, but now will be given
to the pageant's eight sponsors for their executives. Some of the
resort's casinos have been offered a chance to buy boxes _ at a
hefty premium _ for their high rollers.
   Horn denies that the pageant has become too commercial.
   ``Just because someone has been sitting in a box for 30 years,''
he said, ``does not mean they should be filling a box that can be
filled more financially in order to keep the pageant here in
Atlantic City.''

<HEAD>Reagan, Democrats Offer Same Holiday Advice: Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan and Senate Democratic leader
Robert C. Byrd on Saturday both offered the same election-year
Fourth of July advice for Americans: Vote.
   ``It's up to each of us to preserve, protect and defend
America's precious heritage,'' the president said in his weekly
radio address.
   ``Some of us have done just that on the battlefield. But all of
us can do it each and every day.
   ``We can vote at election time. We can volunteer to help
political campaigns for the candidates of our choice, as well as
volunteer for work that's needed around our community. And we can
simply raise our children well, do our jobs well and live in God's
light.''
   Byrd, the Senate majority leader from West Virginia, said in the
Democratic response to the president's speech that Independence Day
in 1988 ``is different because this year we must choose a new path
for America.''
   ``This is an election year,'' Byrd said. ``We are about to
choose a new president.''
   ``Celebrate your freedom in the most meaningful way this year,''
he said. ``Participate. Exercise that most important uniquely
American privilege. Vote.''
   Reagan spoke from Camp David, the presidential retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains of Maryland, where he and first lady Nancy
Reagan are spending the weekend. The Reagans will return to
Washington Monday and watch the traditional capital fireworks show
from a balcony of the White House.

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded today
outside a crowded Johannesburg sports stadium, killing at least two
people and injuring 26, police said.
   The blast occurred on a street alongside Ellis Park stadium
minutes after the end of the rugby match between Transvaal and
Orange Free State, said police spokesman Pierre Louw.
   Louw said the two men killed were white. Among the injured, 23
are white, two are black and one is Asian, Louw said.
   The stadium seats about 75,000 people and is the largest
sporting facility in the Johannesburg area. The attendance figure
was not immediately available, but Saturday afternoon matches
generally attract at least 25,000 fans.
   Sportswriters covering the match said they saw flames leaping 60
yards into the air following the explosion, the South African Press
Association reported. They said the blast occurred just outside an
entrance gate to the stadium, SAPA said.
   Several surrounding buildings in the downtown area were set
ablaze, but were extinguished by firemen within several minutes,
witnesses said.
   Metal from the car that exploded was found up to 200 yards away
from the blast, witnesses added. Several additional cars also were
damaged they said.
   Police immediately blocked off the area and began checking
nearby parked cars for additional explosives.
   Rugby is the most popular team sport among white South Africans,
and tens of thousands of whites regularly attend weekend matches at
Ellis Park.
   The bombing was the latest in a recent series of attacks aimed
at civilian targets. There have been more than 90 bombings since
the government declared a natinwide state of emergency in June
1986, including some 25 this year.
   Police have blamed virtually all the attacks on the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla group, the main black
organization attempting to overthrow the white-led government.
   The group, based in Lusaka, Zambia, seldom confirms or denies
involvement in specific attacks. However, recent statements by
African National Congress leaders have suggested that the
organization approves of attacks on civilian targets.
   On Thursday, 13 whites and one black were hurt by a bomb that
exploded outside a fast food restaurant in a Johannesburg shopping
center at the Poyntons Building, which houses the air force and
prison service headquarters on upper floors.
   Hospital officials said none was hurt seriously. Two of the
injured people were children.
   The country is run under a system of apartheid, a policy of
segregation that preserves power and privilege for South Africa's 5
million whites and denies rights and a voice in national affairs to
its 26 million blacks.
   On Friday, the government proposed tough measures to enforce
residential segregation, and critics said it could mean mass
eviction of blacks from white areas. The bills are to be debated in
August.
   The government has not strictly enforced the 35-year-old act
Group Areas Act in recent years, which restricts blacks to certain
areas. The proposed amendment to the act calls for the hiring of
inspectors to check violations of the law.
   It would make it easier for authorities to confiscate property
and to evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated
for their race group.
   On June 10, President P.W. Botha extended for a third year the
country's state of emergency.

   Here are major events in the investigation of
alleged procurement fraud and bribery involving government
officials, defense contractors and consultants:
   JUNE 14: Pursuing what FBI spokesman Gregory Jones calls
``allegations of fraud and bribery,'' FBI and Naval Investigative
Service agents raid the offices of Pentagon officials, defense
contractors and consultants.
   More than 30 locations are searched in 12 states and the
District of Columbia. Law enforcement sources say the searches are
part of a two-year probe that has included wiretaps.
   Targets include Melvyn Paisley, a former assistant Navy
secretary who became a consultant to several aerospace contractors
immediately upon leaving the Pentagon. Also searched are the
Pentagon offices of Victor Cohen, a top Air Force acquisitions
official, and James Gaines, deputy assistant Navy secretary for
acquisitions, as well as offices and plants of some of the
country's largest defense contractors, among them McDonnell Douglas
Corp. in St. Louis, United Technologies Corp. in Washington and
Unisys Corp. in Minneapolis and New York.

<HEAD>Controversial Dukakis Prison Siting Enters Presidential Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW BRAINTREE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a hilltop overlooking this tiny
town is what Gov. Michael Dukakis believes is the perfect site for
a new prison and what opponents of that plan say is the centerpiece
of a corrupt land deal.
   The 782 acres in rural New Braintree, home of a defunct
religious academy and perhaps a future prison, is the battlefield
for a two-year war over the prison plans that is intensifying as
the state moves to buy the property and Dukakis, now the certain
Democratic presidential nominee, eyes the White House.
   Dukakis spent much of 1986 defending his choice of the site and
was drawn back into the fray last month, when the FBI acknowledged
it was conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations by prison
opponents that developers who bought the property for $3.2 million
and quickly offered it to the state for $9.5 million were given
inside information about the plans.
   Dukakis, who the FBI said was not a subject of the
investigation, and administration officials have flatly rejected
allegations there were improper deals and suggested prison
opponents sharpened their attack to get attention during the
presidential campaign.
   ``I don't have any interest in that,'' insists Dorothea
Thomas-Vitrac, the vocal leader of New Braintree's opposition group
_ Conserve Our Small Town. ``We are going after our sitting
governor, not after a presidential candidate.''
   Dukakis' Republican opponent in the fall election, Vice
President George Bush, has steered clear of the controversy.
``Given the fact that it is under some kind of investigation, we
would have no comment,'' said Bush spokewoman Alix Glen.
   But it has drawn national attention because it involves a
central element of the Dukakis candidacy _ a pledge to bring
integrity and competence to the White House _ and offers a glimpse
at his handling of a complex and controversial issue.
   Dukakis named the site for a prison in 1986 and opponents, who
had organized when the state first considered the land two years
earlier, complained that a facility for 500 inmates and several
hundred staff members would overwhelm the town of barely 800 people.
   Thomas-Vitrac concedes opponents have no hard evidence that the
developers were tipped off but contends there ``have to be smoking
guns'' among more than 100 documents Dukakis refuses to make
public, citing executive privilege.
   ``The governor, for reasons known only to him, has lied about
his knowledge of this siting,'' Thomas-Vitrac said last week.
   Dukakis has repeatedly said he did not know who owned the land
when he picked it and requested up to $10 million to buy it. Notes
of an administration aide appear to show one of the developers
names came up twice during a meeting with prison opponents in
Dukakis' office, but the governor has said he does not recall that
and aides have said the name was mentioned only is passing.
   ``The bottom line is that this is a `not in my backyard issue'
and the rest of it is frankly nonsense,'' said James Circo, a
former Dukakis aide who handled the project. ``You'd have to have
been in an igloo somewhere to not know we were looking for prison
space across the state and that New Braintree was one.''
   Thomas-Vitrac contends the withheld documents contain some
reference to developers Daniel Striar and Gary Jacobson. The town
had an agreement with the Seventh Day Adventists Church that the
land would not be sold for a project not in the town's interests.
Thomas-Vitrac contends Striar and Jacobson were Dukakis allies used
to serve as middlemen so the state could get the land without a
fight and reward the developers would with a triple return on their
investment.
   Dukakis denies any deal took place and has said he met Striar
only once. Massachusetts Republicans have been distributing a photo
of that meeting _ on a crowded platform during a 1986
groundbreaking for a community center named for Striar's parents.
Jacobson grew up in the same neighborhood as Dukakis and has
donated to his campaigns, but both men said they are nothing more
than casual acquaintances.
   Striar and Jacobson say they learned of the state's interest
through their broker and that they only considered selling to the
state after local officials rejected their plans to build a
psychiatric hospital.
   An unlikely Dukakis defender, Republican U.S. Attorney Frank
McNamara, said Thurday that he confirmed publicly that Dukakis was
not under investigation ``because I felt it was necessary to
respond to the gossip, innuendo and smear that might sully an
otherwise unsullied reputation.''
   Two appraisals estimate the site's worth between $5 million and
$6 million, according to three Dukakis administration aides, all of
whom requested anonymity. A third appraisal will be completed this
week.
   Negotiations with Striar and Jacobson then will begin, and the
state plans to offer much less than the $9.5 million sought by the
owners two years ago. The two sides may end up in court if no
agreement is reached and the state seeks to take to land by
emminent domain.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan
participated in a ground breaking ceremony for a chapel at Camp
David Saturday, the White House announced.
   The Reagans are spending the weekend at the presidential retreat
in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland.
   The interfaith chapel, scheduled for completion in early 1989,
will have seats for 150 persons.
   Worshipers will enter the chapel through a bell tower with a
bell from the U.S.S. Endicott, a destroyer that saw action in World
War II.
   Funds for construction of the chapel are being raised by a
non-profit corporation known as the Camp David Chapel Fund Inc.,
organized by Kenneth Plummer Sr.,a semiretired construction
contractor from Chambersburg, Pa.
   Plummer camped in the area that now makes up Camp David when he
was a Boy Scout, before it was opened as a presidential retreat for
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, under the name ``Shangri-La,'' in
1942.
   The first donation to the chapel fund, in the amount of $1,000,
was made by the president and Mrs. Reagan.
   Attending the ground breaking ceremony, in addition to the
Reagans and Plummer, were Wayne Smith of Bethesda, Md., and Dr.
Arthur L. Peterson of St. Petersburg, Fla., both directors of the
fund, and the Rev. James Farmer of Toms Creek Methodist Church.

<HEAD>Congressional Report Criticizes Justice Department As
Lackadaisical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department failed to keep up with
defense procurement fraud because it has a ``lackadaisical,
careless, hands-off management'' approach, two senators said in
releasing a critical congressional report Saturday.
   A Justice Department spokesman responded by saying congressional
critics should ``put their money where their mouths are.''
Spokesman Patrick Korten said the Government Accounting Office
report itself was ``lackadaisical.''
   The report by the GAO, the congressional watchdog agency, said
that the Justice Department doesn't know the status of many of its
Pentagon fraud investigations because it does a poor job of keeping
track of what its far-flung offices are doing.
   The GAO said that Attorney General Edwin Meese III should order
a number of administrative changes to do a better job of overseeing
investigations of the Defense Department.
   The study did not include any review of the current fraud and
bribery investigation of Pentagon weapons buying that became public
when search warrants were served June 14. The probe focuses on
allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of whom
are former military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting
details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of
dollars. No one has yet been charged.
   The GAO report was released by Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
   In a joint statement, they said, ``one of the most shocking
aspects of the (defense fraud) problem is that the law enforcement
system is incapable of adequately dealing with it.''
   ``The Justice Department's lackadaisical, careless, hands-off
management goes far to explain why the government is losing the war
against defense fraud,'' they said.
   ``If any major private law firm handled its affairs the way
Justice handles the defense fraud program, it would be out of
business within a year,'' they said.
   The GAO proposed a number of administrative steps to correct the
problem, including development of some type of recording and
tracking system and written management plans for effective us of
staff time.
   Korten suggested that if Grassley and Proxmire want the Justice
Department to gather statistics, they should push for more money
when its budget comes up for consideration. ``In short, put their
money where their mouths are,'' he said.
   ``It just doesn't add up. The fact of the matter is that we are
anything but lackadaisical in our prosecution of these cases, and
the current big case involving the Pentagon is a prime example. We
have had literally dozens of procurement fraud cases in recent
years. We have recovered tens of millions of dollars for the
taxpayers in these cases, and what they (GAO) choose to look at
instead is how much information we have in our computer in
Washington,'' Korten said.
   ``It seems to me to be an awfully _ just to use a phrase _
lackadaisical way of taking a look at how cases are prosecuted,''
he said.
   Korten said a staff turnover problem cited in the report is part
of larger pay scale problem in the federal government because of
low government salaries.
   Victoria Toensing, deputy assistant attorney general in the
criminal division, said U.S. attorney offices around the country
don't have enough staff to both prosecute and gather statistics.
   The GAO study reviewed 680 fraud allegations, involving charges
of bribery, corruption, conflict of interests, and antitrust
violations. They ranged from October 1983 through May 1987 and were
all cases that were referred to local U.S. attorneys for action.
   As of last September, the GAO said, no action had been taken on
286 of the referrals.
   ``The majority of the 286 pending referrals had been with the
Justice components for a year or more, and Justice does not know
whether these cases have been accepted, declined or are still
pending,'' the GAO said.
   The Justice Department didn't even know how many attorneys were
assigned to Pentagon fraud cases around the nation, the GAO said.
   The report said officials in most of the U.S. Attorney offices
agreed that there was a problem, and it was attributed to high
rates of turnover among both the lawyers and the clerical staff.
   The problem is the same in the Defense Procurement Fraud Unit, a
special Justice Department office set up to prosecute Pentagon
cases. That office has had a high rate of turnovers because its
lawyers can get higher salaries in private practice, the GAO noted.
Thus, the unit has a difficult time keeping experienced attorneys.

   Following is the text of President Reagan's
radio address, which he delivered Saturday from Camp David, Md.:
   My fellow Americans, this Fourth of July weekend, we Americans
will, as we do each year at this time, raise Old Glory a little
higher, cheer fireworks, and remember the blessing we share as
citizens of this great and free land. And as we celebrate our
independence and pause to give thanks for our liberty, let us also
remember that the freedoms we cherish are never more than a
generation away from extinction. It's up to each of us to preserve,
protect, and defend America's precious heritage.
   Some Americans have done just that in the battlefield. But all
of us can do it each and every day _ we can vote at election time,
we can volunteer to help political campaigns for the candidates of
our choice, as well as volunteer for work that's needed around our
community. And we can simply raise our children well, do our jobs
well, and live in God's light.
   One man who has contributed more than his share to our country
left government service this week. For a year-and-a-half, Howard
Baker has been my chief of staff here at the White House. He served
with great distinction helping me guide important legislation
through Congress, as well as helping me at the summits with Mr.
(Mikhail S.) Gorbachev in Washington and Moscow. Serving with
distinction is nothing new for Howard Baker. He did it for almost
two decades in the United States Senate and the last four years as
majority leader.
   I know I'll miss him around the White House. So, Howard, good
luck to you and your lovely wife, Joy.
   In the months ahead, I'll be helped by a new chief of staff,
Kenneth Duberstein. It won't be a big change for Ken. He's moving
from his old office where he's worked as the No. 2 man on my staff
and as Howard's partner since early last year, to the one next
door, and that's good because we won't have time just to settle in.
   Yes, we have a lot of work to do and a big agenda that we got
down to business on this week.
   On Friday, with members of Congress looking on, I signed the
Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act into law. At the ceremony, I
noted that almost a year-and-a-half ago, I had said we should
remove a financial specter facing our older Americans _ the fear of
an illness requiring acute care so expensive that it can result in
having to choose between bankruptcy and death. Shortly after that,
our administration submitted a bill to Congress to help free the
elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness. Now, a version of
that bill is law.
   As I said Friday, we still must face challenges if this law, as
Congress finally enacted it, is to work. But, we can all be
grateful that a burden has been lifted from the shoulders and minds
of the elderly all over America.
   By the way, as I signed the Catastrophic Coverage Act into law,
I couldn't help thinking how much we Americans have done in the
last few years. Today, our economy is strong and growing; our
belief in peace through strength, which we kept despite many
protests in Congress and elsewhere, is paying off; the first treaty
ever to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear
missiles has been signed; and there is all the way around a new
realism on our relations with the Soviet bloc.
   But despite these accomplishments, I believe our eyes should be
on the future and the accomplishments we have still to achieve. For
example, congressional approval of the free trade agreement that we
negotiated with Canada will help the entire North American economy
grow and create vast numbers of new jobs well into the next century.
   Throughout our history, whenever trade barriers had been lowered
in North America, we've had a blooming of economic growth. We owe
it to our children to cultivate for another time of flowering and
approve this agreement.
   We also owe it to our children to put the illegal drug trade out
of business. That's why when I visited Toronto recently for the
economic summit of the major industrial nations, I was particularly
pleased by one action the summit nations took. It's called the
``Bush Initiative.'' For it, thank Vice President (George) Bush and
Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Not long ago, these two
leaders decided that the best new place to hit the drug trade was
in its most vulnerable spot _ money-laundering. Now, that's what
all the major industrial nations are going to do.
   Yes, our nation's agenda is full. Whether it's keeping our
defenses strong or cutting unnecessary spending, getting Congress
to pass a welfare reform bill that requires work and trade
legislation that will open, not close, markets, or helping freedom
fighters around the world. But, that's what democracy is all about.
A big agenda _ America's agenda for all of us to work on together
to build a bright tomorrow for our blessed land. Here at the White
House, our sleeves are rolled up and we're hard at work on our
agenda for the future.
   So, happy Fourth of July. And until next week, thanks for
listening, and God bless you.

<HEAD>Danish Formula' Suggested for Ending ANZUS Nuclear Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say New Zealand may be able to
restore military cooperation with the United States with a formula
similar to that which keeps anti-nuclear Denmark in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The subject came up after both U.S. and Australian leaders
voiced regret here the past week at the absence of New Zealand from
the third straight annual ministerial meeting of ANZUS, the
military alliance formed by the three Pacific countries after World
War II.
   U.S.-New Zealand military ties deteriorated after Prime Minister
David Lange in 1985 barred a visiting U.S. warship under his new
Labor Party government's decision to close New Zealand territory to
nuclear-armed ships. The United States later read New Zealand out
of ANZUS in order to protect its policy of refusing to confirm or
deny whether any ship carries nuclear weapons.
   ``There must be a formula, if New Zealand would only look for
it, that would make it possible for them to come back into the
fold,'' U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz told reporters last
Wednesday after a two-day meeting with Australian leaders.
   Asked to elaborate on Shultz's remark, another high U.S.
official told reporters Friday, ``One formula they might look at, I
suppose, is the Danish formula.''
   Another State Department official described the Danish formula
as ``informing their allies by letter that Denmark does not permit
calls at their ports by ships armed with nuclear weapons and leave
it at that.''
   The U.S. officials spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Denmark and the United States have announced settlement of a
dispute similar to the U.S.-New Zealand controversy that erupted
when the Danish Parliament in April adopted a resolution requiring
the government to notify visiting warships of Denmark's 31-year-old
ban on nuclear weapons.
   After new, but inconclusive, elections waged partly on the
issue, Denmark's coalition prime minister, Poul Schlueter, told the
Parliament on June 7 that allied governments had been informed of
Denmark's general policy banning atomic weapons during peacetime,
and that in cases of specific ship visits foreign governments would
be told that Denmark assumes the visit is in compliance with Danish
rules.
   ``The government considers that this procedure respects both the
Danish non-nuclear policy and the views of our allies,'' Schlueter
said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said June 7 the United
States had noted the prime minister's statement and one by Danish
Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen that the formula ``respects
the policy of our allies neither to confirm nor to deny the
presence of nuclear weapons on their naval vessels.''
   U.S. officials have said a similar arrangement is used on U.S.
port visits to Norway.
   New Zealand has not recently suggested using the Danish formula
and it would be up to it to take the initiative on the matter, said
one of the State Department officials. Prime Minister Lange in the
past has likened New Zealand's nuclear ban to those of the
Scandinavian NATO allies.

<HEAD>With AM-Vatican-Lefebvre, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The following are excerpts of Pope John Paul
II's apostolic letter released Saturday, as translated from Italian
by The Associated Press:
   With great distress the church has observed the illegitimate
ordination of bishops performed June 30 by Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre, who made useless years of efforts to assure that the
priestly Fraternity of St. Pius X ... was in full communion with
the church. ...
   This act of disobedience _ which signifies the outright
rejection of the Roman primate _ constitutes a schismatic act. In
carrying out this act, despite the formal `monitum' (warning) sent
to them by the cardinal prefect of the Congregation for Bishops
last June 17, Monsignor Lefebvre and the priests Bernard Fellay,
Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de
Galarreta have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication as
foreseen under ecclesiastical discipline. ...
   The results of the movement promoted by Monsignor Lefebvre
should and ought to be the motive for all Catholics to reflect
sincerely on their own faithfulness to the tradition of the church.
...
   I would also like to call the attention of theologians and other
experts in ecclesiastical science, in order that these also feel
summoned by the present circumstances. In fact, the ... teachings
of the Second Vatican Council call for a renewed examination (of
the faith), which brings to light the Council's continuity with the
tradition (of the church), especially on those points of doctrine
which, perhaps because of their novelty, have not yet been
understood well by some sectors in the church. ...
   Under the present circumstances, I would like above all to
appeal solemnly and from the heart, in a fatherly and brotherly
way, to all those who have in some way been linked to the movement
of Archbishop Lefebvre, so that they understand the serious
obligation to remain united with the Vatican of Christ in the unity
of the Catholic Church, and not continue to aid that movement in in
any way. ...
   No one should ignore that formal adhesion to the schism
constitutes a grave offense to God and leads to excommunication
established by the right of the church. ...
   To all these Catholic faithful, who feel close to some older
liturgical forms and disciplines of the Latin tradition, I would
like to express my will ... to facilitate their spiritual unity
with the church, through the means necessary to guarantee respect
for their just aspirations. ...
   Keeping in mind the importance and complexity of the problems
referred to in this document, and in virtue of my apostolic
authority, I establish the following:
   a. The creation of a commission, with the responsibility of
working with the bishops, the departments of the Roman Curia and
interested groups to facilitate complete unification with the
church of the priests, seminarians, religious communities or
individuals that have been linked to the fraternity founded by
Monsignor Lefebvre and who would like to remain united to the
successor of Peter in the Catholic Church, preserving their
spiritual and liturgical traditions, in line with the protocol
signed last May 5 by Cardinal (Joseph) Ratzinger (head of the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) and Monsignor Lefebvre.
   b. This commission will have a cardinal as its president and be
composed of other members of the Roman Curia ...
   c. Moreover, the spirit of those who feel tied to the Latin
liturgical tradition must be respected, through a broad and
generous application of the directive ... allowing use of the Roman
Missal such the typical edition of 1962.

   Israeli police intercepted a drug pass Saturday
when a Lebanese man threw a bundle containing 2.2 pounds of heroin
across Israel's northern border to a waiting accomplice, a police
spokeswoman said.
   Police in the northern region of Galilee arrested the man on the
Israeli side of the border, the spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified, said the heroin
was worth ``hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' but she could not
specify the exact amount.
   ``Our detectives were scouting the area and they noticed a
Lebanese man throwing a package over the border,'' the spokewoman

   Israeli police have focused their attention on activity near the
border to try to stem the flow of drugs from Lebanon into Israel,
the spokeswoman said.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly on Saturday
rejected President Roh Tae-woo's choice for a new chief justice,
the first such refusal in the nation's history.
   It was also the first major test of power in the new,
opposition-controlled parliament. All past Assemblies have been
controlled by the governing party.
   The leadership of the governing Democratic Justice Party,
including its chairman Yoon Giel-joong and floor leader Kim
Yoon-hwan, offered to resign after the vote. The offer was rejected.
   In another vote, the one-house Assembly approved Roh's
nomination of a former lawyer as head of the government's Board of
Audit and Inspection, a Cabinet-level post.
   Roh's nomination of Chung Ki-sung as chief justice of South
Korea's highest court failed by a narrow margin. Chung received 141
votes, seven short of the majority required for approval. There
were 295 lawmakers present of the 299-member Assembly.
   Six voted against Chung while 134, mostly from the two major
opposition parties headed by Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam,
abstained in a coordinated anti-government gesture.
   Fourteen votes were determined to be invalid.
   It was the first serious political setback for Roh since he took
office on Feb. 25 with a narrow victory in December presidential
elections. Roh's government lost its parliamentary majority in
legislative elections in April.
   Chung, 60, was named a supreme court judge in 1986 after serving
various judicial posts for 29 years. Opponents considered him too
pro-government, and an anti-Chung campaign spread rapidly after his
nomination was announced Thursday.
   More than 300 lawyers and judge trainees signed statements
against the nomination. A Catholic activist group also voiced
objection.
   The Democratic Justice Party said it regretted the outcome of
Saturday's vote and called the opposition's mass absention
``undemocratic.'' Government officials said Roh would name a new
nominee soon.
   Kim Dae-jung's largest opposition grouping, the Party for Peace
and Democracy, termed the outcome ``fortunate'' and called on Roh
to nominate a chief justice who enjoys public confidence in his
ability to achieve judicial independence.
   Kim Young-sam's Reunification Democrtic Party hailed the vote as
``a great victory of our people.''
   The Korea Bar Association also welcomed the outcome and said the
new nominee should be selected from those who had not been
associated with past authoritarian governments.
   The outcome came as a surprise as the government party was
confident that it could muster enough votes with the help of a
conservative opposition group.
   Former Premier Kim Jong-pil's New Democratic Republican Party
had publicly endorsed Roh's nomination, but some of its 35
lawmakers voted against Chung.
   The top judiciary post has been vacant since June 17 when Kim
Yong-chul resigned under pressure from junior judges demanding
democratic reforms in the judiciary.
   Under the new constitution adopted last year, Kim needed
approval from the National Assembly to stay in the post. Hundreds
of judges demanded his resignation, criticizing him for his alleged
pro-government role in the past.
   The failure of Chung's nomination to pass parliament will strain
relations between the governing and opposition camps and will be
difficult for Roh to handle, according to political analysts.
   Also Saturday, the Assembly approved former lawyer Kim Young-jun
as the chief government auditor. The nomination was passed by
154-10, with 131 absentions and one invalid vote.

   The harmony between former Mayor Henry W. Maier
and his successor has hit a sour note.
   Maier canceled a July Fourth singing appearances with Mayor John
O. Norquist after tape recordings of their practice session were
released by Norquist to a radio station and The Milwaukee Journal.
   The former mayor, who retired in April after 28 years, said he
didn't expect the tapes to be released, and he was most upset by
the pokes taken at him in the Journal's story. The newspaper said
Maier had ``a voice-lesson operatic growl'' and Norquist sang with
``sober abandon.''
   ``This might be great fun for somebody, but I am a legitimate
vocalist,'' said Maier, who started the tradition of mayors singing
at parks on special occasions like the Fourth of July.
   ``In the 28 years I've been going to the parks, there was never
a comment on the singing,'' he said.
   Rosalind Rouse, an aide to Norquist, said the tape was released
with the mayor's permission.
   ``We don't believe there was any problem at all, and there's no
need to discuss it,'' Rouse said.

   Teamsters President Jackie Presser
remained hospitalized in serious condition Saturday at Lakewood
Hospital, where he was being treated for a blood clot in his lung.
   Presser, who suffers from brain cancer, was moved from the
cardiac care unit to a medical unit at the suburban Cleveland
hospital on Friday, a hospital spokesman said.
   Presser, 61, was hospitalized Tuesday after a blood clot reached
his lungs, making him dizzy and weak.
   Presser had a screen implanted in a vein below the kidneys
Thursday to block additional blood clots from moving to his lungs,
said Dr. James R. Bekeny, who performed the procedure. He said the
clot that reached Presser's right lung has stabilized and
eventually should dissolve.
   Presser has temporarily relinquished control of the 1.6
million-member union because of his health problems.

   Gary Hart's stolen car was found abandoned in a
shopping center parking lot, but police couldn't find the former
presidential candidate to return it.
   Hart's 1982 Pontiac Firebird was apparently abandoned in a
shopping center parking lot. A security guard at the University
Hills Plaza called police after noticing the windows were rolled
down and the steering column was damaged by someone who forced the
ignition lock, according to police reports.
   The guard notified police Friday night that the car was an
``obvious steal,'' said Denver Police Sgt. Milton Gras.
   In checking the car's Colorado license plates, investigating
officers found the vehicle was registered to Hart, who lives in
Kittredge, outside Denver.
   Police were unable to contact Hart so they towed the car to the
city's impoundment yard. It will be up to Hart to contact the pound
and retrieve the car, a dispatcher said Saturday.
   Police did not immediately know whether Hart had reported the
car stolen. A secretary who answered the telephone at Hart's law
office said he could not be reached.
   Hart withdrew from the Democratic presidential race for the
second time in March following a poor showing in early caucuses and
primaries.
   Hart, once the front-runner for his party's nomination, had
first abandoned his race 10 months earlier because of questions
about his relationship with Miami model Donna Rice.

   The wife of famed attorney Melvin Belli
says she wants to end their 16-year marriage and will seek a court
order barring her husband from their $6 million mansion.
   Lia Belli, 39, an unsuccessful state Senate candidate in 1984,
contends her 80-year-old husband beat her and falsely accused her
of having affairs with several celebrities.
   Belli was not available for comment, a spokesman in his office
said Friday. Belli was returning home after cutting short a tour of
the Soviet Union.
   Mrs. Belli, who told police Tuesday an armed intruder fired two
shots at her in her bedroom at 5 a.m., said she wants a legal
separation.
   ``When neither side is happy, the marriage should end quickly,''
she said. ``My heart is broken that throughout this whole thing he
still hasn't called me.''
   She said she believed a ``hit man'' was trying to kill her,
emphasizing she did not think her husband was behind the attack.

   Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt is
scheduled for a deposition later this month in a reverse
discrimination suit filed by nine white security guards who contend
they were fired because Flynt wanted an all-black security detail.
   The suit, filed in 1987 on behalf of the former guards by the
Equal Employment Opporunity Commission, seeks unspecified damages
including back pay. Hustler attorney David Kahn has argued that the
guards were fired because of poor work performance.
   On Friday, Flynt's lawyers asked attorneys from the EEOC to
testify about discussions commission attorneys had with the guards
and other witnesses. But EEOC attorney Daniel Preciado said he will
not divulge the conversations because of lawyer-client privilege.
   Flynt's deposition is set for July 13, Preciado said.

   As the Tawana Brawley case becomes ever more
complicated, the focus has shifted from the black teen-ager to her
three advisers and their racial politics. And the crucial question
_ What happened when she disappeared for four days last year? _ has
been obscured.
   Although she has maintained an almost complete public silence,
Tawana Brawley is famous. She has made the cover of People magazine
and was the subject of a ``Donahue'' program. Her picture is all
over the newspapers, whether she attends the theater on the arm of
an adviser or visits the church where her mother has sought
sanctuary.
   But the Brawley case has become less and less about Miss Brawley
and more and more about the tactics and motives of her publicist,
the Rev. Al Sharpton, and her lawyers, Alton Maddox and C. Vernon
Mason.
   Miss Brawley disappeared from her home in Wappingers Falls,
N.Y., for four days last November. She was found in a garbage bag,
her hair cut and her body smeared with excrement and marked with
racial slurs.
   She has said she was abducted and sexually molested by six white
men, one of whom had a badge, but questions have been raised about
her story, including suggestions that Miss Brawley was at a party
during part of the time she was missing.
   Her mother, Glenda Brawley, has said that the family initially
cooperated with authorities, but they stopped assisting after she
and the advisers felt that local and state officials were trying to
protect the guilty.
   The advisers say that the Tawana Brawley case illustrates how
the state's criminal justice system consistently discriminates
against blacks.
   The case has been unorthodox from the start, but in recent weeks
a series of bizarre developments has diverted attention from the
alleged victim to those around her.
   First, since the teen-ager would not talk, investigators
subpoenaed her mother to testify before a grand jury. Rather than
cooperate, she sought sanctuary in a church in Brooklyn's black
Bedford-Stuyvesant section.
   Sharpton challenged the special prosecutor, state Attorney
General Robert Abrams, to arrest her and ``show the nation the
moral beast you are.'' Abrams stayed put, and so did Glenda Brawley.
   That was when Sharpton aide Perry McKinnon defected. He charged
that Sharpton, Mason and Maddox, in fact, had no evidence that
would shed light on what happened to Miss Brawley, and that they
were using her case to fuel a political movement. He quoted
Sharpton as saying the case could make the advisers ``the biggest
niggers in New York.''
   McKinnon characterized the Brawley advisers' claim to evidence
of what really happened ``a pack of lies,'' and said, ``The Tawana
Brawley story may be that there is no Tawana Brawley story.''
   Sharpton counterattacked, denouncing McKinnon as a gofer who had
no access to the Brawleys or their advisers' deliberations.
Sharpton also described McKinnon as a killer (he was a soldier in
Vietnam), a psychopath (McKinnon received psychiatric treatment
after returning from Vietnam) and a bigamist (McKinnon did not
complete divorce proceedings to end his first marriage).
   A week later an unemployed former Navy technician, Samuel
McClease, claimed to have been promised $11,000 by Sharpton to bug
Mason's home and office and Sharpton's home in order to protect
Sharpton if the case began to unravel.
   McClease told WCBS-TV he had tapes that substantiated his
allegations, which generally supported McKinnon's.
   Polls showed that New Yorkers, including an overwhelming share
of whites and a majority of blacks, believed that Glenda Brawley
and her advisers had not handled the case responsibly, and that the
latter were lying.
   But then came another jolt _ the FBI said the tapes McClease
produced were blank and appeared never to have been used, and
charged McClease with obstruction of justice and perjury.
   Investigators who thought they had seen everything rolled their
eyes and shook their heads. R. Scott Greathead, first assistant
state attorney general, was more restrained than most, calling the
blank tapes ``another unexpected development in a case that has
been full of many surprising twists and turns.''
   Sharpton was jubilant. ``We are coming to get our deed papers,''
he said, referring to what he said would be a $100 million libel
suit against WCBS. ``We gonna go see what color curtains we want in
our new building.''
   But the flamboyant preacher also had reason for concern: he
reportedly was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service
for not filing tax returns.
   At the end of the week a standoff again seemed to have been
reached, with both sides overwhelmed by the absurdity and
unexpectedness of developments.
   It was left for Gov. Mario Cuomo to state the obvious: The case
will be resolved only if ``Tawana Brawley or her mother would
speak. ... Just tell us what happened.''

<HEAD>Saxaphone-Tooting Monarch Celebrates 42-Year Reign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wail of conch shells and the
chanting of monks opened a celebration honoring Bhumibol Adulyadej,
the hugely popular king who on Saturday became the longest-reigning
monarch in Thailand's 750-year history.
   The king's 42 years and 23 days on the throne eclipsed the
tenure of King Chulalongkorn, a visionary monarch who ruled from
1868 to 1910, when Thailand still was an absolute monarchy.
   The king and Queen Sirikit lit candles and incense sticks before
the ashes of King Chulalongkorn to begin the four days of religious
and royal celebrations. Monks chanted and conch shells sounded
during the ceremony.
   The king on Friday signed a decree to free or reduce the
sentences of about 50,000 prisoners charged with minor crimes. Such
royal amnesties are issued periodically to mark special occasions.
   The ceremonies in the Grand Palace _ a walled compound of
glittering spirals and imposing structures _ opened with the
presentation of special ``prayer fans'' to 44 senior Buddhist monks.
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, Cabinet ministers and senior
military officers were at the palace for the rites along with
members of the royal family.
   Bangkok buildings have been festooned with lights and
decorations for several days and a display of 29,999 fireworks is
planned. King Bhumibol is the ninth monarch of the current Chakri
dynasty and nine is generally considered an auspicious number by
Thais.
   Public festivities, including movies, concerts and folk dances,
have been scheduled throughout the country.
   The royal family is also to visit Ayuthaya, where they will pay
respects to the spirits of kingly ancestors of the old capital,
which was sacked by the Burmese in 1767.
   The royal seat subsequently was moved to Bangkok, where the
Chakri dynasty was founded in 1782 by Rama I.
   Rama IV, popularized in the West in the book and movie ``The
King and I,'' began changing traditional concepts of absolute rule
and introduced Western know-how to the country. Rama V reorganized
the state machinery, opened Thailand to further Western influence
but adroitly kept colonial powers at bay.
   Bhumibol, who turned 60 in December during another nationwide
celebration, was born in Boston, where his father studied medicine.
   The Swiss-educated prince assumed the throne upon the
still-mysterious death of his brother in 1946. He gradually
restored some of the power and prestige the monarchy lost in 1932
when a bloodless revolution ended its absolute rule.
   The king and his wife were a hit during a series of world tours
in the 1960s. The multi-talented monarch frequently shed his normal
seriousness to pick up a saxaphone and join in jazz jam sessions.
   In the 1970s and 80s, he and members of his family turned their
attention to the country's rural poor, initiating a network of
royal projects in irrigation, reforestation, agriculture and the
replacement of opium by other cash crops.
   The king would spend up to nine months of each year in the
countryside, away from the opulent palaces and elaborate ceremonies
in Bangkok.
   The king has stepped in on several occasions of national crisis,
including a 1973 student revolt against a trio of military
strongmen. The bloodshed was stopped and the trio exiled. He is
widely believed to wield considerable behind-the-scenes power and
is looked upon by Thais as a factor of stability in a modern
history punctuated by frequent military coups and factionalism.

   A man who killed a woman with a barbecue
fork and then set her house on fire while her four children were
sleeping has been sentenced to 85 years in prison.
   Douglas Johnson, 34, was convicted of murder and first-degree
arson in the slaying of Kelly Meyer, 28, on March 7, 1987. He was
also found guilty of sixth-degree larceny for stealing Meyer's
purse.
   Her children were rescued from the blaze.
   Superior Court Judge William L. Hadden Jr. on Friday ordered
Johnson to serve consecutive sentences of life in prison for murder
plus 25 years for arson and three months for larceny, the maximum
sentence possible. Life is defined as 60 years under state law.
   Meyer's body was discovered in the burning home. She had been
stabbed more than 60 times.
   Johnson was the last person seen with Meyer the night she was
killed. He has an extensive history of assaults and rapes against
women, police said.

   Here is the text of Sen. Robert Byrd's
response to President Reagan's weekly radio address broadcast
Saturday:
   Good afternoon. This is Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia.
   This Monday is the Fourth of July. For most Americans, the
Fourth of July is a day to spend with family and friends. We hold
picnics, go to the beach, march in parades, and look forward to
fireworks at night. We celebrate our freedom. It is a good day to
be an American. We share our love of country around the barbecue
pit and the picnic table.
   We take stock of nation's prosperity between innings during the
annual softball game. We see the future in the delight of our
children as they watch the fireworks light up the sky. It is a day
of quite patriotism, reaffirmation, and thankfulness.
   We thank God for our good fortune that we are Americans. We
reaffirm our commitment to the legacy given to us by our
forbearers. We pray for those Americans upon whom misfortune has
fallen.
   But, this Fourth is a little different. It is different because
this year we must choose a new path for America. This is an
election year; we're about to choose a new president.
   And on this Fourth of July, it is a time for reflection as well
as celebration. It is a time to remember what has made America
great and to use those traditional strengths as we contemplate the
future. Our nation has unfinished business.
   Our foreign competition is still beating us at our own game.
   Our children are not getting the education they deserve. The
American dream of owning a home seems to be almost out of reach for
the next generation. Drug dealers flood the market with dope and
death. The American family, the bedrock of our nation's foundation,
is changing and needs new policies to preserve it.
   What is most disturbing is the erosion of the public trust.
   Wall Street has been rocked by scandal. Our national security is
being endangered by greed. Honesty and integrity seem to be in
short supply. For some Americans, those may seem to be reasons
enough to turn away from politics, from making a choice about the
future. ``Nothing is ever going to change,'' they say. Throwing up
their hands in despair, ``Why vote at all?''
   But, if this had been the attitude of Thomas Jefferson and the
other great founders of our nation on the first Fourth of July,
where would we be today? Let us reject the cynicism that says that
things cannot be improved.
   You, the people, have the power to change things and to let
those in high places know what you expect. America has unfinished
business.
   America was not founded on cynicism. It was founded on hope by
strong people who built a new country by making new choices however
difficult. America was built on love of country, belief in the
common man, hard and honest work, optimism and religious faith. It
is your government, and it can reflect your values. And it can help
to solve America's problem, but you have to participate.
   America can deal with its drug problem. American can educate our
children better. American can adapt to the changing needs of the
family. America can meet our security commitments without busting
the national budget. America can meet our energy needs. America can
protect the environment. And America can demand a fair deal from
our trading partners overseas. Americans want a restoration of
integrity and common decency. Those are values that we all share
and understand.
   I come from West Virginia, the state where patriotism and family
are cherished traditions. I know most other Americans are like that
too. I have great faith in this country. When we Americans put our
minds to it, we can solve our problems. And Americans are always
willing to imagine something new and better for their country.
Americans are optimists.
   This Fourth of July then, let us remember our strengths, our
heritage, and our power to determine our own fate. We can give
America a new beginning. Celebrate your freedom in the most
meaningful way this year. Participate. Exercise that most
important, uniquely American privilege; register and vote. Get
involved.

   The producer of the hit film ``Dirty
Dancing'' is suing a film production group that made an X-rated
videotape titled ``Very Dirty Dancing.''
   Caballero Control Corp. and Caballero Home Video are engaged in
trademark infringement and unfair competition, Vestron Inc.
attorney Henry Ben-Zvi said in the lawsuit filed in federal court
here Friday.
   Advertising describes ``Very Dirty Dancing'' as a story where
``It doesn't get any dirtier.''
   The suit also claims that the name ``Very Dirty Dancing'' would
cause consumer confusion with a ``Dirty Dancing'' sequel and the
current ``More Dirty Dancing'' record album.
   Vestron is seeking to ban release of Caballero's videotape and
asked that all copies that have been distributed be handed over to
Vestron, Ben-Zvi said.
   Caballero officials could not be reached for comment because
there is no listed telephone number for the companies.
   ``Dirty Dancing,'' a coming of age story about a sheltered,
wealthy girl and a poor resort dance instructor who fall in love
has earned $60 million since it was released in August 1987.

<TEXT>
   Chinese reformists watched with keen interest as
members of the Soviet Communist Party openly wrangled over economic
and political change last week, but they were reluctant to draw
parallels to their own experience.
   Indirectly, the Chinese have a stake in Soviet reform because it
reflects their own efforts to modernize their country. Successful
Soviet reforms could persuade foot-dragging Chinese conservatives
to emulate their communist neighbor.
   But for practical and historical reasons, Chinese comment on
last week's concluded Soviet party conference has been impersonal.
   ``We are following the developments ... And we hope that the
reform in the Soviet Union will be a success,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Li Zhaoxing said politely, when pressed to comment.
   The official Xinhua News Agency, which called the conference
crucial to the Soviets' domestic situation, reported the opening
and closing of the proceedings as flashes _ the most urgent kind of
news bulletin. But it did not comment on the possible impact of the
conference on China's reforms or on Sino- Soviet relations.
   Soviet parallels to China's experience are obvious.
   Both countries want to revitalize economies grown stagnant under
central planning, and both see the solution in reducing central
planning and encouraging input from the long-forgotten individual
citizen.
   Just eight months ago, China's Communist Party held a landmark
national congress at which it retired aging conservatives and
pledged to move ahead full speed in separating party and government
functions and streamlining the bureaucracy.
   Chinese newspaper readers this spring were treated to
unprecedented open debate among legislators on problems such as
corruption and the need for democracy, much as Soviet readers were
last week.
   If one substitutes ``kaifang'' for ``glasnost,'' and ``gaige''
for ``perestroika,'' Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's appeals for
openness and restructuring echo speeches made by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping over the past decade.
   But emphasizing the similarities between their policies could be
dangerous for Deng.
   While Soviet success would bolster his cause, Soviet failure
would give Chinese conservatives a powerful argument for halting
change.
   Chinese analysts believe failure is a real possibility. Tang
Xiuzhe, a commentator for the Xinhua agency, emphasized ``big
hurdles'' the Soviets face, including changing the thought and
behavior patterns of countless bureaucrats.
   Western observers say reform could be tougher in the Soviet
Union than in China because central planning has been in place a
generation longer, and there are fewer people around with a memory
of how private markets work.
   In addition, China does not follow the philosophy that all
communist countries should follow common domestic policies.
   Although China started its economic reforms in 1978 and could
claim to play ``big brother'' to the Soviets, it maintains a
detached attitude. One of the factors in the bitter Sino-Soviet
split of the early 1960s was Moscow's insistence that what was good
for the Soviets was good for the Chinese.
   Deng frequently tells other socialist leaders _ most recently
the visiting Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam _ that
nations must conduct reform according to their own conditions.
   Official detachment aside, Xinhua's detailed coverage of the
Soviet conference showed the keenness of Chinese interest.
   The news agency carried detailed reports of each day's debates
and interviews with Soviet citizens saying they want change.
   Xinhua also gave lengthy reports of former Moscow party chief
Boris Yeltsin's open challenge of party authority, a sensitive area
in Chinese politics.
   China has its own case of a high official dismissed for
offending conservatives. Hu Yaobang was ousted last year after
failing to speedily crack down on student pro-democracy
demonstrations. Hu, like Yeltsin, sinned by being too far ahead of
his fellow reformers.
   But in allowing Yeltsin to make his plea before such a large
open gathering, the Soviets showed they are far ahead of the
Chinese in the ``kaifang,'' or ``glasnost,'' aspect of reform.
China still keeps its party squabbles private.

<TEXT>
   When Doug La Follette tossed his hat in the
ring for the U.S. Senate, some people wondered why the hat was so
big.
   La Follette, Wisconsin's secretary of state, wears a gray
Australian bush hat almost everywhere he goes. The reason is, he
has the same mild form of skin cancer as President Reagan.
   His wide-brimmed hat is a slight political liability, but also a
potential trademark and a tool for educating people about the
hazards of excessive exposure to the sun, La Follette said.
   ``I don't wear a hat out of a quirk, I wear a hat for very
realistic health reasons,'' La Follette, 48, said during a campaign
visit at a recent farmers market on Capitol Square. ``I've learned
that the sun can be harmful.''
   La Follette is one of five Democrats and two Republicans vying
to succeed retiring Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.
   ``It's very sobering, realizing being brown is not as beautiful
as you think it is,'' said La Follette, who was diagnosed three
years ago as having basal cell carcinoma, the most common and least
dangerous form of skin cancer.
   Nationally, an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people are diagnosed
each year as having the easily treated form of cancer. It is not
even counted in official cancer statistics, but still could be
fatal if untreated.
   La Follette's case was diagnosed when what he thought was a
pimple turned out to be a pre-cancerous spot on his skin. Since
then, he has gone in for a checkup every six months.
   His physician, Dr. Stephen Snow, of the University of Wisconsin
Medical School, said skin cancer accounts for more than one-third
of all cancer cases, and as many skin cancers are diagnosed
annually as cancers of the lung, breast, colon and prostate
combined.
   ``It's all related to sunlight,'' Snow said. ``It's a totally
preventable problem, but since when has the average person ever
been rational?''
   Dr. Derek Cripps, also of the University of Wisconsin,
recommends that everyone wear sun screen with a protection factor
of 15 or higher; La Follette wears sun screen rated 32 as well as
his wide-brimmed hat.
   Wearing a hat puts off some people, La Follette said.
   ``You can't be a hermit; the hat is my solution,'' La Follette
said. ``The big brim is important because it keeps the sun off my
nose and ears.''

<HEAD>Party to Review Credentials of Its 20 Million Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party will review the qualifications
of each of its 20 million members before the end of the year, a
move that could help strengthen Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political
base.
   Gorbachev directed that the examination of party members be
conducted in the open and not ``through discussion behind the
scenes,'' the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda said
Saturday.
   The four-day Communist Party conference that ended Friday
approved a call for reevaluating party membership as well as
backing Gorbachev's program for a stronger legislature, presidency
and a 10-year limit on the terms of party and government officials.
   Pravda said the conference considered it necessary ``to carry
out this year a ... campaign in party organizations, governed by
the decisions of the conference about reform of the political
system, democratization of party life.''
   Such a reevaluation of party membership could become a
widespread effort to force opponents of Gorbachev's reforms out of
the party, but it is more likely to be targeted against the idle
and corrupt.
   ``Not a single honest man should be left outside perestroika,''
Gorbachev said in his speech opening the conference Tuesday.
   But the Communist Party chief also has said that the criterion
for judging party members is their attitude toward his reform
effort. A limited housecleaning could be expected to strengthen
Gorbachev by eliminating some of the most intransigent opponents of
reform and improving the party's effectiveness.
   And it could improve the image of the party, which the
policy-making Central Committee criticized before the conference as
having a bureaucratic stranglehold on the economy and government.
   Communists must go through a lengthy selection process and
ideological training before being granted membership in the party,
a prerequisite for advancement to positions of responsibility in
Soviet society. About one of 10 Soviet adults is a member of the
party.
   Although conference delegates backed the review of the
membership roll, it is unlikely they would have gone along with a
widespread campaign against conservatives.
   Many of the speeches to the conference struck a tone
considerably more conservative than Gorbachev's, and the official
press said before the conference that mid-level party officials had
rammed through slates of delegates despite Gorbachev's call for an
open, democratic election procedure.
   The resolution calling for the review of party membership also
called for a a division of power between the party apparatus and
local governing councils, or soviets.
   Gorbachev proposed at the conference to get the party out of
day-to-day management of affairs and leave that to responsible
government officials and plant managers.
   The resolution was the only one of seven from the party
conference published by the Soviet press Saturday, and it was
uncertain when the rest of the resolutions would be released.
   The conference of 5,000 Communists from around the country,
called to review progress on Gorbachev's reforms and chart a course
for the future, acted on the party review at the urging of the
Central Committee and Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev has told party bureaucrats they must either get behind
him or get out of the way.
   But he said the party still must give its members a chance.
   ``Many of these who only recently were regarded inactive and had
lost contact with the party branch, who had been regarded as dead
wood, are now trying to find their place in life,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``The very certification process should be a school of educating
Communists,'' Gorbachev added.

   At least eight people were killed and 28

northern Uttar Pradesh state, the Press Trust of India said
Saturday.
   The news agency said one person was killed and eight injured in
clashes between rival groups in Agra district, 112 miles south of
New Delhi, during the elections on Friday.
   Some of the injured suffered gunshot wounds, it said.
   The agency said four people were killed and 20 injured in
fighting in Muzzafarnagar district, north of New Delhi, and three
deaths were reported from other areas in the state.
   More than 25,000 villages voted in elections to the councils on
Friday, and another round of polling is scheduled Tuesday.
   Candidates are not formally affiliated with political parties
but are supported by various political groups.
   Press Trust said more than 65 people were arrested in connection
with the violence.

<HEAD>US Warship Docks After Anti-Nuclear Action Halted by Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy destroyer Conyngham
docked in a Danish port Saturday after police towed away a
Greenpeace ship that had blocked the harbor entrance in an
anti-nuclear protest.
   Police arrested 14 members of the environmental organization
after some protesters tried to climb the cables of the Conyngham
and four others jumped into the water to stop the warship from
docking.
   Police on rubber dinghies boarded the Greenpeace ship Moby Dick
and towed it from the harbor. The Moby Dick had blocked the port of
Aalborg to demand guarantees from the destroyer's captain that the
4,500-ton warship did not carry nuclear arms.
   Activists surrounding the Conyngham in rubber boats started to
climb in its cables but were forced down by water sprayed from
hoses. The destroyer had been waiting at anchor since early morning
in the fiord outside the city in northern Jutland.
   In a final effort to stop the boat from docking, four activists
undressed and jumped into the water, but they were removed by
police.
   Earlier Saturday, Greenpeace tried to deliver a letter to the
ship's captain, but it fell into the water. Signed by Social
Democratic leader Svend Auken and others, the letter was a reminder
of Denmark's non-nuclear policy.
   The visit was the first by an American warship since the
government decided in June that visiting warships did not have to
notify Denmark if they carried nuclear weapons.
   The opposition Social Democrats had demanded that visiting
warships adhere to Denmark's non-nuclear policy, and the issue
forced elections May 10.
   The United States and Britain said the Social Democrats'
proposal, if implemented, would have threatened NATO solidarity and
violated their policies, which forbid disclosure of which ships
carry nuclear arms.
   Greenpeace claims the American destroyer was inspected and
authorized to carry and launch nuclear arms as late as January 1987.

   Johann Baptist Gradl, a former federal government
minister and respected West Berlin politician, died following a
long illness, city officials said Saturday. Gradl was 84.
   Gradl, who died late Friday night, helped found Berlin's
Christian Democratic Union party in 1945.
   He fled the Soviet-controlled sector of the divided city into
West Berlin two years later, after disagreements with communist
authorities.
   Gradl was a member of the West German parliament, the Bundestag,
from 1957 to 1980, representing West Berlin.
   He also served as the federal minister for German exiles in
1965-66.
   From 1969 to 1972, he was chairman of the Bundestag Committee
for German-German Relations.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Saturday said Gradl had
``devoted his life to German reunification.''

<HEAD>Virginia Hay Arrives In Western Ohio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLDWATER, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trucks carrying some 2,000 bales of
donated hay for drought-stricken farmers arrived here Saturday as
Virginia farmers returned a favor granted by their Ohio
counterparts during a drought two years ago.
   Four trucks rolled into this Mercer County village in western
Ohio shortly before noon and about 50 farmers who were involved in
the 1986 haylift to Virginia lined up for free hay.
   Each farmer received 40 bales, or about enough to feed an
average Mercer County herd of cows for one day. Virgil Dues, who
operates a farm with about 200 head of cattle, was the first farmer
to get his hay.
   ``One bale is good, two bales is better,'' Dues said. ``We're
going day-by-day. There is nothing we can do about (the drought)
right now.''
   Ralph Heyne, who operates a nearby cattle farm, said he donated
about 1,500 bales to Virginia farmers in 1986 when the Southeast
suffered a pasture-killing drought and farmers across the nation
shipped donated hay by the trainload.
   ``At the time, I had a lot of hay in my barn and I thought it
was the thing to do,'' said Heyne, who has about 350 head of
cattle. ``It was an easy thing to do when my barn was full. I wish
we were sending it down this time.''
   Heyne said Ohio farmers were becoming more worried as the
Midwest drought continues.
   ``Fuses are a little shorter around here than usual,'' he said.
``It's a little harder to keep a smile on your face.''
   After the hay arrived, Lt. Gov. Paul Leonard spoke by telephone
to haylift organizer Eugene Morris, a U.S. Department of
Agriculture soil specialist from Charlotte Court House, Va.
   ``We want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We're
at the point where every little bit helps. This is a good start,
Mr. Morris,'' Leonard said.
   ``We expect this to be the beginning of a good thing. It shows
that in any time of crisis we can depend on one another,'' Leonard
said. ``Ohioans have never been so selfish that they wouldn't help
others in their time of need. And they've never been so proud that
they would not accept help in their own time of need.''
   Morris told Leonard and the farmers that he was trying to
organize another haylift. Mercer County Extension Agent Nick
Freeman said most local farmers would run out of hay before fall if
the drought does not end soon.
   ``They've had to (sell) a lot of cattle by now,'' Freeman said.
``At the market, it's a sad scene to watch farmers bring in cows
they don't want to sell. It's having an emotional impact on the
community.''
   The trucks, donated by the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., left
Charlotte County, Va., Friday. Goodyear also provided drivers and
paid transportation costs.
   Another haylift reached Cloverdale, Ind., on Friday with bales
of hay donated by South Carolina farmers and trucked in by
volunteer off-duty Charleston, S.C., cops. ``Our hay yield is down
and what we're using now is what should be used next winter,''
farmer Ed Meek said.
   Haylifts also are operating elsewhere across the nation.
   Fifteen railroad cars of hay are being provided by ``Feed the
Children,'' a hunger relief agency in Oklahoma, to farmers in South
Dakota, with the first load arriving at Aberdeen in two weeks. The
Burlington Northern Railroad is providing free transportation.

   Most Fourth of July fireworks have been
banned in Wisconsin because the drought has raised the risk of
fire, but nature may provide its own display of colors and lights,
an entomologist says.
   Fireflies and glowworms might help brighten the holiday
festivities across Wisconsin.
   ``There'll be a little bit of natural fireworks this weekend,''
said Phillip Pelliteri Jr., an entomologist with the University of
Wisconsin Extension in Madison.
   The firefly population has been down the last three years but
has increased recently with a population growth of glowworms the
last three weeks, he said. Glowworms are the larval stage of
fireflies.
   The fireflies may also be an asset for holiday celebrations
because they feed on pesky insects.
   Pellitteri said wasp and mosquito populations are also down and
``it's one of the few blessings of the drought.''

   Nineteen-year-old Steffi Graf defeated
eight-time Wimbledon winner Martina Navratilova on Saturday to
capture her first Wimbledon crown and continue her domination of
women's tennis this year.
   The West German's 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 victory at the All England
Tennis Championships stopped Navratilova from winning a record nine
singles titles on the famed grass courts.
   Graf's win follows victories at two earlier Grand Slam events
this year, the Australian and French Opens. If she takes the U.S.
Open in September, she will become the first person in 18 years to
sweep the Grand Slam circuit in the same year.
   Graf, who took over the No. 1 ranking in the world from
Navratilova last August, became the youngest Wimbledon women's
champion since 17-year-old American Maureen Connelly won in 1952.
She is the first German woman to win since Cilly Aussem in 1931.
   American Navratilova, 31, did not lose without a fight, winning
six games in a row to wrap up the first set and taking a 2-0 lead
in the second. But then Graf used her stinging forehand and
devastating speed to take the final two sets.
   West Germany's Boris Becker and Sweden's Stefan Edberg meet
Sunday in the men's final.

<HEAD>Lockheed Negotiating To Sell Planes To Ethiopia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lockheed Corp. is negotiating the sale of
L-100 transport planes to Ethiopia, and the Red Cross is worried
that the hunger-plagued nation could use the planes for military
purposes.
   Joseph E. Dabney, a Lockheed spokesman in nearby Marietta, where
the plane is manufactured, confirmed the company's negotiations
with government-owned Ethiopian Airlines.
   ``We understand that they plan to open up an African cargo
operation to airlift perishables such as fruits and vegetables from
Africa to Europe, then haul consumer goods from Europe back to
Africa,'' he was quoted as saying in Sunday's Atlanta Journal and
Atlanta Constitution.
   Dabney said Ethiopia is trying to buy at least two L-100s _ the
civilian version of the C-130, a four-engine plane widely used by
the U.S. Air Force.
   Two weeks ago, U.S. officials said L-100s would not be sold to
Angola because that country's Marxist government has used the plane
for military purposes.
   Some worry that Ethiopia's Marxist government might do the same
thing. Ethiopia has been criticized for blocking relief efforts in
rebellious areas.
   ``Any of these planes are very versatile and could certainly be
used to transport troops or artillery or other supplies,'' said
Jean-Jacques Surbeck, information officer of the International
Committee of the Red Cross in New York. The Red Cross was expelled
from Ethiopia in May.
   The newspaper said Ethiopian officials in Washington and New
York would not confirm the negotiations with Lockheed.

   The Canadian Search and Rescue
Coordination Center found the Solution this week _ three times.
   The Solution, a fishing boat, was put back on course twice when
it reported itself lost, said Canadian Coast Guard spokesman
William Frowd.
   But the third time, the vessel was towed into port.
   The saga began Wednesday, when the Solution's captain radioed
that he was lost on a trip from Cape Scott to Hakai Passage, north
of Vancouver Island.
   An aircraft went to the area along with another fishing vessel
and helped the Solution get back on the course, but Thursday
morning search and rescue officials got another call.
   This time, a Canadian Forces tracker plane used directional
equipment to find the Solution. The boat's captain decided to head
for Port Hardy on the northeastern tip of Vancouver Island, and was
helped to get on that course.
   But 4{ hours later, yet another call came in.
   The Solution eventually was found, again, by another fishing
vessel, about 20 miles from where it was during the preceding call.
   The vessel was then taken in tow by another boat to Hartley Bay.
   Coast Guard Cpl. Randy Young said Friday that the vessel
appeared to have problems with equipment that wasn't working, an
oil leak that caused the engine to break down and a depth sounder
that did not work.
   Young said he hoped the Royal Canadian Mounted Police would
``have a chat'' with the Solution's captain.
   ``We've got a line on her now,'' said Frowd. ``There's no way
she can get lost.''

<HEAD>Conference Apparently Did Not Resolve Crucial Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first Communist Party conference in 47 years
ended with the biggest overhaul of the Soviet political system
since the 1920s, but it did not resolve the issues that touched off
the most heated debate.
   Fiery oratory came from workers on the problems of food
shortages, pollution and the privileges of the elite. Party members
clashed over the new openness of the Soviet press.
   With each day of the four-day conference, discussion became more
impassioned, building to the spectacle Friday of a Politburo member
and his ousted rival dueling before the 5,000 delegates and an
audience of millions on national television.
   Introducing the most radical overhaul of the political system
since the days of Josef Stalin, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
on Tuesday embarked on a discussion of his reforms in a 3{-hour
keynote address.
   He proposed to have the Communist Party officials at every level
stand for election. This will mean Gorbachev will be eligible to
seek a new, strengthened presidency to be elected by the 2,250
members of a representative body to be known as the Congress of
People's Deputies. The congress would be elected every five years
and meet once a year.
   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, a close Gorbachev ally,
said Communists will lose their party posts if they fail to win
elections as heads of soviets, or governing councils, in secret
ballots of the deputies.
   According to ousted Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, the
proposal on the soviets was ``so unexpected'' that many delegates
did not understand it.
   Even Gorbachev admitted there was ``a certain lack of
understanding'' for the proposal when he took the floor for a
second time on Thursday with a passionate appeal for political
reform.
   Delegates endorsed the proposal on elections with 209 dissenting
votes, in spite of a party tradition of uniting behind the
leadership when a vote is taken. The resolution was the only one of
seven adopted by the conference that was published the day after
the proceedings ended late Friday.
   Resolutions on Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness,
on ethnic questions, legal reform, economic restructuring and
fighting bureaucracy still were unpublished late Saturday.
   Opposition to ``glasnost'' became evident during the conference
debate, as delegates shouted down liberal editors Ivan Laptiev of
Izvestia and Grigory Baklanov of the literary monthly Znamya. On
Wednesday, Russian writer Yuri Bondarev charged the reformist press
``destroys, humiliates and flushes down the toilet our past and our
sacred national values.' '
   Intervening frequently in the debate, Gorbachev repeatedly
reminded delegates that ``we are learning democracy'' and
encouraged them to let speakers have their say.
   In addition to Yeltsin, others ventured into territory that for
years has been off limits to criticism _ a steelworker from the
Urals, a Siberian party official and a delegate from a Moscow
aerodynamics institute, who demanded that Yeltsin address the
conference.
   Three years after Gorbachev began his reforms, steelworker
Veniamin A. Yarin said workers see no results.
   Talking about industrial pollution in his city in the Urals,
Yarin harangued the government for failing to take action and
demanded measures in the 60 most polluted Soviet cities to stop
this ``Chernobyl-like catastrophe.''
   Yeltsin noted that ``we are all proud of socialism ... but in 70
years we have not resolved the most important problems: how to feed
and clothe the people, provide services and decide social
questions.''
   Yeltsin, who as a former non-voting member of the ruling
Politburo has had access to the special stores, limousines and food
deliveries reserved for top party officials, called for abolition
of special privileges.
   Yeltsin also requested regular reports on Communist Party
finances, saying that as head of the party in Moscow and earlier in
the Urals city of Sverdlovsk, he knew the party raked in ``millions
of rubles'' in members' fees, but saw the results only ``in dachas
so luxurious that it's embarrassing when people visit from other
(foreign) parties.''
   Gorbachev told conference delegates in a casual chat televised
Thursday that ``we should take a look'' at party privileges because
there are so many popular complaints about them.
   But Kremlin No. 2 Yegor K. Ligachev criticized Yeltsin and polls
on public attitudes toward party privileges published in the
reformist weekly Moscow News. The newspaper said that of 548
Muscovites asked, 84 percent disapproved of special food deliveries
to certain officials.
   Ligachev said ``official figures'' should be published but
defended such privileges by stressing how hard party leaders work.
   He also defended party stalwarts Andrei A. Gromyko and Mikhail
S. Solomentsev as supporters of Gorbachev. A delegate said Thursday
that the two officials and others who carried out the
now-discredited policies of former premier Leonid I. Brezhnev can't
properly serve under Gorbachev.
   Yeltsin, too, lashed out at unnamed officials who came to power
in the Brezhnev era, saying they should be dismissed after giving a
public explanation of why they supported policies that led the
country to a crisis.
   He also attacked Solomentsev by name, accusing the head of the
party's chief disciplinary body of failing to call to account
``people who took bribes in the millions.''

   Israeli troops clashed with Arab youths in at
least seven towns and refugee camps in the occupied territories
Saturday. Hospital officials and radio reports said a 17-year-old
Palestinian was killed.
   An army spokeswoman denied the youth was shot by soldiers and
said troops used only tear gas and rubber bullets to break up the
protests.
   The death brings the number of Palestinians killed to 215 since
an uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories began
Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have been slain.
   Police also fired tear gas to disperse Palestinian youths
blocking a road in the Arab town of Shufat, outside Jerusalem,
police spokesman Rafi Levy said.
   The army said two unidentified tourists were wounded slightly
when a bus was stoned in the biblical city of Bethlehem.
   In the Gaza Strip, attackers hurled a firebomb at a military
patrol in Gaza City and residents in nearby Nusseirat showered a
patrol with rocks, the army said. It said one soldier was injured
by a rock.
   Also Saturday, Israeli television reported that military
prosecutors have charged an Israeli soldier with manslaughter in
the slaying of a Palestinian youth. The report said the
unidentified soldier shot a rubber bullet at a Ramallah boy's face
and killed him four months ago. It did not elaborate.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, Nael Yousef Muhamad Hamaisi died
of a gunshot wound in the head after a demonstration by students
erupted into a stone-throwing clash with soldiers, Israel radio and
hospital officials said.
   The military spokeswoman said the army was investigating reports
of a body brought to Jenin Hospital, but she said soldiers did not
use live ammunition in Jenin.
   Hospital officials also reported a youth was shot in the leg in
Qalandya, north of Jerusalem, and that a man was hit with a bullet
in the hand in Nablus.
   But army spokesmen said they were unaware of either those
clashes or the injuries. The military spokesmen and hospital
officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Soldiers dispersed protesters in three other villages and two
refugee camps in the West Bank, and curfews were imposed on Jenin,
Kalkilya and the Jelazoun refugee camp, the military said.
   Hundreds of villagers took part in the clash with soldiers in
Kalkilya after troops entered a school, Arab reports said.
   In southern Israel, about 50 Israeli writers and artists staged
a demonstration near the Ketziot military prison, calling for the
release of the 2,500 Arabs detained without trial, many of them
held in the prison.
   ``If the people got their rights then the artists, Jewish and
Palestinian, would not have to come here,'' said Suleiman Mansour,
a Palestinian artist. ``We demand the release of Palestinian
prisoners, but our biggest demand is self-determination and a state
for the Palestinian people.''
   Israeli author Amos Keinan said several of those jailed are
Palestinian writers who were among the 25 Arabs and Jews signing a
symbolic ``peace treaty'' at a June ceremony in Jerusalem.

   A congresswoman seeking her fifth term
could be removed from the ballot because of two minor discrepancies
on her declaration of candidacy, authorities said Saturday.
   Two Democratic candidates said they would decide this week
whether to ask the state Board of Elections to invalidate
Republican Rep. Claudine C. Schneider's candidacy because of a
missing middle initial and an address that said ``avenue'' instead
of ``street.''
   Stephen Robertson, a convicted murderer running as an
independent candidate in the district, said Saturday that he had
filed a formal objection with the board based on the two errors.
   Schneider was the second Rhode Island Republican congressional
candidate to encounter a filing error last week. Former state GOP
chairman John A. Holmes Jr. had to withdraw from the race in the
state's other district Thursday after a campaign aide failed to
file his declaration of candidacy by the 4 p.m. deadline.
   Holmes was automatically disqualified because the law setting
the filing deadline allows no exceptions. But Schneider will remain
on the ballot unless the Board of Elections upholds an objection
against her, election officials said. There was no one in the
elections board office Saturday to confirm that Robertson had filed
his petition.
   If Schneider is removed from the ballot, she would have to wage
a write-in campaign. She is unopposed on the Republican ticket.
   An aide, Robert Rendine, said he did not know how the error
occurred but he believed Schneider will remain on the ballot.
   ``The intent of the law is to remove any confusion and make sure
that a candidate is who he says he is,'' Rendine said. ``In the
case of a four-term incumbent congresswoman, I don't think there's
any doubt.''
   The Democratic-controlled Board of Canvassers in Schneider's
hometown of Narragansett voted Friday along party lines to
invalidate her filing form because her signature and address on the
form did not match those on her voter registration card.
   State law requires the form and the registration to match
exactly. In March, the Board of Elections threw a would-be Jesse
Jackson delegate off the presidential primary ballot because of the
same middle-initial problem faced by Schneider. That case is now in
federal court.
   Schneider signed her form with her middle initial, which does
not appear on her registration, and listed her address as 56
Central Ave., although her registration gives her address _
correctly _ as Central Street.
   ``We thought it was kind of trite ourselves, but we thought it
was our job to determine whether they matched to the letter of the
law,'' said Walter V. Boyle, one of two Democrats on the
three-member Board of Canvassers.
   After the Narragansett board's vote, Secretary of State Kathleen
S. Connell, a Democrat whose office is responsible for elections,
said she would issue Schneider nomination papers anyway.
   ``We were not elected to knock people off the ballot,'' Connell
said. ``I don't think the electorate wants elections decided by
initials and periods.''
   Boyle said the Narragansett board will not file a formal
objection, but Ruth Morgenthau and Paul O. Iacono, the two
Democrats competing in the Sept. 14 primary for the right to
challenge Schneider, said they might do so.
   ``It doesn't make any difference whether it's George Bush or
John Holmes or Claudine Schneider or John Doe in the street. The
law is the law,'' Iacono said. ``If you start making exceptions,
then all those other people in past years who have not had
exceptions made will be left out.''
   Morgenthau took a somewhat softer line. ``I expect to win this
election on my merits and I don't like to see a candidate
disqualified on technicalities,'' she said.

   Most of the country was without
power Saturday because of widespread rebel sabotage and a strike by
3,500 electricity repair and maintenance workers, authorities said.
   Five technicians trying to repair damaged power stations have
been killed by mines left behind by leftist rebels, utility
officials said.
   Also, some residents said parts of the capital are without water
because electricity-powered pumps are not working.
   Gen. Abdul Gutierrez, president of the state-owned electric
company, said leftist guerrillas from the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front have destroyed 24 electrical towers since
Wednesday, downing six of the 19 national transmission lines.
   Guerrillas have been battling the U.S.-backed government since
1980.
   The damage has not been repaired because of the strike by
technicians and other workers, Gutierrez said at a news conference
Friday. The workers, who walked out June 15, are demanding salary
increases, vacations and life insurance.
   Damage has cut service 70 percent nationwide and 80 percent in
the capital, leaving only areas where there are military
installations or medical services with power, officials said.
   The electricity utility, the Lempa River Hydroelectic Executive
Commission, is commonly known as CEL.
   ``The strike does not include suspension of service, but if
there is guerrilla sabotage or there are deficiencies in the
maintenance system we will not work on the repairs until the
demands are met,'' Rene Rodriguez, president of the CEL Employees'
Association, said.
   Workers are asking $60 a month increases, $4 a day for
job-related travel expenses and $10,000 in personal life insurance.
They say rebel mines left near the installations make the repair
jobs dangerous.
   Five technicians have died and five others have been disabled by
wounds from the mines, Rodriguez said.
   Salaries for the maintenance and repair workers are estimated at
$140 to $200 monthly.
   Electric company officials refused to negotiate with workers,
arguing that the association has no legal standing. It lost its
legal registration and was officially dissolved after a strike in
1980. Employees were accused of being leftists.
   The company says that 430 incidents of sabotage between Jan. 1
and June 15 caused $9 million in damage and destroyed 50 structures.

<TEXT>
   The deputy chairman of Yasser Arafat's
Fatah organization said Saturday a call by an Arafat aide for
direct negotiations with Israel was premature.
   Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in Fatah _ the largest group in the
Palestine Liberation Organization _ criticized the timing of the
proposal made last month by Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat's spokesman.
Arafat is chairman of the PLO, an umbrella organization of
different Palestinian factions.
   ``My objection is less to the substance of Bassam's declaration
than to the language and the concessions expressed,'' Khalaf said
in an interview on Radio Tunis. He said he was speaking only for
himself and not on behalf of Fatah.
   Sharif's statement ``came at the moment when the Palestinian
people are in insurrection against the Israeli occupiers who
exercise an implacable oppression against this people,'' Khalaf
said. He referred to the uprising by Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat has not said if he authorized Sharif's statement.

   A federal appeals court ruling could lead
to the release of two Tuscarora Indians who have been held without
bond for six months while awaiting trial on hostage-taking charges,
an attorney said Saturday.
   Attorney William Kunstler said the 4th U.S. Court of Appeals
ruled Thursday that a federal magistrate did not provide a timely
detention hearing for Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs last
February.
   ``Imagine, they have lost a half-year of their lives,'' Kunstler
said.
   Kunstler, in a telephone interview from New York, said he
received a copy of the opinion on Saturday. The appeals court in
Richmond, Va., was closed for the holiday weekend and the ruling
could not be independently confirmed.
   The court ruled that the magistrate failed to hold a detention
hearing within the required five days, Kunstler said. The appeals
court sent the case back to U.S. District Court in Raleigh for
``prompt determination of appropriate conditions of pretrial
release,'' Kunstler said.
   Hatcher, 30, and Jacobs, 19, are set to go on trial July 11 on
federal charges of hostage-taking and manufacturing illegal
firearms. The two held up to 20 people hostage Feb. 1 at The
Robesonian newspaper offices in Lumberton, near the South Carolina
border.
   The hostages were freed after the two negotiated a deal that
included the establishment of a state task force to investigate
their charges of alleged corruption among Robeson County officials.
No one was injured in the incident.
   Hatcher and Jacobs were being held Saturday in held in the
Craven County Jail in New Bern, about 120 miles east of Lumberton.
   The two men had gone before Magistrate Wallace Dixon on Feb. 2
but didn't have their detention hearing until Feb. 17. At that
time, Dixon ordered them held without bond.
   Kunstler said Dixon contends the two Indians waived their
detention hearing, saying they were afraid to be released. But
Kunstler said defendants cannot legally waive their own hearing.
   Attorneys for Hatcher and Jacobs appealed in April before U.S.
District Court Judge Terrence Boyle, but he upheld the magistrate's
decision.
   ``A lot of the delays here are the judges ... they just don't
give a damn about the Indians,'' said Kunstler, who is with the
Center for Constitutional Rights.
   Kunstler said attorneys would seek a hearing before Boyle next
week on the release of Hatcher and Jacobs.
   Another attorney for the two men, Bob Warren of the Christic
Institute South of Carrboro, N.C., was trying to reach Assistant
U.S. Attorney John Stuart Bruce on Saturday to discuss the matter,
said Gayle Korotkin, also of the institute.
   Telephone calls to Bruce's home on Saturday were not answered.

   From a woman wearing a button showing fallen
reformer Boris Yeltsin to a spirited conversation between shoppers
in a food store, the Communist Party conference encouraged ordinary
Soviets to speak their minds.
   ``It was a lesson in democracy,'' proclaimed Alexei Medvedev, a
35-year-old scientist encountered Saturday by a reporter in
downtown Moscow.
   Excitement over the four-day conference that ended Friday was
evident. When a reporter asked one Soviet in the street for his
reaction, at least 100 other people gathered to listen or join in.
Many carried newspapers with extensive reports on the proceedings.
   The hottest sensations of the conference, according to about a
dozen Soviets gathered in 86-degree heat, were speeches Friday by
Yeltsin and the No. 2 man in the Kremlin, Yegor K. Ligachev, who
skewered Yelstin's appeal for rehabilitation.
   In his speech, Yeltsin continued the blunt talk that made him
popular among Muscovites but that led to his ouster as Moscow party
boss in November and from his non-voting seat on the ruling
Politburo in February.
   Yeltsin complained the party's reform proposals didn't go far
enough and said his only mistake in speaking out last October
before the party Central Committee was that he spoke too soon.
   But Ligachev, a rival of Yeltsin and considered a conservative
counterweight to Gorbachev on the Politburo, said Yeltsin was full
of ``destructive energy'' and hadn't learned his lesson.
   At one Moscow food store, several Soviets were overheard
condemning Ligachev. The scene was similar on Pushkin Square.
   ``Yeltsin's speech was superb,'' a woman shouted to a reporter.
``Then Ligachev spoke, and he's a scandal monger.'' The woman then
stalked off.
   Former political prisoner and dissident journalist Lev Timofeyev
said the conference was the most lively and democratic Communist
Party meeting in recent times, but that it skirted key issues.
   ``For us, practical results will be whether they release
political prisoners, how they treat the independent press and
whether they end repression against people in independent groups,''
Timofeyev said by telephone.
   A man who would identify himself only as Roger called The
Associated Press bureau in Moscow to read a statement saying, ``The
conference has been a total collapse of all our hopes.
   ``It marks the start ... It is the start of a new era of
repressive regime,'' the man said.
   Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for the Democratic Union, a fledgling
political group offering itself as an alternative to the Communist
Party, said by telephone the conference was ``a victory of
conservative revolutionists.''
   ``It is not the radical reform that people expected,'' Mityunov
said. ``It is only restructuring of the system of bureaucratic
management of the country, and I think it won't help solve the very
difficult problems.''
   Noting that Gorbachev's call for more openness is not a
guarantee of free speech, Mityunov said three members of his group
were detained Friday night and fined or jailed for seeking
signatures on a petition demanding that jailed Democratic Union
activists be released.
   The crowd on Pushkin Square, which has become a gathering place
for political activists and those curious enough to want to watch
demonstrations, was grateful for the chance to hear Ligachev on
television.
   ``Yesterday we saw who Ligachev really is,'' Medvedev said. ``
He's a demagogue.'' Medvedev lived in Sverdlovsk while Yeltsin was
party boss there before coming to Moscow, and he remains a Yeltsin
partisan.
   Irina Bogantsyeva, a teacher, displayed a button she said she
made after Yeltsin got in trouble in October. She had typed
Yeltsin's name on a newspaper photograph, encased it in plastic and
affixed it to her blouse.
   ``The only reason I haven't turned in my party membership
card,'' Bogantsyeva said angrily, ``is that I belong to the same
party to which Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin belongs.''
   Another woman proposed forming a ``Yeltsin Defense Committee''
and a third, Nina P. Shumilkina from Alma Ata, capital of the
Kazakhstan republic, claimed: ``If we started a petition in defense
of Yeltsin, millions would sign it.''
   Ligachev denied in his speech that he opposed perestroika,
Gorbachev's program to modernize the political and economic system.
But Shumilkina said that ``if Ligachev were at the wheel,
perestroika would come to a standstill.'' Medvedev said the
conference and broadcasts of its activities were landmarks.
   ``Yesterday was a historic day,'' he said. ``We finally got real
political debate, and it was shown on television.''

   Rangers shot and killed four poachers
hunting rhinoceroses, whose horns are famed for their alleged
aphrodisiac powers, state parks chief Glenn Tatham said Saturday.
   A fifth member of the group escaped.
   The rangers spotted the five men, armed with automatic rifles,
in Zimbabwe's remote northern Zambezi valley and killed them in a
gunfight, Tatham said.
   The fifth poacher crossed a river into Zambia on a rubber
mattress he stole from a fishing camp, Tatham said.
   In recent years, poachers in Zimbabwe have killed more than 400
black rhinos, whose horns have a value of about $25,000 on the
black market. There are an estimated 1,500 rhinos left in the
country, the largest surviving population of the species in the
world.
   Forty-three poachers have been killed since rangers launched an
operation three years ago to save the animals.

<HEAD>Ex-Pacific Fleet Chief Accuses Military Officials of Trying To

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former commander of the U.S. Pacific
Fleet denied that he is involved in the Pentagon bribery and fraud
scandal being investigated by the Justice Department and accused a
``very vindictive clique'' of trying to destroy him and former Navy
Secretary John F. Lehman.
   Retired Adm. James A. ``Ace'' Lyons Jr. retired last Oct. 1
after serving two years as commander of the Pacific fleet.
According to Pentagon sources, Lyons was prodded into retirement by
Lehman's successor as Navy secretary, James Webb. Lyons has worked
as a consultant to the McDonnell Douglas Corp. since at least last
December.
   Lyons said in an interview published in Saturday's editions of
the Los Angeles Times that top Navy officials approved the
consulting contract with McDonnell Douglas at a time when they knew
the FBI was investigating alleged fraud within the defense industry.
   The Navy confirmed to the newspaper that Lyons was cleared to
work for McDonnell Douglas.
   ``I'm not associated with this other crap,'' Lyons said,
referring to allegations that defense consultants have used
classified information to help companies win military contracts.
``So why in the hell was I even brought into this other than to
discredit me.''
   Neither Lyons nor Lehman is a target of the ongoing fraud
investigation.
   However, Lyons' name appeared on a search warrant served at
McDonnell Douglas' St. Louis headquarters stated that investigators
were seeking any contracts, agreements, reports, payment records or
any other documents ``relating to the work of Ace Lyons for the
McDonnell Douglas from December 1987 through 1988.
   Lyons said his job with McDonnell Douglas was to convince the
South Koreans that they needed an all-weather, night fighter-attack
plane such as the F-18 produced by McDonnell Douglas.
   Lyons told the Times that Navy officials gave McDonnell Douglas
the go-ahead to hire him so that he and Lehman would be embarrassed.
   ``We've got a very vindictive clique who wants to destroy Lehman
and me, certainly with Lehman being the real target,'' Lyons was
quoted as saying.
   Both Webb and Justice Department chief spokesman Patrick S.
Korten denied the retired admiral's allegations.
   ``That's an odd combination of ignorance and meglomania,''
Korten said.
   Webb told the Times that the accusations were ``absolutely
ridiculous'' and that he had nothing to do with any effort to
discredit Lehman.
   ``There are people who don't like Lehman, people who don't like
me,'' Webb said. ``That is the name of the game when you go into
government. If people are using this against Lehman, it has nothing
to do with me.''

<HEAD>Some Drought Areas Get Rain But Not Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell Saturday over some sections of the nation's drought
belt, but not enough to break the back of the dry spell, and
Virginia farmers who were helped two years ago by donated hay
returned the favor to an Ohio village.
   And the drought created a mini religious dispute in Illinois,
where Gov. James R. Thompson declared Sunday ``a day of prayer for
rain.''
   Thompson's action angered American Atheists, based at Austin,
Texas. ``Government must stop telling citizens when to pray, what
to pray, how to pray or even if they should pray,'' the group said
in a statement Saturday.
   Showers and thunderstorms spread during the morning from
northwestern Texas and the Texas Panhandle into southwestern
Oklahoma and from Arkansas across western Tennessee, northern
Mississippi and Alabama.
   More than an inch of rain fell on parts of central and northern
Arkansas, flooding some streets in North Little Rock, and the
storms knocked out electricity to thousands of customers.
   ``It certainly has helped out an awful lot,'' meteorologist Mike
Thompson in Little Rock said of the rain. But he added that some
parts of the state haven't had a drop in weeks and ``We're still
anywhere from two to 12 inches below normal in the state.
   ``We're going to need a couple of more weeks of weather like
this to really make a dent in the drought, and it doesn't look like
that will be the case.''
   In Michigan's central Upper Peninsula, crews reported about 85
percent containment Saturday of a fire that burned 1,200 acres in
the tinder-dry Hiawatha National Forest, a U.S. Forest spokeswoman
said.
   The fire forced about 60 families to evacuate their homes
overnight along Lake Michigan's Little Bay de Noc, but they were
allowed back early Saturday, said spokeswoman Mary Mumford. Two
outbuildings were destroyed, she said.
   A section of U.S. 2 east of Rapid River and nearby Wisconsin
Central Railroad tracks were closed for about five hours Friday
night before crews extinguished flames along both routes, Mumford
said.
   Trucks carrying some 2,000 bales of donated hay for
drought-stricken farmers arrived at Coldwater, Ohio, on Saturday as
Virginia farmers returned a favor. The hay was divided among about
50 farmers who were involved in the 1986 haylift to Virginia, when
the Southeast suffered its own drought.
   ``At the time, (1986) I had a lot of hay in my barn and I
thought it was the thing to do,'' said farmer Ralph Heyne, who
donated about 1,500 bales to Virginia. ``It was an easy thing to do
when my barn was full. I wish we were sending it down this time.''
   A Wisconsin official estimates his state's 2-month-old drought
may bankrupt more farmers and slash crop yields and dairy herd
sizes more than any other aspect of the sluggish farm economy of
the 1980s.
   ``It has singly done more damage than anything since the 1930s.
There's nothing that compares to what the drought has done so far,
even if we get good weather from here in,'' said Richard Rodefeld,
an economist with the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and
Consumer Protection.
   Fish biologists in Wisconsin are urging fishermen to use
restraint while officials consider the possibility of curtailing
trout fishing altogether because of the drought. Trout populations
were down 40 percent to 60 percent on two rivers in the Antigo area
surveyed recently.
   ``One of the things that's really important out here is tourism
and the outdoors and when the trout fishermen know the fishing is
down, they don't spend as much money on bait and tackle and hotel
rooms,'' Max Johnson, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
fish manager at Antigo, said of the Eau Claire River. ``People come
from all over to fish this stream.''
   An estimated 5 million trout swim in about 8,900 miles of trout
stream in Wisconsin, according to the DNR. Each year, about 200,000
anglers take about 1.75 million trout, said Lee Kernen, DNR chief
of the fisheries section.

   Pope John Paul II on Saturday warned
followers of Marcel Lefebvre they will be excommunicated if they
stay with the rebel prelate, but he promised the church will meet
their traditionalist needs if they remain loyal to the papacy.
   The Vatican announced Saturday that Monsignor Antonio de Castro
Mayer, a Brazilian prelate who assisted Lefebvre in consecrating
four traditionalist bishops, had been excommunicated.
   Lefebvre and the four bishops were excommunicated Thursday after
Lefebvre defied the pope and performed the consecrations without
his approval. The consecration led to the first church schism in
118 years.
   ``No one should ignore that formal adhesion to the schism
constitutes a grave offense to God and leads to excommunication
established by the right of the church,'' the pope said in his
first public statement on the case since the consecrations in
Econe, Switzerland.
   In an apostolic letter to bishops, he urged Lefebvre's followers
to ``fulfill the serious obligation to remain united with the vicar
of Christ in the unity of the church and not to continue to sustain
(Lefebvre's) movement in any way.''
   A spokesman for Lefebvre in Econe said the prelate and other
leaders were not available for comment Saturday.
   To those wishing to remain faithful to the papacy, John Paul
promised to guarantee their traditionalist needs, giving special
attention to the 16th Century Tridentine Mass.
   ``To all those Catholic faithful, who feel close to some older
liturgical forms and disciplines of the Latin tradition, I would
like to express my will ... to facilitate their spiritual unity
with the church, through the means necessary to guarantee respect
for their just aspirations,'' the pope said in the letter, which
was released in both Latin and Italian by the Vatican.
   John Paul said he was setting up a special Vatican commission,
headed by a cardinal, to ``facilitate complete unification'' with
those Lefebvre followers who prefer to remain with the mainstream
church.
   He said the panel would seek to preserve ``their spiritual and
liturgical traditions.''
   Lefebvre and his followers reject many reforms of the Second
Vatican Council, 1962-65, including the replacement of the Latin
Mass with a simplified liturgy in the modern local language.
   A few years ago, the Vatican issued a decree saying the
Tridentine Mass could be celebrated with special permission.
   The pope indicated he would permit wider use of the ancient
liturgy, saying ``a broad and generous application'' of the decree
would be allowed.
   Lefebvre claims millions of sympathizers around the world.
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said recently that Lefebvre's
supporters numbered 80,000 to 100,000, but other Vatican officials
have said about half a million people turn to his priests for
various church functions.
   John Paul said the church as a whole reacted with ``great
distress'' to Thursday's consecrations, which ``made useless years
of efforts'' to reach a settlement with Lefebvre's Piux X
Fraternity.
   ``This despair is felt particularly by the successor of Peter
(the pope) ... even if the number of people directly involved in
these events is small,'' he wrote.
   ``This act of disobedience _ which signifies the outright
rejection of the Roman primate _ constitutes a schismatic act,''
the pope said, noting that the prelates involved ``have incurred
the grave penalty of excommunication as foreseen under
ecclesiastical discipline.''
   He called Lefebvre's action ``contradictory'' to the church
traditions Lefebvre says he represents.
   ``One cannot remain faithful to tradition by breaking ecclesial
ties with the man whom Christ himself, in the person of the apostle
Peter, entrusted the ministry of the unity of his church,'' the
letter said.
   The pope said the schism should encourage theologians to make a
renewed examination of the Second Vatican Council reforms,
``especially on those points of doctrine which, perhaps because of
their novelty, have not yet been understood well by some sectors in
the church.''
   All Catholics, he said, should ``reflect sincerely on their own
faithfulness to the tradition of the church.''
   Lefebvre, 82, was suspended from his priestly duties in 1976 by
Pope Paul VI. But in defiance of the Vatican, he has ordained 220
priests who are officiating in 28 countries. Lefebvre's movement
also has an estimated 200 seminarians.
   Those excommunicated with Lefebvre and Castro Mayer were the
four new bishops: Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais,
Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galaretta.
   An excommunicated Roman Catholic is unable to receive the church
sacraments, which include the eucharist and last rites.
   The schism provoked by Lefebvre was the first since 1870, when
the Old Catholics broke with the Vatican over the doctrine of papal
infallibility.

   A jury that convicted Gary Heidnik of
killing two women in his basement torture chamber, including one
who died by electrocution, ordered Saturday that he die in the
electric chair.
   ``Now my sister can rest in peace. I feel happy,'' said Denise
Dudley, sister of electrocution victim Deborah Johnson Dudley. ``We
got what we wanted. He's going to die.''
   Jurors deliberated nearly two hours before choosing death
sentences instead of life imprisonment for the two first-degree
murder counts on which they convicted Heidnik on Friday.
   The panel, chosen in Pittsburgh because of pretrial publicity
here, also had convicted him of kidnapping and rape in the
imprisonment of four other women in his Philadelphia row house.
   Common Pleas Judge Lynne Abraham thanked the jurors, dismissed
them and formally imposed one of the death sentences. That will
allow the the 44-year-old defendant to be removed from the city's
overcrowded prison system and placed in a state prison.
   ``I don't feel very good,'' Heidnik's lawyer, A. Charles Peruto
Jr., said after the two death verdicts.
   Peruto, who had presented an insanity defense, said Heidnik
``really didn't express anything over the verdict or over the
penalty.'' Heidnik showed no emotion as the jury forewoman read the
sentence.
   Heidnik, who has been under treatment for schizophrenia for 25
years, has been receiving a drug that tends to keep him sedated.
   Peruto said Heidnik was insane and was mentally ill when he
committed the crimes between November 1986 and March 1987.
   ``This man is legally sane and he knew what he was doing and he
did it with torture,'' Assistant District Attorney Charles
Gallagher said in arguing for the death penalty. He said later he
was ``gratified'' with the jury's decision.
   Besides the two murder charges, Heidnik also was found guilty
Friday of kidnapping, rape, aggravated assault and involuntary
deviate sexual intercourse. He was acquitted on one count of the
latter charge.
   The judge set Oct. 5 for sentencing on those charges, formal
sentencing on the second murder conviction and a post-trial
hearing. The judge told Peruto to file motions for a new trial,
even though the attorney had indicated earlier that his client
wasn't interested in an appeal.
   ``I'm going to file an appeal,'' Peruto said Saturday. ``I don't
know if he wants an appeal or not. The only discussion we've had on
this is that he wants to get it over with.''
   Even without an appeal, the death sentences will automatically
be reviewed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
   No one has been executed in Pennsylvania since 1962, but there
are more than 80 people on death row in the state. A technical
challenge to the state's execution law is currently before the
state's high court.
   During the trial, the jury heard testimony about how Heidnik
lured six women, imprisoned them in his basement, repeatedly raped
and tortured them, and eventually killed two of them.
   One woman, Sandra Lindsay, died while being chained to a rafter,
and Heidnik sawed up her body and fed part of the remains to the
other captives, according to testimony. Ms. Dudley was electrocuted
when Heidnik touched live wires to her chains while she stood in a
water-filled pit, according to testimony.
   ``I was hoping for death. It's what he deserves,'' said Teresa
Lomax, sister of Ms. Lindsay. ``He's going to die, and he should
die.''

   A military spokesman on Saturday denied
reports Syria was planning to buy advanced surface-to-surface
missiles from China.
   News reports last month quoted Israeli officials as saying the
government of President Hafez Assad was discussing with China the
possibilty of purchasing the missile that is still in the
experimental stage.
   ``The real fact which is very well known to the Israelis is that
there is no such deal between Syria and China and there is no
discussion about it,'' said the Syrian military spokesman speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   He said Syria has the missiles needed for its defense and
accused Israel of spreading the rumor as a ploy to get more
American aid.
   The news reports said Syria was intending to buy the M-9
missile, which has an estimated range of 375 miles. China may have
tested the missile for the first time in June, according to the
reports.
   Israeli officials said the missile could be a serious threat to
Israel and could be armed with chemical weapons. But they said they
had no information of an imminent sale.

<HEAD>Episcopalians To Address Issues On Gays, AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Episcopal Church's 69th General Convention
opened Saturday with a church official saying that while marriage
among homosexuals and the AIDS epidemic are on the agenda they
shouldn't dominate the meeting.
   Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning asked about 4,000 people in
his opening address to ``look beyond particular issues to what
unites us,'' expressing concern that the church could become a
``single-issue church.''
   ``I hope that we do not let any one particular issue dominate
the convention. That is not to say that issues are not important,''
he said.
   The triennial convention will look into the issue of setting a
policy to recognize ``single-sex marriages.''
   ``We have a ministry to the gay community,'' Browning said. ``We
are struggling to find out what that means. We are not going to
back away from it, because there are some voices that question
whether this is the thing to do.
   ``The way we can be more understanding is to stay in
communication and avoid a judgmental approach in this ministry.''
   The Rev. David B. Collins, deputy president of the convention's
House of Deputies, said the church should recognize all
relationships regardless of sexual preference.
   ``We have been supportive of (single-sex) marriage and we have
to get back to that,'' Collins said. ``We're being unfaithful to
marriage.''
   Gay rights became an open issue in the church in 1976 when the
general convention affirmed gays as ``children of God,'' decried
violence and prejudice against them and asked a special church
commission to study whether they should be ordained to the
priesthood.
   In 1979, despite a positive recommendation of the special
commission, the convention narrowly defeated a proposal to open the
priesthood to gays. Twenty-one bishops, including Browning,
immediately declared their opposition to the ban.
   Despite the ban, gays continued to be ordained since bishops had
a wide latitude in interpretation within their dioceses.
   Also on the convention's agenda are women's roles in the church
and compassion toward AIDS victims.
   Earlier Saturday, in his address to the opening session of the
House of Deputies, Collins said ``the greatest shame of the
Episcopal church is the lack of intensity of faith.''
   Collins cited a survey by the Washington Post-L.A. Times news
service that showed Episcopalians are less likely than members of
other denominations to say religion is ``very important'' in their
lives.
   ``Overall, 55 percent of Americans and 61 percent of
Protestants, but only 41 percent of Episcopalians, said that
religion was very important,'' Collins said.
   The Episcopal Church has 2.6 million members and 15,000 ordained
clergy in 7,500 parishes in the United States, church officials
said.

   Michael Dukakis picked fellow governor Bill
Clinton of Arkansas Saturday to nominate him for president at the
national convention, as the Democratic nominee-to-be met with two
congressmen and prepared to host Jesse Jackson on July Fourth.
   Clinton is the second southerner named to a prominent convention
speaking role. Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards was named last
week to deliver the keynote speech opening the convention in
Atlanta July 18.
   Clinton will address the delegates the next night, formally
nominating Dukakis for the party's presidential nomination. He will
deliver a 15-minute speech focusing on Dukakis' record as
Massachusetts governor and his leadership abilities, the Dukakis
campaign said.
   ``Bill Clinton is a leader among the nation's governors who
shares my commitment to building a strong economic future,''
Dukakis said in a campaign statement. ``He is an eloquent spokesman
for our party.''
   Clinton, who has worked at lengths with Dukakis as part of the
National Governors Association, told a news conference in Little
Rock that Dukakis is sincere about wanting to spur economic
development in the South.
   Dukakis ``was very forthright in discussing with me how
profoundly concerned he was that our part of the country was so
economically depressed and had been so neglected by the national
administration, and he said he just didn't understand how you could
have a national government that didn't try to help distressed areas
of the country,'' Clinton said.
   ``I think the American people ought to know that,'' Clinton
said. ``He cares about people who aren't as well off as he thinks
they ought to be, who don't have the opportunities that they ought
to have. That counts for a lot with me.''
   Tradition at recent conventions is for a brief nominating speech
followed by one or two seconding speeches. But Dukakis spokesman
Mark Gearan said Clinton would deliver the sole nominating address.
   Jackson, who is expected to have his name placed into nomination
as well, was scheduled to visit Dukakis on Monday. Jackson and his
wife, Jackie, were to dine with Dukakis and his wife, Kitty. They
then were to attend the traditional Boston Pops Independence Day
concert on the banks of the Charles River.
   Dukakis aides say the meeting is largely social but that they
expect the subject of the No. 2 spot on the ticket to come up.
   Jackson is being considered but Dukakis advisers say it is
highly unlikely that he would be offered the vice presidential
nomination. For his part, Jackson has said he has decided whether
he would accept if it was offered to him but has not said what he
has decided.
   Dukakis staffers assigned to the running mate search were
working through the holiday weekend, meeting in their secretive
fifth floor office of the campaign's headquarters. The handful of
campaign aides working on the search have elevator keys to gain
access to the floor.
   Sens. John Glenn of Ohio and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas are
considered the leading candidates, followed by Rep. Lee Hamilton of
Indiana and Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. Dukakis met with more than
30 senators and congressmen last week to discuss the search and has
additional Capitol Hill meetings set for July 13.
   In addition to the Jackson meeting, Dukakis on Monday was
scheduled to deliver a speech on national security.
   He returned from a Midwest campaign swing Friday afternoon and
was back at the Statehouse on Saturday morning.
   Dukakis, aides said, spent the majority of his time tending to
state business but also held an hour-long meeting with Reps.
William Gray III of Pennsylvania and David R. Obey of Wisconsin.
Gray is chairman of the House Budget Committee; Obey sits on the
House Appropriations Committee and the Joint Committee on Economics.

<HEAD>Report: Paisley, While Still At Pentagon, Helped RCA Get Military
Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Navy research chief Melvyn Paisley
helped RCA Corp. gain new Pentagon business after the company's
role in another big military project was cut back, in what was
allegedly a quid pro quo arrangement, according to a published
report.
   Defense News reported in its July 4 edition that Paisley, who
has emerged as a key figure in the ongoing investigation of abuses
in the Defense Department's weapons-buying system, brought RCA
``into the lucrative submarine electronics business'' through a
$2.4 billion project then known as the Submarine Advanced Combat
System, of SUBACS.
   Several sources told the newspaper that competition for the
project was cosmetic and that RCA had been destined to win. But the
newspaper said it was unclear why Paisley, who served at the
Pentagon from 1981 through April 1987, helped RCA obtain the SUBACS
contract in January 1986.
   In other developments related to the defense probe:
   _The Los Angeles Times reported in Saturday's editions that
retired Adm. James A. ``Ace'' Lyons Jr. denied in an interview that
he was involved bribery and fraud in the defense contracting
industry.
   Lyons, who has worked as a consultant to the McDonnell Douglas
Corp. since at least last December, also accused a ``very
vindictive clique'' of trying to destroy him and former Navy
Secretary John F. Lehman.
   ``I'm not associated with this other crap,'' Lyons said,
referring to allegations that defense consultants have used
classified information to help companies win military contracts.
   Lyons is not a target of the ongoing fraud investigation,
although his name appeared on a search warrant served at McDonnell
Douglas' St. Louis headquarters last month.
   _The Los Angeles newspaper also said sources have told the
newspaper that Paisley was the subject of a 1983 FBI probe that
examined allegations of bribery and electronic eavesdropping.
   The newspaper, citing an unidentified source familiar with the
1983 investigation, said then-U.S. Attorney Elsie Munsell declined
to prosecute Paisley following the probe in part because the
statute of limitations on the electronic eavesdropping, which
allegedly took place in 1970, had expired.
   She also declined to prosecute, the source said, because the
Boeing Co., on whose behalf Paisley had allegedly paid bribes, had
already pleaded guilty to charges of failing to disclose at least
$7 million in commissions it paid to overseas agents to help win
airline orders.
   Both Ms. Munsell and Henry E. Hudson, who succeeded her in 1986
and is now managing the Pentagon fraud investigation, declined
comment.
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, dismissed the report
as ``a regurgitation of unfounded allegations that have been
examined many times.''
   In its story, Defense News said Paisley's involvement with RCA
came as the company's role in the Aegis shipboard electronics
program was significantly reduced when the Navy awarded Sperry
Corp. a second-source contract on the project. Sperry is now part
of the Detroit-based Unisys Corp.
   ``RCA executives paid a call on Paisley and said `Why are you
messing Aegis up?''' the newspaper quoted one source as saying.
Paisley's ``answer was `just shut up and accept it and I'll take
care of you in other ways.'''
   At the time, IBM Corp.'s Federal Systems Division in Manassas,
Va., was designing the SUBACS signal processing and targeting
system for the Navy's newest attack submarines.
   As the company encountered some technical problems and cost
overruns with the project, members of Congress began questioning
the program, and Navy officials, including Paisley, expressed
concern about its fate.
   The newspaper quoted one sources as saying there was ``clear
bias against IBM'' and another as saying ``Paisley was determined
to get to competition with IBM.''
   The Navy decided to break up the submarine combat program and
RCA joined the competition to build it, but ``it was a beauty
contest,'' a source said. The competition ``doesn't mean anything.
RCA (had) already been selected.''
   Several months after the contract was awarded to RCA, the firm
was acquired by General Electric.
   General Electric spokesman William Shuman declined to comment on
the contract, saying ``as far as we know we are not part of the FBI
(investigation),'' the newspaper said.
   It said Paisley's attorney, Barcella, declined to discuss his
client's involvement in the project.

<HEAD>Investigators Search For Cause Of Fire That Killed Five
Firefighters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flags flew at half staff throughout the
city Saturday for five firefighters killed in one fire, and
condolences came in from other firefighters from around the nation.
   The men killed Friday in a car dealership fire were the first
firefighters killed in action in Hackensack, and their department
brought in counselors to help its 91 members cope with their loss.
   Fire Chief Anthony Aiellos said a police captain from Fort Lee
and two assistants who have had counseling experience met twice
with Hackensack firefighters in an effort to alleviate ``this type
of stress. This hasn't happened in the city before.''
   ``This only happens in other cities, you know?'' he said at a
news conference.
   Firefighters and law enforcement officials from across the
country sent messages of condolence, Aiellos said.
   ``We've had calls from Texas, Atlanta, Georgia, the New York
City Fire Department, It's very touching,'' Aiellos said.
   Flags throughout the city were lowered to half-staff, black
bunting draped a firehouse and Aiellos began meeting with the
victims' families Saturday to try to comfort them.
   ``I'd just like to say there may be as good firefighters in the
country, in the world. There's no better, absolutely none better,''
Aiellos said.
   ``I've seen these guys in operation. When the time comes, they
do their job, no matter the risk involved,' he said.
   The firefighters were killed instantly when the building's
interior roof collapsed at Hackensack Ford and Mazda. The
firefighters were trying to cut a hole in the ceiling so they could
extinguish the fire burning between the false ceiling and the roof.
   Aiellos said the dealership, which he estimated was 30 years
old, met existing building codes when it was constructed. But
revised codes probably would have forced the owners to rethink the
design, he said. He did not say how the construction might have
been different under current fire codes.
   The Bergen County Arson Task Force joined the city's fire
department in investigating the cause of the blaze, but preliminary
investigation indicated that arson was not to blame, Aiellos said.
   Company officials declined to comment and Aiellos said
authorities could not put a dollar figure on the damage.
   Killed in the blaze were Capt. Richard Williams, 54, a 24-year
firefighter who had four children; Lt. Richard Reinhagen, 48, with
23 years in the department and two children; firefighter William
Krejsa, 52, with 24 years' experience and three children;
firefighter Leonard Radumski 38, a 13-year firefighter with one
child; and firefighter Stephen Ennis, 30, a five-year veteran with
one child.

<HEAD>Jackson To Take Minority Planks To Floor Of Democratic Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Saturday he will go to the
floor of the Democratic National Convention to push for including a
dozen of his policy proposals in the party's platform.
   ``We ... are determined at this point to take all 12 of our
minority planks to the floor in Atlanta ... in order to inform,
inspire and open up the process, to make our convention one of
substance,'' Jackson said at a news conference on the lawn of his
home.
   The convention's Platform Committee last week overwhelmingly
rejected the planks proposed by Jackson, including a call for
boosting taxes on the wealthy, freezing defense spending, pledging
no first use of nuclear weapons and doubling the money spent on
education.
   ``We will take to the convention ... the kind of program agenda
that will expand our party and make us stronger,'' Jackson said.
   Asked whether he thought his decision might divide the party,
Jackson said that was ``an unfair accusation ... we can have unity
without uniformity.''
   Jackson said he looked forward to discussing the convention and
party platform at his Fourth of July meeting in Boston with
Dukakis, when the candidates and their wives are to have dinner
together and attend a concert.
   Jackson made his remarks after meeting at his home with a group
of key advisers, including his campaign chairman, Willie Brown, the
California Assembly speaker, platform committee chairwoman Eleanor
Holmes Norton, and Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's
non-voting delegate in Congress.
   Dukakis supporters contended that the Jackson proposals would
cost the party support among moderate voters and provide campaign
ammunition to Vice President George Bush.
   Jackson said the Pentagon defense contract procurement scandal
had encouraged him to go to the convention floor with his defense
spending freeze proposal.
   He said ``no one feels any more insecure'' after Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci announced Friday his decision to freeze
$1.1 billion worth of contracts thought to be tainted.
   ``If we in fact cut our military budget without cutting our
defense and more effectively use our resources for long-term health
care, affordable housing and education, we will be a better and
stronger nation,'' he said.
   Jackson said there had been ``good negotiations'' so far with
the Dukakis camp, which would continue prior to the July 18 start
of the convention, but he said he could not imagine a convention
``where there is simply no floor debate.''

   A car bomb exploded Saturday
outside a stadium as thousands of fans left a rugby match, killing
two people, injuring 26 and setting nearby buildings ablaze, police
and witnesses said.
   The minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok, blamed the outlawed
African National Congress, the main organization trying to
overthrow the white-led government.
   Vlok called the attack ``barbaric'' and said police will ``leave
no stone unturned to find the murderers and to ensure the safety of
our people.''
   The blast occurred on a street alongside Johannesburg's Ellis
Park stadium minutes after crowds began pouring from the complex
following the match. Police spokesman Pierre Louw said the bomb
went off at 5:07 p.m.
   The rugby players and virtually all the spectators at the game
between Transvaal and Orange Free State were white. The stadium is
the largest sports facility in the Johannesburg area and seats
75,000.
   No attendance figure was available. However, rugby is the most
popular team sport among whites and Saturday afternoon matches
generally attract at least 25,000 fans.
   Police said the two men killed were white and that several of
the injured were in serious condition. The injured included 23
whites, two blacks and one Asian, police said.
   The explosion occurred one day after the government proposed
tough new measures to enforce racial segregation. Critics said the
laws could mean mass eviction of blacks from areas designated for
whites only.
   Metal from the car that exploded was found up to 200 yards away
from the blast, witnesses said. Several nearby cars and buses were
extensively damaged, police said.
   Surrounding buildings in the downtown area were set ablaze, but
the fires were extinguished within minutes, witnesses said.
   Sportswriters covering the match said they saw flames leaping
more than 100 feet into the air after the explosion, the South
African Press Association reported.
   Police quickly cordoned off the area as several hundred
bystanders gathered. Several whites made racial slurs at blacks and
one minor scuffle broke out, SAPA reported.
   The blast was the latest in a recent series of bombs aimed at
civilian targets in Johannesburg and Pretoria, the capital.
   There have been more than 90 bombings since the government
declared a nationwide state of emergency in June 1986. About 25
have occurred this year.
   Police have blamed virtually all the attacks on the African
National Congress.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, seldom confirms or denies
involvement in specific attacks. However, recent statements by ANC
leaders suggest the organization now approves of attacks on
civilians, reversing its long-standing policy of striking mostly at
military and government targets.
   On Thursday, 13 whites and one black were hurt by a bomb that
exploded outside a fast-food restaurant in a Johannesburg shopping
center at the Poyntons Building, which houses the air force and
prison service headquarters.
   Hospital officials said no one was hurt seriously.
   The country is run under a system of apartheid, a policy of
segregatin that preserves power and privilege for South Africa's 5
million whites and denies rights and a voice in national affairs to
its 26 million blacks.
   On Friday, the government proposed amendments to the 35-year-old
Group Areas Act, which restricts blacks to certain areas. The
change calls for the hiring of inspectors to check violations of
the law.
   It would make it easier for authorities to confiscate property
and to evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated
for their race group.
   The amendment is to be debated next month.

<TEXT>
   Newspapers published on Saturday what television
had not shown the day before _ a fired Communist Party official's
stinging criticism of some of the most powerful men in the Soviet
Union.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the former Moscow Communist Party chief who
was fired in November, denounced Politburo member Mikhail S.
Solomentsev and others who served under the late President Leonid
I. Brezhnev. Brezhnev now is blamed for leading the country into a
period of stagnation and corruption during his rule from 1964-1982.
   But Yeltsin also demanded that such hidden subjects as Communist
Party finances be made public along with detailed biographies of
the nation's leaders and information about their luxurious summer
homes and guest houses.
   Yeltsin made he speech Friday at the final day of the four-day
Communist Party conference.
   Television showed segments of his address, including his appeal
for political rehabilitation but ignored his critical comments.
   Yeltsin was fired as Moscow party chief and removed as a
non-voting member of the ruling Politburo because of his remarks at
a party Central Committee meeting last October. His comments at
that meeting have never been published, but officials said he
blamed the bureaucracy for slowing the pace of reform planned by
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In his speech Friday as carried by the Soviet press, Yeltsin
said:
   ``Today it turns out that the only one guilty in the stagnation
was Brezhnev. But where were they who for 10, 15, 20 years, now as
well as then, were on the Politburo? Each time they voted in favor
of various programs.''
   He said those Politburo members brought the country to the brink
of crisis by electing a gravely ill Konstantin U. Chernenko party
leader in 1984. Chernenko died a year later and was succeeded by
Gorbachev.
   Yeltsin accused Solomentsev, 74-year-old head of the party's
Control Commission that is responsible for reviewing allegations of
misconduct by party members, of being soft on officials suspected
of corruption.
   ``I have to say this liberalism from Comrade Solomentsev toward
people who took bribes in the millions raises anxiety.''
Solomentsev was made a non-voting member of the Politburo in 1971
and a full member in 1983.
   Yeltsin said several Politburo members, who he did not identify,
should be made to answer for their part in creating serious
problems and then removed from the ruling body.
   That remark drew applause from some of the 5,000 delegates at
the conference, according to the transcripts published by the
Communist Party newspaper Pravda and government daily Izvestia.
   While Soviet television did not carry Yeltsin's critical
comments, it did cover in full Yegor K. Ligachev's attack on
Yeltsin. The two are political rivals and Yeltsin has urged that
Ligachev, the Kremlin's No. 2 man, quit.
   Yeltsin told the conference he knew how much money local party
organizations contribute to the Central Committee but he didn't
know where it all went.
   ``I only see that besides rational expenditures, they (party
leaders) build luxurious guest houses, sanatoriums and dachas of
such a size that it's embarrassing when people visit from other
(foreign) parties,'' he said.
   He called for open publication of biographies, incomes and other
information about ruling party officials.
   Yeltsin did not directly criticize Gorbachev, but he said he did
not understand the general secretary's proposal to make party
leaders also the head of the corresponding government council. The
plan apparently would ensure continued party dominance of the
government.
   Yeltsin also said that despite Gorbachev's efforts to open up
the party to greater debate and criticism, members of the Central
Committee still were afraid to express their views if they differed
from the party leader.

<HEAD>Women Protest Islamic Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of women demonstrated Saturday
in the Punjab capital of Lahore against their country's
implementation of Islamic law last month.
   Many women fear the new code will negate Moslem laws enacted in
1961 giving women the right to file for divorce or to demand the
right to register marriages and divorces.
   The demonstration by about 400 women was the second in as many
weeks against the change, announced in a decree June 15 by
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   In his televised address, Zia said Islamic law would be the
``supreme law'' of Pakistan. But he said the laws would not affect
the nation's non-Moslems.
   Witnesses at Saturday's protest said many of the women were
waving the flag of Pakistan's leading opposition party, the
Pakistan People's Party (PPP). The party is headed by Benazir
Bhutto, whose father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was deposed in a 1977
military coup led by Zia.
   In the southern port city of Karachi, meanwhile, political
opposition parties plotted election strategy in anticipation of an
election call by Zia. Zia, who is also army chief of staff,
dissolved Parliament May 29 and fired the country's civilian
government.
   Zia charged the government with, among other things, failing to
move quickly on imposing Islamic law in Pakistan.
   Zia promised to hold elections within the framework of the
constitution. But Pakistanis have debated whether the constitution
demands an election within 90 days or simply requires Zia to
announce a date within 90 days.

<HEAD>Say South African Commandos Planned To Free Jailed Suspects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African commandos failed in a plan
to free four South Africans held in a maximum security prison and
accused of terrorist attacks, security sources said Saturday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an
unspecified number of commandos had planned to intercept a police
convoy carrying the four detainees from a Harare magistrate's court
to the Chikurubi maximum security prison 12 miles outside of Harare
on Thursday.
   They gave no reason why the purported plan failed, but said
weapons and tear gas grenades were found near the route to the
prison.
   The four arrested whites are accused of involvement in five
attacks on African National Congress facilities in Zimbabwe. The
predominantly black ANC is the main guerrilla organization fighting
South Africa's white-dominated government.
   The four suspects appeared briefly Thursday before Harare
Magistrate Leonard Chitunhu and were remanded in custody to July
29. They are identified as Kevin Woods, 35, a former Zimbabwe
central intelligence officer; Michael Smith, 34; Barry Bawden, 30,
and Guy Bawden, 32.
   They were arrested after a car bomb demolished part of a house
occupied by ANC officials in the city of Bulawayo on Jan. 11. The
driver of the car carrying the explosives was killed in the blast.
   There was no official comment from the government on the report
by the security sources that South African commandos had planned to
free the four.
   The sources said that after attacking the police convoy the
commandos intended to use a stolen Zimbabwe air force helicopter to
fly the freed prisoners to an airstrip near the town of Kwekwe, 125
miles southwest of Harare, where a South African transport plane
was waiting to take them out of the country.

<HEAD>Teachers May Face Backlash On School Reform, Union Head Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with later quotations from
speech, picking up 3rd graf: `Nobody else ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The current wave of school reforms is bound
to fail and teachers will face an angry backlash unless they try
radically different ways of educating children, American Federation
of Teachers President Albert Shanker said Saturday.
   Shanker, in an interview and later in a keynote address to 3,000
delegates at the AFT convention, said, ``You can't stay out of the
issue of transforming the schools.''
   ``We are only educating to a fairly modest level of education a
shockingly small proportion of the youngsters who go to school,''
he said in his 95-minute speech.
   Public schools could face the same, slow ``death on the
installment plan'' that beset the American auto industry, he said.
   ``It isn't that we're not trying hard or that we're not good
enough,'' said Shanker. ``The problem is in the way you've
organized this whole thing, just as it wasn't the auto worker who
was laying down on the job. It was a stupid assembly line and a
rotten design of an automobile.''
   He called reform ``a life-and-death issue for American public
education, for our profession and for our union,''and suggested
that local unions and school boards try things like experimental
schools within schools.
   ``Nobody else is going to do it,'' he said. ``And if we don't do
it, a lot of the hard-won gains of collective bargaining are going
to be lost. We're going to be dismantled by breaking up the
districts.''
   ``The reform movement has raised very high expectations ... and
as those expectations are not realized _ which I do not believe
they will be ... there will be anger and backlash.''
   ``The threats are there,'' said Shanker, pointing to New
Jersey's recent move to take over the educationally bankrupt Jersey
City schools as well as efforts to create a separate district in
Milwaukee's inner city and continuing calls for vouchers that
parents could use in public or private schools.
   He said the dilemma was acute for the AFT, most of whose 670,000
members teach in big cities where public schools face the greatest
difficulties.
   ``Who's going to be in bankruptcy? It's going to be the urban
areas. It's not going to be most of the nice NEA (suburban)
districts,'' said Shanker.
   The Jersey City teachers actually belong to the rival National
Education Association, but Shanker said, ``Mostly it will be an AFT
problem.''
   Shanker said the National Assessment of Educational Progress has
shown 80 percent or more of the 17-year-olds still in school cannot
handle algebra or even write a simple, persuasive letter.
   AFT delegates will get a chance over the holiday weekend to
debate a resolution endorsing Shanker's call for widespread,
radical experimentation with new ways of running schools.
   Shanker said his aim is to get ``within the next two years more
than a thousand locations'' trying these new methods.
   Shanker said both teachers and students should work in teams,
with computers and technology allowing teachers to ``get away from
lecture and talk.''
   The reform resolution, backed by the AFT's 36-member Executive
Council, says that despite some gains, ``much that has happened as
a result of education reform ... is bad.''
   ``We are witnessing major efforts to de-skill and and
deprofessionalize teachers,'' it said. ``More and more teachers are
being told what to do, when to do it and how _ old-fashioned
`teacher-proofing' in the name of reform.''
   It adds, ``Teacher evaluation systems of the worst sorts have
proliferated _ `snoopervision' checklists ... that reduce teaching
to a simple and dubious formula.''
   The resolution would endorse Shanker's
let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom approach to reform, encouraging
bottom-up efforts by teachers in groups of six or more to form
schools within schools.
   They would get a pro-rated share of public school budgets and
freedom to try their experiment for at least five years, with
participation voluntary for both teachers and parents.
   Shanker also said he will seek to expand his union's political
muscle by recruiting parents and others to sign up as associate AFT
members.
   For $25 a year, these so-called ``Friends of Education'' would
attend conferences and receive its publications and other services,
but would not be able to vote on union affairs.
   Shanker predicted it would push AFT membership past 1 million.
   ``Politically it's very important. Politicians don't ask you
which category of members you have or where they work,' he said.
   The biennial AFT convention runs until Tuesday, when delegates
will hear addresses by satellite television from both Michael
Dukakis, the certain Democratic presidential nominee, and his only
rival, Jesse Jackson.
   Dukakis will also speak Tuesday via satellite from Boston to the
National Education Association convention, which opens Monday in
New Orleans.
   The NEA's board of directors gave a delayed primary endorsement
to Dukakis Friday, but the AFT is sticking with the AFL-CIO's plan
of making no endorsement until both parties hold their conventions.
But a dozen top AFT leaders, including Shanker, are Dukakis
delegates.

   Americans took to the open road on their way to the beaches,
parks, campgrounds, concerts, race tracks, rodeos and parades
Saturday for the Fourth of July weekend, but the fire hazard
created by the drought took fireworks off the program for many of
them.
   The weekend of partying under the summer sun opened with a
shiver for some people around the Great Lakes and in the East.
Temperatures dipped into the 30s and 40s overnight and two dozen
cities hit record lows, including 34 degrees at Elkins, W.Va.
   Outdoor concerts were a big part of the weekend festivities.
   In Maine, about 70,000 tickets were sold for concerts Saturday
and Sunday by the Grateful Dead at the Oxford Plains Speedway. The
band's followers, known as Deadheads, started arriving Friday to
camp out.
   ``This is the real American dream that sometimes gets lost,''
said Stephen Whitaker of Vermont, who characterized a Grateful Dead
concert as a unity of people. ``The specialness of why people have
been doing this for 20 years is the sense of caring.''
   Thousands more in Maine were expected to converge on Old Orchard
Beach on Sunday to hear Bob Dylan.
   Vice President George Bush was also in Maine, at his vacation
home in Kennebunkport, but aides said he planned no public
appearances and was scheduled to leave Monday.
   If rock wasn't your style, an annual Festival of American Fiddle
Tunes was scheduled at Washington's Fort Worden State Park.
   For those who preferred something more rousing, the New Mexico
Symphony Orchestra offered an outdoor pops concert Saturday evening
featuring Tchaikovsky's ``1812 Overture,'' accompanied by cannons
representing Napoleon's siege of Moscow.
   And there's always the Fourth of July outdoor concert by the
Boston Pops, with police expecting 200,000 people this year along
the Charles River.
   The Charlie Daniels Band joined in at Freedom Weekend Aloft, a
four-day hot-air balloon festival at Greenville, S.C. That event
opened Friday with 125 balloons taking off before an audience of
about 50,000 people. Going in the opposite direction at the opening
ceremony were members of the Army's parachute team, the Golden
Knights.
   Entertainers ranging from Glen Campbell to Chinese acrobats were
on the program in St. Louis, where organizers expected more than 3
million visitors for the annual VP Fair, billed as ``America's
largest birthday party.'' The three-day event kicked off Saturday
with a parade that drew 250,000 spectators.
   Big crowds were expected over the weekend at Gettysburg, Pa.,
for the final two days of festivities marking the 125th anniversary
of the Civil War battle, fought July 1-3, 1863. But only about
15,000 tourists spent at least part of the day at the battlefield
Friday, park officials said.
   During a ceremony Saturday, Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey,
Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, and U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New
York exchanged original flags from the period. The flags will be
displayed at the Gettysburg battlefield's museum.
   ``We remember the remarkable bravery of our soldiers, the
sacrifices of our families and the consequences for succeeding
generations of Americans,'' Baliles said. ``But let us only
remember the past, not become prisoners to it.''
   The weather was playing a large part in the weekend diversions.
   In Florida, rain and damp weather caused swarms of mosquitoes to
breed and southwest winds, unusual for this time of year, blew them
from the Everglades into populated areas by the millions.
   ``In many, many parts of Dade County we're experiencing landing
counts on human beings of 50 (mosquitoes) per minute,'' said Pat
O'Conner, Dade County's assistant director of public works.
   But elsewhere the problem was the widespread drought and its
heightened fire danger. Counties and communities in Iowa, Nebraska,
North Dakota, Wisconsin, Kentucky, California and elsewhere banned
or restricted fireworks out of fear of setting grass and forest
fires.
   ``The potential is there for a disaster this year,'' said Les
Parr, a Riverside County, Calif., fire prevention officer. ``The
brush is dry and well-cured and the danger and potential for fires
is a lot greater.''
   Some drought-stricken farmers got a little relief Saturday when
trucks carrying some 2,000 bales of Virginia hay arrived at
Coldwater, Ohio. The Virginia farmers were returning a favor
granted by their Ohio counterparts during a drought two years ago.
   Concern with fireworks safety wasn't limited to drought areas.
Fireworks were blamed for an apartment fire in the Seattle suburb
of Burien that left eight families homeless Friday. That was the
sixth fire in the Puget Sound area blamed on fireworks in the past
two weeks.
   On the competitive side of the weekend, the 8th annual run of
the World's Greatest Lizard Race is set for Monday at Lovington,
N.M. A separate race is scheduled for slower horned toads. The town
also scheduled an egg toss, cowchip toss and drill-bit toss.
   And a Fourth of July church picnic at Oak Ridge, Tenn., will
feature a wrestling match between Tom ``Powerhouse Parson''
Melzoni, ordinarily the pastor of Central Baptist Church, and Chris
``Masked Saint'' Whaley, a divinity student who wrestles
professionally.

<HEAD>Some In Atlanta Suburb Offended By Magazine's `Redneck' Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some folks in this northwest Atlanta suburb
aren't taking too kindly to being called ``redneck'' by National
Geographic.
   In a story about Atlanta in the magazine's July issue, Erla
Zwingle writes of the city's relative youth: ``No matter where I
went, from redneck Smyrna in the northwest to downtown's black
Atlanta University to the old-money bastions of Ansley Park,
Atlantans described their town indulgently as `adolescent.'''
   Former Smyrna Mayor Harold Smith, president of the Smyrna
Historical Society, is spearheading an effort to get the magazine
to apologize.
   ``If the lady had said some people refer to Smyrna as a `redneck
area,' that would be one thing,'' Smith said Saturday. ``But to
categorize our whole town as `redneck' just burned me up.''
   Smith has drafted a resolution of complaint, pointing out that
Smyrna is a booming business center, with corporate headquarters,
major shopping centers and industrial parks, and says that
``redneck'' is ``as derogatory as ... racial slurs ... you
certainly would not print.''
   The Optimist Club of Smyrna passed the resolution Friday, and
Smith plans to present it to the City Council at its next meeting
Tuesday.
   Smith, a subscriber to National Geographic for more than a
decade, said he was especially disappointed in the source.
   ``You might expect it from the (National) Enquirer, but you do
not expect it from National Geographic _ to let a writer
characterize a town like that,'' he said.
   Calls to the Maryland home of National Geographic Society
spokeswoman Mary Jeanne Jacobsen went unanswered Saturday afternoon.
   Ms. Zwingle, who lives in New York, told the Marietta Daily
Journal on Friday that she didn't mean to offend anyone, saying she
had heard many people in Smyrna call the town ``redneck.''
   ``I am sorry to think that someone is upset by something I
wrote,'' she said, adding that she was attempting to show ``the
variety in Atlanta.''
   The writer added that to her, ``redneck'' conveys ``obviously
something rural, the country versus the city'' and an ``educational
level ... a rather limited view of the world.''
   ``I am sure there are some people in very nice homes in nice
sections of Atlanta who share these attributes,'' she said.

   A U.S. warship fired a warning shot near
one of three Iranian gunboats that attacked a Danish-flagged
supertanker in the southern Persian Gulf on Saturday, a Pentagon
spokesman said.
   It was the first time a U.S. warship has gone to the aid of a
non-U.S. flagged tanker since Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci
announced in April that such assistance would be provided when
requested, Lt. Col. Arnold Williams said in Washington.
   The challenge came hours after Iraqi warplanes attacked two
Iranian tankers, shattering a nearly three-week lull in the gulf's
``tanker war.''
   Williams said the USS Elmer Montgomery, patrolling the area,
responded to a distress assistance request from the tanker at 7:10
p.m. (12:10 p.m. EDT). The tanker was identified by gulf shipping
sources as the 337,733-ton Karama Maersk which they said was
carrying Saudi Arabian crude oil.
   ``The tanker reported being under attack from three small
Iranian gunboats,'' Williams said. ``By the time the Montgomery got
into range, twoof the gunboats had left. One was still in the
vicinity. The Montgomery fired a warning shot and the boat
departed.''
   Williams said there were no injuries, damage or casualties to
the tanker or American warship. He said the incident occurred about
13 miles south of Abu Musa island.
   The shipping sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the island, 30 miles north of the coast of the United Arab Emirates
in the southwest gulf, is fortified by Iranian gunboats.
   The tanker continued on its course south toward the Strait of
Hormuz and the Elmer Montgomery resumed its normal patrol,
according to Williams.
   Shipping sources said the tanker would have cleared the strait
by midnight (5 p.m. EDT).
   Radio reports during the incident were monitored by gulf
shipping companies. At one point, the U.S. frigate radioed: ``Small
craft in the area. You are standing in danger. Please clear the
area.'' That apparently was addressed to the gunboats but it was
not clear.
   Later the Elmer Mongomery radioed the Karama Maersk and asked
for an assessment of the situation. The tanker's reply was, ``We
have no casualties. We have not discovered any damage.''
   Then the frigate advised the tanker, ``I will remain with you
until further directed'' and received the response, ``Roger U.S.
warship. We appreciate your assistance.''
   U.S. military sources in the gulf who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that in following the Navy's rules of engagement,
the Elmer Montgomery confirmed with the captain of the Karama
Maersk that his ship was not carrying war-related materials.
   In July last year U.S. warships began escorting 11 Kuwaiti oil
tankers that were reflagged with the American flag.
   In the northern gulf, salvage tugboats battled flames Saturday
aboard the two Iranian supertankers. They were hit as they sailed
south from the Kharg island loading terminal, according to shipping
executives.
   No casualties were reported.
   The tankers were still burning 12 hours after the attacks late
Friday and early Saturday, said the shipping sources. The two
tankers had been attacked at least seven times in the last 18
months.
   Elsewhere in the Iran-Iraq war, the official Iraqi news agency
said Saturday that its forces had recaptured seven mountain heights
along the northern border.
   The gulf had been quiet since mid-June, with action in the
nearly 8-year-old war concentrated on battlefields along the
730-mile frontier, where Iraq's forces have scored a series of
major victories in the last three months.
   Baghdad had not claimed a tanker raid since June 10, and Iran's
last known gunboat sortie was an attack on the Singapore-flagged
Neptune Subaru on June 14 in the northern gulf.
   An Iraqi communique monitored in Nicosia on Saturday said
warplanes scored ``direct and effective hits'' on two ``large
maritime targets'' shortly before and just after midnight.
   The Iraqis have been attacking tankers carrying Iranian oil
since 1984.
   The gulf-based executives identified the ships as the
268,081-ton Greek-owned Fortuneship L, under charter to Iran, and
the 284,299-ton Khark 4, one of the Tehran government's fleet.
   Records show the Khark 4 was the victim of Iraqi raids on Feb.
17, Sept. 29, Oct. 21 and Nov. 29 of last year, and the Fortuneship
L was hit Aug. 30, Nov. 11 and Nov. 12, 1987.
   With Iraq's ports closed since the early days of the war, the
Iranians attack neutral merchant ships, mainly those serving Kuwait
or Saudi Arabia. Tehran claims the two countries are aiding
Baghdad's war effort.
   More than 500 ships have been attacked by both sides in the
``tanker war,'' with more than 300 sailors killed.
   Iran's armed craft have carried out three attacks since May 27
and apparently have made a special effort to avoid U.S. warships
now permitted to intervene in attacks on commercial ships,
regardless of what flag they fly.

   It takes not one but three Elvis Presley
impersonators to depict the king of rock 'n' roll in a new musical
depicting his life and times.
   The multimedia show ``Elvis: An American Musical'' premiered
Friday night at the Las Vegas Hilton, the resort where the late
entertainer was a top attraction in the late 1960s and early '70s.
   The show, which was developed in association with the Presley
estate, is an elaborate mixture of old movie footage, video and
live performances.
   Among the 40 cast members are three impersonators who depict
Presley at various times of his life _ as a teen-ager getting
started in Memphis, Tenn., as a young man at the height of his
career, and as an older Elvis in the closing years.
   The three sing 40 of the songs made famous by Presley from the
time he graduated from high school in 1953 until his death in
August 1977.
   The show is interspersed with film clips depicting the times of
the entertainer, ranging from racial segregation in the South to
the civil rights unrest, Vietnam War, peace protests and the
assassination of Robert Kennedy.
   There are also clips of Elvis himself, including the famous
appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, where he first gained national
stardom in the mid-'50s.
   The show ends with film of Presley's funeral cortege and
newscaster David Brinkley proclaiming ``he changed our lives. He
changed the way teen-agers thought about America.''
   The cortege was followed by a montage of Presley and other rock
'n' roll stars for whom he paved the way.
   Among those attending Friday night's premiere were singer Robert
Goulet.
   The show runs through Aug. 28 at the Las Vegas resort, where
Presley established attendance records from 1969 to 1977.

<HEAD>New Law Restores Drunken Drivers' Licenses Earlier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law restored Colorado driver's licenses to
530 convicted drunken drivers in time for the Fourth of July
weekend.
   The law, which went into effect Friday, says that first-offense
drunken drivers whose licenses had been revoked for at least four
months could apply to get their driving privileges back immediately.
   For those convicted of drunken driving in the future, the
license revocation period for a first offense will be three months.
   The revocation period had been one year.
   The chance for an early return to the road, before their year
was up, drew hundreds of people to the Denver Motor Vehicle
Division office even before it opened Friday.
   ``We processed 214 in less than two hours,'' said Richard
Georgeson, state driver control section chief. ``The line was
outside and around the block.''
   ``It makes me sick,'' said state Rep. Scott McInnis, a former
policeman who opposed the amendment making the shorter revocation
period retroactive. ``Putting 500 convicted drunken drivers behind
the wheel sooner than they should _ it's definitely a step
backward.''
   The new law aims to toughen drunken-driving enforcement by
reducing the legal blood-alcohol threshold defining drunkenness
from 0.15 to 0.10 percent. Amendments attached to the bill
shortened the license revocation period and provided for the
shorter period to apply retroactively.
   The bill's original sponsor, Sen. Jim Lee, said he didn't like
the idea of reducing the revocation period for first offenders
retroactively. However, he said, studies show that very few first
offenders go on to become multiple offenders.

   Leonard Matlovich, a Vietnam War hero whose
1975 discharge from the Air Force for his avowed homosexuality
became a rallying point for gay rights activists, was buried here
Saturday with full military honors.
   Matlovich, 44, died June 22 in Los Angeles, from complications
associated with AIDS, a fatal virus-borne disease whose chief
victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers.
   He was buried in Congressional Cemetery just 20 blocks from the
U.S. Capitol in a ceremony that mixed the military pomp of a
horse-drawn caisson and a traditional three-volley salute by seven
riflemen with eulogies from gay rights activists.
   ``The Air Force finally did it right and on Leonard's terms
today,'' said Frank Kameny, a Washington gay rights activist who
was instrumental in counseling Matlovich on testing the military's
ban on homosexuality.
   ``It's a pity that they didn't do it 13 years ago,'' Kameny said
as an Air Force color guard departed the cemetery.
   Matlovich, who was awarded a Purple Heart after stepping on a
Viet Cong land mind and the Bronze Star for killing two Viet Cong
soldiers attacking his post, first challenged the Air Force's rules
on homosexuality in 1975.
   At the time, he was a technical sergeant working as a drug and
alcohol abuse counselor at Langley Air Force Base outside
Washington with nearly 12 years of service.
   ``After some years of uncertainty I have arrived at the
conclusion that my sexual preferences are homosexual as opposed to
heterosexual,'' Matlovich said in a memorandum to his commanding
officer. ``I have also concluded that my sexual preference will in
no way interfere with my Air Force duties.''
   Following a hearing, Matlovich was given a general discharge
from the service. His challenge of the action in court put his face
on the cover of Time magazine, and in 1980 the Air Force was
ordered to reinstate him with back pay.
   Months later, Matlovich and the Air Force reached an
out-of-court settlement in which he was paid a total of $160,000 in
back pay and other compensation and given an honorable discharge.
   ``When Leonard lived in the neighborhood, he would come over
here and walk,'' Lee Jenny, the administrator of the cemetery where
many members of the nation's first Congresses are buried, recalled
Saturday. ``He loved the history. He was one of the most patriotic
men I ever met.''
   Ms. Jenny helped design the tombstone that Matlovich wanted for
his grave as a memorial to gay and lesbian Vietnam veterans. It is
located on a plot less than 20 yards from where former FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover and Hoover's longtime associate and friend, Clyde
Tolson, are buried.
   Matlovich's tombstone includes in the top corners pink triangles
that were used by Nazis during World War II to identify homosexuals
in concentration camps and that have since been adopted as a symbol
in the gay rights struggle.
   Under the triangles is the inscription:
   ``A Gay Vietnam Veteran''
   ``When I was in the military they gave me a medal for killing
two men and a discharge for loving one.''

<HEAD>Third Human-Rights Lawyer Killed In Manila</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen on Saturday assassinated a
human-rights lawyer at a busy intersection near the presidential
palace. He was the third human-rights lawyer killed in the
Philippines in two weeks.
   A nationwide coalition of civil rights groups condemned the
killing and suggested police or the military might be behind the
attacks.
   Emmanuel Mendoza, 57, was killed as his car was stopped at an
intersection about a half a mile from the palace, according to
police.
   Two men on a motorcycle opened fire on Mendoza, police Cpl.
Porfirio Olais said. The lawyer was taken to a nearby hospital
where he died an hour later, police and hospital authorities said.
   Mendoza was killed two days after a close associate, Nemesio
Prudente, survived an assassination attempt in the same area. It
was the second attempt on Prudente's life.
   Mendoza was a professor at the state-run Polytechnic University
of the Philippines, where Prudente is president.
   On June 18, gunmen killed human-rights lawyer Ramon Cura in his
home near the U.S. Clark Air Base north of Manila. A colleague,
Alfonso Surigao, was shot and killed in his residence in the
central island of Cebu last week.
   Mendoza was a legal counsel of the left-wing People's Party-PNB
and chairman of the Manila Solidarity Alliance, a federation of
slum residents' groups in the capital.
   The secretary-general of the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights
Advocates, Redempto Anda, said Mendoza may have been killed because
he represented slum residents whose communities were being raided
by police in search of communist rebels.
   ``This series of killings has victimized personalities who have
been associated with the legal left,'' the alliance said in a
statement.
   ``That this could go on without the government being able to
solve any single case raises the strong possibilities that certain
segments of the police and the military could be involved in
them,'' the statement said.
   Cura was the lawyer of jailed communist leader Rodolfo Salas,
while Surigao was a chapter president of Amnesty International in
the central Philippine island grouping called Visayas.
   Surigao and Mendoza were both defeated candidates in last year's
congressional elections.
   Prudente, a human rights activist, has been accused by the
military and police of using his school to shelter communist
guerillas. Prudente has denied the allegation.
   President Corazon Aquino has ordered an investigation into the
attempts on Prudente's.
   Investigators have yet to publish their findings on the first
attempted ambush of Prudente in November 1987.
   Human rights groups blamed rightist death squads for that
attempted assassination, which occured a week after soldiers and
policemen chanted ``Kill Prudente!'' during a funeral for a police
captain and three other people killed by communist gunmen in the
capital.
   Security forces have been fighting communist guerrillas since
1969.

<HEAD>Former Governer Says Sanctions on Panama Destroying Middle Class</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee including U.S. lawmakers
from the Democratic Party urged the Reagan administration Saturday
to end sanctions against Panama, saying the measures are destroying
that country's middle class.
   Patrick J. Lucey, former governor of Wisconsin and ambassador to
Mexico during the Carter administration, called the sanctions ``an
unloaded gun pointed at Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.'' Noriega is
the commander of Panama's Defense Forces and controls the civilian
government.
   Lucey called on President Reagan to appoint a special envoy to
examine the situation first-hand and to recommend changes in ``what
is clearly a policy gone awry.''
   Lucey and four other members of the ``July 4th Emergency
Committee for Justice in Panama'' issued a report in San Jose
following a three-day visit to Panama that ended Friday night.
   The report said the sanctions were devastating the private
business sector and causing suffering among workers who lost their
jobs because of private business closings.
   ``Thus U.S. policy is leading thousands of Panamanian workers to
view private enterprise as less attractive than working for the
government,'' the report said.
   Washington imposed economic sanctions on Panama earlier this
year in an attempt to force Noriega out of office following his
indictments by federal grand juries in Florida last February that
accused the general of drug trafficking.
   Lucey is the founder and one of three co-chairmen of the
committee for justice in Panama. Another co-chairman is George
McGovern, a former Democratic senator and presidential candidate
from South Dakota.
   Lucey is pledged as a delegate to Michael Dukakis and has worked
actively in the Massachusetts governor's presidential campaign for
the Democratic nomination. He denied, however, that his committee
was tied to either the Dukakis campaign or the Democratic National
Committee.
   He said his group proposed no solutions and its mission was ``to
assess the damage caused by the sanctions to the Panamanian
economy, to the Panamanian social structure, to the Panamanian
people and to U.S.-Panamanian relations.''
   The report said the committee ``strongly supports the objective
of seeing that Gen. Noriega ... is brought to justice,'' but
economic sanctions have left him firmly in power.
   It also claimed the sanctions were forcing Panamanian importers
to seek supply channels other than the United States, leading to
closer ties between Panama and ``opportunistic Arab countries'' as
well as Japan.
   Other committee members include Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D-Wis.)
and three Democratic state legislators from Colorado: Philip A.
Fernandez, Tony Hernandez and Robert Martinez.

   A coast guard helicopter on Saturday
rescued four Icelanders from a yacht in heavy seas off the remote
Outer Hebrides Islands of western Scotland, the coast guard
reported.
   The 28-foot yacht radioed a distress call after it lost its life
raft and much of its gear in wind-whipped seas, said Jim Budge of
the Stornoway coast guard.
   He said rescuers dropped from the helicopter and lifted the four
Icelanders off the yacht one by one about 45 miles northwest of St.
Kilda in the Hebrides.
   A French trawler had responded to the yacht's distress call but
was unable to rescue the crew because of the storm, according to
Budge.
   He said the Icelanders had been headed for home from the
Scottish island of Coll. He did not have the name of the vessel.

<HEAD>Jane Fonda, Robert DeNiro to Appear at Agent-Orange Benefit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Jane Fonda, who has recently
tried to pacify veterans still angry over her 1972 trip to Hanoi,
will appear at a benefit for children with birth defects linked to
Agent Orange, a veterans group announced Saturday.
   Fonda, whose plans to film part of a movie in Waterbury later
this summer sparked protests by some veterans, apologized on
national television last month for posing for photos on a North
Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun during her 1972 trip and for saying
prisoners of war were lying about having been tortured.
   Money raised at the July 29 benefit will go to the Brandy Schieb
Children's Fund, a project of the Stamford-based Vietnam Veterans
Victims of Agent Orange, said the Rev. John A. McColley, rector of
St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Naugatuck and a Vietnam veteran.
   Actor Robert De Niro is also slated to attend the benefit,
organizers said.
   Fonda and De Niro are slated to appear in the movie, ``Union
Street,'' about a working-class woman fighting her way up the
social ladder who teaches an illiterate man to read.
   Holyoke, Mass., and Waterbury were chosen as filming locations
because of their industrial look. But there were protests by
veterans in both towns after the plans for the film were announced.
   The day after the apology was broadcast on ABC's ``20-20'' news
program, Fonda met at St. Michael's with about 25 Vietnam veterans
from Connecticut and Massachusetts. The benefit ``grew out of the
spirit of reconciliation and good'' exhibited during the meeting,
McColley said.
   ``Afterward, a lot of us were standing around saying wouldn't it
be great if now we could all do something together,'' he said.
   The event is being sponsored by a group of Vietnam veterans
calling themselves Veterans Who Care, which includes some of
Fonda's former and present critics, McColley said.
   Exact details of the benefit were not all worked out, but
activities may include a booth where people can get their pictures
taken with Fonda and De Niro, said Stephen Rivers, a Fonda
spokesman.
   ``Jane spoke to De Niro last night and called me to confirm that
he was on board as well,'' Rivers said.

<TEXT>
   Rates on international telephone calls
have been increased an average 700 percent and on national calls
300 percent, the Sandinista newspaper Barricada reported Saturday.
   Anastasio Gonzalez, vice minister of the Telecommmunications and
Mail Institute, told the newspaper a three-minute call to the
United States, Mexico or Canada that cost 240 cordobas until
Thursday now is 1,920 cordobas.
   The increase would be from $3 to $24 at the official rate of 80
cordobas to the U.S. dollar. On the black market a dollar sells for
more than 300 cordobas.
   Gonzalez said the monthly telephone rate was increased from 200
to 800 cordobas, or from $2.50 to $10 at the official rate.
   The rates, which took effect Friday, follow economic measures
announced June 14 that included devaluation of the cordoba from 10
per dollar to 80.
   Bank interests were increased and salaries boosted 30 percent.
Government controls on salaries of industrial workers were lifted
and prices freed.

   Pat Robertson received a hero's welcome
Saturday from Washington State Republicans, as the party now
dominated by the television evangelist's followers adopted a
conservative platform including support for South Africa's
government.
   ``You have won a great victory in Washington and I am proud of
you,'' Robertson said to his supporters, who swept the state's
precinct caucuses in March.
   His campaign may be over for now, ``but ideals and principals
never lose,'' Robertson said. ``I have no intention of quitting.
We're going to keep coming back.''
   Robertson's loyal army of supporters, which plans to give the
television evangelist his largest block of delegates to the
national GOP convention, went wild as he addressed the convention.
   Robertson told his backers they must shift their loyalties to
the party's certain nominee, George Bush, and help elect all
Republican candidates this fall. He called it part of a long-term
strategy of converting America to conservatism.
   Robertson picked up 38 of Washington's delegates to the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans. Of the state's
remaining three delegates, one went to Bush and the other two were
uncommitted.
   The vice president addressed the convention via telephone from
his home in Maine, saying, ``We'll come out of the New Orleans
convention (united) to go to fight right down to the wire.''
   Robertson told a news conference he'll stump the country for
Bush, particularly in the states where the television evangelist
did best. He termed himself ``pleased with the conservative
principals the vice president is enunciating,'' and said Bush
should pick Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas for his
rinning mate.
   ``Bob Dole would be my choice,'' he said.
   In addition to hearing Robertson, the convention adopted a
conservative platform, including support for South Africa.
   The plank on South Africa read: ``We continue to support the
South African government in its efforts to eliminate apartheid and
oppose economic sanctions.''
   The platform, less than five pages long, reads like a compendium
of conservative thought. It is against gay rights, a state income
tax, abortion, the United Nations, and school health clinics, and
for the deployment Strategic Defense Initiative of space-based
weapons, Contra aid ``everywhere,'' prayer in the schools and more
nuclear development.
   The convention, which opened Friday, has combined elemens of
politics, the circus and a prayer meeting.
   The convention hall was festooned in red, white and blue, with
huge pictures of President Reagan flanking a gigantic American
flag. The crowd cheered when ``Uncle Sam'' rode a huge elephant
into the convention from the circus next door.
   There was prayer, amens, a fervent, hymn-like singing of ``God
Bless America'' and frequent invocation of God's name.
   At one point state GOP chairwoman Jennifer Dunn called for
Attorney General Ken Eikenberry to come up to the podium and
``address the congregation.''

   A 2,500-gallon gasoline tank ruptured and
exploded in flames outside a restaurant Saturday, injuring at least
six people, one critically, authorities said.
   The tank outside Que's Place Restaurant, three miles north of
here, sprang a leak and burst into flames about 3:45 p.m., said
Darrell Cook of the Miller County Sheriff's Department.
   Cook said that based on estimates from officers at the scene,
about 20 people were injured in the accident, but officials at two
hospitals said they treated only six people.
   David Kopriva, 30, of Eldon was flown to the University of
Missouri Hospital in Columbia, said Sgt. Jim Glover of the Missouri
State Water Patrol. He was reported in critical condition with
third-degree burns over 55 percent of his body.
   Dorothy Collins, nursing supervisor at Lake Ozark General
Hospital, said two children were admitted to that hospital: Lauren
E. Wimmer, 10, and Shawn Neville, 12, both of Belleville, Ill. Both
were listed in stable condition.
   Three other people were treated and released from the hospital,
she said.
   Glover said the explosion occurred after a worker began filling
a gasoline tank near the restaurant and noticed that a seam had
broken and gasoline was spilling onto the ground.
   ``The worker went down and advised someone at the restaurant,
and they started to evacuate the area,'' he said.
   The gasoline ignited near the edge of Lake of the Ozarks after
the evacuation was in progress and most of the people were out of
the restaurant, Glover said. Seconds later, there was an explosion.
   ``The restaurant and the dock it was on and five boats were
destroyed in the explosion and resulting fire,'' Glover said. He
said he did not know what caused the explosion.
   A number of people were found in the water after the explosion,
but it was not known whether they were blown into the water by the
force of the blast or if they had jumped, he said.
   Damage from the fire, which was contained about an hour later,
were estimated at more than $100,000, Glover said.
   Lake of the Ozarks is a popular resort attraction in central
Missouri.

   A team of 22 Soviet on-site inspectors was
welcomed here by schoolchildren and residents Saturday, arriving to
begin monitoring compliance with the treaty to eliminate
medium-range nuclear missiles.
   The inspectors will monitor the Hercules Aerospace Co. missile
plant in Magna, Utah, where Pershing II missiles banned under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty were produced.
   A group of U.S. inspectors arrived in the Soviet Union on Friday
under the treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in December.
   The 22 Soviet missile experts and linguists arrived at the Utah
Air National Guard field at the Salt Lake International Airport
aboard an Air Force C-141 cargo plane at about 3 p.m.
   The Soviet team was part of a contingent of 70 missile
specialists who arrived at Travis Air Force Base in California on
Friday night.
   The inspectors assigned to the Hercules plant will be the only
permanently based Soviets, who can stay for up to 13 years under
the terms of the treaty.
   Early Sunday, the 48 other inspectors were to leave the air base
to conduct spot checks at as many as five missile sites in
California, Utah, Colorado and Arizona.
   A U.S. team, meanwhile, has arrived in the Soviet city of
Votkinsk, the site of a plant that formerly built the SS-20
missiles, the most important Soviet weapon to be eliminated under
the treaty.
   The Soviets arriving in Utah were greeted by a small group of
local residents, including about a dozen Magna elementary school
children, who held signs reading ``Welcome to Magna.''
   Speaking through an interpreter, Anatoly Samarin, the leader of
the inspection team, said the time had come to effect the terms of
the treaty to eliminate Soviet and U.S. intermediate missiles.
   ``It is generally accepted that the INF Treaty is an important
stage in the relations between our two countries, a first step
towards the saving of mankind from the threat of nuclear
annhilation,'' he said in a brief, prepared statement.
   ``We should not be cynical or euphoric aboutthis process,'' said
Marine Col. George Connell of the On-Site Inspection Agency. ``It's
not the millenium, but it is an important step in the peace
process.''
   The Soviets mingled briefly with the children, shaking hands and
passing out Russian pocket calendars before boarding a bus to their
apartments in suburban Salt Lake City, where they will stay there
until quarters are built for them in Magna.
   The all-male contingent traveled to the Utah without wives and
families. They will be rotatd periodically with other Soviets, but
Kirk Van Leeuwen, logistics manager for the OSIA, said the schedule
will be up to the Soviets.
   The apartment building where the Soviets are staying has been
restricted and is off-limits to the news media, Van Leeuwen said.
``They asked for privacy just to unload,'' he said. ``They`re
tired.''
   The ``baseline inspections'' to be conducted within the next two
months are designed to verify the exact number of missiles and
related components to be destroyed under the treaty.
   The Soviet inspectors arrived with a 10-member air crew aboard
an Aeroflot jetliner at Travis on Friday, the same day 20 American
inspectors left for Moscow and Votkinsk.
   At the Magna plant, which made Pershing missile rocket motors,
the Soviets have the right to monitor the plant's gates for up to
13 years. The U.S. may station inspectors for the same period at a
Votkinsk plant that formerly built the SS-20 missiles, the most
important Soviet weapon to be eliminted under the treaty.
   The Soviets were scheduled to announce late Saturday which of
the five sites they will visit to conduct the baseline spot checks.
The five are a General Dynamics Corp. plant in San Diego; the
Army's Dugway Proving Ground in western Utah; the Pueblo Army Depot
in Pueblo, Colo.; Fort Huachuca, Ariz.; and Davis-Monthan Air Force
Base near Tucson, Ariz.
   Altogther, there are 26 missile sites in the U.S. and Western
Europe and 133 sites in the Soviet Union, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia that are open to inspection under the treaty.
   The INF pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is

which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons
by 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicated

   Four men accused of illegally selling
millions of dollars worth of cable television and satellite
descramblers have been following a two-year FBI investigation.
   Howard Pirofsky, 43, and Jack Pirofsky, 37, both of Clifton
Park, Edward Zibro III, 34, of Cohoes, and Mark Fournier, 36, of
Troy, pleaded innocent at their arraignments Thursday and were
released on their own recognizance.
   The illegal sale and manufacture of descramblers is a
misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in prison and a $10,000
fine.
   Officials said the illegal sales ring was among the largest in
the country, and sold the components in the United States, Canada,
Puerto Rico and New Guinea.
   ``Indications are that this one is one of the largest, if not
the largest,'' said Jim Allen, director of the Office of Cable
Signal Theft, based at the National Cable Television Association in
Washington.
   Descramblers decode signals to certain cable television pay
channels, allowing viewers to watch the channels without paying for
them.
   Allen said the typical user saved between $30 and $40 a month,
which otherwise would have been paid to so-called ``premium'' pay
channels. Allen said the industry loses $250 million annually to
descrambling pirates.
   Also named in the 86-count indictment were six corporations run
by the men under the names P.G. Video Corp., State Satellite Corp.,
Starview Inc., Sone Associates, Consumer Video Corp. and Trend
Video Corp., according to Frederick Scullin, U.S. attorney for the
northern district of New York.
   The ring allegedly operated between January 1984 and August
1986, violating federal laws that outlaw the manufacture,
distribution and use of cable descramblers by unauthorized
individuals, FBI and federal prosecutors said.
   Descramblers can be sold legally to authorized individuals such
as cable television companies.

   Police fatally shot a suspected guerrilla and
captured another as insurgents bombed three gasoline stations
Saturday, authorities said.
   Police said the pro-Cuban guerrillas from the Tupac Amaru
revolutionary movement staged the attacks to protest a recent 58
percent increase in fuel prices, raising the price of gasoline to
84 cents a gallon.
   The guerrilla group, which has been active since 1984,
frequently launches attacks to protest government policies.
   Police said the rebels ordered attendants away at gunpoint at
all three gas stations and then blew up gas pumps and offices with
dynamite.
   Firefighters and attendants extinguished the fires before flames
reached gas storage tanks, police said.
   Groups of three or four attackers fled in cars from each
station, located in widespread areas of the city, police said. When
one band was intercepted by a squad car, a gunfight ensued that
left one guerrilla dead, they said, adding that another guerrilla
was captured and the rest escaped.

<HEAD>Government Campaign Aims To Destroy Domestic Marijuana Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration will renew and
expand its campaign to destroy the nation's illegal marijuana crop
beginning July 11 in an effort to combat domestic production that
has doubled in recent years, a Justice Department spokesman said
Saturday night.
   Robert Feldkamp, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said the campaign against the U.S. marijuana crop,
known as ``Operation Stop Crop,'' this summer will involve
additional personnel at the federal, state and local levels.
   Feldkamp said that in earlier years, about 5 percent to 10
percent of the marijuana used in the United States was grown
domestically, but now the amount of home-grown marijuana has
increased to 20 percent.
   He said the DEA is providing $4 million in seed money to start
up the latest eradication effort.
   The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that
``Operation Stop Crop,'' to be formally announced by Attorney
General Edwin Meese III on July 11, is being described as the
nation's most extensive effort to eradicate domestic marijuana.
   The campaign will include stepped-up deployment of National
Guard troops and helicopters, a toll-free number to encourage
citizen informers and expanded undercover surveillance aimed at
``immobilizing'' and prosecuting major growers, the Post said,
quoting government officials and documents.
   The Post said there were no figures on the total costs of the
operation but estimated that federal agencies, primarily DEA, the
Interior Department and the Agriculture Department, will spend
about $8 million on the campaign, with additional funds contributed
by participating state and local agencies.
   In addition, the newspaper said, administration sources said
last week they are recommending a doubling of funds for marijuana
suppression efforts as part of a domestic marijuana ``national
strategy'' recently adopted by the National Drug Policy Board.

   Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the government's
Institutional Revolutionary Party ended his presidential campaign
Saturday with a pledge to modernize Mexico's political and economic
structures.
   ``I am committed to change,'' Salinas de Gortari told throngs of
people from throughout the country gathered at the historic Zocalo
Plaza in downtown Mexico City. ``We must modernize to create a
stronger and sovereign Mexico,'' he said.
   Police estimated the crowd at more than 250,000 while organizers
claimed the rally was the largest in their party's history and said
as many as 700,000 people attended.
   Presidential and congressional elections will be held Wednesday.
   Many of the people at the rally were peasants and labor union
members bused into Mexico City the night before by party organizers.
   Manuel Clouthier, presidential candidate of the opposition
National Action Party (PAN), also closed his campaign with a late
afternoon rally at the Zocalo.
   A crowd estimated by reporters at about 140,000 people gathered
for the windup of the PAN campaign.
   The third major contender in the presidential race is Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, backed by the National Democratic Front that includes
several leftist parties. Cardenas packed the Zocalo last Saturday
with a similar rally.
   During Salinas de Gortari's speech, the colonial four-story
buldings on both sides of the Plaza were draped with large pictures
of Mexico's revolutionary heroes.
   ``During the campaign you have showed me what to change, what
not to change and how to carry out the changes,'' said the
candidate whose party has been in power for 60 years.
   He promised to eliminate inflation, advance economic development
with the help of private industry and pull Mexico out of its
economic crisis.
   ``We will forge a Mexico our children will be proud of,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury investigating the
Coca-Cola's dealings with the Soviet Union has subpoenaed the
records of a trading partner in the deal, an official of the
partner company said.
   New York-based Satra Corp. has delivered the records, Satra
Chairman Ara Oztemel said in a story published Saturday in joint
editions of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution.
   He said he did not know the focus of the probe.
   The newspapers said the Atlanta grand jury is investigating
Coca-Cola for possible illegal activity under the 1977 Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies and
individuals from bribing foreigners or political parties, in
connection with its 1986 agreement to sell Coke in the Soviet Union.
   Coca-Cola has denied any wrongdoing.
   ``I'd like to think they will not find anything,'' Oztemel said
in a telephone interview with the newspapers from his company's
London offices. ``They are wasting valuable time, mostly theirs.''
   Since Soviet law prohibits foreign companies from selling
products for cash and taking the money out of the country,
Coca-Cola and Satra have a three-way deal.
   Under the agreement, Satra buys Soviet-made Lada automobiles to
sell in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Russians then use the
British currency to buy Coke concentrate made at Coke's plants in
Ireland.

   Yegor K. Ligachev, the No. 2 man in the Kremlin,
provided an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the
Soviet leadership with his description of the events that brought
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to power.
   Ligachev said Friday at the Communist Party conference that
Gorbachev had crucial support from himself, Andrei A. Gromyko and
KGB chief Viktor G. Chebrikov when he became party general
secretary in March 1985. Gromyko, now president, was foreign
minister at the time.
   Ligachev, recounting emotions and experiences in a manner rare
for a member of the traditionally stoic party Politburo, disputed
claims from ousted Moscow Communist Party boss Boris N. Yeltsin
that he had slowed reform.
   He said he had been deeply worried about the fate of the country
during the final days of Leonid I. Brezhnev, who ruled from 1964 to
1982 in a ``time of stagnation.''

   The commander of Soviet troops in Afghanistan said
they served with honor and were not defeated, but two influential
officials criticized the decision to intervene in the fight against
U.S.-backed rebels.
   ``We came to Afghanistan not to win battles, but to defend women
and children, villages and cities. And we have performed our duty
with honor,'' Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov told the national Communist
Party conference on Friday.
   The Red Army entered in Afghanistan in December 1979, and more
than 100,000 troops were helping the Marxist government fight the
Moslem guerrillas until a withdrawal agreement was signed in April.
   Gromov, who told reporters this week that the Red Army is no
longer taking active part in the fighting, rejected claims that the
Soviet force was beaten.
   Grigory Baklanov, editor of the literary journal Znamya, said
the decision to intervene was made ``in defiance of the machinery
of democracy.'' He said some non-voting members of the ruling
Politburo learned about the decision only by reading the newspapers.

   People who received unsolicited pornography
sparked an investigation that authorities said resulted in federal
charges against companies responsible for much of the country's
sexually oriented mailings.
   Indictments unsealed Friday in eight states charged 20 people
and 14 companies under a section of federal law that makes it a
crime to use the mails for advertising or distributing obscene
material.
   ``Project Postporn,'' the official moniker for the Justice
Department-Postal Service probe, specifically targeted hard-core
pornography, which depicts actual sexual acts.
   Mailings usually arrived at homes addressed to adults, children
or simply ``resident,'' said Brent Ward, U.S. attorney for Utah and
chairman of the attorney general's subcommittee on obscenity.
   ``They arrive unsolicited in innocuous-looking envelopes in the
homes of unsuspecting people who have never subscribed to
pornography, do not want it in their homes and are never going to
order any obscene material,'' Ward said at a Justice Department
news conference Friday.

   Despite rising teacher pay, the president
of the American Federation of Teachers warns that rough days lie
ahead for public schools unless there are radical changes in the
nation's education system.
   Albert Shanker said he would deliver that message in his keynote
address today to 3,000 AFT delegates at the start of their biennial

   Shanker's union released a report Friday that indicated U.S.
teacher salaries are at a record high _ $28,085 on average in
1987-88 _ and starting pay is up to $18,557 on average.
   But Shanker, an outspoken critic of traditional school
structures, argues that schools fail to deliver an adequate
education to 80 percent of all students. He recently proposed
allowing groups of six to 12 teachers experiment with running their
own schools-within-schools.
   He said in an interview that if teachers don't take the lead in
persuading the public to restructure schools, ``we're going to end
up being dismantled out of existence.''

   The Justice Department failed to keep up with
defense procurement fraud because it has a ``lackadaisical,

   Jack Valenti used to recite Shakespeare while
driving along Texas highways with his boss, as they visited the
Humble Oil Co. gas stations dotting the road.
   Valenti, now president and chief executive officer of the Motion
Picture Association of America, and Humble's Garvin Allen ``Pop''
Mabry would attend the opening ceremonies of new filling stations,
and Valenti would gather stories about station operators for
company publications.
   ``I've seen Texas and it's fantastic, and I've never forgotten
that,'' said Valenti, who took the job at Humble to put himself
through night school at the University of Houston.
   Since then Valenti has circled the world and met the stars, but
Humble _ now Exxon Co. U.S.A. _ is still the best business he's
ever known, and the Texas landscape remains imprinted in his memory.
   Valenti is another Texas success story: The son of a county
courthouse clerk and grandson of Italian immigrants, he became
adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson, and the third man to reign
over the MPAA since its founding in 1922.
   The MPAA preserves and protects the rights of copyright owners;
serves as advocate for major producers and distributors of motion
pictures, TV programs and home video before the public, the U.S.
Congress, various departments of the federal government, and state
and local legislative bodies. The MPAA fights censorship and
restrictive attacks on the First Amendment, and directs an
anti-piracy program to protect American films in over 50 countries.
   It also provides guidance to parents of young children on the
suitability of movies through a rating system.
   Valenti does a lot of lobbying on Capitol Hill and is referred
to as the leading spokesman for the industry. He was named
president in April 1966.
   A plaque on his desk reads ``It CAN be done.''
   Valenti has done it, with the help, he says, of ``serendipity in
a macabre way.''
   He has gone from from usher, clean-up man and popcorn concession
operator in a second-rate movie house to the voice of the movie
industry. He went from stumping for local candidates as a child to
an office in the White House.
   In between, he flew 51 combat missions as a World War II bomber
pilot, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, six air medals
and three battle stars and earned a master's degree in business
administration from Harvard University.
   He's 66 now _ trim and fit, his hair white and his eyebrows
bushy, his eyes sparkling as he talks of the movie industry and how
it found him.
   ``You're sitting in the White House and the movie moguls offer
you a job you never expected to have, and then your life takes
another turn,'' he says.
   That was in 1966. Three years before, life took another sharp
turn for the Houston ad man who had done the Democratic Party's
1960 advertising campaign for Texas and had come to know Johnson
three years earlier. Valenti was sitting six or seven cars back
from President John F. Kennedy's limousine when Kennedy was
assassinated as the motorcade snaked through Dallas.
   At Parkland Memorial Hospital, Johnson ordered Valenti to
accompany him to Washington aboard Air Force One. Johnson was sworn
in as president on that flight. Valenti became his chief spokesman,
and has been in Washington since.
   He was Johnson's closest personal friend in the White House, and
Valenti once said that he slept better at night knowing Johnson was
president.
   Although his home is in Washington, Valenti is frequently on the
road, making sure American films ``move freely and unhobbled around
the world.''
   But unlike his Humble Oil travels to such places as Valley Mills
and Van Horn, Valenti now calls on Rome, London and Paris, Rio de
Janeiro, Singapore, New Delhi and Dakar. He's in California three
times a month, New York a little less.
   ``The back yard of the movie business is the world,'' he says.
   ``Movies are fascinating. ... The movie business is unlike any
other enterprise I know, with the possible exception of politics.
It's tedious sometimes, even pedestrian sometimes.
   ``But for the most part, it's been great fun,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``There's a continuing roll of problems _ that
sort of avalanche on you. But all are different and you're
constantly meeting new and interesting people.''
   His contract with the association has been renewed several times
since 1966, and the current one doesn't expire until the end of
1991.
   ``As long as I'm having fun here, I'll stay,'' he said.
   As a child, Valenti tasted politics and power through his
father. He was 10 when he gave his first political speech _ for a
sheriff.
   ``Very early on, I went on the stump _ everyone thought that was
cute,'' he said.
   He finished high school at 15 and spent the next year working
seven days a week at the Iris Theater, where Tarzan movies and
cowboy flicks were the main fare. After a year, he realized he
wanted an education: ``I really wanted to be a writer. I really
wanted to be a lawyer.''
   Walter Beach, his boss at Humble Oil, says he's not surprised by
Valenti's success.
   ``He was a very bright and energetic and imaginative young man _
really eager and anxious to do right, and truly applied himself to
whatever he was doing,'' said Beach, who was in charge of
publications for Humble until his retirement in 1970.
   ``I had a feeling he would spread out,'' Beach said. ``He had
both the personality and the education and the ambition to go
places. He had stars in his eyes all along.''

   Though a mood of caution and indecision
prevailed in the stock market for much of the time, there were
still a good many success stories to be told on Wall Street in the
first half of 1988.
   Indeed, in the waning days of June, 31 issues traded on the New
York Stock Exchange had doubled or more from their 1987 closing
prices.
   As any follower of the investment scene might expect, the list
of those winners was dominated by stocks of companies that became
the targets of takeover or buyout bids.
   Prominent examples: Murray Ohio Manufacturing, up 175 percent;
J.P. Stevens, 135 percent; Arkansas Best, 134 percent; York
International, 131 percent; Varo, 130 percent; Payless Cashways,
120 percent; Federated Department Stores, 119 percent; and American
Standard, 112 percent.
   While the overall averages posted gains for the first half of
the year, there were some notable laggards as the market struggled
to recover from the beating it took in the crash last fall.
   It was a test of patience for the 2.7 million-plus owners of
American Telephone & Telegraph, the nation's most widely held
stock, which closed June 30 at 26}, down 0.9 percent from the end
of 1987.
   AT&T holders fared much better than did the many fans of
Genentech, a high-flying leader in the promising field of
biotechnology.
   Genentech shares fell some 35 percent to rank among the first
half's biggest NYSE percentage change losers, as investors went
through a wrenching reappraisal of prospects for a Genentech drug
used to treat heart-attack patients.
   Still harder times befell Coleco Industries, the loss-plagued
toy and game manufacturer, whose stock fell more than 40 percent.
   Coleco shares, which traded as high as $65 a share in 1983 when
the company's Cabbage Patch Kids dolls were becoming a national
craze, reached mid-1988 in the neighborhood of $2.
   Aside from such individual cases, the market has had trouble
establishing any consistent themes so far in 1988.
   There was no standout strength, for example, either in stocks
that would benefit the most from an increase in inflation or in
issues that represent a ``disinflation'' play.
   Analysts said that betokened greater than usual confusion among
investors over the direction in which the economy was headed.
   The year began amid widespread recession fears in the wake of
Black Monday last Oct. 19.
   As it became clear that economic activity was running stronger
than almost everybody had forecast, the concern shifted to a
possible revival of inflation.
   By midyear, that scare seemed to have abated somewhat and, sure
enough, talk was stirring again of a business slump in 1989.
   In a compilation by Standard & Poor's Corp. of the comparative
performance of industry groups in the stock market through June 29,
many of the winners drew their strength from takeover bids or
battles that affected one or more of their component stocks: For
example, textile products, up 65 percent, and department stores, up
49 percent.
   Notable among the worst performers were some health-care groups
_ miscellaneous health care, down 30 percent, and medical products
and supplies, down 3 percent _ and high-technology entries like
computer software, down 11 percent, and electronic instruments,
down 4 percent.
   For those investors who bet on revived inflation, gold mining
stocks failed to pay off, falling nearly 5 percent.

<HEAD>Parents and Colleges Differ on Results of Aids Formula</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   College aid officers use a federal formula to
determine each family's ability to pay and how much aid it's
entitled to. But as tuitions rise faster than available aid, the
formula hasn't quelled the growing number of disagreements between
colleges and families over what each family can really afford.

<TEXT>
   Each year, 6.5 million families seeking college aid must undergo
a ``needs analysis.'' They fill out forms, supply tax information
and generally bare their financial souls to college officials to
make their case for grants or loans.
   But as a Jackson, Wyo., mother and her chronically ill
18-year-old son are learning this summer, colleges and families may
often differ sharply on what a family can really afford.
   A formula mandated by Congress is supposed to produce an
objective assessment of each family's capacity to pay, with the
college making up the difference with aid, either in direct grants
or low-interest loans.
   Financial aid for families above the poverty line is likely to
be double-edged, mainly loans that help families squeak through the
college years but can leave a legacy of debt that strains
middle-income budgets for a decade or more.
   Many families are stunned by their failure to qualify for
good-sized grants and by the amount of debt they must take on. They
fail to realize aid is based ``not on immediate liquidity, but on
the capacity to pay over an extended period of time relative to
other families,'' said Kathleen Brouder, director of information of
the College Scholarship Service, a branch of the College Board
which processes financial aid forms.
   As tuitions have soared, borrowing for college has increased
five-fold in the last decade. Since the mid-1970s, the loan
proportion of all student aid grew from one-fifth to one-half.
Federal statistics show average college debt after four years of
private college is $8,950. At public colleges, it is $6,685.
   The term ``needs analysis'' itself may mislead many families,
said Brouder, because the process doesn't really measure need, but
a family's capacity to pay and carry debt.
   That's small comfort to the woman from Jackson as she considers
an aid package from the University of Wyoming, where her son hopes
to enroll next fall. She must decide this month whether to accept
the package _ after that, the school has told her it will withdraw
its offer.
   ``I feel the system has me beat. The rules really hurt my class
of people. Something has to change,'' said the Jackson woman, who
agreed to discuss her finances in detail on condition of anonymity.
   ``I'm very confused and I'm very frustrated,'' she said.
   A divorced mother of three, she earns $19,760 as a medical
typist at St. John's Hospital, well above the federal poverty line
of $11,203 for a family of four.
   The family's principal asset is a 1,000-square foot
prefabricated home worth about $65,000. The family owns three cars,
a 1971 Ford, 1972 Dodge van and a 1974 Plymouth, and has cash
savings of $1,071. To ease its budget, the only meat the family
eats is moose and elk they hunt themselves.
   She gets no child support or alimony from her former husband,
whom she divorced in 1981 after 12 years of marriage.
   Her son suffers from Crohn's disease, a chronic, debilitating
intestinal inflammation that has meant surgery, high medical bills
and long periods where work or stress become dangerous.
   Total costs at the University of Wyoming next fall, including
tuition, fees, room and board, transportation and other expenses,
will be $5,910 _ close to the national average of $5,789 for
four-year public institutions.
   But even that relatively modest tuition would break her fragile
budget, the mother fears.
   ``Has income kept up with tuition? By any realistic measure, no.
And for most income groups, it's not even close,'' the American
Association of State Colleges and Universities said in a recent
publication.
   The university sent the family its first aid offer Feb. 26. The
school would provide grants and low-interest, federally subsidized
loans in the amount of $1,910 for the next school year. The mother
would have to contribute $1,650, the son $2,350, for a total family
contribution of $4,000 _ an amount equal to more than 20 percent of
Mrs. Garrison's pre-tax income.
   Under the federal formula, students getting aid are expected to
contribute at least $700 toward tuition, barring health or other
problems.
   ``I called the university in April. I said I can't be expected
to come up with this money, and neither can my son. I asked what it
would take for them to reconsider. Would a letter from my son's
doctor help? They said it might,'' she said.
   In June, the Salt Lake City specialist who treats her son wrote
the school that the stress of a previous job at a fast-food
restaurant ``may have had an adverse affect on the clinical course
of his illness. In fact, if his Crohn's disease flares up, he may
not be able to work at all.''
   On June 10, the university improved its offer. The mother would
have to contribute $1,457 toward tuition. The son would still be
required to contribute $859. The school would provide $550 in
grants. To make up the balance, the school would make available
$2,040 in federally guaranteed student loans at 8 percent interest
and $1,000 more in national direct student loans at 5 percent. By
the school's reckoning, its second offer of $3,590 in aid left an
``unmet need'' of $4. From the mother's point of view, it is far
higher.
   The university's aid officials, for their part, say they are
merely playing by rules set down in Washington. All college aid
offices are subject to periodic government audits to ensure they
are adhering to the federal formula for distributing financial aid.
Schools may offer more or less than the formula calls for, but they
must be prepared to justify and document their decisions.
   ``There is congressional methodology in arriving at aid, and we
have no option but to follow it,'' said John Nutter, interim
director of the University of Wyoming's financial aid office.
Beyond that, he declined to discuss the case.
   Parents can appeal to a university to reconsider an aid offer,
as this mother did with partial success. Some parents even get a
congressman or senator to lobby an aid officer for a better deal.
Beyond that, a family has little choice but to accept a school's
aid package, or try, if possible, to find a school more affordable.
   Despite her dismay over the aid package, she expects to accept
at least part of it, perhaps borrowing some from her mother instead
of the federal government.
   ``It's important that somehow my son go to school,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   As millions of Americans hit the roads for
summer vacation, burglars and other crooks go into action for one
of their busiest seasons.
   Summer is one of the peak times for burglary, police statistics
show, thanks to the combination of closed schools and absent
vacationers.
   The insurance industry reports that most burglars turn out to be
school-age young people.
   That means, of course, that most burglars are not professionals,
just adolescents taking advantage of unguarded homes during their
idle time. A few simple precautions can discourage most of them,
according to the Insurance Information Institute.
   Lots of companies are advertising complex and costly alarm
systems, and many of them do a good job. They can turn on lights,
set off noisy bells and sirens and even alert a central office or
the police in the event someone tries to enter your home.
   Probably not everyone needs or can afford a high-tech system.
But there are still things they can do to help protect the home.
   To begin with, lock doors and windows, including the attic,
basement and garage. Sure, this sounds obvious. Yet police report
that many burglars get into homes through doors and windows
carelessly left unlocked.
   The insurance institute recommends deadbolt or double cylinder
locks for doors, and notes that a variety of good, inexpensive
window locks are on sale.
   In many areas, local police will do a free security audit of the
home and make recommendations.
   When away, try to make the home look lived in, the institute
says.
   For example, have someone mow the lawn, and ask a neighbor to
collect the mail and newspapers instead of stopping delivery. The
fewer people who know you're away, the better.
   Do not hide keys outside the home, burglars know where to look.
Leave a key with a friend or neighbor who can check on the house
from time to time.
   Get automatic timers for lights to keep the place looking lived
in. Keep ladders out of sight and locked up.
   Valuable items should be locked in a safe deposit box or other
secure storage.
   And, the insurers note, many home insurance policies have limits
on the coverage for items such as jewelry, furs, silver and other
valuables. If you have such property, an additional policy may be
needed.
   If a urglar does break in, stereos, televisions and such are
among the most popular items to steal.
   Permanently mark them in an inconspicuous place with initials,
Social Security number or some other identifying mark. Often,
police will lend an electric engraving tool for this purpose. With
this mark, if police do recover the stolen items, you will be able
to identify yours and get them back.
   When back from vacation, look for signs of burglary before
entering the home. Surprising a burglar could be a deadly mistake.
   And while on the road, remember you are not immune from crime
either. Be wary of pickpockets and setups, such as someone dropping
a handful of change to distract you while an accomplice steals
luggage or other property.
   Never leave luggage unattended, travel experts say, and always
be wary of problems in crowded areas, especially if bumped or
jostled.
   Wrap your wallet in rubber bands _ that makes it much harder to
slip out of the pocket, suggests the American Express Company. And
women should carry the purse tucked securely under their arm.
   Some thieves have adopted the strategy of putting up signs that
say ``Beware of Pickpockets,'' and watching people to see which
pocket they check on viewing the sign.

<HEAD>Actress Rebeca Arthur Typecast as Airline Stewardess</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rebeca is correct</NOTE>

<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Actors are commonly typecast in certain
roles, but Rebeca Arthur of ABC's ``Perfect Strangers'' seems
typecast by occupation.
   ``I play an airline stewardess on the show,'' she said. ``I was
an airline stewardess on `Newhart.' When I came to Los Angeles the
first thing I did was `Remington Steele.' I was a flight attendant.
I've played a flight attendant on every show I've been on.''
   Oddly, before she became an actress she was a private
investigator. She specialized in finding missing persons and became
so successful at it she became supervisor of a large office of
detectives.
   Arthur plays Mary Anne, no dumb blonde but perhaps too literal
for her own good. She takes everyone and everything at face value,
which makes her appear to be a little dizzy.
   Mary Anne and her roommate, Jennifer, played by Melanie Wilson,
are two stewardesses who are neighbors of Larry (Mark Linn-Baker)
and Balki (Bronson Pinchot). Although they're not paired off, Balki
does have a crush on Mary Anne and Larry on Jennifer.
   In the show, Balki is a naive sheepherder who has left his
Mediterranean home to live with his cousin in Chicago. It's ``The
Odd Couple'' with a cultural clash thrown in. Balki, in his own
way, takes things as literally as Mary Anne.
   ``The producers always want us in uniform, and Melanie and I are
always begging not to wear those scratchy things,'' Arthur said.
``On the last show we did we said we wanted to wear our pretty
dresses. When we walked onto the set for rehearsal there were Mark
and Bronson in pretty dresses. We near fell down.
   ``The script had said, `Jennifer and Mary Anne enter and cross
to the boys. They are in their pretty dresses.' It was ambiguous as
to who was in the dresses, so they did it as a dig at us.''
   Arthur's role on the show began as a guest appearance.
   ``I wasn't supposed to hang around this long,'' she said. ``I'd
never been a regular on a show before. I've worked on other
comedies, but nothing ever this goofy. We have a lot of fun.''
   At the audition, she read for the role of Jennifer. ``The two
characters are very different,'' she said, ``I didn't feel I was
right for Jennifer. I wanted to read for Rachel, which was Mary
Anne's name in the first script. They never did let me read for the
role I'm now playing.''
   The original order for ``Perfect Strangers'' was for six shows.
``When I saw the promo for the show I said, `There's another one
that'll get canceled,''' Arthur said. ``But it did well in the
ratings and they got a pickup for 13. I was in the first show of
the 13. Then I came back for the fifth show and I've been there
ever since.
   ``Melanie and I did three shows without a contract. We thought
each show would be our last. We were just a couple of neurotic
actresses. Then they signed us. Now, Melanie and I are best friends
and we're still neurotic.''
   Although Arthur's been on television only a short time, she
already has an Emmy. But her Emmy is a toy poodle.
   ``I named her Emmy in case I never won one,'' she said. ``She's
a little teacup and when I travel I put her into a bag and take her
with me. She's good about it, but after a six-hour flight she wants
to run around and be silly.''
   In her travels, she's often recognized, although most people
can't put a name to the face.
   ``People will come up to me, touch me and say, `Ain't you that
girl?''' she said. ``I don't know. It depends on what `that girl'
did.''
   ``Perfect Strangers'' has been out of production since last
December, and with the continuing writers' strike it's uncertain
when it will start filming again. Arthur did have a small role in
the movie ``Scrooge,'' starring Bill Murray.
   ``The first day I was on the (movie) set was the first day of
the strike,'' she said. ``The script needed some rewrites so we had
to wing it. I was only on the picture for two days, but I got to
dress up like a funky little Miss Santa Claus of 1968 and Xerox my
heinie. The joke was I give a copy to the character played by John
Forsythe.
   ``I said I wouldn't do it unless I wore something. They offered
me a G-string, but I wore boxer shorts.''
   Arthur grew up in Cumberland, Md., and began her career in New
York. But unlike other aspiring actresses, she supported herself as
a private investigator while waiting for her break.
   ``I'd find missing husbands and wives and runaway high school
students,'' she said. ``It's real hard to disappear. I could
usually find a missing person because they nearly always leave some
trace. I talk a lot so people think I'm stupid and tell me
everything. The money was good and they kept promoting me until I
ended up a supervisor with a pink office.''
   She quit after three years when she began getting better TV
parts.

<HEAD>Productivity Doesn't Always Equate With Money Spent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few indicators of future business activity are
more closely watched than the amount of money earmarked for capital
investment and research and development.
   But maybe, some folks are now saying, the attention is a bit
overdone.
   The widespread, almost automatic assumption made is that money
spent on new plants and equipment and in developing new products is
an investment that returns itself many times over.
   Economists, political leaders, academics and others watch these
items for other reasons as well. Such spending, for example,
supposedly shows the level of confidence in the future, and it is
equated with more efficient production.
   Now comes an authority on productivity who cautions against
falling in love with such expenditures. Not that they are
unimportant, says C. Jackson Grayson Jr. But, he says, let us not
lose our perspective.
   Grayson, probably best remembered as chairman of President
Richard Nixon's price commission, has been studying productivity
issues for the past decade, mainly as chairman of the American
Productivity Center in Houston.
   Among other activities, he also served on President Jimmy
Carter's Commission on the Agenda for the '80s and was a member of
President Reagan's National Productivity Advisory Committee.
Productivity is his specialty.
   From that background, he issues what is likely to be considered
an almost sacrilegious criticism: ``Capital investment is not the
principal cause of productivity growth nor of its slowdown.''
   With Carla O'Dell, vice president of the productivity center,
Grayson has written ``American Business: A Two-Minute Warning,'' a
volume examining the sometimes surprising relationship between
capital investment and productivity.
   Such spending hardly correlates with increased productivity, for
example. As they point out, U.S. productivity growth declined from
1965 to 1978 while capital investment increased during the same
period.
   In fact, they say, ``capital investment may well be the result
of growth, rather than its source _ better growth prospects attract
more investment.''
   The concentration on physical investment, on plants and
equipment, also has led to a relative neglect of factors that are
equally or even more important for productivity and quality
improvement, Grayson and O'Dell say.
   They observe, for example, that investments in human capital,
though not as often examined as physical investments, are
especially important in improving quality and production. Can
anyone deny that quality education doesn't pay off?
   Those who place great faith in dollar amounts also might be
misguided in another respect. Grayson and O'Dell observe that
``there is a difference between the volume of capital investment
and the productivity of that investment.''
   Grayson can speak on that subject both as an experienced hand
and as an academic authority. Where, for example, is it more
evident than in government that throwing money at a situation does
not necessarily improve it?
   In this respect, the authors call attention to a concept that
might not be correct for these times: Why do we still believe that
long production runs, greater volume, big factories and automation
mean greater productivity?
   They observe that ``the best American and Japanese firms have
shown that it is often more productive to focus on less, not more:
small batches, small inventories, and flexibile, simple machines.''
   They have a special message for politicans and government
officials:
   ``Among the more important things government at all levels could
do are improve education, privatize more government services,
improve the collections and reporting of competitiveness
statistics, improve productivity in government and cut the budget
deficit.''
   That, not just money, is bound to improve productivity, they say.

   If the first half of 1988 is any indication of
what the rest of the year will be like for bonds and interest
rates, better hang on to your hats now.
   ``Anybody who survived the first half of '88 had to have had
their seatbelt on,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ``The market was extremely
volatile.''
   Bonds started out the year on a strong note, with interest rates
continuing to decline following last fall's stock market crash. The
Federal Reserve had relaxed its credit policies on the widespread
belief the crash might affect spending habits and push the economy
into a recession. And declining oil prices also played an important
role in dampening any inflation concerns.
   But as the economy showed surprising resilience, interest rates
started to climb again and bonds lost their luster. Concern turned
to the possibility of higher inflation and the interest-rate
outlook overseas along with the dollar's instability in foreign
exchange.
   Those factors continue to plague the credit markets, although
rates have eased lately on the recent strength of the dollar. A
firm U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated bonds and notes more
attractive to foreigners and lessens the prospects of higher
inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities.
   ``If you're a bond trader and you made money in the first six
months of the year, then you were a superstar,'' said Jay
Goldinger, who runs the Beverly Hills, Calif., investment banking
firm Capital Insight Inc. ``Most of us ended up about even.''
   ``The interesting thing is that with all the ups and down we've
had, we haven't changed all that much,'' noted Maury Harris, chief
economist for PaineWebber Inc.
   Bond prices and yields right now are about where they were at
the start of the year.
   For instance, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, the most
widely-watched issue in the credit markets, stood at 8.93 percent
on Jan. 4. On the last day of June it was 8.85 percent, down from
8.92 percent in the previous session.
   And the Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, looked at the end of June like it
had barely budged from early January.
   In the intervening months, however, prices and yields proceeded
on a veritable roller-coaster ride. The 30-year bond, which peaked
at 10.4 percent the day of the market crash last October, tumbled
to a low of 8.29 percent on Feb. 5 and jumped to a high of 9.35
percent on May 23.
   Commercial lending rates followed suit. Major banks lowered
their prime lending rates _ used to set rates on most corporate and
consumer loans _ a quarter of a percentage point to 8.5 percent on
Feb. 2, then raised them to 9 percent on May 11.
   Mortgage rates followed a similar pattern. For a conventional
30-year fixed-rate mortgage, rates ranged from a low of 9.84
percent in mid-February to a high of 10.58 percent in late May and
early June, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The confusion in the marketplace scared away some municipal and
corporate issuers.
   For the first six months, the volume of municipal issues totaled
$52.76 billion, compared with $58.13 billion a year ago. The volume
of corporate issues fell to $141.4 billion from $157 billion in
1987.
   ``Right now, sentiment is cautiously bullish,'' based largely on
the dollar's recent strength, said Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover.
   But he said bond investors are keeping an eye on the Midwestern
drought and what effects that might have on food prices and
inflation _ although most economists say the drought's impact
probably won't be felt until the beginning of next year.
   Some economists predict a drop in interest rates for the
remainder of 1988, based in part on the declining oil market, the
firmer dollar and the feeling that the economy eventually will run
out of steam.
   But as PaineWebber's Harris concedes, what happened in the first
half of 1988 ``goes to show how difficult it is to predict.''

<HEAD>Latest Insider Trading Case Turns Spotlight on Foreign-Based Scams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's biggest insider-trading case since the
Boesky scandal, with money trails stretching from Wall Street to
secretive Swiss banks to teeming Hong Kong, shows how globalized
markets can spawn bold schemers who aren't necessarily deterred by
tough U.S. securities laws, experts say.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices the
nation's stock and bond markets, has obtained increased cooperation
from overseas governments in conducting investigations of
foreign-based fraud over the past few years.
   But many governments remain reluctant to comply with SEC
requests for help, and a few express hostility and resentment,
providing a convenient shield for foreign insider traders in U.S.
securities.
   In some countries, the use of non-public information to profit
in the financial markets is perfectly acceptable.
   ``The world is not in any kind of agreement that insider trading
is a heinous crime,'' said John S. Stoppelman, a securities law
attorney in Washington and former chairman of the SEC task force on
investigation rules. ``Some of these countries think we're crazy to
enforce these laws.''
   Obtaining cooperation from foreign governments is an important
part of the SEC's case against Hong Kong-based businessman Fred C.
Lee and Morgan Stanley & Co. junior analyst Stephen Wang Jr.,
accused co-conspirators in a scheme to profit on inside information
about impending corporate takeovers.
   A complaint, filed last Monday in U.S. District Court, demanded
the pair return $19 million in alleged illicit profits plus triple
penalties for a total of $76 million. That amount is second only to
the record $100 million in profits and penalties the SEC seized
from insider trader Ivan F. Boesky in November 1986.
   Although SEC investigators gathered much of the evidence against
Wang and Lee in the United States, the key break came when they
questioned Lee in Hong Kong, for which they needed cooperation from
the British colony's government.
   ``The fact they were taking testimony in Hong Kong suggests the
commission is much further along than a couple of years ago in
getting active and passive assistance of other law enforcement
authorities,'' said Anne Flannery, a New York-based securities
lawyer who used to work for the SEC.
   ``Agencies like the SEC, which are quasi-criminal in nature,
don't conduct inquiries without foreign help,'' she said.
   Besides the Hong Kong connection, the SEC also has disclosed a
Swiss link in the Wang-Lee probe. Commission Chairman David S.
Ruder, testifying at a Senate Banking Committee hearing this past
week, said the commission was negotiating with Switzerland's
government for information about Swiss bank accounts controlled by
Lee and a possible freeze of assets in those accounts.
   In addition, SEC enforcement chief Gary Lynch disclosed at the
same hearing that the commission is pursuing about 50
investigations involving foreign trading, with sums ranging from
$40,000 to ``some very large amounts.''
   SEC officials attribute the growth of these investigations
largely to the increasing relationships between markets, which now
make it possible to easily trade U.S. stocks in cities ranging from
Paris to Singapore. A foreign-based investor with inside
information about an American company can make profitable trades
halfway around the world.
   As a result, Lynch said in a telephone interview, ``There's more
of an acceptance of the notion that a person who affects
transactions in the securities market of a particular country
should comply with the laws of that country regardless of where
they happen to live.''
   For example, the Swiss have become increasingly cooperative,
securities experts say. Switzerland, which once routinely dismissed
queries about ownership of financial assets, now has an independent
commission that oversees SEC requests for help.
   Moreover, a new law took effect Friday in Switzerland that makes
insider trading a criminal offense. The measure will make it easier
for the Swiss to assist the SEC.
   Other countries historically have rejected the SEC's requests
for information and continue to do so, partly out of sovereignty
principles. France and Liechtenstein, for example, are considered
notoriously uncooperative.
   Sen. Donald W. Reigle Jr., D-Mich., has sponsored a bill aimed
at making it easier for the SEC to investigate foreign-based
insider trading. The bill would allow the commission to investigate
on behalf of foreign governments, which would be expected to
reciprocate.
   Nevertheless, such legislation would not compel other countries
to adopt U.S.-style prohibitions against insider trading, which
remains a fundamental problem as international securities markets
grow in complexity and scope.
   ``I don't think they're going to buy all our concepts of
securities fraud,'' Stoppelman said. ``Just because it seems
morally unacceptable, that doesn't mean the whole world agrees with
us.''

   _Grain and soybean futures swung wildly in heavy trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade because of the drought, which has raised the
prospect of higher food prices and hurt the farm equipment business.
   _The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, the government's
chief economic forecasting gauge, dipped 0.1 percent in May, but
analysts said the decline did not suggest a threat to economic

suggested a mixed picture. One said existing home sales rose 3.1
percent in May while sales of new homes edged down 0.3 percent.
Another report said construction spending climbed 1.1 percent in
May.
   _U.S. factory orders for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in
May, but analysts weren't concerned, attibuting the drop to a
decline in demand for aircraft, which fluctuates from month to
month.
   _A Commerce Department report showed the United States

<HEAD>Rising Demand, Drought Fears Keep Pushing Sugar Prices Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising demand from the Far East has helped push sugar futures
prices to 6{-year highs, and analysts say the Midwestern drought
has sparked an increase in bullish speculation that could drive
prices higher still.
   On the other hand, any hint that the rally is running of steam
could send the market plunging as nervous traders on New York's
Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange scurry to take profits _ or cut
their losses, experts say.
   Sugar prices have risen steadily since bottoming out at about
2.75 cents a pound in mid-1985 when world stockpiles stood at
record highs. Growing demand and declining production have
gradually reduced the surplus until it now stands just above the
critically low level of 30 percent of the anticipated 1988-89
demand, according to Judith Weissman Ganes, an analyst with the
investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   In contrast to the slow, steady gains during much of the past 3
years, sugar prices for near-month delivery have skyrocketed in the
last two months, from about 8 cents a pound at the end of April to
more than 13 cents a pound at the end of June.
   Moves by China during the past year to increase the availability
of sugar in that country has had a profound impact on the market,
said Erik Dunlaevy, a trader with New York-based commodities and
brokerage firm Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   ``Basically, the government of China decided to let the Chinese
fulfill their desires for sugar,'' he said. ``They decentralized
the purchasing to a certain extent, so you have different entities
buying sugar instead of one central purchasing agency.''
   He said China ordinarily buys its sugar from Thailand,
Australia, the Philippines and other exporters in the Eastern
Hemisphere. But the increased demand from the Chinese has forced
those producers to raise their prices, prompting China and other
Far Eastern consumer nations to shop for lower-priced sugar in the
West.
   Caribbean nations supply much of the Western Hemisphere's sugar,
and Caribbean sugar is traditionally the type that gets delivered
on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, Dunlaevy said. Thus, China's
increased demand is largely responsible for the sharp rise in sugar
futures prices.
   Exacerbating the situation is the drought, which threatens to
substantially reduce yields of sugar beets in the Red River Valley
region of Minnesota and North Dakota, analysts said.
   ``That's the largest beet crop in this country, so the beet crop
here could be down 500,000 to 700,000 tons,'' said Thomas Oxnard,
vice president of commodities trading for PaineWebber Inc. in
Clifton, N.J.
   ``On a worldwide basis, that's not a huge number but it's a
further drawdown in stocks,'' he said.
   The drought has also increased bullish speculation in sugar
futures, just as it has in virtually every other market for U.S.
agricultural products.
   ``I know there are traders who have one eye on soybeans and one
eye on sugar and when beans go up, they buy sugar,'' Oxnard said.
``To some degree all these markets have just piggybacked on top of
each other.''
   One measure of market speculation is ``open interest,'' the
number of buy or sell orders that have not been canceled out by an
offsetting order. Since late April, open interest in sugar futures
has expanded from less than 130,000 to nearly 170,000.
   ``A large part of the open interest is speculative in nature,
representing a lot of fund and commission-house speculators,'' Ms.
Ganes said.
   Although many analysts, including Ms. Ganes, expect sugar prices
to climb higher in the near term, they acknowledged that prices
could also fall very rapidly.
   ``If the market does show signs of weakening, (speculators) will
be fairly quick at taking a profit and that could result in a sharp
turn in the market,'' Ms. Ganes said. ``The people who got in at
the higher levels are going to be quicker to get out, and that
could exaggerate the correction.''

<HEAD>Cheaper Oil a Tonic for Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street's inflation-watchers are counting on
cheaper oil to take the sting out of rising food prices in the
months ahead.
   World oil prices have fallen sharply of late amid signs that
oil-exporting countries are producing faster than market demand can
absorb.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil, widely used as an overall
gauge of the trend in oil prices, dropped below $15 a barrel Friday
to its lowest level since 1986.
   That news, together with some rainfall at last in the parched
Farm Belt, has encouraged talk in the financial markets that
inflation might not be as bad as had been feared in the second half
of 1988.
   One of the most reliable barometers of inflationary
expectations, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, has fallen from
a peak of nearly 9.5 percent several weeks ago to less than 9
percent in recent days.
   The drought watch continues on Wall Street, of course, even as
it does in the areas of the country that suffer most directly from
the lack of moisture.
   While the current weather charts showed rain in the Midwest this
past week, traders in the futures and financial markets switched
their attention to forecasts suggesting more unusually dry
conditions in the next few weeks.
   For the national economy, however, many analysts say it is
necessary to keep the role of agricultural commodities in
perspective.
   ``Although the drought could be the worst in nearly a century,
it should be kept in mind that the importance of raw food
commodities has changed dramatically over the years, and the impact
of sharp price rises in this area is not particularly great on
consumer spending or the inflation indices,'' said Michael Sherman,
analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   David A. Levy and S. Jay Levy, a Chappaqua, N.Y., economic
forecasting team, say they have no desire the minimize the distress
the drought is causing for farmers and other businesses in
agricultural areas.
   However, they add, ``the drought will indeed increase the prices
of many foods but have limited impact on inflation. Food and
beverages account for less than 18 percent of the Consumer Price
Index.''
   Furthermore, they add, rising food prices actually can serve to
depress prices of many non-food items.
   ``As food prices accelerate this year, non-food stores,
especially those competing for consumers' discretionary income,
will lose some sales. Price-cutting will be more frequent.
   ``This deflationary effect will substantially reduce the overall
impact of the drought on the CPI to about half a percent.''
   Despite such assurances, the stock market's early-summer rally
bogged down in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials slipped 11.38 to 2,131.58, ending a five-week winning
streak.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped .88 to
153.68; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 3.08 to 394.70, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up .51 at 309.00.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 208.42 million shares a day,
against 170.99 million the week before.
   Like the drought, the decline in the price of oil is cause for
serious concern in some already beleaguered areas of the country.
   But unlike the dry weather, cheaper oil can be seen as a
distinct plus for such broad economic forces as nationwide consumer
spending.
   ``This recent drop in oil prices reminds us of the drop back in
early 1986 when the Dow Jones industrials were rallying and had
moved above 1,700,'' said Jay Donnaruma, an analyst at First Albany
Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   ``At that time no one liked the rally and everyone was looking
for a correction. We get the same feeling now.
   ``Can the rally in stocks, bonds and the dollar all be related
to the drop in crude oil prices? Probably not entirely _ but for
our money, watching the price of oil is better than watching the
stars.''

<HEAD>Economy Accelerating, Purchasing Managers Survey Indicates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy expanded at a healthy pace in June
as production and new orders at the nation's manufacturers surged,
according to a survey of purchasing executives released Monday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which
conducts a monthly survey of economic trends at more than 250
industrial companies, said its index of economic growth soared to
59.3 percent in June from 55.1 percent in May.
   A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is expanding,
while levels below that point generally indicate the economy is
contracting.
   The June increase was fueled by an improvement in new orders and
production, the association said.
   Thirty-four percent of the purchasing managers questioned in the
survey said their companies had more new orders in June, compared
to 30 percent in May. Fifty-four percent _ unchanged from the May
results _ said new orders were the same. Twelve 12 percent, down
from 16 percent the previous month, said the number of new orders
fell.
   A sharply higher number of purchasing managers reported an
improvement in production, with 35 percent saying production was
up, 53 percent saying it was the same and 12 percent saying it was
down. In May, 27 percent said production had improved, 62 percent
said it was the same and 11 percent said it declined.
   Another indication of an improvement in the economy came in a
slowdown in vendor deliveries, which signals that the demand for
materials is outstripping the ability of manufacturers to fill
orders.
   In June, 32 percent of the managers said deliveries were slower,
up sharply from May's 19 percent. Five percent _ unchanged from May
_ said deliveries were faster, and 63 percent, down from 76 percent
in May, said materials were arriving at the same pace.
   In another area, 18 percent of the respondents reported an
increase in inventories, while 60 percent said inventories were the
same and 22 percent said they were lower. In May, 25 percent
reported higher inventories, 58 percent said they were the same and
17 percent said they were lower.
   A drop in inventories indicates healthy sales at a company.
However, many firms, caught with heavy backlogs of goods in the
past, have been working to keep their inventories in line.
   The respondents reported the prices they pay for materials
continued to rise. In June, 66 percent of the purchasing managers
said they paid higher prices, which was up from 64 percent in May.
Thirty-two percent said prices were the same, down from 35 percent,
and 2 percent said they were lower, compared with 1 percent the
previous month.
   Twenty percent of the respondents reported their companies had
higher employment levels, up from 14 percent in May. Sixty-four
percent said employment was the same, compared with May's 75
percent, and 16 percent said it was lower, up from 11 percent.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is a trade
organization representing 30,000 purchasing managers in 21
industries.
