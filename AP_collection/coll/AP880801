<DATELINE>ALTOONA, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters put out a fire in a tanker car
Monday night and authorities allowed 2,000 evacuees to return home
for the first time since two freight trains crashed head-on and
derailed.
   Police Chief Britt Adair said the fire was extinguished about 5
p.m. and the residents of northeast Altoona were allowed back in
their homes about a half hour later.
   The two Iowa Interstate Railroad trains, one of which included
two tanker cars carrying as much as 20,000 gallons each of volatile
denatured alcohol, collided shortly before noon Saturday. Two
crewmen were killed and their bodies were recovered Monday after
the last fire was out.
   The chief investigator said Monday the probe was centering on
whether one of the trains was off schedule.
   Fire coming from one of the cars had burned out by Monday but
authorities waited to allow residents to return because of the
danger of explosion from the second tanker.
   Flames shot up to 20 feet over the weekend but had shrunk to
about 1{ feet by Monday morning.
   ``If it fireballed, it would kill anything within its path for a
quarter mile, with devastating effects up to a half mile, and the
capability of throwing shrapnel from the cars a mile and a half.
That's why we evacuated a mile and a half surrounding it,'' said
Adair. ``That's with one of them exploding, and we had two burning
at one time.''
   Bulldozers and cranes were picking through the debris and
clearing the tracks of the 86 derailed cars.
   ``It's a situation where one of the engines rode up over the
other one in a head-on collision _ went clear up in the air _ and
it just completely annihilated two engines,'' the police chief
said. ``There is metal and twisted debris and wheels thrown all
over the place.''
   He said workers had removed about 16 hopper cars by
mid-afternoon Monday and that the rail line could be open to
traffic by midnight if the two tankers could be removed without
problems.
   Investigators were trying to determine how the two trains came
to be on the same track. Edward Dobranetski, who heads the National
Transportation Safety Board investigating team, said the two
surviving crewmen and other rail workers were interviewed Monday.
   Dobranetski said his inquiry has not determined ``whether one
train left early or whether the other was running late.'' The
westbound train was to have cleared the track by 11:56 a.m., while
the eastbound train wasn't scheduled to leave Altoona until 12:01
p.m., he said.
   Investigators examined the controls of the wrecked eastbound
train and found nothing out of order, said Dobranetski. ``The
emergency brake was being applied,'' he added.
   The crash killed William Peers, 54, of Des Moines, and Larry
Buckingham Jr., 35, of Winterset, both longtime employees of the
railroad. Their bodies were located under the two derailed tankers,
but had not been recovered earlier because of the danger of
explosion.
   Rail officials said the eastbound Council Bluffs-Chicago train
was pulling 78 cars, while the westbound train was pulling eight
cars from Newton to Des Moines.
   The two employees on the eastbound train jumped to safety before
the trains collided. Both victims were on the westbound train.
   ``He had an obviously dangerous job. He left home thousands of
times and came back thousands of times,'' said Peers' son, Dan.
``This time, he didn't.''
   ``They all worry about something like this happening,'' said
Buckingham's widow, La Voy. ``But he was always more worried about
someone else getting hurt at the crossings in a car or truck.''

<TEXT>
   Police officers in West Virginia and
three other states dropped plans Monday to picket a Willie Nelson
appearance after learning the country-and-western singer will give
a concert to benefit both police and American Indian causes.
   ``If everything goes as planned, we probably won't have any
demonstration,'' said Al Leavitt, president of the state Fraternal
Order of Police.
   Police nationwide have been critical of Nelson's appearance last
October at a benefit for Leonard Peltier, an American Indian
activist serving two life sentences for the 1975 slayings of two
FBI agents.
   Peltier's supporters are raising money to pay for an appeal.
   The West Virginia FOP made plans to protest at Nelson's Aug. 27
concert in Charleston after Rhode Island police said they would
picket the singer concerts last weekend in Warwick, R.I.
   About 800 officers from four states demonstrated at the Friday
concert but canceled their Saturday protest after Nelson agreed to
the new benefit concert.

   Temperatures in the upper 90s or above 100 degrees lingered
Monday across the middle Mississippi Valley, parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes region.
   Temperatures of 100 degrees or above were reported as far north
as southern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin, where high humidity
was pushing heat index values up close to 120 degrees at some
locations.
   The National Weather Service said 23 cities reported record
highs for the date. Dubuque, Iowa, had 100 degrees, breaking the
record of 98 set in 1894. Temperatures in Eau Claire, Wis., reached
a record 104; and in La Crosse, Wis., it reached 105, smashing a
24-year-old record by 8 degrees.
   In Indiana, South Bend established an all-time record for the
month of August with a 103 reading, topping the old record of 100
set on Aug. 5 and 6, 1947. Milwaukee also had all-time hottest
August reading with 103.
   Chicago had its sixth day of the season with a reading at or
above 100, padding a record broken earlier in the season.
   Temperatures were generally in the upper 80s and lower 90s
elsewhere east of the Rockies. Clouds were keeping readings in the
70s and lower 80s in the southern high Plains, in the upper 60s to
lower 80s from northeastern Montana to the northern half of
Minnesota and in the upper 70s and lower 80s in New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from south-central
Texas through the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic
Coast states. Daytime heating of a humid air mass over the nation's
southeast brought afternoon showers and thunderstorms. A weak
weather disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico was producing showers
and thunderstorms over the Florida Keys.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also developing along and ahead
of a warm front curving through the northern Plains and the upper
Mississippi Valley.
   Sunny and dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Rainfall totals for the six hour period ended at 2 p.m. EDT
included an inch at Sierra Vista, Ariz., and a third of an inch at
Key West, Fla.
   Showers and thunderstorms produced up to an inch and a half of
rain in central North Dakota Monday morning. Showers and
thunderstorms in south-central Texas produced an inch of rain at
Del Rio, with close to 3 inches reported west of Loma Alta.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 104 degrees at Elkhart, Ind. The
nation's low Monday morning was 38 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Tuesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Great Lakes region to the northern Plains
and across the Rockies, with showers and thunderstorms in northern
Arizona, western Montana and Upper Michigan. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms were forecast for south-central Texas through the
Tennessee Valley and central Gulf Coast states to the southern
Atlantic Coast.
   High temperatures were to be in the 90s across much of the
nation east of the Rockies, with readings near 100 degrees in the
central Plains and the middle Mississippi Valley. Highs were
forecast in the 80s in New England and from the northern high
Plains to Upper Michigan, 80s and 90s in the West, with readings
above 100 degrees in the Southwest deserts. Highs in the 70s were
forecast from the northern Rockies across Washington and northern
Oregon.

<TEXT>
   Amish farmer Elam Swartzentruber
believes he has something better than electricity and technology to
help him through the worst drought in more than 50 years: faith and
brotherhood.
   Swartzentruber, better known by his Amish neighbors as ``Elam
E.,'' is one of approximately 30,000 Amish residents in Ohio,
15,000 of them involved in farming.
   The Amish, a Protestant group formed in a split with the
Mennonites in 17th century Switzerland, believe in simplicity. They
dress plainly, are forbidden to have electricity in their homes and
do not use motorized equipment on their farms.
   It is that difference from the way ``the English'' work the land
that has protected the Amish and Mennonites from financial ruin
during the drought that is plaguing the Midwest. The Mennonites
also follow simple ways, but are permitted to use some modern
technology.
   Amish and Mennonite farmers in eastern Ohio say they have lost
about half of this year's hay crop and have seen a marked decrease
in the quality and size of their oat and corn crops.
   But Swartzentruber, 52, of Millersburg in Holmes County, said he
expects no long-term financial problems because he does not have
the debt other farmers must repay. And he said he always pays cash
for grain and seed.
   ``I don't talk too good, but I farm good,'' Swartzentruber said
in his thick German accent. ``This is the worst I've seen it ever,
but I think it won't get any worse.''
   He said the drought has not hurt his dairy cattle or feeder hogs
and he expects to make a profit selling milk. But next year's feed
prices likely will rise, making it tougher to make ends meet.
   ``The Amish have been hurt by the drought, but not as much as
you would think,'' said Lloyd Miller, a local expert on the people
and their customs.
   Miller left the Old Order Amish years ago but is considered a
close friend and liaison by the Amish and Mennonites.
   They often do things in addition to farming, such as
woodworking, and because they are so thrifty they have money put
away for emergencies, Miller said.
   ``They may look poor, but that does not necessarily mean they
are,'' he said.
   Jonas Miller, a Mennonite who farms 100 acres near
Fredericksburg, also is an auctioneer at the weekly Mount Hope farm
supply sale, raises registered European Haflinger horses and sells
deer hides.
   He said he attended a recent auction that did not end until 10
hours later than normal.
   ``People, including the Amish and Mennonites, were panicking,
selling everything that doesn't make them money,'' Jonas Miller
said. ``But not me. My father always told me `When everybody runs,
just walk.'
   ``I was lucky. I bought a lot of hay in April. It wasn't
foresight. It was just luck. But you can be sure I'm hanging on to
it.''
   Jonas Miller, who is not related to Lloyd Miller, grows corn,
hay and oats and raises dairy cows and hogs. He said only half of
his oats and hay crops have come in. He does not hold much hope for
his corn.
   ``I will lose a lot of money, but I _ as we all do _ have tried
to operate as sharply as I could,'' said the 52-year-old farmer.
   Abraham Yoder, an Old Order farmer who works 95 acres near Mount
Hope with his five young sons, said the situation there is not as
bad as he first thought.
   ``At first it looked like we weren't getting any corn, now it is
looking like we're going to get half a crop,'' he said.
   He said his second hay cutting, which normally yields 3,500
bales, this year produced 2,600. His milk production is down as is
his profit from the sale of pigs.
   The three farmers all said the drought will not take too large a
toll on the community because they take care of each other.
   An Amish farmer lost his barn two weeks ago when it was hit by
lightning, but Jonas Miller said area Mennonite and Amish farmers
were organizing a barn-raising that would not end until the barn is
reconstructed.

<HEAD>Censorship, Military Aid and Sanctions Feature in Commonwealth
Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flame of a white candle is blown out, and
over a background of rhythmic black chanting an announcer tells
viewers: ``Don't let South Africa keep the world in the dark.''
   The television spot, paid for by the Canadian government, is the
only state-sponsored message of its kind ever used to fight
apartheid.
   It's being broadcast in Toronto as part of a ``Rekindle the
Light'' festival surrounding a meeting of eight Commonwealth
foreign ministers that starts today and will examine ways to combat
white rule in South Africa.
   There's a public forum, film premiere and exhibition of photos
and posters banned in South Africa. Tonight, during a jazz concert
on the shores of Lake Ontario, thousands will be asked to light an
anti-apartheid candle. Those at home are invited to put a candle in
their window.
   ``We think we can make a difference,'' said Foreign Minister Joe
Clark, referring to the dominance Canada gives to the South African
issue in its foreign policy.
   The two-day meeting of the special committee of foreign
ministers will consider:
   _Canadian proposals for countering South African censorship and
propaganda through measures including the beaming of short-wave
radio broadcasts into the country from neighboring states.
   _A review of the effectiveness of economic sanctions against
South Africa and ways to broaden them.
   _A study of Pretoria's international financial links, including
gold sales, continued access to loans and the effects of corporate
divestment from South Africa.
   _And a report by Nigeria's former head of state, Maj. Gen.
Olusegun Obasanjo, on the military needs of black front-line states.
   ``There will not be dramatic progress on any question here _
it's not that kind of a meeting,'' Clark said Monday, explaining
that any recommendations must go to the entire 49-nation
Commonwealth, which meets again in Malaysia next year.
   The foreign ministers' committee was established at the last
Commonwealth summit in Vancouver in October 1987, and envoys taking
part come from Australia, Canada, Guyana, India, Nigeria, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   Britain, whose colonial past links all member countries, is
conspicuously absent because Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
opposes sanctions against South Africa.
   The British are on board, however, when it comes to military
training to neighboring Mozambique and Zimbabwe, noted Commonwealth
Secretary General Shridath Ramphal.
   Ramphal said he hoped the meeting establishes ``the machinery''
for more military training. Canada ruled out anything but
``non-lethal'' aid.
   Ramphal had reservations about Canadian proposals for countering
South African news censorship. He said it was ``too
one-dimensional'' to beam more news into the country, when getting
news out is more urgent.
   ``We have not been as energetic in getting the truth out by
non-conventional means and sources as the Western media has been in
Afghanistan,'' he said.
   South African state-of-emergency regulations in effect since
1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions,
treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of
statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the
regulations has not been comprehensive.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control the
economy and government and live apart from the 26 million blacks,
who have no vote in national affairs.

   The shadow of unemployment hangs over the
Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, birthplace of the Solidarity trade union
and once a showpiece of Polish industry.
   The trouble this time is not labor unrest, but whether the
state-owned yard will keep operating in the face of mounting money
problems and a government that says it is ready to begin shutting
down financially ailing plants.
   Solidarity activists discount the possibility that the yard will
shut down, but management and representatives of official worker
organizations believe it is a real possiblity.
   A strike at the yard May 2-10, led by Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, ended without a settlement. Workers were demanding free
trade unions and higher wages.
   During the strike, management announced that it was unable to
qualify for new state subsidies or credits from the national bank,
and it said the yard's future would have to be decided by the
Ministry of Industry.
   ``We are going on with production without a single zloty (less
than a penny) in the cash box,'' the weekly newspaper Zycie
Gospodarcze recently quoted shipyard director Czeslaw Tolwinski as
saying. The newspaper described the yard as a ``giant on partly
rotten legs.''
   The shipyard is a jumbled heap of docks, aging buildings and
huge cranes towering over a series of Vistula River tributaries and
canals near the heart of this centuries-old Baltic port city.
   It will produce only 11 ships this year, down from the annual
high of 27 that it made in the late 1970s.
   The number of workers, too, has dropped, with only about 5,000
involved in direct production.
   Ironically, says yard foreign trade manager Ireneusz Kubiczek,
the yard could produce more ships and has customers clamoring for
them. But a lack of manpower is preventing it from exploiting its
physical capacity.
   Whether the yard makes or loses money is a debatable question
because so much depends on arbitrarily set tax regulations,
material costs and credit rates which fluctuate widely and are
beyond the shipyard's control, said Jerzy Bukowicz, president of
the worker's self-management council. The council's job is to help
run the shipyard along with management.
   But in a sign of confidence, 11 hulls were launched this year in
order to have work for next year, he said.
   Officials say the strike cost 500,000 hours of labor, which must
be made up by overtime and higher productivity. Workers got pay
increases June 1, but management says the increases were planned
before the strike.
   The increases were slightly higher than the 40 percent raise the
government said could be allowed in response to price increases
imposed this year. Pay now averages about 50,000 zlotys ($111) a
month and is structured to provide incentive for harder workers,
said Waldemar Langer, a leader of the yard's official trade union.
   Despite the improvement, the yard's main trouble is that it
cannot attract a sufficient work force, said Kubiczek.
   ``We have lost 5,000 workers from the early 1980s until now,''
he said. ``It is our own near-tragedy. We have survived the most
difficult years of the crisis in shipbuilding, and now the market
is reviving. And we have clients willing to place orders.''
   As an example, Kubiczek cited a timber-carrying ship ordered by
the Soviet Union. The yard has been able to contract to produce
only 12 of the vessels, while the Soviets need 150, he said.
   The Soviet Union is by far the yard's biggest customer. A sign
inside the 343-acre facility says 575 out of 881 ships produced
there have been for the Soviets.
   With more workers, the yard could nearly double production,
Kubiczek said.
   But instead, workers are going to smaller private companies or
cooperatives where they can make more money and work indoors.
   As a state-owned company, said Kubiczek, the shipyard is unable
to raise wages dramatically because it would be hit with a punitive
tax designed to fight wage inflation. It is one example of how
national economic policies have hurt the yard, he said.
   Poland's frequently changing strategies to deal with its ailing
economy have taken a toll in other ways, he said.
   ``At least once a year, every year, we are confronted with a new
set of regulations and modifications of these rules for economic
reform, while our commitments extend out many years ahead.
   ``It makes it practically impossible to predict whether the
contract we sign today, which seems to be profitable, will in fact
be practical,'' he said.
   One of the people who does not believe the yard will close is
long-time Gdansk Solidarity activist Bogdan Borusewicz.
   ``First of all, someone has to build ships for the Russians.
Secondly, nobody really knows whether the Gdansk shipyard is making
profit or losing money, because the prices for materials and
components, such as steel plating and engines, are not market
prices really,'' he said.
   The yard has a history of worker militancy. In December 1970
protests over food prices, an unknown number of employees were
fatally shot by security forces. A towering monument to them,
erected outside the main gate, was one result of the August 1980
strike at the yard that catapulted Solidarity and Walesa to
worldwide fame.
   The inconclusive May strike showed that tensions persist,
especially among younger workers.
   Indeed, a decision to close the yard would likely set off a new
round of unrest.
   ``It is my firm belief that the workers themselves would not
allow it,'' said Grzegorz Szrejder, a 27-year-old welder active in
Solidarity.

   U.S. and Soviet diplomats opened talks Sunday on
southern Africa and its racial conflicts in preparation for a new
round of four-nation negotiations aimed at bringing peace to the
region.
   Cuban, Angolan, South African and U.S. delegations are to resume
talks here Tuesday on the future of Angola and South-West Africa, a
territory controlled by South Africa's white-minority governmet.
That session is scheduled to last three days and is the fifth
publicly announced round since negotiations were started in London
last April.
   Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, conferred with Soviet deputy foreign minister Anatoly
Adamishin for 3{ hours Sunday at the Soviet mission. No details
were given of their their talks that are set to end Monday.
   The four-nation conference will attempt to build on a set of
principles initialed by Cuba, Angola and South Africa at a meeting
July 13 in New York.
   That accord commits the parties to seek a timetable for South
Africa to relinquish control over South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, under a U.N. plan for the territory to gain its
independence.
   South Africa has been battling guerrillas of the South-West
African People's Organization for control of the territory for more
than a decade. South Africa accuses Angola's Marxist governmment of
harboring and supporing the guerrillas and has frequently sent its
troops into southern Angola.
   South Africa and the United States support anti-communist
guerrillas of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) who have been fighting the government since they
were defeated in a civil war by the Marxists after Angola won
independence from Portugal in November 1975.
   Cuba is participating in the talks because it has more than
40,000 military personnel in Angola helping the government fight
the rebels.
   South Africa has said it would not grant independence to Namibia
until the Cuban forces are withdrawn. South Africa has administered
Namibia, a former German territory, since the end of World War I
under a mandate by the defunct League of Nations. The United
Nations repudiated that mandate and South Africa rejected U.N.
resolutions calling for indpendence and free elections in the
territory.
   Crocker on July 20 called the agreement on principles an
important step but said ``there are a great many hard and difficult
compromises to be achieved.''
   Previous rounds in the talks included sessions in London, Cairo
and New York and a meeting of top military officers from the four
sides in the Cape Verde Islands.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Try To Score Points on This Year's Hot Issue: Day
Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a few minutes to spare in a long
campaign day, Michael Dukakis stopped by the Harmony Early Learning
Center to shake a few hands with preschoolers.
   Looking to campaign on a tight preconvention budget, George Bush
a day later rode out to Tysons Corner, Va., in the Washington
suburbs to do the same thing, tossing a foam ball and pushing
youngsters on a tire swing.
   For both it was time well spent. Dukakis was rewarded with
prominent photographs in newspapers and the television networks;
and Bush reaped similar coverage.
   The twin events on the presidential campaign trail last week
underscored what already has become apparent to both campaigns:
Child care is a hot issue in the 1988 race for the White House.
   It's politics dictated by demographics. The Census Bureau says
more than half of new mothers go back to work before their children
are a year old.
   Neither party wants to find itself outmaneuvered on the issue.
Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, and Bush, who will become the
Republican nominee in less than three weeks, have introduced
competing proposals on day care.
   The proposals reflect their differing philosophies on government
involvement, yet, importantly, both candidates support in principle
some form of government initiatives to assist parents in providing
care for their young children.
   ``We can ignore the fact that most women with small children now
hold jobs, or we can work to make quality, affordable child care
available to every family that needs it,'' Dukakis said.
   ``You have to have choice, parental choice, family choice, and
you have to have diversity,'' Bush said.
   The vice president's plan is basically a $1,000-per-child tax
break for low-income parents of children 4 and under.
   It would cost an estimated $2.2 billion a year, and in its first
stages would benefit only families earning less than $12,000 a
year, according to Bush domestic affairs adviser Deborah Steelman.
Eventually families earning up to $20,000 would benefit.
   Bush's plan generally would exclude the middle-class families
that pay $100 a week or so to put a child in the centers the two
presidential candidates visited last week in New Jersey and
Virginia.
   Dukakis' plan, according to his aides, largely is embodied in
legislation now before Congress that is similar to day care
assistance being provided in his own state of Massachusetts. It is
aimed at helping low- and moderate-income families afford child
care, and would reserve 75 percent of its money for that aid.
   States could use the rest to encourage developing and upgrading
centers through grants. It would establish standards for care, and
states would have to match a portion of the federal money.
   ``It isn't just that day care isn't affordable, it's that it
isn't available,'' said Dukakis aide Victoria Rideout.
   The legislation would cost an estimated $2.5 billion. But
Dukakis has stopped short of committing himself to paying that full
amount, instead saying that would be only a goal.
   ``Until I walk into the office and take a good hard look at the
books ... it's impossible to put an exact dollar figure on it,'' he
said.
   Dukakis aides fault the Bush plan because it provides money with
the filing of tax returns, not when money is spent paying day care
bills.
   Dukakis also objects to permitting the tax credit for all who
are eligible even if the family keeps the child at home, and he
says Bush would pile a tax break on top of his proposed cut in
capital gains.
   Bush contends, however, that offering the tax break to all
families who qualify would help parents who chose to have one
spouse stay at home.
   ``I am absolutely convinced he problem is so big and so diverse
that the federal government alone cannot have a bricks and mortar
child care program that's going to be effective,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis has drawn some large
crowds in the two campaign swings he's taken since leaving Atlanta
as the Democratic presidential nominee. Invariably, he has
attracted protesters too.
   At virtually every stop in his campaign travels, Dukakis has
been confronted by demonstrators, sometimes numbering no more than
a dozen, but always vocal. Most carry signs and chant slogans
objecting to the right of women to have abortions.
   Often mixed with them are signs supporting Republican George
Bush, and there are occasional signs attacking Dukakis' record in
Massachusetts, such as the one in Sturtevant, Wis., last week that
said: ``Michael Dukakis, the criminal's choice, go home.'' It
referred to the program, since modified, allowing prison furloughs
for some convicted murderers in Massachusetts.
   The presence of anti-abortion protesters recalls the campaign in
1984 of vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro, who faced
similar demonstrations at many speeches. Dukakis campaign staffers,
many of whom are veterans of the Mondale-Ferraro effort, say they
and their candidate are not bothered or surprised by the protesters.
   ``We expect them at every event,'' said Jim Steinberg, Dukakis'
senior issues adviser who travels with the candidate.
   The largest gathering, numbering 100 or more, confronted Dukakis
as he went to church on Sunday a week ago in St. Louis. In
Secaucus, N.J., last week, the dozen or so protesters positioned
themselves so close behind the stage that their chants were picked
up by the public address system _ and Dukakis had to walk right by
them as he left.
   In Sturtevant a day later, a larger group chanted slogans
throughout his speech, and Dukakis appeared to have been put off
his stride by the distraction.
   Was he rattled?
   ``Rattled? I didn't feel rattled. Did I look rattled? I didn't
feel rattled. Did I look rattled? Terribly rattled?
   ``Let me tell you, If you went through the kind of governorship
I went through in the first four years as governor of
Massachusetts, that's a day at the beach,'' added Dukakis. He was
turned out of office after that turbulent first term, in 1978, then
regained it four years later.

   Dukakis' Greek heritage and sometimes bland style prompted
humorist Mark Russell to pin the name ``Zorba the clerk'' on
Dukakis. Last week in Wisconsin, Dukakis found a phrase on a
supporter's placard that he seemed to like better.
   ``Zeus on the loose,'' it said, in reference to the supreme
deity of the ancient Greeks.
   Dukakis picked that one out of the crowd as he stood on the
platform beginning his speech. ``I don't know what that means,'' he
told the audience. But he said he would tell his wife Kitty about
it.

   Since leaving Atlanta, Dukakis has rarely failed to mention to
audiences that 25-year-old snow blower of his. It was first
displayed to the nation by cousin Olympia Dukakis, the actress, in
a campaign film aired as part of the Democratic National Convention.
   It has become, he said, a symbol of the efficient frugality he
embodies. Mentioning the snow blower sometimes seemed a bit out of
place with the setting as he campaigned in 90 degree and 100 degree
temperatures, such as inside the hot Dorton Arena in Raleigh, N.C.,
on Saturday. But he did _ and noted that he not only still has the
machine, he still has its owners manual.

   It may not be at the top of most voters' lists of concerns in a
president, but journalists always want to know what a new president
has in mind for frequency of news conferences.
   When asked that question in local television interviews in
Springfield, Ill., Dukakis said, ``I would expect two, three, four
times a week I would be meeting with the press, taking questions.''

   The Republican National Convention should help
George Bush cut into Michael Dukakis' advantage in the public
opinion polls if historical trends hold up, political analysts say.
   Several national political pollsters said they expected Dukakis
would enjoy a surge in the polls coming out of the Democratic
National Convention, and they said that would be in keeping with
past post-convention poll trends.
   But these experts also said that because of this tendency for
candidates to get a public opinion lift from all of the exposure,
Bush should be able to use the GOP extravaganza in New Orleans Aug.
15-18 to help his standing.
   While Bush could take some solace from such a boost, analysts
noted that history often has shown these post-convention spurts to
be short-lived.
   For the moment, Dukakis has a commanding lead. He was ahead by
17 percentage points in two polls last week, 18 points in two
others. Survey results just before the July 18-22 convention had
ranged from a dead heat to a slim Dukakis lead.
   But what would have been a remarkable surge any other week was
routine by post-convention standards. Conventions traditionally
boost the nominee by 10 or more points, mainly because of the
intense positive exposure they provide.
   ``The bounce Dukakis got seems to be pretty typical of what
we've seen in the past three elections,'' said Larry Hugick,
political poll chief for the Gallup Organization. ``It would be
remarkable if he didn't get a bounce.''
   ``The polls are accurate. The question is, are they predictive
of what will happen on election day,'' said Harrison Hickman, a
Democratic pollster. ``There is no question that the race will
tighten up.''
   If getting the bounce is easy, keeping it is not. Gallup polls
in recent elections showed convention surges settling as the
campaigns progressed and voters began paying more attention to the
issues:
   _Jimmy Carter went from a 17-percentage-point lead over
President Ford before the 1976 Democratic convention to a 33-point
lead after it. But within a month his lead was down to 13 points,
and he won in November by just 2.1 points.
   _In 1980, Ronald Reagan went from a 3-point lead over Carter
before the Republican convention to a 16-point lead after it. A
month later it was a tie, though Reagan went on to win by 9.7
percentage points.
   _In 1984, Walter Mondale moved up from a 14-point deficit before
the convention to a 2-point deficit just after it. But Ronald
Reagan soon made it back, and won the election by a landslide 18.2
points.
   With that history in mind, Dukakis pollster Irwin Harrison said
he viewed the bounce more as an opportunity than an accomplishment.
``The idea is to work as hard as you can to solidify what you got
from the convention,'' he said.
   Conversely, the bounce puts pressure on the Bush campaign to
counterpunch effectively at the Republican National Convention this
month.
   If Bush cannot match Dukakis' post-convention poll bounce, ``it
certainly does not augur well for an election success,'' said Lance
Tarrance, a Republican pollster based in Houston.
   ``If they don't bring enough back to cancel out that bounce from
the Democrats, then they're digging themselves into a deeper
hole,'' Tarrance said. ``They'll have to rely on a more negative
campaign,'' a risky fall strategy that could alienate voters.
   The Republicans' task could be tough. Hickman, the Democratic
pollster, said the nominee of the party in power often gains less
of a convention boost because he generally is well known and has
fewer voters to persuade.
   Hickman also noted another historical pattern: In eight of the
past 10 presidential elections, the summertime leader went on to
win.
   ``You're better off, if you're the candidate who's made the
first good impression,'' he said.

   A pickup truck in the wrong lane collided Sunday with a van in a
flaming crash that left five people dead and six critically injured
in Dallas, and six were killed in Indiana when a car flew out of
control and crashed during a drag race, police said.
   Police in Marion, Ind., said they were searching for a second
car involved in the race about 5:50 p.m. on a one-way, two-lane
corridor.
   In Dallas, five passengers of the van were dead at the scene,
while the four other people in the van and both occupants of the
pickup truck were critically injured, police said.
   The pickup was westbound in the eastbound lane at the time of
the collision about 4:45 p.m., police said. The van was knocked
backward off the road, then burst into flames, but passersby got
four of the occupants out of the vehicle, officials said.
   The dead were identified as Martin Becerra, 26, of Dallas; his
daughter, Julia, no age available; Remundo Rodriguez and his wife,
Erma Rodriguez, no ages available; and their son, Hermando
Rodriguez, 10.
   Also in the van were Ovuula Becerra, 27; Jessica Becerra, 2;
Martin Becerra Jr., 1; and Erica Rodriguez, 7, police and hospital
officials said. The occupants of the pickup were identified as
driver Mario Hernandez, no age available, and Elias Carapia, 20, of
Dallas.
   Investigators believe the Chevrolet Nova that crashed in Marion
went out of control and struck a utility pole, became airborne and
hit a tree before landing, officers said.
   Two people in the car were thrown from the vehicle when it
struck the tree, and the car landed on top of them, officers said.
   Jack Morris of Kokomo, Ind., said he was working on a truck
parked on the street when the vehicle that crashed missed him by
about 3 feet.
   ``The white car came skidding down the street (and) hit the
stump on the right side of the road,'' said Morris. ``He took out
the pole, he hit the tree, spun around, and I saw people flying.''
   The ages and the identities of those killed and the status of
the one person injured were not immediately available.

   Two former Republican congressmen,
including one who says that if AIDS isn't ``the wrath of God ... it
should be,'' are battling for a chance to topple liberal Democratic
Sen. Donald Riegle.
   But neither Jim Dunn nor Robert Huber has managed to generate
much enthusiasm and both are financing their campaigns largely with
their own money.
   In contrast, Riegle, Michigan's senior senator, has $4 million
in campaign funds, wide backing, and a 22-year record in Washington
as he faces Tuesday's Democratic primary unopposed.
   Dunn and Huber want to make Riegle's liberal voting record the
issue, a strategy the 50-year-old Riegle likes because he sees that
as one of his strong points as he seeks a third six-year term.
   ``I think the experience that I've developed in the Congress and
some of the things we've helped accomplish _ helping the farmers
(hurt by floods) two years ago, and saving Chrysler and saving
Social Security _ these are all things where I took a leadership
role and we got things done,'' he said.
   He also emphasizes that he's expected to become chairman of the
Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee if he is
re-elected Nov. 8.
   Dunn and Huber contend Riegle's record, including a 100 percent
score in a recent voting survey by the liberal public policy group
Americans for Democratic Action, means his views aren't in line
with those of most Michigan voters.
   ``He's a big spender. He's voted for cutting defense and for
giving up the Panama Canal, and that turned out to be a big
disaster,'' said Huber. ``He's been taking campaign funds from all
over the United States. Those are things I think people are going
to be pretty fed up with.''
   A Detroit Free Press-WXYZ-TV poll released July 18 showed that
of the likely Republican voters, 55 percent hadn't decided which
candidate they would support in the primary.
   That is reflected in the financing for the two campaigns.
Contributions to Huber's campaign between April 1 and July 13
totaled $846. He has loaned his campaign $221,000.
   Dunn reported contributions of $39,283, and has loaned his
campaign more than $224,000, some of which has been paid back.
   Huber, a conservative making his fourth try for the nomination,
has portrayed himself as a staunch Reagan Republican. Specifically,
he's for preserving federal income tax cuts, a strong defense,
using more federal muscle in the war on drugs, and against abortion.
   AIDS came to the fore after Dunn mentioned it in a radio
interview last week as a subject about which he and his opponent
differed.
   ``I take a reasonable, rational, I think very responsible
approach to the problems that face this nation,'' Dunn said. ``Mr.
Huber has said that the reason people have AIDS is the wrath of
God, punishment from God'' of homosexuals and drug users.
   ``Jim Dunn does not think AIDS is the wrath of God,'' he said
later.
   Huber, asked about Dunn's remarks, said ``I don't know whether
it's the wrath of God, but if it isn't it should be.''
   Huber, 65, has been the mayor of the Detroit suburb of Troy, a
state senator and a congressman. He was defeated in a re-election
bid in 1974 by now-Gov. James Blanchard.
   Dunn, 44, an East Lansing homebuilder, holds more moderate
views. During his term in Congress, 1981-82, Dunn supported most of
Reagan's tax cut and budget reduction policies, but often opposed
the administration on social issues and cuts in aid to college
students.
   Observers favor Dunn in the primary because he has the support
of most of the GOP regulars and moderates.
   The Free Press-WXYZ poll found Huber ahead of Dunn, 26 percent
to 19 percent, but Dunn's lead was within the poll's margin of
error of 8.4 percentage points, and both trailed the number
undecided. This portion of the July 11-13 telephone survey was
conducted among 137 people who described themselves as likely
Republican primary voters.
   Another portion of the poll found Riegle had a 51 percent to 19
percent lead over either Dunn or Huber, with 30 percent of the
voters undecided. That survey of 598 people who described
themselves as likely primary voters had a margin of error of 4
percentage points.

   ``I feel a void. There's not a total emptiness, but I feel
something's missing,'' Murphy said in an interview published in
this week's People magazine.
   ``No matter how much you accomplish, how much money you make, or
how many cars or houses you have or how many people you make happy,
life isn't perfect for anybody.''
   Is it romance that's missing?
   ``I'm in a cool place right now. I don't have someone who is my
woman,'' said Murphy, 27. ``I have a couple of friends. That's
where I'm at right now.''
   He finds that he and another movie star, Sylvester Stallone,
face similar problems.
   ``When I sit back with people like Stallone, we can trade
stories,'' he said. ``It's like the same identical things happen:
the way power isolates you, and everybody tries to get close to
you, and the weight of being the patriarch in your family. It's
just a bunch of stuff.''

   Singer-songwriter John Stewart is
still making money off the Monkees hit, ``Daydream Believer,''
which he wrote two decades ago.
   ``It has kept me alive,'' Stewart said prior to a weekend
engagement here.
   Stewart's song sold 5 million copies and became his signature
tune. It also inspired a popular remake by Anne Murray in 1980.
   The 49-year-old performer still tours much of the year, even
though he hasn't had a hit since 1979's ``Gold.''
   His latest song, ``Runaway Train,'' sung by Rosanne Cash, dwells
on a relationship clearly out of control.
   Stewart, a former member of the Kingston Trio, hasn't had much
success with new material. His last album, ``Punch the Big Guy,''
was released in November and sold only 25,000 copies. He blames it
on poor promotion and marketing.
   There may still be another hit for him, though.
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``No one thought `Daydream
Believer' was going to be a hit.''

   Martin Scorsese says he is troubled by the stir
his forthcoming film, ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' is
creating.
   An alliance of conservative church groups has objected to the
movie's release, with pickets, organized phone and mail protests,
demonstrations and threats of a boycott.
   ``This film for me is like a prayer. It is my way of
worshiping,'' Scorsese, whose films include ``Raging Bull'' and
``The Color of Money,'' said, according to this week's People
magazine.
   The director told the magazine the idea of making the film
touched the roots of his own spirituality and became an obsession
that has dogged him throughout his career.
   In response to the backlash, Scorsese offers his view of the
movie's message: ``It's about the last battle between God and
Satan, and God wins.''

   Tennis star Chris Evert and former ski
champion Andy Mill were ending eight-year marriages when they met
19 months ago at a New Year's Eve party in Aspen, Colo. Now, they
have tied the knot.
   ``The last thing we were looking for was another romantic
relationship,'' Mill said last week. ``But the old cliche is that
when you're looking for love, you never find it.''
   On Saturday, Evert, 33, and Mill, 35, exchanged wedding vows in
a formal civil ceremony attended by 100 people.
   ``We're thrilled,'' Evert said. ``It was a very emotional
ceremony. We were both crying.''
   ``The feeling was just overwhelming,'' Mill said.
   Among those at the wedding were tennis players Martina
Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Pam Shriver and Wendy Turnbull,
entertainer Lynda Carter, body builder Rachel MacLish and race-car
driver Danny Sullivan.

   The rumpled raincoat is coming back
_ not as a fashion trend, just the one worn by that tenacious
detective from the 1970s series, ``Colombo.''
   But like most of Hollywood, actor Peter Falk is awaiting the end
of the scriptwriters' strike so work can resume on six new episodes.
   ``I don't know why people liked (that character) so much,'' Falk
said during a recent interview at his home.
   ``I like people that are abstracted, that are preoccupied with
something, so they're unaware what they look like,'' he said,
referring to the character whose exploits endeared him to millions
of TV viewers. ``Without affectation, he's genuinely absorbed by
what it is that makes the elevator light go on when you push the
button.''
   While awaiting the resumption of production, Falk is co-starring
as an amiable con man opposite Cyndi Lauper and Jeff Goldblum in
the comedy movie ``Vibes,'' which opens Friday.

   Former Pittsburgh Pirates slugger
Willie Stargell was thinking about others when he was inducted into
baseball's Hall of Fame.
   ``I did not get to Cooperstown without a network of family,
coaches, teammates and teachers, you name it,'' Stargell said
Sunday as he became the 200th player enshrined at the Hall of Fame.
``I accept this for all the people at the stadiums. The batboys,
the groundcrew, announcers and the media.''
   In 21 years with Pittsburgh, Stargell hit 475 home runs, had
1,540 runs batted in, hit .282 and helped the Pirates win the World
Series title in 1971 and '79. In the '79 Series, Stargell hit .400
with three homers and was the Most Valuable Player.
   Sportscaster Lindsey Nelson and sports columnist Jim Murray of
the Los Angeles Times also were honored Sunday during induction
ceremonies at the Hall of Fame.

<HEAD>Japanese-American Internees To Get $20,000 Tax-Free Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE GOULD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is poised this week to give final
approval to legislation providing more than $1 billion to
Japanese-Americans who were forced from their homes and sent to
internment camps during World War II.
   The House is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday, sending
it to the White House, where President Reagan is likely to sign it
into law.
   If all goes according to that schedule, Japanese-Americans who
qualify should start getting individual $20,000 tax-free payments
in about a year. The most elderly will be given priority for the
first payments.
   Enactment of the reparations bill will help end the nearly
half-century-old controversy over how the United States treated its
Japanese-American population after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor,
Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941.
   About 120,000 U.S. citizens and resident aliens of Japanese
descent were singled out _ unlike Americans of German or Italian
descent _ and sent to internment camps for the duration of the war.
   In addition to losing their freedom, some of the internees lost
jobs and possessions and were forced to sell homes at below-market
prices. In the years immediately after the war, some were
reimbursed for direct losses, such as impounded property. But
efforts to provide an across-the-board payment were delayed for
decades.
   In 1980, Congress authorized a federal Commission on Wartime
Relocation and Internment of Civilians to study the issue. In
December 1982 it released the results of its investigation,
including a recommendation that each camp survivor be given a
$20,000 tax-free payment, providing they agree to drop all related
claims against the government.
   Earlier this year, the House and Senate accepted the
recommendations and passed separate but slightly different bills
providing for the money. The differences were reconciled, and the
Senate last week approved the compromise version without dissent.
The House should do the same this week.
   Once approved by the House, the reparations package will go to
the president for his signature. B. Jay Cooper, deputy White House
press secretary, said following Senate approval that, ``They have
improved the bill a lot. A lot of our concerns have been taken care
of.''
   One of those concerns was over how many years the government
would take to make the payments. The Senate approved a five-year
payout; the White House objected, claiming it would cost too much,
too soon. As part of the compromise, the government now can take up
to 10 years to make the payments, starting in about a year.
   The House-Senate proposal also authorizes payments of up to
$12,000 for surviving members of the Aleut Indian tribes who were
removed from the Aleutian Islands during the Japanese attack on
those islands in 1942.
   ``It is most gratifying to me personally to see this long battle
for personal justice come to an end at last,'' said Sen. Spark M.
Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, sponsor of the Senate bill.
   The internment camps arose from a 1942 order by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt that said the War Department could designate
military areas from which people could be excluded.
   Later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of
Japanese ancestry from California, Washington and Oregon, and some
in Hawaii. The orders affected 77,000 U.S. citizens and 43,000
legal and illegal resident aliens. All were taken to prison camps
in the Western states.
   The last camp was closed in January 1946.
   In all, about 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were detained
in the camps, including 77,000 American citizens.
   An estimated 60,000 are still alive, and the bill would allow
them to claim the individual $20,000 payments in return for waiving
any further wartime claims against the government.
   Congress already has awarded about $38 million in restitution
payments since the passage of a 1948 Evacuation Claims law. Five
years ago, however, a federal commission estimated that
Japanese-Americans had suffered losses of up to $2 billion that had
never been compensated.
   About 900 Aleuts were moved from their homes and forced to live
in abandoned mines, canneries and camps about 2,000 miles away.
Lack of medical care and adequate food contributed to disease and
death, and many of their homes were destroyed or vandalized in
their absence.
   About 450 Aleuts survive and would be eligible for the $12,000
payments. Another $20 million would benefit Aleut villages and
provide for scholarships and the general welfare of the tribe.

<HEAD>Former Supreme Court Associate Justice Enjoying Busy Retirement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although he cited age and declining health
when he retired from the U.S. Supreme Court one year ago, Lewis F.
Powell Jr. shows little sign of slowing, says one associate.
   ``His idea of retirement is to stop working at 4 o'clock on
Saturday afternoon,'' said U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige
Jr., a longtime friend.
   Powell, who was a Richmond lawyer when he was tapped for the
Supreme Court in 1972 by then-President Richard Nixon, has returned
to his hometown and now maintains a modest office in the same
building as Merhige.
   Powell, who also keeps office hours in Washington, has sat with
appellate panels on three occasions since his retirement, and has
taught at the University of Virginia. This spring, he delivered
commencement addresses at George Mason University and Washington &
Lee, his alma mater.
   The only sign marking Powell's office at the U.S. Courthouse is
a room number scratched above a door frame. And the interior of his
office contains no plaques, citations or personal photographs.
   ``People wonder why I have such a Spartan office. I love it,''
Powell said last week. ``Very few people find me over here, which I
regard as a plus.''
   Powell, who turns 81 this fall, said he has no regrets about
stepping down from the nation's highest court, even though he
admits missing the intellectual challenge and the close association
with other justices.
   ``When you reach my ancient age, family is far more important
than any of the less personal things that happen to one over a long
lifetime,'' he said.
   Powell and his wife, Josephine, have four children and seven
grandchildren. Powell also describes his health as ``not
vigorous.'' Since 1979, he has undergone several operations,
including removal of a cancerous prostate in 1985.
   In June, he was hospitalized for almost a week for treatment of
a blood infection. Although his cancer has been in remission,
Powell said his health prevents him and his wife of 52 years from
extensive travel.
   Powell also takes a modest view of his role on the court,
although he was often seen during the 1980s as the moderate justice
who kept the rest of the court from drifting too far in either
direction. And last year, he was described by The New York Times as
a more powerful influence on the law than President Reagan or Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   ``If I got into a footnote, I'd be surprised,'' Powell said.
   After Powell retired last August, he avoided comment as Robert
H. Bork and Douglas H. Ginsburg failed to win Senate approval as
his successor. Eight months later, Anthony Kennedy finally won
approval.
   Powell refuses to pinpoint blame but strongly denounced the
delays in replacing him.
   ``The disappointment to me was that for the first time in many
years, the process was prolonged to the point where it was a
disservice to the Supreme Court itself,'' he said.

   Yellowstone National Park officials re-opened areas of the park
Sunday that had been closed because of forest fires, and
firefighters used hand tools to choke the last embers of a
controlled fire that destroyed 15 homes at Rapid City, S.D.
   Crews battled at least four new blazes in two national forests
in Wyoming, a wilderness fire forced evacuation of a ranger station
in Montana, and firefighters also were at work in the forests of
Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
   Fire activity in Yellowstone declined Sunday, said Costa Dillon,
fire information officer. That allowed officials to re-open the
park's south entrance north of Jackson, Wyo., closed one week ago
by the 10,100-acre Shoshone fire and the 10,600-acre Red fire.
   Officials also re-opened the park's West Thumb area Sunday,
closed Saturday when firefighters started controlled burns to
remove fuels before the Shoshone fire, which jumped the road from
the southern entrance, could reach the area.
   A controlled burn on the eastern and northeastern edge of the
11,300-acre North Fork fire, which at one point was six miles from
the tourist complex at Old Faithful geyser, had worked as planned
and flames headed north away from the geyser Sunday, Dillon said.
   Firefighters completed a containment line around 30 percent of
the fire and hoped for full containment by Wednesday, he added.
Because the fire was caused by man rather than lightning,
firefighters will attempt to control it.
   The largest fire in the park, the 68,035-acre Clover Mist, did
not grow significantly during the weekend, Dillon said.
   Elsewhere in Wyoming, two new fires in the Bighorn National
Forest kept firefighters busy, and crews in the Targhee National
Forest fought two lightning-caused blazes. The largest had covered
1,260 acres on Medicine Mountain in the Big Horn.
   A timber fire that burned 3,840 acres in the Black Hills on the
western edge of Rapid City over six days was declared controlled
Sunday night, as was a 35-acre fire that broke out nearby Saturday.
A fire is considered controlled when it is reduced to smoldering
patches.
   Mary Sue Waxler, a fire information officer, said about 584
firefighters were at the fire Sunday morning, about half the number
there 24 hours earlier.
   The remaining firefighters worked from the fire line to the
center of the burned area with hand tools and other equipment,
Waxler said.
   ``Basically, they're doing things like extinguishing embers and
turning over logs to make sure that things are out,'' she said.
   The Rock Creek fire in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area of
southwestern Montana jumped fire lines and covered about 3,000
acres Sunday, said Jack Kendley, fire information officer at the
Inter-Agency Dispatch Center in Helena. Although it was in a
wilderness area, the fire was being fought because it was
man-caused. Late Saturday, smoke from the fire could be seen in
Helena, more than 100 miles away, he said.
   In northwestern Montana, 10 to 15 people were evacuated from a
remote ranger station in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area when the
Gates fire spread to about 8,000 acres, Kendley said.
   ``That fire increased 2,000 to 3,000 acres in size'' on
Saturday, Kendley said. ``The buildings (at the station) have been
covered with fireproof tarps, a gravity-feed sprinkler system has
been installed on a nearby ridge and personnel and livestock have
been evacuated from the station.''
   Also in the Bob Marshall, the Canyon Creek blaze had grown to
15,000 acres Sunday, he said.
   In Idaho, ground crews cleared landing areas for helicopters
around the 5,000-acre Willis Gulch fire so weary firefighters can
be flown back and forth from the remote fire line in the Boise
National Forest. The heliports cut the walk for firefighters from
four miles to about a half mile.
   Containment was expected Monday evening, and by late Sunday a
containment line had been thrown around 90 percent of the fire's
10-mile perimeter, forest officials said.
   Firefighters in Washington continued work Sunday on the
3,600-acre Falls Creek fire along the crest of the Cascades, about
12 miles northeast of Mount Rainier National Park, and a smaller
burn in the Cascade foothills.
   A 75-acre fire broke out late Saturday in the Mount Hood
National Forest in Oregon and and a lightning storm sparked nearly
70 small fires in southern Oregon, forest spokeswomen said.

   Lt. Tony Rossano, one of 13 city sanitation
cops, sifts through syringes, blood vials and other disgusting
debris, hunting for the culprit who's dumping the infectious
medical waste tainting beaches in five states.
   ``It's like the detective work on a murder case,'' Rossano said.
``We're doing interviews, surveillance, followup, just good
old-fashioned police work. We trace every marked item we can.''
   These gumshoes of garbage look for names, dates and places so
they can zero in on the offending source. But most of the seaborne
slop, carried by the whims of tides, currents and winds, either has
no markings or waterlogged labels are unreadable.
   More than 1,000 items of medical waste, most of it syringes used
to inject insulin or illegal drugs, have been bagged in an evidence
trailer. Under particular scrutiny are people who were caught
dumping before.
   ``There's reason to believe we can identify the bad actors who
are illegally dumping,'' said Brendan Sexton, head of the city's
Sanitation Department.
   ``It looks like repeated dumping by a smaller user,'' said
Marlene Gold, who heads the Sanitation Department's enforcement
team of five lawyers, 13 environmental sleuths and 10 extra
officers.
   ``I don't think we're looking at large hospitals. There's no
indication of wholesale dumping,'' she said. ``It's just very hard
to reconstruct what must have happened. It's very hard to trace
this material. We're looking for people who have no regard for the
way they handle waste.''
   State and federal authorities are also part of the investigation.
   This summer's floating filth first came ashore July 6 on a Long
Island beach. Also contaminated are beaches in New Jersey,
Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
   The refuse is mostly unmarked needles and vials, several of
which tested positive for AIDS antibodies and hepatitis B virus.
   Other items included stained bandages, catheter bags, colostomy
bags, respirator parts, prescription bottles, plastic tubing for
intravenous drugs, rubber gloves and nine dead rats.
   Infectious medical wastes, treated like industrial trash, are
supposed to be placed in red bags to alert handlers of the
contents. No red bags have washed ashore.
   State investigators believe the rubbish may have come from
several sources: illegal dumpers, runoff from city storm sewers,
wind-swept garbage barges or sloppy handling of trash at city
landfills.
   ``The evidence does not point to a single incident or a single
event as a `smoking gun,''' said R.W. Groneman, spokesman for the
state Department of Environmental Conservation, which has 10
environmental police on the case.
   ``It's a big ocean,'' Groneman said. ``The midnight dumpers, the
people who might deliberately dump this stuff, don't necessarily
leave calling cards or identifying marks.''
   New York generates 1.8 million pounds of red bag waste each
week, 45 percent of which comes from New York City. Most of it is
incinerated on the spot or taken out of state for disposal.
   Groneman said the items scoured from hundreds of miles of
beaches would fill six shopping bags. ``We're not talking about
wave upon wave of red bag waste,'' he said.
   Groneman says that needles flushed down toilets by diabetics and
junkies may have been carried out to sea during a heavy rain that
overloaded the city's sewers.
   Other officials say beach debris may be inevitable.
   ``From this whole episode, we now understand that needles on the
beach are part of the ecology of New York,'' said Dr. Stephen
Joseph, the New York City Health Commissioner.
   Some seemingly promising clues have washed out.
   A prescription bottle was traced to an upstate New York man, and
hopeful authorities thought they could find who handled his trash.
But the man said he lost his pills on a fishing trip at sea.
   ``You get very excited when you see something with markings on
it. You figure you can trace it and get to the bottom of this
thing. But there are a lot of false leads,'' said Gold.
   In New Jersey, James Lyko heads a team of 13 lawyers and 25
investigators who drive along back roads trailing garbage trucks,
videotaping work at garbage transfer stations and combing through
litter.
   ``We are going to nail people for deliberate dumping,'' said
Lyko, head of the state's task force on environmental protection.
   Ocean experts say the trash may have washed out to sea from any
number of inlets, then sloshed back to a different shore.
   ``The tides along the Eastern Seaboard carry things in and out.
Once it goes out, it mixes. You don't know which inlet it came
from,'' said Coast Guard. Lt. Cmdr. Lawrence Brooks. ``Winds,
currents, rain and tide all impact on what's moving in and out.''
   In Rhode Island, authorities say they have no doubt where
unwelcome litter originated. They had 75 pieces of trash, including
a prescription bottle from a woman in Brooklyn and a sign they
believe belongs to New York City's Emergency Medical Services.
   A University of Rhode Island computer model of winds, currents
and tides during the last 30 days indicated the garbage came from
New York, according to Ronald DiOrio, an aide to Gov. Edward
DiPrete.
   ``It is all leading us back to the same general area _ New York
City,'' said DiOrio, head of the state's Task Force on Medical
Wastes. ``This is a great warning to all of us. We better be
aggressive in protecting our shoreline.''

<TEXT>
   Gazing up at the sheer limestone
north face of the Eiger, mountaineer Heinrich Harrer reminisced
about the climb 50 years ago that changed his life.
   In July 1938, he and three other climbers became the first to
scale the daunting 5,940-foot wall in the heart of the Swiss Alps
that is considered Europe's greatest challenge to mountaineers.
   ``We were never afraid. We never had any idea of returning or
giving up'' despite difficulties during the four-day adventure, the
76-year-old Harrer told The Associated Press in a recent interview.
   Nine people had already died on the wall before Harrer and Fritz
Kasparek, both Austrians, and Andreas Heckmair and Ludwig Voerg,
both Germans, set out before dawn one morning to conquer the last
virgin face of the Alps.
   Because of the danger, authorities had outlawed attempts to
climb the north face. But the four defied the ban.
   ``We climbed the wall secretly,'' said Harrer, sitting in an
Alpine meadow with a dramatic view of the north face. ``When we
came down after four days, we were surprised to find out that the
whole world knew about it.''
   It turned out that observers had spotted them.
   Harrer recently returned to Grindelwald, a village at the base
of the Eiger, for a weekend celebration with hundreds of other
mountaineers and fans on the anniversary of the climb. Another
guest of honor was 82-year-old Heckmair. Kasparek and Voerg are
both dead.
   The Eiger north face, which juts up almost vertically above
Grindelwald, lived up to its reputation that celebration weekend.
An English climber trying to scale it fell and sustained serious
head injuries, but was rescued alive by helicopter.
   Just Saturday, a 26-year-old South Korean was killed in a
3,300-foot fall as he tried to scale the Eiger's north face, the
Swiss Air Rescue Service said.
   The recent helicopter rescue recalled the most dramatic rescue
from the Eiger, the first time a climber was rescued alive.
   In 1957, before helicopters were used, Italian Claudio Corti was
saved at an icy patch three-quarters of the way up the wall. But
his countryman Stefano Longhi froze to death and his body hung from
his rope, out of reach of rescuers, for two years.
   It was only when winches were put in place in 1959 that the
corpse could be retrieved.
   Harrer said that after 50 years, public interest in the Eiger
and the historic first climb has actually increased.
   ``This wall has developed a certain kind of charisma, a mythical
attraction,'' he says.
   Since the 1938 climb, about 700 mountaineers have successfully
ascended the wall using various routes to get to the peak 13,101
feet above sea level.
   Harrer said the fact that so many have climbed the north face
does not diminish the challenge.
   ``Fifty people have died on that wall, which proves that the
wall hasn't become easier,'' he said.
   But he added, ``it has become easier provided you are an expert,
provided you are equipped properly, provided you have prepared this
climb and chosen the proper time to do it.''
   In a book he wrote about his ascent, Harrer tells how he and his
partners waited for days, watching the weather around the Eiger,
before picking the best moment to begin their climb.
   The climbers nourished themselves mostly with hot tea and cocoa.
Harrer said his only solid food during the climb was a slice of
bread and butter that his mother had given him 14 days earlier, as
he left home after taking his university exams.
   ``I didn't tell her where I was going, just that I was going
climbing,'' he said.
   The most tense moments of the 1938 climb came on the third day,
when the mountaineers clung to the nearly vertical face to
withstand avalanches, hailstorms and snowstorms.
   ``This is part of the Eiger north wall,'' Harrer said.
   He said he was not afraid. ``Once you start action, you are on
the wall, you never think of any danger.''
   Yet he said that before reaching the wall, one always has ``some
thoughts that you could return now, it is not too late.''
   ``But it's very simple. If you don't overcome fear, you will
never be prepared to do something exceptional.''

<HEAD>River Overflows, Leaving Two Dead, 12 Missing</HEAD>

   Heavy weekend rains sent a river over
its banks and triggered a mudslide that destroyed nearly 100 houses
in a coastal resort and left two people dead and 12 missing,
officials said.
   The Chichiriviche river overflowed after a downpour Saturday
night, causing a mudslide that covered several of the houses ``up
to their roofs,'' civilian Defense Director Freddy Paris told the
official news agency Venpres.
   ``There is mud up to five meters (yards) high. It is likely
there are more victims in there and we are working to find those
missing,'' he said Sunday.
   Paris said the houses belonged to people vacationing in the
Caribbean resort 25 miles north of Caracas near La Guaira port.
   The flooding was the worst since last September, when a mudslide
caused by a downpour in another coastal area killed hundreds of
vacationers.

<HEAD>Forest Fires Are Essential to Natural Diversity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forest fires, even the big ones that hit
Yellowstone National Park last week, are an essential part of
nature's cycle of death and renewal. Humans unwittingly rearranged
a lot of nature's handiwork before realizing that.
   ``We almost lost the loblolly pine'' in the Southeast in the
1920s and 1930s because of the insistence of the Forest Service in
suppressing all fires, says Gene Wood, a wildlife ecologists at
Auburn University.
   Such a no-fire policy lets hardwood species get established, and
once established the hardwoods can out-compete the pine, Wood said.
   Traditionally, lightning or Indians, who set fires for hunting
or farming, would always start enough fires to keep hardwoods down,
he said.
   When Wisconsin was settled around 1830, two-thirds of the state
was prairie, one-third forest. Humans fought prairie fires. Now the
state is two-thirds forest, with special organizations trying to
save the prairie chicken _ and setting fires to keep the prairie
vigorous.
   Though specifics differ according to soils, weather and species
_ fire has been far more important in forest evolution in the arid
West than elsewhere _ natural fires caused by lightning are usually
small. Without harming trees very much they prevent litter from
leaves, dead limbs, twigs and other organic matter from building up.
   Fire ``recycles the nutrients and you get a diversity of
wildlife species,'' said Jim Gillette, deputy regional director of
the Fish and Wildlife Service in Boston.
   His agency probably sets 400 fires a year, ranging from 100
acres to 2,000, acres on its 443 refuges and other installations.
   In some ecosystems, rigid suppression of natural fires means
enormous amounts of fuel can accumulate on the forest floor. When
the inevitable lightning does strike, the fire can be impossible to
suppress and more destructive than anything that would have
happened naturally.
   In some areas like the Great Lakes, damp soils kept fires from
getting started on the forest floor. When a fire would start in a
dry cycle, maybe once a century, it would spread to the crowns and
sweep all before it. ``You have selection for species that can
recover,'' said Wood. ``It takes a long, long time.''
   A fire in California sequoia tree crowns in 1955, where the
floor normally would burn every decade or so, prompted a
re-examination of the ``fight every fire'' policy by the National
Park Service.
   By 1968 the service was igniting the undercover in the Sequoia
National Park, trying to return the forest to its natural state. In
1972 it adopted what has been called a ``let burn'' policy.
   ``We were almost killing the trees with kindness,'' before that,
said Chief Ranger Walt Dabney.
   The new policy had been long germinating from research dating to
the 1930s, said Wood, some of whose research helped spread the
gospel. ``A lot of the old foresters and game wardens could have
tarred and feathered me,'' he said.
   Strictly speaking, ``let burn'' is a misnomer. Dabney said the
policy always contemplated case-by-case decisions. Fires that
threaten structures are always fought. Fires that might be left
alone would be fought if they could spread outside the park, into
commercial timbering, for example.
   The use of fire by humans is exactly analogous to the use of
human hunters to replace a predator and maintain nature's balance,
Gillette said.
   Last week's fires in Yellowstone National Park, which involved
about 5 percent of the park's acreage, were of a severity seen only
once every 200 years to 400 years or so. Instead of fighting only
blazes threatening park installations, firefighters turned to
attacking almost every outbreak before waiting to see what it might
threaten _ it might be too late to put down the fire when its
course became clear, and it takes far fewer fighters to do that
early.
   A big fire does more than clear the floor; it opens the forest.
Sunlight reaches the ground. Creatures like owls appear, living in
forest but doing their hunting in the open area.
   Some tree species need fire to burst cones and scatter seeds.
Seeds germinate into fledgling trees. In Yellowstone, elk have
nothing to eat in the mature forest, but will graze on the growth
in the open area.
   ``In a couple of years you'll see a green situation, with food
for the elk,'' Cutler said.
   Examples could be multiplied _ in northern Michigan, blueberry
bushes appear after fires. Bears like blueberries, so more bears
appear. Eventually, something else succeeds the blueberry bushes,
and the bears decline.
   The difficulty with a ``let-burn'' policy is the exceptions,
Wood noted: ``Someone will always say: I realize (the policy), but
we can't let this one burn. ... It would be nice if these things
all started two-thirds of the way up to the mountain and just
burned their way to the top, but they don't.''

<HEAD>Caribbean Commodity Exports Benefit Under U.S. Trade Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old U.S. policy of giving trade
preference to small Caribbean nations has helped turn American
supermarket produce counters into exotic garden spots where
pineapples, melons and other fruit are in abundant supply.
   The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 gave 27
countries duty-free access to U.S. markets for 12 years, beginning
in 1984.
   An Agriculture Department report takes a look at the Caribbean
Basin Initiative, or CBI, and concludes that its impact on U.S.
imports of 75 horticultural products has been mixed, with some
notable successes and some failures.
   The report said CBI ``improved the competitive position of all
but a few products that were specifically excluded,'' such as
selected textiles, leather goods, canned tuna, crude and refined
petroleum products and watch parts.
   After Congress passed the law in 1983, the report said, there
was ``a wave of optimism'' that led to a search for new U.S. market
opportunities, with producers looking specifically at growth
potential for horticultural products.
   The value of horticultural products imported from CBI countries
rose to $666 million in 1987 from $459 million in 1983, a 45
percent increase. When bananas, beer and ale are excluded, the
imports of remaining products more than doubled to $191.2 million
from $91.1 million.
   Fresh pineapples accounted for about 12 percent of the $191.2
million in import value over the four years, the report said. Other
commodities included: frozen concentrated orange juice, 5.1
percent; cantaloupes, 4.3 percent; other melons, mostly honeydews,
7.1 percent; mangoes, 2.5 percent; and frozen broccoli, 4.8 percent.
   The 75 products reviewed accounted for about half the $191.2
million, the report said. Products not among the 75, but still
important as CBI exports to the United States, included live
plants, peas, yams, sweet potatoes and dasheens, or taro.
   The analysis was prepared by economists Boyd Buxton and Richard
Brown of the department's Economic Research Service and was
included in the August issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   Nine products from the CBI countries showed strong gains after
1983. Exports to the United States of pineapples, cantaloupes and
other melons increased to more than 6,000 metric tons per through
1987.
   The CBI share of U.S. pineapple imports, for example, increased
to 97 percent in 1987 from 57 percent in 1983. Other melons
increased to 45 percent from 24 percent, and cantaloupes to 21
percent from 7 percent.
   ``Costa Rica and Honduras were the principal sources of fresh
pineapples, while Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Panama were
the big gainers for cantaloupe and honeydew exports,'' the report
said. ``Also showing strong gains were frozen broccoli, fresh
celery, onions and roses (largely from Guatemala), frozen
concentrated orange juice (mostly from Belize) and fresh okra from
the Dominican Republic.''
   A category of ``medium gainers'' among 1983-87 imports from CBI
countries included watermelons, frozen strawberries and fresh
strawberries from Guatemala; grapefruit from the Bahamas; mangos
from Haiti; and coconut meat from the Dominican Republic.
   The Bahamas now account for 99 percent of the grapefruit
imported from CBI countries, the report said. Even so, total
imports account for less than 1 percent of the annual U.S.
grapefruit supply.
   Products said to show ``weak gains'' since 1983 included
tomatoes, which increased almost 1,800 metric tons annually but
were only about 1 percent of the total volume of tomatoes imported
by the United States last year. Nearly all the CBI tomatoes came
from the Dominican Republic.
   Lemon imports from the Bahamas grew about 600 tons annually and
accounted for 16 percent of total U.S. lemon imports in 1987, up
from only 1 percent in 1983, the report said. Other products
showing weak gains were pineapple juice concentrate, frozen peas,
squash, garlic and peppers.
   The report said products in the ``loser'' category _ meaning
imports from the CBI countries declined _ included green beans,
cucumbers, eggplant, frozen cauliflower and frozen okra.
   ``Duty-free status does not ensure success for CBI products in
U.S. markets,'' the report said. ``Strong competition exists from
Mexico for many fresh vegetables, and from Chile and other Southern
Hemisphere countries for fresh fruits and juices.''
   The report added: ``Competing with other regions by delivering
fresh, high-quality fruits and vegetables to U.S. markets involves
developing a closely coordinated production, processing,
transportation and distribution network.''
   Much time and relatively large investments are needed to plan,
develop and carry out new ventures in regions such as the Caribbean
``where social, political and geographic handicaps, as well as
years of colonial neglect, have hindered the development of dynamic
and self-sustaining market economies,'' the report said.
   But growth in the export capability of CBI countries has begun
and probably will continue, the report said, adding that ``Congress
has already hinted it might extend the CBI beyond the first 12-year
period to provide a longer planning horizon and investment recovery
period.''

<TEXT>
   Waiters, cashiers and others with little control
over demanding jobs face an added heart attack risk about as big as
that from smoking or high cholesterol, a study of nearly 5,000 men
suggests.
   The study found that male workers in the top 10 percent for such
``job strain'' had 3.8 to 4.8 times the heart attack risk of men in
the bottom 10 percent.
   A second analysis found that men in the top 20 percent for job
strain, a list that included cooks, gas station attendants and
firemen, had 2.5 to 3.3 times the risk of the rest of the workers
studied.
   Each analysis gave two numbers because it was performed on two
groups of men. The ``true'' answer probably lies about halfway in
between, said Robert Karasek, associate professor in the industrial
and systems engineering department at the University of Southern
California.
   Employers may be able to redesign high-strain jobs to lower
heart attack risk and improve productivity, said Karasek.
   Karasek reports the study in August's American Journal of Public
Health, along with co-authors from Sweden, the State University of
New York at Stony Brook, Cornell University Medical School and
Columbia University.
   The results are impressive, said David Krantz, professor of
medical psychology at the Uniformed Services University of the
Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.
   Job strain was defined as the result of having too little
control over one's work to deal satisfactorily with its
psychological demands, such as having to work quickly and facing
heavy workloads.
   Executives were not considered under heavy strain because they
have control to deal with demands, Karasek said.
   The study was based on heart attacks as reported by men in two
federal surveys. Too few women with heart attacks appeared in those
surveys for a meaningful analysis of them, Karasek said.
   The Health Examination Survey done in 1960-61, found 39 heart
attacks among 2,409 employed men. The Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, done from 1971 to 1975, uncovered 30 heart
attacks among 2,424 employed men.
   To assess job characteristics for all 4,833 men, researchers
used federal studies of the conditions faced by workers of various
kinds of jobs. Measurements for various job traits, such as control
over the work, were computed for 221 occupations.
   These measurements were then adjusted for each worker based on
his age, race, education, geographic region, and whether or not he
was self-employed or worked in a city.
   The comparison of heart attacks in men with the most versus the
least job strain took into account the heart attack risk factors of
age, race, cigarette use, education, blood pressure and cholesterol
levels.
   Jobs in the top 10 percent for strain included cashiers and
waiters, while those in the bottom 10 percent included foresters,
natural scientists and civil engineers.
   The other analysis, of men in the top 20 percent versus the
other 80 percent, took into account only the worker ages, which
Karasek said was the most important influence on heart attack risk.
   Job strain appeared to account for between a fourth and a third
of heart attacks in an analysis that took only age into account.
Karasek said the results were similar when the other risk factors
also were considered.
   The study does not prove that job strain raises the risk of
heart attacks, Karasek said, but the idea is supported by other
research.
   In the new study, researchers did not know whether workers were
in their reported jobs when the heart attack occurred. But it is
unlikely that a worker would have a heart attack in a low-strain
job and later move into a high-strain one, Karasek said.
   It may take 10 to 15 years of high job strain before a heart
attack would occur, he said.
   Giving workers more control has long been advocated to increase
productivity, he said. It may also reduce job strain, along with
letting workers use underutilized skills and making their jobs
platforms for learning new skills, he said.
   Karasek said overall job strain probably includes factors the
study overlooked, such as job insecurity and psychological support
from other people.
   Krantz said the ``very promising'' job strain hypothesis should
be tested by research that measures each worker's job strain
directly, follows him over time and takes the various risk factors
into account.

<HEAD>Airlines Don't Have Enough Blacks in Cockpits, Boardrooms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks are underrepresented in the cockpits
and corporate offices of the nation's airlines, according to a
congressional report that says air carriers actually may be going
backwards in their affirmative action efforts.
   Blacks hold about 5 percent of the managerial jobs at the
airlines, and no more than 200 of the 45,000 pilots in the industry
are black, said the report released Sunday by the House Government
Operations Committee.
   ``Blacks are making little progress in the airline industry
overall and, at certain airlines have actually regressed,'' Rep.
Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the panel's subcommittee on
transportation, said.
   The report said blacks represent 30 percent of the industry's
unskilled workers. However, they constitute less than 2 percent of
all airline professionals, it said.
   The report caps an investigation by the subcommittee that
included three hearings and a review of records maintained by
federal agencies as well as company documents on minority hiring
and promotion.
   The panel said the report, in particular, discusses equal
employment opportunity and affirmative action policies and
practices at Trans World Airlines, United Airlines and American
Airlines.
   ``The testimony and documents received by the subcommittee
suggest that the airline industry has downgraded affirmative action
efforts, particularly with respect to black pilots, managers and
other professionals,'' the report said.
   It said civil rights laws, court rulings and other factors had
brought a measure of integration to the airlines.
   But it added that ``the industry pattern is one in which blacks
continue to be overrepresented in low-wage, semiskilled and
unskilled positions and continue to be underrepresented in
positions requiring advanced education, specialized training and
skill.''
   Bob Jackson, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an
industry trade group, said in an interview Sunday, ``All of the
major airlines have positive minority hiring programs. There has a
lot of considerable progress made in the last 10 years. Since 1978,
the number of blacks and Hispanics has increased 30 percent. And
women constitute 40 percent of all airline employees.''
   The report said one problem appeared to be ``an old boy network,
wherein whites, white males in particular, are favored in hiring
and promotion decisions.'' It said another was that black employees
are often placed in jobs outside the mainstream and thus are among
the first to go when there are layoffs.
   It also acknowledged that flux within the industry caused by
mergers and deregulation have played a part. And it said some of
the problem is traceable to union seniority rules, competition with
other industries for skilled black workers and lack of equal
educational opportunities.
   The report recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration
take a more active role in monitoring the industry for affirmative
action compliance. It also called for an in-depth review of hiring
practices by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   Nine of the committee's 15 Republicans, however, said in
dissenting views attached to the report it was neither ``necessary
nor advisable that the FAA once again be given a role in overseeing
affirmative action within the commercial airline industry.''
   It said there were many reasons for the low percentages of
minority employees in top airline jobs and added that failure to
give those causes due weight while stressing affirmative action
problems ``potentially distorts rather than clarifies the airlines'
record.''
   ``In addition, and perhaps most importantly, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency charged with
enforcing our most important anti-discrimination laws, has found no
evidence nor indication that the airline industry's record on
affirmative action ... is unique or different from any other
industry,'' the nine said.

<HEAD>Shultz Willing To Meet With Iran on War, Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says he's
willing to meet with his Iranian counterpart to discuss an end to
the Iran-Iraq war, terrorism and hostage-taking but not the return
of Iranian assets.
   U.S. officials are trying to find ``an authoritative channel''
for direct talks with Iran, but he has not sought a meeting with
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati during the Iranian
official's visit to the United Nations for peace talks, Shultz said.
   ``We don't have to go running around after people,'' Shultz said
Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.'' But he added, ``It's
important to Iran to have a relationship with the United States and
that will emerge in due time.''
   Asked if he would meet with Velayati if such a meeting were
requested, Shultz replied, ``Sure,'' adding, ``I don't know that
it's necessarily the right way to start, to have the foreign
ministers meet, but at any rate we have stated our policy.''
   He indicated the United States continues to make contacts with
Iran through third countries and said U.S. officials have
repeatedly expressed a willingness to hold direct talks on ``what
it takes for them to become part of the civilized community.''
   He said if Iran will stop the war, stop being involved in
terrorism and stop promoting the taking of hostages, then ``there
is a prospect of more normal relations with us.''
   Shultz said the issue of releasing nine Americans held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon would have to be separate from
financial and other considerations.
   He noted that the issue of releasing Iranian assets held by the
United States is being handled by a claims tribunal court in The
Hague and ``there is no reason to disrupt it.'' Iranian officials
have suggested they might work for release of the hostages if the
assets are returned, but Reagan administration officials have said
they will make no such deal.

   Insisting Lt. Col. William Higgins used
his United Nations post as a cover to spy for the United States, a
pro-Iranian extremist group rejected a U.N. appeal for the American
hostage's release.
   Abbas Mousawi, a senior leader of the Shiite Moslem Hezbollah,
or Party of God, said Sunday that the group considers the U.N.
resolution ``part of a plot against the Moslems and Mujahedeen
(holy warriors) of this area.''
   ``We consider the arrest of this agent by the sons of this
nation as part of its defense of its dignity and existence,''
Mousawi said at a rally in the southeastern town of Mashgara.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for Shiite
factions holding most of the 18 foreign hostages, including nine
Americans, in Lebanon.
   Mousawi's speech was the first Hezbollah reply to resolution
passed unanimously Friday by the 15-nation Security Council
condemning the U.S. Marine's abduction and pleading for his
immediate release.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was chief of a 76-member observer
group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon when he was
abducted Feb. 17. The Vietnam veteran also served as an aide to
former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   Hezbollah has publicly defended the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, which claimed responsibility for Higgins'
abduction.
   ``Everyone knows that when Higgins was seized by the oppressed
in south Lebanon he wasn't on a humanitarian mission, but,
according to even the American press and President Reagan, he was
engaged in a spying mission on Hezbollah in south Lebanon,'' said
Mousawi.
   There is no record of Reagan making such a statement.
   ``So it is within our right to say that the presence of Higgins
under the Security Council umbrella in south Lebanon is part of a
war waged by this arrogant body and America, the great Satan,
against our oppressed people,'' Mousawi said.
   His oration drew thunderous chants of ``Death to the Great
Satan!'' and ``No to the Security Council!'' from thousands of
fist-shaking Shiite Moslem zealots attending the rally.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth has repeatedly
charged that Higgins was a spy for the CIA, but U.S. and U.N.
officials deny it.
   Also Sunday, a Church of England bishop said he visited Lebanon
last week to inquire into the fate of four missing Iranians in
hopes his efforts might hasten the release of Western hostages, who
include Anglican envoy Terry Waite.
   Christian militiamen kidnapped the Iranians in July 1982. There
have been reports that they were killed, and Iran has been seeking
word on them.
   After arriving in Britain on Sunday, The Rev. John Brown told
reporters he hoped his mission to Lebanon had ``made a contribution
towards the overall picture, which I hope will lead towards the
release of all the hostages.''
   Brown, Anglican bishop in Cyprus and the Persian Gulf region,
went at the request of his church's head, Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie.
   He said he spoke in Lebanon to leaders of the Maronite Church
and the Armenian church, who ``promised to make inquiries.
   ``It's very important to us when we are talking to the Iranians
... to show them that we are concerned about their missing people
as well as ours,'' Brown told reporters.
   Runcie aide John Lyttle said Brown was ``well guarded'' during
his visit and did not venture out of the Christian part of Lebanon.
   Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the release of
American hostages in Lebanon. The longest-held hostage is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   A leak developed Sunday in
Discovery's fuel lines, halting the loading of fuel and raising the
possibility of another postponement of a test firing of the space
shuttle's engines, NASA said.
   The leak occurred as crews were filling the external fuel tanks
with liquid hydrogen and oxygen, said NASA spokeswoman Cindy Buck.
   ``We're trouble-shooting the liquid hydrogen leak and looking to
see if we will be able to continue filling the tank to completion
right now,'' she said early Monday.
   Earlier Sunday, a two-part countdown resumed for the test-firing
of Discovery's engines after engineers repaired a hydrogen leak and
a balky oxygen pump.
   The problems that cropped up Friday had caused the fourth
postponement in 10 days for the test, which is considered critical
to certifying Discovery for the first shuttle flight since the
Challenger disaster.
   The leak and pump were repaired Saturday, and the test-firing is
now scheduled to take place Thursday.
   Officials believe the delays, combined with an unresolved leak
in Discovery's steering engine system, will slip the launch date
from mid-September into October.
   The leak and pump problems developed Friday soon after
technicians began pouring more than half a million gallons of
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the spaceship's
external fuel tank on Launch Pad 39B.
   It was the first attempt to fuel a space shuttle since
Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew of seven.
   The exercise leading to the firing of the three main engines,
with Discovery bolted firmly on the launch pad, is divided into two
parts.
   The first part involved fully fueling the tank and simulating a
problem that forces a postponement with the countdown at 10 seconds
before a mock liftoff. That was to take place Monday.
   The launch team then was to empty the tank, restart the
countdown, refill the tank and aim for a 20-second ignition of the
engines at 7:30 a.m. Thursday.
   The purpose of the overall test is to check several
modifications made to the engines and launch pad since the
Challenger accident and to provide countdown practice for the
launch team.
   When the test is completed, NASA still must cope with the small
gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from the main
engines.
   Engineers have come up with a plan to reach and repair the leak
by entering Discovery's cargo bay and cutting a hole through the
rear bulkhead into the steering engine compartment.
   Another option, with a decision to be made after the
test-firing, is to take Discovery off the launch pad and back to a
hangar for repair, a move that could postpone the launch until
November.

   Conservative New York Rep. Jack Kemp says
he refuses to dwell on whether George Bush asked him to be his
Republican Party vice presidential running mate.
   ``It's not your decision or my decision, it's George Bush's. I'm
not thinking about it until I'm asked,'' Kemp said when he arrived
at Esler Regional Airport over the weekend. ``My mother told me ...
not to worry about things over which you have no control.''
   Kemp was in the central Louisiana city of Alexandria to attend a
Republican fund-raiser and strategy meetings.
   Bush, the certain GOP presidential candidate, has said he will
keep his choice for vice president a secret until the Republican

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ Michael Dukakis will address a convention of
the United Steelworkers of America, either in person or by

court labor without wearing the union label.
   The convention begins today, and Dukakis is scheduled to speak
Thursday. Although the union will express its preference, it will
not formally endorse a candidate, said Gary Hubbard, an aide to USW
President Lynn Williams.
   ``There's no question about the support'' among steelworkers for

political analysts inside and outside the USW say Dukakis is less

   The National Urban League is declining to endorse

made it clear the Republican Party has little chance of support
from black voters.
   Organization President John E. Jacob on Sunday lashed out at the
Republican Party, saying he questioned its claims of trying to woo
black voters in this year's presidential election.
   Jacob said at a news conference opening the group's four-day

Ronald Reagan didn't come in 1984.''
   On Saturday, Bush spokesman Mark Goodin said a scheduling

   Vice President George Bush says Michael
Dukakis' use of an old Greek saying about rotten fish to condemn
the Reagan administration's record on ethics was ``very tasteless
and offensive.''
   ``I'll tell you, what bothered me a little bit about what he

said. ``And I think the American people will reject that kind of

   ``You don't make tasteless, offensive analogies to the president

   Dukakis, appearing in Louisville, Ky., on Saturday, used the
saying when asked whether President Reagan or the vice president
should be blamed personally for the alleged misdeeds of Pentagon
contractors, consultants and administrators.
   ``There's an old Greek saying, and I suspect the Italians have
the same one: `You know, the fish rots from the head first.' It

<TEXT>
   A congressional committee is charging that
millions of substandard bolts and nuts are being used in everything
from military equipment and weapons to the space shuttle and
commercial trucks.
   ``The millions and perhaps billions of substandard fasteners
used by our military and sensitive industries make it a wonder that
we haven't had a major catastrophe,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and
its investigations subcommittee.
   The panel issued its report this weekend after a two-year
investigation that uncovered millions of substandard bolts, nuts,
and screws _ many of them imported from Japan.
   Dingell said the problem could have wide-ranging effects and,
along with 50 other House members, has introduced legislation to
try to correct the problem. The bill would require laboratory
testing and greater documentation of fasteners to make it more
difficult to substitute cheaper and less effective parts.

<HEAD>Death Sentences, Executions Highest Since Court Restored Penalty</HEAD>

   The government counted nearly 2,000 prisoners
on death row last year and 25 of them were put to death, both
record highs since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment
in 1976.
   The 25 prisoners executed last year in eight states had spent an
average of seven years and two months waiting for the sentence to
be carried out, the Bureau of Justice Statistics said on Sunday.
   State courts sentenced nearly 300 people to death in 1987, while
the death sentences of 79 were vacated or commuted, the report
said. A total of 1,984 men and women were on death row in 34 states
as of Dec. 31.
   More than 60 percent of the death row prisoners were held in
states in the South, 18 percent in the West, 15 percent in the
Midwest and 5 percent in the Northeast. The study said more than 57
percent of the death row inmates were white and 41 percent were

<HEAD>West Germany Topped U.S. Exports Again in 1987</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West Germany was the world's largest exporter
last year for the second year in a row and is continuing to
outdistance the United States this year, according to the
International Monetary Fund.
   West German exports amounted to $294 billion, compared with $250
billion for the United States and $231 billion for Japan in 1987,
the IMF said.
   West German exports, which first jumped ahead of U.S. exports in
1986, also ran ahead of U.S. exports for the first two months of
1988: $46.7 billion for West Germany compared with $45.9 billion
for the United States.
   The IMF figures, in an IMF publication released Friday, show
total trade increased 10 percent in 1986 and 18 percent in 1987.
   The fund reported that trade among the biggest countries
remained far out of balance in 1986 and 1987. The United States
imported much more than it exported, while the reverse was true for
Japan and West Germany.
   U.S. imports in 1987 were $424 billion, compared with $228
billion for West Germany, $158 billion for France, $154 billion for
Britain and $151 billion for Japan.

<HEAD>Producers: `We've Hit the Brick Wall'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks to end the 22-week scriptwriters strike
have ``hit a brick wall,'' according to the producers' top
negotiator who is urging strikers to cross picket lines and end the
industry's second-longest walkout.
   ``We will get our production on schedule any way we can,''
Nicholas Counter III, president the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers, said at a news conference Sunday. ``What
individual writers choose to do is up to them.''
   A union spokeswoman predicted that strikers would remain
steadfast.
   ``To encourage writers to come back to work is an unfortunate
retrenchment at a time when both sides should resume negotiation
and settle this dispute,'' said spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   The negotiations deadlocked Saturday after an 11-hour session.
   ``We've simply gotten to the end of the road, and we've hit a
brick wall,'' Counter said of the 217-member alliance. ``We will
redouble our efforts to produce as many programs as possible.''
   The major unresolved issue is how much the writers should get
from sale of TV shows and movies abroad and from domestic TV reruns.
   The strike, which began March 7, has left the fall television
season in chaos and has led to financial hardship for many of the
Writers Guild of America's 9,000 members, as well as
entertainment-related industries.
   Counter said production companies belonging to the alliance
would welcome strike-breaking union members and likely would offer
financial protection against any union reprisal. Guild officials
have said writers who go back to work risk fines of up to 110
percent of their compensation from the producers and expulsion from
the union.
   About 50 guild members, meanwhile, singled out Walt Disney
Studios on Sunday by picketing movie theaters in Hollywood and
Westwood showing the hit Disney film ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
   The demonstrators blamed Disney for blocking a tentative
settlement with the alliance, and held signs and passed out fliers
saying ``Who framed the writers guild?'' and ``Mickey Mouse is
stealing from our kids.''
   Rhoden called the demonstrations ``public outrage pickets,'' and
said more would be planned this week here and in other parts of the
country.
   She called prospects of a fall TV season ``doubtful and
improbable. They may put a few shows on the air, but it will not be
a full schedule.''
   The strike is only a week short of the entertainment's
industry's longest _ a 23-week walkout by the guild in 1960. That
strike won writers payments for television reruns.
   Also Sunday, Counter and Earl Bush, chairman of the basic crafts
unions, issued a joint statement Sunday saying the alliance and
behind-the-scenes workers agreed to extend their contracts on a
day-to-day basis. Those contracts were to have expired at midnight.
   ``The parties will resume discussions on Wednesday ... with the
expectation of negotiating to conclusion,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Heading Off Foreign Policy Squabbles: Experts Tell How</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new president should move quickly to fill
foreign policy posts and make clear immediately that his secretary
of state is his ``one principal lieutenant'' in foreign affairs, a
report on presidential transition recommends.
   The report noted that Presidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan ``all
found their administrations involved early in internal disputes
between the national security adviser and the State Department.''
   The report never mentioned the Iran-Contra affair, which came to
light in President Reagan's second term. But it said ``recent
events'' have demonstrated the need for a new president to tell his
national security adviser ``at the start precisely what role and
responsibilities'' he and his staff should assume, ``including
their relations with the secretary of state.
   ``Coherence and consistency in foreign policy are best served if
the president has only one principal lieutenant in that area, the
secretary of state.''
   The report, entitled ``Transferring Responsibility: The Dangers
of Transition,'' was released by the White Burkett Miller Center of
Public Affairs at the University of Virginia.
   The study was the work of a Commission On Presidential
Transitions and Foreign Policy headed by former secretaries of
state Cyrus R. Vance and William P. Rogers.
   The commission included members of every post-war presidential
transition, from the Franklin D. Roosevelt-Harry Truman changeover
to that of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.
   The Rogers-Vance commission recommended:
   _Key foreign policy officials should be selected promptly by a
new administration, with Cabinet officers chosen within four weeks
of the election and sub-Cabinet positions filled within 10 weeks.
   The process often takes longer, the report said, because of
political considerations in the White House and the Senate.
   _Key presidential foreign policy documents should be reproduced
for the incoming president. ``We know of no large institution other
than the White House in which, when a change of leadership occurs,
many of the files relevant to continuing policy decisions are
packed up and taken away by the departing top official,'' the
report said.
   _The Office of Management and Budget should be restored as the
``institutional memory'' of the president's office and the number
of political appointees at the top of OMB should be reduced.
   _Pre-inaugural meetings between representatives of the incoming
administration and foreign diplomats and leaders should be sharply
limited.
   _Each presidential candidate should begin building a pool of
potential foreign policy appointees immediately after the political
party conventions, and use small task forces rather than large
transition teams.
   The report said that during a presidential campaign, candidates
should be careful ``in the number and scope of promises they make
in the foreign policy field. Some political promises which bring
success in the election may produce failure in office.''
   Once in office, a new president should be careful not to
``politicize the career services,'' the report said.
   New administrations are often ``distrustful of bureaucrats'' and
only slowly do they learn how heavily they can rely on the
professionalism of foreign service officers and members of the
other career services,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   A pack of runners darted through the
woods, bushwhacked up and down thicket-choked slopes, dashed along
railroad tracks and abandoned roads, forded knee-deep streams and
slogged through thigh-high mud.
   They closed out the day with beer, a barbecue and good
fellowship.
   Born in the rubber plantations and jungles of east Asia in an
era when the sun never set on the British empire, the sport known
as hashing has made its way halfway around the world to Maine,
where one devotee is writing a book about it.
   Hashing, a non-competitive form of cross-country running that
traces its roots to the game of hare and hounds, is enjoyed by
roughly 50,000 participants in more than 700 clubs in 124 countries
from Andorra to Zimbabwe.
   ``It's a way to get a little exercise and a little
sociability,'' said freelance writer Alice Johnson of Hallowell,
founder of the Hallowell Hash House Harriers, one of about 80 clubs
in the United States.
   California leads with 16.
   For her research on her forthcoming book, Johnson was recently
in Bali, site of the 1988 Interhash, known as the biennial Olympics
of hashing, and in Malaysia for the the 50th anniversary
celebration of the founding of the original Hash House Harriers,
known affectionately as ``the mother hash.''
   The group was founded at a Kuala Lumpur club by British soldiers
and expatriate businessmen who ran through the jungle to work up a
thirst. It selected the name from the institutional quality of the
club's food.
   At a midsummer hash that began at her lakefront cottage here,
Johnson briefed newcomers on the rules. Runners designated as hares
set the course in advance, marking it with flour; they are the only
ones who know where it will lead.
   At various points, hares draw circles indicating checkpoints
from which several possible routes fan out in different directions.
All but one are false trails that end with a marker telling the
runner to return to the checkpoint and try again.
   The runner who finally discovers the right trail shouts ``I'm
on!'' or ``On-on!'' The hares who follow the pack to keep track of
stragglers sound a horn, and all run toward the next checkpoint to
restart the process.
   The search for the correct trail provides time for slower
runners to catch up with those up front.
   ``It takes away a lot of the ego trip involved with track and
other competitive racing,'' said Noel Mount, an Irish-born former
rugby player who was one of the two dozen Hallowell hashers to run
the nearly six-mile course.
   ``You get ahead, but then you take the wrong trail and that
brings you back with everyone else.''
   Johnson's husband, Wick, along with summer neighbors Oliver
Greeves and Andrew Engelman, reconnoitered the area the previous
evening and spent three hours that morning laying out the route and
marking it with 10 pounds of flour. In the tropics, hares use paper
rather than flour to leave their marks.
   Greeves, a resident of Hong Kong, introduced the Johnsons to
hashing two years ago. While on a visit to Hong Kong, Wick Johnson
was invited by Greeves to participate in an all-male hash. He
returned exhausted but enthusiastic, telling his wife, a
recreational runner, that this was a sport she would love.
   Upon her return home that summer, Alice Johnson rounded up a
group of friends and neighbors from Hallowell, just outside
Augusta, and organized the area's first hash.
   ``The trick is getting the right people at the beginning. It has
to be people who don't take themselves too seriously,'' she said.
``Most are runners, but it is definitely not a requirement. You
just have to be fit enough to run approximately six miles _ with
stops.''

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says his
visit to Latin America this week is not intended to force leaders
there into a confrontation with Nicaragua over democratic reforms.
   Shultz's 10-day journey to nine countries begins today in
Guatemala, where he will meet with the foreign ministers of four
Central American countries in an attempt to come up with a common
strategy on the leftist Sandinista government.
   Shultz on Sunday said a statement which he said was drafted
mostly by the foreign ministers of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa
Rica and Honduras is still open to discussion.
   ``We're not trying to ram anything down anyone's throat,'' he
said on the CBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.'' ``Having drafted
it, they are not so sure they want to issue it.''
   Honduras, meanwhile, harshly criticized Guatemala and Costa Rica
for insisting that the joint communique on Nicaragua to be issued
following today's meeting be softened, calling their action
``incomprehensible and strange.''
   The Hondurans, in a statement issued to reporters Sunday night,
said the Guatemalans and Costa Ricans had made a number of changes
in the document that was first agreed to a month ago, including
many provisions aimed at Nicaragua.
   A senior Reagan administration official who briefed reporters on
Friday said it was unclear whether the Guatemala meeting will
result in a joint statement of principles designed to prod
Nicaragua into complying with its stated commitment to move toward
democratic reforms.
   The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said a
consensus on a common policy toward Nicaragua has been difficult to
reach.
   The special U.S. envoy to Central America, Morris Busby, has
been consulting on that issue with officials from the four Central
American nations.
   In Managua, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega urged the four
Central American countries to reject any U.S. attempt to condemn or
isolate Nicaragua.
   Ortega told reporters Sunday he hoped ``the Central American
governments will respond with dignity and firmness and reject the
proposal of the United States.''
   He said the United States is ``trying to escalate the war ...
with consequences for all the Central American countries, not just
for Nicaragua.''
   A Guatemalan legislator, meanwhile, accused the State Department
of trying to pressure the countries into signing a virtual
``declaration of war'' against Nicaragua.
   The legislator, Edmund Mulet Lesiur, representing a political
party known as the Union of the National Center, said President
Vinicio Cerezo rejected a demand by Busby to abandon Guatemala's
policy of ``active neutrality'' by agreeing to the document.
   Mulet said Honduras and El Salvador had agreed to sign it, while
Guatemala and Costa Rica turned it down.
   The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City issued a statement Sunday
categorically denying Mulet's statements, made in an interview with
a Guatemala City newspaper.
   ``The United States has not `pressured' Guatemala or any other
country. The United States has not asked Guatemala to abandon
`active neutrality,''' the embassy said.
   A fragile cease-fire remains in place in Nicaragua, but there
has been no progress on a final settlement between the Sandinistas
and the Contra rebels. The impasse has produced calls by
conservative members of Congress for a renewal of military aid to
the rebels,
   In public statements this past week, rebel leaders have
maintained the truce has helped the Sandinistas by enabling them to
strengthen their overall military position while the Contras have
been denied lethal aid from the United States.
   The administration has contended the Sandinistas also have
stepped up internal repression since the truce went into effect
four months ago.
   In a commentary this past week in The New York Times, Assistant
Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said the situation in Nicaragua
deteriorated after Congress rejected a Contra military aid request

   Much of Shultz's trip will be devoted to highlighting the
democratic trend in the hemisphere. All of the nations on his
itinerary have elected governments and all, with the exception of
Costa Rica, became democratic over the past nine years.
   After Guatemala, Shultz will travel to Argentina, Uruguay,
Brazil and Bolivia before a return trip, lasting 24 hours, to
Central America on Aug. 8 for talks in Costa Rica, El Salvador and
Honduras.
   The trip ends on Aug. 10 when Shultz will attend the inaugural
ceremony of Ecuadoran President-elect Rodrigo Borja. While in
Quito, Shultz also will confer with President Jaime Lucinchi of
Venezuela and President Virgilio Barco of Colombia.

<HEAD>Explosion Causes Army Barracks To Collapse</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Scotland Yard saying at least one dead, suspect
device found in car, firefighters withdrawn from area. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   An explosion caused a two-story army barracks in
north London to collapse early Monday, killing at least one person
and injuring at least seven, Scotland Yard said.
   Part of the Inglis barracks, which houses members of the Women's
Royal Army Corps., caught fire, London Fire Brigade officials said.
   Press Association said an army disposal unit was inspecting a
``suspect device'' found in a car in a parking lot adjacent to the
barracks in the Mill Hill neighborhood.
   It said firefighters were withdrawn from the area.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.
   London Broadcasting Corp. radio had reported that two people
died and 20 were trapped at the Inglis barracks in the Mill Hill
neighborhood.
   Press Association, the domestic British news agency, reported
one dead and eight injured in the explosion, which occurred about 7
a.m. (2 a.m. EDT).
   The Ministry of Defense said the barracks also is used as an
army postal and courier depot.
   London Ambulance said the injured were taken to two hospitals.
   ``One of the injured is in a critical state with back and leg
injuries,'' said an ambulance spokesman, speaking anonymously in
keeping with British custom.
   The barracks are located in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
parliamentary constituency.

<HEAD>Gulf Still Has `Couple of Hundred' Mines, Officers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD USS CONQUEST IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This old U.S.
Navy mine sweeper and five others like it may remain in the Persian
Gulf until an estimated ``couple of hundred'' mines still lurking
in the waters are found and destroyed, U.S. officers say.
   While a cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war would probably keep new
mines from being laid, those already deployed could pose a danger
to shipping for years to come unless cleaned up.
   The task falls to ships like the creaky, 800-ton Conquest, whose
crew works these days in 130-degree deck temperatures, using a
submersible robot to locate mines and trailing gear to cut the
cables that moor them to the seabed.
   When a submerged mine shows up on the sonar screen, divers are
guided to the spot and attach explosives, which are detonated by
time fuse or remote control.
   Capt. Jim Miller, ``commodore'' of the U.S. mine-sweeping force,
would not predict how long the tedious and dangerous job of
clearing the gulf of mines might require.
   ``We're not going to do it in a week or two weeks,'' he said in
an interview. ``It's going to take a lot longer than that.''
   Miller said this could mean some or all of the six U.S. mine
sweepers in the gulf might be excluded from a force cutback
promised by U.S. officials when and if Tehran and Baghdad formally
agree to a truce in their 8-year-old war.
   Iran, which is blamed for laying most of the mines in the gulf,
announced July 18 that it would join Iraq in accepting a year-old
U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   The wooden-hulled U.S. mine sweepers, all built in the early
1950s but updated for gulf duty with modern sonar, navigation and
mine-hunting gear, comprise about a third of the U.S. naval force
now in the gulf.
   Their ``mothership'' is the amphibious landing ship Dubuque,
which also carries about 400 Marines and eight helicopters.
   U.S. military sources in Washington say the six aging mine
sweepers might possibly be given to a gulf Arab state rather than
returned to the United States. The navy has 15 other mine sweepers
of similar vintage, and is building 31 new, state-of-the-art ships
for hunting mines.
   Miller said he had ``no firsthand knowledge'' of such a plan,
but noted that scores of former U.S. warships are now sailing with
other navies.
   He conceded it could take years before the gulf is free of
mines, if ever. Mines laid in the North Sea during World War II
were still being recovered as recently as 1980, he said.
   The mine threat had a major role in prompting the naval buildup
by the United States and five European navies in the gulf a year
ago.
   In addition to the six U.S. craft, which arrived in November,
Britain, France, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands sent anti-mine
forces. The Soviet Union also has ships capable of mine-sweeping in
the waterway.
   European forces were later cut back, and two remaining Belgian
and Dutch mine-hunters combined with three British ships under
Royal Navy command.
   U.S. Navy records indicate at least 10 vessels have hit mines in
the gulf since the Soviet tanker Marshal Chuikov was damaged off
Kuwait on May 16, 1987.
   Among later victims were the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti supertanker
Bridgeton, the American frigate Samuel B. Roberts, an offshore
supply vessel sunk with six killed and an ocean survey ship with
four lost.
   After the Samuel B. Roberts narrowly escaped destruction in the
central gulf on April 14, U.S. searchers found three more mines in
those waters.
   Officers said all were clean of marine growth, indicating they
were newly laid, and one bore the letters ``USA'' in white paint.
   The mines, of a 1908 Russian type, were identical with those
found aboard the captured Iranian minelayer Iran Ajr in September,
they said.
   Overall, some 80 mines have been found in the past year,
according to available records.
   Miller said ``everybody has found some.'' The U.S. Navy found
52, the latest in May. The British and French each have found more
than a dozen.
   Miller said the estimated ``couple of hundred'' mines still in
the gulf are concentrated in certain areas, including waters just
south of Iraq and an area of the northern gulf near Iranian-held
Farsi island.
   The mines off Iraq, believed laid by both sides, are a special
threat because they break lose in rough weather and drift to the
Arab side of the gulf. Several vessels have struck these renegade
``floaters'' off Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.

<HEAD>Seizing Abandoned Buildings, Homeless Advocates Change Focus And
Tactics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen advocates for the homeless are arrested
after seizing a vacant Seattle hotel. Activists take over two
abandoned public housing units in Chicago. During a day of
nationwide protests, 18 people are arrested in Boston as they try
to commandeer a boarded-up building.
   New, more aggressive tactics to get housing for America's
homeless have led to repeated assaults on vacant buildings for
takeover and restoration.
   ``Abandoned buildings are a very powerful symbol,'' said
activist Mitch Snyder. ``There's no reason for them to lie fallow
while millions of people are homeless, except for lack of funding.''
   Snyder and his Washington-based Community for Creative
Non-Violence have organized sit-ins and monthlong hunger strikes in
their push for shelters and housing for the homeless.
   ``Creating shelters is no alternative to affordable housing,''
Snyder said. ``I went to 48 cities in two weeks last month meeting
with people and encouraging them to plan occupations of buildings.''
   Said Robert Hayes, a former Wall Street lawyer and founder of
the National Coalition for the Homeless, ``Tactics that don't make
explicit that the solution to homelessness is housing don't make
sense.''
   Hayes said most important is legislation to provide affordable
housing, but building occupations highlight the importance of
legislation.
   ``That kind of work is only strengthened by voices coming from
the streets,'' he said.
   More than 100 activists were arrested during protests in about
50 cities July 14, a day of coordinated building occupations to
promote affordable housing legislation introduced in Congress.
   In Boston, Homeless Action Day protests turned to violence when
about 80 activists used crow bars to tear boards from doors and
windows of an abandoned building.
   Eighteen protesters were charged with breaking and entering and
assaulting a police officer. One woman was injured when she was
struck by a mounted officer's horse as it galloped through the
crowd.
   ``I consider myself one of the lucky 18 to be able to make a
statement about the plight of the homeless,'' said Jim Stewart of
the Cambridge Committee on Human Shelter Emergency, who was
arrested in the fracas.
   Stewart said advocates are willing to risk arrest and injury
because sit-ins and marches have not been effective.
   In Northampton, activists commandeered a vacant house on the
grounds of a state mental hospital July 14. Hospital officials
watched as the activists began converting the building into a
shelter, but had them arrested three days later for trespassing.
   ``We called it a work-in,'' said George Markham, a spokesman for
the group.
   Markham said their aim was to place ``constructive,
non-violent'' pressure on state officials to turn vacant public
buildings into housing.
   While more than 100 people were arrested nationwide during the
July 14 action, Tim Hager of the National Coalition for the
Homeless said occupations in some cities led to new housing.
   The mayors of Cincinnati and New Orleans allowed protesters to
keep the abandoned buildings they had begun renovating, he said.
   Activity has not been limited to July 14. The Chicago and
Seattle incidents occurred in early January, as did the arrest of
17 activists in Oakland, Calif., who occupied three vacant
Victorian homes the city hopes to restore.
   On March 16, one woman was arrested and several protesters
fought with police as 35 squatters were evicted from a Berkeley,
Calif., house owned by the University of California.
   Other actions included a three-month sit-in by homeless people
on the steps of Boston City Hall. The group ended its protest July
21 when city officials promised an office and a crisis hotline for
the homeless.
   In November 1987, Massachusetts Institute of Technology police
evicted 15 homeless people who set up a tent city on university
property for about a month hoping for an offer of housing.
   Homeless Action Day was planned to call attention to a bill
introduced by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., two days earlier. Frank's
bill would provide $15 billion a year for the next five years to
build 7.5 million affordable housing units.
   Frank denounced the protests, saying they would not help his
legislation. ``It was all very stupid, very unfair,'' he said.
``The bill's been out for only two days.''
   ``There's so much to be done,'' Hayes said, ``that almost every
tactic has to be employed.''

<HEAD>China Reportedly Refusing to Allow Pol Pot Leave The Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities in Bejing are refusing to allow
former Cambodia ruler Pol Pot to leave China, where the leader of
the murderous Khmer Rouge regime is hospitalized for unspecified
treatment, a magazine reported.
   The August edition of the Chinese-language Cheng Ming magazine,
seen today, also said China will offer political asylum to Pol Pot.
   While Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975-78,
hundreds of thousands of people died in vast slave-labor camps and
execution chambers as the government attempted to turn the country
into a primitive agrarian society.
   Vietnamese forces drove the Khmer Rouge into the mountain
jungles of western Cambodia and installed the current Phnom Penh
government in early 1979.
   Pol Pot has not been seen by outsiders in recent years and has
been reported to suffer from various ailments that sent him for
treatment to Bangkok, Thailand, and Beijing.
   Cheng Ming, in a brief report about Pol Pot, said he was being
treated at an unidentified Beijing hospital.
   The China-watching magazine said China had reached a tacit
agreement with the United States to stop supplying military aid to
Pol Pot and not to allow him to return to power in Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest member in a coalition of three
guerrilla groups opposed to Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.
   Coalition leaders and the prime minister of the
Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh government met last week in Indonesia
at unprecedented peace talks.
   The possible role of the Khmer Rouge in any future government
was a major stumbling block.
   Vietnam says it plans to withdraw its troops from Cambodia by
1991.
   Pol Pot officially retired in September 1985 as commander in
chief of the Khmer Rouge army and was named director of the party's
Institute for National Defense. The move was widely seen as an
attempt by the Khmer Rouge to clean up its international image.

   After being plagued for years by the
annoying buzz of the lusty humming toadfish, hundreds of houseboat
residents here decided to turn the other gill, er, cheek.
   The humming toadfish season usually marks a time when sleepy
houseboat dwellers put pillows over their heads to escape the
irritating nighttime sound of thousands of sex-starved male fish.
   But this year, houseboaters threw the Sausalito Humming Toadfish
Festival instead.
   ``They're just out looking for a mate, just like everybody else
in Sausalito,'' said John McCosker, the Steinhart Aquarium
ichthyologist and oceanographer who identified the humming toadfish
as the cause of the mysterious buzz in 1985.
   In its courtship ritual, the fish sidles up to a concrete
structure _ a cave or houseboat will do _ and blows air through its
bladder. The noise apparently drives female toadfish crazy with
desire. The hum usually begins in June and stops when the mating
season ends in August.
   About 5,000 people turned out for Sunday's fish festival in
which McCosker was crowned king of the festivities.
   ``It was overwhelming,'' McCosker said. ``Who would have thought
as an ichthyologist I would have risen to such heights, or, in
Sausalito, such depths.''

   America's palate apparently is honed to where
the buffalo roam, says Duane Helland, who specializes in bison
cuisine.
   Helland, who owns and operates Helland's Food and Locker Service
with his wife, Sue, decided to expand his menu to include the great
American bison in reaction to ``a changing society,'' he said.
   ``People want to eat meat that's low in calories, fat and
cholesterol and high in protein,'' said Helland, who has filled
orders for almost 5,000 pounds of buffalo meat.
   The average serving of beef contains 24 percent protein and 28
percent fat. Buffalo has 35 percent protein and 3 percent fat,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   There is about half the amount of cholesterol in a buffalo roast
than in a similar cut of beef, said Mary Duvall, executive director
of the National Buffalo Association, in Fort Pierre, S.D.
   ``If it's not overcooked, it's a little sweeter than beef.
There's no wild flavor,'' Helland said. ``It's real smooth. Texture
of the meat is very silky.''
   There's a catch, though. ``It's twice the price of beef,''
Helland said.
   In 1850, about 20 million buffalo thundered on the western
plains. In the late 1800s, hunters slaughtered millions of bison
until their numbers dwindled. By 1889, only 551 bison were found
alive in the United States.
   Today, as many as 100,000 exist, mostly in the hands of private
individuals, Duvall said.

<TEXT>
   As the nation's top Mafia investigator, Giovanni
Falcone symbolized a new generation of brave, activist judges
dedicated to ending the reign of organized crime in Sicily.
   Now, he and eight fellow investigating magistrates have
resigned, spurring questions about the depth of the government's
commitment to fighting the Mafia. All nine had played a prominent
role in Italy's largest Mafia trial.
   In stepping down with the others on Saturday, Falcone said he
wanted to be able to freely testify before a judicial panel looking
into the government's anti-Mafia effort. He also suggested there
was something profoundly wrong with the war on organized crime.
   Following reports that members of Italy's dominant political
party had in an unrelated case arranged payment of a ransom to
underworld figures, the resignations shocked Italians and prompted
criticism of the government.
   ``The judges and all the others that have risked their lives
fighting the Mafia have felt increasingly abandoned by the state,''
the newspaper Corriere della Sera said in a front-page editorial on
Sunday.
   Falcone, 48, and the other eight resigning investigators had
together comprised a special ``anti-Mafia pool,'' which was formed
after the 1983 assassination of the chief investigating magistrate
in Palermo, Sicily's capital.
   The team, led by Falcone, pushed Italian law to its limit,
examining bank records of alleged Mafiosi and ordering sweeping
arrests.
   It was the dapper, mustachioed Falcone who persuaded mob figure
Tommaso Buscetta to detail the structure of the Mafia and how it
shipped heroin from Sicily to the United States, a breakthrough
that led to the nation's huge organized crime trial.
   The so-called maxi-trial ended in December with convictions of
338 Mafiosi, including 19 reputed members of the Cosa Nostra's
leadership commission.
   Since the trial, however, the anti-Mafia pool has been stymied
by its new director, chaos in the police force and government
indifference, according to prominent Sicilian prosecutor Paolo
Borsellino.
   Borsellino's declarations to journalists two weeks ago prompted
President Francesco Cossiga to order investigations by the
ministries of Justice and Interior and the Superior Council of
Magistrates, which oversees judges.
   As the judges' body began hearings in Rome on Saturday, Falcone
and his colleagues submitted their resignations and asked for
transfers.
   ``That which I had feared could happen unfortunately happened,''
Falcone wrote. ``The investigations into the Mafia have been
obstructed and (the anti-Mafia pool) ... is now stalled.''
   Another investigator who resigned, Giuseppe Di Lello, charged:
``The inattention of the government is palpable in the
disorganization of the investigating offices.''
   Falcone did not elaborate on how or why the investigations may
have slowed. But he said his views on prosecuting the Mafia
``diverge radically'' from those of the chief investigating
magistrate, Antonino Meli.
   Meli was appointed in February over the objections of Falcone
and others, who said he had no experience in Mafia probes.
   Borsellino, a former member of the anti-Mafia pool, told
reporters that Meli had removed Falcone as chief of major
anti-Mafia cases.
   Meli also divided the anti-Mafia work load among all
investigators, regardless of whether they were specialists,
Borsellino said, reverting to the system followed before the pool
was created.
   ``There have been serious attempts by the office of
investigations and the prosecutor of the republic of Palermo to
definitively dismantle the anti-Mafia pool,'' he said.
   Meli responded: ``The pool has not been destroyed, as Borsellino
says, and if anything it has been enlarged with the addition of
other judges.''
   Saturday's resignations prompted expressions of concern from
Italian politicians about the state of the war on the Mafia.
   ``There is a problem of management and administration of men; of
the types of judges; and it is more than a guess to think that the
difficulties have been exacerbated by the inopportune handling of
this government,'' said Virginio Rognoni of the dominant Christian
Democratic party who heads the justice commission in the Chamber of
Deputies.
   Last Thursday, an investigating judge released a report saying
some Christian Democrats helped gain the release of a kidnapped
colleague in 1981 by arranging ransoms for the Neopolitan Mafia and
Red Brigade leftist terrorists.
   Among those who may have been involved was Antonio Gava, the
current interior minister, the report said. Gava denied the charge.
   ``Today, we expected the resignation of Interior Minister
Antonio Gava,'' the Communist newspaper L'Unita said in a
front-page editorial Sunday headlined ``Honest Men and an Arrogant
Government.''
   ``Gava stays and Falcone leaves; it is not a good day for
Italy.''

   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union reached a
new eight-year-high in July with a total of 1,639 allowed to leave
the country, the agency involved in their resettlement said today.
   The total represented the seventh straight monthly rise in the
number of arrivals at the Vienna, Austria, transit center, the
Geneva-based Intergovermental Committee for Migration said. Only
930 people opted for new homes in Israel, well below the recent
average, the committee said.
   Last month's figure compared with 1,767 who left the Soviet
Union in June 1980, and brought to 7,656 the number of Jews
emigrating in the first seven months of the year, the committee
said.
   The largest official exodus _ 51,330 _ was recorded in 1979
before the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West
relations.
   Nearly 270,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement
program began in 1971.

   In an attempt to catch more viewers' eyes,
CBS has put color, movement and depth in its own eye after nearly
four decades.
   The new eye logo, which made its debut during Sunday's ``60
Minutes'' broadcast, is blue and three-dimensional. Computer
animation moves it's upper and lower crescents, and the logo is
accompanied by a seven-note theme.
   It still looks like the original, full-screen, black and white
eye, which had been the network's symbol since the early 1950s.
   ``The eye is sacrosanct,'' Jerry Goldberg, West Coast vice
president of advertising and promotion for the CBS Broadcast Group,
said during the planning stages.
   ``We don't tamper with the shape of the eye. This has in its
feeling and its final resolve a classic dignity. But that doesn't
mean stodgy.''
   In the 1987-88 season ratings, CBS finished last behind NBC and
ABC for the first time. The network has begun an aggressive
advertising campaign in the hopes of boosting fall ratings using
the theme of TV ``you can feel.''

<HEAD>More Murder And Assault Cases; 1,200 Officers Fired After
Corruption Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violent crime in the Soviet capital is down
overall but murders, assaults and juvenile crime are on the rise
and authorities probing police corruption have fired about 1,200
people, an official said.
   ``We don't hide that fact that in our ranks, there are
bribe-takers, money-grubbers, common criminals in police uniform,''
said Lt. Gen. P.S. Bogdanov, chief of Moscow's Administration of
Internal Affairs, which controls police affairs.
   ``But we will not stop until our ranks have been cleansed,''
Bogdanov told a recent news conference in remarks published Sunday
by Komsomolskaya Pravda, the national youth daily.
   He said that as a result of investigations in the first half of
1988, about 1,200 Internal Affairs employees in Moscow were fired.
   The official said that in the first six months of 1988, there
was a rise in murder, assault with intent to kill and assault
resulting in serious injury, compared to the same period last year.
   The newspaper report gave no specific figures or reasons for the
change.
   Bogdanov said, however, that the number of all crimes registered
in Moscow declined by 9.6 percent compared to 1987. Violent crime _
excluding murder and assault _ dropped by 4.2 percent, he said.
   He did not give the actual number of crimes registered.
   In the first six months of 1988, Muscovites aged 18 and younger
committed 25.6 percent of the crimes in the city, while juvenile
crime accounted for 22.6 percent of the city's unlawful acts during
the same period in 1987, the police general said.
   The juvenile crimes included robbery, rape, joyriding in someone
else's car and apartment break-ins, he said.
   Bogdanov said his ministry will continue to clean out corruption
in police ranks, a process begun more than a year ago under the
reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

dead has gotten married.
   Mary Vincent, 25, and landscaper Matthew Brockman, 23, were wed
Saturday in the presence of 75 guests, including her 2-year-old
son, Luke, the Modesto Bee reported.
   The location of the wedding wasn't disclosed. It has been
reported previously that after speaking out publicly about the
rape, Miss Vincent sought privacy in the Pacific Northwest.
   Singleton, 60, was convicted of raping Miss Vincent and hacking
off her arms with an ax after picking up the 15-year-old hitchhiker
in September 1978. She was found abandoned and left for dead in a
rural area.
   He repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and was released from
prison in 1987. Singleton spent his parole in a trailer on the
grounds of San Quentin State Prison after his planned parole to a
town about 20 miles northeast of San Francisco was met with
protests. He was freed in April.

<HEAD>King Says West Bank Must Be Palestinian, Not Jordanian</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with senior Jordanian official saying
Hussein has decided to abandon responsibility for government
services in West Bank. No pickup.

   In relinquishing any claim to the West
Bank, King Hussein has also decided to abandon responsibility for
all government services in the Israeli-occupied territory, a senior
government official said today.
   ``It is a complete divorce of this kingdom from the West Bank,''
the official said, commenting on Hussein's address Sunday.
   In a televised speech also seen in Israel and the occupied
lands, the king challenged the PLO to try to make a Palestinian
state of the territory his family ruled until it was seized by
Israel 21 years ago.
   It was the latest in a flurry of moves by Hussein that appeared
to rule out the possibility of Jordan representing Palestinians in
any peace talks.
   The move also acknowledged that the 8-month-old uprising in
Israel's occupied lands has largely looked for leadership to the
PLO, reducing Jordanian influence in the West Bank.
   Hussein said that since there ``is a general conviction that the
struggle to liberate the occupied Palestinian land could be
enhanced by dismantling the legal and administrative links between
the two banks, we have to fulfill our duty and do what is required
of us.''
   The government official, who spoke on conditon of anonymity,
said, ``That means we will not be responsible for any services in
the West Bank ... That land is Palestine and this is a separate
country.''
   He explained that Jordan ``is no longer responsible for
municipalities, health, social, educational, religious or cultural
sectors in the West Bank.''
   But he told The Associated Press ``we will continue to pay
pensions to civil servants and teachers who have been appointed by
the Jordanian government and served our kingdom during the past 35
years.''
   The late King Abdullah, Hussein's grandfather, united both sides
of the River Jordan and merged all institutions and services with
the West Bank when he annexed the area after the 1948 Arab-Israel
war.
   Jordan administered the West Bank until Israel seized it in the
1967 Middle East War and set up a military government that shared
services with local authorities.
   Jordan has since been paying teachers, lawyers and other
employees who work in Arab institutions in the territory.
   On Saturday, Hussein dissolved the lower house of Parliament,
half of whose members represented the West Bank. On Thursday, he
canceled a $1.3 billion development project for Israel's occupied
lands.
   ``Jordan is not Palestine,'' the king said Sunday in his
17-minute address. ``The independent Palestinian state will be
established on occupied Palestinian land after its liberation, God
willing.''
   It was the first time Hussein, who has previously backed the
idea of an independent Palestinian state, told Palestinians in the
West Bank to take affairs into their own hands.
   The move could make the PLO Israel's only potential negotiating
partner in talks to resolve the issue, dashing hopes for Secretary
of State George P. Shultz's peace initiative.
   Under the Shultz plan, Jordan would have been partially
responsible for representing the Palestinians in proposed Middle
East peace talks. Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, calling it a
terrorist organization.
   Shultz, speaking Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' denied
Hussein's moves would pressure the United States and Israel to find
a way to talk to the PLO.
   ``We will stay right where we are. We're ready to talk to them
(PLO) when they take certain steps, which are very clear, and as
far as I can see, not too onerous,'' he said.
   Hussein said Sunday that Jordan's links to the West Bank
``hamper the Palestinian struggle to gain international support for
the Palestinian cause, as the national cause of a people struggling
against foreign occupation.''
   The uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which has claimed
the lives of 235 Arabs and four Israelis, has given greater
international prominence to the Palestinian cause and increased
calls for an independent state.
   Hussein said Sunday that his moves were ``in response to the
wish of the Palestine Liberation Organization ... and the
prevailing Arab conviction that such measures would contribute to
the struggle of the Palestinian people.''
   Today, the senior Jordanian official said it is ``up to the new
Jordanian government to decide on measures to handle the break of
administrative and legal ties with the West Bank and Gaza Strip.''
   He was referring to an expected cabinet reshuffle, the magnitude
of which was not made clear. The official also said he interpreted
the king's speech to indicate Jordan would ``not issue new
Jordanian passports to residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.''
   Two thirds of Jordan's 3.5 million people are of Palestinian
origin and carry the Jordanian passport. All West Bank residents
and some from the Gaza Strip hold the Jordanian passport.
   In his speech, the king called for national unity and said his
West Bank policy would not affect Palestinians living in the rest
of Jordan.
   Hussein was nearly toppled in 1970 during a war with the PLO. In
1951, he witnessed a Palestinian extremist assassinate King
Abdullah.
   In 1970, Hussein cracked down on the PLO's growing independence
and moved to halt PLO raids that were resulting in damaging Israeli
reprisal attacks in Jordan.
   The ensuing ``Black September'' fighting with the PLO came close
to toppling Hussein, who then forced the guerrillas into Lebanon.
Hussein and Arafat reached a reconciliation in the mid-1970s.

   August got off to a blistering start in many central and eastern
states with unusually high temperatures early today, following a
record-setting day of triple-digit heat in six Midwestern states.
   A high pressure system was centered over southeast Missouri on
Sunday night, keeping much of the warmer air across the central and
eastern parts of the nation and bringing comparatively cooler
temperatures to the Pacific Northwest and northern Plateau regions.
   Temperatures early this morning were very warm across much of
the nation with readings in the 70s along much of the East Coast
into the southeast states and parts of the Ohio Valley; and in the
80s across the central and southern Plains into the middle
Mississippi Valley and from southern Wisconsin through much of
South Dakota into southeast Montana.
   Showers and thunderstorms were developing early this morning
across central and southern parts of North Dakota. Other showers
and thunderstorms were moving across eastern parts of upper
Michigan, as well as the Carolina coast and into northern parts of
Florida.
   In North Carolina, rain flooded low-lying roadways at Nags Head
and Collington. More than 2 inches of rain drenched New Hanover,
N.C., early this morning.
   Thunderstorms abated late Sunday night and early this morning
over the central and southern parts of the Rockies. But heavy rain
was reported Sunday afternoon at Prescott, Ariz., where 2\ inches
of rain fell.
   On Sunday, record-setting heat was recorded in Iowa, Wyoming,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and South Dakota.
   In Illinois, several cities sizzled as temperatures climbed past
the 100 degree mark on Sunday. It was 103 degrees in Quincy, and
102 degrees in Peoria, which tied the record for the day set in
1890.
   Minnesota also sweltered. Temperatures reached 105 degrees in
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area on Sunday, the hottest reading in 52
years. Record highs also were reported in St. Cloud and Rochester,
both with 102 degrees. Redwood Falls topped the list with its
reading of 107 degrees.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the northern Rockies into the northern Plains and into the
southern Plateau, across the northern and central areas of the
Great Lakes region and from southern Texas through the Gulf Coast
region into parts of Mississippi and Alabama, through much of
Florida, across the eastern half of North Carolina; and mostly
sunny and hot weather through the remainder of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 90s across much of the
nation; in the 80s from the northern Rockies through the central
intermountain region into the southern Rockies; in the 80s from the
northern parts of the Great Lakes into the upper Ohio Valley and
New England; and from the upper 90s to 105 degrees from the middle
Mississippi Valley into the Central Plains and from the desert
Southwest into the California valleys.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 88 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

   The second leak of a noxious chemical in 3{
months from a Monsanto Chemical Co. plant sent more than 120 people
to hospitals, and at least nine were admitted though none had
serious injuries, officials said.
   Less than three gallons of phosphorous trichloride, a component
of the herbicide Lasso, escaped into the air when a ``rupture
disk,'' designed to break when pressure built up in the tank, gave
way Sunday morning, said Diane Bartolanzo, a Monsanto spokeswoman.
   The leak was plugged within five minutes, and no evacuation was
ordered, she said.
   On April 17, 22 square blocks of neighboring East St. Louis were
evacuated when about 250 gallons of the substance spilled during
loading onto a railroad tank car, officials have said.
   ``It's just a normal thing,'' Willa Dean Tooks, 40, who lives
about four blocks from the plant, said after Sunday's leak. ``We're
always getting fumes.''
   Most people who went to hospitals were released after treatment
for burning eyes, nausea, headaches, shortness of breath and
dizziness, but at least nine people were admitted, hospital
officials said.
   ``My chest was hurting and my eyes was watering and my throat
was ... dry and every time I breathed, it felt like my wind was
cutting out,'' said Danny Cleggett, 22, of East St. Louis. He said
he was at his mother's home, about a mile from the plant, when
fumes entered the home.
   Cleggett was in good condition at Centreville Hospital, said
Donna Weiss, a nurse there.
   Company officials began an investigation immediately after the
leak, Ms. Bartolanzo said.
   She also said that, as in April, the company will pay medical
expenses due to the spill.

<HEAD>Ranks Restored In Chinese Army</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Chinese military celebrated its 61st
anniversary today by restoring a ranking system in a move seen as
critical to its efforts to develop a modern fighting force.
   In related developments Saturday, the People's Liberation Army
bestowed medals on thousands of veterans and announced more than
100,000 soldiers would be transferred to a new civilian staff.
   Western military analysts in Beijing and the official Chinese
media said the moves were connected to reforms aimed at modernizing
China's armed forces and ridding it of the leftist influences.
   The analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said the
ranking system was designed to raise the morale of the army, which
since 1978 has seen many of its factories converted to civilian use
and its troop strength and share of the state budget slashed.
   Mao Tse-tung abolished military ranks 23 years ago as part of
his attempt to create a classless society. China then ascribed to a
fighting philosophy called ``people's war,'' which envisaged an
all-out war fought by a huge peasant army.
   Since China began its economic reforms in 1978, it has moved to
create a professional army with top-notch military equipment.
   Western analysts today said China's poor showing in its brief
war with Vietnam in 1979 also did much to convince military leaders
of the necessity of a strict ranking system.
   In addition, the trouble with Vietnam on the border and over
islands in the South Pacific has led the Chinese to believe future
conflicts will not be an all-out war but ``geographically contained
battles that necessitate a rapid deployment force of highly trained
soldiers,'' said one diplomat.
   ``These kinds of units need a strict command structure, with a
clear delineation as to who is giving and who is receiving the
orders,'' he said. ``Before today they didn't have that.''
   Friday's issue of the People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) said the
move to transfer 100,000 soldiers to civilian status was part of a
program to cut the number of ``officials'' in the army.
   ``The ratio of officials to soldiers is lopsided,'' it said.
``They are too many officers and many of them are too old.''
   Apart from strategic issues, analysts said the ranking system
and the awarding of medals were undertaken to raise morale in the
People's Liberation Army.
   Since 1978, China had reduced the army from 4 million to 3
million men, cut the army's share of the state budget from 17.5
percent to less than 10 percent, and turned military industry
factories to consumer production.
   In addition, the army has all but been shut out of politics.
   Finally, a program to acquire advanced weapons systems has been
slowed because of budget constraints.
   ``If the army is not getting weapons, the least the government
can give them is ranks,'' said one analyst.
   Analysts said China had to award medals and ranks to its
veterans, some of whom maintain a strong influence over the
military, because it would have been an insult to award ranks only
to those currently in service.
   ``Part of the reason all this took so long is that the veterans
were bickering about who was to get which medal or which rank,''
one analyst said, citing Chinese sources. ``They are evidently very
concerned with status.''
   On Saturday, four classes of medals were awarded to about 80,000
veterans.
   According to the official Xinhua News Agency, military officers
in the army will be divided into three grades with 11 ranks: four
ranks of generals, four ranks of field officer _ senior colonel,
colonel, lieutenant colonel and major, and three ranks of company
officer: captain, lieutenant and second lieutenant.
   Previously, officers were given commands of groups such as
platoons and divisions or were assigned to regional command posts,
but there was no clear ranking hierarchy.

   Michael Dukakis begins an expanded effort
this week to win over the black voters he largely ignored in the
primaries and who have yet to respond in any big way to an
endorsement by Jesse Jackson.
   The Democratic presidential nominee travels to Detroit tonight
to address an Urban League convention and, according to an aide,
his campaign this week will begin distributing literature
highlighting his gubernatorial record on issues such as affirmative
action and judicial appointments.
   ``Michael Dukakis is not a known quantity to black Americans but
this should help change that,'' said Donna Brazile, the Dukakis
campaign's deputy national field director.
   Dukakis also plans to invest in black media advertising and will
schedule campaign events in inner city neighborhoods and other
predominantly black areas, Brazile said. He rarely ventured into
black communities during the primaries and still draws relatively
few blacks to campaign events.
   Brazile and other top Dukakis advisers conceded in interviews
during last week's seven-state campaign trip that Jackson's
endorsement of Dukakis at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta has yet to translate into visible support for Dukakis among
blacks.
   One assessment of Dukakis' problem came from Sam Riddle, field
director for Jackson's winning effort in the Michigan caucuses.
   ``All you got in Atlanta was that Jesse got a little prime time,
a credit card and an airplane,'' he said. ``Black America is still
not sure what's in it for them and until that gap is bridged I
don't think you'll see them being too enthusiastic about Dukakis.''
   Dukakis and his staff are trying to erase such sentiments.
   In Newark, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Louisville, Ky., Raleigh, N.C.,
and here in Flint last week, he met with Jackson backers, all of
whom, according to Dukakis aides, pledged their support.
   Shortly after Riddle spoke to reporters during a Dukakis rally
in Flint, he was approached by Boston attorney Fletcher Wiley, a
senior Dukakis adviser who is among the campaign's ranking black
officials.
   ``Sure we've got a problem right now,'' Wiley said later. ``But
we're meeting with the Jackson leaders this trip to start the
process of taking care of it.
   ``We'll get to his people, at the grass-roots level, but you
can't go to the people without first coming together with the
leadership.''
   Leaders who met with Dukakis last week gave positive reviews.
Others already have begun helping the nominee.
   Dukakis was greeted at the Louisville airport by Georgia Davis
Powers, a longtime state senator who was a Jackson backer.
   Ernest James, a Jackson supporter in the primary who was at the
airport to help with the greeting, said the area's black community
``is ready to go for Dukakis. The Jackson people have been
spreading the word, and I think blacks will go with Dukakis.''
   Complicating Dukakis' outreach efforts, aides concede, is
Jackson's still unclear role in the fall campaign and uneasiness
among senior Dukakis advisers over the outspoken Jackson.
   Dukakis moved quickly to distance himself from Jackson's effort
to get involved in talks to free American hostages believed to be
held captive by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon but was careful not
to criticize Jackson himself.
   ``He's an American citizen,'' Dukakis said. ``We agree on a lot
of things and we don't agree on some things.''
   Paul Brountas, the Dukakis campaign chairman and its chief
liaison with Jackson, said he expected Jackson to campaign with
Dukakis soon but said no schedule has been made.
   He promised greater black involvement in Dukakis campaign events

   Sea World officials put a 1,400-pound baby
sperm whale that beached itself near Sanibel Island into a special
pool as they worked to keep it alive long enough to return it to
freedom.
   The week-old male, which arrived Sunday at Sea World, was in
critical condition, said Jerie Jones, spokeswoman for the marine
attraction. ``For an animal like this, (research scientists) will
be on 24-hour watch.''
   The 12-foot-long calf was placed in a rehabilitation pool in an
area not open to the public.
   Beachings of sperm whales are rare, and there have only been
about a half-dozen in the last 25 years, said Jay Gorzelany,
coordinator of the Mote Marine Stranding Program. Very few survive
in captivity.
   The sperm whale, which grows to about 50 feet, is an endangered
species. It feeds primarily on squid and fish and normally lives in
water with depths in excess of 600 feet.
   The whale was found by two fishermen Saturday, beached on a
shoal just south of Sanibel Island and mired in ``ankle deep'' mud.
Florida Marine Patrol officials contacted Mote Marine experts.
   ``We checked him and found his heart rate to be erratic and
rapid, about 60 beats per minute,'' Gorzelany said.
   ``It took 14 people to lift him and carry him about 100 yards to
the truck,'' Gorzelany said. ``We could only move him about 10
yards at a time.''
   Officials don't know why whales beach themselves.

<TEXT>
   Vandals damaged the concrete tomb of
President Corazon Aquino's husband but did not disturb the body, a
military official said today.
   Maj. Hernando Patawaran, spokesman for the Presidential Security
Group, said the damage apparently was done late Friday at the
Manila Memorial Park cemetery and was discovered Saturday.
   Patawaran said the vandals pried loose a concrete slab from the
top of the tomb of Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., who was murdered Aug.
21, 1983.
   Patawaran said park authorities received a telephone call
Saturday saying a bomb had been planted in the tomb. Bomb experts
inspected the site, but found nothing, he said.
   Soldiers guarded the tomb today, and workers said they
reinforced it with steel sheets.
   A witness, who visited the nearby grave of a relative Saturday,
said presidential guards surrounded Aquino's grave.
   Patawaran said officials did not know who vandalized the grave
or why.
   Aquino was shot dead at Manila International Airport moments
after he returned from three years of self-imposed exile in the
United States.
   The slaying fueled opposition to then-President Ferdinand Marcos
that culminated in a military-civilian uprising, which toppled his
administration in February 1986 and brought Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Opposition leaders at the time blamed the Marcos administration
for the killing.
   Forty people, most of them soldiers, are on trial in the
assassination.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was listed
in serious condition this morning, recovering from a near drowning
in her backyard pool, and a doctor says she could be out of the
hospital within a week.
   ``Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get
totally back to normal,'' said Dr. James Little, a neurologist.
``She's very close to normal right now. I think she will continue
to improve. As best as I can tell right now, she probably will
regain full mental functions.''
   Ms. Jordan's condition was upgraded Sunday afternoon from
critical to serious but stable, and she continued to improve Sunday
night.
   ``She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her
own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital
spokeswoman Kari Larsen said.
   Ms. Jordan, 52, gave the thumbs-up sign Sunday to her intensive
care unit nurse and was able to talk.
   ``She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get
well,'' said Dr. William J. Deaton, a pulmonary specialist.
   ``She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of
the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to
a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial
personality. She was joking a little bit this morning,'' Deaton
said Sunday. ``She is vastly improved.''
   Ms. Jordan, who gained national attention during the 1974
Watergate impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter
to Brackenridge Hospital on Saturday after being found floating
face-down in her pool.
   Ms. Jordan's live-in companion, Nancy Earl, called paramedics,
who restored her pulse and breathing.
   Deaton said she came ``within four to five minutes, 10 minutes
at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death.
   ``She does not know what happened and was clearly concerned
about it and had indicated that she didn't think she would go
swimming alone again,'' Deaton said.
   Ms. Jordan was breathing Saturday night only with the help of a
ventilator, but Sunday the device was gone and she was responding
to questions and talking, doctors said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential candidate,
telephoned a message for Ms. Jordan, hospital spokeswoman Carolyn
Hinckley Boyle said. Ms. Jordan made a seconding speech for
Bentsen's nomination at the recent Democratic National Convention.
   Doctors said it isn't known what caused Ms. Jordan to lose
consciousness in the pool, but the lack of oxygen caused cardiac
arrest.
   Deaton said he expected Ms. Jordan to remain in intensive care
for 48 hours and to be hospitalized for about a week.
   The doctors said Ms. Jordan, who has been confined to a
wheelchair for several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis. She
swims as therapy.
   ``She has muscle weakness, and it would be difficult for her to
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any
event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event,
that she had any warning,'' Deaton said.
   Doctors were uncertain how long she was in the pool before being
discovered. Ms. Earl said she returned from a short errand to find
Ms. Jordan unconscious in the pool.
   Ms. Jordan in 1966 became the first black state senator in Texas
history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to

   Thousands of holiday travelers
rushing to board a ferry caused a pier to collapse, leaving at
least 31 people dead and injuring nearly 1,000, officials and news
reports said today.
   Survivors said the upper level of a two-tiered pier in
Butterworth, 180 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur, fell without
warning Sunday afternoon.
   The upper section full of waiting passengers crashed onto people
in cars and motorcycles on the lower level waiting to board the
ferry.
   Victims were pinned beneath steel and timber while firefighters
and port workers tried to free them and search for others.
   Emergency officials said all of those killed were believed to be
Malaysian.
   About 300 people were on the pier and 3,000 were lined up behind
them when the rush to the ferry began, port commission Chairman
Syed Mohhamad Aidid told the national news agency Bernama.
   He said the 40-foot section that collapsed normally held about
200 people.
   The travelers were waiting to make the three-mile trip to Penang
island for the Kwan Yin (Goddess of Mercy) Chinese religious
celebration, held once every 60 years.
   ``Everything happened so fast, I could only scream for help,''
Gee Swee Cain, 41, a supervisor of the passenger ferry at the pier,
told Bernama.
   As soon as the crowd rushed forward, the pier's wooden upper
level gave way, sending hundreds of people plummeting to the lower
level, said Mrs. Gee, who suffered chest and face injuries and a
broken leg. Her husband and 5-year-old child were uninjured.
   ``I screamed for help and heard someone from above telling me to
be patient because at that time nothing could be done to help me,''
Mrs. Gee told Bernama.
   Cheong Ah Chey, 21, who saw the pier collapse, was quoted by the
news agency as saying, ``The crowd at the waiting area was moving
toward the gate to get into the ferry, which had just berthed, when
suddenly the platform below them gave way.''
   Three cars entering the ferry were crushed and a port commission
office was destroyed, officials said.
   The death toll from the collapse was considered likely to rise,
as many of the injured were hospitalized in critical condition,
Bernama quoted police and other officials as saying.
   Hospitals and clinics in the area initially reported 969 people
injured, with 502 admitted and 467 treated and released, Bernama
said. Officials today said 417 people remained hospitalized.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad visited the injured at a
government hospital. He told reporters the government would give
$800 immediately to the family of each victim and that he would
consider further compensation.
   The port commission halted ferry service between Butterworth and
Penang pending an inquiry. Traffic jammed Penang Bridge, the only
vehicle link to the island from the mainland after the closure of
the ferry terminal.
   Despite the accident, Penang was crowded with thousands of
people watching the festive parades in the streets.
   The pier was built in 1956 and repaired from time to time,
Bernama reported. The platform that collapsed was last renovated in
1986, when its planks and bolts were replaced.
   The structure was built with pillars only at the sides of the
structure and not in the center, where the section failed.

<TEXT>
   A 74-year-old man who got lost on his way to
the dentist and ended up 600 miles away says part of the problem
was he'd never been away from home.
   Frank Collier returned to Centreville, Ala., on Sunday following
a 17-hour journey that began at 5 a.m. Friday when he left for his
appointment north of Birmingham. Police stopped him at 10:15 p.m.
Friday as he was driving west in the eastbound lane near Muncie, in
central Indiana.
   ``They knew I didn't have no business on that street and so they
stopped me,'' he told The Indianapolis Star on Sunday from the home
he shares with his mother-in-law. ``I was glad the law stopped me.
I was so glad, I didn't know what to do. I hadn't eaten, I hadn't
drank any water.''
   Authorities gave Collier food and a place to stay until members
of his church arrived Sunday to take him home.
   ``It has been one of the strangest things I've ever been
involved with,'' said Delaware County, Ind., police Officer Dan
Hahn. ``I've been a policeman for 10 years and never had anything
like this. It's a miracle he ever made it up here.''
   Collier told police he was on his way to the dentist but
couldn't find the office. He said he turned around to head home.
   Instead, police believe, he wound up on Interstate 65, which
runs from Chicago to Mobile, Ala. From Indianapolis, I-65 continues
northwest toward Lafayette and Chicago. Muncie does not lie along
the interstate.
   Collier said he stopped to buy gasoline in Indianapolis, and
asked for directions home. But no one knew where Centreville was.
Centreville is in central Alabama, about 25 miles southwest of
Birmingham and about 600 miles from Muncie.
   ``So I just kept driving,'' he said. ``When the law stopped me,
they straightened me out. I hadn't ever been away from home. I
didn't know I was that far away until they told me. They treated me
mighty nice.''
   Collier's mother-in-law, Lula Irvin, 96, said she didn't know
what happened to him until police called her.
   ``He just got on the wrong road and he had never been nowhere,''
she said. ``I was worried when he was gone.''

   An explosion and fire ripped through a two-story
army barracks in north London early today, killing a soldier and
injuring nine people, authorities said. The IRA claimed
reponsibility.
   In a message to the Northern Ireland bureau of the British news
agency, Press Association, the outlawed Irish Republican Army said
its guerrillas laid a bomb in the Inglis barracks in the wooded
Mill Hill neighborhood.
   Police had said there was no immediate indication the 7 a.m.
explosion was caused by a bomb.
   The barracks border the Finchley parliamentary constituency of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a prime IRA target.
   Two major hospitals in the area, Barnet General and Edgware,
reported admitting a total of nine injured, including one who was
in an intensive care unit.
   London Ambulance spokesman Chris Webb had said initially that 10
people were injured. He said the dead man was a soldier.
   Anti-terrorist police rushed to the barracks and sealed off the
area after the explosion, which could be heard more than two miles
away, ripped through a brick single men's dormitory block, the army
said.
   Soldiers dug through rubble to rescue several of the injured who
were trapped by falling masonry.
   One soldier was rescued after being trapped for more than 30
minutes. Col. William Butt, commander of the postal section of the
barracks, said the solider was saved by a radiator that shielded
him from falling bricks and debris.
   Butt said most of the injured had burns or neck and back
injuries.
   The blaze was under control two hours after the explosion,
although pockets of flames remained late in the morning, said
London Fire Brigade spokesman Michael Whitty.
   Construction worker Frank McParland, who was working at the
barracks, told reporters: ``The middle section of the living
quarters is missing. It must have been a very big explosion.''
   ``The building is where the single soldiers live _ that was
where we were working. In the middle it just demolished it like a
pack of cards. I guess about three-quarters of it is still
standing.''
   The Ministry of Defense said the barracks housed members of the
Women's Royal Army Corps and also was used by the Postal and
Courier Depot which is run by 250 staff from the corps, the Royal
Engineers and the Royal Navy.
   All mail for British servicemen and women using the British
Forces Post Office system passes through the depot.
   Scotland Yard Superintendent Anthony Robertson said 15 single
men were housed in the barracks where the explosion occurred.
   ``There was an explosion at Inglis barracks in or near to the
living quarters of army personnel,'' he said in a statement.
``There is one fatality, two seriously injured and several other
injuries.''
   ``It has been shattered,'' Robertson said of the building.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA, which is fighting to end
British rule in mainly Protestant Northern Ireland, frequently
attacks British military personnel.
   Mrs. Thatcher was ``deeply distressed to hear of the explosion''
when she arrived in Perth, Australia, on an official visit, her
London office said. ``She is anxiously waiting for news of the
people concerned and she sends deep sympathy for all the relatives
concerned.''
   In an interiew last week, Jackie Donnelly, spokesman for the
IRA's legal political wing Sinn Fein, said the IRA recognized that
killing British soldiers made more impact in Britain than killing
policemen or soldiers from Northern Ireland.
   ``So from that perspective, the IRA certainly would like to
target more British soldiers,'' he said.
   In May, after a 14-month lull, the IRA resumed attacks on
British army bases on the European continent. In the most recent
attack, nine soldiers were injured on July 13 at Duisburg, West
Germany.
   Among the most serious IRA attacks on the army in mainland
Britain were the July 20, 1982 double bombings in London's Hyde
Park and Regent's Park killing 11 soldiers and seven of their
horses.

<HEAD>Official Says Joint Efforts to Account for MIAs Could Start Within
3 Months</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joint U.S.-Vietnam efforts to account for
1,761 Americans still listed as missing from the Vietnam War could
begin soon, a State Department official said today.
   David Lambertson, assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, made that assessment following four days of
meetings in Hanoi last week between Vietnamese officials and
technical experts from the United States.
   ``While there are certain arrangments that will need to be
worked out, we anticipate that joint activities, surveys,
investigations and excavations could begin quite soon,'' Lambertson
said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   ``We anticipate a substantially higher level of activity over
the next three months,'' said Lambertson, who termed the talks
``quite productive.''
   He said the sites that will be examined remain to be determined.
   In the talks last week, the United States agreed to consider
Vietnam's humanitarian problems in exchange for Vietnamese
cooperation on the MIA matter.
   A leader of the effort to resolve the cases of those still
listed as missing in action said on the same program that her group
views last week's meeting as a sign the Vietnamese hope to put the
issue to rest.
   ``We hope the Vietnamese are serious,'' said Ann Mills
Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Prisoners
of War Missing in Southeast Asia.
   ``I believe this time they are (serious) and I think they've
recognized it's in their own national interest to cooperate in
resolving this,'' she said.
   Despite the increased cooperation, Lambertson said Vietnam's
continued occupation of Cambodia remains as a barrier to
normalization of relations between the two countries.
   ``I believe the Vietnamese understand quite clearly that
normalization is something the United States would be prepared to
enter into in the context of a Cambodian settlement that involves
the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from that country,''
Lambertson said.
   ``We also want one which contains very effective guarantees
against a return to power of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said.
   Representatives from Vietnam, Laos, the Cambodian resistance and
other southeast Asian nations met in Indonesia last week to discuss
an end to the nine-year-old conflict. Vietnam has pledged to
withdraw its 120,000 troops by 1990.
   The Vietnamese withdrawal plan is ``a hopeful sign, but we also
look at it with due skepticism,'' said Lambertson.
   Mrs. Griffiths said talks are quickening with other southeast
Asian nations over MIAs.
   ``We have ongoing efforts with the Laos goverment. There are
encouraging signs there as well, that the pace and level of
cooperation is improving,'' she said. ``I think we'll shortly see
consultations again between Lao and U.S. officials.''
   Vietnam has denied allegations by some American private citizens
that it is holding Americans captured in the war as prisoners.

<HEAD>Iran Claims To Push Iraqis Out Of Three Iranian Towns</HEAD>

   Iraq said its troops withdrew from three
Iranian border towns after disrupting supply lines and capturing
prisoners, but Iran said it repulsed the invaders.
   Iraq said Sunday it will ``maintain our finger on the trigger''
until there is peace. Iran said it will refrain from attacking
Persian Gulf shipping but will stay combat-ready after the
8-year-old war ends.
   Teams of U.N. experts were in the region to work out the
particulars of a cease-fire. U.N.-mediated talks in New York were
set to resume today.
   Tehran radio said Sunday that Iranian forces ``liberated'' the
towns of Qasr-e Shirin, Sar-e Pol-e Zahab and Sumar and
successfully countered what it described as a ``feeble enemy
offensive'' farther north, killing or wounding hundreds of Iraqis.
   On Saturday, Iraq announced its forces had withdrawn from the
three towns.
   The towns are not far from the border and have changed hands
several times over the past 10 days, according to Iranian and Iraqi
accounts.
   An Iraqi offensive Saturday night against the Iranian border
town of Mehran farther south was repulsed with heavy losses, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, the army newspaper Al-Qadissiyah
said that until ``genuine peace'' was assured, ``we will maintain
our finger on the trigger.''
   Similar articles appeared in two other government-run
newspapers, Al-Jumhuriyah and Al-Thawra. The editorials appeared
aimed at dampening public expectations for peace soon.
   Iran and Iraq have been locked in dispute at the United Nations
over Iraq's demand for face-to-face talks before a truce under
terms of U.N. Resolution 598. Iran has rejected direct talks until
a cease-fire is achieved.
   In Tehran on Sunday night, President Ali Khamenei of Iran told
military commanders that even in time of peace, Iran must keep a
combat ready force so that enemies will not think of violating
Iran's rights, IRNA reported.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati of Iran, asked
whether his country would continue to attack neutral ships in the
Persian Gulf, said: ``We will try to do our best not to violate
anything ... so that Resolution 598 will come into reality.''
   Until last week, Iranian vessels had been attacking neutral
shipping in the southern gulf in retaliation for Iraqi attacks on
oil tankers plying Iranian ports.
   Besharati made his comments in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab
Emirates. He is touring Persian Gulf nations in a bid to underscore
what he says is Iran's desire to cooperate with peace moves.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the National Urban League said
today Vice President George Bush is ``passing up a significant
opportunity'' to win black votes in his presidential race by
turning down an invitation to address the group.
   A Bush spokesman has said the expected GOP presidential nominee
will not speak at the group's four-day national conference in
Detroit because of a scheduling conflict. Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis said he would speak to the conference.
   John E. Jacob, Urban League president, said in an interview from
Detroit that many black voters have not yet been swayed to either
candidate.
   ``I think he's passing up a significant opportunity to win some
black votes,'' Jacobs said on the ABC-TV ``Good Morning America''
program.
   Jacobs said Bush had a good civil rights record while in
Congress but has not sufficiently explained his positions on Reagan
administration policies on such issues as voting rights and
affirmative action.
   ``It seems to us we still need to know who the real George Bush
is. We offered him an opportunity to come and tell us who he is,''
said Jacob. ``The contradictions have to be dealt with.''
   The National Urban League is declining to endorse any candidate
for president.
   Jacob on Sunday lashed out at the Republican Party, saying he
questioned its claims of trying to woo black voters in this year's
presidential election.
   He said at a news conference opening the group's four-day
national conference that Bush declined an invitation to address the
gathering ``just as Ronald Reagan didn't come in 1984.''
   On Saturday, Bush spokesman Mark Goodin said a scheduling
conflict prevented the vice president from accepting the
invitation. He said Bush plans to spend this week examining
potential running mates and will deliver a major foreign policy
speech in Chicago on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The space shuttle launch team
completed a practice countdown today despite a fuel leak that
raised the possibility of another postponment of a critical test
firing of Discovery's engines.
   The leak halted fueling of the shuttle's hydrogen tank after it
had been loaded with 254,000 gallons, 67 percent of capacity.
   After assessing the situation, launch director Bob Sieck ordered
the countdown to proceed to obtain data on other aspects of the
count. The liquid oxygen tank received a full load of 143,000
gallons and other procedures were rehearsed.
   The countdown was stopped as planned at 11 seconds before a mock
liftoff by a simulated problem, and the launch team began
practicing steps it would take to recover from a postponement _
making the shuttle safe, draining the propellants and turning the
vehicle around for another countdown and launch attempt.
   A second countdown is to end with the test firing of Discovery's
three main engines, with the shuttle bolted to the pad. The firing
had been scheduled for Thursday, but NASA officials said it might
have to be delayed another day or so because of the leak.
   A decision on when to schedule the firing probably would not be
made before Tuesday, Sieck said
   He said the launch team had done ``an excellent job'' in
completing the countdown despite the difficulty. ``We must now
evaluate the results and schedule the work that needs to be done
before the firing,'' he added.
   The firing already had been postponed four times in 10 days.
   A three-day delay was announced Friday because of a hydrogen
leak and a balky oxygen pump.
   The newest leak was in the same launch pad service mast as the
earlier one, but officials would not know if it was in the same
line until technicians traced it. They will not have access to the
pad until after the launch team completes draining the hydrogen and
oxygen Tuesday.
   NASA said that despite Sunday's leak, it was satisfied that most
requirements of the first part of the countdown had been met.
Objectives missed were to be picked up during a second fueling and
countdown for the test firing.
   Officials believe the practice countdown delays, combined with
an unresolved leak in Discovery's steering engine system, will slip
Discovery's launch date from mid-September into October.
   The purpose of the dual countdown test is to check modifications
made to the engines and launch pad and to provide countdown
practice for the launch team.
   The 20-second engine ignition is considered critical to
certifying Discovery for the first shuttle flight since Challenger
exploded shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew
of seven.
   When the test is completed, officials of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration still must cope with the small
gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from
Discovery's main engines.
   Engineers have come up with a plan to reach and repair the leak
by entering the shuttle's cargo bay and cutting a hole through the
rear bulkhead into the steering engine compartment.
   Another option, with a decision to be made after the
test-firing, is to take Discovery off the pad and back to a hangar
for repair, a move that could postpone the launch until November.

<TEXT>
   Trinidad Silva Jr., who portrayed a gang
leader in the movie ``Colors'' and TV's ``Hill Street Blues,'' was
killed in a crash that also injured his wife and son, police said.
He was 38.
   Silva's pickup truck was broadsided Sunday at an intersection by
a car driven by a man who allegedly was drunk and who was arrested,
said police Sgt. Gene Horsfall.
   Silva, of Whittier, was pronounced dead at the scene, said Dave
Campbell of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.
   In NBC-TV's ``Hill Street Blues,'' Silva played the
wise-cracking gang leader Jesus Martinez, who taunted Capt. Frank
Furillo by calling him ``Frankie boy.''
   He also portrayed ``Frog,'' an older gang leader in ``Colors,''
a performance the Hollywood Reporter called ``mesmerically
engaging.''
   ``From what we can tell, the arrested man went through a red
light and broadsided Mr. Silva's truck, and Silva's truck spun
around and hit the other vehicle,'' Horsfall said.
   Silva's wife, Sofia, 28, and their 2-year-old son, Samuel,
suffered minor injuries and were treated, said Julie Maxwell, a
Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital nursing supervisor.
   Douglas Robert Owens, 35, of La Habra, was booked for
investigation of felony drunken driving, felony hit and run and
vehicular manslaughter, Horsfall said.
   The driver of the other pickup truck was identified as Oscar
Valenzuela, 30. Neither he nor his 3-year-old son were injured, Ms.
Maxwell said. His wife, Norma Valenzuela was treated for minor
injuries.
   A fourth passenger in the Silva vehicle was not injured, Lt.
Jack Johnson said.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl Rowan, a vocal gun
control advocate, was expected to plead not guilty to handgun
charges today in the shooting of a teen-ager who took an uninvited
dip in Rowan's backyard pool in June.
   A group of Rowan's supporters gathered outside the District of
Columbia Courthouse before 9 a.m. to protest Rowan's prosecution.
   Rowan, 62, was charged last week with possessing an unregistered
handgun and ammunition. He faces a penalty of up to two years in
jail and $2,000 in fines if convicted.
   His attorney, Raoul Carroll, told The Washington Times the
columnist planned to ask to have his case heard before a Superior
Court jury.
   ``We can communicate to them that Carl Rowan Jr., who owned the
gun, tried everything in his power to get the gun registered.
District officials did not allow him to do it,'' Carroll said.
   Rowan has said that his son, a former FBI agent, tried to
register the weapon in 1982 but was told that it wasn't necessary
because he was a law-enforcement officer at the time. The elder
Rowan said he later obtained the gun from his son, at a time he was
receiving threats.
   Except for law officers, District of Columbia law generally bans
posession of handguns and ammunition not owned prior to 1976.
   The charges stem from the June 14 shooting of Benjamin Smith,
18, of Chevy Chase, Md., who had climbed over Rowan's backyard
fence to take a late-night swim in the columnist's pool. Rowan told
police shot the intruder in the hand when he thought the teen was
lunging at him.
   Smith was treated and released the same day at from Georgetown
University Hospital. He was charged with one count of unlawful
entry, but prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charge in exchange
for 40 hours of community service.

<HEAD>Charges Dropped Against Brothers in Oakland Bus Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Murder charges have been dropped against
two brothers arrested shortly after men boarded a bus and opened
fire, killing the driver and wounding three passengers, police said
today.
   Sgt. Jerry Harris also said two new suspects have been arrested
in the slaying Friday of Billy Givens. He described the suspects
arrested Sunday night as a 17-year-old male and a 15-year-old male.
Neither was identified.
   Donald Palmer, 25, and David Palmer, 29, were arrested about two
hours after the shooting. Their mother, Ellen Palmer, 52, was
killed Thursday in a collision with a bus driven by a rookie driver.
   Officers talked to witnesses and ``determined that the suspects
were not either of the Palmer brothers, and at about 4 p.m.
(Sunday) we released them on the murder charges,'' Harris said.
   But the brothers ``still have some warrant problems,'' and it
was unclear if they had been released from jail, Harris said.
   Harris said police had determined the teen-agers knew the Palmer
family, but he said there was no indication anyone in the family
had a role in prompting the attack.
   Givens, 43, who worked for AC transit for 20 years, was struck
several times with bullets from a semiautomatic .22 caliber rifle.
   Witnesses said four young men had stepped aboard Givens' bus,
which carried 20 passengers, and shouted obscenities at the driver
before firing 12 rounds.

<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PTL trustee plans to hold several
auctions this month to sell silver coins, stamps and other
valuables found in a vault at PTL headquarters.
   The sale comes as a Canadian real estate executive says he plans
to pursue his offer to pay $113 million for Heritage USA and
operate it as a theme park with no religious overtones.
   Trustee M.C. Benton said the auctions would be Friday, Saturday
and Aug. 12 at the Heritage Grand Hotel.
   Although the collection had been in the vault for some time,
Benton first saw the inside of the vault July 25. Benton said he
looked after deciding to sell assets to raise money for the
financially troubled ministry and Christian retreat.
   ``I started the program of auctioning things we don't need
several weeks ago. The things in this vault are another part of
that program,'' Benton said.
   An appraiser has not completed evaluating the collection.
   Benton said the use of any money raised would be determined by
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.
   PTL filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
bankruptcy laws more than a year ago. It owes creditors an
estimated $130 million.
   The 15-by-16-foot vault contains small bars of 99.9 percent pure
silver, a rack of fur coats, small statuettes of various metals and
old money and stamps.
   Benton said other items that will be auctioned include pieces of
heavy equipment Heritage USA no longer uses and automobiles donated
to the ministry.
   Canadian real estate executive Peter Thomas says Benton is ready
to work with him, according to the Vancouver Sun.
   Thomas, majority stockholder in Century 21 of Canada, told the
newspaper, ``I believe now they'll give it (Heritage USA) to me.''
   Thomas, 49, was born in London and grew up the Canadian province
of Alberta.
   In recent weeks, PTL founder Jim Bakker, who was forced from the
ministry in a sex and money scandal, has said he wants to buy back
PTL's assets and return as its leader. Also in the bidding is
Charlotte, N.C., sports executive George Shinn, who has said he
wants to build a sports complex adjoining Heritage USA.

   An unusual crew left today to climb the
north shoulder of Mount Everest through China and Tibet, a route so
far conquered only by the Chinese and Spanish.
   The group, dubbed ``Cowboys on Everest,'' contains five women,
including two who will attempt the final leg. If Sue Cobb, 50, and
Julie Cheney, 30, are successful, they will become the first
American women to climb the 29,028 feet peak.
   The climb was the idea of Bob Skinner, 58, and his brother
Courtney, 52, who operate a wilderness training school in Pinedale,
Wyo. Their friend, George McCowen of Menlo Park, raised nearly $1
million for the climb, which has become an official part of
Wyoming's centennial celebration.
   Skinner told a news conference on Sunday the 34-member team
includes mountaineers, students, artists, doctors and geologists.
Only six people will make the final summit assault.
   Skinner said the support crew will draw, photograph, teach and
write about the Himalayas when they return.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Edged Up 0.1 Percent in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending edged up 0.1 percent in
June as continued strength in non-residential building offset
declines in housing and government projects, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said building activity rose to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $402.8 billion in June,
following a 0.8 percent increase in May. In April, construction
plunged 1.1 percent after soaring 2.8 percent in March. The June
level was 2.6 percent higher than a year ago.
   The strength came from a 2.5 percent increase in spending on
non-residential construction, which climbed to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $99.2 billion, led by big jumps in both
factory and hotel-motel construction. It was the fourth consecutive
monthly increase.
   Factory construction rose 5.7 percent and now stands 21 percent
higher than it was a year ago. U.S. manufacturers have boosted
investment on new factories because of a surge in export sales
caused by the weaker dollar.
   Hotel and motel construction increased 19.4 percent after
falling for two months.
   Construction of office buildings in June was off by 0.4 percent
from the May level. However, the small decline followed increases
in May, April and March, and the June rate was still 12 percent
higher than a year ago, something of a puzzle to analysts because
of lingering high vacancy rates in that sector caused by widespread
overbuilding in previous years.
   Residential construction fell 0.9 percent in June to an annual
rate of $188.1 billion, the third decline in a row. That sector has
been hurt by an increase in mortgage interest rates since the
spring. A 0.7 percent drop in construction of single-family homes
more than offset a 2.3 percent increase in apartment construction.
   Government construction projects fell 1.4 percent in June to an
annual rate of $78.6 billion with highway construction, the biggest
segment of the government sector, suffering a 1.6 percent decline.

<HEAD>Lottery Winner Charged With Trying To Have Daughter-In-Law Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who won $5 million in Canada's
lottery and allegedly owes as much to the Internal Revenue Service
has now been accused of trying to pay an undercover officer to kill
her daughter-in-law, police said.
   Hillsborough County Sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa said Mary
Ellen Futch, 64, on Saturday ``negotiated a contract with our
undercover detective for $5,000'' to kill Peggy Futch, 23.
   If convicted of soliciting for the first-degree murder, Mrs.
Futch could face up to a 30-year prison sentence. Mrs. Futch was
being held without bond at the Hillsborough County Jail.
   ``She never would let me have any friends,'' said Henry Futch,
28, whose mother won the money on Sept. 15, 1984. ``She would
always chase them off whenever I'd bring one home.''
   Mrs. Futch received her winnings in a lump sum and since has
frittered the money away, relatives say. She bought a house to be
near her youngest son, whom family members said she doted on. News
reports at the time said she once tipped a man $7,000 just to play
pool with her son.
   She also gave away some money, then made bad investments in
Canada. And she failed to pay any income tax in the United States,
authorities say.
   The IRS, which says the $5 million is due in back taxes,
interest and penalties, has seized her home and plans to auction it
Wednesday, her son said.
   Her son and Peggy Futch, who were married two years ago, both
were surprised at the charge.
   ``She was over here yesterday, laughing and drinking coffee,''
Peggy Futch said. ``We had our spats, but I would apologize to her
or she would apologize to me. That's why I was so shocked.''
   Futch said the money troubles left his mother distraught.
   Espinosa declined to disclose a motive for the alleged
contract-murder deal.

<TEXT>
   Four Soviet missiles were blown apart today at a
test range on the steppes of Central Asia as the Soviet Union began
destroying more than 1,700 missiles banned by a superpower treaty,
Tass said.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, who today arrived for a
four-day visit to the Soviet Union, hailed the destruction of the
missiles as a ``great event.''
   Tass said that at noon Moscow time, four Soviet short-range
missiles known in the West as SS-12s were destroyed in the presence
of U.S. inspectors at the Saryozek test range in Soviet Kazakhstan,
about 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow.
   Western reporters watched from a distance of about two miles as
a single explosion tore apart the four missiles.
   The blast dug a crater about 65 feet wide, and spread debris
from the missiles over several hundred yards, they said. The
explosion sent a huge cloud of smoke into the blue sky over the
steppe, the Western reporters said.
   Col. Stanislav Petrenko, chief of operations, told reporters the
nuclear warheads mounted on the SS-12s had been removed before the
rockets were destroyed and that the charges would be used for
peaceful purposes.
   The Soviet Union has used nuclear explosions for oil
prospecting, large-scale construction projects and other purposes.
   Petrenko told Western reporters that an explosion would take
place at the Saryozek site every day for the next 18 months. Tass,
the official Soviet news agency, said other Soviet missiles banned
by the superpower treaty would be destroyed over the next three
years.
   The superpowers signed a treaty in December banning their
medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles. It is the first arms
agreement between the two nations that calls for the destruction of
an entire class of weaponry.
   Under the treaty, the Soviets must eliminate 1,752 missiles with
a range of between 310 miles and 3,410 miles that have been
deployed or are in storage, Tass said.
   The United States has said it will scrap 859 Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles now stationed in Western Europe.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed by
President Reagan and Soviet Communist Party general secretary
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, calls for each country to allow inspectors
from the other side to verify that the rockets have been eliminated.
   On April 11, the Soviet Union said it blew up six SS-12 missiles
in a test designed to develop a method to destroy missiles under
the treaty. The United States also conducted such tests.
   Carlucci, when asked by reporters how he evaluated the
destruction of the missiles, said, ``I think it's a great event.
I`m very pleased to see it.''
   His host, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, added, ``It
means that we are starting to carry out the obligations which were
achieved earlier, especially as a result of the four summit
meetings in Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington and Moscow.''
   Tass said the destruction of the missiles ``will lead to a
substantial lowering of the level of military confrontation in
Europe and to the lessening of the risk of global nuclear
conflict.''

   Israel deported eight Palestinians today, the
military said, as fellow Palestinians in the occupied territories
held a commercial strike to protest the Israeli policy of
expulsions.
   The deportations came a day after Jordan's King Hussein
announced he was severing ties with the 850,000 Arabs in the
occupied West Bank he once ruled.
   The eight Palestinians were visited by their families at Jneid
Prison in the West Bank before being driven away, relatives said.
   A military spokesman said they were taken to Israel's northern
border with Lebanon.
   Among the deportees was a journalist with Jerusalem's Arabic
language Al Fajr newspaper, Loui Abdo, who was accused of leading a
Palestine Liberation Organization-linked youth group in the West
Bank city of Nablus, security sources said.
   Other deportees included a lecturer from the Bir Zeit University
near Ramallah and a labor leader from nearby El Bireh, they said.
   The expulsions brought to 29 the number of Palestinians deported
since the beginning of the eight-month Arab uprising.
   Some Palestinians denounced Hussein today as a traitor for
severing ties with them, but others praised the monarch for ceding
to the PLO as their sole representative.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Hussein's decision to divorce
himself from the occupied West Bank dealt a blow to the idea of a
united Palestinian nation.
   Hussein said in his speech he intended to cut legal and
administrative ties with the West Bank, which he ruled before
losing the area to Israel during the 1967 Middle East War.
   The decision was a setback for Foreign Minister Shimon Peres'
Labor Party, which had proposed resolving the dispute with the
Palestinians by negotiations with Jordan. A government official
today disclosed that Peres had tried through foreign intermediaries
to persuade Hussein not to break ties.
   In at least two West Bank cities, Arabs scribbled slogans on
walls denouncing Hussein. ``Down With Hussein, The Traitor,'' one
said in the city of Tulkarm.
   Other Palestinians disagreed.
   ``It's a good gesture for the Palestinians and it should start
the ball rolling in the direction of working out strategic
relationships between the PLO and Jordan on the future,''
Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab of the Nazareth daily A-Sinara
told Israel radio.
   Shamir, speaking to New Zealand's new ambassador, said Hussein
had ``dealt a blow'' to the idea of a Palestinian state by
differentiating between Palestinians living on the east bank of the
Jordan River and those in the West Bank.
   ``If as Hussein says one part of them has to set up a
Palestinian state and another part is Jordanian ... where then is
the one Palestinian people,'' an aide quoted Shamir as saying.
   ``It is possible to draw the conclusion that the whole idea of a
Palestinian people is an invention for the sake of propaganda,''
Shamir added.
   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes territorial concessions
to the Arabs and believes the West Bank and Gaza Strip are integral
parts of the historic land of Israel.
   Peres said the effect of Hussein's announcement was still not
known because he had not said how he would carry out his decision.
But analysts said Hussein's speech may hurt the Labor Party in
November elections.
   The Likud ``can exploit this and claim Peres' concept of
negotiations with Jordan has collapsed,'' said Middle East expert
Aryeh Shalev.
   Hussein, while not ruling out the likelihood that Jordan would
take part in negotiations, made it clear the Palestinians must
speak for themselves.
   A government official close to Peres, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Peres had tried through foreign diplomats to
dissuade Hussein from making his speech, telling them Israel
``still believes in a need for peace talks with Jordan.''
   The Israeli daily Haaretz said one of the intermediaries was
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who it said passed a
message from Peres to Hussein last month.
   Editorials in Palestinian-owned newspapers voiced confusion over
Jordan's plans.
   Some were fearful Hussein could cancel Jordanian passports held
by many of the 850,000 Palestinians in the West Bank or even close
bridges connecting the West Bank to Jordan, a vital economic link
to the Arab world.

<DATELINE>NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican war for Virginia's
gubernatorial nomination has heated up with U.S. Sen. Paul S.
Trible Jr.'s announcement of his candidacy, with opponents
attacking his fund-raising, reasons and timing.
   U.S. Rep. Stan Parris, an announced candidate for the
nomination, charged Saturday that Trible's fund-raising for next
year's election is taking money away from this year's GOP
candidates for the U.S. House, Senate and presidency.
   ``There is only a finite amount of money you can look for in any
one year,'' Parris said Saturday after Trible supporters announced
they already had raised $527,400 in cash and pledges for his
campaign.
   Parris said he would not raise money for his campaign until
after the November elections.
   Former state Attorney General Marshall Coleman is an
all-but-declared candidate. Democrats are expected to nominate Lt.
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the state's highest elected black official.
   Trible, who announced his candidacy Saturday, had announced last
year that he would not seek a second term in the Senate because it
took him away from his family too much, and because he was
frustrated with the slow pace of the Senate.
   Coleman said Trible should not look upon the governor's job
simply as better working conditions.
   ``My interest in the governorship is not in better working
conditions. What is needed is to change the course of the state.
What the Republicans in Virginia are going to want to know is what
a candidate for governor is going to do to make the state better. I
don't look at the governorship as a seat to warm,'' Coleman said.
   Parris and Coleman have charged that Trible is giving up his
Senate seat to avoid a tough campaign against former Gov. Charles
S. Robb, the Democratic nominee for the Senate.
   The GOP nominee, Maurice Dawkins, is given little chance of
beating Robb.
   Mark Rozell, a political scientist from Mary Washington College,
said Trible faces problems with the party's conservative wing,
which is unhappy with his performance on the Senate committee
investigating the Iran-Contra affair. They charge that Trible, who
criticized the administration's handling of the matter, unfairly
attacked President Reagan.

   Allstate Insurance Co. enacted a smoking
ban today in its 5,800 buildings and agent offices nationwide,
becoming one of the largest companies to do so.
   The ban, announced in February, prohibits smoking by employees
in any facility, including insurance centers in Sears outlets and
property assessment offices. Allstate is owned by Sears, Roebuck
and Co.
   The company has not decided what action to take with customers
who smoke. No-smoking signs will be posted in all offices, and
there will be no ashtrays. But a spokeswoman said there is no order
to tell customers who insist on smoking to refrain from doing so.
   The company based in this Chicago suburb initially tried to
establish no-smoking sections, said Ed Dixon, vice president of
human resources, but later decided the compromise did not meet its
needs.
   ``This is definitely one of the largest companies to take this
kind of a stand,'' said Janet Williams of the Chicago Lung
Association.
   Allstate employees and family members who smoke were offered
reimbursements up to $200 if they sought to quit through no-smoking
programs.

<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf state of Qatar today
announced it has established diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union,
less than a month after taking a similar step with China.
   A joint statement released in Doha and Moscow said the two
countries took the step to ``strengthen the bonds of friendship and
cooperation.''
   Qatar's diplomatic ties with China were announced July 9.
   The moves come after Washington in June formally protested this
central Persian Gulf state's refusal to hand over U.S.-made Stinger
missiles it bought on the black market.
   Qatar belongs to the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, an
economic and security alliance that also includes Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
   In addition to Qatar, the other nations in the alliance who have
diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union are Kuwait, Oman and the
United Arab Emirates. All member states of the alliance have been
traditionally pro-Western.
   But after Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power, he
activated contacts with the oil-rich Persian Gulf region and the
sale of arms became a growing factor in the relationship.
   The Saudi monarch, King Fahd, last week said that his country
was not against buying arms from communist nations, although Riyadh
later underlined its strong ties to Washington.

Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen teen-agers from four high schools
are burning the midnight oil and working Saturdays for a shot at
winning a $1 million supercomputer for their school.
   ``We had to twist their arms to let us stay until 2 a.m.,'' said
contestant Roland Feldmeier, 18, who just graduated from James
Logan High School in Union City, Calif.
   The teen-agers from Union City; Silver Spring, Md.; Tallahassee,
Fla., and Alexandria, Va., arrived in late June for the competition
at ETA Systems, a 5-year-old maker of supercomputers, where they're
using an ETA10-P supercomputer on projects they devised. A winner
will be announced Aug. 12.
   Each student is getting $3,000 for participating, and each of
the four high schools is assured of winning a $50,000 workstation
made by Control Data Corp., ETA's parent.
   The students' projects range from complex analyses of how to
design computer problems to a model of school hall traffic.
   All seek to take advantage of a supercomputer's capacity to make
millions of calculations far more quickly than other computers.
   Maneesh Agrawala, 16, is using the computer to create
mathematical models of proteins.
   Agrawala, who will be a junior this fall at Montgomery Blair
High School in Silver Spring, Md., is the son of a computer science
professor at the University of Maryland and began programming small
computers in the seventh grade.
   Asked whether the students at ETA could be considered
single-minded computer jocks, 17-year-old Troy Carroll replied:
``People could get that impression of me, but not of everybody
else. There are some real well-rounded people here.''
   Carroll, from North Florida Christian School in Tallahassee, has
had several personal computers and runs a computer bulletin board
from his home. He's working on a model of the international trade
economy, trying to show the long-range effects of small changes in
trade policy, such as higher tax rates.
   Feldmeier is simulating the hall traffic in his high school,
trying to determine a better way to assign students' lockers to
keep crowding between classes to a minimum.
   ``I've walked through those halls for four years,'' he said. ``I
know how bad it is. Our school superintendent is real excited about
the program.''
   The fourth team is from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science
and Technology in Alexandria, Va.
   The four schools selected on the basis of proposals from 99
semifinalists, chosen from a field of 1,500 applicants.
   ETA is struggling to reach profitability and acknowledges the
public relations benefits of the contest. But the contest, known as
Superquest, is also a personal project for company President Carl
Ledbetter.

<TEXT>
   The new operators of Texas' largest bank holding
company plan to emphasize smaller markets in their reorganization
of First RepublicBank Corp.
   ``The Texas marketplace holds good long-term potential,'' said
Hugh McColl, chairman of the Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB, which on
Friday began operating First RepublicBank as NCNB Texas National
Bank. ``With the exception of real estate, corporate and middle
markets are alive and well in Texas.''
   NCNB officials said Saturday they plan to rebuild the company by
serving small- and middle-sized businesses, by using an Internal
Revenue Service provision for tax loss write-offs and with some
help from businessman H. Ross Perot.
   First RepublicBank Corp. was declared insolvent Friday by the
U.S. comptroller of the currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which loaned First Republic $1 billion in March, called in
its note.
   When the flagship bank could not repay the obligation,
authorities took over the bank and its subsidiaries across the
state and the FDIC, contributing up to $4 billion, awarded them to
NCNB.
   As a condition of the sale, NCNB agreed to use its corporate
name as part of its new identity, company officials said.
   The North Carolina company, with $28.6 billion in assets, will
contribute $210 million to $240 million in new capital.
   Perot guaranteed NCNB's contribution, although he said Saturday
he doesn't believe he will be called upon to invest.
   The transaction states the FDIC will initially hold a 20 percent
stake in NCNB Texas National. Over the next five years, NCNB firm
will have the option to buy 100 percent interest.
   As it gradually increases its position in NCNB Texas National,
the corporation plans to sell public stock, said Timothy P.
Hartman, NCNB chief financial officer.

   Nineteen cars, five of them containing
hazardous materials, derailed today as a 105-car freight train
rolled through a remote river valley, officials said.
   ``The report is that there is no leak from any of these cars,''
said CSX spokesman Lindsay Leckie in Jacksonville, Fla.
   None of the cars entered the Youghiogheny River, said Betsy
Mallison, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental
Resources.
   The Youghiogheny, a key recreation resource for southwestern
Pennsylvania, was closed for 10 miles, state officials said. A
biking trail and a hiking trail also were closed.
   None of the three train crew members was injured, Leckie said.
   Two boxcars containing pulp board, a raw material in paper
making, burned, he said.
   Amtrak's Capitol Limited, which uses the CSX line, was detoured
to Philadelphia, adding four hours to the Pittsburgh-to-Washington
run, said Amtark spokesman Clifford Black. Some passengers were
taken by bus.
   The CSX accident occurred around 3 a.m. at a site is accessible
only by rail, forcing hazardous materials teams to ride railcars to
the wreckage, about 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
   The CSX train was en route from Cumberland, Md. to Willard,
Ohio, Leckie said.

   Drought-stricken farmers could get federal
financial help as early as Oct. 1, U.S. Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng said today.
   The timing would depend on whether Congress reaches a compromise
on two drought-aid bills it is considering and passes a measure
within the next two weeks.
   Lyng spoke at a news conference before his keynote address to
the Soil and Water Conservation Society's annual meeting, which
started Sunday and continues through Wednesday.
   Lyng said that ``although recent rains have made the countryside
much greener, it hasn't saved the chief product of the nation's

<TEXT>
   All Western hostages may be released from Lebanon
by the end of the year, an Australian archbishop predicted today
after a mission to the Iranian capital.
   Also today, the Foreign Office said Britain is reviewing its
relations with Iran, including the possibility of sending a
diplomat to Tehran.
   ``I would not be surprised if Terry Waite and the others were
released before the end of the year,'' Archbishop David Penman of
Melbourne told reporters in Canterbury.
   ``It's my intuition that it (the hostages' release) will come
after the U.S. and Israeli elections'' in November, said Penman,
who visited Tehran en route to England.
   Waite, the envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie,
disappeared in Lebanon on Jan. 20, 1987 while seeking the release
of American hostages.
   Eighteen Westerners, including nine Americans, are missing after
apparent kidnappings by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. The longest
held is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said the review in relations with
Iran was prompted in part by Iran's acceptance of a United Nations
resolution calling for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war against
Iraq.
   ``British ministers are reviewing the whole gambit of
Anglo-Iranian relations including the possibility of sending a
diplomat to Tehran for a short period of time,'' the spokesman
said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Sunday, the Church of England disclosed that the Rt. Rev.
John Brown, bishop of Cyprus and the Persian Gulf region, went to
Lebanon last week seeking word on four Iranians who disappeared
there in 1982. They were presumed kidnapped by Christian militia
and some reports have said they are dead.
   Brown said he hopes his mission contributed to efforts to win
the release of foreign hostages.
   ``It's very important to us when we are talking to the Iranians
... to show them that we are concerned about their missing people
as well as ours,'' Brown said.
   He said he met with the leaders of the Maronite Church and the
Armenian church community and ``they have promised to make
inquiries of their own communities.''
   Iran's only diplomat in London, charge d'affaires Akunzadeh
Basti, had a meeting at the Foreign Office today and said afterward
Iran would use its influence to get information about the hostages.
   Basti said Iran hoped to normalize relations with Britain. ``I
think a better atmosphere is developing,'' he said.
   Britain and Iran recently settled a dispute over compensation
for damages to diplomatic buildings in each other's countries. A
delegation of British parliamentarians also visited Tehran to
discuss improving relations.
   Among the British hostages are journalist John McCarthy,
kidnapped in April 1986, and teacher Brian Keenan, who disappeared
the same month. Keenan also holds Irish citizenship.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a
New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim
they killed him. His body was never found.

<TEXT>
   The Burmese government announced today
it arrested the country's most prominent dissident and nine other
people to prevent an attack against the state.
   Official Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, said action would
be taken against dissident Aung Gyi and the nine others ``according
to criminal law procedures.''
   The broadcast did not mention Associated Press correspondent
Sein Win or several other people said to have been detained in a
sweep last week.
   ``In order to prevent an attack against the state, as
preventative measures, authorities ... detained Aung Gyi and his
associates...as from July 29, 1988,'' the announcement said.
   It was the first official word of the arrests, which had been
reported by Western diplomats in Rangoon, Burma's capital, and the
U.S. State Department.
   The men listed in the broadcast were retired military officers,
many of whom had supported former leader Ne Win in his early years
in power. Most are in their mid- to late 60s.
   Ne Win resigned abruptly last month after 26 years of
authoritarian rule. He was replaced by Sein Lwin, a former general
known for his brutal suppression of dissent.
   The U.S. Embassy in Burma today reportedly made an official
inquiry into the status of AP correspondent Sein Win, who diplomats
said was being held with the others at Insein prison on the
outskirts of Rangoon.
   Leaflets circulated by student groups in the city, meanwhile,
called for a nationwide strike Aug. 8 against the current regime,
Western diplomatic sources said.
   The sources, who asked not to be further identified, said at
least some of the leaflets came from the All Burma Universities
Students Democratic League, which has been demanding the removal of
new leader Sein Lwin.
   Aung Gyi, 70, emerged this year as the most outspoken critic of
Burma's government through a series of letters he wrote decrying
economic and political conditions in Burma.
   In the letters, which were widely circulated in Rangoon, Aung
Gyi singled out Sein Lwin for ``turning a blind eye'' to gross
human rights abuses during bloody student riots last March and June.
   The radio broadcast said those arrested along with the
70-year-old Aung Gyi were Kyi Han, Tun Win, Ba Shwe, Khin Nyo, Kyi
Maung, Tun Shwe, Chit Ko Ko, Aung Win and Zaw Win.
   Retired colonels Kyi Muang and Khin Nyo were in Ne Win's
Revolutionary Council after he seized power in 1962. Kyi Maung left
Ne Win's government in 1963 and Khin Nyo was fired in 1965.
   Han Kyi has once served as military attache in Washington and as
ambassador to Manila. Ba Shwe formerly served as ambassador to
India.
   The diplomatic sources said Aung Shwe, a former general who once
was ambassador to Australia, also was held.
   Rangoon was reported quiet today after a week of major
leadership changes and one small student demonstration.
   Virtually all the country's institutes of higher learnig were
closed following student riots in June. They are scheduled to open
later this month.
   Reporter Sein Win, 66, a onetime publisher of the
English-language newspaper The Guardian, was awarded the Golden Pen
of Freedom by the Paris-based International Federation of
Journalists in 1963. He was jailed for three years in the 1960s
along with thousands of other political prisoners.

   Jesse Jackson and New York Mayor Edward I. Koch
said today they are willing to meet and try to heal or at least set
aside the differences that have simmered since Koch's strong
criticism of Jackson before the New York primary.
   Jackson, who lost the April primary and later the Democratic
presidential nomination to Michael Dukakis, said Koch called him at
his Chicago home early today ``and said he would like to meet.''
   ``I have always kept open the door to communications. I believe
that people should talk,'' Jackson said in a telephone interview
from his home.
   He said he was ``concerned that in New York because of (Koch's)
attacks, we missed a great opportunity to discuss urban policy in
this country.''
   Koch's criticism last April included a statement that Jews would
be ``crazy'' to vote for Jackson, who supports Palestinian
self-determination.
   ``My feelings toward the mayor are always open and respectful,''
Jackson said. ``His toward me were very hostile.''
   Jackson said Koch ``used race and religion as litmus test and
divided the city and helped to lower the moral tone of the
campaign.''
   He said he told Koch that if they are to meet, it should be
arranged through David Dinkins, Manhattan borough president, and
Rep. Charles Rangel, and the meeting should include black leaders
such as those two, both of whom are Jackson supporters.
   ``The leaders ought to meet and work out a common agenda,''
Jackson said.
   In New York, Koch said he would call Dinkins to arrange a
meeting with Jackson ``as soon as possible so we could get behind
Dukakis.''
   Koch said he was not trying to line up support among blacks _
through Jackson _ for his own re-election campaign next year.
   ``I'm not in contention this year,'' he said. ``And if you
really believe as I do that it's important to have a Democrat in
the White House, you set aside those differences.''
   The mayor said he told Jackson, ``I would want to meet with him
as soon as possible. We had the same goal,'' the election of
Dukakis.
   Because of Koch's statements before the New York primary,
``There was no focus on the crisis of homelesses nad the
relationship between drugs and AIDS as a growing killer epidemic,''
Jackson said.
   ``I would think the Democratic leadership must come together
from various walks of life,'' he said.
   Jackson said Sunday he had accepted New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's
request to smooth over differences with Koch, The New York Times
reported today.
   ``Governor Cuomo has expressed interest in the relationship
being healed,'' Jackson told the Times. ``I think that's good.''
   Koch said in a statement: ``I agree that in the interest of
party unity and the election of Michael Dukakis, it would be good
to meet with Jesse Jackson.''
   Cuomo said Sunday he talked with Jackson on Friday, and that he
had told Jackson and Koch ``how important I thought it was to put
things together again.''
   Koch and Cuomo said a first meeting should be attended by only
the three. Koch added Sunday that he ``would have no hesitancy in
sitting down with Jesse Jackson and any black leaders he would like
to bring.''
   On the WCBS-TV Sunday program ``Newsmakers,'' Koch said: ``It's
hardly likely that Jesse Jackson and his intimate supporters _ you
know, the ones closest to him _ are ever going to support me. We
have fundamental differences.''
   But he said they could work together, noting that ``there are
probably wider differences between Jesse Jackson and (Democratic
vice-presidential nominee) Lloyd Bentsen than between Jesse Jackson
and me.''

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told a top-level
Soviet military class today he has difficulty reconciling Kremlin
claims of a defensive strategy with its excessive military spending
and offensive weapons stocks.
   On the first day of a visit expected to offer a close-up view of
some Soviet bases and hardware, Carlucci and his host, Defense
Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, both called for straight talk on the
issues that divide their nations.
   Speaking at Moscow's Voroshilov military academy, Carlucci said
questions remain ``by and large open'' on the sincerity of Soviet
claims to be rethinking defense strategy.
   ``We have difficulty in reconciling a defensive doctrine with
what we see in Soviet force structure and operational strategy as
an emphasis on the offensive,'' he told the academy class.
   ``We also have difficulty reconciling the U.S.S.R.'s pledge not
to be the first to use nuclear weapons with your continuing
emphasis on heavy ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles), such
as the SS-18,'' Carlucci said.
   He said he found Yazov and other senior Kremlin military men
``articulate and willing,'' but deemed the signs of actual change
in the system ``ambiguous.''
   Carlucci said the Strategic Defense Initiative, known as ``Star
Wars,'' would remain part of the U.S. military plan as long as
Washington sees on the Soviet side ``a capability more compatible
with a military doctrine that emphasizes pre-emptive nuclear
strikes.''
   At the opening of his talks with Yazov, Carlucci called for
``talk in direct terms'' about the superpowers' divergent views on
defense.
   ``Yes, we are soldiers,'' Yazov agreed, with a decisive nod of
the head. The first session between the superpower defense chiefs
included Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, who
last month completed a tour of U.S. defense installations that set
the tone of openness being accorded to Carlucci here.
   The U.S. defense chief said he was ``totally satisfied'' with
the access he will be given to military bases and equipment during
his four-day visit.
   At the beginning of July, Akhromeyev saw flight operations on
the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, the inside of a B-1
bomber and toured a Minuteman missile training facility.
   In return, U.S. officials let it be known that they wanted to
see the Soviets' top-secret Blackjack bomber and visit Soviet ships
at sea.
   Yazov said he believed Carlucci's program will include a look at
the Blackjack bomber ``among other military hardware.''
   The Moscow meetings will be the third session between the
defense chiefs of the superpowers. Carlucci and Yazov first met in
Berne, Switzerland, in March, and they also held talks during the
Moscow summit in late May.
   Carlucci is accompanied by Assistant Secretary of Defense Ron
Lehman and representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
State Department.
   Soviet media have focused much attention on Carlucci's visit,
promising a closeup look at the Kremlin's military installations
and declaring the exchange a good chance to ease tensions between
the superpowers.
   ``In the Soviet Union they attach much importance to contacts
between the military of the Soviet Union and the U.S., since those
contacts aim at improving mutual understanding of military aspects
of Soviet-American relations, at solving the most important problem
of today _ the prevention of a nuclear war and cessation of the
arms race,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass said today.
   Carlucci is to go Tuesday to the Taman base outside the capital
and to the Kubinka airfield _ both in closed zones normally
off-limits to foreigners.
   On Wednesday, the delegation flies to the Crimean peninsula for
the American side's first official look at the Black Sea fleet
headquartered in Sevastopol.
   Carlucci leaves the Soviet Union on Thursday for Turkey.

   A federal court jury is weighing the evidence at
the Wedtech corruption trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi and six
co-defendants charged with racketeering.
   The panel, which is not sequestered, went home at 5:30 p.m.
Sunday and was to resume deliberating this morning, but because of
a communications mixup which sent their transportation to the wrong
address, three jurors had not arrived at the courthouse by noon.
   The jury began deliberations Saturday after more than four
months of testimony and a week of closing arguments by the
prosecution and defense.
   Biaggi, D-N.Y., former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon and
five other people are charged with turning the now-defunct Wedtech
Corp., a Bronx-based defense contractor, into a racketeering
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain
no-bid government contracts.
   The others co-defendants are Biaggi's oldest son, Richard;
Biaggi's former law partner, Bernard Ehrlich; Peter Neglia, a
former regional head of the Small Business Administration; and
Richard Betso, a former policeman and friend of Neglia's.

   Two leading Czechoslovak soccer
players have defected to Britain after vanishing from their team
last week in West Germany, the official media reported.
   Ivo Knoflicek and Lubos Kubik, former stars of the Czechoslovak
national soccer team, have not been heard from since they left
their teammates on a tournament Wednesday.
   Czechoslovak television reported Saturday that the athletes, who
play for the Slavia Prague team, ``failed to return with their
team,'' the term widely used to describe defections to the West.
   The daily Mlada Fronta on Monday quoted Rudolf Kocek, chairman
of Czechoslovak Soccer Association as saying that Knoflicek, 26,
has had an offer from Derby County, a British first division squad,
for some time.
   Knoflicek and Kubik, 24, apparently impressed British fans and
managers with their play in a European championship qualifier in
which Czechoslovakia tied Wales 1-1 in Wrexham last year.

   Three days after warring gang members ended
truce talks with a call for a week of peace and prayer, two people
were killed and at least five other people were injured in
gang-related violence, police said.
   Police said William Douglas Randle, 18, of Los Angeles, was the
first person to die since members of two street gangs, the Crips
and the Bloods, met last week and called on other members to
refrain from violence for one week and observe seven days of prayer.
   Randle died Sunday, about an hour after he was shot while
standing with a group of people in a parking lot, said police Sgt.
Steve LaRoche.
   An estimated 15 shots were fired from a passing car police
believe was filled with suspected Crips gang members, LaRoche said.
   A second person was wounded. Edward Domingus, 17, of Los
Angeles, was in critical condition today at Daniel Freeman Memorial
Hospital in Inglewood, according to a nursing supervisor.
   In another drive-by, gang-related shooting, Douglas Henegen, 21,
of Merced was killed Sunday night at Hansen Dam Park, said police
Detective Albert Ferrand. No arrests were made, he said.
   In another incident Sunday, two men were injured, one
critically, when they were struck by shots fired from a passing
car, police said.
   An unidentified 20-year-old was in critical condition and
undergoing surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center today, according
to nursing supervisor V. Pascua. The second victim's identity and
condition were not immediately known.
   Sgt. Tony Rosa said the violence was believed to be gang-related.
   A shooting earlier Sunday left one man in critical condition
with a wound to the head at Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Van Mosley said authorities
don't know if that shooting was gang-related.
   In a shooting about 5 a.m. Sunday, a juvenile was listed in
serious but stable condition today at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center
after being injured in a gang-related shooting, Rosa said.
   Another man was injured in a drive-by shooting Saturday night.
The victim was hospitalized in stable condition with wounds to the
thigh and hand.
   The police anti-gang task force has arrested 9,000 people
identified as gang members in four months. There were at least 174
killings by gang members in the first half of this year in Los
Angeles County. Last year, there were 387 gang-related slayings,
the highest ever.

<HEAD>Vietnam Says U.S. Hindering Agreement On Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Monday blamed U.S.
negotiators for a lack of progress on the proposed emigration to
the United States of thousands of former political prisoners and
their relatives.
   Talks were held July 14-15 by U.S. and Vietnamese negotiators in
Hanoi on resettlement of people who were put into ``re-education
camps'' because of ties to the United States during the Vietnam
War, and a joint communique issued at the time indicated an
agreement had been reached.
   The official Vietnam News Agency reported Monday that Vietnam
``showed its goodwill and readiness to cooperate with the U.S. side
in solving the question as soon as possible. However, the
discussions brought about no result due to the U.S. side's negative
attitude.''
   ``The two sides are continuing to discuss the U.S. side's
guarantee that it shall not ... tolerate any hostile activities
against Vietnam by the released re-education camp inmates when they
are resettled in the United States,'' said the report, monitored in
Bangkok.
   ``The biggest obstacle lies in the U.S. side's refusal to set up
a working group to organize the emigration to the United States of
about 500,000 people, including relatives of the released inmates,
and to oversee the execution of this commitment.''
   Previous Western news reports from Hanoi have said that the
emigration of 50,000 people, not 500,000, was discussed.
   Details on the working group proposal were not available. The
United States does not extend diplomatic recognition to Vietnam and
has resisted Vietnamese attempts to establish official contact.
Washington says it won't consider relations until Vietnam pulls its
more than 100,000 troops from Cambodia.
   After the talks in Hanoi, the Vietnam News Agency released the
text of a joint communique that suggested an agreement had been
reached.
   The communique said Vietnam was allowing the former detainees to
leave after the U.S. government gave assurances it won't encourage
them to engage in anti-Vietnam activities. It said both sides hoped
that processing of the former detainees can begin within the next
several months. It said they discussed ways to expedite
applications.
   The talks were conducted by teams led by Vietnam's Deputy
Foreign Minister Tran Quang Co and Robert L. Funseth, senior deputy
assistant secretary of state for refugee programs.
   The United States first offered to resettle the former prisoners
in 1984. U.S. interest was renewed after Vietnam's new leadership
freed hundreds of former South Vietnam officials in 1987 and this
year.
   The North Vietnamese established the camps, which usually
combined manual labor with ideological study, after defeating
U.S.-backed South Vietnam in 1975. The U.S. State Department
estimates that 900,000 former U.S. government employees or South
Vietnam officials have spent time in the camps.

   Civil rights activist and City Councilman Hosea
Williams was arrested at City Hall today on a weapons possession
indictment from neighboring Clayton County.
   Stanley Tuggle, chief of administrative operations for the
Clayton County Sheriff's Department, said Williams was arrested by
sheriff's officers who went to Atlanta after Williams held a news
conference to deny he had been notified of the charges.
   Williams was taken away in handcuffs.
   At the news conference about two hours before his arrest,
Williams said he never was notified about the indictment and denied
reports that he had promised to surrender over the weekend.
   ``The racist white press of Atlanta is again out to destroy my
image as a black leader who is unbought and unbossed,'' he said.
   Tuggle was quoted over the weekend as saying: ``We have been in
contact with Mr. Williams and he has indicated he will turn himself
in.''
   The indictment stems from an incident at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport in March.
   Tuggle said today that Clayton County authorities contacted
Williams indirectly last week through the Fulton County Sheriff's
Department and that Williams told those officers he would handle
the matter over the weekend.
   ``He is being truthful when he says he didn't talk directly with
us, but he's not being truthful when he says he didn't know
anything about it,'' Tuggle said.
   Williams was stopped March 6 at a security checkpoint at the
airport as he tried to board a plane. Police said they found a
.38-caliber handgun and five bullets in his briefcase.
   The civil rights activist told reporters he placed the gun in
his briefcase while cleaning his car and forgot it was there when
he dashed to the airport.
   Williams was given a copy of the charges and was allowed to
board the plane after the pistol and bullets were confiscated.
   He initially was charged with two misdemeanor counts of carrying
a weapon without a license and carrying a concealed weapon. The
charge was upgraded to a single felony count after a review of
Williams' criminal record, according to Tuggle.
   Williams was arrested numerous times during his work for civil
rights, but also has faced a string of traffic-related charges.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Against Dance Ban</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ruled
unconstitutional the school dance ban that has been in effect in
tiny Prudy for at least a century.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark stopped short, however, of
ordering the school board to hold dances for students.
   ``It would be inappropriate for this court to order the district
to sponsor school dances. However, a district rule prohibiting
students from holding dances on school property infringes on the
First Amendment rights of the students and must be invalidated,''
Clark said in the decision that followed four days of testimony in
June.
   He awarded the plaintiffs _ 21 students and their parents _ $1
in nominal damages and attorney fees and ordered the school board
not to enforce its ban on dancing.
   William Fleischaker, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer
from Joplin, who represented those who favored dances, said the
school board could still ban dancing if it could present reasons
other than the written rule and religious reasons. But he said he
felt it would be ``foolish'' of the school board to try to stop
dances on school property.
   Nancy Fox, 16, student body president for the upcoming school
year, said she would try to organize a dance for the start of the
school term next month.
   ``I think the only change will be we'll have some dances and
we'll have some fun. I hope there won't be any bad attitudes,'' she
said after Clark's ruling.
   School officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
The school board lawyer was with a client, and members of the
school board did not answer their telephones.
   Clark said he found the testimony of school board members
``incredible.''
   ``The entire board candidly admits that they followed the will
of the majority, but they were not candid in their opinions of the
religious reasoning of the majority,'' Clark wrote.
   ``This court is skeptical that it heard the complete story
concerning the board members' deliberations of the rule and the
religious significance of the opposition to dancing in Purdy,'' his
order said.
   The pro-dancers sued the school board in 1986, maintaining the
dance ban was inspired by a religious bias against dancing.
   But school board members testified that the community of 900
people southwest of Springfield opposed dancing for a number of
reasons that had little to do with religion, including the belief
that dancing leads to drinking and other discipline problems.
   The school board handbook states simply: ``School dances are not
authorized and school premises shall not be used for purposes of
conducting a dance.''
   Purdy High School proms have been held in neighboring
communities, prompting some parents to complain that their children
were put into danger by being forced to drive 30 miles or more to
dance.
   In recent decades, senior classes have made a ritual of asking
the school to allow a dance and being refused. But the class of
1986 proved more persistent.
   Students that year signed a petition in support of a school
dance to publicize a local chapter of Students Against Drunk
Driving. They asked their parents' help and sought media attention
when they took the request before the school board.
   They were met with resistance organized in local churches _ so
many people were drawn to the meeting at which the ban was
challenged that it had to be moved to the high school gymnasium.
The school board, lobbied by anti-dancing ministers, voted
unanimously to uphold the ban.
   Dance supporters followed with a rally to which they invited
stars of the movie ``Footloose,'' a movie about a fictional Texas
town where dancing was banned. Actors Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer
were unable to attend.

official said Monday.
   Islamic studies will become part of the curriculum up to the
10th grade beginning January, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Minority Buddhist, Hindu and Christian children will be required

   An East German family used a tractor to
crash through a border fence, then scaled a ladder over a second
barrier to reach the West, police said.
   The early morning escape north of this Bavarian city apparently
surprised border guards, who did not shoot, police said. They would
not identify the family, which included a 30-year-old man, his
26-year-old wife and two sons aged 3 and 4. They brought the ladder
with them on the tractor, police said.
   On Sunday, Bavarian police said two East German men escaped to
Bavaria, while a 22-year-old Czech mechanic had reached West
Germany from his native country.

<TEXT>
   A man with paralyzed legs who said he is
``America's No. 1 Stuntman'' carried explosives onto the Brooklyn
Bridge today, lowered himself in his wheelchair and dangled for
more than an hour over the East River, police said.
   He was finally talked down onto a police launch in the river.
   The man, Raymond Mesa, 40, of the Bronx, was charged with
disorderly conduct and unlawful dealing with fireworks, said Sgt.
John Clifford.
   Mesa carried business cards that proclaimed, ``Living on the
edge is my business _ America's No. 1 Stuntman,'' Clifford said.
   Mesa was taken to Beekman-Downtown Hospital Center for
psychiatric observation. He told reporters he performed the stunt
to show that handicapped people can ``do anything.''
   Alerted by the crew of a tugboat, a police harbor unit,
emergency service officers and ambulance personnel rushed to the
landmark 105-year-old bridge, which connects Manhattan and Brooklyn.
   Bomb squad officials were also called after a report the man may
have been carrying a couple of pipe bombs. Mesa was carrying two
bags which contained six super M-80's, each the equivalent of
quarter-stick of dynamite, Clifford said.
   The bridge was reopened when Mesa surrendered, but closed again
briefly later while the police bomb squad checked for explosives
that might have been left on the bridge.

   An overcrowded bus jumped a highway
divider and flipped over on a road in northern Portugal on Monday,
killing 10 people and injuring more than 30 others, police said.
   The bus, carrying about 50 people, appeared to be traveling too
fast, said Torquato Beira Carvalho, a passenger quoted by the
Portuguese news agency Lusa.
   Some of the injured were thrown through the bus windows, while
others were trapped in the wreckage on the highway about nine miles
outside Oporto, the agency said.
   Most of the passengers were construction workers, some of whom
were standing in the aisle when the accident occurred.
   The bus was traveling from this industrial city to Sao Joao de
Madeira, about 20 miles south.

<HEAD>Democrats Propose Renewed Contra Aid if Nicaragua Violates Accord</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with Byrd, Dole, Wright, White House comment.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd said today
he hopes to reach bipartisan agreement this week on a new aid
package for Nicaragua's Contra rebels, but it remained unclear
whether the measure would include new weapons.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., said the matter could come before the Senate by
mid-week, when lawmakers will take up a supplemental money bill, or
late in the week when they begin work on a Pentagon funding measure.
   ``The Democrats have not finalized a plan yet,'' Byrd told
reporters. ``I hope we can reach consensus among Democrats and then
go to the Republican leader and see if we can get bipartisan
agreement.''
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was an
encouraging sign that the Democrats are working on a proposal to
give military aid to the Contras if the Sandinista government does
not honor its peace pledges.
   It ``certainly does seem to signal that the Democrats and others
are concerned about the recent actions of President (Daniel)
Ortega, that they recognize the fact Ortega has turned his back on
the peace process and has started clamping down on all these
various freedoms,'' said Fitzwater.
   He said the administration would work with Democrats and others
``to get an acceptable plan.''
   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., has proposed a $47 million aid
package for the anti-Sandinista rebels, including $20 million in
standby military aid that could be triggered by a later
congressional vote. The package has been endorsed by President
Reagan, for whom the Contras have been a top foreign policy
priority.
   Dole today pronounced himself ``eager to hear what (the
Democrats) have in mind'' and urged Democratic drafters to include
a reliable delivery system in their aid plan.
   While diplomatic negotiations are the key to peace in the
region, Dole said, sustaining the rebels as ``a credible presence
at the bargaining table'' is essential to the success of any talks.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias is at work on a plan to bring
the two sides back together following the breakdown of negotiations
in June.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee and a consistent supporter of the rebel military effort,
said Sunday Democrats are at work on a proposal to give military
aid to the Contras if the leftist Managua government does not honor
the peace pledges it has made.
   ``There's an effort right now going on among Senate Democrats to
come forward with our own proposal,'' Boren said Sunday on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press.''
   ``As I said, one that would be balanced, that would hold out the
stick, the possibility of a resumption of military aid if the
Sandinistas continue to violate the peace pledges they've made.''
   The Washington Post said in Monday's editions that the
Democratic plan calls for a release of $18 million in frozen
military aid to the Contras if the Sandinistas violate provisions
of the regional peace plan reached almost exactly a year ago.
   But prospects for ultimate passage of any new aid remained
clouded. House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said today the House
would wait to see what senators agree on before taking any action.
He added: ``I still tend to doubt there will be votes in the House
to resume the war.''
   The prospects for renewed aid in Congress generally reflect the
increased polarization in the region, where the Sandinistas have
cracked down harshly on opponents and a newly reconstituted Contra
leadership has taken a harder line.
   Boren told the Post the Democratic plan would prohibit further
votes on the Contra-aid issue this year. That would in large part
remove the controversial issue from the presidential campaign.
   Under the proposal being drafted by the Senate Democrats,
according to the Post, $18 million in lethal aid already
appropriated but frozen would be released if the Sandinista
government made an unprovoked attack on the Contras.
   Dole said the $18 million figure did not square with information
he has received from the administration, and that actual residual
weapons stores were less. The exact figure is classified.
   The paper quoted Boren as saying the lethal aid already exists
in warehouses outside the United States. The president would
determine when an unprovoked attack is made.
   Congress voted $100 million in military aid to the Contras in
late 1986 _ $60 million to be delivered beginning in February 1987,
the rest in 1988. Congress froze delivery on Feb. 29 to ensure the
United States did not subvert the regional peace plan signed by all
five Central American presidents, including Ortega.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Backburns and wind ballooned fires in Yellowstone National Park
today, where more than 125,500 acres already have burned, and in
Bighorn National Forest to the east, firefighters worked to control
blazes charring 1,800 acres.
   A timber fire that burned 3,840 acres over six days in the Black
Hills on the edge of Rapid City, S.D., was declared controlled
Sunday night. A fire is considered controlled when it is reduced to
smoldering patches.
   Crews used hand tools and turned over logs to crush out the last
embers of that arson-suspected blaze.
   Fires burned still in Idaho, Utah, Washington state and Montana.
   In Yellowstone, fires that forced the closure of some areas of
the park last week began to calm over the weekend, leaving
firefighters battling only two, the 11,600-acre Fan fire in the
park's northwestern corner and the North Fork fire west of Old
Faithful.
   But on Sunday, high wind combined with backburning intended to
stop the blazes fanned the North Fork fire from 11,300 acres to
18,200 in 24 hours, said Earl LaOrange, a fire information officer.
   Today about 360 firefighters were sent back to re-establish the
lines along the southern and eastern edges of the fire, said fire
information officer Larry Blade.
   Also jumping substantially in size was the Fan Fire, which grew
from 7,500 acres to 11,600, said LaOrange.
   Areas of the park closed by the fires, including the park's
south entrance closed by the 12,000-acre Shoshone fire and the
11,400-acre Red fire, re-opened Sunday, although the road from the
park's south entrance was closed periodically throughout the day.
   But in the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming, officials were
hampered by winds and were expecting manpower problems as they
tried to control an estimated 1,800-acre fire.
   In Idaho, cooler weather helped firefighters today near
containment on the 5,000-acre Willis Gulch Fire in the Boise
National Forest, and crews using hand tools battled another
west-central Idaho blaze still growing in rugged, remote terrain
near Cascade.
   About 90 percent of the Willis Gulch fire's 10-mile perimeter
was surrounded by cleared fire lines early today.
   ``It's coming along really well,'' Forest Service spokeswoman
Jean Hawthorne said. ``The weather is cooperating a lot. It's a lot
cooler.''
   More than 1,150 people were committed to the 7-day-old blaze
about 35 miles northeast of Boise in a drive to contain it by
tonight. The fire has destroyed $7.5 million worth of timber and
other resources and cost over $1 million to fight so far.
   Priority was being shifted to the 3-day-old Riordan Lake fire,
also in the Boise National Forest, Ms. Hawthorne said. The
lightning-caused blaze had consumed 110 acres by early today.
   Cooler weather also gave Washington state firefighters help in
containing two fires burning in old-growth trees and felled timber
in the Cascade Mountains, while a fire line was established around
a 55-acre blaze on the Olympic Peninsula despite high wind.
   Containment of the 3,600-acre Falls Creek fire along the crest
of the Cascades, originally predicted for Sunday evening, was
expected by tonightm said Barbara Kennedy, a Forest Service
spokeswoman.
   A crew battling a 400-acre fire in the northern Utah desert
expected to contain that later today, said Interagency Fire Center
dispatcher Bill Brooks.
   Crews fought the stubborn Rock Creek fire in southwestern
Montana, and a camper was in custody on suspicion of leaving an
unattended fire that started the fire on July 22. The fire had
expanded to 3,150 acres by Sunday night, and was expected to be
contained by Tuesday, said spokeswoman Jo Barnier.

   A Hungarian daily on Monday deplored a
shortage of newsprint that is forcing publications to limit the
size of some newspapers at a time of increased political openness
and interest in the press.
   ``This is a sad state of affairs,'' the Magyar Nemzet daily
commented in an editorial, saying it would be cutting the paper's
size four times a week.
   It said the shortages resulted from foreign partners _ ``mainly
the Soviet Union'' _ being unable to meet their exports.
   The newspaper deplored that ``at a time when the country's
political developments have reached a point where ... more
openness, straightforward words and sincerity are needed, when the
news is a necessity like bread, ... the newsprint situation of the
country should have become catastrophic.''
   Magyar Nemzet has been testing the limits of Hungary's new
openness, interviewing dissidents and reporting on sensitive issues
such as environmental problems and relations with Romania.
   Magyar Nemzet has a circulation of 97,000 copies daily. The
Communist Party daily Nepszabdsag has a circulation of 700,000.
Hungary has a population of 10.5 million.

<HEAD>U.N. Team Reports Iraq Using Mustard And Nerve Gas</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to update with Iranian comment. Picks up
4th graf pvs ``The U.N. inquiry ...'' </NOTE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is continuing to use mustard and
nerve gas ``on an intensive scale'' in its eight-year war with Iran
despite frequent pleas that it cease, according to a report by a
team of U.N. experts released today.
   ``The secretary-general cannot but express his deep regret at
the mission's conclusion that chemical weapons continue to be used
against Iranian forces and positions,'' U.N. chief Javier Perez de
Cuellar said in a statement.
   There was no immediate reaction from Iraq and the Iraqi Mission
said officials were not available. Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of
Iraq, in New York for U.N. talks on ending the Iran-Iraq war, last
month acknowledged that Iraqi soldiers used chemical weapons.
   Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati of Iran said today that
the report ``only refers to allegations against Iran, only cites
nine soldiers.''
   He added he hoped the report ``will only further motivate the
Security Council to exert all pressure and leverage against Iraq to
accept a cease-fire and comprehensive settlement.''
   The secretary-general is conducting talks with both sides on
ending their war and implementing a cease-fire.
   The U.N. inquiry was requested by Iran, which charged that Iraq
had used the weapons frequently and on a massive scale, killing
thousands of people in the spring. At Iraq's request, the team
later went to Baghdad.
   The team said it examined Iraqi soldiers who had been injured by
mustard gas, but did not conclude that Iran used chemical weapons.
   Earlier U.N. reports also have documented use of the weapons by
Iraq and the Baghdad government has admitted using chemical
weapons. Iranian officials had denied using the weapons.
   ``The danger of continuing escalation involving the use of those
weapons of mass destruction, in violation of the Geneva Protocol
and in spite of repeated findings ... and numerous appeals, is a
frightening possibility which must be fully faced by all concerned
and the international community as a whole,'' the
secretary-general's statement said.
   In May the Security Council condemned the increasing use of
chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and urged restraint by both
sides.
   ``We deeply regret to say that ... in spite of repeated appeals
by the United Nations, chemical weapons continue to be used on an
intensive scale against Iranian forces,'' the report by chemical
warfare specialists said.
   The 53-page report consists of two parts based on visits to both
Iran and Iraq at the requests of the two government.
   It said clinical examinations of nine Iraqi soldiers showed
their injuries had been produced by mustard gas. The Iraqis
displayed mortar grenades that showed evidence of mustard gas and
said they had been used by the Iranians, the team said.
   The section on Iraq's use of the weapons is more detailed,
involving more patients and locations and studies of chemical bomb
fragments. The report describes numerous injuries caused by mustard
gas, but said the investigators could not confirm reports of nerve
gas use because it disappears quickly.
   The medical chief and others in an Iranian war zone told the
investigators that because it dissipates quickly and allows
attackers to advance, the nerve gas was used against front line
troops. They said mustard gas was used against rear areas to
disrupt possible counterattacks because of its lasting effects.
   The team visited Iran from July 1 to 5, went to hospitals in
Bakhtaran and Ahvas and traveled to the war zone in the southwest.
It visited Iraq on July 10 and 11 and visited hospitals in As
Sulaymaniyah and Baghdad.
   The team consisted of two chemical weapons specialists, Dr. Erik
Dahlgren of the Swedish Defense Research Institute in Umea, Sweden,
and Dr. Manuel Dominguez Carmona of Universidad Complutense de
Madrid in Spain. They were accompanied by a U.N. Secretariat
official.

   A man awaiting sentencing for kidnapping
and raping a youngster has been charged with abducting two boys,
molesting one, and trying to abduct a girl during a 24-hour spree
through two states.
   Richard E. Gardner, 21, of Weymouth, Mass., had been free on
$3,000 bail while awaiting sentencing for the rape and kidnapping
of a boy in Hingham, Mass., said Rhode Island Attorney General
James O'Neil.
   ``I think this well demonstrates the need for bail reform,''
O'Neil said at a press conference Sunday.
   Gardner's mother, Sylvia, said he had received psychiatric
treatment as an outpatient and had gone to a counseling session
Thursday.
   ``There was no indication that anything was wrong,'' she said.
   Gardner was arrested Saturday night shortly after a 6-year-old
boy was returned to his home here. The boy had been pushed into a
stranger's car Friday evening while walking home from a library
with his older brother and a friend.
   Gardner was being held at the Adult Correctional Institutions in
Cranston. He was ordered held without bail at arraignment today in
Kent County District Court on charges including two counts of
kidnapping, burglary, child molestation, assault with a dangerous
weapon, possession of a stolen vehicle, reckless driving and
eluding arrest, said Detective Capt. Roger Burlingame. No plea was
entered, said Cmdr. John J. Mulhearn.
   The spree began early Friday when a man broke into a Warwick
house, pointed a flashlight in the eyes of a sleeping 10-year-old
boy, and forced the boy at knifepoint to leave with him, Burlingame
said. The boy's parents were sleeping. The child was molested and
then released to find his way home, Burlingame said.
   Later Friday, a man tried to abduct an 11-year-old girl in
Bellingham, Mass., police said. He grabbed the girl by the arm, but
she broke free, and he drove off.
   The man returned to Rhode Island, pulling the 6-year-old off the
sidewalk two blocks from his home, police said.
   That abduction triggered a search of the Warwick area by about
125 local, state and federal authorities, aided by civilian groups.
When the boy was returned, police chased the suspect who fled by
car and then on foot.
   Burlingame said all three children have identified Gardner. The
detective also said police in several other communities are
interested in questioning Gardner in connection with abductions
within the last six weeks.
   In the Hingham case, Gardner pleaded guilty June 2 to abducting
a 12-year-old boy in November 1987, tying him to a tree in a state
park and molesting him.
   Mrs. Gardner, who lives in Weymouth, said her son was ``a
confused child who was raped when he was 12.''
   Steve Hudson, 17, who lives near the Gardners in the
middle-class neighborhood near downtown Boston, called Gardner ``an
introverted person.''
   ``He always hung around by himself. He never had any friends his
own age, never any girlfriends or anything like that. No one his
own age ever went near him,'' Hudson said. ``He was like a social
outcast.''

   A witness said Monday hundreds of
people were standing on a section of ferry pier when it collapsed
onto a ramp packed with cars and motorcycles, killing at least 31
people and injuring more than 800.
   Cheong Ah Chye, 21, was one of thousands waiting to board the
ferry Sunday evening to attend a Chinese religious festival on
Penang Island, about three miles away, and said he was only about a
yard from the section that collapsed.
   The ferry has an upper deck for passengers and a lower level for
cars, trucks and motorcycles.
   S. Naga Rajan, a journalist for the daily Star of Penang, said
he had stepped onto the ferry only seconds before the disaster. He
said hundreds of people had jammed the boarding area of the pier,
justling and clambering over barriers.
   Rajan said: ``I had just stepped onto the ferry when I heard a
loud noise. I turned around and saw that the portion from the
beginning of the pathway to the ferry and the area around the
sliding gate had fallen.
   ``I rushed down to the vehicle section of the ferry and saw that
the whole platform around the area _ iron beams, planks and wires _
had collapsed with the people on it. It fell on vehicles on the
lower floor going into the ferry.
   ``Then I saw people, bleeding in the head, face, arms and legs
emerging from the debris. Many were covered with dirt and all were
in shock.
   ``Some mothers, their faces bleeding, were looking for their
children. Some people were crying, others offered prayers. A number
of people were trapped under the iron beams and debris. Soon police
and firemen arrived to pull them out.''
   Mohamed Noorani Kamarun, deputy secretary of Penang state and
head of the rescue operation, told reporters Monday that earlier
reports of 35 dead were wrong. He said 31 people had been killed,
including 13 who died in hospitals.
   He said only three of the casualties had been found to be
foreigners: two from Singapore and a French tourist with minor
injuries.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad flew to Butterworth from Kuala
Lumpur, the capital city 180 miles to the southeast, and visited
the injured at a government hospital.
   Mahathir said an immediate payment of about $800 would be made
to the family of each of the dead and other compensation might be
provided.
   Rescue officials said most of the debris had been cleared away
and no more bodies or survivors were expected to be found.
   Butterworth has two ferry piers. The one remaining intact
resumed operation Monday after a safety inspection.
   Only passengers were allowed on the pier. Vehicles were ordered
to use the bridge that links this port of 50,000 people to Penang
Island across the Strait of Malacca.
   The rescue center said all but two of the dead had been
indentified and the total number injured was 863, including 417
still hospitalized.

   Detroit voters are being asked Tuesday whether they want to bet
on casino gambling as a ticket to prosperity, while Missourians
decide whether to bail out their state lottery by enriching the
jackpot.
   In other primary voting in three states, two Republican
ex-congressmen compete for the right to challenge Michigan's
liberal Democratic Sen. Donald Riegle, and a former Missouri first
lady, Betty Hearnes, bids for a chance to become that state's first
woman governor.
   Kansas also has primaries, with contests in three of five
congressional districts. The only incumbent challenged in a primary
is GOP Rep. Jan Meyers, who is seeking a third term in the 3rd
District. She is favored over Charles B. ``Bat'' Masterson, 73, a
retired school administrator.
   Two well-known names appear on Missouri primary ballots.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt filed at the last minute for a seventh
term after dropping his presidential bid. Most of the Democrats who
had entered the 3rd District race then withdrew, but three
little-known contenders remained on the ballot.
   And in the 8th District, farm activist Wayne Cryts, who gained
national attention in 1981 taking soybeans out of a padlocked,
bankrupt grain elevator, will seek the Democratic nomination to
oppose Republican Rep. Bill Emerson. Cryts lost to Emerson by 8,000
out of 150,000 votes cast in 1986.
   Missouri's 2{-year-old lottery suffered a $24 million drop in
sales during the last fiscal year, and officials are blaming
restrictions specifying that exactly 45 percent of lottery proceeds
go for prizes and 10 percent for administrative costs, including
advertising.
   A measure on the ballot would amend the rules, making prize
money a minimum of 45 percent of proceeds and allowing the state to
spend more on advertising. Proponents say that would make the
lottery more appealing and increase sales.
   Mrs. Hearnes, a 61-year-old state representative whose husband
Warren was governor from 1965 to 1973, is hoping to unseat
Republican Gov. John Ashcroft. She has Democratic opposition only
from Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed, a St. Louis area teacher.
   In Michigan, both Jim Dunn and Robert Huber have sought to make
Riegle's liberalism the issue, saying he's out of tune with voters.
But the 50-year-old incumbent says he's happy to defend a voting
record that brought him a 100 percent score in a recent survey by
Americans for Democratic Action.
   Riegle, Michigan's senior senator, has $4 million in campaign
funds and faces no opposition in the Democratic primary as he seeks
a third term. He also emphasizes that he's expected to become
chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
Committee if he is re-elected.
   Huber, 65, has portrayed himself as a staunch Reagan Republican,
in favor of preserving federal income tax cuts, a strong defense,
using more federal muscle in the war on drugs, and opposing
abortion.
   Dunn, 44, holds more moderate views. During his term in
Congress, 1981-82, he supported most of Reagan's tax cut and budget
reduction policies, but often opposed the administration on social
issues and cuts in college aid.
   AIDS became an issue in the race last week when Dunn said in a
radio interview that he took ``a reasonable, rational, I think very
responsible approach to the problems that face this nation. Mr.
Huber has said that the reason people have AIDS is the wrath of
God, punishment from God'' of homosexuals and drug users.
   Huber, asked about Dunn's remarks, said ``I don't know whether
it's the wrath of God, but if it isn't it should be.''
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young's dream of bringing a string of
glittering hotel-casinos to an island in the Detroit River is
showing up on the ballot for the third time in 12 years. Opponents
sponsored an intiative urging voters to go on record opposing the
idea, which has been voted down both previous times.
   Young has been pushing casinos as a way to bring jobs and
tourism to a city with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate, but he
acknowledges the advisory vote is likely to fail. ``If we win, it
will be the upset of all upsets,'' he said.
   Gambling can be legalized only with approval of the Legislature.

   The Iranian government replied officially to a
U.S. suggestion of working toward improved relations, but imposed
unacceptable conditions for such a move, a White House spokesman
said today.
   Marlin Fitzwater said the message repeated demands the Iranians
have publicly made, particularly the release of their assets held
by U.S. financial institutions.
   ``I'd say that it didn't offer any new information,'' the
spokesman told reporters at the daily White House news briefing.
   ``We have received a response to our earlier message, and the
thrust of it was that they said the same thing in private that they
had been saying in public,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said this included an insistence by Iran the United
States must release Iranian assets frozen in this country, to
demonstrate America's interest in warming relations with the
revolutionary government of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the Iranian
message came in late Friday through a ``third party.'' The U.S.
official said ``there was nothing new in it beyond what has been
said publicly.''
   She decined to provide any details. ``I`m not offering any
further characterization of it. We simply said that we had sent a
message. We had a response.''
   Asked if the United States had replied to Iran, the spokeswoman
said: ``No.''
   Fitzwater said that the communication from Iran contained a
``quid pro quo,'' adding that deal-making with Tehran is
``something we have said we won't do.''
   The spokesman had said repeatedly last week that the United
States received no response from Iran to a letter that the
administration sent congratulating Tehran on its acceptance of U.N.
Security Council Resolution 598, seeking a ceasefire to the
Iran-Iraq war and expressing an interest in an improvement of
relations.
   He also said at the time that the United States would deal only
with an ``authoritative'' representative of the ayatollah's
government.
   The spokesman refused today to identify the source of the
communication, although he said that it had been accepted by the
administration as official and genuine.
   ``We considered it a serious response,'' Fitzwater said. ``(But)
I don't think we're willing to give it any signficance.''
   U.S. officials had privately confirmed two weeks ago that the
main U.S. feeler directed toward Tehran had been sent through the
auspices of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. A
delegation of high-ranking Iranian officials has been at the United
Nations to discuss implementation of the ceasefire resolution.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz had said Sunday that he
would be willing to meet with his Iranian counterpart if there were
interest in such a session.
   But U.S. officials have steadfastly ruled out negotiating with
the Iranians to gain the release of nine Americans held hostage by
pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Government Confirms Arrest of Dissidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Burma announced
Monday it had detained 10 people, including the country's most
outspoken dissident, to protect itself from attack.
   The announcement came less than a week after new leader Sein
Lwin, a hardline former general known for ruthless suppression of
dissent, came to power. He replaced Ne Win who ruled Burma for 26
years.
   Official Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, said action would
be taken against prominent dissident Aung Gyi and nine other
detainees ``according to criminal law procedures.''
   ``In order to prevent an attack against the state, as
preventative measures, authorities concerned detained Aung Gyi and
his associates ... as from July 29, 1988,'' the broadcast said.
   It was the first official word of the arrests, which had been
reported last week by Western diplomats in Rangoon, Burma's
capital, and the U.S. State Department.
   The radio did not mention the fate of Associated Press
correspondent Sein Win and others the diplomats said also were
detained.
   Those listed by the radio mostly were retired military officers,
many of whom supported Ne Win during his early years in power. Most
are in their mid- to late 60s.
   Aung Gyi, 70, emerged this year as the most outspoken critic of
Burma's authoritarian regime through a series of letters decrying
economic and political conditions in the country.
   He singled out new leader Sein Lwin for ``turning a blind eye''
to gross human rights abuses during bloody student riots in March
in which more than 100 people are believed to have been killed.
   Sein Lwin, chief of the ruling Burma Socialist Program party and
the country's president, is widely believed to have commanded the
troops that suppressed the student riots.
   Aung Gyi, giving gruesome details of rapes and beatings, claimed
that 283 people died.
   A private businessman, Aung Gyi was once allied with Ne Win and
was regarded as his possible successor. But the two disagreed over
economic policy and the more pragmatic, liberal Aung Gyi resigned
from the government in 1963. He was subsequently jailed.
   The state radio broadcast identified the other detainees as Kyi
Han, Tun Win, Ba Shwe, Khin Nyo, Kyi Maung, Tun Shwe, Chit Ko Ko,
Aung Win and Zaw Win.
   Retired colonels Kyi Muang and Khin Nyo were in Ne Win's
Revolutionary Council after he seized power in 1962. Kyi Maung left
Ne Win's government in 1963 and Khin Nyo was fired in 1965.
   Han Kyi has once served as military attache in Washington and as
ambassador to Manila. Ba Shwe is an ex-ambassador to India.
   Diplomatic sources said that Aung Shwe, a former general who
once served as ambassador to Australia, also was held.
   Rangoon was reported quiet Monday, but leaflets circulated by
student groups called for a nationwide anti-government strike Aug.
8, Western diplomatic sources said.
   The sources, who asked not to be further identified, said some
of the leaflets came from the All Burma Universities Students
Democratic League, which has demanded the removal of Sein Lwin and
the release of student detainees.
   Virtually all the country's academic institutions were closed
after the last student riots in June. They are scheduled to reopen
in mid-August.
   The U.S. Embassy in Burma, meanwhile, reportedly made an
official inquiry Monday into the status of AP correspondent Sein
Win, who diplomats said was being held with the others at Insein
prison on the outskirts of Rangoon.
   Sein Win, 66, once a publisher of the English-language newspaper
The Guardian, was awarded the Golden Pen of Freedom by the
Paris-based International Federation of Journalists in 1963 for his
work in fostering a free press in Burma. He was jailed for three
years in the 1960s along with thousands of other political
prisoners.

   A prosecutor told jurors today the case
involving a Lutheran minister and a free-lance journalist is not
about the sanctuary movement or freedom of the press.
   Instead, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Rhonda Backinoff, it is a
case involving the exploitation of two pregnant Salvadoran women
who came to the United States seeking a better life. The issues of
sanctuary or the First Amendment were only smokescreens raised by
the defendants to protect themselves, she said.
   Ms. Backinoff outlined the prosection's evidence today as she
presented her final arguments. Defense attorneys were to give
closing statements later today.
   ``Why the defendants did what they did is really not an issue
here,'' she said. ``The bottom line is the immigration law was
avoided.''
   U.S. District Judge John Conway on Friday denied defense motions
to dismiss the case against the Rev. Glen Remer-Thamert, 44, and
Demetria Martinez, 28.
   Ms. Martinez faces one count of conspiracy to violate
immigration laws and one count each of transporting and inducing
Ines Campos-Anzora and Cecelia Elias-Alegria to enter the United
States. Remer-Thamert faces one count of conspiracy and two counts
each of transporting, harboring and inducing the women to enter the
United States.
   Ms. Backinoff told the jurors that Remer-Thamert and Ms.
Martinez conspired to bring the women into the United States
illegally in August 1986.
   She said Remer-Thamert bought the women's tickets to Chihuahua,
Mexico, by airplane and to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, by train. She
said both Remer-Thamert and Ms. Martinez met them in Juarez and
both were present when Remer-Thamert arranged for the women to be
taken illegally into El Paso, Texas.
   Ms. Backinoff also said both defendants were present on the trip
by car from El Paso to Albuquerque.
   Remer-Thamert has testified he believed former Gov. Toney
Anaya's proclamation declaring New Mexico a sanctuary state would
allow him to bring the women into the country without visas.
   The prosecutor said Ms. Martinez never wrote about the case.
   Ms. Martinez, who writes religion articles for the Albuquerque
Journal and other publications, has said she was present as a
reporter. She said she never wrote about the women because she
began to fear that could jeopardize the safety of the women or of
their families in El Salvador.
   Ms. Backinoff said the women were used as props by the
defendants to support their own beliefs about Central America.
   She also said the defendants never intended for the women to
remain in the United States. She said a contract between the women
and a Salvadoran attorney called for them to give up their children
for adoption and return to El Salvador.

<HEAD>South Korea Proposes Contacts With North to Ease Tension</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Korea on Monday proposed
preliminary contacts with North Korea to set up a joint
parliamentary session that would draft a non-aggression pact and
other tension-easing measures.
   National Assembly speaker Kim Chae-sun said in a letter
addressed to his North Korean counterpart, Yang Hyung-sup, that the
working talks be held next week in Panmunjom, a border village
about 35 miles north of Seoul.
   Also on Monday, radical students tried unsuccessfully to deliver
another letter to North Korea as part of their plan to march to the
border Aug. 15 for separate talks with northern students on
national unification.
   In his letter, sent to North Korea through Panmunjom, Kim said:
``We hope you will respond affirmatively to our proposal for
holding representatives' talks as soon as possible.'' North Korea
has not responded.
   The South Korean letter came after two North Korean proposals
last month calling for a joint session of the two countries'
legislatures to draft a non-aggression pact and to discuss North
Korea's possible participation in the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympic Games
in Seoul.
   In a letter delivered July 21, North Korea proposed that the
parliaments hold the joint session by the end of this month. In a
second letter, sent five days later, North Korea said the joint
session should also discuss Pyongyang's bid to be a co-host of the
Olympics.
   North Korea suggested that both sides skip the working sessions
and convene a full parliamentary session in the capital of
Pyongyang, but Seoul officials said preliminary talks are needed to
set an agenda and discuss other details.
   South Korean officials said North Korea's demand to be a co-host
of the Olympics could be a stumbling block, but said they want to
open contact.
   Officials in Seoul, who have expressed concern that North Korea
might resort to terrorism to disrupt the Olympics, said privately
that resumption of contacts between the two sides would help ensure
the safety of the Olympics.
   North Korea has said it would boycott the Olympics unless it is
allowed to be a co-host. The International Olympic Committee has
rejected the North Korean demand, saying the Olympics are awarded
to one city and cannot be shared.
   An unknown number of students left Seoul on Monday for Panmunjom
to deliver a letter to their North Korean counterparts concerning
the proposed Aug. 15 talks.
   A spokesman for the group said in Seoul the students were
determined to deliver the letter in the village, which is
off-limits to civilians.
   Authorities deployed about 2,000 police around bus and train
stations on the Seoul-Panmunjom route and checked travelers going
to the border area. No arrests were made.
   An attempt by students to march to the border June 10 also was
blocked by police.
   Communist North Korea and South Korea have remained bitter
rivals since the country was partitioned by the United States and
the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. The division was
followed by the Korean War of 1950-53.

   The Jordanian monarch made it clear he was giving up his claim
to the West Bank, which his grandfather King Abdullah annexed in
1950 and which he lost to Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In deference to Arab and Palestinian demands, he said, Jordan
would dissolve ``legal and administrative links'' to Palestinians
in the occupied territories.
   That remark prompted widespread concern among Palestinians, much
of it voiced privately, about how far Hussein will go in breaking
his ties with Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   Jordanian influence is pervasive. Jordanian dinars are the main
currency in the West Bank, Jordanian law is used in the courts, and
Jordanian textbooks are used in the schools.
   More importantly, nearly 1 million Palestinians from the West
Bank and Jerusalem carry Jordanian passports and the king
distributes about $70 million to $100 million a year in salaries,
scholarships and stipends.
   Diplomatic observers believe Hussein will be cautious in
carrying out such steps so as not to stir unrest among Palestinians
who account for about two-thirds of Jordan's 2.4 million population.
   But many Palestinians fear Hussein may limit the validity of
passports or refuse to issue new ones. He also has the power to
restrict visits across the Jordan River bridges.
   Jordan can delay, reduce or cancel altogether stipends paid to
13,000 teachers, lawyers, ex-Jordanian government workers and
officials of Islamic institutions.
   The expectation was that Hussein would gradually introduce new
measures defining Jordan's new relationship with Palestinians in
the occupied territories. Hussein supporters warned the change
would be dramatic.
   ``Nobody appreciates the magnitude of what is happening,'' said
Othman Hallak, editor of the pro-Jordan Arabic daily An Nahar
newspaper in Jerusalem.
   He said there were serious questions about whether Israel would
allow the PLO to take over Jordan's behind-the-scenes role in
supporting agriculture, education and Moslem charities.
   It was even more doubtful whether Israel was willing to engage
in any form of dialogue with the PLO.
   Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat is viewed
by both major Israeli political blocs as an unacceptable partner
for negotiations because of his reliance on terrorism and the PLO's
commitment to destroying the Jewish state.
   Peres, the head of the left-of-center Labor Party, invested a
great deal of credibility in promoting Hussein as a stand-in
negotiator for the PLO.
   Hussein's spurning of a leading role was therefore a serious
embarrassment for Peres, who already is trailing right-wing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir in polls conducted in advance of Israel's
Nov. 1 election.
   Peres had dueled repeatedly with Shamir in public over the need
for an international conference on Middle East peace. Peres said
such a conference would give Hussein a cover to talk directly to
Israel about the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, something
the monarch could not do otherwise.
   Peres said he worked out a framework for negotiations with
Hussein at an April 11, 1987, meeting in London. He said the
monarch agreed that Palestinians negotiators in a joint delegation
with Jordan would not be affiliated with the PLO.
   Israeli officials, especially those close to Peres, have sought
to play down the importance of Hussein's measures. They argued that
the moves were tactical and Hussein was waiting to be called on for
help if the PLO was unable to meet the challenge.
   ``It is a signal to the (Palestinian) inhabitants of the
territories not to forget who they depend on,'' said Ephraim Sneh,
a former West Bank military governor who belongs to the Labor Party.
   He predicted Hussein would resume a more active role after the
Israeli and U.S. elections in November.
   Israeli officials also stressed there has been little tangible
impact from the two concrete steps Hussein has taken: dissolving
parliament or halting a five-year development program that came
nowhere near raising a promised $1.3 billion.
   But the 60-member lower house of parliament, which included 30
West Bankers, and the development scheme were symbols, started when
Hussein wanted to signal his desire to broaden Jordan's influence
and take an active role in peace negotiations.
   In his televised speech Sunday night, Hussein said he would
continue to play a role in peace efforts but made it clear that his
position would be more in tune with the policies of other Arab
states and the PLO.
   To underscore commitment to Arab unity for West Bankers who are
able to view Jordan television, Hussein sat in front of a large
portrait of Emir Hussein Bin Aly, his great-grandfather and the
first modern leader to mobilize pan-Arab forces for a 1916 revolt
against Ottoman Turkey.
   ``Jordan will play a role as an Arab country and a confrontation
state, but the role of representing the Palestinians falls to the
PLO,'' said Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO daily Al Fajr.

   It's an age-old remedy for a 5-year-old with
behavior problems: Pack him up and ship him off to boarding school.
Maybe he'll monkey around less _ or more.
   That's what the Dallas Zoo did in 1987 with Kanda, a lowland
gorilla who was having trouble after his mother died while giving
birth to him.
   Kanda was shipped off to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado
Springs, Colo., to learn how to act more like a gorilla, instead of
aping the humans who had been hand-raising him.
   Reports from Colorado, where Kanda lives with three other
gorillas, are encouraging, Dallas primate keeper Luther Punch said
Sunday.
   ``He integrated into that group especially well,'' said Karen
Murray, marketing and development director for the Colorado zoo.
``He used to walk up on his legs. Now he is not doing it as
frequently.''
   But Kanda won't be coming home on holiday soon. Colorado
officials expect to keep him until he reaches maturity at age 10.

   Five years ago, a boy
vacationing with his family on an island near Nassau stuffed a note
into a champagne bottle and dropped it in the Atlantic Ocean.
   Last week, Nick Biddle got a reply to his message, from a
60-year-old Briton who found the broken bottle on a beach in
southern Wales.
   Nick's bottle had had his name and address inside and this
message for the finder: ``Please, when you find this, could you
write me back?''
   Alan Bennett was vacationing near The Mumbles, a coastal town in
southern Wales about 60 miles west of Bristol, England, when he
found the bottle. In a straight line, that's a distance of more
than 4,400 miles.
   ``I was very surprised to find the bottle had traveled such a
long way,'' the retired British Airways employee said in a
telephone interview Sunday. ``I thought the least that I could do
was write this gentleman back.''
   ``Dear Sir (Nick),'' his letter began. ``Whilst walking on the
beach one morning, I saw in a rock pool an old champagne bottle
which, I imagine, must have been five or six years old judging by
the marine growth it had collected.
   ``I can only assume that it was possibly a young boy's treasure
bottle, so I am writing to let you know it has been found after all
this time even though sadly it had to be broken.
   ``Yours truly, A. Bennett.''
   Nick, now 10, said he never forgot about the bottle and was
thrilled to get a response.
   ``I always had it on my mind, but when I heard about the letter,
I got really excited,'' said Nick, a fifth-grader at Gulf Beaches
Elementary School.
   Nick plans to write back to his new pen pal, who lives in the
Welsh town of Treharris.

<TEXT>
   NASA detected a new liquid hydrogen
leak Monday as it put space shuttle Discovery through a fullscale
countdown rehearsal, and officials said the problem could further
delay a crucial engine test firing beyond Thursday.
   Had the leak been found during an actual count, the launch would
have been scrubbed. But because it was a test, the launch director
bypassed the problem to gather as much data and experience as
possible from the first such rehearsal since the Challenger
disaster 2{ years ago.
   ``The launch team did a superb job on the wet countdown
demonstration test and accomplished most of the objectives,'' said
Robert Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations.
   Objectives missed during the ``wet'' test, in which the liquid
propellants were pumped to the shuttle's tanks, will be sought
during a second countdown leading to the 20-second firing of
Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said a firm schedule for the
test-firing would not be set until at least Tuesday, after
technicians have had a chance to trace the source of the latest
leak, in a launch pad service mast.
   The firing already has been delayed four times by various
problems, including another hydrogen leak in the same service mast
last Friday.
   The test is considered mandatory before Discovery is certified
ready for the first shuttle flight since the loss of Challenger and
its crew of seven in an explosion shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28,
1986.
   Officials believe the practice countdown delays, combined with
an unresolved leak in the spaceship's steering thruster system,
could push the launch date back from mid-September into October.
   The new leak halted fueling of the shuttle's liquid hydrogen
tank early Monday after it had been loaded with 254,000 gallons, 67
percent of capacity.
   Launch director Sieck assessed the situation and ordered the
clock to continue to obtain data on other aspects of the count. A
full load of 143,000 gallons was pumped into the liquid oxygen tank.
   The clock was stopped as planned by a simulated problem at 11
seconds before a mock liftoff, and the launch team practiced steps
it would take to recover from a postponement _ making the shuttle
safe, draining the propellants and getting the vehicle ready for
another countdown and launch attempt.
   The second countdown is to end with the engine test firing, with
Discovery bolted to the pad.
   The purpose of the dual countdown test is to check modifications
made to the engines and launch pad since the Challenger accident
and to give the launch team practice.
   When the firing is completed, NASA still must cope with the
small gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from
Discovery's main engines.
   Engineers have a plan to reach the leak by cutting a hole
through the rear bulkhead of the shuttle's cargo bay.
   Another option, with a decision to be made after the
test-firing, is to take Discovery off the pad and back to a hangar
for repair, a move that could postpone the launch until November.

   A man found guilty of forcing his wife to

because the law on marital rape went into effect after his arrest.
   Michael Ray Engfors, 34, was convicted Friday of felony menacing
and possession of a weapon by a previous offender. The Pitkin
County District Court jury said it had to clear Engfors of
first-degree sexual assault because the law making it illegal for a

   The Engfors had already filed for divorce, and Kim Engfors said
her husband, carrying a knife, went into her room and demanded sex,

   They're making a new woman out of Carol
Wright.
   Wright is the fictional character whose cameo picture appears on
packets of manufacturers' coupons mailed to millions of U.S.
households each year.
   A consumer survey found that she appeared outdated, so Donnelly
Marketing Inc., the direct marketing agency that created her, is
gradually transforming her 19-year-old look into something more
contemporary.
   ``They (consumers) said she looked like Beaver Cleaver's mother,
that she was too perfect in every way, and that she probably did
windows while wearing an apron and pearls,'' said Joe Fenton,
director of marketing for the Carol Wright coupon program.
   Fenton said consumers thought Wright looked old-fashioned; her
hairstyle was outdated, for example, and the wide collar of her
blouse gave away her age.
   Donnelly Marketing has commissioned a series of new portraits to
bring her into the 1980s.
   The portraits, to be phased in between now and November, will
make gradual changes in Wright's appearance, including darker hair,
a new hairstyle, and slight variations in her eyes, earrings and
neckline.
   Fenton said the overall effect is to present a ``modern woman
concerned about her career as well as about her husband and
children.''

   Stray cats are wandering through

   The only cats that will be excused once caught are those with

   Unregistered cats caught in the box-like traps will be taken to
the Animal Welfare Society. They will be eligible for adoption, but
killed if no one takes them.
   ``We gave people a deadline of (Sunday) to get their cats
tagged,'' Brawley said. ``They next couple of days we'll be setting
out traps and baiting them with cat food. There's no harm to the
cat at all.''
   Councilman Robert Johnson said the increasing number of cats has
created a nuisance for the town's 361 residents.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan, calling
himself a pawn in a larger gun-control debate, pleaded innocent
Monday to charges he used an unregistered weapon to shoot a
teen-ager who took an uninvited dip in his backyard pool.
   Rowan has been charged with one count each of possessing an
unregistered weapon, and possessing ammunition for the gun, in
connection with the June 14 shooting. Both are misdemeanors.
   District of Columbia Superior Court Hearing Commissioner Kaye
Christian scheduled trial for Sept. 22, and released Rowan on his
own recognizance. Rowan requested a jury trial.
   If he is convicted on both charges, the columnist could face a
maximum penalty of two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   The district's 1976 handgun ordinance essentially bans posession
of handguns and ammunition not owned at the time the law was
passed, except for law officers.
   After his court appearance, Rowan lashed out at those who say he
is hypocritical for using a handgun.
   ``I am aware that I am the pawn in a brutal game between those
who favor and those who oppose handgun control,'' Rowan said,
reading a prepared statement to dozens of reporters and television
camera crews. ``I want to make it clear that I still favor a strict
national law to control the availability of handguns.
   ``There is no hypocrisy in advocating a national policy that no
one seems to be able to get through Congress,'' he said.
   The columnist also asserted that he has received additional
death threats since the shooting incident. He had previously told
police that he obtained the weapon used in the shooting after
receiving similar threats in 1982.
   Rowan has said that the gun and ammunition were originally owned
by his son, Carl Jr., who was told that he did not need to register
them because he was serving as an FBI agent at the time.
   Outside the courthouse, a half-dozen handgun advocates rallied
in support of the columnist's right to bear arms.
   ``We think that Carl Rowan may be guilty of raving hypocrisy,
but he shouldn't be charged in a court of law today for protecting
his home with a gun,'' said Lee Bellinger, the leader of Action for
America, a conservative activist group that champions the right to
private handgun ownership. ``We welcome him into the family of
people protecting their home with guns.''
   Other supporters carried posters reading, ``Warning: This home
protected by Carl Rowan,'' coupled with a Rambo-like drawing of
Rowan's head atop a muscle-bound, gun-toting torso. Still others
displayed signs reading, ``Leave Carl Rowan alone.''
   ``It (the Rowan shooting) shows what can happen in a moment of
panic,'' said Sarah Brady, wife of James Brady, President Reagan's
press secretary.
   She was not at the rally, but said in a telephone interview,
``With the handgun, in most cases you see more cases of misuse than
you do anything else.''
   Brady became president of Handgun Control, an anti-handgun
group, after her husband suffered permanent brain damage when he
was wounded during John Hinckley Jr.'s attempt to assassinate
Reagan in 1981.
   Rowan, 62, was cleared last month of assault charges in the
shooting incident after an investigation by federal prosecutors.
U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said at the time that he thought Rowan
should be prosecuted on the weapons charges, but deferred that
decision to District of Columbia officials, who normally decide
whether to prosecute such cases.
   The shooting occurred, Rowan said, when he heard noises in his
backyard, called police, and discovered Benjamin Smith, 18, of
suburban Chevy Chase, Md., and three other youths by his pool.
Rowan shot Smith in the wrist when, he said, the youth lunged at
him.
   Smith and a companion Laura Bachman, 19, were charged with
unlawful entry, but prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charges in
exchange for 40 hours of community service work.

   If, as Andy Warhol said, everyone will be famous
for 15 minutes, they'll be able to time their moments in the sun
with a Warhol-designed watch, record the event in a
Warhol-decorated diary and wear clothes inspired by the late pop
artist.
   A line of Warhol products ranging from business planning
calendars to watches costing several thousand dollars should appear
in retail stores early next year, said Roger Schlaifer, president
of Atlanta-based Schlaifer Nance & Co., which owns the marketing
rights to Warhol and his work.
   Schlaifer, whose company until earlier this year marketed
Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, said the Warhol products are still being
developed. But he said they would include clothing, bedding,
jewelry and paper products, such as calendars, posters and diaries.
   ``We're targeting a young, thinking audience where the Warhol
attitude and image is reflected,'' Schlaifer said.
   Some of the items will bear Warhol's likeness or that of his
work, while others will aim to capture the spirit of the artist,
Schlaifer said.
   Moderately priced items will be sold in ``better department and
specialty stores,'' Schlaifer said, while the expensive products
will be availble only through more exclusive outlets.
   Schlaifer, who commissioned Warhol to do a series of portraits
of the Cabbage Patch Kids, said he proposed to the artist a massive
marketing effort in 1985 and made a formal presentation a year
later.
   The talks slowed down but were revived only a week before Warhol
died on Feb. 22, 1987, at the age of 58, Schlaifer said. The deal
giving Schlaifer the marketing rights was finalized later with the
Warhol estate, he said.
   Schlaifer said Warhol, a former ad man who well known for his
silver-wigged celebrity status as well as for his works of art, was
enthusiastic about the idea.
   ``With his sense of commerce, and what we outlined in terms of
exposure, he was very excited,'' Schlaifer said. ``Andy Warhol was
unique in how he designed himself. In a way, he made himself as
unique as his art.''
   Despite Warhol's flair for publicity and his unconventional
approach to art, Schlaifer acknowledged there may be criticism of
such blatant commercial use of the artist's work.
   But he defended his plans, saying Warhol was not averse to
commercialism and noting that even the most respected museums have
gift shops.
   ``Virtually anything anyone does is subject to criticism,'' he
said. ``The question is, is it appropriate? Andy had a strong
commercial instinct.
   ``All museums have huge product enterprises that help support
the museum and educate the public. I'm not sure where that
criticism has validity, other than the position that art should
only be in the museums or in books.''
   Schlaifer said Warhol did not limit himself to creating museum
pieces. Warhol also made movies, started ``Interview'' magazine and
designed album covers for a number of rock and roll bands.
   ``He was commercial in a non-commercial way _ that was the
inherent irony in everything Warhol did,'' Schlaifer said.
   Schlaifer is banking on continuing fascination with Warhol and
his work.
   ``There's sort of an automatic excitement with anything
connected with the Warhol name,'' he said.
   He noted that an auction earlier this year of artwork and other
items owned by Warhol drew crowds and large sums of money, and said
displays of Warhol art, particularly a traveling exhibit planned
next year by New York's Museum of Modern Art, should heighten
interest.
   ``If anything, the acceptance is higher now than when we
originally proposed this,'' Schlaifer said. ``He's a major artist
by any definition. He gets more press dead than most celebrities do
alive.''

<HEAD>Carlucci Tells Kremlin Brass He Doubts Adoption of Defensive
Doctrine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told 200 top
Soviet officers Monday he has seen no evidence for the Kremlin's
claim that it has adopted a defensive military strategy.
   At the start of a four-day visit expected to offer a glimpse of
secret Soviet equipment and bases, Carlucci spent two hours with
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and addressed senior officers at
the General Staff's Voroshilov Academy.
   About 1,800 miles away in Central Asia, four missiles were blown
apart to begin the Soviet program of destroying more than 1,700
weapons under the superpower treaty banning intermediate-range
nuclear rockets, the official news agency Tass reported.
   Carlucci called the destruction of the missiles a ``great
event.'' Tass said the short-range missiles, known in the west as
SS-12s, were destroyed in the presence of U.S. inspectors at the
Saryozek test range in Kazakhstan.
   At the end of the day, Carlucci told reporters his talks with
Yazov ``went very well.'' He praised the academy staff for showing
him the classrooms and laboratories where Soviet military strategy
is developed.
   The tone of his speech to the officers was one of doubt about
the extent to which the Soviet military machine has been redirected
toward defense.
   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the Soviet chief of staff, and
other senior officers say Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
switching to defense as a military doctrine from the traditional
predominance of offensive weapons.
   ``We have difficulty in reconciling a defensive doctrine with
what we see in Soviet force structure and operational strategy as
an emphasis on the offensive,'' Carlucci said in his speech. ``We
see no shift of emphasis to the kind of forces traditionally
associated with defense.''
   ``We also have difficulty reconciling the U.S.S.R.'s pledge not
to be the first to use nuclear weapons with your continuing
emphasis on heavy ICBMs, such as the SS-18,'' he said. Carlucci
described the Soviet armory as ``a capability more compatible with
a military doctrine that emphasizes pre-emptive nuclear strikes.''
   He criticized the Soviet government for not making military
spending public and said Western analysts estimate 15 percent to 17
percent of the nation's wealth goes to defense. The current U.S.
military budget is 5.9 percent of the gross national product.
   ``No one begrudges you the need for a strong and capable army,''
Carlucci said. ``What troubles us is when the U.S.S.R. continues to
develop forces far in excess of what it needs for purposes of its
own defense.''
   He said the U.S. space-based defense project, formally named the
Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called ``Star Wars,'' is
a step toward greater stability that ``does not represent the
slightest threat to the U.S.S.R.''
   In a 20-minute question-and-answer session after the speech,
Carlucci defended the size of the U.S. Navy and the Pentagon's
doctrine of deterrence through adequate armed forces and weaponry.
   To reporters, he expressed pleasure that his schedule would
include access to Soviet defense installations and equipment, such
as the secret Blackjack bomber and the Sevastopol naval base on the
Crimean Peninsula.
   ``It's a unique experience for a U.S. defense secretary,'' he
said on arrival in Moscow. ``The American people through me can see
what the Soviet military is doing and can learn about their
attitudes and doctrine.''
   Carlucci said he believed he and Yazov could be more candid with
each other than other high-level officials because ``we are
soldiers.''
   They first met in Bern, Switzerland, in March and renewed the
acquaintance during the Reagan-Gorbachev summit at the end of May.
Both have called their active schedule of meetings as an
opportunity to ease tensions and solve problems.
   Among those traveling with Carlucci are Ron Lehman, assistant
secretary of defense, and representatives of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and State Department.
   The Americans will see the Taman army base and Kubinka air
field, both near Moscow, on Tuesday. They are to visit the Crimea
on Wednesday and leave for Turkey the next day after touring a ship
of the Black Sea fleet at Sevastopol.

   President Reagan was serenaded Monday by a
Washington, D.C., high school choir that won second place in the
Vienna International Youth Music Festival last month, then told the
youngsters, ``America takes pride in you.''
   The president, parents and friends heard the 54-member Eastern
High School choir perform ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and
``Polovetsian Dances,'' two of their prize-winning numbers.
   ``All of you, and all of us,'' the president said, ``are proud
of the tremendous job you did over there. You've competed against
the best the world had to offer and you came out ahead. America
takes pride in you today.''
   The choir is principally a gospel group but practiced 4{ hours a
day, five days a week for six months to perform in German and Latin
in the Austrian competition.
   ``You practiced endlessly, sometimes in Latin or German, and you
raised the money for the trip yourselves,'' Reagan said. ``Thank
you for brightening our day at the White House.''

   Two California men have agreed to stop
claiming that a solution of hydrogen peroxide that they sell can
prevent cancer and ease arthritis pain, the U.S. Postal Service
announced.
   The Postal Service said Kurt W. Donsbach, founder of DRK
Supplements of Huntington Beach, and his nephew, Richard Donsbach,
had signed an agreement promising to stop falsely representing
their product in mail-order sales.
   The agency said the elder Donsbach heads a group called National
Health Federation. He visits health conventions and writes books
and articles promoting hydrogen peroxide, an antiseptic sold by DRK
Supplements, it said.
   According to postal officials, the Donsbachs promoted sales of
their product with claims that it could prevent or stop the spread
of cancer and that it provides relief from arthritis pain.

<HEAD>Woods Says South Africans Bungled Handling of `Cry Freedom'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa badly bungled its handling of the
movie ``Cry Freedom'' turning it into a propaganda victory for
those fighting apartheid, according to Donald Woods, one of the
subjects of the film.
   Woods, a white South African journalist forced to flee the
country in 1978, also said on Monday that he suspected
right-wingers close to the government planted three bombs in
cinemas to disrupt screenings Friday.
   ``There are people on the fringes of the security police who can
be relied upon to do this sort of thing if they get the nod,''
Woods told The Associated Press in an interview.
   No one was hurt in the three bombings and many white South
Africans saw the film before the government seized all copies,
several hours after it began showing at 30 cinemas.
   Here for a Commonwealth foreign ministers' meeting on countering
South African censorship and propaganda, Woods said he never
expected ``Cry Freedom'' to be shown in South Africa.
   The movie tells the story of his friendship with black activist
Steve Biko, who died in police custody in 1977.
   ``The fact it was shown even for two showings was a bungle. They
had been counting on the censorship people reversing their
decision. When that failed, they were counting on the cinema
managers to chicken out. When they refused, the government decided
to send in the police,'' said Woods. ``I'm surprised at the
ineptitude.
   ``South Africans are normally unaware of the extent to which
their media are censored. But when there's all kinds of controversy
about a film and they see the government crudely taking the films
away, that's the most blatant form of censorship and even
non-politicized people might be politicized by that.''
   He said South Africans who have seen the movie were staggered.
``It's the truth of it that hits them _ to actually see things
they've known in their gut were going on,'' Woods said.
   He hoped the eight Commonwealth ministers, who meet Tuesday and
Wednesday under the chairmanship of Canadian Foreign Minister Joe
Clark, would decide to finance an underground press in South Africa
and set up a radio service outside the country to disseminate
uncensored news.
   Woods said unsigned news reports could be carried out by
couriers to London or Paris and distributed, provided they are
monitored by credible experts.
   Asked if he had been asked to play such a role, Woods, 54, said:
``I'd rather not say at this stage.''
   He will moderate a public forum on South African propaganda on
Tuesday.
   Calling on Canada to take the political lead, Woods said he
wants Western nations to sever diplomatic relations with Pretoria
but to maintain indirect links through the black front-line states,
such as Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Swaziland.
   ``There's a myth that white South Africans only get tougher if
you lean on them,'' Woods said. ``If every South African traveler
abroad had to go to Lesotho or Botswana, that would concentrate
their minds.''
   The Commonwealth summit in Vancouver in October asked the
foreign ministers' panel to review the fight against apartheid. The
ministers are from Australia, Canada, Guyana, India, Nigeria,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Britain declined, because Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher opposes tougher sanctions against
Pretoria.
   Woods said Mrs. Thatcher cannot indefinitely defy Commonwealth,
European Community and post-election U.S. pressure. ``She'll end up
U-turning just as she did in 1978 over Rhodesia becoming Zimbabwe.''
   Canada has organized an arts festival, a City Hall exhibition of
photos and posters banned in South Africa, and a lakefront
candle-lighting ceremony in conjunction with the meeting. Toronto
residents were asked to show their opposition to apartheid by
lighting candles in their windows.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson and New York Mayor Edward I. Koch
spoke by telephone Monday and agreed to meet in an effort to
resolve their differences and unite the Democratic Party behind
Michael Dukakis in the fall election.
   ``I have always kept open the door to communications. I believe
that people should talk,'' said Jackson, who lost New York's
Democratic primary in April and subsequently lost the nomination.
   Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, a Jackson supporter
and now co-chair of the Dukakis campaign in New York state, said
the meeting would be ``sometime in August'' but is ``not likely to
be this week.''
   Dinkins said the meeting would involve himself, Jackson, Koch,
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, Rep. Charles Rangel, and Stanley Hill, a
black labor leader in New York. He said it likely would take place
in Cuomo's Manhattan office.
   Koch criticized Jackson during the primary race, saying Jews
would be ``crazy'' to vote for Jackson, who supports Palestinian
self-determination.
   Jackson said Koch called him at his Chicago home early Monday
``and said he would like to meet.''
   Koch later issued a statement saying, ``I agree that in the
interest of party unity and the election of Michael Dukakis, it
would be good to meet with Jesse Jackson.''
   ``The Democratic Party is built on the premise that people with
different ideologies can come together under one tent. That's what
gets us elected.''
   But Koch added, ``I don't in any way recant my policy
differences with Jesse Jackson. They are there.... I hope to work
in support of Dukakis and then we'll continue the ideological
battle at another time.''
   ``My feelings toward the mayor are always open and respectful,''
Jackson said of Koch. ``His toward me were very hostile.''
   Jackson said Koch ``used race and religion as a litmus test and
divided the city and helped to lower the moral tone of the
campaign.''
   Both Dinkins and Rangel have been mentioned as possible
opponents to Koch in his re-election bid next year.
   Koch said he was not trying to use Jackson to gain support among
blacks for his own mayoral campaign.
   ``I'm not in contention this year,'' Koch said. ``And if you
really believe as I do that it's important to have a Democrat in
the White House, you set aside those differences.''
   While Dinkins said he welcomed the meeting, he questioned its
impact on the Dukakis campaign.
   ``The Dukakis campaign and the Jackson camp have come together
pretty well in forging an integrated policy and campaign staff'' in
New York state, Dinkins said.
   The New York-based American Jewish Committee said it hoped the
meeting would help heal the rift between blacks and Jews.
   ``We are in favor of anything which would dampen tensions and
heighten communications between the two communities,'' said AJC
Program Director Gary Rubin.
   The meeting ``will make a step toward doing that and the degree
to which it would reduce tension, we would welcome it,'' he said.
   Cuomo, who helped arrange the meeting, said ``I think it is a
commendable thing for Jesse Jackson, who feels insulted and who was
insulted by what was said, to say, `OK, you insulted me. You hurt
me. But in the interests of a truth greater than me or you, I will
sit down with you. Because we have urgent problems. ... Because
Dukakis and Bentsen are the only ones committed to dealing with
those urgent problems.' ''

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the official
English-language text of the U.N. report on chemical weapons use in
Iran and Iraq:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REPORT FROM THE VISIT TO IRAN:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We deeply regret to say that, on the basis of evidence gathered
during the present mission, and in spite of repeated appeals by the
United Nations, chemical weapons continue to be used on an
intensive scale against Iranian forces. As highlighted ... by
previous missions to Iran, the continued use of such weapons in the
present conflict increases the risk of their use in future
conflicts.
   It is also clear from accumulated evidence that the use of
chemical weapons in the present conflict has been intensifying and
has also become more frequent. If such trends continue, it may have
even more serious consequences than those that have already been
experienced.
   The use yperite (mustard gas) was again confirmed, both
medically and by chemical analysis ...
   The use of nerve gas or cyanide was not confirmed by chemical
analysis in the field, no doubt owing to their rapid disappearance
...
   According to patients as well as reports of doctors ... 2,000
people had been affected on the Majnoon Islands ...
   The chief of the medical service of the region further said
that, on June 25 ... there had been a massive attack by Iraqi
forces which had begun with artillery fire using chemical
ammunition and lasted for approximately two hours. Later, airplanes
and helicopters had joined the attack.
   According to the same source, the frontline had been attacked
with cyanide and organophospherous compounds. Logistic units,
command posts and reserves had also been attacked but with mustard
gas. Four emergency medical centers and one hospital in the zone
had been attacked with chemical weapons, although there had not
been victims, owing to protective measures ...
   The typical casualty could be described as a male soldier, 18 to
48 years of age, mostly in his 20s, the average being 24, who
suffered the effects of chemical agents contained in artillery
shells or in bombs which exploded on the ground between 4 and 200
(yards) away. Seventy-seven percent used a gas mask ...
   It has been possible to determine without any doubt that, in the
course of June 1988, Iranian soldiers were affected by yperite
(mustard gas). The 36 cases which were examined displayed typical
symptoms ... including lesions of erythema, darkening of the skin,
blisters, like second-degree burns, and respiratory lesions in a
few instances.
   From the examination of weapon fragments it can be concluded
that bombs similar in 1984, 1986 and 1987 have again been used
against Iranian forces on Iranian territory, indicating their
repeated utilization by Iraqi forces.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REPORT FROM THE VISIT TO IRAQ:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The presence of yperite (mustard gas) was again confirmed both
medically and by chemical analysis ..
   However, it is clear that the evidence resulting from this and
previous missions points to an ever-increasing presence of
different types of weapons associated with aggressive chemical
agents in the Iran-Iraq conflict, which has been leading
unavoidably to the repeated use of chemical weapons in violation of
the Geneva Protocol of 1925...
   The patients examined suffered, according to their statements
... the effects of chemical agents in a few mortar grenades
launched against them during two separate attacks with conventional
mortar munition at two locations near the front...
   On July 11, the team visited the camp outside Baghdad. After
donning protective equipment supplied by the military authorities,
as some grenades in the stockpile were leaking and were in bad
condition, we went into a bunker containing 81mm mortar grenades.
The number of grenades was stated to be 141, and they were claimed
to be chemical munition captured from Iranian forces in Salamcha,
east of Basra ...
   Unopened grenades still in wooden crates were tested ... A
positive response was obtained, suggestive of the presence of a
blister agent ...
   By visual examination, the alleged chemical grenades were
compared with a conventional high explosive grenade shown to us and
were found to be identical ...
   It has been possible to determine without any doubt that,
between the end of June and the beginning of July, nine Iraqi
soldiers were affected by yperite (mustard gas), four of them in a
military position named ``Peak 660'' near As Sulaymaniyah, and the
other five in the military sector of Basra.
   All of them had at least one of the following types of injury
typical to exposure to yperite: erythema, darkening of the skin,
conjunctivitis, blisters and injuries common to those found in
second-degree burns.

   Stanley Givirtz, a biblical scholar and
author who trained many rabbis, has died after a six-month bout
with cancer. He was 59.
   Givirtz, who died Friday, was a professor of biblical studies at
Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles, a rabbinical school for Reform
Judaism. He was well-known for his studies of ancient Near Eastern
languages and biblical Hebrew, said former classmate Dr. William
Bondareff, a University of Southern California psychiatry professor.
   ``He was an extraordinarily influential teacher of Hebrew and
probably responsible for the teaching of more rabbis in this
country than anyone else,'' Bondareff said.
   Givirtz, born in Brooklyn, New York, received his bachelor's
degree from Brooklyn College. He earned a Ph.D. at the University
of Chicago, where he taught from 1958 until 1972, when he joined
the faculty of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of
Religion here.
   In addition to teaching rabbinical students, Givirtz wrote a
book, ``Patterns in the Early Poetry of Israel,'' and had numerous
articles published in scholarly reviews.
   Givirtz is survived by his wife, Marianne; children Elihu, Sarah
and Aliza, and a sister, Frieda.

   Maria DeSillers was cleared Monday of any
connection with fingerprints found at the scene of a year-old
burglary at an elementary school in which $4,000 in donations for
her late son's liver transplant were stolen.
   The still unsolved theft generated an avalanche of publicity and
prompted President Reagan and others to donate a total of $689,000
for her son's three unsuccessful operations. After her son's death,
Ms. DeSillers was accused of misusing the funds.
   Fort Lauderdale police said last week they had received
unspecified information linking Mrs. DeSillers to the break-in, and
issued a search warrant for her fingerprints.
   She submitted to fingerprinting under protest Monday, and Fort
Lauderdale police quickly cleared her of any connection with a
print left in the school closet where the money was held, said
police spokesman Ott Cefkin.
   ``She is not a suspect and we have no physical evidence linking
her to the burglary,'' Cefkin said. ``But we would have been remiss
if we had not pursued it.''
   He refused to reveal what information led to the demand for
fingerprints, and said the investigation was continuing.
   Ms. DeSillers was not at home, but her attorney Roy Black said
he spoke to her after the police announcement.
   ``She was mad,'' said Black. ``She feels that she's been
humiliated and held up to scorn once again. There's a lot of people
out there now who think she stole that money.''
   Earlier Monday, a Dade County Circuit Court judge refused Ms.
DeSillers' request to block the police search warrant seeking her
fingerprints.
   ``We found enough probable cause to have a judge approve a
warrant,'' Assistant Dade State Attorney Richard Shiffrin said
after the hearing. ``There's probable cause to suspect her in
criminal activity.''
   The burglary at St. Anthon's Roman Catholic school in Fort
Lauderdale prompted people across the country to donate money for
the operations on her son, Ronnie.
   Among the $689,000 raised for the boy was a $1,000 donation from
President Reagan and his wife Nancy and a $200,000 gift from Miami
Beach millionaire Victor Posner.
   Fort Lauderdale police said a thief broke into a closet at the
accounting office of the school and took the money, which was
raised by Ronnie's classmates through bake sales, flower sales and
other fund-raisers. Most of the money was in change and small bills.
   Ronnie DeSillers died in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth
liver transplant at Pittsburgh's Children's Hospital. Ms. DeSillers
has refused to pay $262,000 in medical bills to Children's Hospital
in Pittsburgh, saying her son received improper care.
   A court-appointed caretaker of the donated funds said Ms.
DeSillers improperly used $200,000 of the money on luxury items
ranging from jewelry to a BMW sports car.
   On Thursday, a Dade circuit judge ruled that she is not entitled
to the remaining $240,000 of the donated money and that it should
instead pay medical bills, debts and help other needy ill children.

Swaggart visited the birthplace of Jesus in the occupied West Bank

   Swaggart, who also toured a Jewish settlement, told The

predicted its establishment.
   ``The prophets ... foretold of the nation of Israel once
becoming a state and the people coming back to Israel,'' Swaggart
said in Bethlehem, where he videotaped two 20-minute TV programs.
``God's arch enemy, Satan, does not want these prophecies to be
fulfilled and will do everything he can to end it and to cause
difficulties.
   ``That's how the political unrest enters in it today,'' he said,
referring to the nearly eight-month uprising in the occupied lands.
   Swaggart and his entourage then proceeded to Tekoa, a Jewish
settlement about nine miles south of Jerusalem, and got a taste of
the uprising when their black Mercedes limousine drove around a
burning tire that blocked the road.
   Jewish settler Bobby Brown received Swaggart and his wife,
Frances, on a vine-covered patio typical of the flourishing lush
settlement.
   Quoting from the Old Testament's Book of Amos, Brown told
Swaggart the Jewish settlers were reviving a land that had laid
barren and empty for thousands of years.
   ``Do you think this is a fulfillment of the prophecy?'' Swaggart
asked.
   ``I believe that,'' Brown said.``The work we're doing is God's
work.''
   Swaggart, who brought 350 followers to Israel at a time when
many tourists are shunning the country, has been welcomed with open
arms. But a columnist in the Hebrew Davar newspaper warned Monday
that Swaggart's support of Israel was a double-edged sword.
   According to Swaggart's theory, the state of Israel is merely a
vehicle to the coming of the Second Kingdom, when all Jews will
have to convert to Christianity, wrote columnist Yoram Perry.
   ``No, Jimmy Swaggart does not love us,'' Perry wrote.
``Certainly not love for its own sake.''
   Swaggart, who runs a television ministry that reaches 2 million
viewers from its base in Baton Rouge, La., stepped down from the
pulpit in February after admitting he sinned against his wife.
   A prostitute said he paid her to strip and perform lewd acts for
him during visits to a motel.
   The Lousiana Assemblies of God denomination revoked his ministry
credentials after he returned to the pulpit against their wishes in
May.
   Swaggart has refused to discuss the scandal except to say that
he has put it behind him.

<HEAD>Thousands Demand Truth About World War II Massacre</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Poles marking the 44th
anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against the Nazis demanded
Monday that the Soviet Union end its silence over alleged
atrocities against Poles during World War II.
   Speakers also called for less interference from Moscow and
demanded the right to hold free elections.
   ``Moscow has to realize that we fought on all fronts of the war,
but we still have not regained our freedom,'' said Wojciech
Ziembinski, an independent opposition activist.
   Crowds filled Warsaw's Powazki military cemetery to pay homage
to those who fell during the 63-day revolt against Nazi occupation.
   The Nazis crushed the uprising. More than 245,000 people were
killed and 85 percent of the city was destroyed.
   While scores of Poles lighted candles and laid flowers on the
graves of friends and family members, hundreds of others gathered
around a granite monument to Polish officers murdered in the Katyn
forest near the Soviet city of Smolensk.
   The massacre remains one of Poland's most bitter wartime
memories and a sore spot in its relations with the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets have never acknowledged responsibility for the
incident, in which 4,300 Polish military officers were shot to
death and left in a mass grave.
   Western historical sources indicate the Poles were murdered on
the orders of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in the spring of 1940.
But official Soviet and Polish histories claim that the Nazis
killed them in 1941.
   A banner draped across the monument Monday read: ``Give us
truth, Katyn 1940.'' Later, a group of youths raised a banner which
read: ``Solidarity will prove the truth about Katyn.''
   Last year an official commission was established by the Polish
and Soviet governments to investigate the incident.
   To the disappointment of many Poles, Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev did not mention Katyn during a speech to the Polish
parliament in July. However, he did make a general pledge to
continue to pursue the elimination of gaps in official histories.
   Although the Katyn memorial was the emotional focus of Monday's
tribute, the gathering quickly turned political in tone.
   ``We want the renewal of Poland, but not for communism,'' said
Seweryn Jaworski, an activist of the outlawed Solidarity trade
union, in a reference to the government's reform plans.
   While none of the Solidarity leadership was visible at the Katyn
monument, the crowd repeatedly flashed the union's two-fingered
V-sign.

<HEAD>Detective Chief In Palermo Resigns, Deepening Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of police detectives in this
Sicilian capital resigned Monday, deepening a crisis in Italy's
battle against the Mafia.
   The resignation of Antonio Nicchi came two days after Italy's
top investigator of organized crime, Giovanni Falcone, and eight
fellow magistrates resigned from the ``anti-Mafia pool'' in Sicily,
asking to be transferred.
   A prominent Sicilian prosecutor, Paolo Borsellino, two weeks ago
charged that Mafia investigations were being blocked by top
judicial officials, an inefficient and chaotic police department,
and an indifferent state.
   ``In Palermo you can't work in peace any more,'' Nicchi told
journalists Monday.
   Borsellino said detectives had not produced any significant
reports on the Mafia since 1982.
   But Nicchi told the Palermo newspaper L'Ora: ``I've been in this
office since 1985 and I have presented a dozen reports, on the
Mafia, on drugs, on homicides, even on the new balance of power
between the (crime) families.''
   Borsellino's declarations to journalists prompted President
Francesco Cossiga to order the ministries of Justice and Interior
and the Superior Council of Magistrates, which oversees judges, to
investigate problems in the anti-Mafia unit in Sicily.
   On Monday, politicians and newspapers called on the state to pay
more attention to the war on organized crime.
   ``People ought to know that judges alone cannot fight the Mafia
phenomenon and that the battle against the Mafia will never be won
without an adequate commitment from political forces and in first
place those of the government,'' said the president of the National
Association of Judges, Raffaele Bertoni.

<HEAD>Ranks Restored In Chinese Army</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China on Monday brought back military ranks to
its army in a move to modernize its fighting force and boost morale
after years of personnel cuts and tight budgets.
   The move came on the 61st anniversary of the People's Liberation
Army and 23 years after Mao Tse-tung banned ranks as inappropriate
to his classless peasant army.
   On Oct. 1, China's national day, soldiers are to don new
uniforms with insignia designating their military positions.
   The government also issued regulations spelling out awards to be
given to servicemen and their families ``so as to encourage their
dedicated spirit in defending and building the motherland.''
   The new regulations guarantee servicemen that they will not lose
their farmland when they are conscripted, as well offer pensions to
those disabled in combat and pay damages to the families of those
who died in combat.
   On Saturday, Communist Party Secretary General Zhao Ziyang and
other senior leaders gathered at the Great Hall of the People to
bestow medals on more than 80,000 veterans.
   Western military analysts in Beijing, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the ranking system was designed to raise the morale
of the army, after troop strength and state funding were slashed in
the past decade and many military factories were converted to
civilian use.
   The analysts said a need for reinstating ranks became evident
after the Chinese army's embarrassing showing in a brief 1979
border war with Vietnam.
   ``These kinds of units need a strict command structure, with a
clear delineation as to who is giving and who is receiving the
orders,'' said a diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Before today they didn't have that.''
   The analysts said Monday's move is also aimed at ridding the
army of leftist influences.
   In 1965, Mao abolished military ranks as part of his attempt to
create a radically egalitarian society, in which a massive peasant
army would would be called on to fight a ``people's war.''
   Deng Xiaoping, who rose to power in 1978, has rejected Mao's
concept and has tried to create a professional army. Today, 70
percent of military commanders have college educations, compared to
1.6 percent in 1982.
   Deng, who controls the military as head of the central military
commission, has reduced the size of China's armed forces to 3
million, from 4 million in 1985, and has introduced modern
technology.
   He has also shaved the military's share of the government budget
from 17.5 percent in 1978 to less than 10 percent.
   Deng has also supported the transfer of ``cadres,'' or officers,
to civilian duty as part of an effort to cut the oversized corps,
many of whom were either aging or poorly trained.
   Among the 1 million soldiers demobilized in the past few years,
450,000 were cadres. The government announced that an additional
100,000 officers would be transferred to a civilian staff of
educators and specialists.

<HEAD>Atlanta Newspapers Restore Use Of Courtesy Titles For Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution,
bucking recent trends in newspaper style, have restored the use of
courtesy titles for men and women in their news columns.
   ``Under the new rules, the first reference to individuals will
include full proper names along with the use of public, military,
professional and ecclesiastical titles,'' the newspapers said in a
front-page note announcing the policy in their combined editions
Sunday.
   ``On second reference, names will be preceded by the earned
title or the courtesy title for all individuals and not just for
women, as is now the case.''
   For example, when the newspaper writes about the city's top
elected official, it will be Mayor Andrew Young on first reference
and Mayor Young on subsequent references. Or, in stories about one
of the city's top businessmen, it will be Ted Turner, followed by
Mr. Turner.
   The decision is in contrast to many newspapers which have moved
closer to dropping courtesy titles such as Mr., Mrs., Miss or Ms.
Only a few newspapers, notably The New York Times and The Wall
Street Journal, use the courtesy title ``Mr.''
   ``For some time we have been troubled by the limited use of
courtesy titles in our news columns,'' Editor Bill Kovach said in
the front-page note.
   ``We hope the sense of dignity and respect that the consistent
use of courtesy titles implies will more adequately reflect the
relationship we believe exists between us and our readers,'' said
Kovach, who came to the newspapers from The New York Times'
Washington bureau.
   The newspapers left unchanged their policy for sports stories,
which do not include courtesy titles for men or women.

<TEXT>
   The University of Notre Dame's famed
golden dome is getting a facelift this summer with the painstaking
application of micro-thin layers of gold leaf.
   The administration building dome and its 19-foot cast iron
statue of the Virgin Mary have been campus landmarks since 1882,
when the building was erected to replace one destroyed by fire.
   The statue has been gilded at least four times, but never
stripped down to the cast iron before any reguilding, said Ronald
Gruenke, a restoration export with the Wisconsin company handling
the $300,000, seven-week project.
   ``It had a surface like alligator skin _ crackled and scaled,''
he said.
   The workers have a perspective on the statue not available to
those on the ground, 158 feet below.
   ``Mary's kneecaps come up to about eye height, and her
outstreched hands are each the size of a table,'' said worker
Robert Pettis.
   For the dome, this latest regilding will be the ninth, and the
first since 1961.

   Officials at City Hall had reason to blush
a little Monday. A radio reporter caught them watering the lawn on
the wrong day.
   For several months, the city has restricted lawn sprinkling
because of problems in the water distribution system. Even-numbered
addresses are allowed to water on even-numbered days while those
with odd-numbered addresses can do so on the opposite days.
   Well, City Hall is located at 200 N. Walker Ave. _ an
even-numbered address.
   And Monday was Aug. 1 _ an odd number.
   But for much of the morning, a sprinkler was running on the City
Hall lawn.
   City spokeswoman Karen Farney acknowledged the mistake.
   She told radio station KOMA-AM the sprinkler will be left off
Tuesday to make up for the error.
   And she acknowledged that the city was not setting the best of
examples.

<TEXT>
   Drought-stricken farmers may get some
federal aid by the October harvest, but only if Congress passes a
relief bill in the next two weeks and gets it past President
Reagan, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Monday.
   Separate versions of the bill, which will cost between $4
billion and $6 billion to implement, have passed in both houses of
Congress, but Lyng warned that the Senate version contains some
provisions he considers extravagant.
   ``I am hopeful they will be able to reconcile their differences
and take out some of the more extravagant provisions that do not
really apply to those farmers that have suffered in the drought,''
Lyng said at a news conference before addressing the annual meeting
of the Soil and Water Conservation Society.
   If that reconciliation comes in the next two weeks, financial
assistance could be on its way to farmers ``close to the first of
October. I would hope that we could do it around the time that
would coincide with the normal harvest,'' he said.
   Lyng said a joint conference committee is to meet Wednesday to
discuss both versions of the bill.
   He said he considers amendments in the House version alloting
assistance to farmers who produce their own feed for their
livestock more feasible than the Senate version, which broadens aid
to include livestock and poultry farmers who do not grow their own
feed.
   Lyng said he would not disclose what his own recommendations to
Reagan will be, nor would he predict if the measure will be vetoed.
   Lyng also said recent rain has helped the cornbelt, but not
enough.
   ``The economic damage is very severe in the cornbelt, unlike
anything we have ever seen,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Roadblocks to check drivers for signs of
intoxication are ineffective and unconstitutional, the Michigan
Court of Appeals ruled Monday in upholding a lower court's ruling
against the state.
   ``While the goals of the sobriety checkpoint program are
laudable, the program fails to qualify as a reasonable seizure
under the Fourth Amendment,'' the three-judge appeals panel wrote
in a unanimous opinion.
   The state attorney general's office did not immediately have a
comment about the ruling or any plans for further appeals. The
Michigan Supreme Court in 1975 refused to rule on the
constitutionality of systematic roadblock stops.
   Monday's ruling upholds the conclusions of Wayne County Circuit
Judge Michael Stacey, who issued a permanent injunction stopping
the roadblocks on the grounds that they violated both the federal
and state constitutions.
   Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU's Michigan chapter,
praised Stacey's 60-page opinion as ``the most extensive,
definitive, best-reasoned analysis in the country of the alleged
effectiveness of sobriety roadblocks and the extent to which they
intrude upon the civil liberties of innocent motorists.''
   ``I'm glad it was upheld,'' he said. ``Now the state should do
what we suggested all the time, namely get down to the business of
cracking down on drunken driving without violating the rights of
innocent motorists.''
   The program devised by state police followed a blueprint drafted
from check lane laws in 37 other states and the District of
Columbia. Its prime model was Maryland's program, and the opinion
noted the testimony of a Maryland State Police lieutenant who said
checkpoints there yielded few drunken driving arrests.
   Gov. James Blanchard, who pushed through the program and made it
one of his top priorities in 1986, would not comment until his
staff had time to review the decision, spokesman Tom Scott said.
   The issue of anti-drunk checkpoints has come up in courts in
about half of the states with mixed results, according to the
Michigan appellate opinion.
   State courts in Virginia, Illinois, Florida and Massachusetts
have upheld the roadblocks while they have been struck down in
Oregon, Washington and New Hampshire.
   The U.S. Supreme Court hasn't ruled on anti-drunk roadblocks but
implied in a 1979 case that they are acceptable. The high court
said police may not selectively stop drivers who are not suspected
of breaking any law, but mentioned roadblocks among possible
acceptable alternatives.
   In 1986, the high court refused to hear arguments in a case
challenging Virginia's roadblocks. That decision had the effect of
letting Virginia continue the checkpoints.

   A former bodyguard for the rap music group
Run-D.M.C. was sentenced to four years in prison Monday for
involuntary manslaughter in the death of a man at a concert two
years ago.
   Garfield Brown originally was charged with murder but pleaded
guilty to the lesser offense of manslaughter in the death of Alex
Baldwin, 21.
   Police said several fights broke out during a Run-D.M.C. concert
at Selland Arena in Fresno on Aug. 15, 1986, and Brown and two
other bodyguards left the stage to help restore order.
   Brown was charged with throwing Baldwin to the concrete floor
and kicking him. Baldwin died of head injuries two weeks later, and
Brown was arrested in New York City.
   Superior Court Judge Steve Vartabedian ordered that the
manslaughter term begin after Brown completes a nine-year prison
sentence in New York for robbery and burglary.

   A teen-ager who claims he encountered a
``Lizard Man'' creature on the edge of a swamp is cashing in on the
story.
   Christopher Davis, 17, is busy staffing the Lizard Man
Information Center in Bishopville, a town of 3,400 about 45 miles
northeast of Columbia.
   He is autographing $10 T-shirts bearing the likeness of the
creature he said he saw on a road at the edge of the Scape Ore
Swamp almost a month ago.
   Davis answers questions, signs autographs and poses for pictures
in front of his brown, 1976 Toyota Celica, pointing to where the
so-called Lizard Man scraped paint as he clung to the roof of
Davis' speeding car.
   Shepherding Davis through the attention is Joye Reis, from
nearby Sumter, who says she's representing Davis and taking 10
percent of everything he makes.
   ``I've always been interested in the unknown,'' she said.
   Ms. Reis and her partner, Randy Galloway, say that in the wake
of intense media interest, it's only right for Davis to reap some
of the benefits from his harrowing episode.
   Davis freely admits, ``I'm not in it for my health.''
   Other entrepreneurs are cashing in on Lizardmania as well,
selling T-shirts, bumper stickers and Lizard Man dolls.
   Davis says he encountered the creature at 2 a.m., after changing
a tire on his car. ``The moonlight was out. I turned around and saw
a red-eyed devil. He was about 30 yards from me, in the field. It
had real long arms. When he would run, his arms would swing,''
Davis said.
   Davis said he drove off and the creature jumped on the roof, but
apparently fell off.
   Davis didn't tell authorities about the experience until later,
when he heard that a couple had reported a similar creature had
pulled chrome and molding off their car.

<TEXT>
   Most of 181 local prosecutors interviewed by a
weekly legal affairs newspaper said they are having little or no
impact in the war against drugs, despite higher spending, the paper
reported Monday.
   The prosecutors called for more money for their efforts and
rated some federal drug-fighting policies as little help, the
National Law Journal said.
   It said a quarter of the prosecutors favored decriminalizing
marijuana.
   Sixty-five percent of the prosecutors who were interviewed said
their resources were inadequate to fight drugs. As well as more
money, most called for laws making it easier to seize property from
drug offenders.
   But more than seven in 10 of those interviewed called the
federal government's ``zero tolerance'' program ``not very
important'' or ``not important,'' the Journal said. That program
includes moves to seize property in which federal agents find even
a minuscule amount of illegal drugs.
   Dean St. Dennis, a Justice Department spokesman, said Monday he
believed prosecutors would favor the zero-tolerance program if they
knew fully about it. He also said the department strongly opposed
marijuana decriminalization.
   The Journal said it interviewed the chief prosecutors or their
top drug deputies in 181 of the 250 largest local jurisdictions in
the country this month. The local prosecutors were promised
confidentiality. Statewide and federal prosecutors were not
interviewed.
   When asked about the effect of their work, six in 10 of those
interviewed said they had very little or no impact in reducing the
illegal drug supply; about as many said they had little or no
impact raising the price of drugs; and 57 percent said they had
little or no impact deterring drug use.

   An Army laboratory in Hawaii has positively
identified the remains of an Air Force colonel from Utah missing
from the Vietnam war, the Pentagon said Monday.
   The remains of Col. Mark L. Stephensen were among a group of 27
repatriated to the United States on April 6.
   Three of the remains from that group were identified earlier
this summer by the Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu.
The others are still undergoing analysis.
   Stephensen was flying an RF-4C reconnaissance jet over North
Vietnam when he disappeared on April 29, 1967. At the time, he was
36 years old and listed his home of record as Salt Lake City.
   ``The remains will depart Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii with a
full military honors ceremony on Tuesday and travel to Travis Air
Force Base, Calif., for their final journey home,'' a Pentagon
statement said.
   With the latest identification, 2,393 Americans continue to be
listed as missing in Indochina as a result of the Vietnam war, of
whom 1,757 are listed as missing in Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 162 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the
laboratory since the end of the war.

   Actor Lou Diamond Phillips, predominantly
Filipino on his mother's side with a little Chinese, Hawaiian and
Spanish blood mixed in, recognizes the advantage of his ethnicity.
   ``I can play most of the brown races,'' Phillips said in a
recent interview. ``There are a lot of blond-haired, blue-eyed
actors out there, and good ones at that. But in my category there
aren't that many actors in the running.''
   Phillips made his film debut portraying Ritchie Valens in last

Hollywood actors in the upcoming western ``Young Guns.''
   The Billy the Kid movie starring Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen,
Kiefer Sutherland and Phillips is being released Aug. 12. Phillips
stars as Jose Chavez y Chavez of Mexican and Navajo Indian heritage.
   ``The truth of the matter is when a Chavez y Chavez character
comes up, I'm on the A List for the part, which is nice,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   LONGVIEW, Wash. _ Most actors make their living as smooth
talkers, but as the silent partner of the Bartles & Jaymes wine
cooler ads, Dick Maugg earns his fee by keeping his mouth shut.
   The silent act is a key ingredient of an ad campaign that helped
establish the Gallo Winery product in the market and brought Maugg
``more money than I ever thought I'd make.''
   In a recent interview, Maugg said his laid-back appearance
belies the tense atmosphere that surrounds each taping of the
folksy commercials.
   ``They take a lot of time to do very little. It can get
nerve-racking standing around so much,'' he said.
   Maugg is spending part of his earnings on a Kalama River cabin
he's building near the Western Washington city of Longview where he
was born and raised.
   Maugg joined David Rufkhar _ who has the speaking lines _ on the
wine cooler's pitch team just 10 days before the first ads were
shot.
   A San Francisco ad agency went to Maugg's home where they ``put
a baseball cap on me, started shooting film and told me to say,
`Hello there,' a couple times,'' he said.
   He lost his lines, but gained a spot in 180 different
commercials, of which about 70 have been broadcast.

<HEAD>Anglican Bishops Reject Call To Keep from Consecrating Women
Bishops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The world's Anglican bishops on
Monday rejected a call to refrain from consecrating women bishops
and accepted a compromise resolution that such elevation of women
should not divide the Anglican Communion.
   On a show of hands, the bishops voted 423-28 with 19 abstentions
to maintain links with any of their 27 self-governing churches
which consecrate a woman bishop, even if they disagree.
   The U.S. Episcopalians and the Canadian and New Zealand
Anglicans say they may consecrate a woman bishop by the end of this
year.
   The resolution preserving the unity of the 70 million-member
Anglican Communion was drafted by conference participants who
considered it for most of the first two weeks of the three-week
Lambeth Conference.
   It is the bishops' first gathering in 10 years.
   On a secret ballot, the bishops voted 277-187 against a
resolution proposed by Archbishop of Sydney Donald Robinson that
the churches should ``refrain from consecrating a woman as bishop''
to avoid further damage over the issue of women priests and bishops.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the
Church of England and leader of the Anglican Communion, said after
the two votes that despite differences of opinion, the conference
acted in a spirit of unity.
   Runcie said before the vote that however the count went, he
agreed with its recommendation that he appoint a commission to
prepare guidelines for relations among the churches once women
bishops are appointed. He said his commission would ``start
meetings well before the end of this year.''
   Runcie said of the compromise resolution, ``It wasn't a fudge _
it was very carefully worked out respecting of differences and the
determination to live together. ... Tell me what other way you hold
a communion together when it is deeply divided about something
which is of great importance to some people and of little
importance to others in the mission of the church.''
   Robinson, metropolitan of New South Wales, said his resolution
simply invited the conference to express its mind.
   ``It is contrary to the explicit teaching of the New Testament
that women be given responsibility for the authority of the
Scriptures in the congregation,'' he said.
   But Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning of the U.S. Episcopal
Church, which has ordained hundreds of women priests in the past 11
years, differed.
   ``Restraint is not a true option,'' Browning said. ``When we
heard or read that it is only a matter of time before women will be
elected bishops in U.S. Episcopal Church, this is not a statement
of defiance. It is simply looking into our future as a province
(church) based on our past and our present.
   ``Ordained women are already a feature of our church life. Our
people have been blessed by the priestly ministry of ordained women
for more than a decade. Therefore, the people of our diocese move
ahead toward calling women to be bishops in a way that is authentic
to our experience.''
   Many of the Anglican bishops, clergy and laity oppose ordaining
women. About 1,200 women priests have been ordained by a minority
of the churches, mostly by the U.S. Episcopalians. Opponents call
the practice contrary to Scripture and tradition. They say they
could not accept a woman bishop though they might eventually accept
women priests.
   Bishops are regarded as the successors of the Apostles of Jesus
Christ. All were men.
   Bishop William Pwaisiho of Malaita in the Pacific territory of
Melanesia, denounced ordaining women as ``Satanic.''
   ``I think you are not listening to us _ and my color doesn't
help, either,'' said Pwaisiho, who is black.
   ``No woman should be consecrated for the sake of the unity we
seek,'' appealed another African prelate, Bishop Benjamin Nwankiti
of Owerri, Nigeria.
   But a black prelate from Washington, D.C., Bishop John T.
Walker, said white men who had long prevented blacks from becoming
bishops were now using the same arguments against women.
   ``In Christ there is neither male nor female,'' Walker said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan asserted Monday that
``America is in a new era of opportunity'' and said the voters will
decide whether to switch direction by electing Democrat Michael
Dukakis as president.
   Without mentioning Dukakis' name, Reagan, in a speech prepared
for a fund-raiser for Sen. William V. Roth,R-Del., tweaked the
Massachusetts Democrat for declaring in his nomination acceptance
speech that ``the Reagan era'' is ending.
   ``Does he want to end the era of lower tax rates and higher real
income for families, record numbers of jobs, low inflation and
interest rates, steady growth and respect, not just lip-service for
families,'' Reagan asked.
   ``The American people may have a thing or two to say about
that.''
   Reagan said ``that same candidate'' claims he has balanced 10
budgets in a row.
   But the president said that the Dukakis budget for Massachusetts
``includes almost a half a billion dollars of new borrowing,
drawing reserves and tapping pension funds, and the kind of
creative accounting that nearly sent New York City to the poor
house a few years ago.''
   ``America this year has come to a divide in the road,'' Reagan
said. ``Take one fork and we continue in the direction that Bill
Roth has helped chart.''
   ``Take the other, and in four years, all of us may be picking up
the pieces. Today, America has peace and prosperity, growth and
opportunity. We can re-elect them or turn to the liberal
alternative,'' he said.

   Drunken-driving experts and bus safety
officials will join witnesses to a bus crash that killed 27 people
when testimony gets under way Tuesday in a National Transportation
Safety Board hearing.
   The May 17 accident occurred when a pickup truck going the wrong
way on Interstate 71 slammed into a bus owned by the Radcliff First
Assembly of God church. Authorities contend the driver of the
pickup was drunk at the time.
   NTSB spokesman Allan Pollock said accident survivors probably
will not testify because the agency doesn't want to traumatize them.
   The pickup driver, Larry Mahoney, 35, has been indicted on 27
counts of murder, 13 counts of first-degree assault, 44 counts of
first-degree wanton endangerment and one count of drunken driving.
It will be the worst drunken-driving accident in U.S. history if he
is convicted on the final charge, according to the NTBS and Mothers
Against Drunk Driving.
   The board will hear testimony on six issues, five of which
concern drunken driving, Pollack said. The sixth involves bus
safety.
   Pollock said testimony will be taken on the performance and
capabilities of drivers under the influence of alcohol; the extent
of the drunken-driving problem; and the effectiveness of alcohol
education and treatment programs.
   He said the witnesses also will address the adequacy of
sanctions Kentucky's courts impose on drunken drivers and the
development of effective alcohol countermeasure programs like jail
terms, fines and license revocation.
   The accident has raised questions about bus safety because all
67 passengers on board survived the impact but the victims died
when the bus's gas tank was punctured, causing a fire that quickly
engulfed the vehicle. The fire blocked the front door, leaving the
rear emergency door as the only escape route.
   The safety issues to be discussed include emergency exits; the
upgrading of buses built before April 1977 when stricter federal
safety rules became effective; the flammability of seats; and the
placement and protection of the fuel tank.
   The board will draft a report on the probable causes of the
crash and make recommendations for avoiding similar accidents. The
recommendations could be directed toward federal, state and local
officials, as well as bus manufacturers, but the safety board has
no power to require that any of them be implemented.

   A deliveryman who foiled a robbery by
ramming his truck into a getaway car says he just wanted to get the
thieves' license number _ but he was angry, too.
   ``I was a little mad that I walked in for a delivery and I was
getting robbed, while I was at work,'' said Tom Swartz, 30, a
driver for United Parcel Service.
   At a preliminary hearing last Friday, Swartz identified the
suspects, Gillie Garcia, 50, and Edmund Herrera, 31, as the men who
were robbing City Surplus Paint Co. when Swartz made a delivery to
the store in the Denver suburb of Mountain View on June 16.
   The intruders had bound three employees in a back office,
emptied the cash register and robbed several customers when the UPS
driver walked in, authorities said. Swartz said he, too, was robbed.
   As the men fled with about $400, Swartz followed them out. ``I
decided to go get the license number,'' he said.
   He got into his UPS truck and drove around to the side of the
store, where he saw a Cadillac coming at him with one robber
inside. He rammed his truck into the car, Swartz said.
   Police arrested Herrera at the scene, and later took Garcia into
custody in nearby Lakewood.
   The episode received national attention because an initial
report quoted witnesses as saying Swartz's UPS supervisor had
``cursed'' him for damaging the company truck and threatened to
take away his good driving record, a basis for promotions.
   Swartz and the company later said the supervisor had not cursed
Swartz, and UPS praised the driver's actions, saying the collision
would not be charged against his record. The company honored Swartz
for heroism at a reception June 24.
   In Friday's hearing, Jefferson County Judge Robert Morris
concluded there was sufficient evidence to try both suspects on six
counts each of aggravated robbery and one count each of felony
menacing.
   The men, both held on $100,000 bonds, are to be arraigned Aug.
15 in Jefferson County District Court.

   The Illinois farmer who was shot down
over Nicaragua last year and imprisoned there for 56 days has
returned to Central America in hopes of retrieving his airplane,
his brother said Monday.
   William Denby said his brother James is trying to clear a lien
that was placed on the plane to ensure payment of fees to the
lawyer who represented him in Nicaraguan courts.
   ``All he said was, `Hey, I'm going to Nicaragua,''' said William
Denby, who said his brother had been in Central America for ``a
couple of weeks.''
   On Dec. 6, James Denby was flying to a farm he owns in Costa
Rica when his single-engine Cessna was hit by rifle fire and he was
forced to land on the Nicaraguan coast.
   Nicaraguan officials said they found documents linking Denby to
U.S.-backed Contra rebels fighting the country's leftist Sandinista
government.
   Denby denied the allegations, although he said in a 1987
interview with The Associated Press that he had ferried wounded
Contras to hospitals in his plane.
   He was acquitted by a Nicaraguan court in early February.
   At the time, Denby said in news interviews he would be very
reluctant to return to Nicaragua. ``They would have to send an
aircraft carrier,'' he said.
   But William Denby indicated his brother had received assurances
that he would be safe.
   ``I'm sure he was not concerned about his well-being in
Nicaragua,'' William Denby said
   He said that during this visit, his brother ``said he was
treated better in Nicaragua than in Costa Rica,'' where officials
had not been formally notified that the Nicaraguan charges had been
dropped.
   Though he said his information was sketchy, William Denby said
his brother ``apparently has gotten or is getting his aircraft back
from the government.''
   Telephone calls to James Denby's family home near Carlinville
were not answered Monday.

<HEAD>Hospital Ordered to Justify Hinckley Field Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mental hospital where John W. Hinckley Jr.
is being held was ordered Monday to justify its plan to allow the
presidential assailant to join a day-long field trip outside the
hospital with other patients.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker granted a request by
federal prosecutors for a court hearing on the proposal by St.
Elizabeths Hospital to let Hinckley go on a supervised
``recreational'' day trip away from the guarded facility.
   Parker gave the hospital until Friday to file with him all
treatment records and other documents to support its conclusion
that Hinckley would ``benefit therapeutically'' from the trip and
that he could participate ``without posing a danger to himself or
to others.''
   Hinckley, who shot and wounded President Reagan and three others
on March 31, 1981, has been held at St. Elizabeths since 1982, when
he was acquitted of criminal charges by reason of insanity.
   Last year, the government successfully opposed an attempt by
hospital authorities to allow Hinckley to visit his parents over
the Easter weekend.
   The proposal was withdrawn after it was disclosed in court that
Hinckley had corresponded with convicted multiple murderer Theodore
Bundy, who is on Florida's death row.
   The Secret Service said it opposed the hospital's latest plan,
which was outlined in a July 19 letter to the judge.
   The letter did not specify what sorts of activities the field
trip would involve. Hospital officials said they might include
bowling, a picnic or music.

   Church of England envoy Terry Waite and the other
foreign hostages held in Lebanon may be released by the end of the
year, an Anglican archbishop back from discussions in Iran
predicted Monday.
   Britain, meanwhile, said it is reviewing its strained relations
with Iran, further fueling hopes of freedom for hostages believed
held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
   The news followed a weekend in which Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher spoke of improving British-Iranian relations and the
Church of England announced it had sent a church official on a
hostage mission to Lebanon.
   David Penman, the archbishop for Melbourne, Australia, and an
expert on Islam, said after his trip to Tehran that ``intuition''
leads him to believe the hostages will be released from Lebanon
after Israel's Nov. 1 elections and U.S. elections a week later.
   ``I would not be surprised if Terry Waite and the others were
released before the end of the year,'' Penman told a news
conference in Canterbury, where he is attending an international
conference of Anglican bishops. He visited Tehran on his way to
England last month.
   Penman said he had discussions about Waite in Tehran ``with some
of my hosts, but I cannot talk about them.''
   Waite disappeared in Beirut Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the
release of American hostages. No one has claimed to hold him.
Seventeen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are believed
held in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16,
1985.
   Waite's brother, David, said he hoped Penman was right about the
hostages' release, but warned ``the moment you start talking about
it being over by such and such a date, and that date passes, it is
a big anticlimax.''
   Mrs. Thatcher expressed hope for improved relations in a letter
to David Waite which was made public Saturday.
   Two London newspapers, The Independent and Daily Telegraph,
reported Monday that Penman was on a mission for Runcie, but Penman
said he was invited by the Iranians and the trip's primary purpose
was to discuss Iranian-Australian relations.
   Bishop John Brown, whose diocese includes Cyprus and all Persian
Gulf nations except Iran, went to Lebanon at Runcie's request last
week to speak to Lbanese Christian leaders about four Iranians who
disappeared while traveling in a Christian-controlled zone outside
Beirut in July 1982.
   They were presumed kidnapped, but no one claimed responsibility.
There have been unconfirmed reports that they were killed.
   Brown said Sunday that he hoped his mission contributed
``towards the overall picture which I hope will lead towards the
release of all the hostages.''
   The Foreign Office said Britain's review of relations with
Tehran follows Iran's acceptance of a U.N. resolution calling for a
cease-fire in Iran's 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   ``British ministers are reviewing the whole gamut of
Anglo-Iranian relations, including the possibility of sending a
diplomat to Tehran for a short period of time,'' said a Foreign
Office spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Britain and Iran all but broke off diplomatic relations last
summer after an Iranian envoy was arrested for shoplifting in
England and a British diplomat was arrested and beaten in Tehran.
   Britain left its mission in Tehran vacant, but Iran has kept its
charge d'affairs, Akunzadeh Basti, in London.
   Basti said Monday, following an hourlong meeting at the Foreign
Office, that ``a better atmosphere is developing.''

   Passengers said the pilot went on the
intercom to brag about the advanced electronic wizardry aboard
their 2-week-old Delta Air Lines jetliner. Minutes later, the plane
overshot a runway and wound up mired in the mud.
   None of the 87 passengers and six crew members was injured when
flight 278 from Atlanta ran out of runway during the Monday morning
landing at Pensacola Regional Airport, said airline and aviation
officials. The flight was to have continued to Baton Rouge, La.
   Passenger Kenneth H. Laraway of Atlanta said those aboard
remained calm when the plane came to a halt and many laughed when a
flight attendant said, ``Welcome to Pensacola.''
   ``A half hour later we are standing in line out here (to book
new flights to Baton Rouge), saying, `Yeah, it's got all these
digital readouts and whatnot, but the brakes still work the same
way, you've got to put your foot on the brake pedal,' '' Laraway
said.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta
said there was no immediate indication what caused the
McDonnell-Douglas twin-jet aircraft, an updated version of the
DC-9, to roll off the end of the runway, but he said the plane
``appeared to have landed late.''
   Passenger Cyril J. Turner of Atlanta, who said he usually flies
at least a couple of times every week, said the jetliner appeared
to be coming down faster than normal and the braking was sudden
when it touched down.
   ``I could feel that the pilot was trying to exert the brakes
with some urgency,'' Turner said. ``When I looked out the window
again we were approaching a grassy area. We didn't finally stop
until we hit that grass area.''
   The rear 15 or 20 feet of the plane remained over the end of the
runway, said Airport Director Frank Miller. The FAA and Delta were
investigating.
   Delta officials were interviewing the pilots Monday afternoon,
but the airline does not disclose identities of crew members, said
Jackie Pate, a Delta spokeswoman in Atlanta.
   She said she was unable to respond to comments by passengers
because the investigation was still under way.
   ``A lot of times passengers perceive things differently than
what actually has gone on,'' Ms. Pate said.
   The main runway was closed for nearly five hours while crews
removed the jetliner, but airport operations were unaffected as
aircraft were able to use another runway, Miller said. He said
there was no apparent damage and Delta was preparing to ferry the
plane back to Atlanta.

   Saudi Arabia wants to keep buying weapons from
the United States, although it also will build its stock with
purchases from elsewhere, the Saudi embassy said Monday.
   Seeking to dispel any notion of a U.S.-Saudi rift, the embassy
released a statement on the Saudi decision to buy $17 billion worth
of military equipment, including 50 Tornado jet fighters, from
Britain.
   ``The kingdom would like to reiterate its desire to obtain its
military requirements, including advanced aircraft and defense
arms, from American plants, with the full conviction of our
peaceful intentions..,'' the statement said. It was attributed to
an unnamed source who was quoted by the Saudi Press Agency.
   The State Department has complained that the deal was not in the
interest of the United States.
   For decades the Saudis relied mainly on the United States to
supply weapons, but supporters of Israel in Washington have blocked
the sale of some sophisticated weapons, claiming they could be used
against the Jewish state.
   The statement said the British sale ``will not affect, either in
the short-term or long-term the strength of ties between''
Washington and Riyadh.
   Although the Saudis will continue trying to secure weapons from
the United States, they will buy from any country as long as there
are no restrictions, the statement said.
   Last week, King Fahd said Saudi Arabia will not hesitate to
purchase weapons from communist suppliers.

   A bus packed with construction workers
jumped a highway divider and flipped over Monday on a highway in
northern Portugal, killing eight people and injuring 54 others,
police said.
   A police traffic brigade spokesman in the capital, Lisbon, said
the bus was carrying the workers to a construction site when it
crashed about nine miles outside Oporto. The official spoke on

   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the legal capacity of the
bus was 52 passengers but extra passengers reportedly were standing

   Earlier, police said at least 10 people were killed. Police gave
no explanation for the change in the death toll.
   The bus appeared to be traveling too fast, said Torquato Beira
Carvalho, a passenger quoted by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
   Some of the injured were thrown through the bus windows, while
others were trapped in the wreckage, the agency said.
   The bus was traveling from Oporto to Sao Joao de Madeira, about
20 miles south.

<TEXT>
   The 1984 presidential campaign committee of
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, has agreed to pay a $30,000 civil penalty
to settle alleged violations of federal election law, officials
said Monday.
   The Federal Election Commission said it had found probable cause
to believe that the Glenn committee and its treasurer, William R.
White, accepted excessive campaign contributions, misreported cash
and spending levels and exceeded spending limits.
   The information was made public in a voluntary ``conciliation
agreement'' between the agency and the committee that was released
by the FEC.
   The FEC charged that the Glenn committee accepted a total of
$81,326 in excessive campaign contributions and exceeded
presidential primary spending limits in Iowa by $149,439 and in New
Hampshire by $219,348.
   The agency said the committee apparently accepted excess
contributions from 126 individuals, seven partnerships and four
political committees. It said that while the committee issued
$51,676 in refunds and legally ``reattributed'' $30,025 to other
donors, the actions were not taken in a timely manner.
   The committee had argued that the law allows it to determine
whether a contribution is legal and gives it a ``reasonable time''
to refund any amounts exceeding the limit. It said it proceeded
with ``reasonable diligence'' in making that determination and
issued the refunds in a reasonable time.
   The FEC also charged that the committee understated spending and
overstated its cash on hand between April 1983 and March 1984 in
its reports to the FEC.

<HEAD>Police: Toll Taker Opened Her Own Lanes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Florida Turnpike toll booth
manager who opened her own lanes allegedly kept as much as $15,000
paid by motorists, a state transportation official said.
   Lorna J. Hoff, 33, was arrested April 2 after a stakeout by
Department of Transportation and state attorney's office
investigators at the Palm Beach Gardens Interchange. She had $844
and 750 toll tickets with her when she was stopped, authorities
said.
   According to Tim Valentine, a state attorney's investigator who
headed the operation, Ms. Hoff subsequently admitted to having
pilfered ``several hundred dollars'' worth of tolls on ``two or
three'' occasions following her promotion to manager March 4.
   Ms. Hoff's admission led to dismissal from her $17,394-a-year
job, and she was charged with grand theft.
   Her 10-year tenure with the DOT coupled with the fact that she
had no prior record led prosecutors to agree to drop the charge
when she agreed to pay back the $844 and take part in a pre-trial
intervention program.
   But the DOT refused to consent to the pre-trial deal, leaving
the grand theft charge standing. And DOT chief of toll facilities
John Berry now says she may have stolen as much as $15,000.
   Subsequent investigation into Hoff's activities has led the
state to believe the former toll manager may have milked a single
toll lane about 14 times, he said.
   ``We've been working reconstructing certain reports and
determined it's a lot more than $844,'' Berry said.
   Berry said evidence indicated that Hoff, who as manager was not
actually supposed to work a toll booth, had kept toll funds on days
she took regular attendants off the work schedule and put herself
on an operating lane.
   He said this was noticed because the regular attendants were
logged in for the day's work, but their end-of-day receipts were
not reported.

   Honda's luxury Acura cars ranked
highest in customer satisfaction for the second consecutive year in
a consumer survey that found only two American nameplates in the
top 10.
   The rankings released Monday by J.D. Power and Associates, an
auto industry research group, were based on questionnaires
completed by 25,200 motorists one year after they bought their cars.
   Ranked in order, the top 10 models were Acura, Mercedes-Benz,
Honda, Cadillac, Toyota, Lincoln, BMW, Volvo, and, tied for ninth,
Mazda and Audi.
   The survey covered 158 car models from 34 automakers and
measured customer satisfaction with both the product and with the
dealers that sell and service them.
   Acura, the luxury division of American Honda Motor Sales Co.
that sells two models, also placed first in the 1987 survey, the
first year it was included. Honda itself ranked third this year,
and Mercedes-Benz was second.
   Satisfaction with the industry overall improved in 1988, J.D.
Power and Associates said, attributing the improvement to increased
reliability of the cars and efforts to improve dealer service.
   Ranked by country of origin, Asian carmakers scored highest,
followed by European automakers, with the U.S. car industry ranked
last.
   J.D. Power, which conducts its survey primarily for sale to
automakers for their internal use, does not release survey results
on cars or automakers that rate poorly.
   Here is how the top 10 were rated in the survey in three
categories _ overall customer satisfaction, handling, and repair
and reliability. The numbers, derived from answers to the
questionnaires, have comparative meaning only.
   1. Acura, satisfaction 144; handling 141; reliability 131.
   2. Mercedes-Benz, satisfaction 138, handling 148, reliability
123.
   3. Honda, satisfaction 135, handling 125, reliability 132.
   4. Cadillac, satisfaction 126, handling 137, reliability 114.
   5. Toyota, satisfaction 122, handling 115, reliability 121.
   6. Lincoln, satisfaction 121, handling 125, reliability 113.
   7. BMW, satisfaction 120, handling 120, reliability 114.
   8. Volvo, satisfaction 118, handling 119, reliability 113.
   9. (tie) Mazda, satisfaction 117, handling 106, reliability 121.
   9. (tie) Audi, satisfaction 117, handling 131, reliability 108.

<TEXT>
   King Bhumibol Adulyadej opened the new
Parliament on Monday and is expected to name a 66-year-old former
general as prime minister.
   Elections were held July 24 for the 357-seat House of
Representatives and a five-party coalition was formed because none
of the 16 parties won a majority.
   A majority of the membership nominated Chatichai Choonhavan, the
former general who leads the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party, for a
four-year term as premier. The Chart Thai won more seats than any
other party.
   Last week, Chatichai gave the king a declaration signed by 215
members of Parliament who support him to become prime minister. The
king is expected to name Chatichai to the post this week through a
royal decree.
   Bhumibol will install Chatichai, who has been a deputy premier,
to replace Prem Tinsulanonda, 67, who resigned after serving for
eight years. Thailand is a parliamentart democracy and Bhumibol has
little direct power, but is the symbol of national unity.
   Prem, a former army commander, called the elections 24 months
early after disbanding his fractious coalition.
   Chatichai was left with no rival after Siddhi Savetsila, foreign
minister and leader of the Social Action Party, dropped out of the
running Sunday and said he would support Chatichai.
   The new prime minister is expected to follow a conservative,
pro-Western policy and emphasize economic development.

   President Reagan heard arguments Monday for
and against U.S. participation in a treaty aimed at freezing
emissions of an important precursor of acid rain.
   The pollutant in question, oxides of nitrogen, accounts for
about one-third of the acidity in rainfall in the eastern United
States and Canada.
   The Cabinet's Domestic Policy Council, with Reagan presiding,
was briefed on a proposal coming from a United Nations-sponsored
negotiation that would freeze emissions until 1996, pending further
research on the effects of nitrogen oxides and how to reduce them.
   Reagan made no decision, but participants expect one soon.
   Oxides of nitrogen are formed in the combustion of fossil fuels
in industry, utilities and motor vehicles. In the air they may be
transformed into nitric acid. In urban areas they are an essential
raw material for making smog.
   U.S. emissions have been roughly steady since 1980 and according
to EPA projections should remain that way until about 1995, when
slow increases should start. The 21.3 million tons emitted in 1986,
the most recent year available, were 8.5 percent below the peak
year of 1978.
   According to two participants in discussions over the issue,
both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, the Environmental
Protection Agency supports joining the treaty while the Energy
Department, supported by the Interior and Commerce departments and
the Office of Management and Budget, opposes it.
   EPA spokesmen declined to discuss their agency's participation
in the meeting. The telephone of an Energy Department official to
whom questions were referred did not answer.
   The United States in 1985 declined to join a similar
international agreement calling for a 30 percent reduction in
emissions of the other major precursor of acid rain, sulfur dioxide.

   Two men with pistols and grenades forced
an airliner to land on an abandoned runway Monday, where they
seized a gold shipment and robbed the 22 passengers, Medellin
police said.
   A police statement said the propeller-driven Twin Otter plane of
the Colombian airline ACES was on a flight from the northwest town
of El Bagre to the industrial city of Medellin when forced to land
near Campamento village, about 60 miles southwest of El Bagre.
   Six other gunmen joined the two hijackers and took the gold and
passengers' jewelry, money and other valuables, the statement said.
   The cargo of gold came from a mine near El Bagre and was valued
at $500,000, police said.
   The gunmen smashed the plane's radio, kicked the co-pilot in the
face, warned the pilot not to take off for an hour and then fled
into the jungle, police said.
   The plane took off from the grass runway after an hour and
landed safely in Medellin.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk went to North
Korea Monday after informing Chinese officials of the unfruitful
efforts to end the war in Cambodia.
   And a magazine said authorities in Bejing are refusing to allow
former Cambodia ruler Pol Pot to leave China, where the leader of
the Khmer Rouge regime is hospitalized for unspecified treatment.
   Sihanouk, who resigned last month as head of the Cambodian
resistance coalition, flew to North Korea for a ``short visit,''
the Korean Central News Agency reported in Pyongyang, North Korea's
capital. Sihanouk is to go to Tokyo Monday for a week.
   During his two-day visit to Beijing, Sihanouk told Chinese
leaders the prospects for peace in Cambodia were ``very slim.''
   He advised the Chinese about last week's talks in Indonesia that
involved Cambodia, Vietnam and the three-member Cambodian
resistance alliance made up of the radical communist Khmer Rouge,
anti-communist forces and Sihanouk's followers.
   Sihanouk did not participate in the talks but was represented by
his son.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the Khmer
Rouge and installed another communist regime. The Khmer Rouge then
began guerrilla warfare against the estimated 100,000 Vietnamese
troops in Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge, under Pol Pot, gained power in the spring of
1975 with the collapse of the U.S.-backed government. Hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians perished during the Khmer Rouge's harsh
efforts to turn Cambodia into a communist agrarian society.
   China backed the Khmer Rouge while the Soviet Union supports the
Vietnamese.
   Sihanouk met Sunday with Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, who said the
Indonesian meeting marked the beginning of a search for a political
settlement in Cambodia but accused Vietnam of being insincere.
   Upon his arrival in Beijing Saturday night, Sihanouk criticized
both Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge, the strongest member of the
resistance coalition.
   Vietnam has insisted that the Khmer Rouge must not be allowed to
return to power. China, although it had supported the Pol Pot
regime, has said Sihanouk should lead a future Cambodia government
that should not be dominated by the Khmer Rouge.
   In Hong Kong, the Chinese-language magazine Cheng Ming said
Chinese authorities will not allow Pol Pot to leave China. It said
Pol Pot is being treated at a Beijing hospital for unspecified
ailments.
   The magazine said China will offer political asylum to Pol Pot.
   It reported there was a tacit agreement between China and the
United States that China would stop supplying military aid to
groups loyal to Pol Pot and would not allow him to regain power in
Cambodia.
   Pol Pot officially retired in September 1985 as commander in
chief of the Khmer Rouge army and was named director of the party's
Institute for National Defense. The move was seen as an attempt by
the Khmer Rouge to improve its international image.
   Sihanouk was deposed by the military as Cambodia's head of state
in March 1970 and the monarchy was abolished that October.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Monday upheld the 1987
conviction of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., while a jury deliberated
racketeering charges against him in the Wedtech corruption trial.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley immediately
sequestered the jury in the Wedtech case at the request of Biaggi's
lawyer, who called the appeals court ruling ``a great problem for
us.''
   Motley had planned to sequester the jury beginning Tuesday night
after late arriving jurors on Monday were confronted by
demonstrators outside the courthouse, chanting ``Down with
political corruption'' and ``Compensate Wedtech workers.''
   The jury ended its third day of deliberations Monday without a
verdict.
   Monday's ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
Biaggi's Sept. 22, 1987, conviction for obstructing justice and
accepting an unlawful gratuity. Biaggi was convicted of accepting
free Florida vacations with a female companion from former Brooklyn
Democratic leader Meade Esposito.
   The appeals panel also upheld the conviction of the 80-year-old
Esposito.
   Biaggi, 71, a 10-term congressman from the Bronx, was convicted
by a U.S. District Court jury in Brooklyn on three felony counts:
accepting an illegal gratuity, traveling across state lines to
accept the gratuity and obstruction of justice.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein sentenced Biaggi to 30
months in prison and a $500,000 fine. Biaggi has been free pending
appeal, and his attorney James LaRossa said Biaggi would try to
pursue his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The original jury acquitted Biaggi and Esposito of the more
serious charges of bribery and conspiracy.
   Prosecutors said Esposito paid for one vacation and arranged to
pay for another in exchange for the congressman's efforts on behalf
of a Brooklyn ship repair company that was a major client of
Esposito's insurance brokerage.
   In the current trial, Biaggi and six defendants are charged with
turning the now-defunct Wedtech Corp. into a racketeering
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain
no-bid government contracts.
   The House ethics committee recommended in February 1988 that
Biaggi be expelled for ``criminal conduct ... going to the heart of
his representational responsibilities.'' In an unusual maneuver,
however, congressional leaders decided to delay action while Biaggi
defended himself in the Wedtech trial.
   John Davison, a spokesman for the ethics committee, declined to
comment on what effect the appeals court ruling would have.

<HEAD>Doctor Quits In Animal-To-Human Transplants Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British surgeon involved in a plan to use pigs'
organs for human transplants abruptly quit the project Monday in a
dispute with colleagues, but said research would continue.
   Dr. Michael Bewick said fellow researchers at Dulwich Hospital,
in south London, told him to ``shut up or get out'' following a day
where battle lines were drawn between scientists and animal rights
activists.
   Bewick, 52, a kidney transplant specialist, said the research
team was furious that without their consent he had announced the
hospital intended to study the feasibility of transplanting
kidneys, livers and hearts from pigs into people.
   Animal rights groups responded to the press coverage by labeling
the idea a ``horror fantasy'' and ``gross abuse of animal life.''
They asked the government to ban the project.
   Bewick said the research team feared the controversy might harm
its chances of obtaining facilities to carry out the work.
   ``For the sake of the group and the work they are doing, I
decided it would be right for me to leave,'' Bewick said. He
stressed the group had ``the brains and technical skills'' to
proceed without him.
   A hospital spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he would meet with Bewick and the research team Tuesday to assess
the situation.
   Bewick was quoted in the Independent newspaper Monday, as saying
in earlier comments that the program posed ``no ethical problem. .
.. Animal kidneys could save the lives of thousands of people who
die because we do not have an off-the-shelf kidney.''
   Before withdrawing from the project, Bewick had offered to meet
with animal rights groups to discuss their concerns. He said he
feared attacks on his personal property and the hospital.
   Attempts to transplant animal organs into humans, including
sheep, baboon and chimpanzee hearts, have failed.
   In what was probably the most publicized case, Dr. Leonard
Bailey transplanted a baboon heart into a 12-day-old infant, dubbed
Baby Fae, at the Loma Linda medical facility in California in 1984.
She died 20 days later.
   A year after the California baby's death, Bailey said she died
not from rejection of heart tissue but from another form of
rejection which he said he believes is possible to avoid.
   Bewick said over the weekend that the hospital research team
found a way to filter out antibodies that cause humans to reject
donor organs. He said the new technique had helped 20 patients
accept human kidneys more easily.
   Researchers had planned experiments this fall to see whether the
technique worked between different species of animals _ pigs and
sheep. If successful, Bewick had estimated pig-to-human transplants
could begin within three years.
   But the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection condemned
the research program as a ``gross abuse of animal life and waste of
health care resources.''
   ``The experimental animals will undoubtedly suffer greatly both
physically and mentally despite the fact that anesthetics will be
used,'' an unidentified spokesman said.
   Bewick had said pigs were the most suitable animals because
their organs physiologically most resemble those of humans.
   Another pressure group, Animal Concern Scotland, said animal
research would be unnecessary if more people agreed to donate their
organs after death.
   ``The idea of breeding pigs as living organ banks owes more to
sick horror fantasy than medical science'' said a spokesman, who
refused to be identified. ``I hope the (government) will use some
common sense and ban this approach.''
   The Sunday Times quoted Bewick as saying he had obtained
approval for the experiments from the hospital's ethics committee.
   A spokeswoman for the British Medical Association, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that panel's approval made the project
acceptable if it seemed likely to yield some benefit.
   She said society ultimately would decide the future of
animal-to-human transplants. The controversy highlighted the need
for a national ethics committee, she said.

   A preliminary FBI inquiry into allegations the
Dukakis administration gave developers confidential information
about prison-siting plans has ended with no charges filed.
   Law enforcement sources, speaking only on condition they not be
named, said the investigation turned up no evidence of federal
violations.
   FBI spokesman John Cloherty said, ``The FBI is conducting no
further investigation with regard to the placing of a state prison
at New Braintree, Mass., and-or the procurement of land for that
prison.'' He declined to characterize the outcome of the inquiry
other than to say no charges had been filed.
   Cloherty also declined to say whether any evidence had been
forwarded for grand jury review. However, two law enforcement
sources said the inquiry found no evidence that federal laws had
been broken.
   Stephen Crawford, deputy press spokesman for the Massachusetts
governor, refused to say whether law enforcement officials had
informed the administration that the inquiry had ended.
   But when told of the FBI statement and law enforcement comment,
Crawford said: ``It was always our contention that this was an open
process, above the board. We will go forward with the
implementation of the New Braintree plan.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis in 1986 formally announced plans to build a
500-bed, medium-security prison in New Braintree at the site of a
defunct religious academy. The site had been discussed informally
for a prison or other state institution beginning in 1984.
   Prison opponents, largely residents of the rural town of 800
people, complained that the inmate and staff population would
overrun their farming community. Later, some opponents alleged that
the Dukakis administration, unable to buy the land directly because
the church that owned it had agreed with town officials not to sell
it for projects including a prison, leaked its interest in the site
to two developers who bought it and then offered it to the state.
   The allegations have been cited by Dukakis critics to attack the
good-government pledges that are a major theme of his presidential
campaign. National publicity followed the FBI's confirmation June
23 that a preliminary inquiry was under way. At that time, the
agency said Dukakis himself was not a target of any investigation.
   The developers, Daniel Striar and Gary Jacobson, offered the
land to the state for $9.5 million. But the state has offered only
$5 million, citing three appraisals, commissioned by the state,
that listed its value at or just below $5 million.
   Striar and Jacobson have rejected the state's offer as too low
but the state notified New Braintree officials in a letter mailed
last week that the purchase would go forward.
   Jack Bradshaw, associate deputy commissioner of the state
Division of Capital Planning and Operations, said the state will
take the land by eminent domain if the owners do not change their
stance. The seizure likely will take place in mid-October or
November, he said Monday.
   Bradshaw said his agency had not been informed that the inquiry
had ended.
   ``None of my people were questioned as part of it and we haven't
talked to them today either,'' he said. ``We didn't feel it was
necessary for any investigation. However, the FBI has a role to
complete and if they have done that and feel there is no evidence
of wrongdoing then I'm certainly happy.''

   The Marine Corps has punished two
female Marines because they testified at a court-martial on behalf
of a female sergeant who was accused of lesbianism at Parris Island.
   And a specialist in military legal affairs said the action may
have damaged future efforts to prosecute female Marines accused of
lesbianism.
   Staff Sgts. Gloria H. Gurule and Christine R. Hilinski, who
testified as character witnesses at Sgt. Cheryl Jameson's
court-martial July 14, were removed from the drill field July 18
and reassigned to other areas.
   Also, their military occupational specialities were voided,
which means their permanent records will show they had an
unsuccessful tour of duty on the drill field. Ms. Hilsinki wasn't
actually assigned to the drill field when she was removed but was
on a routine six-month ``quota,'' in this case serving as a depot
inspector.
   Jameson pleaded guilty to engaging in indecent acts and charges
of sodomy and obstruction of justice were dropped. She was
sentenced to a year in prison, reduced to private and dishonorably
discharged.
   Air Force Maj. Carol DiBattiste said military judges could throw
out any more cases that go to trial if they believe the Corps tried
to frighten potential defense witnesses. Ms. DiBattiste is an
instructor in the military justice division at the Air Force Judge
Advocate General's School's at Maxwell Air Force Base.
   ``The problem is when you start trying to scare witnesses,''
said Ms. DiBattiste. ``If they can prove it ... the accused might
have a successful claim.''
   Attorneys charge that by removing the two women from their jobs,
and by holding ``informational briefings'' with other female
Marines to explain the actions, Corps officials have frightened
others from coming forward to testify for their clients.
   ``The word is out: You don't testify for women accused of being
a homosexual,'' said Vaughan Taylor, an attorney for several women
accused in the investigation.
   The Uniform Code of Military Justice, which governs all branches
of the military, prohibits illegal command influence, which
``involves anyone in a position of command who tries to influence
the outcome of a court-martial.''
   That section of the code has been interpreted by the U.S. Court
of Military Appeals to mean, for example, that commanders can't try
to persuade potential witnesses not to testify, according to court
opinions.
   But Parris Island officials, who acknowledge punishing the women
for their testimony but don't acknowledge holding the briefings,
said they've done nothing improper or illegal.
   A spokesman for the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot at
Parris Island, 1st Lt. A.J. Kozloski, said the women were relieved
of their duties as drill instructors because of their testimony.
   ``They were relieved as a result of loss of confidence by thir
superiors based on the content of their testimony under oath in the
Jameson case,'' Kozloski said. ``This is purely an administrative
action. No one is being punished merely for testifying.
   Gurule and Hilinski testified they would be willing to work with
Ms. Jameson.
   ``The fact is that if a Marine in a position of high
responsibility such as a drill instructor makes a statement under
oath that (shows) he or she doesn't understand or support an order
directly governing his or her duties, it is within the discretion
of the commander to consider removing that individual from that
specific postion.''
   Ms. DiBattiste said that although officers could be
court-martialed if found guilty of engaging in illegal command
influence, such charges are usually dropped.
   ``All I can tell you is I think that's an appropriate allegation
for defense council to make,'' Ms. DiBattiste said. ``I would not
render an opinion to you whether they would win or lose.''

<HEAD>FEC Asks Court To Reject GOP Claim On Dukakis-Bentsen Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission on Monday
asked a federal appeals court to reject a Republican claim that
full funding for the Democratic presidential campaign should be
blocked because Sen. Lloyd Bentsen was benefiting unfairly.
   The Republicans fail to show there is anything illegal about
Bentsen's decision to run for both the vice presidency and
re-election to his Senate seat, as allowed under Texas law, the FEC
said.
   Blocking the Democrats from spending their federal money would
``irreparably harm'' their campaign, the FEC said.
   Bentsen's Senate campaign opponent, Republican Rep. Beau
Boulter, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which
helps GOP Senate candidates win election, complained that the dual
campaign gave Bentsen an unfair financial advantage.
   Because of the dual campaign, Bentsen would be able to spend the
$4 million in private money raised for his Senate contest on top of
the federal money for his vice presidential campaign, which is
limited for both parties.
   The committee asked the FEC to withhold the $46 million in
federal funding due the Michael Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, but the
commission two weeks ago voted 6-0 to reject that request. The
money was then transferred from the Treasury to the campaign.
   The GOP is now asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia to block the Democrats from spending the money.
   Bentsen's attorneys also filed a brief on Monday asking that the
GOP request be rejected.

<HEAD>Government Ordered To Change Or Delete Unconstitutionally Vague
Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered the government to
change or delete unconstitutionally vague language in pledges
signed by 1.7 million government workers not to disclose top-secret
information.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch ordered the modification in the
non-disclosure pledges signed by government workers with access to
top-secret information must sign to retain their security
clearances.
   In an order signed Friday and made public Monday, the judge said
the government must provide a more specific definition of the term
``classifiable information.''
   In signing the various pledges, government employees promise not
to make unauthorized disclosures of top-secret information or
``classifiable information.''
   Gasch gave the Information Security Oversight Office 60 days to
notify the federal employees of the government's definition or
``classifiable information'' or to declare the term inoperative.
   Until that notification is made, the government cannot penalize
employees who disclose ``classifiable information,'' the judge said.
   A more specific definition must also be included in forms
presented to federal employees who have not yet signed the pledge
or the term must be deleted, the judge said.
   The ruling was made in a lawsuit by two federal employees unions
that contended the pledges use throughout the executive branch
empowered government agencies to penalize whistleblowers by
classifying information after it was disclosed to the press or
members of Congress.
   Gasch suggested that the security agency, headed by Steven
Garfinkel, could adopt a definition published late last year in the
Federal Register.
   That regulation defined ``classifiable information'' as any
unstamped material or oral conversations that an employee has a
good reason to know should be classified.
   Such information would include material that was in the process
of being reviewed for classification, according to the regulatory
definition published Dec. 21, 1987.
   Gasch upheld the validity of that definition, saying: ``much
classified information is not marked as such because it has not
been examined by a classification authority. The govenrment
nevertheless has a substantial interest in safeguarding that
information.''
   The 1987 definition ``simply requires that employees consider
whether they have reason to believe that unmarked information is
classified or should be classified and is in the process of
becoming so,'' Gasch said.
   The regulation was offered to allay concerns raised by the
plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit.
   But Gasch said that ``until an employee becomes aware of the
regulatory definition, he cannot know what `classifiable'
information does not include, for example, information that only
speculation suggests will become classified.''
   ``Notice of the definition is essential,'' the judge said.
   The decision was hailed by both sides of the dispute.
   Garfinkel noted that Gasch had upheld the general principle that
federal employees can be required to sign secrecy pledges.
   ``I think essentially its a victory for the broader principle.
It will require us to do something more as far as the forms that
hae already been signed is concerned,'' Garfinkel said. ``We will
have to decide which option to take.''
   Patti Goldman, an attorney for Public Citizen Litigation Group,
a consumer lobby that filed a friend-of-the-court brief for several
members of Congress, said the order ``teaches a lesson to the
government that they have to be more careful when they are crafting
these agreements.''

<HEAD>Israel Expels Eight Palestinians, Strike Hits Occupied Lands</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with color on deportations, defense

   The army on Monday deported to Lebanon eight
Palestinians accused of inciting the 8-month-old uprising in the
occupied lands, where a two-day general strike was launched to
protest Israel's policy of expulsions.
   Security sources said six more Palestinians were handed
deportation orders under emergency regulations enacted by Israel in
August 1985, but defense officials denied the report.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, troops wounded two Palestinian
youths, including a 12-year-old boy shot in the neck, after masked
protesters stoned the soldiers' jeep, officials at Al Ittihad
Hospital said.
   The hospital and defense officials spoke on condition of
anonymity, as did the security sources.
   The deportations brought to 29 the number of Palestinians
banished since the insurrection began on Dec. 8 in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war. The insurrection has killed 235 Palestinians
and four Israelis.
   The deportees were visited by their families at Jneid prison
near Nablus hours before being expelled. Relatives said they
watched the men being driven away in unmarked cars, the windows
blocked by newspapers and plastic bags.
   Israel television said an army helicopter took the deportees to
southern Lebanon, where they were placed in waiting taxis after
being giving a medical checkup and offered $50 each. Only three
accepted the money, the report said.
   Television segments showed one man flashing a victory sign as he
climbed into the taxi.
   An army spokesman said the eight were senior activists in
guerrilla organizations and accused them of ``inciteful and
subversive activities.''
   Among the deportees was a journalist with Jerusalem's
Arabic-language Al Fajr newspaper, Loui Ali Nafeh Abdu, who was
accused of being a senior activist in the Palestine Liberation
Organization in Nablus.
   Others included a Bir Zeit University lecturer and a labor
leader from El Bireh.
   Al Fajr managing editor Maher Abukhater denounced the
deportations as ``an extreme form of punishment and obvious
violation of basic human rights.'' The U.S. administration also has
criticized the policy.
   A leaflet circulated on July 21 called for a Monday-Tuesday
strike to protest such deportations.
   Palestinians meanwhile painted graffiti on walls denouncing
Jordan's King Hussein for announcing plans to sever ties with the
850,000 Palestinians in the West Bank. ``Down with Hussein the
traitor,'' read one slogan in Tulkarem.
   Other Palestinians praised the move.
   ``It should start the ball rolling in the direction of working
out strategic relationships between the PLO and Jordan on the
future,'' Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab of the Nazareth daily
A-Sinara told Israel radio.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Hussein ``dealt a blow'' to
the idea of a Palestinian state by differentiating between
Palestinians living on the east bank of the Jordan River and those
in the West Bank.
   ``If, as Hussein says, one part of them has to set up a
Palestinian state and another part is Jordanian ... where then is
the one Palestinian people?,'' an aide quoted Shamir as saying in a
meeting with New Zealand's new ambassador.
   ``It is possible to draw the conclusion that the whole idea of a
Palestinian people is an invention for the sake of propaganda.''
   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes territorial concessions
to the Arabs.
   A government official disclosed Monday that Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres tried through foreign intermediaries to persuade
Hussein not to cut legal and administrative links with the West
Bank.
   The decision was a setback for Peres' Labor Party, which
proposed resolving the dispute with the Palestinians by negotiating
with Jordan.
   Peres told Israel television on Monday that Israeli elections
here this November ``will determine if the Jordanian option is dead
or not.''
   Also Monday, the Israeli Peace Now movement appealed to the
United States and three other Western countries to obtain the
release of Faisal Husseini, a prominent pro-PLO activist jailed
Sunday for six months without trial.
   ``The only chance to make peace is with the Palestinian
leadership. When one appears, they (Israeli authorities) cut him
down,'' said Peace Now spokesman Avishai Margalit.
   Attorney General Yosef Harish decided on Monday to put Jewish
settler leader Pinhas Wallerstein on trial in the Jan. 11 shooting
death of a West Bank Palestinian, Israel television said.
   According to initial army reports, Wallerstein fired in
self-defense after being stoned by Palestinians, but Palestinian
witnesses said 17-year-old Nasser Ghanem Hammad was killed without
provocation.

<TEXT>
   Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams was
arrested and led away from Atlanta's City Hall in handcuffs Monday
on a 5-month-old weapons charge stemming from an incident at
Hartsfield airport.
   Williams was held briefly at the jail in neighboring Clayton
County, where Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport is located,
then released on his own recognizance.
   His arrest by Clayton County Sheriff Bill Lemacks came about two
hours after a news conference during which he said he had never
been notified of the charges against him.
   He was indicted last week by a Clayton County grand jury on one
count of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon.
   Williams was stopped March 6 at a security checkpoint at
Hartsfield as he tried to board a plane. Police said they found a
.38-caliber handgun and five bullets inside his briefcase.
   According to police, Williams said he had placed the gun in his
briefcase while cleaning his car and forgot it was there when he
dashed to the airport.
   Williams was given a copy of the charges and allowed to board
the plane after his handgun and ammunition were confiscated.
   Williams first was charged with two misdemeanor counts _
carrying a weapon without a license and carrying a concealed
weapon. The charges was upgraded to a single felony count after a
review of Williams' criminal record, said Stanley Tuggle, chief of
administrative operations for the Clayton County Sheriff's
Department.
   If found guilty, Williams could face one to five years in jail.
   Williams has been arrested numerous times during his work for
civil rights, and also has at least 25 traffic-related convictions.
   At his news conference, Williams denied reports that he had
promised to surrender over the weekend.
   ``The racist white press of Atlanta is again out to destroy my
image as a black leader who is unbought and unbossed,'' he said.
   Tuggle had been quoted over the weekend as saying, ``We have
been in contact with Mr. Williams and he has indicated he will turn
himself in.''
   Tuggle said Monday that Clayton County authorities had contacted
Williams indirectly last week through the Fulton County Sheriff's
Department, and that Williams had told those officers he would
handle the matter over the weekend.
   ``He is being truthful when he says he didn't talk directly with
us, but he's not being truthful when he says he didn't know
anything about it,'' Tuggle said. ``He knew what was going on.''

   A Soviet official said Monday there is a good
chance four-way talks that resume Tuesday will produce a peace
settlement soon in southern Africa.
   Anatoly Adamyshin, Soviet deputy foreign minister, made the
comments after two days of consultations with Chester Crocker, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for African affairs.
   Crocker is mediating the talks among South Africa, Angola and
Cuba, which began three months ago and resume Tuesday. Agreement on
guidelines for a settlement was reached during last month's round
in New York.
   ``We think there are chances of success in these negotiations,''
Adamyshin told a news conference. ``It appears that all sides are
serious about seeking a settlement. ... It is possible that there
will be a settlement in the nearest future.''
   Asked to be more specific, he said a target date of Sept. 29 had
been mentioned. That is the 10th anniversary of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 435 on independence for Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa, which South Africa has controlled since World
War I.
   All negotiators accepted the resolution as a basis of the
``Principles for a Peaceful Settlement in Southwestern Africa''
agreed upon July 20.
   The list of 14 principles, the first document to which the three
countries have agreed, link independence for Namibia to withdrawal
of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola.
   Cuban soldiers have helped the Marxist government against rebels
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA, who have fought since Angola became independent of Portugal
in 1975. The movement, led by Jonas Savimbi, is supported by South
Africa and the United States.
   The agreement on principles emerged from three rounds of talks
held since May in London, Cairo and New York. Military commanders
of South Africa, Angola and Cuba met in Cape Verde and were said to
have made progress on disengaging Cuban and South African soldiers
who face each other along the Angola-Namibia frontier.
   Crocker has called the list of principles ``an important step''
but says hard bargaining remains. The Soviet Union has assigned a
special observer, although it is not a participant in the
negotiations.
   Adamyshin was asked about a U.S. official's statement that the
superpowers find increasing common ground on southern Africa, and
acknowledged there is ``more understanding.''
   He added, however, that U.S. military aid to UNITA ``is unlawful
and must be stopped. On that point, we differ with the United
States.''
   Later in the news conference, he said the aid issue must be
settled between the United States and Angola. It is not covered in
the list of principles.
   According to Adamyshin, the Soviet Union ``will be satisfied
with whatever satisfies Angola, Cuba, and SWAPO.''
   SWAPO, or the South-West Africa People's Organization, has
fought a guerrilla war in Namibia since 1966, when the United
Nations abrogated a League of Nations mandate under which South
Africa governed the former German colony.
   It has welcomed the agreement on principles and a SWAPO
spokesman described prospects for a settlement as ``reasonably
brighter.''
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba said last week the parties were
on the ``threshhold of a political solution.''
   South Africa has been more cautious. Its government radio said
Monday recent Cuban reinforcements and deployment of Angolan and
Cuban soldiers on the Namibian border ``place a question mark over
the real intentions'' of the two governments.

   The PLO foreign relations chief was quoted
as calling on Monday for maintaining Palestinian rights in Jordan
following King Hussein's decision to cut administrative ties with
Palestinians in the West Bank.
   Farouk Kaddoumi made his comments Monday at a closed meeting of
the Central Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
according to other PLO officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The council is the upper branch of the PLO's bicameral
legislature, the Palestine National Council.
   Kaddoumi praised Jordan's ``distinguished'' relations with the
world's 5 million Palestinians and the PLO and said, ``These
relations will remain,'' the PLO officials reported.
   But they said Kaddoumi emphasized the importance of maintaining
``all the rights acquired by the Palestinian people in Jordan.''
   Hussein over the past week suspended Jordan's Parliament, half
of whose members were Palestinians, and canceled a development plan
for the Israeli-occupied West Bank to dramatize PLO responsibility
for the occupied lands.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   PLO officials said Chairman Yasser Arafat ordered a muzzle on
all public comments by his organization about Hussein's move until
the PLO Executive Committee _ the equivalent of a Cabinet _ has
time to study it.
   Hussein's actions appeared to please several of the Central
Council members who spoke to reporters. But PLO officials said
Arafat canceled a trip planned to the Jordanian capital next week.
The trip had never been formally announced.
   Jordan is a lifeline for the 850,000 Palestinians in the West
Bank, most of whom carry Jordanian passports, use Jordanian money
and worship in Jordanian-supported mosques. More than half of
Jordan's own people are refugees or immigrants from Palestine and
the king's action has fueled rumors about a posible loss of some
rights.
   Kaddoumi also was quoted as saying that support for the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories by some Arab
governments was ``below required levels.'' He also accused Syria of
undermining the insurrection by sponsoring attacks by PLO dissident
factions on Beirut refugee camps held by Arafat loyalists, PLO
officials reported.
   ``Syria's role in the attacks against Palestinian camps is clear
as the sun itself,'' Kaddoumi was quoted as saying.
   ``If they are really after strategic parity (with Israel), they
should have dropped their anti-PLO policies, especially during the
uprising.''
   The PLO officials said Kaddoumi took a swipe at Arafat's chief
spokesman, Bassam Abu Sharif, for publishing a moderately phrased
newspaper article urging Arab-Israeli coexistence.
   ``Political initiatives should not flout the resolutions and
declared policy of the PLO,'' Kaddoumi was quoted as saying.
   ``All personal interpretations or judgments by any of the
organization's officials or responsible cadres should adhere to the
declared national objectives.''
   The Central Council extended its sessions into Tuesday. It had
been scheduled to end its meetings Monday night.

   The International Press Institute on Monday urged
the Burmese government to free Associated Press correspondent Sein
Win, who was arrested last week along with 10 dissidents.
   The arrests were made Friday and Saturday by the government of
Burma's new leader, former Gen. Sein Lwin.
   IPI, which has a worldwide membership of about 2,000
journalists, editors and publishers, protested Sein Win's detention
in a letter to Sein Lwin, said Peter Galliner, director of the
institute.
   He said the letter ``strongly urges the immediate release'' of
Sein Win, 66, a Burmese national.
   Burma on Monday released the names of 10 men it said were
arrested ``to prevent an attack against the state'' but Sein Win's
name was not on the list. The govenment has made no public mention
of Sein Win's detention.
   The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon reportedly made an official inquiry
Monday into the status of the AP correspondent.
   Sein Win, who is married and has four children, has worked for
AP for two decades and is a former publisher of the
English-language Rangoon newspaper The Guardian. He was jailed for
three years in the 1960s, along with thousands of other political
prisoners.

<HEAD>EPA Wants Government to Get Profits From Cuts in Chemical
Production</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS one graf after 2nd graf bgng ``But the agency ... ''

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Monday it wants the government to capture expected windfall
corporate profits that could reach $7 billion during future cuts in
production of chemicals that destroy the Earth's protective ozone
layer.
   But the agency said it had not decided how to do that, and one
major producer said it doubts that there will be major windfalls as
the chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbon or CFC compounds _ are cut back.
   Under EPA's expectations, the shortage of CFC compounds will
enable producers to raise prices with no increase in production
costs.
   EPA disclosed that it was considering regulations that could
require manufacturers to pay fees to the government equal to their
extra profits; could require recycling or other controls on
manufacturing processes; or could require companies to buy
manufacturing rights from the government at auctions open to anyone.
   The agency announced final adoption of detailed regulations,
including production quotas, to carry out last year's treaty
obliging major nations to cut CFC production 50 percent by 1998.
   EPA expects enough countries to ratify the treaty for it to take
effect next Jan. 1. Eleven nations accounting for two-thirds of
world production must ratify; six including the United States have
done so.
   Eileen Claussen, acting deputy EPA administrator for air
programs, said the agency leans toward fees, perhaps supplemented
by direct controls, as a way of capturing windfall profits. The
president's Office of Management and Budget, on the other hand,
favors auctioning the production rights.
   EPA's authority to proceed without legislation is cloudy, Ms.
Claussen said.
   An auction, she said, could be administratively unworkable if
10,000 small companies participate. ``If it was judged to be
illegal, we would have nothing. We wouldn't be in compliance with
the Montreal protocol,'' she said.
   And she said, ``There's a lot of concern about hoarding,'' in
which large companies like auto manufacturers would keep smaller
concerns, such as those making plastic foams for furniture
cushions, from getting production rights.
   EPA wants to the government to get the increased profits because
``our concern is the incentive producers might have for keeping an
existing product in production,'' delaying the switch to
environmentally harmless alternatives, said John Hoffman, project
officer for the regulations.
   The largest producer of CFCs, Du Pont Co., said it believed no
action was needed to take extra profits away from the producers
because they would be small or nonexistent.
   ``One producer after another is announcing progress with
substitutes,'' said Joe Steed, environmental manager for CFCs for
Du Pont. Substitution ``is the driving force we're going to see ...
if we can fund development at the rate we think we need, we'll be
doing well.''
   EPA said the increase in profits over the 1986 level could range
from $1.8 billion if user companies rapidly find alternatives to
$7.2 billion if CFC compounds are kept on the market as long as
possible.
   The Montreal treaty binds participating countries to a reduction
of 20 percent in CFC production in 1993 and a further 30 percent
cut in 1998, all calculated from a 1986 base.
   The long-lived CFC compounds ascend to the ozone layer 15 to 25
miles high, where since about 1960 they have destroyed about 2.5
percent of the ozone protecting humans from skin cancer from the
sun's ultra-violet rays normally blocked by ozone.
   EPA estimates that every percent decrease in ozone results on
43,000 additional skin cancer cases in the United States. Currently
there are about 500,000 cases a year.
   The regulation will prevent about 3.7 million early deaths among
people now alive in the United States or to be born by the year
2075, EPA estimated.
   Financially, ``The impact on the consumer will be very small,''
because CFC use is such a small part of the cost of production, and
large price increases will be easily absorbed even if the increase
is five- or six-fold, EPA's Hoffman said.
   CFCs are widely used as refrigeration fluids, solvents and
plastic foam blowing agents. They are banned as U.S. aerosol
propellants but still used as propellants abroad. A new car
typically contains 2.5 pounds of a CFC compound used as air
conditioning fluid, costing about $1.50.
   EPA's regulations, if triggered by the treaty going into effect,
mean that in the 12 months beginning July 1, 1989, the five U.S.
manufacturers will be bound by these manufacturing quotas, to the
nearest million pounds: Du Pont Co., 336 million pounds;
Allied-Signal Corp., 171 million; Pennwalt Corp., 86 million;
Kaiser Chemicals Co., 62 million and Racon Inc., 30 million.
   Similar quotas apply separately to the sum of production plus
imports minus exports: Du Pont, 308 million pounds, Allied-Signal,
163 million; Pennwalt, 84 million; Kaiser, 61 million; Racon, 30
million and 10 companies whose imports totaled almost 13 million
pounds.
   Related compounds called halons used in fire extinguishers will
be subject to similar quotas starting in 1992.
   The companies may transfer these quotas among themselves.

<TEXT>
   A paraplegic in a wheelchair, carrying fireworks
and samurai swords, lowered himself on a rope Monday from the
Brooklyn Bridge and dangled 75 feet above the East River for more
than an hour.
   Ramond Masa, 40, of the Bronx, who called himself ``America's
No. 1 Stuntman,'' claimed he had dangled from the 105-year-old
landmark for seven hours.
   His stunt forced traffic on the bridge to be halted as the
morning rush hour began. About 30 officers from the police harbor
unit, emergency service officers and ambulance personnel rushed to
the bridge, which connects lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, after a
tugboat operator spotted Masa.
   He was eventually persuaded to lower himself to the river, where
he was guided onto a police launch.
   Masa said he did it because ``I wanted to inspire these guys (in
wheelchairs) to get up from the hospital, and do something for
their communities and their families.''
   He refused medical attention at New York Infirmary-Beekman
Downtown Hospital and was taken to a police station, where he was
booked on charges of disorderly conduct, unlawful carrying of a
knife, and unlawful dealing with fireworks, according to police
spokesman Sgt. John Clifford.
   Masa, a large man with huge biceps and broad shoulders who also
uses the name El-Shah Muhammed El-Ratuli, was given a summons for a
Sept. 19 court date and released.
   The man, whose legs are paralyzed, initially told reporters his
name was ``Megaman.'' He handed out red, white and blue business
cards that proclaimed, ``Living on the edge is my business _
American No. 1 Stuntmen.''
   Masa said he lost the use of his legs when he was shot by a
sniper in 1977. He said his dangle off the Brooklyn Bridge was his
first experience as a stuntman.
   ``I planned for three months to do something real crazy to get
into the Guinness record book,'' he said. After a short vacation,
Masa said he plans to ``hang on the Statue of Liberty or the World
Trade Center. Maybe I'll take a shot at the Eiffel Tower in
France.''
   Masa said he was dropped off in the center of the span at about
midnight by his brother, whom he refused to identify.
   Dragging his wheelchair and two nylon bags containing the swords
and firecrackers behind him, Masa crawled to the edge of the span,
where he tied a nylon cord around his waist, through the wheelchair
and secured it to a five-inch thick piece of bridgework. Then, he
pushed the wheelchair off the bridge and shimmied down the rope
after it.
   He was noticed by a passing tugboat, which notified police about
dawn.
   ``He had looped it in some way that he could go down the rope
sitting in a wheelchair,'' said police Capt. William Plackenmeyer.
   Masa said he had planned to don a Ninja costume, light the six
super M-80's _ the equivalent of about 1{ sticks of dynamite _ and
hold the two samurai swords, each about three feet long, before he
jumped into the East River.
   He abandoned that plan after the two nylon bags containing his
gear fell into the river during the rescue effort.
   Masa expressed no remorse over the traffic jam. ``This is New
York. They (the commuters) like the excitement on Monday morning.''

   U.S Secretary of State George P. Shultz
and four Central American foreign ministers issued a joint
declaration Monday calling for peace and democracy in the region
but without mentioning Nicaragua.
   Shultz, however, used a closing news conference to take several
verbal swipes at Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and to
put in a plug for congressional approval of additional aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   Nicaragua was not invited to the meeting.
   The joint communique, issued at the end of a three-hour meeting,
was a watered-down version of an earlier declaration drafted
shortly after Shultz's last visit to Costa Rica, Honduras,
Guatemala and El Salvador in late June.
   Honduras said Sunday that Guatemala and Costa Rica had demanded
changes in the proposed communique.
   The initial draft was said to be 10 pages long and to contain a
harsh criticism of Nicaragua for its failure to live up to a
Central American peace agreement signed by it and its four
neighbors a year ago.
   But as issued, the declaration contained only 10 paragraphs,
reafirming the respect of the five countries ``for peace,
democracy, security, social justice and economic development'' in
all of Central America. While obviously aimed at Nicaragua, it did
not mention the country by name.
   The final version also said the United States and the four
Central American nations agreed on the need to establish
``authentic democratic governments in the entire region as
indispensable for peace.''
   It said the five countries ``reafirmed that authentic democracy
requires, among other requisites, political pluralism, freedom of
association, freedom of the press, an impartial justice system that
guarantees due process, an apolitical armed forces, an honest and
open electoral system and respect for human and individual rights.''
   At a news conference closing their meeting, Shultz said the
Contras ``are an important element, expressing a strong desire for
freedom and democracy in Nicaragua and we continue to support them.
   ``I didn't come here basically to discuss that subject, and we
didn't have very much discussion of it, although I certainly hope
that we will extend funding for the Contras,'' Shultz said. ``I
think it is very important.''
   Shultz said his discussions with the foreign ministers centered
on economic development ``and how we might organize ourselves to
pursue that more systematically.''
   Upon arriving in Guatemala, Shultz said the United States,
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica shared common goals
of democracy, the rule of law and economic progress. But he
acknowledged problems in reaching those objectives.
   Shultz spoke with reporters before meeting with Guatemalan
President Vinicio Cerezo and later with the four foreign ministers.
   He contrasted what he described as democracy and growing
prosperity in the four Central American nations with Nicaragua,
where he said nine years of Sandinista rule and continuing warfare
have virtually destroyed the economy.
   The United States has backed the Contras since 1981 in their
fight to overthrow the Sandinista government.
   In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega said Shultz was trying to
escalate action against his govermment.
   Speaking at a ceremony marking the ninth anniversary of the
Sandinista air force Monday, Ortega said of the meeting:
   ``We hope that common sense might predominate, because to want
to sign a death sentence against Nicaragua, because the United
States wants one, would be the equivalent of signing a death
sentence against Central America.''
   ``We hope that these (Central American) governments might be
sufficiently reasonable and pragmatic so as not to fall in the trap
that the United States is laying in Guatemala,'' he added.
   The meetings in Guatemala were part of Shultz's quest for a
united effort to isolate Nicaragua politically and economically
from its Central American neighbors.
   In a statement distributed to reporters in Guatemala City
Sunday, the Honduran government said it found the demand for draft
changes by Guatemala and Costa Rica ``incomprehensible'' and
``strange'' and that the softening of its contents were at the
insistence of those two countries.
   Eliminated from the original statement, the Hondurans said, were
sections that would have:
   _Criticized Nicaragua for not separating its army, known as the
Sandinista Popular Army, from the governing political party.
   _Denounced ``subversion against democratic governments'' by
Nicaragua.
   _Called for a regional security system and continued
consultation between the United States and the four Central
American nations.
   Shultz said in Washington Sunday that the original document had
been drafted ``mostly ... by the Central American foreign
ministers, not by us. Having drafted it, they were not so sure they
wanted to issue it.''
   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who won the 1987 Nobel
Peace Prize for designing and promoting the peace plan signed last
Aug. 7, has promised his own progress report soon and there was
speculation that his government decided the Guatemala declaration
might undercut Arias' review.
   Guatemala, unlike Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras, does not
share a common border with Nicaragua and pursues what it calls a
policy of ``active neutrality.''
   Shultz was to fly on to Argentina Monday night for his second
stop on a 10-day trip that will take him to nine Latin American
nations. He will return to Central America Aug. 8-9 for meetings
with the presidents of Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John Dearden, who led the Roman Catholic
archdiocese of Detroit for 22 years and was an important voice for
church reform, died Monday at the age of 80.
   Dearden died of pancreatic cancer at Providence Hospital, where
he had been hospitalized since July 22.
   ``This good and holy priest, archbishop and cardinal of the
church, will be mourned by Catholics of the Archdiocese of Detroit,
this country and throughout the world,'' said Cardinal Edmund
Szoka, the archbishop of Detroit.
   Dearden, who headed the archdiocese from 1959 to 1981, voted in
the election of two popes and played a major role in the Second
Vatican Council, which from 1962-65 launched extensive reforms in
the church, including departure from the Latin Mass, greater
emphasis on laymen's roles and fostering greater unity among all
Christians.
   Dearden retired as archbishop in 1980 after suffering a heart
attack but continued to administer the diocese until May 1981, when
he was succeeded by Szoka, who was elevated in June to cardinal.
   Dearden cited health reasons and age for retiring as spiritual
leader of the 1.2 million-member archdiocese. He remained active,
however, in the College of Cardinals.
   Dearden last was seen in public May 31 at Sacred Heart Seminary
in Detroit for a Mass in honor of his 40th anniversary as a bishop.
At the time he looked pale and frail and delivered the sermon from
a chair on the altar.
   ``We give him back to God, secure in our faith that he has been
welcomed into the kingdom of our heavenly father. There with Jesus,
Mary, the mother of God, and all the apostles in whose footsteps he
followed, he will have joy and life forever,'' Szoka said.
   Dearden, a Rhode Island native, was raised in Cleveland. He
became a priest in 1932 and served as a bishop in Pittsburgh before
coming to Detroit.
   He founded the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and was
its president from 1966-71. The conference worked to adopt Vatican
II philosophies in the United States and currently addresses
social, political and economic issues within the context of
Christian principles.
   Dearden was named a cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1969 and
participated in the voting for popes John Paul I and II in 1978.
   Dearden will lie in state at the Cathedral of Most Blessed
Sacrament Wednesday until Friday, when burial is scheduled at Holy
Sepulcher Cemetery.
   He is survived by brothers Ted and Greg of Cleveland and a
number of nieces and nephews.

   An explosion demolished a dormitory at a British
army barracks while the men were sleeping Monday morning, killing
one soldier and wounding nine. The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility.
   It was the fifth attack attributed to the IRA since May on
British military targets outside Northern Irland.
   Archie Hamilton, the armed forces minister, said after touring
the scene: ``It seems very likely it was a bomb. ... This makes it
an extremely cowardly attack, if that is what it was, by the IRA.''
   Scotland Yard said police had not determined whether a bomb
caused the explosion. British Gas experts said they could find no
sign of a gas leak or accidental cause.
   The blast at 7 a.m. at the Inglis barracks, a military mail
depot in suburban Mill Hill, knocked down most of the two-story
brick dormitory and started a fire.
   Two men were seriously injured and one was under intensive care,
hospital spokesmen said.
   Soldiers and firefighters dug trapped soldiers out of the
debris. One survivor, buried for half an hour, was saved by a
radiator that fell across his chest and became a shield.
   The dead soldier was identified as Michael Robbins, 23, a lance
corporal in the Royal Engineers. Earlier his last name had been
given as Robbin.
   Inglis is one of hundreds of small, lightly guarded army bases
in Britain and the attack raised fears of assaults on others. It is
on the edge of Finchley, the parliamentary constituency of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   IRA attacks have taken the lives of 16 British servicemen this
year in Britain and abroad, compared with only three in all of
1987. The apparent objective is to create public outrage that will
pressure Britain into leaving Northern Ireland.
   An IRA claim of responsibility was delivered to the British
domestic news agency Press Association in Belfast, Northern
Ireland. The guerrilla movement, most of whose members are Roman
Catholic, is trying to drive the British from the
Protestant-dominated province and unite it with the Irish Republic.
   Hamilton promised a security review of military installations in
Britain and abroad.
   Mrs. Thatcher said in Australia, where she was on an official
visit: ``I have sent a message to say I am very distressed and I
anxiously await further news.''
   The 15 men living in the dormitory were in bed when the
explosion tore out the main floor, an army spokesman said. The
building can accommodate 70.
   ``In the middle it just demolished it like a pack of cards,''
said Frank McParland, a construction worker at the barracks.
   The Defense Ministry said Inglis housed the Post and Courier
Depot, with a staff of 250, and personnel from the Royal Engineers,
Royal Navy and Women's Royal Army Corps.
   It was the first fatal attack attributed to the IRA in mainland
Britain since guerrillas planted a bomb in Mrs. Thatcher's hotel
during a political convention in Brighton, south England, in
October 1984. She escaped injury, but five other people were killed.
   In May, after a 14-month lull, the IRA resumed attacks on
British military targets in continental Europe.
   Three British servicemen have been killed and 12 people wounded
in four machine gun and bombing attacks in the three months in West
Germany and Holland.
   Jackie Donnelly of the Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political
wing, said last week attacks on British soldiers had ``more value''
_ more impact in Britain _ than killing policemen or locally
recruited soldiers in Northern Ireland.
   ``So from that perspective, the IRA certainly would like to
target more British soldiers,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Twelve British soldiers have been killed in Northern Ireland
this year. Britain has had soldiers in the province since sectarian
violence began in August 1969.
   Civilian workers said security was lax at Inglis.
   Mary Onisiforo, 23, who took over a shop in the barracks four
months ago, said she did not even have a security pass for three
months. ``Everybody knows there is no security there,'' she said.
   In its most serious attack on the military in Britain, the IRA
killed 11 soldiers and seven of their horses in double bombings of
a military band and cavalrymen in two London parks in July 1982.

   Michael Dukakis said Monday the Reagan
administration, with ``cramped ideals and limited ambitions,'' has
spent huge amounts of money on wasteful projects rather than
helping blacks and poor people. President Reagan suggested that if
Dukakis is elected, ``all of us may be picking up the pieces.''
   Dukakis, in a speech, did not mention by name his expected
presidential election rival, Republican George Bush. But he made it
clear he was including the vice president in his criticism of the
administration.
   ``We're going to have a president and a vice president who
understand that affirmative action is an essential part of making
the American dream come true for each and every citizen of our
country,'' Dukakis told the National Urban League.
   Reagan, meanwhile, in remarks prepared for delivery at a
fund-raiser for Sen. Bill Roth, R-Del., took issue with Dukakis _
also without naming him _ for declaring in his nomination
acceptance speech that ``the Reagan era'' is ending.
   ``Does he want to end the era of lower tax rates and higher real
income for families, record numbers of jobs, low inflation and
interest rates, steady growth and respect, not just lip-service for
families?'' Reagan asked.
   ``America this year has come to a divide in the road,'' Reagan
said. ``Take one fork and we continue in the direction that Bill
Roth has helped chart. Take the other, and in four years all of us
may be picking up the pieces.''
   Bush was out of the public eye at the White House Monday, still
weighing his choice of a running mate. And Dukakis, whose reception
was cordial but unenthusiastic received his only standing ovation
when commenting on the vice president's absence from the meeting of
the non-partisan group.
   Aides said Bush couldn't appear because of a prior commitment.
   Bush is to travel to Chicago on Tuesday for a foreign policy
speech, then make a trip to Texas later in the week before flying
to his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for the weekend. He is to
address the Republican platform committee next Monday in New
Orleans, one week before the party opens its national convention in
that city.
   While Democratic senators worked in Washington to draft a
compromise package of new aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, Dukakis
reiterated his opposition to U.S. assistance to the Contras.
   ``It's a failed and illegal policy and it ought to stop,''
Dukakis said prior to leaving Boston.
   ``Right now the administration once again seems to be doing
everything again to ... destroy the peace process,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democratic nominee said that, in principle, he does not
favor humanitarian aid but would accept it if the aid was part of a
negotiated settlement and the money was used to resettle the
Contras and end the war.
   Democrats, in working on a new aid package, are trying to defuse
an issue that has divided Dukakis, who opposes Contra aid, from his
running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, who has consistently supported it.
   Dukakis insisted he wasn't bothered by Bentsen's support of
Contra aid.
   Bentsen spent most of Monday in private meetings in Washington
in preparation for expected action this week on trade and
plant-closing notification legislation.
   Dukakis, stepping up his efforts among the nation's black voters
who earlier backed Jesse Jackson's presidential bid, said in his
speech, ``We have to transform the cycle of poverty into a ladder
of opportunity, and that ladder must be sturdy and strong for all
our citizens.''
   ``Some people say it can't be done,'' he said. ``I say we
haven't tried.''
   Then, using a rhetorical tool often employed by Jackson, Dukakis
accused the Reagan administration of spending vast sums of money on
bad policies, following each contention with the refrain that at
the same time ``we haven't tried'' to help minorities and others.
   ``Fifteen billion dollars already wasted on Star Wars. We
haven't tried,'' Dukakis said. ``Thirty-six billion dollars for two
super-carrier task forces we don't need and can't afford. My
friends, we haven't tried.
   ``Hundreds of thousands of wasted lives, and millions of dollars
to overthrow the government of Nicaragua. My friends, we haven't
tried.
   ``An annual assault on the opportunity to go to college that has
left us with fewer black college students today than we had seven
years ago. We haven't tried.''
   In Chicago, meanwhile, Jackson, who lost the Democratic
nomination to Dukakis, said Monday he is willing to meet with New
York Mayor Edward Koch to try and iron out differences dating back
to Koch's strong crticism of Jackson before New York's April
primary.
   Koch, in New York, said, ``If you really believe as I do that
it's important to have a Democrat in the White House, you set aside
those differences.''
   Another former candidate, Republican Pat Robertson, returned
Monday as co-host of his cable network's flagship program, ``The
700 Club''.
   Dukakis received good news on the homefront before traveling to
Detroit.
   According to law enforcement sources who spoke only on condition
they not be named, the FBI has informed the state that a
preliminary inquiry turned up no evidence of law-breaking to
support charges that the Dukakis administration leaked confidential
information on prison-siting plans to developers who then bought
land and offered to sell it to the state.
   The allegations, lodged by opponents of plans to build a 500-bed
state prison in rural New Braintree, Mass., had been cited by
Dukakis critics to attack the good-government pledges at the center
of his presidential campaign.
   FBI Boston spokesman John Cloherty refused to characterize the
outcome of the inquiry but said no charges had been filed.
   In Washington, the Federal Election Commission told a federal
appeals court that the Democratic ticket should get $46 million in
matching funds despite a Republican contention that Bentsen was
benefiting unfairly. Bentsen is also running for re-election to his
Senate seat and has raised money for that race.

   Taylor, 56, who was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Santa
Monica, Calif. on Thursday, will require strict bed rest and
physiotherapy, her physician, William Skinner, said in a brief news

<TEXT>
   Banks and exchange houses closed
Monday in the first of two government-ordered bank holidays, but
Argentines were kept in suspense about economic measures being
prepared.
   The president of the Union of Argentine Commercial Businesses,
Alberto Arrojo, said the pending changes seem like ``another
attempt to transfer resources from the private sector to the public
sector.''
   The General Federation of Labor, which claims 3 million members,
called off a meeting with Rodolfo Terragno, minister of public
works and services, pending a briefing on the plan.
   In Congress, an opposition Peronist Party deputy, Jorge Matzkin,
complained his party was not consulted on the reforms, and he
demanded a ``detailed report'' on negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund regarding Argentina's $55 billion
foreign debt.
   On Sunday, the Central Bank announced banks and exchange houses
would be closed Monday and Tuesday while the government put the
finishing touches on a new, anti-inflationary economic package. No
details were disclosed.
   On Monday, President Raul Alfonsin met with Economy Minister
Juan Sourrouille, Central Bank President Jose Machinea and Treasury
Secretary Mario Brodersohn. Machinea and Brodersohn returned Sunday
from Washington, where they reportedly negotiated a $1.2 billion
stand-by loan from the IMF.
   Reportedly under consideration are wage and price controls,
major hikes in bus fares and other public services, taxes on
exports, devaluation of the austral, Argentina's currency, and
other measures aimed at curtailing triple-digit inflation.
   The inflation rate stood at 121.2 percent over the past six
months, and 321.7 percent over the past 12 months. The cost of
living rose 18 percent in June; the July rise has been anticipated
at more than 20 percent.
   The economic overhaul will be Alfonsin's second since the
civilian president replaced a military government in December 1983.
In June 1985, with annual inflation at more than 1,000 percent, he
imposed a wage and price freeze, placed a cap on government
employment and replaced the peso with the austral.
   In 1986, the inflation rate in the nation of 31 million dropped
to its lowest rate in the 1980s when it hit 82 percent.
   Last year, however, the rate was 175 percent.

<HEAD>North Yemen President Swears In New Cabinet After Elections</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SAN`A, North Yemen (AP) _ President Ali Abdullah Saleh swore in
a new Cabinet Monday and called on officials to ensure a prominent
role for the Red Sea state in international forums.
   He also urged closer cooperation with Marxist South Yemen, three
months after the two Arab neighbors eased travel restrictions and
settled a border dispute.
   Saleh, chairman for the first session of the 24-member Cabinet,
said a heightened international profile would ``crystallize the
country's role in serving just causes of humanity and issues of
world peace and stability, based on the principles of positive
neutrality and non-alignment.''
   Saleh made minor changes in the Cabinet following July 5
parliamentary elections.
   According to the constitution, Saleh also had to resign after
the elections but was quickly nominated by the 159-member
parliament, the Majlis Al-Shura, to a third five-year term.
   Abdel-Aziz Abdel-Ghani remained as prime minister along with his
four deputies. The minister of development, Mohammed Saeed
Al-Attar, retained his position and also was named as a fifth
deputy premier.
   Seven ministers retained their portfolios, seven others changed
Cabinet positions and five new ministers were named.
   Among the changes, a San`a military hospital doctor, Mohammad
Ali, became minister of health, and the ambassador to Morocco,
Mohammed Abdel-Hamid, was named minister of economy, supply and
trade.
   In May, North and smaller South Yemen agreed to ease travel
restrictions between their countries and settled a bitter dispute
over an oil field that straddles their border.
   Diplomatic sources quoted at the time said South Yemeni
representatives indicated they were willing to consider merging
with North Yemen in five years.

   An Armenian dissident expelled from the Soviet
Union flew from Rome to Paris on Monday, saying he would try to
return to his homeland and to take an active role in its battle for
greater autonomy.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan, 39, was banished from the Soviet Union July 21
on charges of slandering the country. He first went to Ethiopia,
then traveled to Rome Saturday to arrange asylum in the United
States.
   Ayrikyan said he planned to spend several days in Paris visiting
his cousin, Sylva Ayrikyan, and recovering from a sore throat.
   ``My objective is to return to Armenia,'' he told reporters at
Rome's Fiumicino Airport before leaving for Paris. ``My place is
there.''
   In Paris, Ayrikyan was welcomed in a brief ceremony at Charles
de Gaulle Airport by a delegation from the Armenian community and
by Bernard Kouchner, the minister for humanitarian action in
Socialist Premier Michel Rocard's government.
   Ayrikyan was released last year after 17 years of imprisonment.
   He was jaillic of Armenia. It
is now part of the neighboring Azerbaijan republic.
   Asked about the policies of greater openness and individual
freedom championed by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Ayrikyan
said, ``While there is only one party ... you can't talk about a
real democratic process.''
   Ayrikyan said he planned later to travel to Bonn, West Germany,
to be reunited with his wife and three children, who are still in
the Soviet Union.
   The dissident said he then would go to the United States. He has
said he will settle in the Los Angeles area.

   Soldiers killed 14 Shining Path guerrillas
in a clash near this highland city, and a military sentry in Lima
was fatally wounded Monday during a foiled rebel attack, officials
said.
   The military command in Ayacucho, 225 miles southeast of Lima,
said a fierce firefight between troops and a Maoist guerrilla
column last Thursday on the city's isolated northeastern outskirts
left 14 rebels dead.
   The military reported the fighting here Sunday, but news reports
could not reach the capital, Lima, until Monday because of a
Shining Path attack last week on power pylons, which cut power
supplies and most telephone and microwave transmissions.
   Lima police said a military sentry at the Factory of Munitions
of the Army was fatally wounded at dawn Monday by suspected Shining
Path guerrillas, who attempted to plant a bomb at a gate.
   The assailants fled after shots were fired. Police said the
soldier died hours later in a hospital near the factory, located in
a northwestern suburb.
   Six women and four men were arrested in sweeps of the area
following the attack, police said.
   The government says the eight-year insurgency by the Shining
Path has claimed 15,000 lives and caused damage of $10 billion.
   The guerrillas seek to topple Peru's elected government and
impose Marxist rule, based on the worker-peasant state created by
China's Mao-Tse Tung.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday he will announce D-Day, a date for a cease-fire in the
8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, after his fact-finding team returns from
those countries this week and he consults the Security Council.
   ``The D-Day doesn't depend on the parties,'' the U.N. chief
said, indicating he could make a unilateral decision and go ahead
without the agreement of Iraq. Iran says it is ready to honor an
immediate cease-fire.
   Perez de Cuellar made the statement to reporters after a
three-hour meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati.
   Announcement of a truce date would put pressure on Iraq to
compromise and drop its insistence on direct talks with Iran before
a cease-fire.
   No immediate reaction surfaced from Iraq.
   Perez de Cuellar said a U.N. military team of experts now is in
Amman, Jordan, preparing its report, and the team leader will
present it to him in New York Wednesday.
   ``I will study his report. I will be in touch with members of
the (Security) Council and then I will decide on a D-Day,'' Perez
de Cuellar said.
   ``It is very difficult to tell you now,'' he said when asked if
he would announce D-Day this week. He cautioned against the idea
that a cease-fire could be simply or rapidly implemented.
   The secretary-general said once D-Day is decided, he will begin
consulting nations which could provide about 250 military observers
to monitor the cease-fire and troop withdrawal.
   The U.N. chief held his sixth meeting with Velayati since talks
began last week. He has met three times with Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz, but Iraq said it was not prepared to enter into
substantive talks with Perez de Cuellar until direct talks take
place.
   Iraqi officials also have not responded to a U.N. report on
chemical weapons which concluded that the Baghdad government has
made frequent and large-scale use of the outlawed weapons against
Iranian forces.
   Velayati and Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati of Iran told
reporters Monday that Iran wants the secretary-general to go ahead
and name the cease-fire date, with or without Iraq's agreement.
   ``Iran is immediately ready to implement (a U.N. peace)
resolution by a cease-fire,'' Mahallati said.
   Perez de Cuellar said it was ``theoretically correct'' he could
unilaterally announce a cease-fire date, ``but I prefer to wait for
my team, be in touch with members of the council and perhaps the
parties.''
   He said he hoped for ``the shortest possible period'' between
the announcement of a D-Day and the beginning of a cease-fire.
   The war, which began in September 1980, has cost an estimated 1
million lives.
   In response to questions, the U.N. chief said that if he or the
council declared a cease-fire ``and one side does not respect it .
.. that is for the council to decide.''
   Velayati told reporters all major issues have been covered in
their meetings ``and there is no substantial point (of
disagreement) between us and the secretary-general.''
   Velayati also said, ``We think that especially after recent use
of chemical weapons ... now the Security Council should do
something against Iraq.''
   The experts' detailed report mentioned nine Iraqi soldiers
poisoned in a battle zone, allegedly in a mustard gas attack by
Iran.
   Other U.N. reports have said Iraq used chemical weapons, which
are outlawed under the 1925 Geneva Convention, and the Security
Council recently condemned use of the illegal weapons in the war.
   Sadoun Hamadi, Iraqi minister of state for foreign affairs,
earlier Monday repeated his country's insistence on direct talks
before a truce during an appearance on state television in Baghdad.
   The 15-member Security Council gave unanimous approval July 20,
1987, to Resolution 598, which provides for a cease-fire,
withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace
negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started
the war in September 1980.
   Iraq agreed to accept the resolution soon after it was passed
last summer, but Iran had refused until two weeks ago, July 18.
   The chemical weapons report was prepared by two specialist
physicians who visited both countries in early July.
   ``We deeply regret to say that on the basis of evidence gathered
and in spite of repeated appeals by the United Nations, chemical
weapons continue to be used on an intensive scale against Iranian
forces,'' it said.
   ``From the examination of weapon fragements it can be concluded
that bombs similar to those used in 1984, 1986 and 1987 have again
been used against Iranian forces on Iranian territory, indicating
their repeated utilization by Iraqi forces.''
   Iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons, but claims Iran
introduced them to the war.

   Floods in eastern China's Zhejiang province
claimed at least 214 lives and 449 people are missing, the official
China Daily newspaper reported Monday.
   It said torrential rains caused flooding Friday and Saturday
that left thousands of people homeless.
   The newspaper quoted a provincial official as saying 16,949
houses, 305 bridges and 100 reservoirs were destroyed. It said he
placed economic losses at $167 million.
   The deaths brought to at least 750 the number of Chinese
reported to have perished in floods this year. Hundreds of others
have died from heat-related causes in one of the hottest summers in
years in central and southern China where there are water and food
shortages from a prolonged drought.

<TEXT>
   Troops killed 18 communist and Moslem
secessionist rebels in clashes, military reports said Monday. The
military also said vandals damaged the tomb of President Corazon
Aquino's husband.
   Maj. Hernando Patawaran, spokesman of the Presidential Security
Group, said vandals pried a concrete slab loose on the tomb of
assassinated former Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., but the body was not
disturbed. Workers installed steel sheets to protect the body.
   In Bangkok, Thailand, Adm. Ronald J. Hays, commander-in-chief of
the U.S. Pacific Command, said Monday that if American bases in the
Philippines are lost, there will be ``only one big winner _ the
Soviet Union.''
   But Hays told reporters he was ``bullish about the future of the
bases.''
   The Philippines broke off talks on the bases with the United
States July 26. Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said differences
over U.S. compensation for use of the bases were so wide he doubted
the talks could be revived. The agreement on Clark Air Base and
Subic Bay Naval Base expires in 1991.
   The official Philippine News Agency said troops killed nine
communist New People's Army guerrillas and wounded three in a
three-hour battle Sunday in Nueva Vizcaya province, 130 miles north
of Manila.
   It said government forces suffered no casualties.
   The clash occurred one day after marines and militiamen repulsed
two separate attacks by Moslem secessionists on Basilan and Jolo
islands, killing nine insurgents.
   A military report said about 80 members of the Moro National
Liberation Front tried to storm a marine camp on Basilan, 550 miles
south of Manila, but were driven away.
   Seven rebels were killed, the report said. It did not mention
government casualties. Two other Moslem seccessionists were killed
and four militiamen were wounded in a clash on on Jolo Island,
southwest of Basilan, another report said.
   The Moro front has been fighting for Moslem rule on Mindanao and
other southern islands since 1972.
   Patawaran said the vandalism of the Aquino tomb apparently
occurred Friday and was discovered Saturday after workers at the
Manila Memorial Park cemetery reported receiving a telephone call
that a bomb had been planted in the tomb.
   Patawaran said officials had no idea who desecrated the tomb or
why.
   Aquino was shot on Aug. 21, 1983, upon returning from three
years of self-imposed exile in the United States. His death fueled
opposition to President Ferdinand Marcos, culminating in a
civilian-military revolt that unseated Marcos in February 1986 and
drove him into exile after 20 years in office. The revolt swept
Mrs. Aquino into the presidency.
   Patawaran said workers cemented the slab back after bomb experts
found no explosives inside.
   Soldiers guarded the tomb Monday.

<TEXT>
   Teen-agers from an Ozarks town responded
with a resounding cheer Monday, and maybe even kicked up their
heels a bit, when a federal judge threw out a century-old ban on
school dances.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark said the ban on
school-sponsored dancing in Purdy has the effect of promoting
religious values, is unconstitutional, and ``must be invalidated.''
   ``I thought we'd win,'' said Nancy Fox, 16, who will be student
president at the 160-pupil Purdy High School this fall. ``They
(school board members) never gave anything concrete, a good reason
why we shouldn't dance.''
   The judge stopped short of ordering the school board to schedule
a dance. Miss Fox said she would try to organize a school-year
opening dance.
   Residents of Purdy, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, say
the ban could be 100 years old. The rule states: `School dances are
not authorized and school premises shall not be used for purposes
of conducting a dance.''
   The judge, in his ruling, said, ``Even if the defendants could
show a valid secular purpose, the primary effect of this rule is to
endorse the tenets of that particular religious group in Purdy who
believe that social dancing is sinful.''
   Clark awarded the plaintiffs in the 1986 civil suit nearly
everything the 21 students and their parents asked for: $1 in
nominal damages, attorney fees and an order that the school board
stop enforcing its ban on dancing.
   About 20 teens and a few parents drove to the courthouse in
Springfield to hear the judge's decision from their attorney,
William Fleischaker.
   ``I hope at this point they (school board members) will sit down
with the students and they will come up with a plan to have a
dance,'' Fleischaker said. ``I think if they don't start being
reasonable, they're likely to be dealt with harshly in the future.
We could theoretically end up back in court asking enforcement of
the decision.''
   School board member Art Negre said he had not been advised of
Clark's ruling and had no comment. Repeated attempts to reach the
other school board members by phone were unsuccessful and
Superintendent Sheldon Buxton was reported to be out of the state.
   Ransom Ellis Jr., an attorney for the school board, said the
court's conclusions that the board was motivated by religious
reasons ``in our viewpoint was not correct,'' but no decision on an
appeal had been made.
   ``We're deeply disappointed in the court's decision,'' Ellis
said. ``In our view we do not believe the board acted in an
unconstitutional manner. They were reacting to the community
viewpoint, which they as elected officials were obligated to do.''
   Clark called ``unpersuasive'' the testimony of school board
members during a four-day hearing in June that they did not know
why the community opposed dancing, but felt the ban was the will of
the majority.
   ``This court is skeptical that it heard the complete story
concerning the board members' deliberations of the rule and the
religious significance of the opposition to dancing in Purdy,''
Clark wrote.
   Although dances were banned on school property, dances have been
held at a community center in the town, and Purdy students have
organized junior-senior proms and held them in neighboring
communities.
   The controversy escalated after the class of 1986 failed to
persuade the school board to drop the ban, and dance supporters
held a rally like the one in the movie, ``Footloose,'' about a
fictional Texas town where dancing was banned.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Venice Film Festival will show Martin Scorsese's
``The Last Temptation of Christ'' in spite of criticism by Italy's
largest political party and religious groups.
   The film has provoked pickets and protests in the United States.
   Genny Fiorin, the head of Italy's Cinema Office, said Monday
that Scorsese's film will be shown at the international festival
that takes place Aug. 28-Sept. 9.
   ``Of course we will show the film,'' Fiorin said in a telephone
interview from Venice. ``Why not show it?''
   Festival director Guglielmo Biraghi approved the showing of the
movie. He told journalists Friday that entries should be judged
only by the moviegoing public.
   The Christian Democrats, the dominant party in Italy's
five-party coalition government, condemned the film that portrays
Jesus Christ as fantasizing about making love to Mary Magdalene.
   On Monday, the head of the Italian Roman Catholic organization
Reagire (React) sent Biraghi a telegram calling the film
blasphemous.
   The president of the Italian National Association of Film
Critics, Lino Micciche, expressed his organization's support for
Biraghi's decision in a statement released Monday.
   The association and festival officials chose nine films for
presentation during the ``Week of Criticism.''
   Biraghi told a news conference Friday he would leave the
festival if he could not work in peace.

<HEAD>Two Studios Offer To Pay Union Fines For Returning Writers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two film studios said Monday they will pay
any union fines incurred by striking scriptwriters who return to
work while the union's 22-week strike continues.
   But a dissident group of writers, which has threatened
strike-breaking in the past, announced at the same time that it
would continue to honor the Writers Guild of America walkout.
   On Sunday, the contract talks were declared ``hopelessly
deadlocked'' by Nicholas Counter III, president of the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers. He added that it was
expected some union members would ignore guild warnings and return
to work.
   Jeffrey Katzenberg and Barry Diller, the respective heads of
Walt Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox, said that their studios
will compensate union members who return to work in violation of
union orders.
   Michael Binkow, a spokesman for Fox, confirmed Diller's offer.
Katzenberg's proposal was reported in Tuesday's editions of The New
York Times.
   Union fines against strike-breaking writers are set at 110
percent of all payment received for unauthorized strike work, said
union spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden. Furthermore, violators are subject
to lifetime expulsion from the guild, Rhoden said.
   Rhoden said that she knew of no movement within union ranks to
accept the indemnification proposal.
   ``It remains to be seen if any writers will be interested in
such protection or pseudo-protection,'' Rhoden said.
   Among those who have been expected to resign from the guild are
members of the Writers Coalition, 21 writers who have pushed for a
strike settlement under contract terms that union members have
strongly opposed.
   The coalition, after a four-hour strategy conference Monday,
announced that it would remain with the guild. The group was
apparently encouraged by a discussion with Brian Walton, executive
director of the WGA West and the guild's chief negotiator.
   The coalition had threatened to leave the guild on July 28 but
changed its plans last week when negotiations appeared to be making
progress.
   The strike by more than 9,000 union members began March 7.
   Meanwhile, Walton said on a recorded union hot line message
Monday that he hoped all members ``will decline (the) invitation''
to write during the strike.
   Walton said, too, that the WGA has asked the U.S. Labor
Department not to grant work visas to foreign writers coming to the
United States to write for Hollywood production companies during
the strike.
   ``Indemnification is a matter for discussion between each studio
and a specific writers,'' Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the
producers alliance, said Monday. ``(Indemnification) is not an
alliance function.''
   Rhoden said that any indemnification payments would be seen by
the union as compensation and therefore subject to further fines.
   ``The production companies are not concerned about the
writers,'' Rhoden said. ``They are looking for their own short-term
gain. One writing assignment is not worth a whole career. And
people do not forget when people cross a picket line in the middle
of a strike.''
   The union has so far handed out more than $2 million in hardship
loans to its finacially strapped members, Rhoden said.
   Meanwhile, the union was optimistic that contract talks with the
producers might resume, and placed the blame for last weekend's
negoatiating collapse on the alliance.
   ``We are doing all that we can to continue the negotiating
process,'' Walton said on the union's hot line message. ``It's
regrettable that the alliance has no such commitment to the
industry.''
   The producers have insisted that the union is making
unreasonable demands and repeatedly refuses to make any contract
compromises.

   Gusty wind fanned fires in Yellowstone National Park to greater
size Monday, and hundreds of firefighters were sent to the fire
lines in Idaho in a drive to contain a week-old fire in rugged
terrain.
   Fires also burned in Utah, Washington, Oregon and Montana.
   More than 125,500 acres had been burned in Yellowstone, the
oldest national park.
   High wind Sunday, and again on Monday, combined with backburning
intended to stop the blazes, spread the North Fork fire about four
miles west of the Old Faithful geyser complex from 11,300 acres to
12,700 in 24 hours, said fire information officer Earl LaOrange.
   About 360 firefighters were sent out Monday to re-establish fire
lines along the southern and eastern edges of the fire where the
wind pushed flames over fire breaks, said Larry Blade, another fire
information officer.
   Also jumping substantially in size was the Fan fire in the
park's northwestern corner, from 7,500 acres to roughly 11,600,
said LaOrange. The Lewis Lake or Red fire near Grant Village
covered 12,700 acres Monday and the nearby Shoshone fire had
blackened 13,100 acres, he said.
   The Wyoming Travel Commission opened a hot line Monday to answer
tourists' questions about the fire at Yellowstone.
   ``The forest fires have certainly gained us national attention,
but we are concerned that tourists planning to visit Yellowstone
and the Cowboy State may change their plans,'' said commission
director Gene Bryan.
   East of Yellowstone in the Bighorn National Forest, about 500
firefighters returned to work Monday in a drive to control two
fires covering an estimated 2,550 acres.
   Fire bosses in Idaho used more than 1,150 firefighters to
contain the 5,000-acre Willis Gulch fire in central Idaho, which
officials have determined was started by a cigarette.
   Most of the work in the rocky terrain had to be done by hand,
said Boise National Forest Service spokeswoman Jean Hawthorne said.
``The country is so steep and rugged, bulldozers can only do so
much,'' she said.
   The seven-day-old blaze about 35 miles northeast of Boise had
destroyed $7.5 million worth of timber and other resources and cost
over $1 million to fight.
   Elsewhere in Idaho, some 200 firefighters reached 90 percent
containment of the 110-acre Riordan Lake fire, burning in heavy
timber in a remote roadless area near Cascade. Fire bosses expected
full containment by Tuesday evening.
   In southwestern Montana, firefighters closed roads into the Lake
Como area Monday and shut down its recreational facilities as they
drove to complete lines around the Rock Creek fire, which had
burned 3,200 acres of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and the
Bitterroot National Forest since July 22.
   Forest information officer Jo Barnier said 682 firefighters had
completed lines around 90 percent of the fire.
   A Texas man accused of starting that fire appeared in court
Monday on a misdemeanor charge of allowing a camp fire to escape,
Barnier said.
   Low temperatures and high humidity helped efforts to contain
three fires burning in Washington state, said Department of Natural
Resources and U.S. Forest Service officials.
   The largest, the 3,600-acre Falls Creek fire, was 90 percent
contained, said Forest Service spokeswoman Kathy Albert. A 55-acre
fire on the Olympic Peninsula near Hoquiam was under control and
firefighters had almost suppressed a 75-acre blaze near Skykomish,
officials said.
   High wind Monday morning in Oregon hampered efforts to contain
an 145-acre fire in the Mount Hood National Forest, but spokeswoman
Jane Cottrell said a line had been built around 95 percent of the
fire. She said firefighters expect to have it contained by Tuesday.
   A three-mile section of a Forest Service road was closed as
officials expressed concern for the safety of mountain bikers who
had been seen in the vicinity, Cottrell said.
   In southern Oregon, firefighters contained nearly 90 small
blazes Sunday on private and public lands.
   In northern Utah, a crew battled a 400-acre fire, said
Interagency Fire Center dispatcher Bill Brooks.

Case</HEAD>

   A pretrial hearing Monday for the
Washington Public Power Supply System bond default trial dealt with
such matters as witness testimony by satellite, jury size and
selection and juror notebooks.
   But U.S. District Judge William D. Browning also said he will
take up on Friday a defense motion asking him to order the
plaintiffs to drop assertions of conspiracy or to delay the Sept. 7
trial at least 60 days.
   The 1983 WPPSS default is the largest in municipal bond history,
on $2.25 billion in bonds it sold to finance construction of two
nuclear power plants in Washington state.
   Plaintiffs include more than 24,000 bondholders who have filed
proofs of claim and Chemical Bank of New York, the trustee
representing bondholders.
   The bondholders, suing as a class action, are alleging fraud,
negligence and conspiracy, said attorney Paul Bernstein, chairman
of a lawyers' group representing the purchasers. They are seeking
more than $1 billion in damages.
   Chemical Bank is seeking $7 billion for the value of the bonds
plus interest.
   The case, which is expected to last at least a year, shapes up
as being of epic proportions, reputedly one of the biggest
securities cases ever.
   Ten groups representing 50 defendants remain from 104 initially
named that included the Power Supply System, various officers and
88 utilities that participated in construction of the abandoned
power plants.
   The federal Bonneville Power Administration and others,
including bond and special counsel to WPPSS, engineers, bond
underwriters, financial consultants and architects, also were named
initially. But Browning has ruled that Bonneville cannot be sued,
and last year underwriters reached a tentative agreement that would
let them out for $92 million.
   Junius Hoffman, acting as Browning's settlement master, said
Monday that settlements amounting to $100,570,000 have been
approved by the judge to date, with others worth another $170
million pending.
   The pretrial conference was to resume Tuesday.
   Browning issued an order July 14 allowing the plaintiffs to
pursue certain conspiracy allegations. But defense lawyers, in a
postponement motion filed Friday by attorney Peter J. Nickles, said
the judge noted in his order that the plaintiffs ``had not
indicated their intention to pursue their conspiracy allegations''
before March _ five years after the litigation began.
   The trial was moved from Seattle to Tucson because of concern
over the ability to select an impartial jury in the Northwest,
where the case has received extensive publicity and where utility
customers' rates stand to be affected by the outcome of the case.

   Waiters, cashiers and others with little control
over demanding jobs face an added heart attack risk about as big as
that from smoking or high cholesterol, a study of nearly 5,000 men
suggests.
   The study found that male workers in the top 10 percent for such
``job strain'' had 3.8 to 4.8 times the heart attack risk of men in
the bottom 10 percent.
   A second analysis found that men in the top 20 percent for job
strain, a list that included cooks, gas station attendants and
firemen, had 2.5 to 3.3 times the risk of the rest of the workers
studied.
   Each analysis gave two numbers because it was performed on two
groups of men. The ``true'' answer probably lies about halfway in
between, said Robert Karasek, associate professor in the industrial
and systems engineering department at the University of Southern
California.
   Employers may be able to redesign high-strain jobs to lower
heart attack risk and improve productivity, said Karasek.

   Seventeen advocates for the homeless are arrested
after seizing a vacant Seattle hotel. Activists take over two
abandoned public housing units in Chicago. During a day of
nationwide protests, 18 people are arrested in Boston as they try
to commandeer a boarded-up building.
   New, more aggressive tactics to get housing for America's
homeless have led to repeated assaults on vacant buildings for
takeover and restoration.
   ``Abandoned buildings are a very powerful symbol,'' said
activist Mitch Snyder. ``There's no reason for them to lie fallow
while millions of people are homeless, except for lack of funding.''
   Snyder and his Washington-based Community for Creative
Non-Violence have organized sit-ins and monthlong hunger strikes in
their push for shelters and housing for the homeless.
   ``Creating shelters is no alternative to affordable housing,''
Snyder said. ``I went to 48 cities in two weeks last month meeting
with people and encouraging them to plan occupations of buildings.''

   Gazing up at the sheer limestone
north face of the Eiger, mountaineer Heinrich Harrer reminisced
about the climb 50 years ago that changed his life.
   In July 1938, he and three other climbers became the first to
scale the daunting 5,940-foot wall in the heart of the Swiss Alps
that is considered Europe's greatest challenge to mountaineers.
   ``We were never afraid. We never had any idea of returning or
giving up'' despite difficulties during the four-day adventure, the
76-year-old Harrer told The Associated Press in a recent interview.
   Nine people had already died on the wall before Harrer and Fritz
Kasparek, both Austrians, and Andreas Heckmair and Ludwig Voerg,
both Germans, set out before dawn one morning to conquer the last
virgin face of the Alps.
   Because of the danger, authorities had outlawed attempts to
climb the north face. But the four defied the ban.

   The decision by King Hussein of Jordan to cut
ties with the Israeli-occupied West Bank has alarmed Palestinians
and damaged the election hopes of Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres.
   The Jordanian monarch made it clear he was giving up his claim
to the West Bank, which his grandfather King Abdullah annexed in
1950 and which he lost to Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In deference to Arab and Palestinian demands, he said, Jordan
would dissolve ``legal and administrative links'' to Palestinians
in the occupied territories.
   That remark prompted widespread concern among Palestinians, much
of it voiced privately, about how far Hussein will go in breaking
his ties with Palestinians in the occupied territories.

   Trying to preserve a faltering Mideast peace
initiative, the United States called Monday for both Jordan and
Palestinians to participate in any Arab-Israeli negotiations
despite a decision by King Hussein to abandon ``legal and
administrative links'' to the West Bank.
   While Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy heads for
the Mideast to seek an explanation from the Jordanian monarch and
to assess prospects for peace talks, the State Department asserted
there would be no immediate change in the U.S. formula for
resolving the 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute.
   The plan calls for negotiations between Israel and a mixed
delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians, with no direct role for

   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told 200 top
Soviet officers Monday he has seen no evidence for the Kremlin's
claim that it has adopted a defensive military strategy.
   At the start of a four-day visit expected to offer a glimpse of
secret Soviet equipment and bases, Carlucci spent two hours with
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and addressed senior officers at
the General Staff's Voroshilov Academy.
   About 1,800 miles away in Central Asia, four missiles were blown
apart to begin the Soviet program of destroying more than 1,700
weapons under the superpower treaty banning intermediate-range
nuclear rockets, the official news agency Tass reported.
   Carlucci called the destruction of the missiles a ``great
event.'' Tass said the short-range missiles, known in the west as
SS-12s, were destroyed in the presence of U.S. inspectors at the
Saryozek test range in Kazakhstan.
   At the end of the day, Carlucci told reporters his talks with
Yazov ``went very well.'' He praised the academy staff for showing
him the classrooms and laboratories where Soviet military strategy
is developed.

   NASA detected a new liquid hydrogen
leak Monday as it put space shuttle Discovery through a fullscale
countdown rehearsal, and officials said the problem could further
delay a crucial engine test firing beyond Thursday.
   Had the leak been found during an actual count, the launch would
have been scrubbed. But because it was a test, the launch director
bypassed the problem to gather as much data and experience as
possible from the first such rehearsal since the Challenger
disaster 2{ years ago.
   ``The launch team did a superb job on the wet countdown
demonstration test and accomplished most of the objectives,'' said
Robert Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations.
   Objectives missed during the ``wet'' test, in which the liquid
propellants were pumped to the shuttle's tanks, will be sought
during a second countdown leading to the 20-second firing of
Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said a firm schedule for the
test-firing would not be set until at least Tuesday, after
technicians have had a chance to trace the source of the latest
leak, in a launch pad service mast.

   President Reagan endorsed a compromise bill
Monday that would give the federal government its first significant
power to combat housing discrimination against minorities, women,
the handicapped and families with children.
   Reagan urged Congress to ``pass the bill swiftly'' so he could
sign ``the landmark civil rights bill for which we have worked so
long and hard.''
   The Senate debated amendments to the legislation Monday, but
decided a final vote would not be taken until Tuesday.
   Major civil rights organizations have given the bill a high
priority because the original Fair Housing Act of 1968 contained
weak enforcement provisions.
   The compromise bill includes not only strong enforcement
provisions but would expand protection to the handicapped and
families with children for the first time.

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Monday it wants the government to capture expected windfall
corporate profits that could reach $7 billion during future cuts in
production of chemicals that destroy the Earth's protective ozone
layer.
   But the agency said it had not decided how to do that, and one
major producer said it doubts that there will be major windfalls as
the chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbon or CFC compounds _ are cut back.
   EPA disclosed that it was considering regulations that could
require manufacturers to pay fees to the government equal to their
extra profits; could require recycling or other controls on
manufacturing processes; or could require companies to buy
manufacturing rights from the government at auctions open to anyone.
   The agency announced final adoption of detailed regulations,
including production quotas, to carry out last year's treaty
obliging major nations to cut CFC production 50 percent by 1998.
   EPA expects enough countries to ratify the treaty for it to take
effect next Jan. 1. Eleven nations accounting for two-thirds of
world production must ratify; six including the United States have
done so.

   Amish farmer Elam Swartzentruber
believes he has something better than electricity and technology to
help him through the worst drought in more than 50 years: faith and
brotherhood.
   Swartzentruber, better known by his Amish neighbors as ``Elam
E.,'' is one of approximately 30,000 Amish residents in Ohio,
15,000 of them involved in farming.
   The Amish, a Protestant group formed in a split with the
Mennonites in 17th century Switzerland, believe in simplicity. They
dress plainly, are forbidden to have electricity in their homes and
do not use motorized equipment on their farms.
   It is that difference from the way ``the English'' work the land
that has protected the Amish and Mennonites from financial ruin
during the drought that is plaguing the Midwest. The Mennonites
also follow simple ways, but are permitted to use some modern
technology.

<HEAD>Proposed Highway Site Sits Empty as Controversy Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Copenhill, a vine-covered slope with a nice view
of Atlanta, is popular with people who cut swaths through Georgia.
   In 1864, Gen. William T. Sherman camped there during the battle
for Atlanta before he burned the city and began his ruinous march
to the sea.
   In the late 1960s, there was a plan to build a road through the
area, and the state condemned and destroyed hundreds of homes to
make way for it before the project was dropped.
   The Carter Presidential Center occupies it now and wants to
build a road linking the complex to downtown Atlanta. But the
right-of-way sits empty and overgrown as neighborhood groups
continue a battle over whether the road should be built.
   At one point, when construction started, workers shook
protesters from trees. Today the fight is quieter.
   Court action has stopped construction since mid-1986.
   Opponents of the ``Ex-Pres.-Way,'' as they call it, have been in
court for years saying the noise, fumes and road-widening would
damage historic parks and neighborhoods including some designed by
pioneer urban landscaper Frederick Law Olmstead. The road also
would slice through a public golf course.
   Road advocates argue the road was part of the presidential
center package, that no more homes would be leveled, that it is
needed for safety reasons and would lessen traffic through the
older neighborhoods. They say the project would leave some Olmstead
parks untouched and trim two only slightly.
   They note that court decisions have agreed with the need and
with the environmental impact statements they have filed.
   Road opponents are awaiting word on whether the U.S. Supreme
Court will hear their appeal.
   Terry Adamson, lawyer for former President Carter who also does
work for the center, said that without the road part of the Carter
Center could be reclaimed because the center got the use of 27 of
the 30 acres of the library site from the state with the
understanding that the road would be built. The argument has been
used since the controversy began.
   ``It wasn't true then and it's not true now,'' countered R.M.
Ossoff, a leader of the anti-road movement.
   He said elected officials from U.S. senators to city councilmen
are overwhelmingly in favor of the Carter Center but that political
support for the road is dropping.
   ``Demonstrate to me how that much assembled influence could not
resolve in three seconds any problems the Presidential Center might
have,'' he said.
   The center already has landscaped the 27 acres at a cost of
about $4 million.
   The road was meant to facilitate access to the Carter
Presidential Center near downtown Atlanta, and when Carter proposed
the library he all but made the road a condition of the center
being in Atlanta.
   Opponents of the proposed 2.2-mile Presidential Parkway say
traffic through the area is short of predictions and that a
smoothly operating Carter Center belies the claim that the center
needs the road to function.
   Plans call for the four-lane road to have hiking trails, bike
paths and other park facilities alongside it, and proponents say it
actually will enhance the area.
   Olmstead designed New York City's Central Park, the grounds of
the U.S. Capitol, the ``Emerald Necklace'' of parks around Boston,
and Washington's Rock Creek Park. In the 1890s he designed five
parks in Atlanta.
   A 1985 bill requiring the National Park Service to make
recommendations for preserving Olmstead's work passed the House but
died in the Senate. In 1984 the Federal Highway Commission's
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation voted 12-4 against
building the road.
   Yard signs flourish near the proposed road: ``Save, Don't
Pave,'' ``Stop the Road'' and ``Build it in Plains'' _ the latter
referring to Carter's hometown of Plains, Ga.
   There have been attempts to put a road through the area for 20
years, and the state condemned land and destroyed over 500 houses
and businesses with that in mind in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Then, largely because of opposition from then-Gov. Jimmy Carter,
the plan died.
   The initial proposal for the Presidential Parkway was based
heavily on a projected traffic increase of more than 200 percent
over 20 years, but road opponents say the actual increase has been
closer to 10 percent.
   Carter Center officials predicted 1.2 million visitors a year
would come to the center. The total for the first year was about
175,000.
   ``Not one presidential library in the United States is on a
four-lane road and there is not any reason to believe that the
Jimmy Carter Library is going to draw any more visitors than the
JFK Library or the LBJ Library,'' opposition leader Sally Dorn said
at the height of the controversy.
   Neighborhood citizens groups formed CAUTION (Citizens Against
Unnecessary Thoroughfares In Older Neighborboods) in early 1982 to
coordinate the protest efforts.
   Ossoff, the first president of CAUTION, says the group has spent
more than $400,000 in legal fees and that donated legal services
have come to far more than that. Adamson said road proponents have
spent at least that much.
   Ossoff says the projected cost of the road has gone up from its
original $22 million to as high as $47 million, would use all of
Atlanta's federal highway fund allotment for years and would be
among the most expensive highways per mile ever built in Georgia.
   He said political support for the road seems to be on the wane
with fewer City Council members backing it and with Maynard Jackson
and Michael Lomax, the two front-runners for mayor in the 1989
elections, on record as opposing it.
   ``We need not revisit these issues,'' Adamson said, saying that
if the controversy were to start anew every time political opinion
changed, ``we would not get anything done.''

   A split, charred tree stump is a clue that
lightning was to blame for a forest fire. Carbon particles indicate
the exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit. And there are other
ways to tell a fire was accidental.
   ``You eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson,'' said
Dale Smallwood, a criminal investigator for Missouri's Mark Twain
National Forest.
   He comes down to arson in most of his investigations _ and he
and other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in
some regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames.
   A psychologist's study found economic and even aesthetic reasons
why some people light woods aflame.
   Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken
out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwood
said. A total of 14,200 acres of the forest, which covers 1.5
million acres mostly in southern Missouri, were burned during a
spring fire season made more volatile by drought.
   On average, Smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires
each year in Missouri are deliberately set.
   ``It's probably 90 percent higher than the national average,''
said Ron McDonald, Mark Twain's fire control officer. He said Mark
Twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the
worst arson problem.
   ``It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberately
set) fires,'' McDonald said.
   The tradition seems to stretch across the southern United
States, according to Smallwood. Fires in other areas are more
likely to be caused by lightning or man's carelessness.
   As one of the Forest Service's 125 special law enforcement
agents, Smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating
fires in the forests he loves. ``I consider myself an Ozark
hillbilly,'' he said.
   The Forest Service is charged with protecting wildlands, and
balancing recreational needs with commercial interests in timber
and mineral resources. Smallwood's job includes investigating
marijuana growing in the forest, timber theft and theft of other
federal property.
   His military-neat office at the Forest Service headquarters in
Rolla is decorated with game bird feathers, a picture of Smokey
Bear and a glass-doored bookcase lined with reports and text books.
The Forest Service has called on psychologists, sociologists and
archaeologists to determine why fires are set.
   ``Part of it is tradition,'' Smallwood said. ``In the
springtime, people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow.''
   A policy of open grazing, with cattle free to feed on any
unfenced land, was allowed in the Ozarks until the 1960s, longer
than in other wooded areas, Smallwood said.
   Psychologist John P. Shea in the 1940s conducted one of the
first Forest Service studies of arson.
   Subsistence farmers in the rural South who were interviewed by
Shea and his researchers claimed fire helped control ticks, snakes
and disease and controlled the encroachment of trees on land where
they wanted to graze cattle.
   ``Their ways are those of frontiersmen living in an arrested
frontier,'' Shea wrote.
   Aesthetics even played a part: Shea and other researchers found
that people living in areas where arson was common enjoyed the
smell of smoke in the spring air, and believed the woods looked
better ``burned clean.''
   The Forest Service has attempted to counter the lore that can
lead to burning.
   Over the years, timber has been touted as a cash crop that is as
worthy of protection as grassland. Smokey Bear and other programs
encourage the view of the forests as a priceless national resource.
   But the tradition of using fire to manage the woods dies hard.
``There's no cut-and-dried way to prevent it,'' McDonald said.
   ``We had one case (in 1984) where two men went to Sunday school
and after school they started a fire with their Sunday school
literature,'' Smallwood said. ``They just happened to be driving
through an area they thought needed to be burned out.''
   Still, the arsonist does not always fit the profile of a simply
misguided citizen.
   ``Part of the problem is people driving around drinking and
shooting road signs,'' Smallwood said. ``When they get bored with
that, they set fires. It's malicious mischief.
   ``Sometimes you hear that someone is angry at the Forest Service
because of some administrative action _ because we closed a road or
disallowed something. And they don't necessarily have to be mad at
the Forest Service. They could be mad at government, period.''
   Then, ``fire is used as retaliation.''
   ``It's so senseless,'' he said. ``It just costs a lot of money
to put these fires out and it's coming right out of our tax
dollars.''
   McDonald, who oversees about 125 Mark Twain employees trained as
firefighters, said forest fires cost $25 to $30 an acre to suppress.
   In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be
put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire
and replacing timber that was destroyed, Smallwood said. Last year,
a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the Forest
Service.
   ``An arson case in the forest is very hard to make,'' he said.
``When you go out in the middle of the forest to a blackened area
to begin an investigation, it's very difficult and frustrating. No.
1, you usually don't have any witnesses.''
   He noted that in some cases, people who have evidence withhold
it for fear of being burned out themselves.
   Beyond the cost in dollars of forest fires, there's risk to
those who fight them.
   ``We had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arson
fire,'' Smallwood said, referring to a 1976 blaze.
   ``We would have liked to have prosecuted someone in that case.
And I would have also liked to have known if the prosecutor would
have considered a manslaughter charge against the arsonist.''

<HEAD>First Amendment Battles Boil Over New Media Technologies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FELIX GUTIERREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CERRITOS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As developments change the the way
people communicate _ from cellular phones to interactive cable TV _
some regulators and lawmakers say the Constitution's protections of
traditional speech and press need to be restated for the new media.
   Police can legally eavesdrop on cellular telephone
conversations, even though it would be unlawful to tap the same
conversations over regular phone lines without a court order, said
UCLA communication studies Professor Jeff Cole.
   It's also legal to spy on the phone numbers dialed up by a home
computer.
   And here in Cerritos, people are frustrated by another
constititional quandary. They can't receive a futuristic cable
system that would provide at-home shopping and banking, not to
mention lots of television channels, until it's determined who has
a right to install it.
   ``We are going to have to figure out a way to ensure the First
Amendment survives the technological revolution,'' said Federal
Communications Commission public affairs director John Kamp.
   In the Cerritos case, an official of the FCC _ which regulates
broadcast media and some telephone services but not newspapers and
magazines _ recently approved the laying of cable by the local
telephone company, GTE, which won a contract from the city last
year.
   But cable industry groups have asked the full FCC to review the
matter and a decision is expected in the fall, said Michael Morris
of the California Cable Television Association. The industry cites
federal regulations banning telephone companies from operating
cable TV in cities where they run the phones.
   ``The residents are frustrated,'' said Michele Ogle, a
spokeswoman for this upscale Los Angeles suburb. ``They would like
to see cable television. The surrounding communities have it.''
   Some media experts are concerned for a different reason. They
think the First Amendment, guaranteeing free speech and press,
should keep local and federal governments from deciding who sends
or receives information by the new media.
   ``The phone companies, like any other citizen, enjoy a First
Amendment right to be speakers,'' said Patrick Maines of The Media
Institute in Washington, D.C.
   Cable television should have ``little or no regulation at the
federal or local level,'' he said.
   Maines' institute houses the First Amendment Center on the New
Media, which has filed legal briefs and comments with courts and
the FCC in eight cases it feels threaten the First Amendment rights
of new media such as cable television, telephone information
services and electronic publishing.
   Cole of UCLA compared the state of law and the new media to
``the Old West where there's no established law and order, anything
goes, and the biggest guy with the most power always wins.''
   Some argue that the First Amendment is meant to ensure many
media voices and that government rules encouraging competition
among new media help meet that goal, he said.
   Letting telephone companies offer electronic information on
their wires could give them an unfair advantage over potential
competitors, according to former FCC general counsel Henry Geller,
now head of the Washington Center for Public Policy Research.
   ``I don't want the phone company to be in cable television and
control 50 channels,'' Geller said.
   Future fiber optic transmission lines, which GTE would test in
Cerritos, could become a ``highway into the home'' carrying
telephone, television, and text messages, he said.
   Today's new media blur the lines between categories lawmakers
and judges have used for years.
   The First Amendment was written more than 200 years ago, when
print was the only mass medium. The nation's communication act was
passed in 1934, when radio and telephone concerns dominated.
   ``It used to be easy to tell the difference between newspapers
and telephones. Now it's not so easy,'' said the FCC's Kamp. Some
newspapers send electronic copies of stories to home computers over
phone lines.
   ``I see no difference between the Washington Post I pick up at
my doorstep and the Washington Post that comes in on my computer
modem, except that I don't get newsprint ink on my hands,'' said
Ken Allen of the Information Industry Association, a group of 650
companies ``that see information as their product.''
   ``They (new media) should have the same protections that the
First Amendment provides other information sources,'' said Allen.
But he cited cases ``where information that is put in a new media
suddenly loses all of its (First Amendment) protections.''
   California's Legislature this year considered a state
constitutional amendment extending state free speech and press
protections to computer communications. The bill passed the state
Assembly but was stalled in the Senate after law enforcement and
credit information companies voiced opposition, said Bob Jacobson,
a consultant to the Assembly committee.
   ``I think the likelihood of all forms of communication having
full First Amendment rights is the most likely course over time,''
said Everette Dennis of the Gannett Center for Media Studies in New
York. ``It may take a long time to happen. But it's an
inevitability.''

<HEAD>Do Cassandras Mismeasure the Economy?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy is now in its 69th month of
expansion, and according to a very popular view, three score and
ten is time sufficient _meaning the expansion should now roll over
and die.
   It is not a foolish concept, since aging expansions in years
past have always developed deteriorations similar to the organic,
muscular and osteo problems of human old age. But the concept is
perhaps overly simple.
   The average post-war economic expansion has averaged 45 months,
and ever since that average was surpassed two years ago the number
of Cassandras has grown. They view further growth as bad, a
recession as welcome.
   The reasoning is this: Factories are operating at near capacity
and cannot produce more; unemployment is down to the
scraping-the-bottom level, and that means job openings can be
filled only with less productive workers.
   Such measurements in the past have preceded inflation. Thus, a
recession is inevitable, and the sooner the better, the pessimists
argue.
   But some elements don't seem to fit.
   ``Growth needn't be inflationary if it is based on solid
productivity gains,'' says Prudential-Bache's Edward Yardeni, who
believes some notions about economic expansions, rather than
expansion itself, might be dated.
   Whereas the Cassandras fear that further growth will put too
much stress on the system, Yardeni and some others observe that
growth is what's needed to narrow the federal deficit.
   But what about the tight job market, ask the pessimists?
   To which those of more positive mind respond by calling
attention to the billions of dollars industry is spending on more
efficient plants and equipment, thus reducing the stress.
   In fact, economists of a positive bent point out, not all price
increases are inflationary. Why, they remind us, a price increase
accompanied by a bigger rise in product quality can actually be
anti-inflationary.
   Surprised by the persistence of economic expansion in spite of
their dire forecasts, some economists are now reviewing their basic
notions. They concede there is no better proof or disproof than the
economy itself.
   Incredibly, one factor that could explain the negativism is the
neglect of the newer, service sector of the economy, while
stressing the older industrial segment.
   Three-quarters of employment, 67 percent of gross national
product and 90 percent of new jobs are in the service sector.
Nevertheless, they figure less strongly in most analyses than do
older industrial measurements.
   Geoffrey H. Moore and Allan P. Layton of Columbia University
suggest that studies of the service sector do not always fit into
neatly constructed concepts of what the economy should be doing. In
short, there might be a built-in bias toward using industrial
rather than service indicators.
   They contend that ``one reason for this is that many of the
service industries have continued to grow during business cycle
contractions as well as expansions.''
   Therefore, ``indicators that skip recessions do not get a good
rating, and hence tend to be rejected.''
   Moore and Layton have developed service indicators for the
Center for International Business Research at Columbia, financed by
the Coalition of Service Industries. The first quarterly report has
just been issued.
   In that report, economist Allen Sinai analyzed the data and
concluded there will be continued expansion in the service sector
but at a somewhat slackened pace than had been so earlier in the
expansion.
   His conclusion: ``Service-sector economic activity is continuing
to expand nicely, but goods-sector activity is now driving the
economy.
   ``The pace of services economics has softened compared with
1987, but does not pose any difficulty for the overall economy or
job growth at this time.''

<HEAD>Woman's `Counterclockwise' Journey from Ad Exec to Counselor of
Poor</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARBARA ROSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Harlem is a long way from Madison Avenue
but Annie Troy has made what she calls the ``counterclockwise''
passage, choosing sacrifice among the poor over affluence in the ad
game.
   Ten years after she left Ohio for the big city, Troy had risen
to a $42,000-a-year job as creative supervisor of a large New York
advertising agency.
   She gave it up, and now, at 35, is executive director of Emmaus
House Inc., a work and counseling program for about 50 formerly
homeless people in East Harlem. She lives and works with them,
subsisting on the same $25-a-week allowance that they receive.
   In a neighborhood where gunfire keeps her indoors at night, Troy
spends much of her day running up and down stairs. Among walls hung
with pictures of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the pale, slight
redhead deals with everything from buying bathroom mirrors and
supervising food deliveries to finding a new drug counselor.
   In the 18 months she's lived at Emmaus, Troy has come to miss
her old neighborhood, her privacy and sometimes her old career. She
misses shopping and seeing her friends.
   ``The little things can become a real big treat now, like
getting together with a friend at a restaurant,'' she said. ``I
enjoyed the freedom of being able to buy what I wanted. ...
   ``But it's also a freedom in saying `OK, I think I have
enough.'''
   Three years ago, Troy lost a friend to AIDS. Searching for a way
to cope, she returned to church after a long break from her
Lutheran upbringing.
   In a sermon one day at St. George's Episcopal Church on East
16th Street, the priest discussed a man who established missions
for the poor and an integrated New York church in the 19th century.
The man, Stephen Tyng, was Troy's great-great-great-grandfather.
   Her astonishment at the coincidence of hearing about her
forebear in that church and her amazement at the breadth of his
accomplishments sparked a change in her. As she sat there, she
says, ``my eyes were opened to faith.''
   ``Most people don't need a religious experience,'' she said,
``but I guess I needed it to get my attention.''
   Troy began to spend her free time helping with mostly
administrative chores at a low-income housing construction project
on Manhattan's Lower East Side. After a month, they offered her a
job as assistant director, at a pay cut of more than 50 percent
from her advertising job. She accepted.
   Turning to the church had ``started my thinking going
counterclockwise to where it had been,'' she said. ``It didn't seem
like being competitive and making more money was really the thing
to put my time on anymore. ... I just started to think `if I'm
going to work this hard, maybe I could work this hard on something
that would really help people.'''
   Father David Kirk founded Emmaus in 1966; two years ago it moved
from a brownstone to what had been a hotel notorious for
prostitution and drug-dealing. Arsonists gutted the building twice
before Emmaus could move in. Now, Troy says, the dealers and
prostitutes join the 250 people fed in Emmaus' soup kitchen each
weekday.
   Kirk talks of how much simpler and quieter life at Emmaus used
to be, before homelessness and poverty intensified, before the
advent of crack cocaine.
   For a woman reared in a small town near Dayton, Emmaus was full
of revelations, despite what Troy already knew of New York.
   A drug addict would come to her room for a friendly chat _ and
leave with her watch. She felt betrayed until she sought guidance
from a drug counselor, who taught her to look beyond the lies and
manipulative behavior into the pain of a person bent only on
getting their next fix.
   When people go to serve the poor, says Troy, they're full of
romantic visions _ of rescuing lives, of finding a reward in
grateful faces. They soon learn that the changes take longer, that
successes are relative and that helpers, like those being helped,
are only human.
   ``If you try to live according to that dream,'' Troy said, ``you
get disappointed in yourself and in the others real fast.''
   This spring, after six weeks of daily struggles to get out of
bed, she recognized signs of the burnout that had hit her
predecessor. She left for two weeks at a farm and Catholic retreat
in Canada, where people are trained to work with the poor and
counseling is given to those who already do. On arrival they took
one look at her tired face and put her in the infirmary.
   A month or so later, Troy looks weary again. She says she rarely
thinks about returning to advertising, just occasionally when in a
``snit.'' But she won't try to predict where she might be 10 years
from now. ``Ten years ago,'' she says, ``I never would have dreamed
I'd be here.''
   Though she stays in touch with her family and though her
devoutly religious mother, in particular, supports what she does,
one of the hardest adjustments to life at Emmaus was losing touch
with her friends.
   Emergencies _ from a resident who's upset to a potential
knife-fight in the soup kitchen _ often interfere with Troy's
outside plans, and her friends are reluctant to visit in East
Harlem. When they do get together, there are awkward first moments
until they find themselves, once more, on equal ground.
   ``I guess there's something kind of odd,'' Troy said, ``about
this friend who leaves it all to go to work with the poor'' and who
becomes devout.
   But as she sees it, there can be as much stress in her old world
as she has now.
   At Emmaus, Troy said, her religious conviction has been
strengthened: ``There's so much that's beyond my ken or control, or
anybody's ability to help.''
   She turned to Roman Catholicism in October 1986, drawn by the
church's devotion to the Virgin Mary and the accessibility of its
weekday services.
   But her faith in human nature has suffered.
   ``I see the devastation that's happening with these people,''
she said, ``and I see on the other side people who are begrudging
even giving out that dime to somebody begging. ... I really see
that the problem is far more severe than I had ever thought.''
   ``Then,'' she said, ``I have to turn to the individual for my
hope.''

<HEAD>Congress Works To Save Last Free Stretch Of Columbia River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Columbia River rolls
lazily through the desert of central Washington, nourishing crops
and wildlife in what otherwise would be a wasteland of sagebrush
and barren hills.
   The river, which once roared through deep gorges, was
immortalized in Woody Guthrie's Depression-era song ``Roll On,
Columbia'' _
   ``Green Douglas fir where the waters cut through,
   Down her wild mountains and canyons she flew,
   Canadian North-west to the ocean so blue,
   It's roll on, Columbia, roll on!''
   But after the construction of more than a dozen dams in 51
years, the Columbia has rolled nearly to a standstill. For much of
its 1,214 miles, the river is a series of dams and slackwater
reservoirs, providing electricity, irrigation and flood control for
Washington, Oregon and Canada.
   The United States claims one last free-flowing stretch _ the
55-mile Hanford Reach _ and it too is facing major development.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing a $180 million
project to open the river to barge traffic all the way to
Wenatchee, so that logs, wheat and apples from the state's interior
can be floated to Pacific Ocean ports.
   The plan calls for dredging part of the river and building giant
lifts over three dams to allow navigation between Richland and
Wenatchee.
   Opponents say the dredging would forever ruin valuable fish and
wildlife habitat, archaeological sites and the last vestige of
natural river flow.
   Washington's congressional delegation has introduced legislation
to protect the area.
   The reach ``is one of the only areas where spawning habitats
remain undisturbed, nesting areas abound, and majestic cliffs
lining the river are mirrored in its quiet, deep calm,'' said Sen.
Dan Evans, R-Wash.
   ``We're telling them don't go ahead with these ill-conceived
plans until we know the impact on spawning and recreation, the most
important use of the river,'' said Republican Rep. Sid Morrison,
whose district includes the area.
   Under the bill, the Department of the Interior would protect the
Hanford Reach for eight years until a study determines whether to
permanently preserve the stretch under the Wild and Scenic Rivers
Act.
   The bill has already cleared the Senate but Morrison has delayed
House action while negotiations continue to address concerns of the
U.S. Department of Energy.
   That agency operates the Hanford nuclear reservation, a
sprawling plutonium-production site that straddles the river. The
Energy Department is worried the study could hamper Hanford
operations, said Terry Seeley, a legislative aide to Morrison.
   There lies the irony of the ``wild and scenic'' designation: as
the Columbia flows past nine federal nuclear reactors no one would
call the view pastoral.
   The huge, eerie reactors, technological marvels in their time,
produced much of the plutonium for the nation's nuclear weapons
arsenal. The slow-moving river creeps past the hulking reactors,
with pumping stations, razor-wire fences and guard towers casting
shadows over the water.
   Eight are closed permanently. The newest, the N Reactor, which
was placed on ``cold standby'' earlier this year because the
federal government no longer needed the plutonium, stands closest
to the river, a brooding presence amid the jumping fish, herons and
deer.
   Much of the shore is off-limits to recreational users because
the federal government wanted a buffer zone around its reactors.
   The Hanford Reach runs from Priest Rapids Dam, south of Mattawa,
to the reservoir of McNary Dam just north of Richland.
   The biggest objections to the dredging are that the movement of
a half-million cubic yards of dirt would destroy some of the last
wild runs of chinook salmon, which battle their way up river to
spawn.
   ``That's one of the few or perhaps the only remaining natural
spawning area in that entire river system below Grand Coulee (dam)
that salmon and steelhead can get too,'' said Jerry Neal, deputy
director the state Department of Wildlife.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has proposed building an artificial
salmon spawning channel, to compensate for areas lost to dredging.
But opponents say that would not work.
   ``Artificial spawning channels just don't provide the quantity
and quality of reproduction that the natural free-flowing river
provides,'' Neal said. ``The technology hasn't been that
well-perfected.''
   The dredging proposal has also run into stiff fiscal opposition.
   The cost-benefit ratio for the project currently stands at just
80 cents in benefits for every dollar spent, said George Sellar,
manager of water resources for the Port of Chelan County in
Wenatchee, which has been pushing the plan since the 1950s.
   The port and the Army are now studying the plan to try to make
it economically stronger.
   For instance, some people feel that large quantities of apples
could not be moved by barge because of the length of the trip, but
others say using refrigerated containers would keep them fresh,
Sellar said.
   The port hopes to save up to 40 percent in transportation costs
compared to rail or trucking. ``One barge will move the equivalent
of 50 to 60 trucks,'' Sellar said.

<HEAD>In Home of Tabasco, `Hot Sauces are Almost a Religion'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AVERY ISLAND, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roll down the car window anywhere near
the plant where Louisiana's most famous hot sauce still is made
from a century-old recipe, and your head just fills up with the
scent _ a little tomatoey, a little spicy, a lot hot.
   The odor is so much a part of the place that Paul C.P.
McIlhenny, whose family has been making Tabasco sauce from the
start, doesn't even notice it unless he's up close to the pulp
barrels.
   Hot sauce in southern Louisiana is like that smell. It's
everywhere. On every table in every restaurant. Two dozen or so
varieties. Louisiana hot sauce is a tourist attraction: It's on
posters and coffee mugs and key chains, and people take tours of
hot sauce factories.
   ``In the river parishes, where the Acadians first landed, its
hard not to find a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce on the table,''
said John Folse, a chef and restaurateur in Donaldsonville who
introduced Cajun food to Moscow during the summit meeting earlier
this year. ``It's almost like salt, pepper and Louisiana hot.''
   There is, of course, the theory that people who live in such
steamy heat eat hot foods to perspire and cool off.
   ``My mother's people and my father's people grew hot peppers
because they thought they were good for you,'' said television's
down-home Cajun chef, Justin Wilson.
   But there's much more than science at work in a land where what
to eat for dinner is often the focus of luncheon conversation and
what to eat tomorrow is the dinner-table talk. Good food really
matters here.
   ``When someone asks, `What are you doing this afternoon?, You
say, `Oh I don't know, maybe a crawfish boil.' They always think in
terms of cooking,'' said Folse.
   And most everything _ even to a bloody Mary sorbet, says Folse _
gets a dash or two of hot sauce.
   ``I don't think anything's worth a darn unless it's seasoned
well,'' said Wilson, who is partial to cayenne peppers.
   McIlhenny, 44, vice president of the McIlhenny Co., figures he
goes through a 2-ounce bottle a month of Tabasco, which, by the
way, is not a generic name, though McIlhenny's pleased if you think
so.
   Hot sauce is addictive, he said. ``I've had friends use it out
of loyalty, and then say, `Hey, this is good,' as if it was a
surprise. They say they get addicted.''
   So it's no surprise there are so many kinds _ Tabasco,
Trappey's, Tony Cachere's Creole Hot Sauce, Crystal Hot Sauce,
Cajun Chef, Louisiana Gold, Durkee Sauce, Panola Red, Cajun Power
Hot Sauce. You get the idea.
   A premium sauce, it's agreed, uses only the pepper pulp. No
seeds or skin. Most contain just salt, vinegar and peppers,
although some labels say it fancier. Crystal, for example, lists
``fresh ripe aged peppers,'' and Cajun Chef contains ``select
Louisiana cayenne peppers.''
   So, can connoisseurs distinguish among them?
   Sure, said Folse, noting that most chefs stock four of five
varieties.
   ``I've got items in my kitchen I use Tabasco on. However, I also
really like Louisiana Gold,'' he said. ``I don't find that it's
quite as hot as Tabasco ... and when you have five or six chefs on
the line, you want to have a little control. If they put one shot
or two shots, you don't want to change the flavor competely.''
   ``They all have a little different flavor, and they all use a
little different amounts of vinegar, salt,'' said Wilson. ``There
are certain ones I prefer. ... It's just a question of experience,
and God knows I have a lot of that.''
   The McIlhenny Co., too, has plenty of experience. Tabasco is
sold in 100 countries; it's been on space missions.
   ``We end up in strange places,'' said McIlhenny. ``I understand
two or three Sherpas in Nepal will use a bottle at a single meal.''
   Nepal is a long way from tiny Avery Island, 18 square miles that
are home to 700 people, the Tabasco plant and fields, a salt mine
and oil wells. There also are 100,000 snowy egrets, 30,000 azaleas
and 17,000 irises.
   Avery Island is not really an island, but a salt dome that rises
from the marshes and bayous on Louisiana's Gulf Coast. At 152 feet
above sea level, the island is the highest point along the gulf
from Mexico to Florida. It sits 150 miles from New Orleans,
separated by sugar cane, rice and oil fields.
   In 1818, John Craig Marsh obtained rights to part of the island,
and later a Louisiana judge, Daniel Dudley Avery, bought part. In
1837 Avery married Marsh's daughter and eventually obtained the
entire island.
   In 1859, Edmund McIlhenny married an Avery daughter. The story
is told, though not verified, that the family fled Avery Island in
the Civil War and returned to find everything destroyed _ except
one defiant pepper plant grown from a seed or seedling given to
Edmund by a friend returning from Mexico.
   What is known is that Edmund McIlhenny came up with a sauce to
perk up the bland food available during Reconstruction. n 1868, he
packed his invention in ladies' perfume bottles, and sent samples
off to 350 wholesalers. Two years later he had a patent, and in two
years more a London office to handle all the European orders.
   His sauce used a variety of Capsicum frutescens, a small
fire-engine-red pepper, of which the McIlhenny Co. today is the
world's largest producer. Tabasco is an Indian word for damp earth,
which McIlhenny apparently chose because he liked the sound of it.
   One hundred twenty years later, little has changed. McIlhenny is
still a family company, with Paul McIlhenny and two cousins in
charge. And Avery Island is their kingdom.
   ``This is an ideal site,'' said McIlhenny. ``Part of the
mystique is that only the soil, only the climate, only the nimble
fingers of Avery Island could pick Tabasco.''
   The peppers are harvested in summer, by hand, and must be
processed the same day.
   But today, only 10 percent of the peppers needed are grown on
the island. To protect against disease, pests, hurricanes and labor
troubles, seeds for the rest of the peppers are sent to Central and
South America. The mash is returned to Avery Island.
   Paul McIlhenny inspects every white oak barrel of mash for
aroma, color, particle size. He rejects one barrel in 100.
   The pulp is mashed with salt _ eight pounds to 100 pounds of
peppers _ and aged three years. The mash is then mixed with a
strong white vinegar and stirred mechanically for 28 days. Finally,
it is strained and bottled.
   And even then it's not just a bottle of sauce.
   ``Hot sauces in Louisiana are almost a religion,'' said Folse.
``You go to church on Sunday, hot sauce on Monday through Friday.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ As the Reagan administration's lease on the
White House runs out, so does George Shultz's tenure as secretary
of state. He leaves behind him no foreign policy ``doctrine,'' no
ringing rhetoric. But world affairs have changed significantly
during his stewardship, and now peace seems to be erupting in
unexpected places. Here's a portrait of a low-key diplomat who
seems to have been more concerned with the process than with
himself.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He sometimes talked about his job as
``pick-and-shovel work'' and himself as a ``gardener,'' images no
one would have pinned to the office that Henry Kissinger endowed
with jet-set glitter, John Foster Dulles with a prophetic edge, and
Dean Acheson with aristocratic elegance.
   Those three earlier secretaries of state over the past
half-century performed naturally on a floodlit stage that George
Shultz just as naturally avoids.
   Unlike them, he's never been the source of memorable quotations.
Despite his years as a Washington insider, he much resembles what
in fact he is: a Stanford University professor on leave.
   ``They've established a chair in my honor,'' he has said. ``I
told them that when I'm through with this job, I'll need a couch.''
   He'll be through in January, along with the administration he
serves, but its twilight is seeing a remarkable splurge of
peacemaking in U.S. diplomacy.
   Peace may be coming to Angola and southwestern Africa, where
preliminary agreements may point to the ultimate withdrawal of up
to 50,000 Cuban troops. Iran, in a startling turnabout, has
accepted a cease-fire in its war with Iraq. Soviet troops are
leaving Afghanistan. Pro-Soviet Vietnam is accelerating a military
withdrawal from Cambodia.
   Peace in Central America is more elusive and in the Middle East,
where Shultz has expended much effort, negotiations between
Israelis and Arabs seem as distant as ever.
   Shultz's interest in the Mideast antedates his appointment as
secretary of state. He is former president of the Bechtel group, an
international construction and engineering firm that made a fortune
in the Arab world.
   When President Reagan appointed Shultz in July 1982, his views
on the Middle East came under intense congressional scrutiny.
Against the apprehensions of some, he has emerged as one of
Israel's staunchest friends.
   On a recent visit to Amman, Shultz told a group of Jordanian
journalists that a total Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank was
``not in the cards,'' and neither was a Palestinian state.
   Traditionally, diplomats make cooing sounds in such
circumstances. Jordanian authorities never permitted the interview
to appear in print or on the air.
   Shultz, 67, will leave office without leaving a foreign policy
``doctrine'' or historic milestone associated with his name. Some
see his main accomplishment as secretary of state is keeping a
highly conservative administration on a moderate course in dealing
with the Soviet Union.
   His approach dovetailed with the rise to power in Moscow three
years ago of a pragmatic Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
U.S.-Soviet summit meetings are now annual occurrences.
   How much credit belongs to Shultz? How much to Gorbachev? And
how much to Reagan, who not so long ago called the Soviet Union an
``evil empire''?
   It's anybody's guess. But the fact is that the two sides signed
a historic treaty last year to abolish all U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles and to exchange inspectors to
ensure the deal is kept. The way was cleared in monthly meetings
between Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Moreover, there is a framework in place for the next president _
Democrat or Republican _ to make more weapons cutbacks and to
reconcile superpower differences around the world.
   ``So far as his recognition that there's been a fundamental
change in the Soviet Union, he's been a good influence in toning
down the president,'' said former Undersecretary of State George W.
Ball, otherwise a critic of Shultz, especially on the Middle East.
   Shultz also eased frictions with Congress and strengthened U.S.
ties with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and with Japan and
other Asian allies.
   ``He's been upfront,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``He's well liked by Congress. We
don't always agree with him. But the judgment on both sides of the
aisle is he's a good secretary of state.''
   Did Shultz try hard to talk Reagan out of sending American TOW
missiles to the Iranians in a futile attempt to free American
hostages in Lebanon?
   ``I wonder if there is more that I could have done,'' Shultz
said after the Iran-Contra scandal broke. ``I believe there was. I
don't give myself any plus on this.''
   Some on Capitol Hill are more critical. Rep. Robert G.
Toricelli, D-N.J., who heard him in closed testimony before the
House of Foreign Affairs Committee, says Shultz ``did more than
separate himself from White House policies on Iran. He built a wall
between himself and the White House.''
   Critics of the president's ambitious and, they say, fanciful
Star Wars project wonder if Shultz tried to slow the project down
and have found him ambiguous.
   Asked on national television whether he supported or opposed a
so-called ``broad interpretation'' of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty to allow debatable tests and early deployment,
Shultz played it close to the vest.
   The result was a headline in The New York Times the next morning
that ``Shultz Rules Out `Star Wars' Move Within Two Years'' and a
headline in The Washington Post, ``Shultz Accepts Broad View Of ABM
Pact.''
   Quizzed by Congress, Shultz was not much clearer. He said the
program should be deployed only after it was found to be effective
and worth the enormous investment in it.
   Was he subtly trying to slow down the program, which Caspar
Weinberger, then the defense secretary and a former Bechtel
colleague, was eager to deploy? Or was he for Star Wars full blast?
   ``I don't have a clear picture where he stands on Star Wars,''
former U.S. arms control director Paul Warnke says. ``I think he
felt this was the president's magnificent obsession and he wasn't
going to do anything about it.''
   But Warnke, an ardent proponent of arms control, gives Shultz
high grades for vigorously promoting the missile-ban treaty. ``He
definitely had his heart in arms control,'' Warnke says.
   Similarly, former Sen. J. William Fulbright, who practices law
in Washington and still keeps an eye on foreign policy trends, says
that what pleases him most is ``this move toward conciliation with
the Russians.''

   On the other hand, Fulbright, a former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, calls the hard-line U.S. policy in
Central America ``a great mistake.'' And in the Middle East, he
says, ``We've always been so completely supportive of Israel
there's not much chance of a compromise.''
   George Ball, who held an important State Department post in the
Kennedy administration, concurs. He faults Shultz for ``inepitude''
in trying to work out a deal between Israel and Lebanon in 1982
without consulting Syria, and then ignoring President Hafez Assad
for years because he didn't go along.
   Fascell credits Shultz with toughness and willingess to lay his
prestige on the line in Central America and the Middle East,
``although you can't say Lebanon was a success.'' There, 241 U.S.
servicemen were killed in October 1983 when a Marine command center
was blown up. U.S. peacekeeping forces, which critics said had been
foolishly exposed, were then withdrawn.
   Joseph Laitin, a longtime government press officer who worked
for Shultz at the Office and Management and Budget, tried to
explain Shultz this way:
   ``You have to remember the animal trainer describing how an
elephant moves. He puts one leg forward, shifts his body over to
that foot to see if it will hold him, then moves the next foot
forward. He never leaves his moorings in one place without having
another mooring. He's no great risk-taker.''
   The ringing declaration, the apocalyptic pronouncement were not
Shultz's style. He didn't convey the impression that the world's
fate hinged on his success in persuading foreign leaders to support
his policies.
   For six years, plodding through U.S.-Soviet, Middle East arms
control diplomacy, he methodically recited to reporters, ``You
don't have an agreement until you have an agreement,'' which seems
to echo baseball's Yogi Berra's, ``It ain't over till it's over.''
   But if reporters found the secretary less than electrifying,
neither did he play games with them, such as hiding behind
``background'' and not-for-attribution rituals in the ancient
Washington tradition. He said what he had to say on the record,
even when it meant admitting the failure of a high-stakes mission.
   And he persevered. He worked in behalf of Jews and other
minorities who were prevented from emigrating from the Soviet
Union. He made a point of giving human rights a ``pride of place''
on his agenda in all his sessions with Soviet leaders. He arranged
meetings with dissidents in Moscow and emigres in Jerusalem to lend
symbolic support to their cause.
   Low-key team player that he was much of the time, Shultz could
dissent sharply and publicly. He bristled at a White House order in
1985 to subject all government officials in sensitive positions to
lie detector tests. Shultz would have none of it personally and
threatened to resign unless the order was modified. It was.
   When Reagan two years ago decided to sell subsidized wheat to
the Soviet Union, Shultz called the sales ``ridiculous.'' Having
led the opposition within the administration, he kept up his
criticism after he lost. The Soviets, he said, must be chortling
over paying less for American-produced food than American
housewives.
   There was risk in such self-assertion. Shultz told the House and
Senate Iran-Contras investigating committees, ``You must be willing
to say goodbye, and I am.''
   He had offered to quit on two other occasions.
   One was in 1983 when he discovered that Robert C. McFarlane,
then the deputy national security adviser, had made a secret trip
to several Mideast states without Shultz's knowledge. He said he
told Reagan, ``Mr. President, you don't need a guy like me for
secretary of state if this is the way things are going to be done.''
   The other came in August 1986 when Shultz thought some
conservatives in the White House subjected him to ``a kind of
guerrilla warfare,'' to the point of hamstringing his authority to
use government aircraft for his State Department business.
   Shultz served in the Marines in World War II and met his wife,
Helena O'Brien, in Hawaii, where she was an Army nurse. They have
five children and five grandchildren.
   When Reagan asked Shultz to succeed Alexander Haig Jr. in June
1982, he was summoned from London, where he had been on a business
trip. Shultz was to meet with the president at Camp David, and he
found two limousines waiting for him at the airport. One was for
him, he was told, the other to take his wife wherever she wanted to
go while he had his interview with the president.
   Shultz waved off the second car. ``No, she will come with me,''
he said. ``We are a package deal.''
   He is the first man in history to have served in four Cabinet
posts _ State, Labor, Treasury and the Office of Management and
Budget _ 11 years in all of Cabinet service. A measure of his
aptitude for conciliation and avoiding controversy is that he held
three of these posts under Richard M. Nixon and emerged unscathed
by any of that administration's notoriety and scandal.
   Joseph Laitin's theory, shared by others, is that while Shultz
is a team player, he also has a well-developed ``protective
mechanism.''
   ``It was not that he was fighting them all the time,'' says
Laitin. ``There was an old-shoe relationship between Shultz and
Nixon. Shultz will go along, but at some point instinctively he'll
hunker down. He will not budge, because he's a man of character.''
   As secretary of the treasury, he disregarded a Nixon White House
request to have the Internal Revenue Service harass ``enemies'' of
the administration, provoking Nixon to unflattering comments. And
when Nixon complained about an IRS audit of his tax return, Shultz
told him that every recent president had been similarly audited.
   He showed no signs of winding down as his tenure neared its end.
So far this year, Shultz has made four trips to the Middle East,
three to the Soviet Union, and a 17-day swing through Asia.
   Why did he keep returning to the Mideast despite the refusal of
Israelis and Arabs to heed his plea to negotiate? Shultz explained
he didn't mind fighting long odds, and if he didn't succeed
himself, he wanted to lay some groundwork for his successor.
   Besides, he said, ``What am I saving myself for?''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Was there ever a golden era of sports in the dim
past, as touted by septuagenarian chroniclers? Maybe not, but
there's one right now. It's the PGA Senior Tour, where golf's
ancient rake in the lucre in post-career careers that lack the
pressure and cutthroat solemnity of youthful competition but make
up for it in sheer pleasure on the back nine of life.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   At times the senior scene seems lifted live from the frame of an
old Dutch golfing print, the whimsical kind you still find hanging
in country club corridors and locker rooms.
   Genial gentlemen of mellowing vintage in broad-brimmed hats and
knickerbockers bent over long crooked sticks in studious pursuit of
nudging a small white ball across a pleasant expanse of lawn. Or
perhaps these are Scottish shepherds who have lost their sheep in
the Highland heather.
   Weep no idle Tennysonian tears for a vanished yesteryear. These
are here and now maturing millionaires, some for the second time
around, playing the PGA Senior Tour, sports' biggest success story
in the past decade.
   ``It's a Mulligan on life, a chance for a second career at an
age when all other athletes are over the hill,'' exulted the
Australian Bruce Crampton, who made a million on the regular tour,
retired to hunt oil in Texas for eight years, then returned at age
50 to strike it rich again as a senior.
   In golf, a Mulligan is a second drive off the first tee, allowed
in friendly circles to compensate for a dismal start, but purely
illegal, even on the Senior tour where the over-50 set now competes
in a friendly way for official prize money in excess of $10 million.
   The lucre is so lucrative that last year no fewer than a dozen
seniors made more than in their regular career. At least a
half-dozen more are poised to join Crampton and seven other seniors
who already have won a million on the back nine of life.
   Here indeed is a new golden age of sport beyond the most
avaricious dreams of the actuarial tables.
   The ``Old Sarge'' Orville Moody, recently matriculated to the
millionaire class, is a splendid example of delayed golf growth.
Moody's only win in 17 years on the regular tour was the U.S. Open
in 1969. Prior to that, this part-Choctaw Indian spent l4 years in
the Army, rising to the envious rank of non-com in charge of golf
installations. Joining the seniors, he tucked a 50-inch long
putter, now affectionately known as ``the staff sergeant,'' tight
unto his sternum and began pendulum stroking putts that now
guarantee a more generous pension than the Pentagon had in mind.
   In physical contour, Moody more resembles Sgt. Snorkel in the
Beetle Bailey comic strip than your supple super jock. Senior
millionaires come in all sizes, from the well-rounded Billy Casper
and Miller Barber to lean and hungry exercise fanatics like
Crampton, a daily visitor to the physical fitness van in the
parking lot, and Gary Player, who still does 300 sit-ups a night on
the motel floor.
   But even with the choice of riding in carts, isn't it hot work
for chaps their age to be flailing away with woods and irons across
seven miles of uncooperating landscape for the better part of a
week?
   ``Playing golf is NOT hot work,'' demurs Chi Chi Rodriguez.
``Cutting sugar cane for a dollar a day, that's hot work, hotter
than my first wristwatch.''
   Chi Chi, who took up golf at 25 cents a bag as a caddy in his
native Puerto Rico, managed to match in less than 30 months at
senior play the million it took him 25 years to win on the regular
tour. ``Anything is possible in America,'' says this jovial
ambassador of the friendly, laid-back brand of golf that has made
the senior tour such a hit with the galleries and TV audiences.
   Instantly recognizable in his straw fedora, Chi Chi finds time
to chat with the fans behind the marshals' ropes, to autograph caps
and sun visors and visit with kids and old people in wheelchairs.
After sinking a 20-footer, he goes into his duelist act, wiping
imaginary blood from his putter and seemingly sheathing it like a
swordsman returning a sabre to its scabbard.
   Suddenly golf is fun again, in an age when so many younger
players come across as unsmiling, monosyllabic, computer-programmed
golfing machines, abandoning the color and drama to foreign players
like the fiery Spaniard, Seve Ballesteros, Australia's ``Great
White Shark'' Greg Norman, and Masters champion Sandy Lyle, the
slender Scot who deepened golf's mystique by revealing that his
girlfriend cured his tensions by tickling his feet.

   Gary Player, the South African gold miner's son who at 50 found
a new mother lode on the fairways, is convinced that in two years
the senior tour will outshine the regular PGA circuit when enduring
idols Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino reach their semi-centennial.
   This Mulligan on life enabled Gene Littler to put another
million toward his hobby of collecting Rolls Royces after a bout
with cancer almost ended a great career that at age 58 is still
rolling in putts and prize money. Larry Mowry, whose ``best friend
_ V.O. and coke'' betrayed him into dissipating early promise,
joined Alcoholics Anonymous and came back with white hair and a
steadier putting hand. He's become a consistent money winner among
the seniors.
   Riding a golf cart has enabled Charles Owens, the gutsy former
paratrooper, to earn a half million in the senior game after four
operations on his right knee, mangled in a jump at Fort Bragg.
   ``They're coming back from the dead; this is the greatest thing
that ever happened in any sport,'' says Robert Trent Jones, the
82-year old golf course architect who still tees it up to test out
his creations around the globe.
   All sorts of Walter Mitty dreams are played out on the back nine
of life.
   Walt Zembriski, a New Jersey steel worker who used to tiptoe out
on skyscraper girders, is now walking on air in the top-20 senior
money list.
   Among the born-again at 50 are Ben Smith, who spent l5 years in
the auto repair business, and Earl Boles, a former mortician.
   Ralph Terry, the Yankee righthander voted most valuable player
in the 1962 World Series, smiles out from bubblegum cards and takes
the mound at old-timers games at Cooperstown. But he's just a
novice on the senior tour, not yet in the prize money class with
John Brodie, quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers for l6 years,
who turned to golf as a third career after a decade in the NBC-TV
sports booth.
   Having your intellect scrambled by the likes of Big Daddy
Lipscomb and Rosey Grier can be wonderful conditioning for golf's
hard knocks. ``I've been up by three touchdowns and forgotten to
win,'' Brodie philosophized after blowing a two-stroke lead to Chi
Chi Rodriguez at Houston in April. ``In golf you just wait until
the end and add it up.''
   Resilience of this sort enabled Bill Ezinicki, former
left-winger with the Toronto Maple Leafs, to trade in his hockey
stick for a persimmon wood and win the New England Seniors title.
   Pros getting a mite long in the tooth but shorter on drives
competed long before the PGA formalized a seniors tour in 1980. In
1937, three years after he inaugurated the Masters, Bobby Jones of
Grand Slam fame gathered some friends, including 23 Scots, eight
Englishmen, two Irishmen and only four Americans, at Augusta
National for the first PGA Seniors Championship.
   The purse totaled $2,000, which was generous in an era when Sam
Snead got $45 a month to represent the Greenbrier resort on tour
and Walter Hagen tipped his caddy his entire check for winning the
British Open, $240.
   Dwight Eisenhower promulgated golf as a sport for all ages by
installing a putting green on the White House lawn and assigning
the Secret Service to shag balls at Augusta. But senior tournament
golf took off when NBC-TV in 1978 aired the finish of the first
Legends of Golf from Onion Creek in Austin, Texas. The brainchild
of producer Fred Raphael and Jimmy Demaret, that unforgettable
blithe spirit in purple saddle oxfords and polka-dot slacks, the
Legends had going for it a $400,000 purse, a team format pairing
the best of yesteryear and a thrilling three-birdie finale by Sam
Snead.
   The popularity of the Legends, which Bob Hope dubbed ``The Prune
Juice Open,'' prompted the PGA to add other senior events that soon
attracted corporate sponsors.
   Now there are 37 stops on the Senior PGA Tour, including the
Chrysler Cup, an international competition that recently
spotlighted Argentina's 65-year-ld Roberto de Vicenzo and Ireland's
63-year-old Christy O'Connor, and the Madza Champions, which pairs
the cream of the oldsters with the best of the women pros in quest
of a $500,000 team check.
   Many other events outside the tour include a TV senior skins
game, which featured 76-year-old Snead, and a growing foreign
circuit that already stretches from Rich River, Australia, to
Narita, Japan.
   Now that a golf course is being built at Nachabino outside
Moscow, this capitalistic opiate of the aging masses is sure to
spread to Tbilisi, capital of the Soviet Republic of Georgia, where
the comrades reputedly live to 140 and beyond. In no time at all,
Pravda will be covering the first Senior Centenary Classic.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Not unlike the reaction in the United States
after the Soviet Union launched the first Sputnik in 1957, the
Soviets have suddenly discovered that their schools are falling
behind. The Communist Party leadership is calling for reforms in
line with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ambitious drive to rebuild society

   In Uzbekistan in Soviet Central Asia, army inductees fresh out
of school are so poorly educated that they can't understand simple
orders in Russian, and even need to be taught how to brush their
teeth.
   Two hours a week, a class of 14-year-old Moscow boys dons blue
smocks and grinds bolts on aging metal lathes. Their female
classmates sew dresses, using treadle machines that would have been
familiar to their great-grandmothers.
   With surprising suddenness and unanimity reminiscent of the
panic in the United States after the first Sputnik launch in 1957,
Soviets have discovered that their schools now dispense largely
outdated and irrelevant learning, and that their country is falling
behind.
   ``I'm ashamed to say it, but my grandchildren study more or less
from the textbooks I used as a child before the war,'' one man
wrote earlier this year in the Communist Party daily Pravda.
   ``Ivan may know how to read, but he doesn't know how to program
a computer,'' says a Moscow-based Western diplomat who specializes
in Soviet education but asked not to be identified by name.
   The catalyst for the change is Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ambitious
drive to rebuild society and modernize and streamline the economy
to enable his nation to compete with the developed West. For
Gorbachev, the Soviet school is both a problem and a solution.
   ``We pin hopes for the future largely on the work of our school
_ which is only natural _ with its own restructuring, its own
teaching talents and the creative pursuits of the Soviet teacher,''
Gorbachev told a meeting of party leaders who met this year to
consider school reforms.
   Authorities are re-examining how the rigidly centralized
curriculum prepares the country's 57 million school pupils and
university students for life. They are even questioning whether
rote learning, long the mainstay of Soviet education, should not
yield at least in part to free debate.
   But officials say changing the system won't affect the school's
role in bringing up children with socialist values. How they will
reconcile that task with the promotion of a freer learning
environment is still an open question.
   In January 1984, party officials announced the country's schools
were being revamped to stress trade skills. Then-Education Minister
Mikhail A. Prokofiev said the objective was to double enrollment in
technical institutes.
   Those goals were opposed by many parents who wanted their
children to learn more than just a trade. That objective has now
been turned on its head, and a sense of urgency imparted by the
feeling that the Soviet Union is slipping further behind the West,
technologically, intellectually and culturally.
   Soviet achievements in space, theoretical science and high-tech
armaments are well-known, and the result of a network of state
institutes, think tanks and military-industrial agencies that
enlist many of the country's best brains. But for the vast majority
of Soviets, education has meant little more than vocational
training.
   ``The main task of the changes undertaken is to make school more
humanitarian, to give up the technocratic view that only technical
upbringing is necessary,'' Eduard D. Dneprov of the Soviet Academy
of Pedagogical Sciences said recently.
   Educators are debating whether a 10-year general education
course should be mandatory for all children, or whether most
youngsters should continue to be shunted into trade or vocational
institutes after eight years of schooling.
   More alarming for Soviets is the realization that even the
professional training given their children, like the courses in
bolt-grinding dispensed to some Moscow teens, may bear no relation
to job demands of the post-industrial age.
   Soviet schools now turn out 2.5 million skilled workers
annually, but officials say the instruction they receive often lags
behind innovations at the workplace.
   ``This means that the technological complexity of operations
grows at a much faster pace than the level of workers' skills,''
Yegor K. Ligachev, the No. 2 Kremlin leader, told the party meeting
on education in February.
   The inadequacy of job training extends to the most complex
professions. Yevgeny I. Chazov, minister of health, has told one
American researcher that 40 percent of Soviet medical school
graduates do not know how to read a cardiogram.

   The scale of the Kremlin's ambitions, and the problems it must
surmount, are evident in computer science and information
processing, a field once scorned as a bourgeois ``pseudo-science''
but now seen as vital to technological progress.
   By Kremlin decree, 98 percent of the country's general education
courses teach children about computers. But at last count, only 1.5
percent had the machines.
   In February, School No. 109 in southwest Moscow received 12
Soviet-made personal computers, but some of the squat black
machines have sat on a table in Yakov Z. Voronov's classroom for
more than three months because no one has been found to install
them.
   Despite the long wait, the math teacher is enthusiastic. ``Once
the kids do their lessons with the computers, the computer will
give them their grade,'' Voronov says. ``They'll love it.''
   That notion _ that learning should be fun _ is one Western
educators find conspicuously absent from the Soviet system, whose
textbooks are crammed with gray type and devoid of bright
illustrations and graphics.
   A far more prevalent attitude toward learning is expressed by
the Russian maxim, ``Repetition is the mother of knowledge.'' For
decades, memorization has been at the core of Soviet education.
   ``They know lots of facts,'' said Paul Kalkstein, an English
teacher at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., who taught
17-year-old Soviet exchange students last year. ``But they are
expected to be passive in class until their turn comes to read
something aloud, and that's not very often.''
   By age 15, students in Moscow physics teacher Gavriil A.
Braziler's class are plotting the movements of electrons and
protons through magnetic and electric fields. That doesn't mean
they understand what they are doing.
   ``They don't know what elementary particles are. But they learn
how to solve the problems,'' Braziler says.
   However, many Soviet educators say that the ability to
regurgitate answers is no longer enough to meet the confusing
demands of a changing world. ``I don't want them to say something
or believe something just because it's me who says it,'' says
Yevgeny A. Yamburg, principal of School 109.
   Yamburg concedes that ``for a mass of teachers, it's hard to get
used to students not all being in agreement.''
   The 3-million-strong corps of Soviet teachers and professors,
ritually lauded but poorly paid, has come in for special attention,
as well as criticism, under the reforms.
   To draw more qualified people to the profession, wages have been
raised. A beginning teacher, once paid about $150 a month, now
earns about $230. That's still well below the average factory
worker's wage of $330.
   A teachers congress has been called to set tougher standards for
the profession. The party's demand for educational reform had its
first institutional effect in March when the trio of ministries
overseeing Soviet schools was replaced by a single state committee
on education.
   In May, the head of the committee, Gennady A. Yagodin, canceled
final exams for 10th-graders in history, because their textbooks
had been outdated by media revelations about the crimes of Josef V.
Stalin and the corrupt reign of Leonid I. Brezhnev. A new
generation of textbooks more in tune with the spirit of
``glasnost,'' or openness, is now in the works.
   The Kremlin also recognizes the need to invest more in schools
themselves, 40 percent of which now lack basic plumbing. Ligachev
said schools for 28 million pupils will be built by the year 2000,
and that capital expenditures in education will increase
drastically.
   Despite the vast changes planned, officials stress that the
Soviet school will not abandon its role as the creator of future
citizens committed to following the Communist Party line.
   ``One of the tasks of the school in the U.S.S.R. is to bring up
Soviet boys and girls as dedicated champions of revolutionary ideas
and traditions, people who are striving and able to uphold and
implement the policy of the party,'' Ligachev said.
   For teens, that upbringing includes a course called ``Military
Preparation'' in which boys learn how to fire a rifle and maneuver
in trenches and girls study to be field nurses.
   In his speech to the Communist Party leadership, Ligachev
sounded a note of urgency by tying the fate of Gorbachev's entire
campaign for economic and social reform to changes made in Soviet
schools.
   ``The general educational and professional preparation of this
generation, the world outlook and moral values it will acquire _ on
this, to a large extent, depend ... the future of our country and
the fate of socialism itself,'' he said.

   On the lapel of his dark-blue school blazer, one
Moscow teen-ager wears a badge of Lenin, founder of the Soviet
Union.
   His classmate sports a button of Lennon, founder of the Beatles.
   Both are students at a school in the flatlands of southwestern
Moscow, where Yevgeny A. Yamburg is trying to encourage
wide-ranging inquiry and tolerance to help children cope with the
demands of modern Soviet society.
   In the three-story H-shaped building were Yamburg works as
principal, 1,500 pupils and 76 teachers meet six days a week in
split morning and afternoon sessions for the purpose of education.
   It is a business that Yamburg, 37, finds tremendously exciting.
   ``What we are trying to do is launch each child on an individual
trajectory for his development,'' says the Communist Party member,
himself a son of teachers. ``Children are like barrels. Some you
can fill up with just a little bit; others are bottomless. Each is
different.''
   Middle School No. 109, which sits in the middle of apartment
high-rises, is a synthesis of the traditional in Soviet education
and of the new possibilities now opening under Kremlin reforms.
   Yamburg says his is ``just an ordinary school,'' but Soviet
officials brought him to a Moscow news conference this year to talk
about changes needed in education nationwide.
   ``You can go to him with any question and get a sensible,
well-thought-out answer,'' says Tanya Litvinov, 15, a student at
Yamburg's school. ``He is open to us and to our problems.''
   One middle-aged Soviet visitor found School 109 strikingly
different from the schools he attended as a child. ``Most schools
in this country are like military barracks. This one is different,
and you see it right away.''
   As Yamburg lopes through his school's strawberry-colored halls,
children wish him good day, and he returns their greeting with a
smile.
   In one classroom, 9-year-old girls in brown uniforms and white
lace collars and boys in single-breasted blue blazers slowly repeat
as teacher Yevgenia N. Potapov introduces them to the complexities
of Russian spelling.
   Above the blackboard a red sign bearing the image of Vladimir I.
Lenin proclaims: ``Lenin is even now more alive than the living.''
   Up the stairs, a classroom of 15-year-olds openly disagree about
the role of Josef V. Stalin in the Soviet past.
   ``He had a lot to do with the industrialization and
collectivization of our country,'' says one blond-haired boy.
   ``Some consider him a criminal because he ruined our country's
economic system,'' says another.
   Yamburg relishes the debate.
   ``As someone who started life as a student of history, I feel my
chief task is to form non-conformist minds, so that children are
immune to mass manipulation,'' he tells a visiting reporter as he
puffs on a Vietnamese-made cigarette.
   The principal, with graying temples, also teaches history nine
hours a week, using recent newspaper and magazine articles because
textbooks have been outpaced by the official criticism now leveled
at Stalin.
   Yamburg also assigns his students to compare historical accounts
in Pravda, Izvestia and other Soviet newspapers and has discussed
the strengths and weaknesses of socialism and capitalism with them.
   ``We try to raise children to see all sides of the problem, then
to see the alternatives,'' Yamburg says. ``That's our ideal here.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's a rich outsider who wears a turban and a
scraggly beard, a product of a hippie commune where he converted to
the Sikh religion. But Pritam Singh, who is developing a $200
million residential community in Key West, Fla., seems to have the
enthusiastic support of the locals. His main concern is making too
much money.

<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The multimillionaire developing Key West's
choicest chunk of land, the city's biggest-ever real estate
project, is beset by a dilemma: Having clawed his way out of
poverty, he now fears his money will corrupt him.
   ``The habitual creation of wealth for its own sake destroys
souls,'' frets Pritam Singh, a 35-year-old
hippie-turned-capitalist, as he recounts King Midas' bitter lesson.
``I don't want that to happen to me.''
   Singh first dreamed up the $200 million ``small town'' he's
building years ago at a commune where he converted to the Sikh
faith.
   The 102-acre Truman Annex property, the site of President Harry
Truman's beloved ``Little White House'' winter retreat, became a
ghost town after the Navy retired it in 1974. The defunct Navy base
went to public auction in September 1986.
   Singh paid $17 million for a chance to fulfill his dream of a
19th century-style village of houses and condos where neighbors are
neighborly.
   But that's not all he's accomplishing in this overbuilt city,
where soaring real estate prices have made out-of-town developers
as welcome as hurricanes.
   When the Annex went to auction, city officials feared slick
outsiders concerned strictly with cash flow would replace historic
buildings with glitzy condos. Instead they got Singh, odd-looking
with his turban and trademark blue jeans, but with a reputation for
doing high-quality historic renovations in New England.
   Now the former poor boy is on his way to hero status among the
crusty locals here, known as ``Conchs.''
   Singh cultivated the Conchs last year by asking them how he
should develop his land. Hundreds obliged, packing town meetings to
tell him. He used some of the ideas and celebrated his
development's official opening last year by tossing a $35,000 party
for the locals.
   In April 1987, the mayor was among 300 guests at his traditional
Sikh wedding on the Little White House lawn. This Easter, he and
his wife invited local kids for an egg hunt. Singh dressed as the
Easter bunny and passed out goodies.
   Singh is building at least 125 ``affordable housing'' condos,
priced at under $100,000, well below the $225,000 to $700,000 of
the 126 other condos. Re-sale profits on affordable housing units,
meant for his employees, will be capped to keep out speculators.
   The first residents should start moving in at the end of this
year.
   Besides condos and 61 single-family lots, Singh is also building
a yacht club, marina and artists' retreat. On Sunset Island, a
short ferry ride across from his mainland property, he's building a
lagoon and 154-room hotel, and is importing Bahamian sand for a
beach.
   Some of the projects of Singh's Great Bay Co., which was founded
in 1978 and has offices in Portland, Maine, Boston and now Key
West, include the $11 million Inn By The Sea in Cape Elizabeth,
Maine; the $2 million Merchants Row retail complex, a renovation of
a 19th century seaport warehouse in Portland; the $3.1 million
Ammerdown Place apartment complex renovation, also in Portland; the
$2 million Petroleum Building in the historic design zone of Santa
Fe, N.M.
   Soon after the scraggly bearded Singh bought the Truman Annex,
he soothed city commissioners by whisking them by jet on a $10,000
trip to see the hotel and smaller projects near Portland.
Impressed, the commissioners promptly agreed to rewrite the city's
development plan so Singh could build 25 percent more units in Key
West.
   Locals are pleased that he's following Conch-style architecture
of porches, steep roofs, cupolas and widow walks.
   ``I think to a man, you'll find people pleased with everything
he's done,'' says former Monroe County Commissioner Wilhelmina
Harvey, a fourth-generation Conch.
   Singh's ``small town'' idea has also been a hit with buyers.
Since sales began March 7, the annex has nearly sold out of condos
and many of the single-family building lots are gone.
   ``The vital concept is interaction,'' Singh says. ``More and
more in America, people don't talk.''
   There will be no individual mail delivery in his community.
``We'll build our post office and all the people who live there
will pick up their own mail. It's going to have a porch with
chairs, a coffee machine. You can sit on the porch and meet your
neighbors, talk to each other, become friends.''

   The fast sales at the Annex don't surprise Key West real estate
agent Anthony Yaniz, who says prices there are par for this city,
about the size of Miami International Airport.
   ``We've been discovered,'' Yaniz says. ``Ernest Hemingway called
this place the St. Tropez of the poor. That's no longer true.''
Condos sell for $60,000 to at least $500,000, and a concrete block
house downtown, in need of repairs, brings about $150,000, he says.
   Ambiance is more important than squeezing in lots of condos, say
Singh and his buddy from his commune days, Stephen Josephs, now a
Truman Annex Co. vice president.
   ``I knew it was going to be an adventure,'' Josephs says. ``And
Pritam and I never gave up this dream of creating a community.''
   This will be the last major project he'll undertake, says Singh,
whose son was born at home here on his last birthday, December 22.
But he says he won't retire.
   ``Religion and his terror of being poor are his driving
factors,'' says John Cole, a Maine writer whose children were
friends with the developer before his conversion to Sikhism, whose
followers all take the surname ``Singh.''
   In those days, Singh was Paul LaBombard, a French Canadian. The
Fitchburg, Mass., native is the oldest of four sons. His parents
divorced and remarried each other four times. His mother worked at
a shoe factory.
   ``My family was extremely poor. Thursday was mustard
sandwiches'' for dinner, Singh says. College was ``not even an
option.''
   Later the family moved to Maine, where he attended Brunswick
High School. He sometimes stayed with friends, such as author
Cole's family.
   ``He wasn't a hell-raiser in an evil sense,'' says retired vice
principal Jack Caldwell, who remembers Singh well. ``I had to drive
him home quite often because we often had to suspend him for
skipping school. He hung around with a group that did quite a bit
of rebelling. But he was quite likable.''
   After graduation, Singh briefly bummed around in Key West, and
then moved to the commune where he met his first wife and converted
to Sikhism.
   Singh lived for about a year 16 years ago at a Sikh commune in
Amherst, Mass., called Guru Ram Dass Ashram. The Sikhs are
vegetarians and neither smoke nor drink.
   Singh was reared a Catholic, but ``I had a problem with the
ambiguities of religion. I never separated moral justice from
social justice.'' He rejected Buddism as atheistic, but liked the
Sikh religion from the start.
   ``Sikhism has one God. Women and men are equal,'' he said. In
1975, he traveled to the sect's Golden Temple in India ``to see if
it was real. I had a tremendous trip. Sikhs are real interesting
people. I felt justified in my belief.''
   What impressed him most in India was the Sikhs offering him food
and lodging, no questions asked. ``They didn't ask me for anything.
I couldn't believe it.'' His conversion was sealed.
   In 1979, he scraped up $7,500 to buy and renovate an apartment
house. From there, he developed a shopping center and soon he was
trying his Midas touch on restoring historic buildings, now his
specialty. By 1983, his marriage had disintegrated but his thriving
business had made him a millionaire.
   His family lives simply in a renovated Conch house on his land
here. Diapers dry on the line outside. Inside, hardwood floors are
covered with scatter rugs, and much of the furniture is white
wicker.
   There are no televisions in Singh's home, because he can't keep
his hands off them.
   ``Everytime I stay in a hotel, I turn on the TV. They're like
voodoo machines.''
   Instead, he spends about $1,000 a year on books and relaxes at
his farm in Vermont, which has a temple, waterfall, maple sugar
grove, and Japanese and English gardens. He keeps sheep and llamas.
   ``It's the place I do things I dreamed about doing.''
   Key West, Singh says, will be his home even after his
development is finished, probably in two years. Then the man with
the Midas touch will think about relaxing.
   ``I'm at a cusp. There has to be a balance. The question of
ethical livelihood is the thing I'm most interested in,'' Singh
says. ``I'd like to be involved in a way that I don't get eaten.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ There's no denying that Willie Bosket showed
early promise. By the time he was 15 he had killed two men _ ``for
the experience,'' as he put it. In his postgraduate work, Bosket
compiled a record of such violence that he'll probably spend the
rest of his life in prison, which is not the best of news to the
men who staff it.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WOODBOURNE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willie Bosket's meals are slipped into
his ``box'' of a prison cell through a slot cut into iron bars.
Video cameras monitor his every move, 24 hours a day.
   When Bosket leaves his cell for any reason, he must first stick
his feet through a slot to be manacled and then his hands to be
cuffed.
   Three prison guards watch him when he gets his daily hour of
exercise, alone in a small, fenced-in area. The prisoner's hands
and feet remain tied. The Woodbourne state prison guards keep
silent, under orders not even to talk to Bosket.
   Many people who've come into contact with the 25-year-old killer
think that treatment isn't rigorous enough.
   While there may be more infamous inmates in other prisons, and
even in New York State, where Mark David Chapman, the murderer of
John Lennon and Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz are doing their
time, no one is feared more within the system than Willie Bosket.
   ``I'm a monster the system created,'' Bosket told an Oneida
County courtroom last year when sentenced to 25 years to life as a
persistent felon. ``I'm a monster that's come back to haunt this
system and I will dog this system until it is in its grave.''
   To Dick Bischert, president of the state prison guards' union,
Bosket is a prime argument for the death penalty that New York
state does not have.
   ``He probably will kill somebody in the system,'' Bischert says.
``Hopefully, it won't be an employee.''
   The state went to extraordinary lengths to create a special cell
for Bosket after he attacked a security guard on April 16. Bosket
walked up behind Earl Porter in a Shawangunk state prison waiting
room and wordlessly plunged a homemade knife into the rookie
guard's back, says prison system spokesman James Flateau. A
newspaper reporter, interviewing Bosket, was watching. Porter
survived, and Bosket faces an attempted murder charge.
   It was only the latest entry in a long and violent criminal
dossier.
   Bosket grew up in Harlem, the product of a broken home. In a
perverse twist on an old tradition, he began following in the
footsteps of a father he never knew. Willie Bosket Sr. graduated
Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kansas while a federal prison
inmate and eventually died in an escape attempt.
   Willie Bosket was 10 when first sent to a detention home. By the
time he was 15 he had killed two men in New York City subway
robberies, shooting one in the face after he put up his hands in
surrender and another in the head when he had only pennies.
   Bosket said he killed ``for the experience.'' Tried as a
juvenile for the 1978 killings, he was sentenced to five years. He
gloated then that he knew he could have killed 100 people and his
sentence would have been the same.
   Amid public outcry, the New York Legislature changed state law
to allow juveniles as young as 13 to be tried as adults for murder.
   Bosket served his time in youth detention facilities, where he
set some kind of a record for ferocity. He cracked a guard's skull
with a pipe, assaulted two othger employees with a hammer, stabbed
a fellow inmate with a fork. Despite this he was back on the
streets in 1983.
   The next year, he shot and robbed a nearly blind, elderly man in
the subway and was sent to prison for a 3{- to 7-year term. He
became more intractable than ever. Before stabbing Porter, he was
cited for 26 incidents, including nine assaults on the prison
staff. Seven times he set his cell on fire.
   Like most prison guards, Jeff Bowers had already heard the
stories about Willie Bosket when he learned Bosket was being moved
to Woodbourne.
   ``My family was worried,'' says Bowers, married and the father
of three. ``I imagine every family would be worried if you had to
sit there one-on-one and deal with him.''
   At Woodbourne, Bosket is never left with just one guard.
   In November 1986, Bosket began kicking and punching a prison
guard while being taken to court, despite shackles at his hands and
feet. He attacked a second guard who came to the aid of his
colleague. Bosket had to be carried into the courtroom and later
that day tried to attack another guard with a razor blade he had
hidden in his pants.
   Bosket thrives on attention, prison officials say, and it's
probably no coincidence that Porter was stabbed in full view of
Matthew Worth, a newspaper reporter who was interviewing Bosket for
a book he planned to write about him.
   It was Worth's last of at least 25 interviews he says he
conducted after Bosket approached him at his trial and suggested
the book. Worth said the biography is now on hold.
   Bosket is intelligent and can be articulate, Worth says, and
talks a lot about his father and how he wound up in prison the same
way.
   ``He says he believes the system is largely responsible for his
behavior and he's now responding to the system the best way he
knows how and that's through violence,'' Worth says.
   Since Porter's stabbing, authorities have barred any interviews
with the prisoner. Bosket wrote to social worker Sylvia Honig,
asking to circulate a statement that described his condition as
``horrendous.''
   Honig says she worked with Bosket at a juvenile detention camp
after his subway attacks and now is ``like family'' to him.
   ``As soon as Willie gets to relate to someone, he's very nice to
them,'' she says. ``He's very nice to children, he's very
affectionate, he's charming. He only hurts people he doesn't know.''
   ``Bosket was put in his special security cell both to protect
those around him and the prisoner from himself,'' Flateau says.
Three adjoining cells were renovated to make Bosket's quarters. One
was emptied of furniture and equipped with a steel wall with a
plexiglass window. He speaks with the few visitors he's allowed
through a microphone.
   ``It's probably the most secure cell ever made for an inmate,''
says Bowers.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ More and more Americans keep tabs on their
health through a great variety of home testing kits. They can be
fine, medical authorities say, to call attention to symptoms, but
diagnosis _ finding the root of the problem _should be left to
physicians.

   When an Italian known to posterity as Sanctorius
invented the fever thermometer, it was a cumbersome water-based
device that didn't find much of a market, but it was the first step
toward the in-home testing kit.
   The thermometer made its debut in 1626. A few hundred years and
several eons of technology later, its descendants are on the way to
becoming a billion-dollar industry in the United States, where
staying healthy is a leading preoccupation.
   Today, from store shelves across the nation, consumers buy kits
to find their most fertile time of the month, check their blood
pressure or blood sugar levels, and screen themselves for possible
cancer of the colon or rectum.
   Americans are expected to spend some $616 million this year on
home testing kits. Some forecasters believe the figure will rise to
more than $1 billion a year in the 1990s, driven by new
technologies, a ``do-it-yourself'' philosophy among consumers, and
cost pressures on hospitals and physicians.
   But the government has closed the door, at least for now, on
home testing for AIDS. And regulators and medical authorities worry
about any home test that claims to diagnose a particular disease,
especially an infectious one, rather than just detect possible
symptoms.
   Since 1977, the Food and Drug Administration has approved more
than 100 home test kits for sale.
   Among the most popular kits, used in 1 percent of the nation's
homes, are those that let diabetics monitor blood sugar in urine or
blood. Americans will spend more than $200 million this year for
those kits or similar tests for urinary tract infection, according
to the New York market research firm of Find@SVP.
   Other kits and their expected sales this year include:
   _Devices for testing blood pressure, $128 million.
   _Pregnancy and ovulation detection kits, $97 million. In 1986
consumers bought 6.1 million pregnancy test kits and about 500,000
ovulation kits.
   _Tests that indicate blood in the stool, a sign of possible
colon or rectum cancer, $43 million.
   And the thermometer? Americans are expected to spend $57 million
this year on them, Find@SVP says.
   Medical authorities say home health testing is fine, but they
have some reservations.
   The American Medical Association believes the kits can help by
involving people in decisions about their own health and getting
them to doctors sooner if there is trouble, says William McGivney,
the AMA's director of technology assessment.
   But there is concern about diagnostic kits, which would be used
by people who have a symptom and are trying to find out what the
problem is. In this case, a false negative result _ in which the
test fails to detect the disease _ could make things worse by
encouraging the patient to ignore his condition, McGivney says.
   Tests must be especially accurate if a false negative result
presents a substantial risk to the user or other people, in the
case of infectious diseases, McGivney says.
   The FDA shares the concern about such kits, said Thomas
Tsakeris, deputy director of FDA's division of clinical and
laboratory devices in the Office of Device Evaluation.
   FDA is now reviewing a kit for strep throat that illustrates the
dilemma, he says.
   ``Naturally you want to get at that condition and perhaps reach
a population of infecteds you wouldn't normally reach,'' he says.
But ``if you have a high incidence of false negatives and the
condition persists, there's a public health risk there'' because
the strep bacteria could spread.
   FDA assesses candidate test kits case-by-case, looking for ``a
clear benefit that overcomes any reasonable risk,'' he says.
   No test is always accurate, and few tests in the home or
laboratory are sufficient to diagnose diseases by themselves even
when they produce an accurate result, he says.
   ``If you were to have a test performed in a doctor's office,
that test would probably be ordered...in light of other medical
information that the physician would use. It would be part of a
diagnostic examination,'' he says.
   ``Those tests are now being offered directly (to the public)
without the availability of the other diagnostic information the
physician would have.''
   The FDA blocked home kits for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in April when it essentially forbade kit developers from
collecting the data necessary for marketing approval. FDA officials
had expressed skepticism about home testing for AIDS, because it is
fatal and because federal guidelines say testing should be
accompanied by counseling.
   In general, Tsakeris said, the FDA wants test kits to work as
accurately in the hands of consumers as they do in the lab. Almost
all home use kits are based on tests originally used in clinical
laboratories, he says.
   A manufacturer might be able to justify approving a kit with
lesser performance if it is ``exquisitely simple,'' deals with a
substantial health concern and promises to encourage more people to
seek medical care, Tsakeris said. No approvals have been granted
yet on that basis.
   Several factors can reduce the accuracy of home test kits. The
test for blood in the stool, for example, has so much potential for
wrong results that a doctor should supervise its use, says Joann
Schellenbach, spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society.
   Inaccurate positive or negative readings can occur if a person's
diet is not adjusted for two days before the test. It can give a
false positive reading if the person has taken a lot of aspirin,
had his teeth cleaned or just eaten a rare steak, she said.
   Such cautions are explained in material accompanying the kits,
but people tend to ignore them, she says. The instructions are more
likely to be followed on a doctor's advice, she says.
   In all, the cancer society considers the kits of only limited
use, she says, and physician exams are the best way to detect early
colon or rectum cancer.
   But the test kits may be valuable when people just won't go to
the doctor unless the home test gives them reason to, she says.

   NEW YORK (AP) _ Here are some suggestions for using home health
testing kits:
   _Do not buy or use a kit after its expiration date.
   _Look for and follow any directions on storage, such as
protection from heat, cold and sunlight.
   _Read instructions through once to learn what the test can do
and cannot do, then re-read them to understand each step.
   _Follow precautions carefully, such as those about avoiding
certain foods, drugs or activities.
   _Do not omit any steps in the test procedure. If a step must be
timed, use a stopwatch or at least a watch with a second hand.
   _If any instructions are unclear, check the labeling for a
telephone number to call to get answers. Or ask a doctor or
pharmacist.
   _Blood-pressure devices with a dial reading or a digital readout
should be checked for accuracy by a trained technician at least
once a year.
   _ Before measuring your blood pressure, choose a quiet room,
refrain from smoking for at least 30 minutes, and rest comfortably
for about 10 minutes.

   The first time David Selby kissed a girl on
the stage his schoolmates teased him so relentlessly he almost quit
acting.
   That was in the ninth grade.
   ``It took me a while to get over it,'' says Selby, who stars in
the four-hour miniseries ``King of the Olympics: The Lives and
Loves of Avery Brundage.''
   While Selby temporarily gave up the theater, his faculty adviser
at the University of West Virginia suggested that he enroll in an
acting course.
   ``I took it and I've never looked back,'' he says. ``It was a
lifesaver. It gave me such an outlook.''
   Selby, who has spent a large part of his career on Broadway, is
probably best known as Richard Channing, the charming cad on the
CBS prime-time soap opera ``Falcon Crest,''
   In the new miniseries, which will be televised on the Harmony
Premiere Network in two parts between Aug. 15 and Sept. 15 on 85
stations, Selby has the title role as Avery Brundage.
   Brundage devoted more than 50 years to his dream of an Olympics
that was free of political and economic influences. He was a
controversial figure who made some enemies with his combative style
and autocratic rule as president of the International Olympic
Committee.
   He participated in the 1912 Summer Games at Stockholm, but lost
in every event to Jim Thorpe. He hoped to participate again in
1916, but the games were canceled by World War I. In 1952, Brundage
became president of the Olympics.
   The miniseries also reveals that although Brundage was married,
he kept a mistress in Europe and had two children by her.
   ``They sent me the Brundage script and we talked back and
forth,'' says Selby. ``The more I learned about Brundage the more I
admired him and his energy and the way he raised himself up from
his poor beginning. I loved his passion for the Olympics. It was
wonderful to play a man with such a strong belief.
   ``We only had four hours, so we had to strike a balance between
the Olympics and his personal life. His mistress, who's still
alive, was interviewed for the series.
   ``Brundage became an engineer and builder who put up much of the
Chicago skyline. He was a handball champion when he was 60. Doctors
kept telling him he was overworking, and he kept saying that other
doctors who had told him that were all dead.''
   The series also stars Sybil Maas as his wife, Elizabeth, Renee
Soutendijk as his mistress, Linnea Dresden, Kristoffer Tabori as
his alcoholic younger brother, Chester, Pat Starr as his mother,
Minnie, and Shelagh McLeod as his secretary, Frances Blakely. Lee
Philips directed from a screenplay by William Wood.
   Selby was born and raised in West Virginia, where his family has
a farm that has been in the family since 1660.
   ``The place was totally self-sufficient,'' he says. ``We raised
all of our own food, had a cherry and apple orchard and a little
coal mine where we got enough coal to heat the farm. An uncle on
the next farm had a dairy. My parents still live in a house in
Morgantown built with timber grown on the farm and made into lumber
in our own sawmill.''
   At the university, Selby became so consumed by acting that at
one point he quit school to go to New York. ``I had $25 in my
pocket and the first thing I did was pay $19 for a ticket to `The
Sound of Music,''' he says. ``I went back to college with my tail
between my legs.''
   After graduation, he spent eight months with the famous Barter
Theater in Abbingdon, Va., then nine months at the Cleveland
Playhouse.
   ``The Barter Theater was originally founded on the barter
system,'' he says. ``One day a girl came and traded two cats for a
ticket. I kept that calico cat for 19 years. I named her Safronia
Clandon Selby.''
   When he finally moved to New York to stay he not only began to
get parts on the stage but landed a role as a werewolf in the campy
soap opera ``Dark Shadows.''
   Selby was in such movies as ``Rich and Famous,'' ``Up the
Sandbox,'' ``Supercops,'' ``Rich Kids'' and ``Raise the Titanic.''
   ``I had been commuting to Los Angeles for years for film roles
and made the move about five years ago,'' he says. ``I needed to
change directions. I wasn't getting the right film roles. One day I
got a call from Lorimar. They needed a new character for `Flamingo
Road.' I only did a few shows and it was canceled.
   ``By then Earl Hamner was doing `Falcon Crest.' I had known him
from working on `The Waltons.' He said I was the only character to
ever kiss Mrs. Walton. Earl and I got along good. We told the same
stories. So Earl created the part of Richard Channing for me and I
joined the show in its second season.'''

   Martha Clarke has some tips for the audiences
watching her latest dream-like _ some would say nightmarish _
experimental theater production, ``Miracolo d'Amore.''
   ``It should be looked at the way one listens to music or the way
one would look at a symbolist or surreal painting, or interpreted
the way one might a stream-of-consciousness poem, where it is
highly imagistic and maybe metaphysical,'' says the show's creator.
   ``Miracolo d'Amore,'' which has 15 performers, played in May at
the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., then opened June 14 at
the off-Broadway Public Theater here. Most New York performances
have been sold out.
   Men wear the white costumes and tall caps of Tiepolo's
Punchinello drawings. At the beginning, women are nude and playing
a circle game denoting innocence. Their costumes make them look
like flowers, based on sketches by J.J. Grandville. There is
singing and talking, in pidgin Italian, embraces with a skeleton,
loneliness, gang rape, fighting.
   ``I meant the title (``The Miracle of Love'') ironically,'' Miss
Clarke says.
   Miss Clarke is known for experimental theater pieces, a
succession of scenes, usually around an hour in length, inspired by
art and culture, where theatergoers' ideas of what she ``meant''
vary widely.
   ``Miracolo d'Amore,'' is her least-literal, she says, and it may
be her last.
   ``I think it's a difficult piece for people,'' she says. ``They
can't come out being able to say exactly what it is. It has to be a
subjective experience for the viewer, because it is an emotional
work and it is a sad work. It's kind of a meditation on love gone
wrong.
   ``The people who don't get it at all are angered by it and
dismiss it. I think it makes them frustrated. I'm afraid I always
feel in trouble with people looking for literal or intellectual
ideas in my work.
   ``Of the people who like it, somewhere it touches a deep
emotional response in their own minds or dreams. People can be open
to it and not feel they have to understand in a literal sense.
Dreams have magic.''
   ``The Garden of Earthly Delights'' in 1984 was Miss Clarke's
interpretation of a Hieronymous Bosch painting of heaven and hell.
It had dancers flying over the audience on wires.
   ``Vienna: Lusthaus'' in 1986 showed the elegance and decadence,
in which one might see seeds of fascism, of Vienna at the turn of
the century.
   ``The Hunger Artist'' in 1987 was taken from starvation in Franz
Kafka's writings and emotional starvation of his life.
   Miss Clarke started ``Miracolo d'Amore'' a year and a half ago.
``It went in an unpredictable direction,'' she says. ``You never
know where they're going till you've gotten there. I read a lot of
Italo Calvino fairy tales, to be inhabited by Punchinellos and
these flower fairies. The stories were very dark, horrifying, funny
_ and impossible to translate to stage. I gave up on them real
quickly. And New York seemed glutted with fairy tales at the time.
   ``Then I just started working with my company in improvising
themes on primal emotions. There are elements of fairytale in it
but fractured and shattered.''
   She isn't working on another one. ``I don't want to do this any
more,'' she says. ``It's not a matter of success or failure. It's a
matter of my own growth not to stay still and repeat. I want to
explore and direct opera next. I want to get into film directing _
specific, literal stories. I'm now ready to go linear.''
   In July, she went to London to talk to Peter Hall about possibly
doing movement for a co-production planned by the Glyndebourne
Opera Festival and the Houston Grand Opera. ``It is a discussion,
not a job, at this point,'' she says.
   Miss Clarke studied modern dance at the Juilliard School, was a
member of Anna Sokolow's dance company for three years, then the
Philobolus Dance Theater from 1972 to '78. She founded her own
dance company, Crowsnest, before moving into experimental theater.
   She lives in Connecticut, divorced from sculptor Philip
Grausman. Her son, David, is 19 and studies jazz composition.
   ``Garden,'' probably her best-known work, was revived
off-Broadway in 1987. It has been on tour and will tour again next
year. ``Vienna'' will tour this fall to Spain, Portugal and France.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Pascali's Island''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Basil Pascali is an informer by profession. He lives alone on
the eastern Mediterranean island of Nisi, an outpost of Turkey's
crumbling Ottoman Empire.
   For years he has earned a small stipend for writing regular
letters to Turkey's sultan, reporting news, gossip and potential
dangers to the government. To Pascali's great distress, he never
receives a reply.
   Ben Kingsley portrays the frustrated spy in ``Pascali's
Island,'' and it is another superior chracterization for him, more
complex and human than his Academy Award-winning ``Gandhi.''
   Kinglsey, Charles Dance, Helen Mirrin and a largely British cast
create a fascinating tale of intrigue and duplicity.
   The writer-director is James Dearden, who wrote ``Fatal
Attraction.'' He adapted Barry Unsworth's novel with equal skill
and makes his feature-film debut as director with ``Pascali's
Island.'' Deardon had directed a short film, ``Diversions,'' which
he expanded into ``Fatal Attraction.''
   The film, like the novel, is told through Pascali's eyes. He is
ever alert to newcomers on the island, and he offers his services
to urbane Britisher Anthony Bowles (Dance), who claims to be an
archeologist. Pascali soon divines that Bowles has other motives
than searching for ancient artifacts. The visitor also has eyes for
a painter (Mirrin), with whom Pascali has secretly been in love for
years.
   The cast of characters is as varied and devious as any since
John Huston's conspirators in ``The Maltese Falcon'' and ``Beat the
Devil.'' Everyone has an angle, whether it is Dance, who is
attempting a confidence scheme; the pasha, who is looking for
graft; the American, who is supplying arms to rebels; or the
German, who is seeking to extend his country's empire.
   Pascali perceives it all, and he sends his impassioned reports
to the sultan. No answer. Ever the informer, Pascali finally brings
a crushing climax to the con man's game. It is a violent and
disconcerting finale, inevitable perhaps, but jarring.
   Kingsley continues to amaze with his capacity for assuming the
skin of his characters. Dance is perfectly cast as the charming
scoundrel, and Miss Mirrin is seductive as well as cerebral.
   ``Pascali's Island'' was filmed on the Greek island of Simi and
on the island of Rhodes, and their deep-blue coasts and winding
streets are depicted with rare beauty by cinematographer Roger
Deakins (``Sid and Nancy'').
   The Avenue Pictures release was produced by Eric Fellner. The
rating is PG-13, with some bedroom and bathhouse scenes. Running
time: 101 minutes.

   Hold onto your machetes, folks, and don't let
your goalie masks down. Jason's back.
   That human slice-and-dice machine who put Camp Crystal Lake on
the map will be in your video stores in seven movies that have
grossed over $172 million: The ``Friday the 13th'' series.
   Paramount Home Video will have a package this fall featuring the
first six movies in the series at a special $19.95 price. ``Friday
the 13th Part VII _ The New Blood'' will sell for $89.95 in VHS and
$29.95 in beta.
   Jason began his rampageous career quite modestly in 1980, in a
low-budget thriller created by producer-director Sean Cunningham.
Ironically, Cunningham devised the title when he was planning a
children's TV show. He thought it might work for the title of a
feature film, and ``Friday the 13th'' grossed an amazing $40
million.
   The action takes place at Camp Crystal Lake. Jason returns from
the dead, wearing a goalie mask and wielding an ax or machete to
pay back a grudge. Many years ago when he was a camper he drowned
in the lake because his inattentive counselors were making love in
the bushes. Jason's vengeance is wreaked upon the human race in
general, but he takes special delight in whacking oversexed
counselors.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Raw'' and ``For Keeps.''

   ``Raw'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS _ $89.95, Beta _ $29.95;
Rated R)
   
   ``Raw'' is the technical result of an Eddie Murphy performance
at New York's Felt Forum, and it is aptly titled. It seems that
Murphy went to the Richard Pryor school of comedy and emerged with
a doctorate in dirtyspeak.
   The video opens at a family Thanksgiving gathering in the 1960s.
After dinner, a few of the youngsters give a talent show for their
adoring parents. Eddie the child tells a scatological joke, raising
eyebrows from the grownups and providing a fast seque to 1987 and
his stage show.
   Murphy's routines are pat and almost formula by now, with
predictable swipes at women, marriage, sex, homosexuals and various
ethnic groups. Occasionally, he's funny.
   He gives a great imitation of Bill Cosby, who allegedly called
him on the phone one day to tell him that dirty words do not a
comic make. He also does good impersonations of Mr. T and Richard
Pryor.
   ``Raw,'' however, is strictly for connoisseurs of Eddie Murphy's
brash narcissism.

   ``For Keeps'' (RCA@Columbia Pictures Home Video; VHS@Beta,
$89.95; Rated PG-13)
   
   Darcy Elliot and Stan Bobrucz are on top of the world: They're
madly in love with a sun-filled future. She's an aspiring writer
who's about to get on the college newspaper, and he's waiting for a
scholarship so he can go to Cal Tech.
   Everything is as rosy as life can be for bubbly, optimistic
teen-agers. Then Darcy becomes pregnant.
   Rather than go through with an abortion and continue chasing her
goals, Darcy (Molly Ringwald) decides to have the baby and marry
Stan (Randall Batinkoff).
   Their idea of marriage, though, is as idyllic as a TV sitcom:
neither realizes the realities, and they face financial tortures,
social snubs and a crumbling relationship.
   Darcy is not allowed to complete her senior year in high school
and must take an adult education class at night; Stan gets his
scholarship but decides to turn it down so he can work in a shoe
store and be a father. By the time the baby comes, Darcy doesn't
even want to hold it.
   In the end, all works out through some personal sacrifice and a
lot of growing up.
   Directed by John G. Alvidsen, ``For Keeps'' is surprisingly
good, escaping the silliness that usually invades movies about teen
social problems. Alvidsen is lean and focuses on the harsh
realities and the human, comic gifts that get most people through a
crisis.
   ``For Keeps'' is especially good viewing for those teen-agers
who think that having a baby _ with or without a marriage _ is a
nifty idea. They'll quickly learn what dicey really means.

   ``Panther (Yauarete)'' (Columbia) _ Milton Nascimento
   
   Milton Nascimento has a unique ability to combine primitive,
folk-like melodies with sophisticated, jazz-inspired harmonies. The
result is music of unusual depth and complexity, with moods ranging
from jubilant to mournful.
   ``Yauarete'' contains a diverse collection of Nascimento's
latest compositions. It can be listened to either as a showcase of
those compositions, or as the evocative performance of one of
Brazil's most moving singers.
   On the one hand, the freshness and originality of the 11 songs
on the album attest to Nascimento's seemingly inexhaustible
creative energy and the breadth of his talent. ``Meu Mestre Coracao
(Heart Is My Master),'' a deftly engaging bossa nova, follows a
meditative excursion entitled ``Cidade Encantada (Enchanted City).''
   ``Cancoes E Moments (Songs and Moments)'' is a short, repeating
refrain that Nascimento has recently used as a closing number
during live performances, leaving the audience quietly singing it
as he and the band gradually drift offstage. Each song on the
record is different, and each reveals another facet of Nascimento's
compositional skill.
   Even if Nascimento hadn't written the songs, however, this album
would be remarkable merely for his performances. His voice is rough
but powerful, and it is often tinged with a bittersweet longing.
With one exception, the songs on ``Yauarete'' are sung in
Portuguese, but the feeling in Nascimento's voice carries across
the language barrier. Columbia has, however, printed English
translations alongside the Portuguese lyrics on the album's inner
sleeve. (Nascimento works closely with several lyricists who
generally supply the words to go with his music.)

<HEAD>Star Watch: 1988 Is the Year of Barbara Hershey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After winning two consecutive best-actress
awards from the Cannes Film Festival, Barbara Hershey seems ready
for what her supporters believe is an overdue nod from the Motion
Picture Academy.
   It could have happened last year as the bayou mother in ``Shy
People,'' for which she won her first Cannes prize. But as she
herself admits, nobody saw the picture.
   This year Hershey was co-winner for her portrayal as the
anti-apartheid activist in ``A World Apart.'' That could be her run
for an Academy Award. Or maybe, if the Academy voters dare, as Mary
Magdalene in ``The Last Temptation of Christ.'' Or maybe for a
comedy role in ``Beaches,'' which she is now filming with Bette
Midler.
   In any case, 1988 appears to be the year of Barbara Hershey.
   She has been in films since her debut in 1968 with Doris Day in
``With Six You Get Eggroll.''
   Hollywood refused to take her seriously after she became Barbara
Seagull during a free-form liaison with David Carradine, which
resulted in a son, named Free. Still, she had a series of
impressive performances in ``Last Summer,'' ``The Baby Maker,''
``Box Car Bertha'' and ``The Stunt Man.''
   Producers began to take notice with ``The Right Stuff'' and
``The Natural.'' But her real turning point was Woody Allen's
``Hannah and Her Sisters.''
   ``That put me on those terrible lists,'' she remarked, referring
to the film world's elite of ``bankable'' stars. ``All of a sudden
I was OK to hire.''
   Typical of Hershey, she continues accepting non-mainstream films
and devoting excessive time to research them. For ``Shy People,''
she traveled to the backwater bayous of Louisiana and studied the
Cajun speech and lifestyle. For ``A World Apart,'' she interviewed
relatives and friends of Ruth First, her character in the film.
   First, a journalist and political activist, was imprisoned in
1963 under South Africa's 90-day Detention Act, the first white
woman to be so punished. The script was written by Shawn Slovo, who
is portrayed in the film as a 13-year-old girl. First remained an
activist in exile, and in 1982 was killed by a letter bomb.
   ``She was a great woman, but she wasn't an easy woman to those
around her,'' said the actress at the Santa Monica canyon home she
shares with her son, now called Tom. ``The fascinating thing I
found in all my interviews was that each person had different views
of her. That confounded me but ultimately liberated me.
   ``I realized sadly that I couldn't please them all. I decided to
take what I thought would say the most. She was a complicated
person, and my admiration for her grew and grew.
   ``One of the things I loved about her was that she loved to
dress. Even in prison she wanted lipstick over food. It was very
important for her to look elegant and have her hair done, contrary
to our usual views of activists. She loved to wear dark glasses.
Even working at her typewriter late at night, she wore dark
glasses.''
   Like Richard Attenborough's ``Cry Freedom,'' ``A World Apart''
was filmed in Zimbabwe. Conditions were primitive, but Hershey
didn't complain: ``That fused with what we were doing; I kind of
welcomed the adverse conditions.''
   The actress is well aware of the growing furor over ``The Last
Temptation of Christ,'' which has been attacked by religious
fundamentalists as being potentially sacrilegious and blasphemous.
   ``I guess it was the greatest experience of my life so far,''
Hershey said. ``The film meant so much to me and so much to Marty
(Scorsese). Like things that mean so much, it's a little sad to
talk about. I haven't seen it. But my feelings about it are that it
must be great, simply great.
   ``I read the book by (Nikos) Kazantzakis when I was 20, and it
became my favorite book. I was moved, as I never had been before,
by the Christ story. I finally got it. To get to make it after all
these years is really something.
   ``If you don't like the book, I don't think you'll like the
film,'' she said. ``All I can say is that I know why we made the
film: We made it not to thumb our noses at anybody or anybody's
religion. Quite the opposite. We made it because we were moved by
the book. It became a passion for Marty. I hope other people are
moved, too.
   ``I find it ironic that the fundamentalists would object. I find
it a very tende and moving version of the Christ story.''
   She was born Barbara Herzst 40 years ago in Hollywood. Her
family nicknamed her Sarah, after the great actress Sarah
Bernhardt, because she was always acting. She spent hours before a
mirror, practicing expressions of Annette, Darlene and other
members of ``The Mickey Mouse Club.''
   Even before graduation from Hollywood High she was appearing in
such TV series as ``Gidget,'' ``The Monroes'' and ``The Farmer's
Daughter.'' At 20 she played a liberated young woman in ``Last
Summer,'' and she continued the role in her life with Carradine.
   It has taken a long time to shake that 1970s image, but now's
managed and has caught the industy's eye.

<HEAD>The Artists: Soviet Non-Conformist Art Makes Its Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of 10 rooms in the cramped and dreary
communal apartment, a man escapes from his windowless existence in
a novel way _ a contraption catapults him into space, and freedom.
   The ``apartment'' is a piece of art based on the Moscow flat in
which artist Ilya Kabakov grew up, but it has no Soviet address.
   Instead, these full-scale rooms were built in an art gallery in
New York's Soho section. And to some, the fact that Kabakov's art
reached America at all is every bit as remarkable as the device
that propelled his character, ``The Man Who Flew Into Space.''
   ``Under `glasnost,' all of a sudden, you can buy this work out
of the Soviet Union,'' said Ronald Feldman, whose gallery _ after a
decade of trying _ recently exhibited the Kabakov installation,
entitled ``Ten Characters.''
   ``I think that this change cannot be underestimated. They (the
Soviet government) do it for several reasons. They do it to earn
hard currency. But at the same time they obviously are learning not
to be afraid of their own intelligentsia, of their own creative
people.''
   In the United States, where interest in things Soviet is
growing, art dealers are leaping at the chance to show and market
Soviet art rarely seen outside the artists' studios, let alone
outside their country.
   Under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union is
no longer making a clear distinction between ``official'' artists
who bow to socialist realism's glorification of state and worker,
and ``unofficial'' artists, such as Kabakov, who don't.
   Until recently, Western art dealers had to rely on smuggling and
gifts to bring non-conformist art from the Soviet Union to their
galleries, said Todd Bludeau, of SOVART, a private firm that
promotes Soviet artists in the United States. Now dealers negotiate
directly with Soviet officials to launch exhibits.
   In putting together the Kabakov exhibition, Feldman said he
dealt with the Soviet Ministries of Trade and Culture. The price of
each work of art to be sold in the West is negotiated with the
government.
   If a painting sells for $10,000, about $4,000 goes to the
gallery and $6,000 to the artist, of which the government takes
$3,000, Feldman explained. But before the state remits an artist's
$3,000 share, the money is changed into rubles at the low, official
rate.
   A few blocks north of Feldman's gallery, the Eduard Nakhamkin
Gallery has exhibited the works of Soviet artists Vladimir
Yankilevsky and Viatcheslav Kalinin. The Phyllis Kind Gallery plans
a Soviet exhibition this fall.
   Kabakov's work ranges from $50,000 to $100,000 for one of his
rooms. Most of Kalinin's paintings have sold for at least $30,000.
Yankilevsky's work ranges from $2,000 for an etching to about
$80,000 for a painting.
   Although Soviet non-conformist art is being actively sought by
dealers, collectors and museums in the West, it is still gathering
dust in the Soviet Union. Artists such as Kabakov _ who supports
himself as an illustrator in Moscow _ have few opportunities to
exhibit and sell their work there.
   ``The Russian Ministry of Culture doesn't mind for them to be
exhibited outside and be successful _ but still very cautious
inside Russia,'' said Nakhamkin, a Soviet emigre who came to the
United States 13 years ago and now owns five galleries in New York
and California.
   Even inside the Soviet Union, however, change is in the offing.
   Kabakov and Yankilevsky were among the contemporary Soviet
artists whose work was recently sold by Sotheby's at the first
international art auction in Moscow since 1917. Foreigners spent
more than $3 million at the sale.
   In addition to 100 works by 29 living artists, 18 paintings by
five artists from the Russian avant-garde period of 1910-40 were on
the block. Alexander Rodchenko's 1920 painting, ``Line,'' topped
the bidding at $567,000; Grisha Bruskin's 1986 work, ``Fundamental
Lexicon,'' was sold for $416,000.
   Works of the Russian avant-garde also will be featured at an
exhibition at the Russian Museum in Leningrad in the fall. Much of
the art has been kept from public view since 1932 when Soviet
officials decreed it was alien to the nation's cultural goals.
   In the spirit of ``glasnost,'' a catalog of the exhibition,
entitled ``Soviet Art 1920-1930, From the Russian Museum,
Leningrad,'' is being co-published by Harry N. Abrams Inc., and
Sovietsky Khudozhnik, the Soviet publishing house for artists.
Included in the exhibition and book are the works of Kasimir
Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, Alexander Rodchenko, Pavel Filonov and
Vladimir Tatlin.
   Loneliness and alienation are common themes in the art emerging
from the Soviet Union. ``Ten Characters'' is about ``little men,''
and the contrast between their ``boring and cold outer world'' and
their ``very intensive, very colorful inner life,'' said Kabakov,
54, through his friend and interpreter, Gregory Perkel, an artist
who emigrated from Moscow 10 years ago.
   Each of the 10 rooms of the communal apartment is home to a
different fictive character. The room occupied by ``The Man Who
Never Threw Anything Away'' is filled with carefully cataloged bits
of trash.
   There's also the collector's room, where the walls are decorated
with an array of colorful postcards, and the short man's room which
has a labyrinth of knee-high drawings across the floor.
   Through his characters' quirky passions _ documented by the
objects in their rooms and a text which accompanies the
installation _ the artist reveals humor, passion and color, even
beauty.
   Kabakov insists that the installation is not about life in the
Soviet Union but is a metaphor for human experience in general.
``Differences between the outer world and inner world exist in all
social systems,'' he said.
   However, when Perkel first saw the room with the catapult, he
thought, ```I can't stay there, in that room, particularly in that
country. I have to get out of that room.' So that's the reason I'm
here. I emigrated 10 years ago. ... I just catapulted myself to the
United States.''
   At the other end of the Soviet art spectrum is Kalinin, 50, who
considers himself a follower of the realist painting of the Moscow
School.
   He distorts the natural into absurdity and caricature, and dubs
it ``fantastic realism.'' An unsympathetic feeling pervades his
work, which features alcohol, guns, card-playing, wrinkled faces
and abandoned buildings.
   ``Official people don't like my art because I show the
unpleasant side of life in Russia,'' he said, as Nakhamkin
interpreted for him. But he added that he did not believe his work
was negative.
   The Western romance with Soviet art is in full swing, Feldman
said, but its duration is unknown. But, he noted, ``The only thing
that will last is good art.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Movies Light Up Loggins' Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Give Kenny Loggins a movie and he'll give you a
hit tune.
   Since splitting with partner Jim Messina in 1976 so both could
pursue solo careers, Loggins has found success in songs for movies.
   He's touted by Columbia Records publicity as ``the only male
solo artist to have achieved three Top 10 singles from three
different films.''
   The songs are ``I'm Alright'' from ``Caddyshack'' in 1980; the
title song of ``Footloose'' in 1984; and ``Danger Zone'' from ``Top
Gun'' in 1986.
   His new single, ``Nobody's Fool,'' from ``Caddyshack II,'' is in
the Top 40 and heading toward becoming his fourth Top 10 from a
film. Loggins' new album, ``Back to Avalon'' is his first in three
years.
   Loggins talked about his new album and career in an interview
before beginning an American tour which will keep him on the road
through Oct. 9.
   Here are highlights of that interview.
   Q. Why is ``Back to Avalon'' your first solo album in three
years?
   A. I was asking myself that the other day. I guess time just
sort of swept by. I wrote and recorded more songs for this album
than the 10 or 11 I normally do. I recorded 16 or 17.
   I had a third child, a little girl, 8 months old, whose brothers
are 7 and 6. We've been building a home in Santa Barbara (Calif.).
For those who've built homes, they know that can be consuming.
   And during that period I had two soundtrack songs, ``Meet Me
Half Way'' in ``Over the Top'' and ``Danger Zone'' in ``Top Gun.''
   Q. Is ``Back to Avalon'' about Catalina Island?
   A. No. Avalon's a mythical place which has to do with King
Arthur's Court. The song isn't about King Arthur's Court. It's
about a relationship that has been together awhile and started to
drift apart. The singer refers to the way love used to be as
Avalon. They've got one last try to regain that feel of Avalon.
   Q. Do they?
   A. I have no idea. It's as if it was a scene of a movie. You
only get to see the one scene; you don't get to see the resolution.
   Quite often I get a visual idea and what I try to do is describe
the scene and the emotion behind the scene, which is probably why I
enjoy doing the soundtrack thing so much. They deliver up a scene
for me and I try to find the emotion behind the scene and write the
song to it.
   Q. Have you always written that way?
   A. Yes. There's always a moment in time that you freeze and you
try to describe best that single emotion in that single moment.
   Q. What has been your most successful ``emotion behind a scene''
song?
   A. Possibly ``Forever,'' a hit of mine a couple of years ago. Or
``Back to Avalon.'' I like to think my writing gets better as I get
older.
   Q. Are there disadvantages to being identified with movie songs?
   A. I don't think there is any stigma to singing movie songs. The
only thing I would worry about would be that radio would say,
``We're not going to play this any more.'' So far they're behind
me. That's all that matters. I figure as long as it's a good song
they'll play it.
   I don't think I've compromised my writing to do it. I've been
very fortunate that I've had such luck with it.
   Q. Can a hit song only come from a hit movie?
   A. I had a hit record, ``Meet Me Half Way,'' from a dog movie,
Sly Stallone's ``Over the Top.''
   Q. Have you had any movie songs that didn't work out?
   A. I told the two guys doing ``Flashdance'' that I didn't have
time to write and record for it; I was on the road. Within a few
days of being on the road I fell off a stage in Utah and broke a
couple of ribs. I was sent home. During the recuperation, I tried
to put together a song for ``Flashdance.'' They liked it. I felt it
wasn't good enough and I pulled it, not realizing the movie was
going to be one of the biggest summer movies in history.
   Q. Does your success with movie songs bring you lots of offers?
   A. I expected, once you had a few hits, they'd come looking for
you. But for the most part you have to search them out. When I hear
about a project that has got a buzz on it, I'll have my manager
make some calls and see if they're interested in music and if I can
get in to see a screening.
   Q. How did you start with movie songs?
   A. I wrote ``I Believe in Love,'' which Barbra Streisand sang in
``A Star Is Born,'' and met Jon Peters (Streisand's former
companion), who was producing. Jon called me for ``Caddyshack.''
They needed a theme song. I watched a rough cut, laughed a lot and
wanted to be a part of it. Within a couple of days I'd written
``I'm Alright.''
   But I wasn't so sure when he called about ``Caddyshack II.'' I
was a little skittish about trusting lightning to strike twice in
the same place.
   Q. Have you written all the movie songs you've recorded?
   A. ``Danger Zone'' and ``Meet Me Half Way'' were both written by
Georgio Moroder. The ``Footloose'' script was written by a friend
of mine, lyricist Dean Pitchford. We wrote ``Footloose'' and ``I'm
Free'' together, which were in the movie. He went on to collaborate
on all the songs in the movie.
   Q. What were your thoughts when you turned 40 this year?
   A. You mean about suicide? I was a little depressed for a few
days. When you're in rock 'n' roll you don't expect to turn 40.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: An Endless Number of Possibilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are no sure things in Bobbie Ann Mason's
stories, just endless possibilities.
   ``I think in terms of possibility. It's part of my heritage,''
said Mason, whose second novel is called ``Spence + Lila'' (Harper
and Row, $12.95).
   Spence and Lila Culpepper are a couple in their 60s who live on
a farm in western Kentucky. They are brought together with their
three children, Nancy, Catherine and Lee, when Lila is diagnosed as
having breast cancer and must undergo surgery.
   Mason, a native of western Kentucky, contrasts the lives of
Spence and Lila, who have spent most of their lives on the farm, to
those of the children, who have moved away.
   ``It's a very confusing time for people of that (the children's)
generation,'' the author said. ``They're subject to so many
influences and problems because of all the choices. They can get
divorced; their parents couldn't do that. So many influences, so
much more money.''
   While the children move around the country trying to find
themselves, Spence is perfectly happy to stay on the farm.
   ``There's a passage where Spence is looking around the farm and
thinking that everyone is breaking their necks trying to get
something grand,'' Mason said. ``For Spence, it's right here, on
the farm. The basic facts of the universe are here: birth, growth
and death.
   ``It is extraordinary to plant soy beans and harvest them.''
   Mason, born in 1940, can relate well to the Culpepper children.
She grew up on a dairy farm near Mayfield, Ky., and was the first
member of her family to go college, taking journalism classes at
the University of Kentucky.
   She has also done her share of moving. After college, she lived
in New York and went to graduate school at the State University in
Binghamton, N.Y., and the Uny
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ty of Connecticut. She now lives
with her husband in rural Pennsylvania.
   Mason's independence and thirst for adventure was inspired by
the movies her parents took her to see as a child.
   ``They saw movies, but they didn't have the sense that they
could just take off and go to California and go where the movies
are,'' she said. ``It seemed possible for me to go out there.''
   The radio also had an impact on the author.
   ``I first listened to rhythm and blues in the late '40s and
early '50s,'' Mason recalled. ``That struck a very deep chord in me
_ one of those formative things. I certainly had the longing and
curiosity and wanting to experience new things.
   ``That's why I have Spence as a rock 'n' roll fan.''
   Mason's first story was published in 1980. Two years later, she
released ``Shiloh,'' a collection of short stories that won the
PEN-Ernest Hemingway Award for first fiction.
   In 1985, she came out with her first novel, ``In Country'', the
story of Sam Hughes, a teen-ager trying to learn more about her
late father, a Vietnam soldier killed before she was born.
   ``In Country,'' was a best seller. A film adaptation, starring
the English actress Emily Lloyd as Sam and Bruce Willis as her
uncle, is in progess.
   Mason writes sparely, leaving much of the interpretation to the
reader. She has been compared to such contemporary writers as Ann
Beattie and Raymond Carver, who have been called minimalists.
   While Mason admires Carver and Beattie, she rejects the idea of
consciously emulating them.
   ``One doesn't like to identify with labels. That means that you
agree that you're part of a movement,'' she said. ``That's just me.
I think in a certain decade; lots of people are going to sound
similar.''
   Describing Lila's thoughts the night before her operation, Mason
uses short, almost telegraphic sentences:
   ``Lila can't sleep. Random scenes pass before her eyes. The
strong, comfortable smells of cows in the barn waiting to be
milked, the steamy air in winter. Gathering in tomatoes before a
frost. Sprinkling lime on the potatoes spread out on the ground in
a stall of the barn. Laying the onions on screen-door racks above.''
   Mason notes that the real meaning of her stories can be learned
from the pacing of her writing, rather than the words themselves.
   ``Hardly anybody points out those things. The sentence rhythms
mean everything because they create the tone and the voice and the
characters.''
   For ``Spence + Lila,'' Mason sought to create a delicate mood.
   ``I wanted it be very calm and reflective and tender and deep.
To go way inside. It's a love story.'' That's why she put a plus
symbol in the title.
   After Lila's surgery, she and Spence return to the farm. The
books ends with this passage in the garden of Spence observing Lila:
   ``The way she laughs is the moment he has been waiting for. She
rears her head back and laughs steadily, her throat working and her
eyes flashing. Her throat catches her finally and slows her down,
but her face dances like pond water in the rain, all unsettled and
stirring with aroused possibility.''
   ``Somebody said to me that the word `possibility' is the key,''
Mason said of the ending. ``Possibility is what there is.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Vanwarmer Album `Like Gathering Your Family'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-songwriter Randy Vanwarmer is
counting on the emotional edge of his new album to stem a nine-year
slide since his million-selling hit ``Just When I Needed You Most.''
   The 33-year-old Vanwarmer has just released ``I Am,'' a
collection of soft country ballads with romantic titles such as ``I
Will Hold You,''``That's What Your Smile Does for Me'' and ``Words
I Never Meant.'' It's his first album in four years.
   ``There's something spiritual about the record,'' Vanwarmer said
in an interview. ``It's kind of like gathering your family around
the fireplace.''
   As a marketing exercise, however, it has been a disaster.
   Instead of Vanwarmer's ``It's a Heartache,'' a tune by pop-jazz
singer Michael Franks, ``The Camera Never Lies,'' was distributed
erroneously with Vanwarmer's name printed on it.
   The mistake was repeated during a second round of distribution,
so record company officials gave up on the song and will switch to
another one, ``Where the Rocky Mountains Touch the Morning Sun.''
   ``The radio stations kept calling and saying, `We like Randy's
record but he's not country enough for our station,''' Vanwarmer
said.
   ``His record is kind of jazz, funky, but we have similar
textured voices. I can almost understand why they almost thought it
was me.''
   His tough luck continues a pattern since his powerful ``Just
When I Needed You Most'' propelled him from obscurity in 1979.
   Instead of establishing himself as a ballad singer, he followed
up with an uptempo tune titled ``Gotta Get Out of Here.''
   ``It did terribly,'' Vanwarmer recalled.
   More than half a dozen singles were released subsequently, but
none was a hit. On the advice of others, he declined to do American
concert tours that would have built up his name and following. A
possible tour with Anne Murray was bypassed.
   Furthermore, his record company wound down, ``and I don't think
they were putting the money behind the records that they needed
to,'' he said.
   ``I don't blame anybody,'' he said about the downfall. ``Maybe
if I had been more knowledgeable. ...
   ``We had one solid record, and then we wanted to change
direction _ something with a little more edge. I wanted to do it;
that was just naivete. My first record seemed so easy. I do ballads
best. We could have done another ballad, but we put out an uptempo
thing.''
   Though he failed to capitalize on the success of ``Just When I
Needed You Most,'' he says his royalties from writing the hit paid
the bills for six years.
   His breakup with his girlfriend inspired the song.
   ``That was kind of devastating,'' he recalled. Six months later,
he sat down and put the song on paper.
   ``I found that those kind of songs, the deepest ones, come some
time after an event. You're too traumatized at the time. When
someone leaves, you just don't go sit down and write a song. If you
did, you'd almost wish bad things would happen to you.''
   He said the song was a hit because listeners related to a lament
over a broken romance. ``It's happened to everyone. That emotion is
universal. Some people like to feel sorry for themselves,'' he said.
   ``I always hoped the record wasn't wallowing in self pity and it
had some redeeming value, and I guess it does.''
   A footnote about the song is that John Sebastian of the rock
group Lovin' Spoonful played autoharp on the record.
   ``To me, it was one of the things that sold the record,''
Vanwarmer said.
   In 1980, he wrote the song ``It Never Hurts to Hurt Sometimes,''
which later became a No. 1 hit for the Oak Ridge Boys.
   The song, triggered by the death of his father 13 years earlier,
made its way to the charts in an unusual fashion. The song got into
the hands of Oak Ridge Boys' record producer Ron Chancey, whose
wife fell in love with it after hearing it on a demonstration tape.
It was then recorded by the group as a favor to her, Vanwarmer said.
   ``One perk of being a songwriter is exorcising your feelings as
they come along,'' he said. ``And people can exorcise theirs as
they listen too.''
   He wrote it on Christmas Eve as he sat alone at home before
gathering with family members.
   ``It was emotion from the heart. It wrote itself.''

<HEAD>Superconductivity Race Continues At Frantic Pace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first word came in a Japanese financial
newspaper in January: Hiroshi Maeda of the University of Tokyo had
found a superconductor that broke all previous temperature records.
   While legions of physicists struggled to decipher the Japanese
and to duplicate Maeda's feat, two newcomers at the University of
Arkansas announced they had smashed his record.
   A few days later, IBM scientists fiddling with the Arkansas
superconductor in San Jose, Calif., hit a high-temperature mark
that still stands.
   All the pandemonium began with the January 1986 discovery by two
IBM scientists in Zurich, Switzerland, that a complicated mixture
of lanthanum, barium, copper and oxygen could carry electricity
with no resistance at 396 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   In the exotic landscape of physics, that was terribly warm.
Before the ``Zurich oxide,'' as it's sometimes called,
superconductors worked only at temperatures colder than minus 418
degrees, about 42 degrees above absolute zero.
   The IBM discovery impressed the Stockholm crowd. The scientists,
K. Alex Mueller and J. Georg Bednorz, received the 1987 Nobel Prize
_ one of the fastest on record.
   Superconductivity almost seems to violate nature's laws. When
electricity passes through ordinary conductors, some is inevitably
converted into heat. Sometimes a lot of it _ as in your toaster.
   But not in superconductors. They carry electricity with no
resistance _ and no heat loss. None.
   That's more than a scientist's idea of a parlor trick. These
brittle ceramic metals could lead to zero-resistance electric power
lines, exotic energy storage devices and other wonders. And no
story on superconductivity would be complete without a mention of
super-fast trains magnetically levitated over superconducting rails.
   The truth is, no one is quite sure where and when
superconductors will turn up outside physics labs. Economists may
be better forecasters than physicists.
   Mag-lev trains might work in lab tests, but who will pay to
build them? Are utilities going to rip out serviceable power lines
to put up superconductors? Not if they have to double or triple
your electric bill to pay for it.
   President Reagan told a conference last year, ``There are
predictions of high-speed trains levitated above their tracks,
supercomputers on a single silicon chip, cheaper and more effective
medical imaging devices.''
   Reagan said it's ``our business to discover ways to turn our
dreams into history as soon as possible,'' but he won't foot the
bill, either. The National Science Foundation budget for
condensed-matter physics, which includes superconductivity, is
$37.2 million this year, up just 0.5 percent.
   Such worldly concerns aside, physicists are silly with
excitement.
   ``Somebody described scientists like pigeons,'' said Brian
Schwartz, a physicist at Brooklyn College of the City University of
New York. ``You throw bread here and everybody pecks here. Then you
throw bread over there and everybody pecks there.''
   The record holders are the IBM researchers, led by Paul Grant,
who pushed the threshhold to 234 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   Grant and company surpassed the report by Maeda of
superconductivity onset at minus 243 degrees. Maeda started with
copper oxide _ or copper and oxygen, the common denominators in
nearly all the new superconductors _ and added bismuth, strontium
and calcium.
   Earlier compounds had contained yttrium instead of bismuth.
Physicists soon were wearing buttons that read ``Sell yttrium _ buy
bismuth.''
   ``The last 18 months have been the most exciting in my life,''
Grant said at the March meeting of the American Physical Society in
New Orleans a year after the so-called ``Woodstock of physics'' in
New York.
   That was when most physicists got their first reports on the new
superconductors. ``That was a once-in-a-lifetime event. It was
incredible. Incredible. What else can I say?'' said Grant, echoing
others who were there.
   A ``Woodstock II'' session was held this year, with late reports
on the superconductors discovered in Tokyo and Arkansas.
   One of the stars was Arkansas' Allen Hermann. He and Zhengzhi
Sheng discovered the thallium-barium-copper-oxygen superconductor
(to which they later added calcium) that holds the high temperature
record set by Grant.
   Hermann and Sheng reported superconductivity at minus 238
degrees, earning them a momentary record until Grant pushed their
compound further. They since have matched his mark.
   How high the temperature record will go is anybody's guess.
Scattered reports of superconductivity at room temperature haven't
been confirmed, but many researchers believe room-temperature
superconductivity may be possible.
   Not all the action is in the glamorous search for new
superconductors and the race for higher temperatures, however.
Theorists _ the armchair physicists whose job is to think, not to
concoct _ think they are beginning to understand how the new
superconductors work.
   The key seems to be the arrangement of the copper oxide.
Electron microscopes have shown that the copper and oxygen atoms
arrange themselves in planes. The other elements serve as spacers,
sandwiched between the planes.
   In some compounds, each plane is separated from its neighbors.
In others the planes are paired, and in the newest the planes occur
in threes.
   The more planes, the higher the temperature at which
superconductivity occurs. At the moment, that's a mere observation.
   ``If we can go to four layers, we should be able to go to higher
transition temperatures,'' said Robert Hazen of the Geophysical
Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C.
   The next question to be addressed is why it should be so, but
physicists at last have a direction to go that's more than hunch,
which is how they got where they are. Anyone can do it: Melt a few
elements together, let the stew harden, cool it to frigid
temperatures and see what happens.
   Hazen calls that ``shake and bake'' science, or ``cook and
look.''
   Of course, not everything is as simple as stacking planes. Just
when physicists had become comfortable thinking about planes, a
superconductor with no stacked planes was discovered. The mixture
of potassium, barium, bismuth and oxygen became superconducting at
about 406 degrees below zero, according to its discoverers at
AT&T's Bell Laboratories.
   It's not a contender in the high-temperature race. But Paul
Fleury, one of the discoverers, said, ``There's a whole new
ballfield that's opened up now.''
   On another ballfield, Stuart Wolf of the Naval Research
Laboratory in Washington, D.C., has produced a
lanthanum-copper-oxygen superconductor with a simpler structure,
but similar to the other copper-containing superconductors.
   It's a kind of superconductor building block, and Wolf believes
it's a contender. He thinks it could go superconducting at higher
temperatures than Hermann's thallium mix, and he's out to prove it.
   His first tests show superconductivity at minus 280 degrees
Fahrenheit, but he's betting he can reach a toasty 100 degrees
below zero.
   There is a catch. Wolf's simple superconductor isn't simple to
make. It must be cooked at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit and squeezed at
65,000 times normal atmospheric pressure. Fortunately for Wolf,
once the material is made it can be cooled and studied at normal
temperatures and pressures.
   ``Nature's been kind _ it's done something we never expected,''
said Schwartz. ``We never thought we'd be operating at these
temperatures in our lifetime _ or ever.''

<DATELINE>VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Pressinger's troubles began when
he was teaching in a portable classroom built with particle board.
   His chest hurt, he couldn't concentrate and he was depressed. He
had frequent colds and an abnormally low white-blood cell count,
indicating liver malfunction. Doctors couldn't determine a cause
for his symptoms.
   Pressinger's suffering became so intense he finally left his
girlfriend and gave up his job. He joined the Peace Corps and went
to teach in Jamaica, but had to leave after a year because the
Ministry of Education began using a strong pesticide in the
classrooms in which he taught.
   Suspecting sensitivity to chemicals, he began sleeping on a
beach to escape the smells of pesticides, disinfectants, paint, and
even perfume.
   Pressinger, 33, is one of a growing number of people who believe
they are severely allergic to chemicals, victims of environmental
illness.
   Doctors, however, can't agree on what is causing symptoms that
have led some sufferers to seek a ``toxic free environment'' by
giving up their jobs and moving to the desert or even going so far
as to seal their rooms with aluminum foil linings.
   ``Much of what is attributed to environmental factors can only
be theorized,'' says Dr. Phillip Lieberman, a Memphis, Tenn.,
clinical allergist and president of the American Academy of Allergy
and Immunology. ``So there is great controversy as to whether the
precepts of the physicians practicing environmental medicine are
valid, at this time.''
   The burden of proof ``belongs on the physicians practicing the
specialty,'' Lieberman says.
   Dr. William Rae, a cardiovascular surgeon who also specializes
in clinical ecology, says, ``Nothing is 100 percent proven. But
most of the debate occurs out of ignorance... It's a scapegoat for
not looking into it critically.''
   Rae contends that 10 percent to 20 percent of the population
suffers from such sensitivity. His clinic in Dallas says it has
treated 17,000 people for environmental illness in the past dozen
years.
   Some of them are sensitive to formaldehyde in particle board,
paneling and rugs, others to food or gasoline. Even the smell of
deodorant, vehicle exhaust, newsprint, clothes, bedding and other
everyday substances can cause reactions.
   Pressinger lives at his mother's home here, doing everything he
can to avoid contact with chemicals. He believes his only real
escape is a secluded, uninhabited island. He has checked out
properties in Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee, and now is
trying to get enough sufferers together to buy an island in the
Bahamas which is untainted by pollution.
   The island he's found is 2{ miles long and a half-mile wide
about 5 miles from Abaco Island. Its asking price is $4 million and
Pressinger says it could be subdivided for sale just to sufferers
of chemically caused illnesses.
   ``This type of arrangement would allow complete control of the
surroundings without the risk of unexpected chemical exposures.
We've got to find someplace. It's not a matter of if, but when.''
   Fred Nelson, who heads the National Foundation for the
Chemically Hypersensitive, in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., says the
group is interested in a chemical-free environment. ``We feel the
need is for an inexpensive, long-term rehabilitation oasis for the
environmentally ill and their families.''
   Pressinger also has taken his idea to the Chicago-based Human
Ecology Action League, which publishes a magazine, runs educational
campaigns about the problem and helps sufferers find treatment. Rae
is one of its directors.
   ``In the beginning, I thought I was the only one that had such
problems,'' says Pressinger. ``The initial reaction of doctors is
that it's a psychological problem. It's a complex illness that is
little understood, even by physicians.
   ``There are many people out there who have it and don't even
know it.''

<HEAD>Researcher Says Prairie Dogs A Problem But Misunderstood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TENA HARALDSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ranchers say prairie dogs don't live up
to that cute-sounding name. Prairie rodents is more like it, they
grumble of the furry animals that chomp grass and booby-trap
pastures with their burrows.
   Zoologist John Hoogland admits the critters cause problems but
says they're basically misunderstood. Much of what he says flies in
the face of lore.
   ``Prairie dogs will expand unless they are controlled, said
Verne Brakke, director of regulatory services for the state
Agriculture Department.
   Not so, said Hoogland. In fact, in a behavior pattern observed
in fewer than a dozen other species, prairie dog mothers leave
their own pups unguarded to enter the burrows of female relatives
where they kill and eat the babies.
   ``The implications of this are enormous,'' he said. ``There
seems to be a system in which the prairie dogs are controlling
themselves.''
   Hoogland, of the University of Maryland, has been watching
prairie dogs in one colony in Wind Cave National Park since 1975,
and the population has stayed around 150. ``That colony has not
expanded 1 inch,'' he said.
   The killings at first went unnoticed because they occurred in
burrows, then Hoogland noticed that females visiting other burrows
would emerge with blood on their fur. The evidence was uncovered
when a burrow was excavated.
   ``Fifty-one percent of all litters are killed by infanticide,''
he said, adding that the common perpetrator is a female relative,
though in a few cases the mother turns on her own litter. Litters
average two to three pups.
   ``The leading candidate is that they are doing it for food,'' he
said. ``I have never seen them eat any other meat.
   ``Maybe in other colonies there are certain things we could do
to make the prairie dogs control themselves.''
   Ranchers won't shed tears over the deaths of prairie dog pups.
Since the 1800s, when pioneers and their cattle moved west, it's
been war.
   ``Back in the early 1900s at one point the U.S. government hired
125,000 people whose only job was to eradicate prairie dogs,''
Hoogland said.
   Those efforts continue today in states like South Dakota,
Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska and Colorado, said Brakke. Most states
have animal damage offices, but anti-prairie dog efforts are not
coordinated from state to state.
   South Dakota had 800,000 acres of prairie dog towns in 1980.
Today that is down to 250,000 to 300,000, Brakke said. No figures
are available on the amount of land infested nationwide, but
millions of acres are involved, he said.
   ``They are a rodent. We give them kind of a cute and furry
little attribute, so we call them prairie dogs. If we called them
prairie rats or prairie rodents there wouldn't be that
connotation,'' he said.
   ``I grew up with a dislike, a distaste and an aboslute hate for
prairie dogs,'' said state Agriculture Secretary Marvis Hogen.
``The bread of life in South Dakota is grass, and those little
buggers eat grass, and the second thing is they make holes that
your horse can step in and break his leg.''
   Hoogland said it's hard to find examples of that, and added,
``Everybody hates prairie dogs but almost nothing was known about
them. Ranchers say, `Look what they've done to my land,' but
there's a lot of evidence that prairie dogs move into areas that
have already been overgrazed.
   ``I'm not saying there's no competition (with livestock) but I'm
saying all the evidence isn't in yet. Two hundred years ago there
were jillions of prairie dogs and jillions of buffalo, so they
could coexist.''

<HEAD>Researchers Seek Biodegradable Plastic Nets, Lobster Traps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget about mice. Researchers here are
working on a better lobster trap _ one that lets the lobsters
escape.
   Prompted by what they say are the needless deaths of 200,000
lobsters a year when wooden traps break free of buoys and the
lobsters starve, chemists at Stevens Institute of Technology are
trying out biodegradable plastic.
   They have buried 16 plastic compounds in the seabed along the
Atlantic coast, and will study the compounds this month, says Ken
Gonsolves, a chemical engineer at Stevens' Polymer Processing
Institute.
   The aim is to replace one or two of the slats in traditional
traps with plastic that would deteriorate within a few months,
letting lobsters break out, Gonsolves said. Wood traps take a year
or more to deteriorate underwater.
   Stevens is working with the New Jersey Maritime Sciences
Consortium, an alliance of Mid-Atlantic and New England colleges,
under a $187,000 grant from the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   Shrinking harvests could make lobstermen change to the escapable
traps as a way to save future stocks, says William Gordon of the
maritime consortium.
   Gonsolves suggested that the technology could also be applied to
fishing and trawling nets, ``which continue to trap fish and sea
mammals after they are lost at sea.''

<HEAD>Florida To Have Universe's Coldest Spot In New Physics Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicists who want to study the
rotation of atoms hope to make them stand still by turning a lab in
the Sunshine State into the coldest spot in the universe.
   The University of Florida's Microkelvin Research Lab will open
in the early fall, and physicist Gary Ihas said, ``It is designed
to take matter closer to absolute zero than it has ever been
before. We'll be able to get to within one-millionth of a degree of
absolute zero _ to one microkelvin.''
   Absolute zero, the theoretical point at which even the atoms in
matter stop moving around, is minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, or
zero on the Kelvin scale.
   ``The coldest temperature in the universe, in the empty space
betweeen galaxies, is about 3 degrees Kelvin, so this will be
roughly 3 million times colder than that,'' Ihas said.
   ``At extremely low temperatures, atoms slow to such an extent
that you can look at very small interactions, you can study the
motion between the particles themselves,'' Ihas said. ``Looking at
things in that way allows you to understand the laws of physics in
basic, deeper ways.''
   The lab, supported by a $1.3 million National Science Foundation
grant and private funds, consists of three 41-foot-deep pits to
house cryostats, shielded refrigeration units. Footsteps can raise
temperatures 500 microkelvin, so huge shock absorbers will isolate
the cryostats and an electromagnetic shield will deflect radio
waves and other electrical disturbances.
   The lab's chief purpose is research, but Ihas said, ``There are
always spinoffs that are unpredictable... not because we understand
the new physics and apply it, but because we stumble on to
something, because of serendipity.''
   One problem, he said, will be that ``since no one has really
been this cold, we don't know what kind of thermometer is going to
work.''

<HEAD>Task Force Finds Slight Increase In Grizzly Bear Population</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen years after the
grizzly bear was declared to be a threatened species, its
population in the Yellowstone area now is growing, according to a
task force of scientists.
   The scientists said they can't pinpoint the number of grizzlies
because the ecosystem comprises 9,600 very rugged square miles but,
there were at least 45 adult females in 1985, up from 32 in 1983.
They figure 170 to 180 bears lived in the area and the population
is growing 0.07 percent to 1.5 percent a year.
   ``This increase is partially a result of grizzly bear management
programs,'' said the task force appointed by the Interagency
Grizzly Bear Committee. It cited the increase as cause for cautious
optimism, noting ``The recovery and survival of the grizzly bear in
the Yellowstone ecosystem will require continued careful
management.''
   The grizzly bear has been protected since 1975 under the federal
Endangered Species Act.

industrial companies, said its index of economic growth dipped to
59 percent in July from 59.3 percent in June.
   A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is expanding,

acquisition in General Cinema raises questions about Securities and
Exchange Commission guidelines.
   General Cinema received a brown manila envelope with no return

<HEAD>Pullman Accepts $650 Million Buyout By Forstmann Little</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment firm Forstmann Little & Co. is
taking Pullman Co. private in a buyout it values at about $650
million, having convinced the company to drop a management-led
buyout plan.
   Forstmann Little, which specializes in leveraged buyouts,
announced Sunday Pullman had agreed to a buyout at $9.25 cash per
share for its 41.9 million outstanding shares, or about $387.57
million.
   Assumption of existing debt and expenses will make the total
price of the buyout about $650 million, Forstmann Little stated.
   The buyout was conditioned on Pullman terminating its earlier
agreement for a $7.75 per share buyout by a group led by Thomas M.
Begel, the company's chairman and chief executive, and Henley
Manufacturing Corp., Pullman's biggest shareholder with 9 percent
of the company's outstanding shares.
   Pullman stock closed unchanged at $9 a share Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   ``I am pleased that Pullman's stockholders will get the benefit
of the $9.25 transaction price and am confident that by being one
of the Forstmann Little group of companies, new opportunities will
be provided for Pullman's employees,'' Begel said in a news release.
   Pullman, based in Princeton, N.J., is a diversified manufacturer
of industrial and engineered component products, including truck
trailers, aircraft seating, food service equipment, weapons systems
components, refuse disposal equipment and fluid handling systems.
   ``The acquisition of Pullman is an opportunity for Forstmann
Little to purchase a well-managed diverse group of industrial
businesses, which have strong niche market positions,'' said
Nicholas C. Forstmann, a general partner of Forstmann Little.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid with money raised by the target
company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.
   The Begel group had planned to sell a number of Pullman's
businesses and divisions to pay off debt incurred in its buyout.

   Stock prices surged higher in moderate trading
today, while the dollar held its ground against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 288.31-point
winner during Saturday's half-day session, added 126.37 points, or
0.45 percent, for 28,326.31 points, its second-highest finish ever.
   ``Up till now, gains were retricted to one area, specifically
steel issues, but activity has now expanded to include high-tech
and real estate issues,'' said a dealer at a major securities firm.
   The gains are likely to continue, he added, speaking
anonymously. It was the sixth consecutive gain for the index, which
broke the 28,000-point level Saturday for the first time since
mid-July.
   Shortly after the start of the week's trading, the Nikkei
briefly touched 28,409.17 points, higher than its previous record
reached June 17 when it finished at 28,342.46.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar opened at 133.23 yen
and inched up before closing at 133.25 yen.
   The currency traded in a tight but stable range of 133.09-133.42
yen during the day because of ``a lack of any market-affecting
news,'' said another dealer at a major Japanese securities firm,
who also demanded anonymity.

<HEAD>Georgia Tech Computer Models Say Wall Street Headed For Another
Big Tumble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market will be ready for a major fall,
similar to the one in October, if interest rates go any higher,
according to a Georgia Institute of Technology professor.
   ``It looks in a sense like '88 may be a replay of '87 as it
relates to the stock market,'' said Fred C. Allvine, a management
professor who based his forecast on computer analyses of the
economy.
   With factories operating near capacity and unemployment at a
14-year low, ``you see the possibility of inflation breaking out
all over, the genie getting out of the bottle,'' said Allvine, who
has headed Georgia Tech's stock marketing forecasting project for
nine years.
   Four of Georgia Tech's five market computer analyses ``have
reached a negative threshold which has been associated with
ultimate downturns on the market,'' Allvine said.
   ``Last year the economy was running very strong, there were
inflationary concerns and the Fed (Federal Reserve) was compelled
to hold a steady course on liquidity, which ultimately led to the
very speculative stock market,'' he said.
   ``Our numbers on our Fed models are showing that both the
short-term and long-term (interest) rates are becoming very close
to where they were a year ago at this time,'' Allvine said.
   ``The Fed is snugging up in terms of its action to see that the
economy does not run away,'' he said. ``If this does not work and
interest rates continue to rise, there could be another crumble in
the stock market.''
   Inflation has been a major concern of the Fed, which tries to
keep the economy stable by manipulating the supply of money in
circulation.
   The gloomy analysis is based on the fact short term rates are
higher, with the federal funds rate, the interest for overnight
borrowing by banks, as high as it was on Oct. 19, the day of the
crash, Allvine said.
   The fed funds rate, which stood at 7.625 percent when the market
collapsed, was quoted at just over 7.75 percent on Friday.
   ``Other interest rates are up sharply from the beginning of the
year, and some are higher than at the time of the crash,'' Allvine
said.
   In 1987, the prime rate rose from 7.75 percent in March to 9.25
percent two weeks before the market crashed. It stands now at 9.5
percent. The Fed's discount rate, the interest rate it charges
member banks for loans, was increased from 5.5 percent to 6 percent
a month before the crash and remains at that level.

<HEAD>China Enacts Law Giving More Power to Enterprises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Monday enacted a law that ends direct
state controls over enterprises and gives factory managers greater
freedom over their operations.
   The introduction of the enterprise law came with warnings that
factories will no longer be able to live off state largess and will
face bankruptcy if they fail to respond to market competition.
   The law, passed by the National People's Congress last April,
gives factory managers greater autonomy over planning and personnel
and makes them responsible for profits and losses.
   It is to be followed in November by enactment of China's first
bankruptcy law, which will set down rules for shutting down
insolvent plants.
   Legalization of the manager responsibility system, already
widely practiced in China's state-run factories, has been hailed as
a major step in the government's drive to reduce the role of
central planning and make industry more efficient by linking its
production to market-determined supply and demand factors.
   Zhang Yanning, deputy minister of the state commission for
restructuring the economy, said last week government departments
that previously exercised direct control over industries should
abide by the principle of ``the state regulates the market, which
in turn guides the enterprises.''
   Several years of experimenting with the manager responsibility
system, however, has proved the difficulty of following that
principle.
   Factory managers are still at the mercy of state allocations
departments that control disbursement of scarce and increasingly
expensive energy and raw materials. Managers told they now must
make profits are also thwarted by irrationally low state-set
purchasing prices for many of their products.
   Approximately one-fourth of China's state-run enterprises are
operating in the red, and the number is increasing with recent
sharp increases in the costs of raw materials.
   The People's Daily, the official voice of the Communist Party,
said in a front-page commentary Monday that China's 10-year-old
economic structural reforms have ``entered a critical stage.''
   Enterprises can no longer harbor the illusion that the state
will provide low-priced raw materials and subsidies to cover
losses, it said. Banks will not be a certain source of low-interest
loans.
   Factories must move aggressively to reform their management,
personnel, organization and income distribution systems because in
the future ``market competition will be relentless.''
   ``There will certainly be some enterprises that will fail in the
competition and be declared bankrupt,'' the newspaper said.
   Under the new law, enterprises will have the right to sell
products on their own after meeting obligations to the state, and
to choose their own suppliers, set product prices and negotiate and
sign contracts with foreign parties.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the mastermind of China's economic
reforms, first suggested an enterprise law in 1978, but it was not
until this year that disagreements over the relationship among the
state, the manager and workers were finally worked out.

   The stock market was mixed early today as
traders approached equities with caution following last week's
sharp gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged 46 points
on Friday, edged down 1.06 to 2,127.67 in the first half hour of
trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 469 issues up, 411
down and 546 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.05 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts were encouraged by the somewhat restrained activity.
   ``What you don't want to see is instant euphoria,'' said Larry
Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``That would be foolish and sophmoric.''
   A measured approach to the market could mean better things down
the road. ``That's the kind of action you get prior to a trend
resuming,'' Wachtel said.
   Market watchers have been reluctant to proclaim that the Dow's
summer rally was back on track despite its 68-point surge last
week, the key barometer's biggest weekly gain since April.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was up ] at 126[,
American Express was up } at 28~, Exxon was down ] at 47, and
Eastman Kodak was unchanged at 45|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.03 to 153.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 306.47, up 0.29.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 46.60 to
2,128.73.
   Gaining issues outnumbered declines by about 15 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 1,178 up, 329 down and 470 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 192.34 million shares, against 154.57 million shares in the

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States slipped this week by nine to total 894, Baker Hughes
Inc. reported Monday.
   During the previous week, the rig count had increased by four to
total 903. A year ago this week, the count totaled 973, the company
said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Colorado, New Mexico and
Wyoming saw the biggest increase with five new rigs each while
North Dakota increased by one.
   Texas saw the biggest decline with nine, followed by Kansas,
eight; Oklahoma, five; California and Michigan, three each; Ohio,
two, and Pennsylvania, one. Louisiana saw no change from last week.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago printing company said today it had
fired one employee and suspended another after investigating
allegations its workers were leaking advance copies of Business
Week in an insider-trading scandal.
   R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., which prints Business Week at two of
its plants, said a production worker at its Old Saybrook, Conn.,
plant had admitted furnishing advance copies of the magazine's
``Inside Wall Street'' column to a former broker with Merrill Lynch
& Co.'s New London, Conn., office.
   Merrill Lynch dismissed broker William Dillon on Thursday after
conducting an investigation into suspicious trading that appeared
linked to the Business Week articles.
   Donnelley said its investigation, in conjunction with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., also had led to the suspension of
an employee in its Torrance, Calif., plant.
   The printing firm did not identify either employee.
   Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the
names and addresses of all Donnelley's employees.
   Also last week, Prudential-Bache fired a broker, Advest Inc.
suspended one and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said as many as three
former brokers may have traded improperly on advance knowledge of
information contained in the influential Business Week column.
   Using such information to trade before it becomes publicly
available is considered a form of securities fraud under federal
law.

   Corn and soybean futures soared their permitted
daily limits at the opening today on the Chicago Board of Trade as
hot, dry weather returned to the drought-stricken Midwest.
   Wheat and oats also were sharply higher.
   After a two-week reprieve, the hostile weather has returned with
the soybean crop in the midst of its most critical growth stage,
analysts said.
   ``The next two to three weeks are going to make or bake the
soybean crop, and it looks like we're going to bake it,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with the investment firm Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Dry heat is expected to persist in the Midwest for most of this
week and that could mean another round of sharp price increases in
the crop futures markets, analysts said.
   Most contracts for future delivery of corn and soybeans opened
up their respective daily limits of 15 cents and 45 cents a bushel.
The August soybean contract, on which the limit has been removed
pending the contract's expiration later this month, was up more
than 70 cents in early trading.
   Also in early trading, wheat was 12 cents to 17 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.83 a bushel; corn
was 15 cents higher across the board with July at $3.05\ a bushel;
oats were 10 cents higher across the board with September at $2.81{
a bushel; soybeans were 45 cents to 71 cents higher with August at
$8.47 a bushel.
   Most cattle futures were sharply lower while pork futures were
sharply higher to limit-up in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .70 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August
at 66.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .42 cent to 1.27 cents
lower with August at 78.40 cents a pound; hogs were .73 cent to the
limit 1.50 cents higher with August at 45.05 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.85 cents to the limit 2 cents higher with
August at 32.52 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Friday while pork futures were
mostly higher.

   Joseph Horne Co. Inc. said Monday its
operations would not be affected by the collapse of an agreement
between Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. and Dillard Department Stores
Inc. to buy the department store chain.
   ``The current ownership and management of Horne's is and will
remain committed to the company's future,'' Robert A. O'Connell,
president and chief executive officer, said at a news conference.
   ``We intend to continue to operate Horne's as we have been
doing,'' he said.
   Horne officials said they were ``surprised at the abrupt
termination'' of the proposed sale of the 16-store chain to a
partnership formed by DeBartolo, of Youngstown, Ohio, and Dillard,
based in Little Rock, Ark.
   O'Connell said Horne officials learned the deal was in trouble
late Wednesday and learned it would not go through on Friday.
   On Saturday, Horne announced that DeBartolo, the largest
shopping mall developer in the country, and Dillard had withdrawn
from the deal.
   The two companies had been expected to close their purchase of
Horne's on Friday.
   O'Connell said Monday a number of Horne's employees who had been
told they would lose their jobs as a result of the sale will now be
kept on.
   Horne, whose stores are located in western Pennsylvania and
northern Ohio, employs about 3,500 people.
   Spokesmen for DeBartolo and Dillard Department Stores could not
be reached for comment.
   DeBartolo and Dillard agreed in April to buy Horne's from the
MMC Group Inc. of Pittsburgh for a price believed in excess of $200
million.
   MMC, which manages a $25 million investment fund called the
Maverick Fund I, is in the business of buying companies with money
from the fund and later selling them at a profit.
   MMC and a group of Horne's managers acquired the chain for $200
million in a December 1986 leveraged buyout after its former parent
company, Associated Dry Goods, was taken over by May Department
Stores. May is the parent company of Kaufmann's, Pittsburgh's
largest department store chain.
   After the deal with DeBartolo and Dillard was announced,
employees began receiving layoff notices in June.
   MMC officials have said Horne's is profitable, with sales of
about $270 million in 1987.

the selling pressure, analysts were encouraged by the restrained
approach to equities.
   ``What you don't want to see is instant euphoria,'' said Larry
Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``That would be foolish and sophmoric.''
   A measured approach to the market could mean better things down
the road. ``That's the kind of action you get prior to a trend
resuming,'' Wachtel said.
   One trader noted many dealers are looking for a profit-taking to
bring down stock prices on the heels of recent gains. ``Traders
came in with an elated feeling, but now it's time for digestion,''
he said

the key barometer's biggest weekly gain since April.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Gillette was down 2\ at

<HEAD>Kruses Cruising Along On Top of Classic Car Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUBURN, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When fashion designer Ralph Lauren set his
heart on a pair of racy Ferraris, he made one quick telephone call
to Indiana.
   Many of America's richest car buffs do the same.
   Displayed on the office walls of Mitchell D. Kruse, the man who
answered Lauren's phone call, are photographs of actors Ken
Kercheval and Joe Piscopo, pro football lineman Brian Bosworth,
hotelier Bill Marriott, and former senator and White House chief of
staff Howard Baker.
   In his late 20s, Kruse is president and owner of Kruse
International, one of the nation's most exotic auction houses.
Founded by his father, Dean V. Kruse, the company has come to
dominate the classic car market at a time when values have
skyrocketed.
   With the dizzying prices in the classic car arena, would-be
buyers of modest means are likely destined to remain would-be
buyers.
   ``We deal with such wealth that a guy can get excited and caught
up, and it doesn't matter that he just spent $100 for what most
other people think's worth $10,'' said Kruse.
   His figure of $100, of course, is figurative. Top models such as
Duesenbergs routinely fetch $1 million and more. The record belongs
to a 1931 Bugatti Royale Merline, which brought $6.8 million in
1986. Last year, the Kruses coaxed bids of $152 million on about
10,000 automobiles.
   The business started in 1971 at Auburn's annual weekend car
festival. Dean Kruse, a successful local auctioneer of real estate
and household goods, noticed many of the old cars carried for-sale
signs. So he stepped in and set up an auction.
   ``We had a rope as a gate, and 3,500 people paid $1 to get in,
and another 3,500 jumped the rope,'' said the younger Kruse. ``A
man turned down $35,000 for his Duesenberg, which was just unheard
of because they were selling for about $5,000 to $10,000 at the
time.''
   The auction became an annual Labor Day weekend event and sales
jumped. Their calendar takes the Kruses across the United States
and Europe, with auctions in Switzerland and Luxembourg, as well as
major sales in Reno, Nev., Atlantic City and Florida.
   ``We've really developed Florida as a market in the last couple
of years because of the incredible wealth down there,'' said Kruse.
   The Kruses claim to hold 75 percent of the market.
   Wherever they go, their sales technique doesn't vary much from
the manner that sells low-price household goods at a farm auction.
Sell the sizzle, the Kruses say, not the steak.
   ``You can have a frying pan, and go `One dollar, two dollar,
three dollar,''' said Kruse. ``Or you can say, `Oh, I can smell my
grandmother's fried chicken in there right now. Who'll gimme $20?'''
   Kruse's picks for today's best bets to become the classics of
the future include the limited edition Buick GNX, Mustang
convertibles, Corvettes, the IROC-Z Camaro, maybe the Cadillac
Allante, and the Avanti, created by Studebaker designer Raymond
Loewy and now in limited production under owner Michael Kelly.
   The keys to collectibility are condition, design, horsepower and
historical significance, Kruse said. People seem to value notoriety
more than wholesome fame.
   ``Usually if a bad guy owned it, it's worth more than if a good
guy owned it,'' he said.
   Does it seem like there are limitless numbers of Hitler staff
cars?
   Kruse says there are more than 20 of the Mercedes 770-K models,
many protected by armor plate and bulletproof glass, that might be
touted as Hitler's personal car.
   ``If (reich marshal Hermann) Goering even looked at it, it's a
Hitler car,'' Kruse said.

<TEXT>
   Officials from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed Monday that a meeting of
the cartel's price monitoring committee would be held Aug. 3 in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
   The confirmation of the date, which had been tentatively set,
came in the wake of a visit to the United Arab Emirates by OPEC
Secretary-General Subroto.
   The five-nation price monitoring committee, made up of the oil
ministers of Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and
Venzuela, is empowered to study the situation on world oil markets
and can also call an extraordinary meeting of all 13 OPEC member
countries' oil ministers.
   OPEC officials hope to stabilize the cartel's price fluctuations
and runaway overproduction now that Iran and Iraq are negotiating
to end the eight-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   The last ministerial meeting, held in Vienna in June, failed to
unify the cartel on the pricing and production issues.
   The next OPEC ministerial meeting is scheduled for December.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
higher but off the day's peak Monday in the wake of advances in New
York and Tokyo.
   Takeover speculation surrounding certain stocks boosted the
market briefly around midday. But the speculation died down later,
and the overall level of business remained low, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 8.6
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,862.2. The index hit a high of 13.3
points up at about 3:30 p.m. local time.
   Volume was a moderate 381.7 million shares, down from 479.2
million shares on Friday.
   The day's positive tone was set by Wall Street's surge on
Friday, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.40 points to
2,128.73. Tokyo shares also rose earlier Monday, with the Nikkei
index up 126.70 at 28,326.31.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 7.8 points at
1,496.5.
   The Financial Times 500-share index rose 5.67 points to close at
1,061.6.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed against other major
currencies in Europe on Monday.
   Trading was light and the dollar stayed in a narrow range,
dealers said.
   Gold prices fell, with markets quiet due to a Swiss national
holiday.
   Traders in London said early attempts to push the dollar to new
highs met with fears of central bank intervention and profit-taking.
   ``Everybody's worried about the central banks,'' said a trader
for a U.S. bank.
   ``I still think there will be an attempt to set higher levels,''
on Tuesday, he added.
   Some traders said the dollar's failure to break new ground
suggested that it may have to drop back and establish a bottom
before proceeding higher.
   ``Having just come off the highs and heading down ... it looks a
bit more vulnerable on the downside,'' a trader said.
   Corporate customers, meanwhile, ``just aren't around'' owing to
summer holidays, another trader said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7130, compared with
$1.7105 on Friday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.72 yen to a closing 133.25 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at the lower rate of 132.75 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.8758 West German marks, up from 1.8750; 1.5615 Swiss francs,
unchanged; 6.3255 French francs, up from 6.3202; 2.1145 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1185; 1,381.50 Italian lire, up from
1,377.75; 1.2075 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2105
   Gold fell in London to a bid price of $433.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $435.25.
   Zurich was closed for a Swiss national holiday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 87 cents to close at a bid
$436.70.
   Silver was quoted late Monday in London at a bid price of $6.81
a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday.

   The stock market was little changed today as
traders took a break to digest last week's sharp gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged 46 points
on Friday, was unchanged at 2,128.73 at midafternoon.
   Losers narrowly outpaced gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 675 issues up, 712 down and
501 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 105.03 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices came under some selling pressure after a mixed
opening but untimately were little changed. Analysts were
encouraged by the restrained approach to equities.
   ``This is extremely healthy, a little consolidation,'' said
Philip Puccio, a senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Co. ``The
market really hasn't given up much ground.''
   Analysts said they would have been far more concerned had the
market opened on a strong note, building too quickly on last week's
gains.
   ``What you don't want to see is instant euphoria,'' said Larry
Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A measured approach to the market could mean better things down

   Market watchers have been reluctant to proclaim that the Dow's
summer rally is back on track despite its 68-point surge last week,
the key barometer's biggest weekly gain since April.
   But with traders and institutions taking some profits today,
Puccio said the market likely is being positioned to move higher
later in the week since underlying sentiment remains positive.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Gillette was down 2\ at

   Control Data Corp. has established a
secured $225 million line of credit with a group of nine banks led
by Bank of America, the computer company said Monday.
   The arrangement, Control Data's first line of credit in the
United States since its financial restructuring in 1986, provides
for up to $125 million in standby letters of credit and up to $100
million of revolving credit, the company said in a prepared
statement.
   The line of credit will provide Control Data with a less
expensive and more flexible source of money for financing
day-to-day business, the company said.
   In addition to Bank of America, participating banks include the
Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays Bank PLC, Chemical Bank, Continental
Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, First Bank
National Association, Irving Trust Company, Morgan Guaranty Trust
Company of New York and Norwest Bank Minnesota.
   Control Data, with $3.4 billion in revenues in 1987, provides
computer products and services for science, engineering and
business applications worldwide.

<HEAD>Boeing Profits Up 36.8 Percent In Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher sales and lower expenses and taxes helped
boost Boeing Co.'s second-quarter profits 36.8 percent over the
same period of 1987, the Seattle-based aerospace company said today.
   Boeing reported net earnings of $160 million or $1.05 a share on
sales of $4.71 billion, compared with profits of $117 million or 75
cents a share on sales of $3.48 billion a year ago.
   For the first half of 1988, Boeing had profits of $296 million
or $1.94 a share on sales of $8.32 billion, up 26 percent from
first-half 1987 profits of $235 million or $1.51 a share on sales
of $7.24 billion.
   In a news release, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer
Frank Shrontz attributed the brighter performance to increased
sales volume; lower levels of research and development and other
new business costs for computing, electronics and military and
space programs; and lower federal tax rates.
   But Shrontz said the gains were offset somewhat by ``significant
performance problems'' on several military airplane programs;
increased research and development and production costs at Boeing's
deHavilland commuter plane division; and having to bear a larger
share of expenses on government contracts.
   Boeing enjoyed record orders of $13.3 billion for commercial
planes in the second quarter, with 23 customers ordering 268 jets
and 29 turboprop commuter planes. That compares with orders
totaling $7.6 billion for second-quarter 1987.
   For the six months ending June 30, Boeing had orders for 397
jets and 35 turboprop planes valued at $18 billion. In the same
period of 1987, there were 208 jets and 34 prop planes ordered,
worth a total $11.1 billion.
   Boeing is expected to have its fourth straight year of record
orders for commercial jets. The company, however, does not receive
payment for planes until they are delivered, which can be years
after the orders were entered.
   Military sales in the first half totaled $2.4 billion, $200
million less than in the same period of 1987. Shrontz said military
sales for 1988 are expected to be slightly less than last year.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Inches up 0.1 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for digest item slugged AM-Construction Spending.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending inched up 0.1 percent in
June as a big increase in investment for new factories helped
offset declines in housing and government projects, the Commerce
Department said Monday.
   Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted, but not
inflation-adjusted, annual rate of $402.8 billion in June,
following a 0.8 percent increase in May.
   Construction spending for the first half of 1988 was only 1.3
percent above the January-June period of 1987, lagging behind the
2.0 percent rate of inflation in construction costs between the two
periods.
   Analysts had been expecting even greater weakness, predicting
office and hotel construction would decline in response to high
vacancy rates. But projects are getting built anyway.
   ``What is happening is ... there is a lot of money available,
from here and overseas,'' said economist Michael Sumichrast, who
heads a consulting firm in Washington.
   Different aspects of the same phenomenon are fueling both the
increase in factory investment, which rose 5.7 percent in June and
stands 21 percent higher than it was a year ago, and the growing
availability of money for other construction projects.
   U.S. manufacturers are spending more on new equipment and
building projects to meet higher demand for U.S. goods overseas.
They're finally benefiting from the fall in the value of the dollar
between early 1985 and the end of 1987, which made American goods
cheaper on foreign markets.
   However, although the trade deficit is not as bad as it was,
foreigners still collect more dollars than they need to buy
American goods and thus look for ways to invest that money.
   The Japanese, particularly, prefer to invest surplus dollars in
government securities and real estate, rather than in other
investments such as corporate stock.
   ``There's one good (real estate) deal for every 50 that you
bring to the table, but the money has to be put someplace. ... I'm
afraid we're going to continue to build in some areas where we
shouldn't really build,'' Sumichrast said.
   For the rest of the year, analysts are expecting a continued
softening of construction activity, led by weakness in housing,
which is being hurt by an upward creep in mortgage interest rates.
   Residential construction fell 0.9 percent in June to an annual
rate of $188.1 billion, the third decline in a row. A 0.7 percent
drop in construction of single-family homes more than offset a 2.3
percent increase in apartment construction.
   John Savacool, an economist with the Wefa Group in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., said factory construction will likely strengthen and
residential building wane through the rest of this year.
   However, he said, if the recent appreciation in the dollar,
which has rebounded somewhat from its lows at the end of last year,
continues, it could choke off the U.S. manufacturing boom and
dampen the main area of construction strength.
   The Commerce Department offered these details of construction
spending in June:
   _Non-residential private construction climbed 2.5 percent, the
fourth consecutive monthly increase, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $99.2 billion.
   _Hotel and motel construction increased 19.4 percent after
falling for two months. Analysts said the category swings widely
from month to month because one or two large projects can skew the
total.
   _Construction of office buildings was off by 0.4 percent from
the May level. However, the small decline followed increases in
May, April and March, and the June rate was still 12 percent higher
than a year earlier.
   _Shopping center and other commercial construction was unchanged
from May.
   _Government construction projects fell 1.4 percent in June to an
annual rate of $78.6 billion with highway construction, the biggest
segment of the government sector, suffering a 1.6 percent decline.

<HEAD>Most Plant Managers Expect Production Gains in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most U.S. plant managers expect their production
and new orders to increase in the third quarter, continuing the
rebound in the nation's manufacturing industry, according to a
survey released Monday.
   The survey by Dun & Bradstreet Corp. of 1,500 plant managers
around the country showed that 46 percent of them expect their
production to rise in the current quarter, while only 14 percent
anticipate declines. Forty-seven percent of the managers predicted
third-quarter increases in new factory orders while 15 percent
forecast declines.
   The plant managers' expectations for the third quarter, however,
were slightly less optimistic than their projections for the second
quarter. That was because manufacturing growth has been so
explosive and can be expected to slow a bit, Dun & Bradstreet said.
   The business information company said plant managers are a good
barometer of the nation's manufacturing industry, since they
receive information on anticipated demand, orders, prices and
production costs. It was the second time that Dun & Bradstreet did
a quarterly survey of plant managers' expectations.
   ``This is really a continuation of a bullish outlook for the
Rust Belt economy,'' said Joseph W. Duncan, corporate economist and
chief statistician for Dun & Bradstreet. ``Though the outlook for
the third quarter among manufacturers is not as strong as it was
for the second quarter, the current level of expectations
represents a quantum leap in optimism since the October (stock
market) crash.''
   The 46 percent of the plant managers expecting production to
increase in the third quarter was down from 55 percent in the
second quarter. Managers predicting gains in new orders declined to
47 percent from 56 percent.
   ``The manufacturing sector needs time to readjust after bursts
of growth like the one it just came through,'' Duncan said. ``It is
during these momentary lulls that capacity is adjusted, production
schedules are revised and the groundwork is laid for future
expansion.''
   He said it is remarkable that so many plant managers expect
continued production increases, given the fact that much of the
nation's manufacturing industry already has been producing close to
maximum capacity. The dollar's marked decline in recent years has
made U.S. goods cheaper and more attractive overseas, stimulating
the industrial machine to produce more and straining its capacity.
   Similarly, for the next 12 months, most of the plant managers
polled had slightly less optimistic expectations than in the
previous survey.
   Fifty-nine percent of the managers expect production to increase
during the next year, down from 63 percent. Those anticipating a
rise in new orders slipped to 58 percent from 63 percent.

<HEAD>US Export-Iport Bank Resumes Lending to Brazil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government's Export-Import Bank
announced on Monday that its board of directors has agreed to
resume lending to Brazil to encourage sales of U.S. goods there.
   The action follows an agreement reached in Paris over the
weekend between Brazil and 13 creditor governments, including the
United States. This accord will delay repayments on $5 billion
worth of debt falling due between Jan. 1, 1987 and March 31, 1990.
   Sergio Amaral, head of the Brazilian delegation, said that none
of the interest or principal will be repaid until the end of that
period. Payments will then be spread over 10 years. It is unusual
for such arrangements to delay payments of both interest and
principal.
   The U.S. bank announced on July 11 that it was accepting
applications for loans to Brazil and that a decision would be made
after the Paris talks.
   ``This condition has been satisfied and Eximbank now is prepared
to act on preliminary and final commitments,'' said the bank's
president, John A. Bohn, Jr., in a statement.
   Brazil's international credit was badly hurt in February 1987
when it stopped paying interest on more than $60 billion of its
bank debt, the biggest in the Third World. It now has an agreement
with a committee representing its bank creditors to delay payments
on about $62 billion, and to take new loans of $5.2 billion from
the banks to help pay them the back interest.
   The committee is collecting approvals from over 600 creditor
banks for this arrangement. The International Monetary Fund, owned
by 151 governments, has said it will also lend Brazil more money
when the banks have agreed.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged 46 points
on Friday, was up 1.96 at 2,130.69 an hour before the closing bell.
   Gainers outpaced losers by about 8 to 7 in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 755 issues up, 662 down
and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 120.02 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices seesawed slightly after a mixed opening but managed
to hold their ground. Analysts were encouraged by the restrained
approach to equities.
   ``This is extremely healthy,'' said Philip Puccio, a senior vice
president at Dillon, Read & Co. ``The market really hasn't given up
much ground.''
   Analysts said they would have been far more concerned had the
market opened on a strong note and built too quickly on last week's
gains.
   ``What you don't want to see is instant euphoria,'' said Larry
Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A measured approach to the market could mean better things down
the road. ``That's the kind of action you get prior to a trend
resuming,'' Wachtel said.
   Market watchers have been reluctant to proclaim the Dow's summer
rally back on track despite its 68-point surge last week, the key
barometer's biggest weekly gain since April.
   But with traders and institutions taking some profits today,
Puccio said the market likely is being positioned to move higher
later in the week since underlying sentiment remains positive.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Gillette was down 2{ at
37|; the razor blade maker settled its legal dispute with Consiton
Partners and will buy back 16 million shares for $45 each.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Skyrocket As Hot Weather Returns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean, corn and oat futures skyrocketed their
permitted daily limits Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
fears that a new heat wave in the Midwest will do further damage to
drought-stressed crops.
   Wheat futures also closed sharply higher.
   The return of hot, dry weather to the Corn Belt after a two-week
reprieve holds a particular threat to the soybean crop, which is in
the middle of its critical pod-filling stage, analysts said.
   High temperatures _ 95 degrees or higher _ are more detrimental
to soybeans at this growth stage than lack of moisture, said Rich
Feltes, director of commodity research with Refco Inc., a large,
Chicago-based commodities brokerage house.
   Temperatures soared into the upper 90s Monday afternoon in the
central Corn Belt states of Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin
and the hot, dry weather was expected to persist for most of the
week.
   ``If these high temperatures continue, we're looking at a
potentially serious shortfall in soybean production, even with the
recent rains in the eastern Corn Belt,'' Feltes said.
   Most contracts for future delivery of oats, corn and soybeans
closed up their respective daily limits of 10 cents, 15 cents and
45 cents a bushel. The August soybean contract, on which the limit
has been removed pending the contract's expiration later this
month, closed more than 60 cents higher.
   At the close, wheat was 9 cents to 15 cents higher with
September at $3.81 a bushel; corn was 13} cents to 15 cents higher
with September at $2.90 a bushel; oats were 10 cents higher across
the board with September at $2.81{ a bushel; soybeans were 28{
cents to 64 cents higher with August at $8.40 a bushel.

<HEAD>AGB Suspends U.S. Television Ratings Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AGB Television Research is suspending its U.S.
television ratings operation, saying it underestimated the costs of
competing with audience measurement leader A.C. Nielsen.
   The disclosure disappointed some advertising and television
industry executives, who said AGB had provided some competition in
the national TV ratings arena that has been dominated for 30 years
by Nielsen.
   ``They had breathed some life into what had been an inactive
portion of the business,'' an executive of a major advertiser said
Monday, speaking on condition he not be identified.
   But others said Nielsen still faces potential competition from
companies such as Arbitron Ratings Co., which has announced plans
to launch a national TV ratings service over the next few years
that also will monitor buying habits.
   AGB, a limited partnership in which the British concern AGB
Research PLC had a major interest, is widely credited _ or blamed,
depending on the view _ with encouraging use of ``people meters''
in measuring national TV audiences.
   The people meter is a handheld device that not only
electronically records when the television is on, but permits
viewers to push buttons to record exactly who is watching at any
given time.
   After years of use in Europe, AGB decided to employ the devices
as it launched its U.S. television ratings operation in the fall of
1987.
   Nielsen had been testing its own people meter, and announced it
would rely on the device for its 1987-88 ratings as well. Under its
old system, Nielsen used a combination of meters to measure when
sets were on and handwritten diaries to tell who watched particular
shows.
   Critics of the old system said an explosion in viewing choices
made it increasingly unrealistic for anyone to record accurately in
a diary what everyone in the family watched. But others said the
people meters have shortcomings as well, such as in measuring
viewing by children.
   ``If it hadn't been for AGB coming into the market with their
people meter, I don't think Nielsen would have come out as soon
with their people meter,'' said Jack Otter, a senior vice president
at the advertising agency McCann-Erickson Worldwide.
   But the cost of the ratings service was more than AGB had
expected.
   The London-based AGB Research said it had estimated in April
1987 that it would cost $49 million for the U.S. service, but that
within a year the complexities of the market had driven costs past
$67 million.
   ``Following discussions with the TV networks, advertising
agencies and advertisers, it became clear that despite considerable
support, the prospects for future revenue would not make the
project viable and would be unlikely to cover the increased level
of costs,'' the company said.
   This past spring, AGB approached the three major television
networks in an effort to get all three to sign up for this fall and
beyond.
   CBS had been the only major network to subscribe to the AGB
ratings in the 1987-88 season, and getting ABC and NBC to join was
seen not only as a way to boost revenue for AGB but also as a
signal to advertisers and their agencies of the prospects for the
service.
   ``It is disappointing to have one of the competitors gone,''
said Paul Sonkin, vice president for network audience research at
Capital Cities-ABC. But he said ABC decided against subscribing
because of the cost.
   Asked for a response to AGB's announcement, Nielsen's chairman
and chief executive, John C. Holt, said, ``Our operating assumption
that the television audience measurement business is a competitive
one remains unchanged.''
   At Arbitron, spokeswoman Nan Myers said the AGB decision will
have no effect on that company's plans, which call for introduction
of a system that monitors both viewing and buying habits in five
major markets in the fall of 1989 and expansion into a national
system in the fall of 1990.
   She noted Arbitron has been measuring local audiences in the
United States for years and has a long-term commitment to a
national service.
   In announcing Arbtron's plans in June, Arbitron Presdident A.J.
Aurichio said he expected Arbitron would lose $125 million on the
syswtem over four to five years before breaking even in 1995.
   In announcing the suspension of its television ratings service,
AGB Research also announced it would acquire Mediamark Research
Inc., which measures magazine audiences, in an exchange of stock.
   Timothy Joyce, chairman of Mediamark, said AGB's choice of the
word ``suspension'' in describing the status of its AGB Television
operation in the United States was deliberate, leaving open the
possibility that it could be resurrected in another form at some
future date.

   Lockheed Corp. said Monday it has

Lawrence O. Kitchen as chairman and chief executive offer when
Kitchen retires at the end of this year.
   Tellep, 56, group president of Lockheed Missiles and Space

corporation to ease the transition to the top office, Lockheed
announced.
   The company's current president, Robert Fuhrman, 63, was named
vice chairman and chief operating officer.
   Tellep joined Lockheed in 1955 as principal scientist for the
X-17 missile re-entry flight experiments and has held a series of
engineering and administrative posts.
   Kitchen, who reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 earlier
this year, will remain on Lockheed's board of directors. Kitchen
became chairman and chief executive officer in 1986 after 10 years
as president and chief operating officer.
   Succeeding Tellep as president of the Sunnyvale-based Missiles

   The stock market managed to hold onto recent
gains today despite sporadic bouts of profit-taking.
   Stock prices seesawed slightly after a mixed opening but the
market ultimately remained firm.
   Analysts were encouraged by traders' restrained approach to
equities following last week's 68-point jump in the Dow Jones

   ``The market is holding rather tenaciously to that gain,'' noted
Michael Metz, vice president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer &

   Metz said strength in the bond market supported equities, with
some investors concluding that ``we may have seen the worst in the
rise of long-term (interest) rates.''
   Analysts said they would have been far more concerned had the
market opened on a strong note and built too quickly on last week's

   A measured approach to the market could mean better things down

   Market watchers have been reluctant to proclaim the summer rally
back on track despite the market's recent gains.

<HEAD>South Africa Bill Would Cost Americans $1.2 Billion, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. investors could lose $1.2 billion on their
shares in South African gold mining stocks if legislation requiring
Americans to sell all their investments in South Africa becomes
law, a report said Monday.
   The legislation introduced by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., is
intended to bring pressure on South Africa to end its system of
apartheid, in which the black majority has no voice in national
affairs.
   Americans would lose money because the legislation would force
them to sell at depressed, ``fire sale'' prices, the study said.
The report was based on economists' models of the interaction of
supply and demand.
   The study was conducted by the Wefa Group, a consulting firm
based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., on behalf of International Investors
Inc., a New York-based mutual fund that invests in precious metals
mining stocks and has about 40 percent of its assets in South
Africa.
   Americans owned $4.5 billion in South African mining shares as
of the end of 1987, and of that, $3.2 billion was in gold mining
shares, making it the single most popular South African investment
for Americans, the study said. International Investors estimated
that about 500,000 Americans own shares in gold mining stocks.
   The study did not attempt to calculate overall losses to
American investors if the bill became law.
   A Dellums spokesman, R.H. Miller, said the congressman believes
negative effects of the bill would be temporary because the end of
apartheid would free the South African economy from its ``state of
siege.''
   The legislation is sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. stores will begin offering
appliances and home electronic equipment carrying outside brand
names _ a first for the nation's largest retailer, officials said
Monday.
   Some 60 national brands, including Sears' Kenmore appliances,
will be available Thursday at 13 Indiana stores, Sears officials
said in a statement.
   Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears
Merchandise Group, said the move at the Indiana stores marks a
``first step'' in Sears' plan to sell outside-brand appliances at
its stores across the nation.
   ``We will begin our national rollout early in 1989, on an
average of more than one store a day,'' Bozic said.
   The new variety of brand names will be offered at ``Brand
Central'' departments, which Sears bills as ``a superstore within a
store.''
   Free-standing Brand Central stores also are planned, promoted as
``the brands you want at the store you trust,'' Bozic said.
   Outside-brand telephones, stereo equipment, televisions,
electronic office equipment and kitchen appliances are among the
products to be offered, said Marvin Stern, a company vice president.
   ``We see this as a great opportunity to strengthen Sears'
position as America's leading appliance retailer,'' Bozic said.
   Sears now operates 819 multi-line retail stores and more than
3,000 other retail, catalog and specialty stores in all 50 states
and Puerto Rico, company officials said.

   The dollar finished lower against most major
currencies Monday amid fears that central banks could intervene to
drive the dollar down.
   Gold prices also declined. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid price for gold of $434.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, down from $436 late Friday.
   The dollar ended lower in New York after rising in the Far East
and trading mixed in Europe. Apprehension about possible renewed
dollar sales by the central banks of major industrial countries
kept activity subdued, traders said.
   Attempts early in the trading day to push the dollar to new

intervention worries, dealers said.
   Currency traders also were holding back in anticipation of
Tuesday's government report on the leading economic indicators for
June, a key signal of strength in the economy.
   ``Essentially, what you have is a market looking for

   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.72 Japanese yen to a closing 133.25 yen. Later,

   The British pound rose to $1.7130 in London, more expensive than
$1.7105 on Friday. In late New York trading, the pound was quoted

   The Gillette Co. and Coniston Partners ended a
six-month power struggle Monday with settlement of lawsuits over
their proxy fight earlier this year.
   As part of the settlement, Gillette will buy back an estimated
16 million shares at $45 each, or a total of $720 million.
   The deal also contains a ``stand-still'' agreement, under which
Coniston said it would not buy significant numbers of Gillette
shares, participate in any proxy contest or otherwise seek control
of the company for three years.
   The settlement ends Coniston's suit stemming from the April 21
proxy vote it lost to Gillette. As a result, the personal care
products giant does not face a rerun of the election.
   A federal judge said last month he was inclined to order a new
vote because Gillette misled stockholders in an advertisement about
Coniston before the election.
   Industry analysts have said a rematch would have strengthened
Coniston's hand.
   Under terms of the settlement, all Gillette stockholders may
sell one share back to the company at $45 for each seven they own.
   Gillette officials estimated the total number of shares likely
to be purchased under the settlement agreement are about 16 million
of the approximately 112 million outstanding shares.
   Edward Froelich, an analyst with Pershing & Co., said that the
settlement means that Gillette management ``wants to keep the
status quo. But they're shrinking the capital and diluting earnings
a bit.''
   After Revlon chairman Ronald O. Perelman's failed bid for
Gillette in 1986, Gillette paid $558 million to buy back 9.2
million shares of stock. But Froelich said the company will be able
to continue to fight off such takeover attempts ``as long as they
keep the earnings rising and they have. I don't think the
stockholders will be too badly off.''
   Gillette stock plunged $2.62{ a share to $37.50 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Coniston, which owns nearly 6 percent of Gillette stock, forced
the proxy vote earlier this year in hopes of winning four
directors' seats to pressure the 12-member Gillette board to sell
the company. Coniston believes a sale would boost the value of
Gillette stock.
   Gillette filed suit April 14 seeking to block Coniston's proxy
bid on the grounds that Coniston falsified Securities and Exchange
Commission filings and di not fully disclose all investors.
   A countersuit filed by Coniston five days later alleged Gillette
misrepresented Coniston in advertisements and mailings to the
company's 27,000 shareholders and failed to publicly disclose all
companies that had expressed interest in buying Gillette.
   U.S. District Court Judge Mark L. Wolf ruled in early April that
Gillette inaccurately portrayed Coniston in newspaper
advertisements leading up to the proxy vote in which shareholders
rejected a Coniston slate of four dierctor candidates.
   Paul Tierney Jr., a Coniston general partner, issued a statement
saying: ``We believe this settlement at this time is in the best
interests of all concerned.''
   Joan Fitzgerald, spokeswoman for Gillette, maintained that ``all
shareholders will benefit'' from the repurchase agreement and said
it was not dissimilar to a buy-back plan announced by the company
for shareholders in 1986, prior to the Coniston action.

   The stock market finished mixed Monday but
largely resisted traders' sporadic efforts to cash in on last
week's sharp gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged 68 points
last week, inched up 1.78 to close at 2,130.51.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 11-to-9 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
830 issues up, 672 down and 481 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 138.17 million shares,
down from 192.34 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
157.84 million shares.
   Stock prices opened mixed and seesawed in a narrow range. While
traders wondered whether last week's gains could be sustained,
analysts were divided over just how healthy the day's trading
shaped up to be.
   Some were encouraged that the market held its ground. ``The
market is holding rather tenaciously to (last week's) gain,'' noted
Michael Metz, vice president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer &
Co. ``It is absorbing profit-taking with relative ease.''
   A stronger bond market and a rise in the Dow's key
transportation sector helped support equities.
   But other observers, pointing to anemic volume and a lack of a
conviction, were not so satisfied.
   ``All last week's rally did was recover losses from the prior
week,'' said Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney
Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. He noted that stocks moved to
``the upper end of their trading range and then ran out of
momentum.''
   Those who appeared pleased with the day's events said they would
have been far more concerned had the market's upward move resumed
at a brisk pace.
   ``What you don't want to see is instant euphoria,'' said Larry
Wachtel, first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A measured approach to the market could mean better things down
the road. ``That's the kind of action you get prior to a trend
resuming,'' Wachtel said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NV Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, Monday
named a new chief executive at North American Philips Corp. and
split off $1 billion worth of peripheral operations into an
independent subsidiary.
   Philips said the changes, which will take effect Sept. 1, were
intended to ``further integrate the Philips organization in the
U.S.A. into the global activities of the company.''
   Philips, Europe's largest electronics company and the world's
No. 1 television manufacturer, last week reported a 44 percent
decline in its second-quarter profit. It blamed foreign-currency
losses and competition from Southeast Asia.
   Named to be chairman and chief executive of New York-based North
American Philips was Gerrit Jeelof, who will continue as executive
vice president and vice chairman at the parent company, based in
Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
   Cees Bruynes, who has held the top post at North American
Philips, will become the chairman and chief executive of a new
subsidiary, Consolidated Electronics Industries Corp., Philips said.
   The new subsidiary will include the Magnavox defense contracting
business, which had to be kept independent of the Dutch-based
company because of Pentagon rules. It will also include a variety
of peripheral businesses ranging from Anchor Brush toothbrushes and
Genie garage door openers to Selmer musical instruments and
Magnavox cable television equipment.
   The creation of Consolidated Electronics Industries should not
be considered a prelude to the disposal of some of the businesses
in it, said Albert A. Ruttner, a vice president at North American
Philips.
   The operations to be included in the new subsidiary accounted
for about $1 billion of North American Philips' 1987 revenue of
$5.5 billion and about 15,500 of its 59,000 employees.
   Philips' brand names include Philips, Norelco, Magnavox, Philco
and Sylvania.

<HEAD>Pryor Bill Would Require Registration of Consultants</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private consultants to defense contractors
would have to register with the federal government under provisions
of a bill introduced in the Senate on Monday by Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark.
   Pryor chairs the Senate Government Affairs federal service
subcommittee, which has held a series of hearings on the use of
consultants by Pentagon contractors.
   ``The bill is intended to shed some sunshine on the
all-too-shadowy world of consultants. Bringing everything into the
light should cut down on the shady dealings,'' said Pryor.
   He was referring to the current investigation that focuses on
allegations that contractors' consultants, many of them former
Pentagon employees, paid bribes to current Defense Department
workers for inside information about contracts. No charges have yet
been filed.
   Federal officials testified to Pryor's subcommittee that they
didn't know specifically how much was being spent on consultants.
In part, that lack of knowledge comes from the fact that contracts
don't have to detail services provided by consultants.
   Pryor's bill would create a registry of consultants and no
consultants could be hired unless they were registered. That
registration would require detailed information about the identity
of a consultant's clients along with the services provided by the
consultant.
   The bill would also detail a new category in federal budgets,
requiring government departments to list the amount they spend on
consultants.

<HEAD>Antifreeze Prices Seen Rising On Tighter Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low supplies have doubled the price of
antifreeze to about $7 a gallon and may drive it even higher,
suppliers and distributors say.
   Supplies have been limited by a shortage of ethylene glycol, the
base for antifreeze, and by a series of explosions and fires at
antifreeze production plants, distributors told the Omaha
World-Herald.
   ``There's going to be a situation this fall where shelves are
quite empty,'' said Mike Mielenz, manager of specialty products for
Texaco Inc. in Houston.
   Antifreeze is used in the cooling systems of cars and other
vehicles to protect their engines from freezing in the winter and
overheating in the summer.
   Riaz Waraich, president of Old World Trading Co., one of the
country's major antifreeze suppliers, said the antifreeze shortage
is a long-term problem caused by the shortage of ethylene glycol, a
compound derived from natural gas that is the base for plastics and
polyesters as well as antifreeze.
   Antifreeze, the smallest and least profitable part of the
ethylene glycol market, is losing the competition to plastics,
which are in high demand, Waraich said from Des Plaines, Ill.
   Just when demand for the compound was increasing, a series of
refinery explosions took a big bite out of the ethylene glycol
supply.
   Explosions last year in plants in Antwerp, Belgium, and Saudi
Arabia reduced supplies worldwide. In May, an explosion shut down a
Shell Oil Co. refinery in Norco, La. In June, fire swept a Texaco
plant.
   The disasters cut 35 million to 40 million gallons of antifreeze
from the U.S. market, which uses 200 million gallons annually,
Waraich said.
   ``The real impact will be felt in October-November when John
Public goes to the store for his coolant,'' said Waraich, whose
company produces Peak, Advance and Full Force brands of antifreeze.
   Some in the industry said some consumers and suppliers are
hoarding antifreeze, making the crunch worse. Others said suppliers
actually have restricted their orders to prevent hoarding.
   Lonn Harlan, district manager of Rennoco Oil Co. in Omaha, a
wholesale antifreeze distributor, said that due to higher prices
from suppliers his company has boosted wholesale prices of
antifreeze from $3.23 to $7.18 per gallon in the last four months.
   Rennoco could have to boost prices to more than $11 a gallon
wholesale by Jan. 1, Harlan said.
   Target Stores' antifreeze prices have climbed from $3.99 a
gallon in June to $8 a gallon for Prestone and $6 for Xerex, said
George Hite, vice president for public and consumer affairs.
   K mart stores will take a loss on antifreeze sales because of
the shortage, said Don Thompson, sports-auto manager at the chain's
Omaha store.
   Increased production is not possible in the short run, industry
spokesmen said.
   The Shell plant in Louisiana and the Texaco plant are not back
at full production and the United States can not restore its lost
supply of ethylene glycol because it can not import the raw
material, Waraich said. Importing ethylene gas requires special
shipping terminals the United States does not have, he said.

   Soybean, corn and oat futures prices shot up their permitted
daily limits Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that
the latest heat wave in the Midwest will do further damage to
drought-stressed crops.
   Wheat futures also closed sharply higher.
   On other exchanges, coffee futures plummeted; cattle futures
were sharply higher while pork futures were sharply lower; precious
metals were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index
futures retreated.
   The return of hot, dry weather to the Corn Belt after a two-week
reprieve holds a particular threat to the soybean crop, which is in
the middle of its critical pod-filling stage, analysts said.
   Hot temperatures _ 95 degrees or higher _ are even more
detrimental to soybeans than lack of moisture at this growth stage,
said Rich Feltes, director of commodity research with Refco Inc., a
large, Chicago-based commodities brokerage house.
   Temperatures approached or exceeded 100 degrees Monday afternoon
in the central Corn Belt states of Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and
Wisconsin and the hot, dry weather was expected to persist for most
of the week.
   ``If these high temperatures continue, we're looking at a
potentially serious shortfall in soybean production, even with the
recent rains in the eastern Corn Belt,'' Feltes said.
   Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
the critical period for soybean development would run through the
third week in August.
   ``The next two to three weeks are going to make or bake the
soybean crop, and it looks like we're going to bake it,'' he said.
   Most contracts for future delivery of oats, corn and soybeans
closed up their respective daily limits of 10 cents, 15 cents and
45 cents a bushel. The August soybean contract, on which the limit
has been removed pending the contract's expiration later this
month, gained 63 cents.
   Wheat settled 8{ cents to 14 cents higher with September at
$3.81 a bushel; corn was 13} cents to 15 cents higher with
September at $2.90 a bushel; oats were 10 cents higher across the
board with September at $2.81{ a bushel; and soybeans were 27 cents
to 63 cents higher with August at $8.39 a bushel.
   Hot weather also contributed to limit losses in coffee futures
on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange.
   Coffee consumption typically hits its lowest point in
mid-summer, and expectations that cash prices will fall prompted
heavy speculative selling of coffee futures, said Sandra Kaul, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Three coffee contracts settled down the 6-cent daily limit. The
limitless September contract plunged 8.05 cents to settle at
$1.1667 a pound.
   Cattle futures dipped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
response to Friday's semi-annual cattle inventory report from the
Agriculture Department, which showed the nation's cattle herd to be
larger than the markets had anticipated.
   Analysts said the sharp rise in grain prices also weighed on
prices for near-term delivery of cattle; feeder cattle for
September and October delivery plunged the 1.50-cents-a-pound daily
limit.
   Limit advances in the pork pits were fueled by fears that hot,
humid weather would decrease the number of hogs brought to market
this week and by rising cash prices for pork bellies, said Philip
Stanley, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Live cattle were .35 cent to .95 cent lower with August at 66.17
cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.50 cents lower to .10 cent
higher with August at 78.37 cents a pound; hogs were .55 cent to
1.50 cents higher with August at 45.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to 2 cents higher with August at 32.52 cents
a pound.
   Silver futures gained while gold retreated on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   Silver, which had fallen sharply last week, bounced back on
bargain hunting and confirmation that Peru's state-owned mining
company, Centromin, had stated it might not meet its contractual
obligations to deliver silver due to a 2-week-old miners' strike,
analysts said.
   Gold settled $1.70 lower across the board with August at $434.40
a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.9 cents higher with September
at $6.915 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil futures prices fell slightly and oil products finished
mixed in quiet trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
traders looked ahead to Wednesday's scheduled meeting of OPEC's
price monitoring committee.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 25 cents
lower with September at $16.08 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with September at 45.12 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .70 cent lower to .46 cent higher with
September at 48.59 cents a gallon.
   Stock index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .60 point lower at 272.65.

<HEAD>No Invasion, But Bringing Team From North Carolina Took Some
Planning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They prefer not to call it an invasion, but it was
a meticulously planned operation that brought about 250 NCNB Corp.
officials to Texas to take over the state's largest bank holding
company.
   With military-like precision and secrecy to match, the North
Carolina bankers set up camp at a Dallas hotel and waited for the
announcement that finally brought the failing First RepublicBank
Corp. into their fold last Friday.
   ``We were all real pleased,'' said Brad Iversen, NCBC's senior
vice president for marketing on Monday. ``There haven't been any
hitches at all.''
   The NCNB employees were flown into Dallas late Thursday and
early Friday morning, expecting a Dallas press conference that
would mark the end of First RepublicBank's Texas banking presence
and the birth of NCNB Texas National Bank.
   Rumors had circulated earlier in the week that NCNB had a lock
on a takeover and that the press conference would be a mere
formality, one local bank analyst said.
   But Iversen said Monday that he and his NCNB advance team had
heard no such rumors. When the press conference site shifted to
Washington, D.C., near-panic set in.
   ``It wasn't a done deal as far as we were concerned,'' Iversen
said. ``We were on pins and needles.''
   Iversen and others breathed a collective sigh of relief when
news came that the North Carolina bank holding company had indeed
won the bidding, conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   ``We had done ads for newspapers and radio, tons of posters and
customer letters,'' he said. ``If the deal hadn't been done, we
wouldn't have been able to use that for anything but scrap paper.''
   All of the posters, letters and advertising was secretly
produced in North Carolina and then quietly shipped to Dallas on
Thursday via Federal Express.
   There was so much material that NCNB had to rent a separate
hotel room just to store it, Iversen said.
   The North Carolina delegation will stay on for short time
longer, officials said. Advance team members will be stationed at
each of the First RepublicBank offices throughout Texas.
   ``They'll be there to reassure customers,'' Iversen explained.
``Then after one week, we'll go away.''
   First RepublicBank's 40 Texas banks were turned over to NCNB on
Friday.
   The following day, First RepublicBank and IFRB Corp., its wholly
owned subsidiary and intermediate holding company formed in last
year's merger with InterFirst Corp., filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   In light of the bankruptcy filings, the New York Stock Exchange
on Monday suspended trading in First RepublicBank's stock.
   First RepublicBank retains a single bank in Delaware and certain
subsidiaries engaged in non-banking activities, the bank said in a
statement.

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When NCNB Corp. came to the rescue of
ailing First RepublicBank of Dallas, it was doing what came
naturally _ aggressively expanding into new markets.
   ``The single biggest strength of this company is we have a `do
business' attitude,'' NCNB vice president William P. Middlemas said
Monday. ``We try to do something with every deal that comes in.
Maybe we don't do it as it's presented, but we try to do it.
   ``It's part of our culture _ our strength,'' he added. ``We're
quite prepared to go there (Texas) and do business.''
   As he spoke, some 250 NCNB managers were in Texas taking control
of the 41 banks that made up the insolvent First RepublicBank
Corp., now operating as NCNB Texas National Bank.
   On Friday, NCNB _ currently the nation's 18th largest bank with
$28.6 billion in assets _ was selected to acquire the financially
ailing Texas bank in what has been described as the largest bank
rescue in U.S. history.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it would spend up to $4
billion to bail out First Republic but expects to recoup a large
portion of those losses.
   North Carolina National Bank was created in 1960 when American
Commercial Bank of Charlotte and Security National Bank of
Greensboro merged.
   The new bank had $480 million in assets, 1,300 employees and 40
offices in 20 North Carolina cities and towns.
   In the next two decades, NCNB grew rapidly through mergers with
existing banks and by opening new offices. It also gained a
national reputation for aggressively pursuing new markets.
   In 1981, NCNB purchased First National Bank of Lake City, Fla.
   Federal law had barred a bank from operating in more than one
state, but the merger was approved by the Federal Reserve Board
because NCNB had owned a trust company in Florida since 1972,
before the state enacted laws prohibiting the takeover by
out-of-state companies.
   Observers say NCNB's venture into Florida sparked a five-year
buying spree that tripled it's assets to nearly $29 billion.
   Once allowed to capitalize on opportunities in other states,
NCNB bought up banks in Florida, Tennessee, Georgia and South
Carolina.
   Former NCNB Corp. President William Dougherty said the latest
move reflected the same strategy that opened the door to interstate
banking seven years earlier. ``If we hadn't been aggressively
interested in Florida, we wouldn't have ever gotten in,'' he said.
   Middlemas, who is in charge of the company's North Carolina
banking group, said the Texas deal ``is a big step in ensuring
NCNB's survival in banking circles for a long time. Size is
important.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago & North Western Transportation Co. issued
a compromise offer Monday in an effort to avert a strike by the
United Transportation Union that could affect 41,000 commuters and
disrupt freight deliveries in several Farm Belt states.
   Separately, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said he planned to
introduce legislation to speedily extend a cooling-off period in
the labor dispute for 36 days, which would postpone any strike
action.
   The railroad offered to accept a recommendation by a
presidential emergency panel to eliminate 700 brakemen's jobs,
instead of the 1,150 cuts C&NW had previously said were needed.
   But United Transportation Union general counsel Robert Hart said
the union was not impressed by the offer. ``That won't settle it,''
Hart said.
   C&NW spokesman James Foote said the railroad ``made a
concessionary offer to the union to try and settle this dispute.''
   But he acknowledged the railroad is ``not very hopeful'' the
union will accept the offer to avert the strike, scheduled to begin
Thursday.
   The recommendation initially came from the Presidential
Emergency Board in July, which President Reagan appointed in April
in an effort to solve the longstanding dispute, Foote said.
   Until Monday's compromise offer, C&NW had said it wanted to save
$51 million a year by cutting most of its train crews from four to
two people, eliminating what it considers unnecessary brakemen's
jobs and leaving an engineer and conductor on board.
   The union has considered that move unacceptable.
   The presidential panel recommended that all the railroad's
freight trains be operated with three brakemen instead of four,
that only two brakemen be used on certain nonstop freight trains,
Foote said.
   The strike would affect commuters in a six-county area around
Chicago for whom C&NW provides service through an agreement with
Metra, a suburban commuter rail service. It would also affect
freight service in several Midwestern states.
   However, neither side can act until a cooling-off period ordered
by Reagan ends at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4.
   Hart said Monday's move by the C&NW was intended to persuade
Congress not to extend the cooling-off period.
   ``C&NW doesn't want'' the strike to be postponed, he said.
``They want it to come to a head.
   ``All the purpose of this statement is to persuade Congress not
to take any action,'' Hart said.
   But in Washington, Simon spokesman David Carle said an extension
of the cooling-off period would give both sides ``breathing room''
to come up with a solution on their own.
   He said Simon would introduce the bill under a ``fast-track''
procedure that would allow a Senate vote Tuesday, and would work
with several House members who could get it through that chamber
the next day.

<TEXT>
   Shipments from the steel service center
industry, which includes carbon industrial steel products and
stainless steel, should increase by 3 percent this year, a trade
association forecast said Monday.
   Such an increase would bring total U.S. shipments for the $24
billion steel service center industry to a record 23.7 million
tons, the Steel Service Center Institute said.
   `We had a record first quarter and a solid second quarter,
pushing first-half shipments 5 percent ahead of last year's record
pace,'' said Andrew G. Sharkey, president of the institute, which
represents the interests of 85 percent of the steel service center
industry.
   According to Sharkey, ``We anticipate that the third and fourth
quarters will be strong, although unable to match 1987's
exceptionally strong second half. As such, the overall gain for the
year will be about 3 percent, versus the 5 percent gain through the
first six months.''

<HEAD>Butcher & Singer Being Sold to Wheat, First Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Butcher & Singer, Philadelphia's largest
independent brokerage firm, is being acquired by Wheat, First
Securities of Richmond, Va., the two companies announced Monday.
   The terms were not disclosed.
   The merger is the culmination of talks that began two months ago
and were prompted partly by Butcher & Singer's interest in Wheat's
computer operations, said John L. McElroy Jr., chairman and chief
executive of Wheat, First Securities.
   McBee Butcher, chairman and chief executive of Butcher & Singer,
which has roots going back to the American Revolution, said both
parties would like to have the merger completed by the end of
September.
   ``I think that everyone is enthusiastic about it because it
makes you much more of a contender when you're this size,'' Butcher
said.
   Butcher also said the privately-held firm was being sold to cut
costs and to boost efficiencies. The merger will eliminate about
100 of the firm's 500 jobs in Philadelphia, he said.
   Butcher and other executives from the firm will become officers
of WFS Financial, the Richmond-based parent of Wheat, First
Securities. However, top levels of management will be filled by
Wheat executives.
   Although the headquarters will remain in Richmond, both Butcher
and Wheat will maintain separate brokerage offices and none will
close.
   Butcher said Wheat interests would own a majority of the
combined companies. He also said Johannes Fuerst von Thurn und
Taxis, a West German prince who bought one-third interest in
Butcher last December, will be a minority owner in WFS.
   Under the terms of the arrangement, the companies will form WBF
Securities Inc., a financial services and investment banking
holding company with two separate divisions. The company will have
capital of $56 million, about $15 million contributed by Butcher &
Singer. WBF will be owned by the existing WSF Financial.
   The company will have about 2,000 employees, including 750
investment brokers in 92 locations from Massachusetts to South
Carolina.

<HEAD>USG Corporation Announces Plans To Sell Metal Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   USG Corp. said Monday it plans to sell four
construction metal and steel framing facilities to help pay off
debt incurred in its recapitalization.
   The plants to be sold are in Boonton, N.J.; Morrow, Ga.;
Mansfield, Tex.; and Franklin Park, Ill., Chicago-based USG said in
a statement.
   The facilities employ about 400 people and generate more than
$100 million in annual sales, the statement read.
   USG also will relocate a Torrance, Calif., facility as part of
the plan.
   The planned sale is part of USG's recapitalization and
restructuring, in which the corporation is focusing its resources
on its core businesses, such as gypsum and gypsum-related products.
