   Melvin Leroy Blizzard Sr. arrived at the
polls on Election Day to find election officials thought he had
departed _ permanently.
   The records at Blizzard's polling place at the Deer Park United
Methodist Church listed the 58-year-old farmer as dead.
   ``I'm deceased,'' he said. ``They buried me back in July. Can you
beat that?''
   Blizzard said he always votes and was particularly anxious to do
so Tuesday to vote against a ballot question to retain Maryland's
new law banning the manufacture and sale of some handguns. The
referendum passed.
   So he told poll workers at the church to wait while he went to
the Carroll County Board of Election Supervisors in Westminster, the
county seat.
   ``I was mad,'' Blizzard said. ``I went in there and said, `What
in the world is going on?' I preached them a sermon up one way and
down the other.''
   Chief Clerk Pauline Kram said Blizzard's name was mistakenly
removed from the rolls when another Melvin Leroy Blizzard died last
summer. She issued him a temporary voting card.
   The living Blizzard, in fact, knew the deceased Blizzard.
   He said about 25 people called him after the other Blizzard's
obituary appeared, and he still occasionally meets acquaintances who
are surprised to find him alive.

<TEXT>
   E.D. Hirsch, the University of Virginia English
professor who was about as famous as any other UVA English professor
until rocketing onto best-seller lists with his book, ``Cultural
Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know,'' is anxious these days
to avoid the charge of arrogance.
   That may be a bit harder now with the publication of his
similarly titled sequel, ``The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy: What
Every American Needs to Know'' (Houghton Mifflin, $19.95),
co-written by University of Virginia history professor Joseph F.
Kett, and James Trefil, a physics professor at George Mason
University.
   The book contains 23 chapters detailing what these scholars
believe literate Americans should know about such subjects as the
Bible, world and U.S. history, geography, the arts, science,
economics, proverbs and idioms.
   Hirsch's dictionary, however, more aptly resembles a patent drug
whose manufacturer forgot to include the warning labels.
   The subtitle, ``What Every American Needs to Know,'' might
logically lead one to suppose that this dictionary contains what one
ought to know. But Hirsch bridles at the suggestion that he would
ever be so arrogant, or as he puts it, ``prescriptive.''
   He makes a different claim for his dictionary _ more modest in
his view. The dictionary lays out, he says, the nation's common
parlance, what all of us need to know to communicate with each other
despite our ethnic or regional differences.
   ``I'm interested in what brings us together as strangers,'' he
said in a recent conversation.
   In arriving at which entries were ``common'' to Americans and
thus belonged in his dictionary, Hirsch said he and his academic
colleagues first consulted the front pages of such leading news
publications as The New York Times and The Washington Post for terms
and concepts in common usage. From there, they canvassed and quizzed
lawyers, teachers and others generally considered literate to see
which items ought to be included in the dictionary.
   The results of this winnowing process sometimes range from the
merely idiosyncratic to a sad commentary on what we Americans
consider our cultural domain.
   It includes, for example, the term ``meliorism,'' meaning a
belief that things are getting better. Knowing that may make you a
hit at a political science convention, but even the most literate of
us will probably cruise happily through life without ever uttering
that word.
   The dictionary also manages to present two sections on world
history nearly free of any suggestion that anything notable ever
occurred south of the Equator. Hirsch insisted that including such
information in this book so prescriptively titled ``What Americans
Need to Know'' would have been too ``prescriptive.''
   That half of the world does, however, get mentioned in the world
geography section.
   So what are we to make of this dictionary? It's necessary to
refer to the book's brief introduction and, more importantly, to the
earlier work that started it all.
   In April 1987, Hirsch flew to San Francisco to introduce his
original book, ``Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to
Know,'' to a gathering of education writers. The work featured an
audacious, 4,500-item list consisting of what he believed all
Americans should know to be considered ``culturally literate'': from
Star Wars to the Stamp Act, nouveau riche to Neanderthal man, Old
King Cole to Omar Khayyam.
   His message was clear, and it struck a chord with the book-buying
public: U.S. schools, he argued, are stressing mere mechanical
skills over content, leaving millions of Americans ignorant of the
common knowledge that make up our culture.
   To everyone's surprise, this ``where's the beef''-type challenge
to the education establishment turned this scholarly book into a
publishing sensation.
   His first book and, no doubt, his new dictionary, will continue
to be a rallying point for those who believe schools have strayed
from their central mission of teaching youngsters what the American
heritage is all about.
   We ought to be able to agree, Hirsch insists, on a body of shared
knowledge that all Americans should know. More to the point, we must
insist that schools teach it.
   ``Schools ought to decide on goals,'' he said in the interview.
``Those goals should be content goals, and not just skills goals.
They should know what kids should know at the end of first grade, or
second grade. That's completely foreign now.''
   Hirsch still receives numerous letters from teachers and others
who applaud his message. But he's also taken his share of criticism.
   The left has condemned him for omitting references to minority
groups and non-western cultures. Conservatives have said his
literacy list lets youngsters off too easily by reducing American
culture to slogans, buzzwords and maxims.
   Hirsch strongly defends the idea of listing such items: ``You
can't have a concrete proposal without a list. Not to make a list is
to be evasive.''
   But in light of all this, Hirsch's claim that his dictionary
merely describes what Americans know, rather than what they ought
to, sounds disingenuous.
   How does one account, for example, for the nearly complete
omission of the pervasive influence of television on American
culture? It might perhaps be better if young and old minds weren't
awash with ``I Love Lucy'' and J.R. Ewing, but leaving them out of
this dictionary won't make it so.
   More fundamentally, it's not at all clear that Hirsch is correct
in his central contention that there exists a ``consensus culture''
awaiting scholarly discovery, a common American cultural language
that can be distilled free of transient regional or ethnic
impurities.
   Even less clear is that any good would result from finding it,
had he succeeded in doing so.

<TEXT>
   A woman who allegedly made up to 100,000 crank calls
to her former husband since 1986 has been arrested near Tokyo, local
police said today.
   Toyoko Terahashi, 26, allegedly called her former husband at his
office, alternately yelling into the phone or saying nothing before
hanging up, according to Kawasaki Police Department spokesman
Hiroshi Katsutani.
   Katsutani said the calls began three months after the couple were
divorced in January 1986 and numbered up to 200 a day. The couple
married in May 1985.
   According to police, Ms. Terahashi's husband left her and filed
for divorce after being subjected to domestic violence. Ms.
Terahashi then began telephoning the man's office and homes of over
20 of his coworkers in an effort to find out where he was living.
   The president of the company where the man is employed filed a
complaint with the police, who found that during their
investigation, from Sept. 3 to Oct. 19, the woman called the company
753 times.
   The woman allegedly told police she initially made the calls
because she wanted to see her former husband and thought the company
was hiding him from her. Later, however, the calls were ``simply out
of spite,'' Katsutani said.
   He said that when investigators arrived at her home Thursday to
arrest her, she was yelling ``You idiot!'' into the phone.
   Ms. Terahashi confessed her monthly phone bill was over 40,000
yen ($320), and at times reached half her monthly salary, according
to the spokesman.
   Ms. Terahashi was arrested for harrassing the company and could
face up to 3 years in jail or a fine of up to 200,000 yen ($1,500).

<DATELINE>MALE, Maldives (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abrupt burst of violence has left deep
scars in this otherwise peaceful paradise, a land where only two
murders have been reported this century.
   The Maldives, a group of about 2,000 coral islands in the Indian
Ocean, is better known for its picture-postcard beaches and secluded
resorts than for foreign mercenaries battling soldiers in the
streets.
   But the islands' image underwent a brutal overhaul on Nov. 3,
when hired gunmen from Sri Lanka tried unsuccessfully to overthrow
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.
   ``Maldives has been catapulted into the 20th century,'' said A.K.
Banerjee, India's top diplomat on the islands.
   The attempt to oust Gayoom was thwarted by the arrival of Indian
paratroopers, but at least a dozen people were killed in Male, the
capital, and at least six more died on a ship hijacked by escaping
mercenaries.
   The Indian paratroopers have begun withdrawing from the country
after their quick success but some remain as a token force,
controlling the jetty on Male and the international airport on
nearby Hulule island.
   A week after the fighting, soldiers of the Maldivian National
Security Service, the country's 1,200-man militia, continue to
patrol the narrow, unpaved streets of Male island.
   The militia's coast guard speedboats constantly monitor movements
off anchored ships.
   Gayoom lives under heavy guard at the Security Service
headquarters, and civilians are barred from moving in front of the
three-story white building.
   Before the coup attempt, Gayoom's chauffeur-driven car moved
freely along the streets of the capital without bodyguards, said a
resident who spoke on condition of anonymity. Now he is accompanied
by bodyguards, and the streets are cleared in advance.
   The militia headquarters bore the brunt of the mercenaries'
attacks. The building's front is chipped by bullets, windows are
shattered and a huge hole was knocked into its 30-foot boundary wall
by a rocket-propelled grenade.
   ``The effect of the coup will last,'' said Sajida Mohammed, a
19-year-old girl who said she'd never seen a dead person until the
fighting. She lives down the street from the presidental palace and
said fighting raged outside her one-story brick house for more than
10 hours.
   The people of Male, most government employees or fishermen,
gathered to stare at the Indian paratroopers in red berets,
camouflage uniforms and black army boots.
   ``They are not hostile, but you can sense their disapproval,''
said an Indian major. ``I think they don't like violence.''
   Ismail Mohammad, a law student, said he could find records of
only two murders in the islands in this century. ``One was by a West
German tourist who killed his girlfriend on a resort,'' he said. ``I
don't remember the other but know that a fisherman was killed.''
   The German was convicted a few years ago and banished to a remote
island where he married a Maldivian woman.
   Banishment has been the customary punishment for crimes, but the
mercenaries could face the death sentence, Gayoom told a news
conference this week.
   Tourism brings in about $10.5 million a year in the
Maldives.About 120,000 tourists, mostly from Western Europe and
Japan, visit the islands annually.
   Gayoom was unconcerned about the long-term effects of the coup.
Asked if the trouble could affect tourism, the islands' largest
industry after fishing, he said: ``It could get better after the
exposure we have received in the international press.''
   Sources in the Maldivian government, however, said the security
of the islands would now be a priority.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Gayoom
would discuss the situation with foreign delegations visiting Male
on Friday for the ceremony installing him as president for a third
five-year term.
   Delegations from the United States, India and Sri Lanka are to
attend, they said.
   Gayoom was re-elected Sept. 23. As is customary in the Maldives,
a former hereditary sultanate that became independent from Britain
in 1965, he was the only candidate and the ballot was a yes-or-no
vote. Ninety-five percent of the ballots said ``yes.''

<DATELINE>STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lament by Connecticut's poet laureate
about his village grocery store may have lost the store.
   ``November Ode,'' a poem by James Merrill, winner of the Pulitzer
Prize, has won him some admirers in the old center of this eastern
Connecticut community, but also the animosity of the grocer and
others who found his portrayal unfair.
   Merrill said his work was, in many ways, a generalized commentary
on how community life everywhere has declined with the disappearance
of small neighborhood stores and shops.
   While several people called him to say how the poem ``expressed
their own feelings'' about life in Stonington, Merrill said the
controversy has left him ``wondering if I shouldn't go back to
incomprehensibility, which I have been accused of.''
   To those who live in Stonington borough, which has fewer than
3,000 residents, there is no mistaking the ``dear dim local
grocery'' mentioned unflatteringly in the poem. It is Roland's
Market, the borough's last grocery.
   There are also other references to life in the borough, which was
established in 1752 and is part of the town. Once a fishing village
and major port, its late 18th- and early 19th-century homes and
shops have been rehabilitated and there are a number of antique
stores for visitors.
   Ronald Albamonti, 39, is the first to admit that life is changing
in the borough, and that at the market, ``things just haven't been
the same'' since his father, Roland, died last year and he took
over. But he said he was deeply hurt by Merrill's poem, which he
views as a personal attack.
   The poem reads, in part:
   ``The son picked to succeed him never lived up to the
   seigneurial old man. Yet his clientele
   kept brightly toeing the line of least
   resistance, taking
   with a grain of salt (Aisle 3) all talk of heavy drugs
   and light women, closing Republican eyes
   to dead mouse and decimated shelves,
   the padded statement ...''
   With three large supermarkets within 12 miles of the borough,
Albamonti said he decided to make Roland's more like a deli than a
full-service grocery.
   The poem was the final straw for Albamonti. Gauging that the
public generally shared the sentiments expressed by Merrill,
Albamonti said he reached a tenative agreement this week to sell the
business and the property.
   If the store is closed and the two-story building used for
another purpose, Merrill's poem, written a year ago and published
last month in The New York Review of Books, will have proven itself
to be prophetic:
   ``Plainer than day was how, next summer, this prime
   square footage would be developed in the usual way.''
   Merrill, who lives only two blocks from Roland's Market but
hasn't been back to the store since the poem controversy erupted,
moved to Stonington from New York City in the 1950s, partly to be
part of a small community.
   At Keane's newstand a block from Roland's Market, Francis Keane,
78, who has been selling newspapers in the borough for 50 years,
said some customers thought Merrill had been unfair in his criticism
of Ronald Albamonti. At the same time, he said he agreed Merrill was
right when he spoke of the decline of community life.
   ``It was a reflection of what is happening in small towns. It is
a different environment now. Years ago everybody was more friendly
and stayed in town. Now they come here just to sleep and eat and
then go off in their cars to work,'' he said.

   A federal judge who aroused controversy last
summer by ordering a female attorney to use her husband's last name
in his courtroom says he is stepping down as an active trial judge.
   ``I'm 73 years old and I think it's about time I ease up my trial
schedule,'' said U.S. District Judge Hubert Teitelbaum, who's been a
federal judge since 1971.
   Teitelbaum said Thursday his decision had nothing to do with his
order last July forbidding attorney Barbara Wolvovitz to use her
maiden name during a civil trial in his courtroom.
   ``I conferred with the court and did this on my own volition and
not because of anything connected with Ms. Wolvovitz,'' he said.
   The judge had threatened to jail Ms. Wolvovitz for refusing his
order. He later apologized and rescinded his order after outraged
women's groups sought his resignation.
   The controversy also helped prompt an investigation by the local
bar association into sexism in the courtroom.
   Teitelbaum said he notified Chief U.S. District Judge Maurice
Cohill three weeks ago that he was stepping down as an active trial
judge and transferring most of his cases to other judges.
   Teitelbaum said he would retain his courtroom and hear social
security cases and routine constitutional appeals in criminal cases.

<HEAD>Mexican Policeman Convicted In Camarena Murder Gets 15 More Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Mexican policeman sentenced to 240
years in prison for a drug agent's murder has been given another 15
years for conspiring to kill a fictitious customs agent.
   U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer pronounced sentence on Raul
Lopez Alvarez, 29, and two co-defendants Thursday, but not without
criticizing the prosecution for a case that ``pushes the conspiracy
theory to its ultimate.''
   She imposed sentences far lower than what prosecutors had
recommended.
   Lopez, once a member of the Guadalajara police homicide squad,
was convicted last month along with two Mexican drug traffickers in
the 1985 murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent
Enrique Camarena.
   Before that trial began, Lopez was convicted in the conspiracy
case that stemmed from a government sting operation tied to the
Camarena investigation.
   An undercover agent posing as a drug dealer lured Lopez to the
United States, ostensibly to obtain information for the Camarena
probe, then conducted lengthy videotaped conversations with him.
   The tapes were the key government evidence in both trials. During
the talks, Lopez discussed details of Camarena's torture murder and
agreed to murder a customs agent at the request of the man he
thought was a drug dealer.
   According to evidence at the trial, Lopez subsequently recruited
Fabian Jiminez Martinez, 23, and Carlos Quintero Maldonado, 26, who
traveled with him from Mexico to participate in the planned
kidnapping, torture and murder of a customs agent invented by the
government.
   ``By the sound of it, it is hard to imagine a more serious
crime,'' said the judge. But she noted ``there is no evidence that
any official of the United States was in any danger at all.''
   As a result, she said, she could not impose the 30- to 40-year
sentences sought by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmy Gurule.
   She ordered Lopez' 15-year sentence to run concurrently with the
240 years he was sentenced to in the Camarena case.
   Jimenez and Quintero were sentenced to 10 years each and will be
eligible for parole after serving a third of their sentences.

   George Bush will bring to the White House a
more pragmatic, less ideological brand of leadership than Ronald
Reagan and almost assuredly will get more involved in the day-to-day
operation of the presidency, political analysts predict.
   Reagan saw the presidency as a pulpit for setting a national
agenda. Bush seems more interested in the mechanics of governing and
in management.
   It was clear on the day Reagan was elected what he would do:
freeze government hiring, cut taxes and spending and build up the
Pentagon.
   Bush, on the morning after he was elected, said he would use the
73-day transition to the presidency to set the priorities for his
administration.
   While the policies of Reagan and Bush administrations may not
vary much, there will be a different tone in the White House come
Jan. 20.
   Bush, who promises a kinder and gentler nation, says the
stillness of the White House will be broken by the sound of 10
grandchildren laughing and crying.
   The jelly bean jars in the Reagan White House probably will be
replaced with stacks of cracklin' pork rinds, Bush's favorite snack.
   Reagan's favorite magazine was ``Human Events,'' a conservative
political journal. Bush's favorite is ``Bassmaster,'' a fishing
journal.
   Bush, 64, is left-handed. He likes country music, vodka martinis
and Mexican food. He jogs several times a week, covering two miles
in about 18 minutes.
   For fun, he races his Cigarette boat off the chilly waters of
Maine. He's an avid tennis player and fisherman and also likes to
play horseshoes.
   An Episcopalian, he attends church regularly with his wife,
Barbara. They've been married 43 years. They have five children, all
adults now, and dote on their 10 grandchildren.
   Bush will take over from a popular president who charmed the
nation with his easy-going manner, wit and polished communications
skills.
   Bush readily acknowledges he's different.
   ``I may not be the most eloquent, but I learned early that
eloquence won't draw oil from the ground,'' Bush said last summer.
``I may sometimes be a little awkward but there's nothing
self-conscious in my love of country. I am a quiet man but I hear
the quiet people others don't.''
   On another occasion, he said, ``My leadership might not be the
most charismatic but I'm not sure that we need a lot of razzle
dazzle. There's probably enough drama in the world already.''
   Conservatives are worried that Bush, although he took a hard line
during his presidential campaign, will turn into a moderate in the
White House.
   Indeed, his political leanings have drifted over the years. Bush
was a Goldwater Republican in 1966 when he was first elected to
Congress, a Rockefeller Republican in 1980 when he ran for president
and has been a Reagan Republican ever since.
   ``I suspect that George Bush will want a staff that includes sort
of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around
him,'' said Republican consultant David Keene, who once worked for
Bush.
   ``The difference between the styles of (Reagan and Bush) is that
Bush is out of an intellectual and political tradition in which the
emphasis is on finding the right people in public service, seeking
their advice and believing that goals come out of having the right
people in the right places,'' said Keene.
   As a onetime envoy to China and the United Nations, as well as
chief of the CIA, Bush has a solid foundation in foreign policy.
Reagan in his first year in office practically ignored foreign
policy, devoting his attention to budget and tax cuts. Bush says he
wants a NATO summit conference and an early meeting with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow in governmental studies at the
Brookings Institution, said that Reagan ``is the most hands-off
manager of the modern presidency. I suspect that George Bush will be
not nearly as hands off. ...''
   Echoing that theme, Lyn Nofziger, who was Reagan's first
political director in the White House, said Bush would be ``probably
more involved in the presidency and the day-to-day operations (but)
probably not a hell of a lot more. He's not a Jimmy Carter or
Michael Dukakis.'' Both Carter and Dukakis are known for their
attention to detail.
   Hess said Bush ``certainly seems to share Reagan's disdain for
the press. He, too, doesn't see being too close to the press as
being in his interest.''
   Though Bush has promised to stay the course set by Reagan, Hess
said ``each president wants to do things differently than the person
he succeeds.''
   ``What kind of president he'll be will depend largely on things
that happen in the next four years that are largely out of his
control _ whether the Iranians take over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
or something like that,'' Hess said. ``There are going to be some
things that happen in the next four years in which the mettle of the
man will have to be assessed.''
   On that very point, Bush told an audience recently that the Oval
Office was a place for ``the moments that cut through the expected
and the everyday and force us, through action, to define ourselves.''
   ``I don't know what the cutting moments will be for the next
president,'' Bush said. ``But I know they'll come. And I know I'm
ready.''

   After a presidential election, the winner gets
to live in the White House. The loser doesn't, but life goes on _
even political life.
   ``I'll be working with the people of Massachusetts,'' said
Michael Dukakis, who would have preferred to work with the people of
the whole country. He is one of the majority of losers in recent
years who either had a political home to return to or who wasted no
time finding another one.
   Quick now, name the losers of presidential campaigns in the last
40 years and their fate after failing to get the big prize.
   For the record, they were Republican Thomas E. Dewey in 1948;
Democrat Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and 1956; Republican Richard Nixon
in 1960; Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964; Democrat Hubert
Humphrey in 1968; Democrat George McGovern in 1972; Republican
Gerald Ford in 1976; Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980, and Democrat
Walter Mondale in 1984.
   With the exception of Ford and Carter, who occupy a special place
because they lost after being in the White House, and Mondale, each
of the losers continued on in public service. Mondale may yet run
for the Senate again in 1990.
   Harry Truman, who chose not to run for a second elected term,
once described the fate that awaits former presidents.
   ``Most people never stop to think about what happens to a man who
has been president of the United States,'' he wrote in ``Mr.
Citizen.'' ``The day he is elected president he suddenly finds
himself at the top of the world, where he sits for a while, holding
the destinies of millions in his hands, making decisions that change
the course of history, conferring with rulers and the leaders of
nations.
   ``Then just as suddenly he is again at the level of John Jones,
who lives next door.''
   Carter became the man next door by moving back to Plains, Ga.,
but not as a peanut farmer. Instead, he took up woodworking,
traveling, meeting with world leaders, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro,
becoming a visiting professor at Emory University and devoting time
to the Carter Presidential Center where he hosts international
conferences.
   Ford went straight from the White House onto the golf course _ he
played in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am Tournament the day after Carter's
inauguration _ and has lived the easy-going life ever since.
   He also turned into a one-man corporation, lending his name to
boards of directors, lecturing for fees of $15,000 and more,
entering into a partnership to buy radio stations and receiving $1
million for his memoirs.
   Ford opposed Ronald Reagan's 1980 bid for election and encouraged
other challengers, toyed for a time with entering the race himself,
and for one day at the Republican convention looked as if he might
be Reagan's choice for vice president.
   Mondale's disappearance from the spotlight has been so complete
that Democrats rarely mention him.
   ``Oh, I miss it a little,'' he said in Atlanta during the
Democratic National Convention, but added: ``You know, I had my say,
and I don't miss the 18-hour days.''
   Mondale practices law in Washington and Minneapolis and there's
been some talk _ not from him _ that he may try to reclaim his
Senate seat from Minnesota in 1990.
   The other presidential losers took their lumps and started anew.
   After his second consecutive defeat for president, in 1948, Dewey
said,``I have been graduated at a comparatively early age to the
role of elder statesman, which someone has aptly defined as a
politician who is no longer a candidate for any office.''
   A year later he wrote a friend: ``Nothing could arise now or in
the future that would lead me to be the nominee of our party in
1952. My decision on this matter is as certain and final as death
and the staggering New Deal taxes.''
   After more such disclaimers, he ran in 1950 for his third term as
governor of New York and won. Dewey died in 1971.
   Stevenson, the eloquent but reluctant Democratic candidate in
1952 and 1956, was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to be U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, a post he held until his death in
1965.
   When he lost the second time, Stevenson recalled the Lincoln line
that he felt like a little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark:
``Too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh.''
   After losing to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon returned to California to
practice law and pressures began to build on him to run for governor
in 1962.
   ``The real problem was that I had no great desire to be governor
of California,'' he wrote of his defeat in that race. And yet, he
was bitter enough about losing that he snarled at reporters: ``You
won't have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is
my last press conference.''
   It wasn't, of course, and Nixon spent the next six years earning
the Republican chips that he would cash in to be elected president
in 1968.
   Goldwater cooled his political heels for four years after his
loss to Lyndon Johnson, then was re-elected to the Senate without
the seniority he had built up in the previous two terms.
   He remained the voice of conservatives, once characterizing a
Carter presidential announcement of plans for recognition of China
as ``10 minutes that lived in infamy.''
   Humphrey, who had been vice president for four years when he lost
to Nixon in 1968, spent a little while as a professor at Macalester
College and the University of Minnesota, then won back his Senate
seat in 1970. He ran again for the Democratic nomination in 1972 but
withdrew in the face of overwhelming odds at the party's convention.
He died of cancer in 1978.
   McGovern, the South Dakota senator who won that nomination,
stayed in the Senate until 1980 when he lost his seat. He made a
third try for the presidency in 1984 in a primary campaign that
lasted less than six months before he dropped out.
   There is a reward for loyal service, even for candidates who lose.
   In 1970, Nixon persuaded a millionaire, two-time Houston
congressman to give up his safe seat to run for the Senate against
businessman Lloyd Bentsen. The congressman lost.
   But Nixon didn't leave the loser out in the cold. A month after
the election, Nixon personally announced that the defeated
congressman would be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
   ``It's a great and awesome responsibility,'' said the new
ambassador, George Bush. ``I consider myself a very lucky guy.''

   Raymond Thompson, mayor of this southern
Minnesota town for more than a dozen years, spent the weeks before
the Tuesday election doing what he always does when his term nears
its end: nothing.
   As usual, he didn't file for re-election, he didn't campaign and
he didn't even bother to find out who won. When he got home about
9:30 p.m. from a deer hunting trip to northern Minnesota, he went to
bed.
   As usual, he won.
   City Clerk Shirley Wiles called first thing Wednesday to tell
Thompson he had been swept back into office with a landslide 111
write-in votes. That's in a town with 310 residents, ``including
people and dogs,'' Thompson said.
   The mayor, who owns Thompson Livestock in Racine, ran and was
elected for office once many years ago. After that, he figured if
the people wanted him, they could write him in. If someone else
wants the job, according to his philosophy, let that person have it.
   But someone else has not come forward, so Thompson keeps getting
elected. By his account, he has been mayor for either six or seven
two-year terms.
   Not running has its merits, Thompson said.
   ``I don't promise them (anything), so I don't have to fulfill''
anything, he said.
   And election night party expenses are kept to a minimum.
   ``You don't have a celebration when you're not running,'' he said.
   Now that he's mayor again, Thompson said he plans to do what he's
done before in the job, which pays him $750 a year. He'll keep the
city council ``on the straight and narrow.''

<HEAD>Nuclear-Powered, Dual-Chamber Pacemaker More Comfortable, Lasts
Longer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELEN J. SIMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors say a new nuclear powered,
dual-chamber pacemaker implanted in a patient for the first time is
more comfortable than its predecessor and can last twice as long as
those currently in use.
   John Sniffen, 47, of Clifton became the first person in the world
to use the device, according to Newark's Beth Israel Medical Center,
where the 90-minute operation was performed Tuesday.
   The new pacemaker, powered by plutonium, lasts from 20 to 40
years, while a similar lithium battery-powered dual-chamber
pacemaker developed in 1974 must be replaced every five to eight
years, said Dr. Victor Parsonnet, who performed the operation.
   Though nuclear pacemakers have been available for 15 years, they
are of the single-chamber design, which is less comfortable than the
dual-chamber design that imitates the heart's two-step rhythm,
Parsonnet said Thursday at a news conference.
   When the heart beats, its lower part squeezes blood into the
upper chamber, where a second squeeze sends the blood into the rest
of the body.
   The new device, called a Pulsar-N1, alternately jolts the two
chambers with electrical impulses, adapting to the patient's rate of
activity, Parsonnet said.
   Single-chamber nuclear pacemakers, which last about 16 years,
only stimulate the lower chamber of the heart and their action can
be felt by the patient, he said.
   Sniffen, who was listed in good condition, told reporters he felt
``happy to be alive and to be the first recipient of this newest
generation of pacemakers.''
   Wearing a white daisy in his bathrobe lapel, he said that the
single-chamber, nuclear-powered pacemaker he received in 1975 made
him feel ``jolts every once in a while and (I) was totally aware of
it.''
   ``Now I feel good. A little weak from the operation, but other
than that, it's real nice,'' he said.
   Sniffen, a photocopying and facsimile machine salesman, suffers
from intermittent heart block, which makes the heart stop
occasionally and can cause fainting.
   The Pulsar-N1, an oblong device about 2{ inches wide and an inch
thick, is placed between the skin and the muscle of the chest wall.
Two wires are threaded through a vein to the heart, where they are
attached to the upper and lower chambers.
   Parsonnet said that with its greater longevity, the new device
can eliminate the need for replacement operations, reducing the
physical and emotional stress on the patient and saving money.
   ``Theoretically, this pacemaker will last a lifetime,'' said
Parsonnet, who helped implant the first American-made,
single-chamber nuclear powered pacemaker in 1973.
   Patients also can avoid exposure to the X-rays required to locate
the pacemaker each time it has to be replaced, said David L. Purdy,
president of Biocontrol Technology, the Indiana, Pa., company that
manufactures the device.
   The new pacemaker has its drawbacks, however.
   Hospitals must be licensed to implant the devices and patients
have to be registered with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to use
them, even though experts say they present no radiation danger.
   The device also costs more _ about $6,000 compared with its
$4,500 lithium counterpart. It is also bigger and weighs more.
   ``The major issue is the paperwork and the size,'' Purdy said.

   The nation's energy chief is fending off
complaints that a decision to select Texas from among seven bidding
states as the site for a $4.4 billion super collider atom smasher
was guided more by politics than by science.
   Politicians from some of the losing states _ Illinois, Colorado,
Michigan, Arizona, Tennessee and North Carolina _ called for a
bipartisan review of the selection process.
   ``The Texas decision has a strong smell of White House
politics,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich.
   Riegle and senators from Illinois, Colorado and Arizona sent a
letter Thursday to President Reagan asking that he appoint a
commission to review the site selection, which was done by a special
task force of the Energy Department. The choice of Texas was
announced Thursday by Energy Secretary John Herrington.
   ``If this project is to have the slightest chance of being funded
it is imperative that you demonstrate'' that the site selection was
``based soley on scientific criteria,'' the senators' letter said.
   Herrington insisted that the Texas site, south of Dallas, was
clearly superior to the others.
   ``There was no politics in this,'' he told reporters.
   The seven states had competed intensely for the right to host the
super collider project because of the economic benefits and
scientific prestige associated with it.
   The collider is envisioned as a 53-mile underground ring that
will use 10,000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other at
energy levels 20 times what is possible in today's most powerful
machines. What happens in those collisions is expected to enable
scientists to test the latest theories on the origins of matter.
   Congress has not yet agreed to build the atom smasher, although
it did appropriate $100 million this year for engineering design and
certain research and development items.
   Herrington said the choice of Texas was based on site geology,
regional resources and environmental criteria.
   The 16,000-acre site some 25 miles south of Dallas was the only
one given ratings of ``outstanding'' on the most important
considerations by the 10-member site evaluation task force of senior
civil servants, Herrington said.
   ``The greatest benefit to the most people in the most states is
what we were after. And I think that after you look into this
process, read the decision documents and question us on it, you will
find out that was in fact what happened,'' he said.
   Herrington said he had no knowledge of the task force evaluation
results until last week, and did not tell Reagan and President-elect
George Bush of his decision until Thursday morning.
   Officials of some of the losing states linked Texas' selection to
Tuesday's election of Bush, who has made Texas his adopted home.
   ``I do not believe that the timing of this decision and its
proximity to the election is a coincidence,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon,
D-Ill.
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements, reacting to Herrington's announcement,
alluded to political links.
   ``The icing on the cake is the very special relationship between
Ronald Reagan and Texas,'' he said.
   Herrington said the installation will be named the Ronald Reagan
Center for High-Energy Physics, if it is built.
   Not every loser was ready to blame politics. Sen. Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., said, ``The fact that we went so far in the process is a
tremendous complement to the state.''
   Herrington said the department will offer technical
``debriefings'' to all the losing states on why Texas was chosen.
   The Energy Department estimated the cost to build the collider
and operate it for 25 years at $10.8 billiton.
   The benefits to Texas will be enormous, assuming the project goes
ahead: 3,000 permanent jobs, including 500 annual positions for
visiting scientists; 3,500 construction jobs, an annual operating
budget of $270 million; much prestige and practially no pollution.
   Experts said the importance of the project goes well beyond the
local benefits it promises.
   Dan Green, head of the physics department at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, said selection of a site was
``really a good sign that America wants to support high energy
physics and wants to support basic research and wants to recapture a
position they have been frittering away.''
   Herrington said much of the leadership in high-energy physics was
headed to Western Europe to participate in the existing CERN
accelerator at Berne, Switzerland.
   ``We need to keep those people in the United States,'' he said.

   A seven-alarm fire Thursday night ripped
through a historic hotel that was being torn down, and authorities
said they suspected arson.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   Concord Fire Chief Richard Judkins labeled the fire in the
140-room, wooden Highway Hotel ``extremely suspicious.''
   Judkins said people were seen fleeing the area as the fire broke
out, and he noted that electricity to the hotel had been shut off
since it was sold and closed in September.
   The fire broke out about 8:15 p.m. Judkins said it was under
control by 11 p.m.
   Dozens of people gathered to watch in parking lots of nearby
shopping centers and along Interstate 93, which passes by the front
of the hotel.
   The hotel, built in 1951, was a center for political gatherings
in the lead-off presidential primary state. Among those who slept,
ate and headquartered their campaigns at the Highway Hotel were
President Reagan, former Presidents Kennedy, Nixon and Ford, Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
   The hotel was being demolished to make way for a shopping center.
Its rooms had been gutted and windows removed, but the building
still stood when the fire broke out.

<HEAD>Bush, Reagan Set Wheels in Motion For Transition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan and George Bush set the wheels in
motion for the president-elect's ascent to chief executive as Reagan
left instructions for his Cabinet officers and political appointees
to resign by Inauguration Day and Bush conferred with leaders of his
transition team.
   After a series of meetings Thursday with the president, the
Cabinet and his transition crew, Bush flew to Florida for a four-day
vacation, his first post-election break.
   The president-elect planned to fish and relax in Gulf Stream,
Fla., but he told reporters he also intends to spend time on the
telephone as he assembles his administration.
   Bush and Reagan met with White House chief of staff Kenneth
Duberstein and later attended a Cabinet meeting. The president-elect
also huddled with Craig Fuller and Bob Teeter, leaders of his
transition office.
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle also met with leaders of Bush's
transition team.
   The Bush transition office officially opens for business on
Monday in a rented suite of offices a few blocks from the White
House. But work was already under way as security guards erected
metal detectors and a desk was set up at the entrance where a
volunteer collected resumes from job-seekers.
   The vice president made his first Cabinet appointment on
Wednesday, naming campaign chairman James A. Baker III to be his
secretary of state. He has told reporters he wants to name the
balance of his Cabinet sooner rather than later, but has set no
timetable.
   Reagan and Bush were applauded as they walked together into a
Cabinet meeting. Fitzwater quoted Reagan as saying, ``We don't even
argue over which side of the table to sit on.''
   But for all the friendliness, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Reagan reminded his men, ``We are still in charge
until Jan. 20 and are still responsible for making decisions of the
government.''
   Duberstein told the Cabinet and heads of independent agencies to
be prepared to submit their resignations. ``It is probably fair to
say that all political appointees at all levels should be prepared
to resign or depart on Jan. 20,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``President Reagan of course is free to accept anyone's
resignation at any time and the president-elect would have that
decision to make after the 20th,'' he said. ``There might be cases
where he wouldn't have someone to fill that position, and would want
someone to stay on for awhile,'' he said.
   Bush on Wednesday promised a ``brand new team'' when he takes
office. But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos all have been
mentioned as possible holdover appointments.
   One man viewed as likely to receive a major post in the new
administration, retiring Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, set his
goals high. He told reporters in New Hampshire that he would turn
down offers to be secretary of education or energy, but White House
chief of staff ``isn't on my `no list.''' Sununu, who campaigned
energetically for Bush and was instrumental in his critical victory
in the New Hampshire primary last February, said he hadn't been
offered any post.
   On day two after the election, the rumor mill was working at full
speed.
   The names spit out included former Sen. John Tower of Texas,
former Rep. Jack Edwards of Alabama or former National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft for the Pentagon; defeated Maryland Senate
candidate Alan Keyes, a former diplomat, as a possible ambassador to
the U.N., and defeated Ohio Senate candidate George Voinovich, the
mayor of Cleveland, for housing and urban development.
   Ohio Rep. Bill Gradison's name circulated through the Department
of Health and Human Services as a possible replacement for Otis
Bowen.
   A long list of names made the rounds at the Agriculture
Department, including Clayton Yeutter, currently the U.S. Trade
Representative.

   A former Nicaraguan rebel says there's
no chance that President-elect George Bush will renew U.S. military
aid for the Contras trying to oust the leftist Sandinista government.
   ``I don't see any future'' for military aid to the U.S.-supported
rebels, said Horacio Arce, who himself abandoned rebel ranks in
September under an amnesty declared by the Sandinistas.
   Arce said Thursday that many rebel military leaders feared well
before the election that opposition to Contra aid in the
Democratic-controlled Congress would continue no matter who won
Tuesday's U.S. election.
   Arce, 33, was known as Commander Mercenario among the Contras,
who have waged a civil war to oust the Sandinistas since 1981. He
said he commanded Contra forces along Nicaragua's Atlantic coast and
the northern border with Honduras.
   In another development, an unsigned communique issued late
Thursday in San Jose, the Costa Rican capital, announced the
formation of a new Nicaraguan rebel organization opposed to a truce
between the Contras and Sandinistas.
   The communique said the group, called the Central American
Democratic Revolutionary Alliance, opposed the cease-fire pact it
said was agreed to by ``reactionary and fascist sectors'' of the
Contra leadership last March.
   ``We commit ourselves to bury forever the Sandinista tyranny,''
the communique said.
   Talks on a definitive truce in the civil war broke down in
September, and each side has accused the other of cease-fire
violations.
   A rebel source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
alliance encompassed a faction of rebel fighters unhappy with the
standoff between the Sandinistas and the political leadership of the
Contras' Nicaraguan Resistance organization.
   His comments could not be immediately confirmed with other rebel
officials.
   In July, seven field commanders claiming to represent 2,700
fighters on Nicaragua's southern front along Costa Rica broke from
the resistance after Enrique Bermudez, the rebel military chief, was
elected to the Contra ruling body.
   The seven commanders denounced Bermudez's election as an attempt
by ``the extreme right'' to gain control of the rebel movement.
   U.S. military aid to the rebels expired Feb 29. Contras who fled
to Honduras afterwards are drawing funds from a humanitarian aid
package.
   Arce said he believed 3,000 to 3,500 rebels were in Honduras when
he abandoned the Contra cause in September.
   Bush has indicated resumption of military assistance would be a
high priority of his administration. Wilfredo Montalvan, a member of
the Contras' political directorate, said this week the rebels would
demand an early military aid commitment from the president-elect.
   President Daniel Ortega said ``it wouldn't be strange'' if Bush
requested more military aid for the Contras but renewed his call for
bilateral talks to resolve protracted problems between the two
nations.

   Despite ``deep disappointment'' over
George Bush's victory, the wife of vanquished Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis said the presidential election was not as traumatic
as her husband's loss in his bid to win a second gubernatorial term
in 1978.
   At the time, Kitty Dukakis pronounced the defeat to then-Democrat
Edward King ``a public death.'' But she said in this election she
felt for several weeks prior to Nov. 8 that her husband's candidacy
was likely to fail.
   ``It was unexpected,'' she said of the 1978 defeat. ``This was
not totally unexpected. Although he had a surge at the end, I think
all of us for many weeks and some of us for longer have in our own
way been dealing with the possibility.
   ``I have not cried. ... I think I must have psychologically been
accepting defeat for a while,'' she said Thursday.
   Mrs. Dukakis reflected on the campaign and her husband's
political future in an interview with The Associated Press in their
modest Brookline home, a comfortable duplex building on a quiet
street in this Boston suburb.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 51, said she ``just wouldn't begin to contemplate
the future,'' for her husband. ``Michael is a national figure and
will continue to be and he will continue to speak out on national
issues.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, known for her sometimes fiery temperament, had no
harsh words for the Bush family. She said of Barbara Bush, ``I think
she's a caring person and she'll be a fine first lady.''
   Mrs. Dukakis said she won't miss the Secret Service, the
chauffeur-driven cars and other trappings of power that go with a
presidential campaign. ``I really am very accepting and frankly feel
very positive about having our quiet, normal life back,'' she said.
   Things aren't quite back to normal at the Dukakis family home.
Flower bouquets were arriving in bunches from political well-wishers
and from friends remembering upcoming birthdays. A pile of at least
a dozen of the governor's telegenic, red campaign ties lay on the
floor awaiting the dry cleaner's.
   Saying she would refuse to play Monday morning quarterback, Mrs.
Dukakis did say of her husband's campaign, ``I was hoping he would
fight harder'' in response to what Dukakis people called spurious
attacks on his record by the Bush camp.
   ``What was the most upsetting about that was that they were
effective,'' she said.

   George Bush's immediate family _ kids, spouses
and grandchildren _ is so big they've got enough for a football team
and a baseball team at the same time.
   With four sons and a daughter, Bush has one of the largest
families of any president in recent times. All his children are
married, and they have produced 10 grandchildren for Bush and his
wife, Barbara.
   Bush, 64, himself one of five children, openly boasts about his
kids, who have scattered across the country to pursue their own
careers in business and politics.
   The vice president once said the thing that made him most proud
in life was that his ``children still come home.''
   The Bushes are a tightly knit clan, though the president-elect
acknowledges they come out of a somewhat ``conservative tradition''
in which people tend to be reserved about displaying affection
publicly.
   Jeb Bush, 35, Bush's second son, once said their father was away
a lot when the children were growing up but ``if anything ever went
wrong in my life, Dad would be right there to help.''
   ``Mom was always the one to hand out the goodies and the
discipline,'' said Jeb, a real estate developer in Miami, and, until
recently, Florida's secretary of commerce. ``In a sense, it was a
matriarchal family.''
   Mrs. Bush, a full-time homemaker, devoted herself to running the
house and raising her children.
   Though Mrs. Bush handled family matters, Bush has said that his
office aides always knew ``when any of the kids called, no matter
what I was doing, they should be put through.'' He said he spent
time with the children individually on weekends, and he and his wife
always considered their responsibility as parents their top priority.
   Bush promised at the Republican National Convention in August to
show the American people ``how much my great, strong, big family
means to me.'' But he was also ridiculed for referring to three
grandchildren as ``the little brown ones.'' Their mother, Jeb's
wife, Columba, was born in Mexico.
   After the convention, Bush's children, George Bush Jr., 42, of
Midland, Texas; Jeb; Neil, 33, of Denver, Colo.; Marvin, 32, of
Alexandria, Va.; and Dorothy LeBlond, 29, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine,
spread out to campaign fulltime for their father's presidential
election.
   George Jr., a Harvard Business School graduate and independent
oil operator in Midland, was a top strategist in his father's
campaign. Married and the father of 6-year-old twin daughters,
George Jr. once waged an unsuccessful campaign for Congress in
Texas. He was a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard during the
Vietnam War.
   Jeb, a fluent Spanish speaker and a former Dade County Republican
chairman, has frequently courted Hispanic voters. Trained as a
banker, he once worked for Texas Commerce Bank in Caracas,
Venezuela. His children are George, 12, Noelle, 11, and Jeb Jr., 5.
   In the footsteps of his father and oldest brother, Neil is in the
oil business in Denver. A graduate of Tulane University, he and his
wife, Sharon, have two children, ages 2 and 4, and are expecting a
third early next year.
   Marvin, who graduated from the University of Virginia, is the
only child who has stayed nearby his parents in the 1980s. An
investment consultant, Marvin and his wife, Margaret, have a
2-year-old girl.
   Dorothy LeBlond _ ``Doro'' to her family _ is married to a
businessman, William LeBlond, and the mother of two children,
Samuel, 4, and Nancy, 2. A graduate of the Katherine Gibbs School in
Boston, Dorothy has frequently worked on her father's campaigns.
This year, she traveled around the country; in 1980, she answered
telephones at her father's headquarters when he ran unsuccessfully
for president.
   Dorothy was not the only daughter. The couple's other daughter,
Robin, born in 1949, died of leukemia when she was three. In his
autobiography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush wrote that the death had a
profound impact on him. He said his faith helped sustain him.
   ``To this day, like every parent who has ever lost a child, we
wonder why; yet we know that, whatever the reason, she is in God's
loving arms.''

<HEAD>Unique Show of Nigerian Screens to Open</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unique exhibit of fragile Nigerian memorial
screens built by the African nation's Kalabari people in honor of
their ancestors is going on display in a Washington museum.
   ``I don't know of any other people anywhere who make such
screens,'' said Philip Ravenhill, chief curator of Washington's new
National Museum of African Art. ``I don't think they'll ever be
brought together again.''
   The exhibit includes 11 of the 12 screens held by museums, mostly
in Britain.
   The screens are made of wood and fiber, and the largest are about
five feet tall. They feature human figures, usually with fantastic
headgear and a cloth over their knees on which whiskey or other
alcoholic drinks are poured by the Kalabari.
   They include many European elements _ a carving of a top hat that
seems to come from the 1820s, pieces of furniture, cannon balls,
bottles of drink, glasses, musical instruments. Some appear to be
modeled on European playing cards.
   Nigel Barley, a British anthropologist, prepared the exhibit's
descriptive catalog, called ``Foreheads of the Dead.'' The exhibit
opened today and will remain on display until Jan. 29.
   Barley said he is not sure the screens should be called art,
because their creators think of them differently.
   ``We now live in a world where other cultures use television
programs such as `Dallas' and `Dynasty' to understand their local
missionaries,'' he wrote.
   In 1916 the screens were threatened by a fundamentalist Christian
Kalabari, Garrick Braide. Kalabari chiefs gave a dozen of them to a
British district officer, P. Amaury Talbot, to save them from
destruction. He sent them to Britain for safety.
   Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, with 105 million
people. The roughly 500,000 Kalabari live near the Atlantic coast of
the west African republic.
   Once rich through trade in slaves for America, palm oil and fish,
the Kalabaris' marshy delta lands are now literally a backwater,
Barley says.
   The screens may go back to their first king, Amachree I of the
late 1700s, though they seem to have been made later than that. New
ones rarely appeared after the late 1800s, but old ones are often
rebuilt.
   ``But there was a new one about a year and a half ago, and we'll
have to see if they go on,'' Ravenhill said in an interview.
   The current Kalabari king is Amachree X.
   An accompanying exhibit consists of the metal sculpture of a
young Kalabari woman, Sokari Douglas Camp, who works in London. Her
sculptures include one of a Kalabari ceremonial boat, complete with
paddles worked by a motor.
   She had never seen one of the screens before visiting a London
museum.
   ``Women are not permitted to look,'' she explained.

   Physicists hope the superconducting super
collider will help them explain the very origin of matter itself and
perhaps lead them to their holy grail: a single theory that unites
all the forces of nature, from gravity spanning galaxies to the
mysterious bonds that hold the proton together.
   The first task of the collider, if it is built, may be a search
for the Higgs particle, named after Peter Higgs of the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland, the scientist who first postulated its
existence.
   Scientists say this subnuclear particle should emerge from
proton-proton collisions 20 times more powerful than anything
possible today. Finding it would be a giant step forward in
understanding nature.
   The super collider, a 53-miles around machine, will be the first
atom smasher able to concentrate in a small volume of space the
energy density that must have existed in the theoretical ``big
bang'' origin of the universe. The Energy Department on Thursday
selected a site near Dallas for the giant machine, even though
Congress has not yet decided it should be built.
   The current picture of nature, called the ``standard model,'' is
tantalizingly incorrect _ but nobody is sure just where it goes
wrong. At very high energies, the theory predicts certain particle
interactions will occur with greater than 100 percent probability _
which is an impossibility.
   Modifications to fix up the standard model almost always require
extremely energetic collisions for their experimental tests.
   A recent example of theory-testing on which the collider will
build is the discovery of the so-called W and Z particles at the
CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1983, predicted
by the ``electroweak'' theory. This shows the fundamental identity
of the familiar forces of electricity and magnetism and the weak
forces responsible for some forms of nuclear radioactivity,
including the reactions respnsible for the sun's energy.
   It is the W and Z particles that carry the unified
``electroweak'' force, just as it is the familiar photon or particle
of light that carries the electromagnetic force.
   Though the masses of the W and Z particles could be estimated in
advance as roughly 90 times that of the proton, there is no way to
calculate the mass of the Higgs particle. But scientists say there
should be an upper limit of about 1,000 times the mass of the proton.
   All mass is equivalent to energy, shown in the famous ``E=MC
squared'' relationship first developed by Albert Einsten. That is,
the energy of any particle is equal to its mass times the speed of
light squared.
   It's convenient to speak of mass in terms of ``electron volts,''
the energy acquired by an electron falling through a voltage.
Electrons in the filament of a flashlight bulb are accelerated
through 3 electron volts.
   The mass of a proton at rest is a little less than a billion
electron volts.
   The total collision energy must be around 40 trillion electron
volts to create a particle of 1 trillion electron volts. The world's
most powerful accelerator, at Fermi Lab in Chicago, can produce 2
trillion electron volts, whereas the super collider is designed to
generate 40 trillion electron volts.
   ``Our lack of understanding of the masses of the various
particles is a very deep problem,'' the super collider Central
Design Group wrote in its 1986 report.
   The standard model says protons and neutrons are made of smaller
particles called ``quarks'' held together by force-carrying
particles called ``gluons.''
   ``There is no understanding why the quarks and (associated
lighter particles) have the masses they do,'' the report said.
   The quarks seem to come in three families or generations: one
forms protons and neutrons and is associated with electrons; another
family, not found in nature, seems to be associated with the muon
particle; and a third associated with the tau particle.
   ``There is no understanding of why there are three generations;
in fact, there may be more,'' the report said.
   Other possible tasks for the super collider:
   _Electrons, muons, taus and neutrinos all appear to be simple
geometric points instead of collections of smaller particles. The
super collider may be able to see if this is true.
   _If there is a Higgs particle, is it made of smaller particles?
Some theories give it structure and postulate the existence of
forces inside it analagous to those inside the proton.
   _Another theory called ``supersymmetry'' predicts several Higgs
particles and accounts for all forces, including gravity, while
giving a partner particle to every known particle. This theory says
particles are made of ``superstrings'' of fantastically small
dimensions instead of geometrical points.
   _In the standard model, a proton should decay spontaneously, once
in a rare while. All attempts to spot such decay have failed.

<HEAD>More Dairy Price Increases Seen By Ag Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail prices for dairy products will rise in
the months ahead partly because of tight supplies at the wholesale
level, according to a new forecast from the Agriculture Department.
   ``However, increases in dairy prices are not likely to appear
dramatic in comparison with other prices,'' said the situation and
outlook report released by USDA earlier this week.
   The report noted that milk prices had already increased this year
and said the average rise in retail dairy costs for 1988 should be
about 2 percent over 1987 levels.
   The average September price for milk was $12.20 for each 100
pounds, down 50 cents from a year ago but an increase of 40 cents
over a month earlier.
   Markets for dairy products were already tight last summer when
the drought began to send feed prices soaring. The report said the
reason was strong domestic use of skim milk-based products and
rising demand for nonfat dry milk exports.
   Production was already easing when the drought struck, the report
said, a factor guaranteed to magnify the impact of higher feed
prices on milk production. Total 1988 milk production is expected to
be around 1 percent more, however, than the 1987 level of 142.5
billion pounds.
   Since May, prices of American cheese and nonfat dry milk have
climbed 15 percent to 20 percent, the report said.
   ``These markets probably will stay quite tight until yearend
because of low stocks, strong domestic and export demand and
weakening milk production,'' the report said. It said, however, that
butter prices have had difficulty holding last summer's small
increase.
   Feed prices most likely will be substantially higher next year
than they have been, primarily because of the drought, the report
said. It noted forecasts of corn production at its lowest level
since the 1983 drought.
   ``Use is not expected to decrease as much as production and
stocks may fall by two-thirds,'' the report said.
   It reiterated earlier estimates of a tighter soybean market as a
result of the drought.
   As a result, the report said, farmers are going to have to pay
more to feed their cows and therefore will have fewer cows producing
milk.
   ``The drought-caused boosts in feed costs will be the dominant
factor affecting milk production,'' it said.

   President Reagan's veto of a nutrition
monitoring bill was ``unfortunate and unnecessary,'' says a group of
lawmakers including the chairmen of the House and Senate agriculture
committees.
   ``The president's veto of nutrition monitoring legislation on
election day is astonishing,'' they said Thursday in a statement.
   The legislation called for a 10-year assessment of the health and
well being of Americans and the American diet with special focus on
the elderly, pregnant women, infants, children and the homeless.
   Under the bill, which Reagan vetoed Wednesday, the secretaries of
agriculture and health and human services would have reviewed in
advance any federal advice to consumers on what to eat and what not
to eat. The provision was designed to make the federal government
speak with one voice on nutrition and safety issues.
   ``We believe the veto of this legislation was unfortunate and
unnecessary,'' the statement said. ``We will press for passage of
this legislation at the outset of the 101st Congress,'' which meets
in January.
   In vetoing the bill, Reagan said that the ``administration
strongly supports the principal goals of this legislation and
reaffirms its commitment to use existing authority to achieve these
ends.''
   Reagan said in a statement, however, that ``enactment of the bill
would set up federal nutrition efforts on the wrong course.''
   ``The bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and
complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the
bill's goals,'' Reagan said.
   Administration opposition to the measure was well known but
lawmakers said nonetheless the veto disturbed them.
   ``This important bill would have required that the nutritional
health of Americans, especially vulnerable groups ... be carefully
monitored,'' the lawmakers said.
   It was signed by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J.
Leahy, D-Vt., and House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika''
de la Garza, D-Texas, as well as Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio; Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
and Reps. Robert Roe, D-N.J.; George Brown, D-Calif.; Leon Panetta,
D-Calif.; Doug Walgren, D-Pa., and Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y.
   ``This simple measure would also have made federal health and
nutrition guidance understandable,'' the statement said.
   The statement quoted Scott Balin, American Heart Association vice
president and legislative counsel, as saying: ``The president's veto
of (the bill) does a serious disservice to the health and welfare of
the American people.''
   ``We concur,'' the lawmakers said.

<HEAD>Government Ending 47-Year-Old Ban On Industrial Homework</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is lifting bans on homework in
the garment industry, fulfilling a promise made in 1980 by Ronald
Reagan during his presidential campaign.
   The bans were imposed 47 years ago to counter widespread
exploitation of immigrant and child laborers.
   New Labor Department regulations published Thursday and scheduled
to take effect Jan. 9 would allow homework for the first time since
the early 1940s in five garment industry trades: gloves and mittens,
embroideries, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry
work.
   Labor Secretary Ann Dore McLaughlin said lifting the prohibitions
will provide both employers and employees with greater flexibility
in dealing with work-family conflicts while at the same time
improving U.S. competitiveness in world markets.
   She said licensing of employers who hire home workers plus
increased enforcement by her department will assure compliance with
federal labor standards such as the minimum wage and prohibitions on
child labor.
   But unions vowed to challenge the regulations in court, saying
they will lead to a repeat of the sweatshop conditions, illegally
low pay and abuse of child labor that first prompted the home work
prohibitions.
   Industrial homework has been a major deregulation battleground
between unions on one side and the administration and business
groups on the other for the past eight years.
   The AFL-CIO, afraid of losing members or being unable to organize
workers if they are dispersed in their homes instead of in offices
or factories, last year called for expanding the current
prohibitions to include computer terminal work.
   Businesses, seeking to reduce labor costs, have been
subcontracting jobs in increasing numbers to people working out of
their homes. Link Resources, a private research firm, estimates more
than 23 million people are now performing all or part of their jobs
at home and says the rate is growing by 7.5 percent a year.
   ``The changing work force demographics demand that we provide
employment opportunities that allow workers the freedom to choose
flexible alternatives, including the ability to work in one's own
home,'' Mrs. McLaughlin said Thursday. ``Women, for example, have
entered the work force by the millions.''
   Homework, she said, allows both employers and employees to
address child and elderly care and parental leaves without added
costs.
   Jay Mazur, president of the 173,000-member International Ladies
Garment Workers Union, called the new regulations a ``callous and
illegal betrayal of American workers'' and said his union will file
suit to prevent them from being implemented.
   The garment workers and other unions have twice before repelled
the administration's attempts to lift the prohibitions on homework.
The administration won a limited victory in 1984, lifting the ban on
knitted outerwear, but only after a three-year court fight.
   Mazur said the administration ``cynically waited for American
working people to cast their ballots'' before launching what he
called its latest ``sneak attack on workers' rights.''
   ``With no public announcement, the lame duck White House has
given the green light to ... condemn countless American workers to
exploitation and sweatshop conditions,'' he said.
   The current prohibitions were adopted between 1941 and 1943 under
the Fair Labor Standards Act in response to reports of rampant
exploitation of immigrant and child home workers paid on a piecework
basis.
   The General Accounting Office, a watchdog arm of Congress, said
in a report three months ago that sweatshop conditions are still
rampant in the clothing industry.
   And it quoted many state and federal officials as saying the
problem has gotten worse rather than better over the past decade,
particularly among Haitian, Asian, Hispanic and Mexican immigrants.
   The new regulations do not attempt to overturn state bans on
garment industry homework in Hawaii, California, Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and New Jersey.
   About 75,000 people _ none of them home workers _ are now
employed in the five industries in which a ban on homework is being
eliminated, according to union officials.
   Despite the current prohibitions, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
estimates there already are about 122,000 garment home workers, most
paid on a piecework basis.

   Congress is reluctant to raise its pay and that
of judges and other top federal employees because voters unhappy
with such increases often make legislators pay at the polls, says
one congressman supporting an increase.
   ``Members find it excruciatingly difficult to vote on pay
raises,'' Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., told a presidential commission.
``We know our constituents often earn far less than us.''
   Fazio had no formal opposition Tuesday as he won election to a
sixth term, but he said his constituents still will be unhappy with
his support of a pay increase.
   ``My appearance here kicks off my opponent's next campaign,
whoever he or she is,'' joked Fazio, speaking Thursday to the panel,
known formally as the President's Quadrennial Commission on
Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries.
   Although no figures have been announced, the commission is likely
to approve higher pay rates next month and the raises for members of
Congress may be linked to a recommendation that outside income _
honoraria _ be eliminated.
   If President Reagan endorses the proposals in his Jan. 9 budget,
the raises would automatically take effect within 30 days unless
both the House and Senate pass resolutions of disapproval.
   By law, the commission meets after each presidential election. It
held a special session in 1986 and recommended raising congressional
salaries from $77,400 a year to $135,000, a 74 percent boost. Reagan
approved a pay raise to $89,500, the current level.
   The pay of other top officials is pegged to that level. For
example, federal judges are also paid $89,500, while federal appeals
court judges make $95,000 and Supreme Court members are paid
$110,700. The chief justice is paid $115,000.
   Fazio agreed with Howard Baker, the former Senate Republican
leader, that Congress has a difficult time approving pay hikes
because of the possible repercussions from voters.
   Having Congress vote on its own salary ``is the granddaddy
conflict of interest of all times,'' Baker said. ``You've got an
electorate that loves to take a bite out of your leg ... there's
nothing that's closer to home than examining the pay of public
officials.''
   Former Chief Justice Warren Burger told the panel the salary cap
has made it difficult for the federal judiciary to retain judges.
   ``Many highly qualified, fine people have declined appointments
to federal courts'' because they can make far more money in private
practice, Burger told the panel.
   ``There are very few judges who are not making less today than in
the last year of their practice, even if they have been on the bench
20, 25 years,'' he said. Many judges appointed at a young age later
resign when they have children in college because they need to make
more money, he said.
   He suggested that federal judges be paid $150,000. ``This would
stop this drain of talent,'' Burger said.
   Baker agreed. ``I am well aware that most Americans would not see
a $60,000 or $70,000 job as compelling evidence of a vow of
poverty,'' he said. ``But when a federal judge makes less money than
a young attorney just out of law school, it seems to me we have
turned our values upside down.''
   Burger was also supported by the American Bar Association, whose
president, Robert Raven, said there is a ``looming crisis'' because
of the salary cap.
   An ABA survey found that 28 percent of the current federal judges
are considering leaving their jobs because they can make far more
money in private law practice, Raven said.

<HEAD>Forest Fire Smoke Study Supports Theory Of Nuclear Winter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dramatic drops in temperature under the thick
smoke produced by forest fires support the theory that the firestorm
of a nuclear war could lead to an artificial winter of cold, crop
failure and starvation, according to a study published today.
   Alan Robock, a professor at the University of Maryland department
of meteorology, said temperatures dropped as much as 36 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 20 degrees Celsius, below normal in California
mountain valleys that were shrouded for days last year by smoke from
forest fires.
   The studies are based on temperature readings taken in the
Klamath River Canyon of Northern California starting on Aug. 30,
1987, after lightning triggered forest fires that burned for more
than a month.
   Robock said smoke from the fires was trapped in the valleys of
the area by a temperature inversion. The smoke blocked much of the
sunlight from reaching the valley floors, and the temperatures there
dropped dramatically.
   ``Virtually all the sunlight that is not reflected by the smoke
is absorbed before it reaches the ground, thereby strongly cooling
the ground while slightly heating the air,'' Robock wrote in the
journal Science.
   Temperatures, he said, dropped swiftly. By Sept. 7, a week after
the fires started, the high temperature readings at Happy Camp, a
point near the Oregon border, had cooled to 62.6 degrees, 36 degrees
below the normal maximum for the season.
   Happy Camp, in a valley covered with smoke, became much cooler
than Slater, a town on a ridge to the north that was not covered.
Normally, he said, Happy Camp would have higher maximum temperatures
than Slater because of the difference in elevation.
   Robock said tomato plants in Happy Camp gardens, hit by the
sudden chill and dense smoke, produced no fruit and died.
   Following a nuclear war, said Robock, the effect would be much
more widespread and much more severe.
   Nuclear wars, he said, would set cities on fire, causing a smoke
that would be much denser and darker. This would block out even more
sunlight and cause an even deeper temperature drop.
   ``Forest fire smoke would not be as black as the smoke from
burning cities, where oil and plastics would burn,'' said Robock in
a telephone interview.
   He said the forest fire smoke in California actually intensified
the temperature inversion that caused the smoke to hang in the air
for weeks. This came as a surprise.
   ``This is one of the unknown mechanisms in the climate system
that could make a nuclear winter even worse than we thought,'' said
Robock.
   The nuclear winter theory forecasts that an exchange of atomic
weapons would so fill the atmosphere with smoke and particles that
it would block sunlight and cause the Earth below to cool quickly.
The chill would be enough to cause crops to fail. People who
survived the lethal blasts of heat, pressure and radiation would
then have to battle hunger and starvation as food shortages
developed.
   ``Some of the models predict that there could be no food
available (from growing crops) for a year or more,'' said Robock.
   Robock's study was published in today's issue of Science,
published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Report Says Arms Agency Misplaced Many Top Secret Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency cannot
locate scores of top secret documents or 62 security safes, in part
because its records are ``inaccurate, incomplete and out of date,''
the General Accounting Office reports.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, also said Thursday
that the arms control agency's top secret control officer in
Washington had delegated his duties to a file clerk and took no
steps to ensure the employee protected classified material.
   It said the agency had no system for controlling documents at the
offices of the U.S. arms reduction negotiating team and had neither
named a top secret control officer nor created a top secret document
log.
   The report said that while ACDA officials maintained that arms
control negotiators in Geneva had access to few if any top secret
documents, ``in our review of a sample of 26 out of 256 safe drawers
we found more than 150 uncontrollable top secret documents.''
   A principal finding: ``Although ACDA has established procedures
for handling and controlling top secret documents at its Washington
headquarters, it has no mechanism to ensure compliance with them.''
   ``ACDA's records of its top secret documents were inaccurate,
incomplete and out of date ...,'' the GAO said. ``Thus, ACDA cannot
assure it can account for all top secret documents.''
   The GAO, which said corrective steps are now being taken, said
ACDA's Washington top secret control log is unreliable to assure
classified information is adequately protected because it is laced
with ``clerical and substantive errors.''
   The arms control agency said it could not locate scores of
requested top secret documents that had been entered in the log, the
report said.
   The General Accounting Office said it had pinpointed a number of
other allegedly sloppy or lax security procedures. It noted that the
arms control agency had not changed the combinations of security
safes as often as required and had placed some highly classified
``code word'' documents in improper containers.
   It said its survey at ACDA's Washington headquarters found that
the agency could not locate 62 safes listed in its records but did
have 42 safes for which there were no records at all.
   ``In Geneva, combinations to safes were not changed when ACDA
personnel using the safes were transferred or their employment was
terminated,'' the report said.
   The Geneva safe combinations were last changed during September
and October 1987, the report said and added: ``Although many of the
same staff returned for the round of negotiations that began in
January 1988, some did not, including one former employee under
investigation for unreported trips to the Soviet Union.''
   The GAO said the arms control agency has begun to take corrective
actions, including a May 2 memo to all staff members which ``stated
that security is a priority and emphasized the need to protect
classified information and material within the agency.''
   It said the arms control agency believes most missing documents
can be accounted for and is updating records on the numbers and
locations of safes.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee which requested the GAO report, said: ``It is quite clear
there was a lapse in security. The lapse was serious in nature ...''
   But Fascell said he was encouraged that ACDA Director William
Burns apparently is committed to improving the agency's security
practices. ``The record to date is that ACDA is making every
possible effort to implement the GAO's recommendations.''

<HEAD>Report Says Home Prices Soaring In California, Falling In Oil
Regions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home prices are skyrocketing in California,
rising sluggishly in once red-hot markets in the Northeast,
rebounding in the industrial Midwest and falling in the Southwestern
oil regions, a real estate trade group says.
   The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that three
California metropolitan areas _ Anaheim-Santa Ana, Los Angeles and
San Francisco _ continue to lead the nation in appreciation of
existing single-family homes.
   A 32.1 percent rise in median prices in the July-September
quarter over that period a year ago kept the Anaheim-Santa Ana area
the costliest housing market in the nation, with a median price of
$226,200.
   Los Angeles, where prices rose 23.7 percent to $190,900, had the
second highest appreciation rate, followed by San Francisco, which
had a 21.5 percent increase to a median of $213,700, meaning half
sold for more and half for less.
   In Honolulu, where the median price of $226,000 was the
second-highest in the nation, home prices climbed 18.6 percent, the
fourth best appreciation rate.
   Nationally, the third-quarter median resale price for
single-family homes was $90,200, up 3.9 percent from a year earlier.
   ``The West Coast is amazing. Who knows how long they'll be able
to keep it up,'' said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions.
   He attributed high prices in San Francisco to scarcity of
suitable land for building and in Honolulu to buying by Japanese
investors.
   But, sooner or later, high prices likely will cut into buying and
cause price increases to moderate, as they have in the Northeast, he
said.
   The most expensive areas to buy a home, following Anaheim-Santa
Ana and Honolulu, were, in order, San Francisco, New York, Los
Angeles, Boston, Hartford, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and
Providence, R.I.
   But, appreciation rates in New York, Boston and Hartford, Conn.,
were below the national average. The median price in Philadelphia
actually fell by 3.5 percent.
   Home prices in the New York metropolitan area, including Long
Island and northern New Jersey, rose to $192,600 in the third
quarter, up 1.2 percent from the same period a year earlier. Prices
were up 1.0 percent in Boston to a median of $184,100.
   ``The Northeast has finally cooled off after leading the nation
in both sales and price increases over the last three years,'' said
John A. Tuccillo, chief economist of the Realtors organization.
   Among cities in the industrial heartland, prices rose 17.7
percent in Buffalo, N.Y., the fifth best climb in the nation; 14.0
percent in Detroit and 10.5 percent in Chicago. Appreciation rates
also were above average in Grand Rapids, Mich.; Akron, Toledo and
Cincinnati, Ohio; Indianapolis; St. Louis, Mo.; Milwaukee, and
Minneapolis.
   ``Rising exports (causing a resurgence at U.S. manufacturing
plants) have led to a surprisingly robust housing market in the
Midwest,'' Tuccillo said.
   Earlier in the 1980s, the Midwest lagged other regions in price
increases and the least-costly cities are still in that region. Des
Moines, Iowa, with a median price of $55,000, was the cheapest,
followed by Louisville, Ky.; Lansing, Mich.; Oklahoma City; and
Grand Rapids, Mich.
   Fifteen metropolitan areas showed price declines from a year
earlier, led by Denver, with a 10.9 percent drop. Baton Rouge, La.;
Oklahoma City; and San Antonio and Dallas, Texas, all suffered
declines greater than 5 percent.
   ``The collapse of the oil-based economy and the overbuilding that
had taken place continue to produce downward pressure on home prices
in these areas,'' Obrinsky said.
   ``But at least in the case of Texas, we've seen some increase in
population, along with economic growth, so it looks like we're
coming to the end of this process.''
   Home prices in Houston and San Antonio have risen over the past
six months, but are still below prices a year ago.
   Meanwhile, the pace of sales in Texas improved 10.2 percent
between the second and third quarters after holding steady for two
quarters.
   Nationally, the Realtors group said the resale pace of
condominiums and single-family homes declined a slight 0.7 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 4 million units, down from
4.03 million units in the second quarter.
   Tuccillo attributed the sales decline to a slight increase in
mortgage rates. According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
interest charged for fixed-rate mortgages, excluding add-on fees
known as points, averaged 10.5 percent in the third quarter, up from
10.39 percent in the second quarter.
   Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia posted
quarter-to-quarter increases in the July-September sales pace,
compared with 32 states showing increases in the second quarter.
Twenty-three states posted sales declines, while two were unchanged.

   Fred Barnes, an astute political analyst, calls
James A. Baker ``Mr. Shmooze'' and describes him in a recent profile
in New Republic magazine as America's most overrated man.
   Barnes acknowledges that Baker was a capable White House chief of
staff and a skillful campaign operative. ``But,'' Barnes says, ``he
has mastered the cynical trick of identifying himself with successes
and disassociating himself from blunders.''
   Barnes cited Baker's timing in signing on as chief of George
Bush's 1988 campaign just as it was about to surge and avoiding
blame for a big tax increase and lack of success in trimming the
trade deficit as treasury secretary.
   The writer also raised questions about the briefing books
prepared for Jimmy Carter in his 1980 debate with Ronald Reagan that
mysteriously fell into the hands of Reagan's campaign team.
   The appellation ``Mr. Shmooze'' refers to the smooth Texan's
careful cultivation of reporters who nearly uniformly give him high
marks for judgment. Barnes thinks if Bush, who was managed by his
friend Baker, had not dropped out of the 1980 Republican campaign he
might have wrested the presidential nomination from Reagan that year.
   All that and current campaign sleaze allegations aside, Baker, if
confirmed by the Senate as the 61s secretary of state, will have the
advantage of extremely close ties to the president. ``He will hit
the ground running,'' said George P. Shultz, who has been in the job
for more than six years.
   Bush gave Baker a quick start by selecting him more than two
months before the new administration takes over. Next Tuesday, Baker
is expected to be at the State Department to begin transition
discussions and to start learning the job.
   His background in foreign policy is limited. He has never been to
the Soviet Union or to the Middle East, with the exception of Saudi
Arabia. His views on U.S. relations with Moscow and on the
Israeli-Arab dispute are unknown.
   His political skills are not.
   Baker played a key and possibly critical role in 1981 in winning
the Senate's approval for the Saudis to purchase advanced radar
planes from the United States. The vote was 52-48. Baker offered
vague legal assurances that Israel's security would be safeguarded
in order to entice a handful of wavering Republicans to the White
House's side.
   It was one of the few arms sales battles any administration has
managed to win over Israel's supporters.
   Baker is experienced in international economics, has traveled to
17 countries and regularly attended National Security Council
meetings at the White House as Reagan's chief of staff and as
treasury secretary.
   The skills of persuasion with which he is credited by Barnes and
other political observers could be a valuable asset in diplomacy.
Personal relations often smooth the way for strategic objectives.
   But clearly Baker's biggest asset is his close tie to Bush, who
will be in charge of foreign policy. Baker should not have any
problems figuring out what the boss has in mind. Nor is he likely to
be harassed by the White House or National Security Council.
   The three-quarters of a mile from the State Department to the
White House has seemed a much greater distance to some recent
secretaries of state.
   At work in their office on the seventh floor, they sometimes had
to wonder what sort of advice the president was getting from the NSC
or from White House staffers.
   Cyrus Vance frequently clashed over policy with Zbigniew
Brzezinski, who was President Jimmy Carter's security adviser. The
disagreements contributed to Vance's decision to resign in April
1980, although the main reason was Carter's attempt to rescue
American hostages through an unworkable military operation.
   Henry Kissinger had no such problem. Under President Richard
Nixon and, for a while under President Gerald Ford, he held the dual
jobs of secretary of state and security adviser. Kissinger wasn't in
the habit of disagreeing with himself.
   Baker's ability to get along with people will help him. Besides,
the chances are he would work well with the two men who apparently
are the leading candidates for the NSC job: Brent Scowcroft, who
held it under Ford, and Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador to China.

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Making New Attack on Landmark Abortion Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is making a new
attack on the Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion, proposing that the justices use a Missouri case
to reconsider the 15-year-old ruling.
   The proposal came in form of a brief filed with the court
Thursday by Solicitor General Charles Fried, who said the Missouri
case represents ``an appropriate opportunity'' for the justices to
review the 1973 decision.
   Pro-abortion groups said the timing of the proposal, two days
after the general election, was political.
   ``I guess they were afraid to do this before the election because
they thought they might lose the votes of millions of women,'' said
Eve Paul, Planned Parenthood's vice president for legal affairs.
   But a Justice Department spokesman, Loye Miller, insisted that
the timing was dictated by extended internal discussions at the
Justice Department on the question and by extensive staff work that
had to be completed.
   Fried's brief said the Missouri case ``is free of procedural
defects and implicates a number of the legislative choices
foreclosed by Roe v. Wade.''
   The solicitor general's brief noted that the Reagan
administration's views on abortion were expressed in a case in June
1986, when the government urged that Roe vs. Wade be overturned.
   The high court at that time voted 5-4 to reaffirm the earlier
ruling, but since then another Reagan appointee has joined the
court, Justice Anthony Kennedy. Anti-abortion groups hope that will
tilt the court's balance and lead to scuttling of Roe vs. Wade,
which held that a woman has a constitutional right to an abortion.
   Missouri officials want the Supreme Court to reinstate a strict
state anti-abortion law, struck down in July by a federal appeals
court which said the statute was invalid under Roe vs. Wade.
   The Missouri law declared that human life begins at the moment of
conception and said no public funds, employees or facilities could
be used to perform or assist in an abortion or to counsel a woman to
have an abortion.
   A key issue in the Missouri case is whether it is
unconstitutional for a state to declare when human life begins. The
Missouri law did that, and went on to declare that ``unborn children
have protectable interests in life, health and well-being.''
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in July struck down those
declarations, saying that it is unconstitutional for a state to
adopt one theory of when human life begins.
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, said the Missouri case offers the high court a
chance to address important issues, such as limits on abortions late
in pregnancy, even if it decides not to use the case to overturn Roe
vs. Wade.
   ``We're not predicting that the court would use this case as the
occasion to overturn Roe vs. Wade,'' Johnson said. ``That's a
possibility. Of course, we would be delighted if they did.''
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,
called Fried's brief ``a sneak attack on women's lives.''
   She said that if the Reagan administration gambit works,
precedents could be established to ``put at risk not only legal
abortion but the pill and IUD.''
   ``They didn't have the guts to do it before the election,'' added
Molly Yard, president of the 160,000-member National Organization
for Women. ``It's a sneaky, lowdown thing they've done.''
   There was extensive discussion at the top levels of the Justice
Department over whether it would be advisable for Fried to file a
brief in the case at all or whether the solicitor general ought to
file a full brief outlining arguments for overturning Roe vs. Wade,
said a high department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Instead, a middle course was favored in which the solicitor
general would characterize the Missouri case as an appropriate
vehicle for the justices to reconsider Roe vs. Wade, said the
official.
   The Missouri case, William L. Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services, was brought to the attention of newly installed Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh shortly after he started work last summer,
the Justice Department official said.
   Thornburgh, as governor of Pennsylvania, was involved in the 1986
case in which the court upheld Roe vs. Wade on a 5-4 vote.
   That case, Thornburgh vs. American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, involved a Pennsylvania law passed in 1982 that would
have required physicians to record intimate details about a woman
seeking an abortion.
   Pennsylvania legislators acknowledged that the law, frequently
characterized as the toughest anti-abortion law of any state, was
intended to discourage women from an abortion.
   That law, too, was struck down as unconstitutional.

   Two days after TV talk-show host Phil Donahue
took on women wrestlers, Geraldo Rivera isn't making any bones about
having his nose broken in a brawl on today's edition of his
syndicated show, ``Geraldo.''
   In the show, taped in New York on Nov. 3, a fight broke out
between black activists and representatives of a professed racist
organization. Rivera was hit with a chair and his nose is broken
when he tried to stop the free-for-all.
   In what is being advertised as an ``unprecedented'' move, Rivera
has taped a special introduction for today's ``Geraldo'' installment:
   ``As most of you already know, and as you can see by the way I
look right now, today's program on `Young Hatemongers' came to an
unexpectedly violent conclusion,'' Rivera says. ``Parents, be
advised that the language and violence contained makes this show
inappropriate for small children.''

   After three years in the making, a record
album saluting American soldiers has been completed in time for
Veterans Day thanks to help from some top musicians and singers,
including Dolly Parton's sister Stella Parton and instrumentalists
Mark O'Connor and Bela Fleck.
   Singer Bobby Ross, a former member of the 101st Airborne Division
at Fort Campbell, Ky., performs tunes like ``Finally Welcomed
Home,'' ``Saigon State of Mind,'' ``Too Close to the Line'' and ``No
Home for the Brave (in the Land of the Free).''
   Parton did background vocals for the LP, ``Voice of America.''
O'Connor, a finalist this year for Country Music Association
musician of the year, played fiddle and mandolin. Fleck, of the
group New Grass Revival, played banjo.
   ``Mark O'Connor said he was doing this so there wouldn't be
another Vietnam,'' said Don Hoffman, a Navy veteran who spearheaded
the project.
   Country stars George Strait, Ricky Skaggs, Rosanne Cash, Rodney
Crowell and Sharon White are on the board of directors of a
non-profit corporation administering a scholarship fund being
created from the album's proceeds, Hoffman said. The scholarships
will go to descendants of Americans killed in wars.

   The makers of ``The Karate Kid Part III'' are
looking for a new challenger for star Ralph Macchio, but they say
you've got to be young, tough and handsome.
   More than 2,000 hopefuls are expected to try out in open

   Maestro Lorin Maazel has filled the void
created by the departure of Andre Previn from the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra four years ago.
   Maazel made his debut Thursday night as music director of the
100-member orchestra, which he first joined in his teens as a
full-time violinist and apprentice conductor.
   ``I enjoy being here. I am an American and I feel my place is in
this country even though I've conducted so much abroad,'' said
Maazel, 58.
   Maazel's appearance Thursday night was his first public act as
the symphony's music director. He had been serving since 1984 as the
orchestra's music consultant.
   Symphony officials are counting on Maazel to be the orchestra's
ticket to greater international recognition and financial success.
The symphony projects a loss in 1987-88 of $1.5 million, its largest
ever.
   Maazel formerly was director of the Vienna State Opera, and for
10 years before that was with the Cleveland Orchestra.

   Singer John Cougar Mellencamp has failed in an
attempt to regain publishing rights to songs he sold 11 years ago
when he was a struggling rock 'n' roller.
   The singer had sued Riva Music Ltd. in a federal court in
Manhattan, saying its president, William Gaff, agreed to sell back
the songs for $3 million.
   But the court recently rejected Mellencamp's contention that Gaff
shook hands on the deal, noting that such agreements are normally
put on paper.
   The native of Seymour, Ind., sold the songs when he was known as
Johnny Cougar.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects North's Request For Dismissal Of Iran-Contra Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says he rejected defense
motions to dismiss the case against former presidential aide Oliver
L. North because they reflected a cynical attempt by the Iran-Contra
defendant to put himself above the law.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell wrote that North's
arguments for dismissing charges he lied to then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III and destroyed National Security Council documents
``reveals a skewed attitude toward our form of constitutional
government.''
   North is accused of obstructing a November 1986 presidential
inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair by lying to Meese about
diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to Nicaraguan rebels.
   North contends he committed no crime because Meese lacked legal
authority to question him.
   ``Ours is a country governed by the rule of law,'' Gesell said in
his opinion released Thursday. ``There is nothing in the
Constitution, federal statutes or applicable decisions which
warrants this cynical approach. To merely state it provides the
response. This court must reject it totally.''
   In a separate development, the Justice Department touched off a
confrontation with independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh by
objecting to a brief he filed in North's case. It said the brief
``mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles,'' but Walsh
issued a statement rejecting the accusation.
   Gesell said North, in seeking to have the case against him
dismissed, was arguing that ``he had the absolute right to lie, to
obstruct such inquiries, and to remove or destroy official NSC
records because he had not been warned that if he did so he might be
indicted.''
   North ``fails to appreciate the gravity of his alleged conduct,''
the judge said.
   ``North did in fact have fair warning that mendacity and
obstruction, coupled with destruction of official documents, was
illegal,'' the judge wrote.
   Defense lawyers argued that North couldn't be prosecuted for
giving false answers because he wasn't subpoenaed or placed under
oath by Meese and that the attorney general's inquiry was not a
``pending proceeding'' before a government agency.
   ``If the allegations in the indictment are factually correct,
North breached the high public duty with which he was entrusted''
when questioned by Meese on Nov. 23, 1986, the judge said.
   ``The court will not give judicial approval to the suggestion
that he was free in these circumstances to place his personal
interests or objections to national policy ahead of the public trust
he had accepted,'' Gesell wrote.
   Walsh, the independent counsel, ``will need only to prove at
trial that the specific questions posed to North by the attorney
general were precise and material to this legitimate presidential
inquiry'' and that North purposely lied, the judge said.
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiring
with former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Gesell also indicated he would deny similar motions to dismiss
charges that North lied to Congress in 1985 and 1986 about his role
in covert aid to the Contras.
   No date has been set for North's trial, the first of four
separate trials ordered by the judge.
   In its court filing critical of Walsh's Oct. 25 pleading in the
North case, the Justice Department asked Gesell for permission to
``articulate, clearly and definitively the executive's view of the
law which governs the relationship between the president and the
Congress.''
   The department said it wanted to submit a friend-of-the-court
brief because Walsh's pleading ``contains numerous statements that
are inconsistent with previously articulated statements of the law
by the Department of Justice and other Executive Branch agencies and
departments.''
   It said the prosecution brief supporting the charges against
North ``mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles of
separation of powers and executive branch authority.''
   A department assertion that it was not consulted by Walsh before
he filed his brief drew a tart response from the prosecutor.
   ``The independent counsel rejects the suggestion that it should
have solicited the views of the Department of Justice or that it has
mischaracterized the law,'' Walsh's office said in a statement.
   ``While the independent counsel does not object to the submission
of legal views by the department, it strenuously opposes this wholly
unjustified 11th-hour motion for an extension of time,'' the
statement said.
   Justice Department officials refused to describe the specific
legal disagreements with Walsh, which they plan to outline in the
pleading they want to file by Nov. 25.
   The department appeared to be objecting to Walsh's statements
about Congress' role in foreign affairs and how North and Poindexter
impaired legislative oversight by secretly financing the Nicaraguan
rebels at a time when such aid was banned by the Boland Amendment.

<HEAD>Bush Already Faces Higher Reagan Deficit Estimate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush has been given the
glum news that the budget deficit in the next fiscal year will be
$21 billion higher than the Reagan administration had previously
estimated.
   That information means that Bush will be facing an even bigger
budget headache when he takes office on Jan. 20.
   The new deficit estimate was presented to Bush and President
Reagan during a Cabinet briefing Thursday on the administration's
final budget submission to Congress.
   Joseph Wright Jr., director of the Office of Management and
Budget, said the OMB now estimates that the deficit for the 1990
fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, will be $132 billion,
substantially higher than the $111 billion deficit estimate OMB made
just three months ago.
   Officials said the main factors boosting the deficit estimate
were the drought, which slowed economic growth this year, and
higher-than-expected interest rates, which raised the cost of
financing the $2.6 trillion national debt.
   The Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's deficit target for 1990 is
$100 billion, which means that $32 billion in budget cuts will be
needed to close the gap between revenues and spending.
   Achieving such sizable cuts in the face of congressional
opposition to further reductions in domestic programs will present
Bush with major political problems.
   During the campaign, Bush sidestepped specifics on how he would
deal with the budget deficit by touting a plan for a ``flexible
freeze.'' Bush said he would allow government spending to grow only
enough to match inflation. Within the overall freeze, selected
programs could grow while others would be cut.
   However, Bush avoided providing details on what programs he would
cut in order to free funds for increases that he promised to make in
education, child care and health care for the poor.
   The budget document Reagan sends to Congress on Jan. 9 will
reflect his decisions, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   However, officials said it was likely that Bush would rewrite at
least part of the document once he takes office, just as Reagan did
in 1981 when he submitted his own budget to Congress in place of the
budget left behind by President Carter.
   Officials refused to comment on reports that the final Reagan
budget will call for substantial increases in defense spending and
steep cuts in domestic programs as a way of providing Bush with the
opportunity to present a ``kinder, gentler'' budget blueprint once
he takes office.
   OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay said that Reagan's final budget
would not include any tax increases, something the president has
consistently opposed, or seek to trim Social Security benefits as a
way of meeting the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman deficit target.
   ``We have some difficult choices ahead'' on where to cut
spending, she said.
   With estimates on future deficits rising, many private economists
are convinced that Bush will be forced to accept some type of tax
increase despite his oft-repeated opposition to new taxes during the
campaign.
   As examples of pressure for increased spending, they point to
public demands that the government do more in the fight against
drugs, and to estimates topping $50 billion for the cost of bailing
out hundreds of insolvent savings and loan institutions.
   House Speaker Jim Wright on Thursday said that the first signal
on whether Bush is serious about reducing the budget deficit is
likely to come from his appointment of two members to the National
Economic Commission, a bipartisan advisory group created to come up
with a blueprint for eliminating the budget deficit.
   Bush criticized the commission during the campaign as a device
for raising taxes, but Wright said if Bush is serious about dealing
with the deficit, he will weigh carefully his appointments, which
are expected to be made soon.
   ``Will they be pragmatic people, will they be realistic people,
will they be people dedicated to finding a true solution to this
enormous budget crisis?'' Wright, D-Texas, asked. ``I think that may
be his first signal.''
   Also providing hope to some that a resolution can be reached in
the seven-year budget deadlock is the widespread expectation that
Bush will name Richard Darman as the new budget director.
   Darman, a longtime aide to former Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III, is considered a pragmatist who would seek to work with
Congress in crafting deficit-cutting solutions.
   Wright repeatedly refused to offer his own view on how to make
the needed budget savings although he said he had many questions
about how Bush's flexible freeze would work.
   ``I have an open mind and I'm willing to listen to the
president's refinement of exactly how he interprets the meaning of
that phrase,'' Wright said.

   Oinker the pig isn't very choosy about
eating a day's worth of cookies, doughnuts, chewing gum and grain,
but when it comes to soft drinks, don't waste his time by offering
Coca-Cola.
   The swine took the Pepsi challenge, and his mind is made up.
   ``He can drink about a six-pack a day,'' said Oinker's owner,
12-year-old Randy ``Cool'' Proffitt, whose father, Woody, runs the
35-acre Dunn Rovin' Stables where Oinker lives.
   One day at the stables, Randy gave Oinker a can of Coke. The pig
took one taste and flipped the can to the dirt with his snout before
going to the Pepsi can and chugging it, Randy said.
   Other soft drinks have been offered since then, but Oinker
remains loyal.
   ``He won't drink nothing but Pepsi,'' Randy said. ``No orange, no
Dr Pepper. Just Pepsi.''
   It all began when folks who bought a drink from the stable's soda
machine would offer Oinker a swig. Now, it's a regular habit for the
4-month-old, 150-pound porker.
   ``If he hears money go into the machine now, he'll go right to
the machine,'' Randy's father said. ``And, of course, you better
give him some or he'll aggravate you to death.''

   City officials, barring goats from Goat
Hill, have ordered a family to get rid of their billy named Barney.
   Angela Raj Kumar said her family has been ordered to move Barney
Jr., a 3-foot tall, 80-pound miniature pygmy goat, because their
Goat Hill home is not zoned for livestock.
   The family contends Barney is a pet, not a goat, and has full run
of the house. In fact, Ms. Raj Kumar said, Barney thinks he's a dog.
   ``He does everything with the dogs,'' Ms. Raj Kumar said. ``We
even take him for walks on the Back Bay without a leash. He plays
just like a dog. We give him baths just like a dog.''
   ``A goat is a goat,'' said city Animal Control Officer Robert
O'Brien. ``A pygmy is just a smaller goat. If you let livestock
animals in the neighborhoods, it would smell like old MacDonald's
farm every time the breeze turned toward you.''
   The dispute arose in September when one of Ms. Raj Kumar's
neighbors complained about Barney.
   After being told to get rid of the goat, Ms. Raj Kumar collected
25 signatures on a petition. She presented the papers to City
Council this week.
   ``A lot of them (petition signers) said, `Oh, you have a goat? I
didn't even know,''' Ms. Raj Kumar said. ``And we've had him almost
three years.''
   Barney Jr. spends most of his time in the family's back yard with
a few chickens and a couple of dogs. He's quiet and doesn't small
bad.
   ``He's cheaper to feed than the dogs,'' said Ms. Raj Kumar.
``Plus, he helps me keep the lawn down. I never have to mow.''

   Seven people were killed when a tanker
truck carrying liquified natural gas collided with a pickup truck on
Margarita Island, a local resort off eastern Venezuela, authorities
said.
   The accident Thursday burned to death the pickup driver, his wife
and 9-year-old niece. The tanker, rocketed in the air by the blast,
crushed three pedestrians to death as it fell, and the driver later
died of burns at a local hospital, police and doctors said.
   Forty other people, including 12 children, suffered burns. Twenty
of the most seriously injured were transferred by military plane 210
miles southwest to Caracas for treatment.
   The tank truck belonged to the state oil company Corporven, an
affiliate of Petroleos de Venezuela.

   George Bush is spending his first days
as president-elect on a fishing, golf and tennis vacation, while
aides back in Washington work on the transition that will put his
administration in the White House next year.
   As he arrived at the West Palm Beach airport Thursday night, Bush
said the transition effort ``couldn't be going better'' in answer to
a reporter's shouted question.
   The president-elect was upbeat as he arrived in the balmy beach
community where he and his wife Barbara were met by Gov. Bob
Martinez. Bush said he was feeling ``great.''
   Asked about a morning meeting wih the leaders of his transition
team, Craig Fuller and Robert Teeter, Bush laughingly said it had
been ```absolutely fantastic'' and then disappeared into his
limousine.
   He is staying at the vacation home of friend William Stamps
Farish III, a 49-year-old multimillionaire who made his fortune in
the oil business. The home is located in the exclusive community of
Gulf Stream near Delray Beach.
   Bush was accompanied by his press spokesman Steve Hart and two
other aides, but none of his transition or campaign advisers.
However, the president-elect was expected to conduct some business
by telephone and told reporters Wednesday that he would spend time
considering cabinet appointments.
   But aides insisted that this vacation was intended for rest and
relaxation after a grueling campaign.
   ``He's very interested in relaxation time,'' Hart said.
   Bush brought his fishing pole and golf clubs along and told
reporters earlier he intended to do some surf fishing and fly
fishing.
   Bush also enjoys jogging and tennis. But Hart told reporters not
to expect much in the way of reports or photo opportunities of the
president-elect's activities.
   On Thursday, Bush met with President Reagan and the Cabinet and
attended the president's briefings with his national security
adviser and his chief of staff.
   At the cabinet meeting, Bush and Reagan received warm applause as
they entered together. Reagan, however, reminded his department
heads, ``We are still in charge until Jan. 20 and are still
responsible for making decisions of the government.''
   The president asked the appointed members of his administration
to submit their resignations to smooth the way for Bush to select
his own team.
   Bush also met Thursday with leaders of an organization of
Afghanistan rebels, Hart said.
   Bush told the chairman of the Afghan Alliance, Burhannudin
Rabbani, that he would support their efforts toward total withdrawal
of Soviet troops and self-determination, but did not pledge any
specific monetary or other support, according to Hart.

   Debt relief and the future of U.S.
military bases will top Manila's agenda with George Bush but
suspicions remain about the president-elect because of his past
support for Ferdinand Marcos.
   Also, President Corazon Aquino is a friend of defeated
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis from the years when she and
her late husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., lived in the Boston suburb of
Newton.
   Filipino politicians and influential political commentators made
no secret of their belief that the Massachusetts governor would have
been more sympathetic to Philippine interests, especially from the
daunting $28 billion foreign debt inherited from ousted President
Marcos.
   But Mrs. Aquino said she looked forward to working with Bush and
his new administration.
   ``I think that for my part, I can work with President Bush, with
the Bush administration, and I hope that he has seen what we have
done here as far as restoration of democracy is concerned,'' she
said.
   Bush's image in Manila has been largely defined by remarks during
a visit to the Philippines in 1981. During a dinner speech, the vice
president effusively praised Marcos for his ``adherence to
democratic principles.''
   Bush is widely perceived as one of the last major figures in the
Reagan administration to abandon Marcos before he fled to Hawaii in
the February 1986 popular uprising that toppled his 20-year
administration and propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
   As a sign of that suspicion, numerous commentators have
speculated that Bush may quash racketeering indictments in New York
City against Marcos and his wife Imelda.
   ``The Aquino camp is reported worried about the fact that
President-elect Bush, like outgoing President Reagan, is close to
the exiled Marcos couple in Hawaii,'' wrote columnist Ariel Bocobo
in The Manila Standard.
   ``Speculation in local political circles goes that Reagan, or
eventually Bush himself, may call off all indictments against the
Marcoses in the U.S. and give them a presidential pardon.''
   U.S. diplomats in Manila have repeatedly sought to assure the
Filipino public that judicial moves against Marcos will not be
influenced by politics and that Washington's support for Mrs. Aquino
is bipartisan.
   U.S. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Filipino
suspicions of Bush would be mollified if the new administration
makes good on President Reagan's promise last month of a
multinational aid package for the country's sluggish economy.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus told reporters that prospects
for such a plan may have brightened since Bush has promised to
continue Reagan foreign policy.
   Commentator Amando Doronila said Bush's naming of former Treasury
Secretary James Baker as his new secretary of state indicates ``a
closer integration of the Third World debt issue in the conduct of
U.S. foreign policy.''
   Doronila, writing in The Manila Chronicle, noted Baker, as
treasury secretary, authored the ``Baker Plan'' for U.S. policy
regarding Third World debt. The plan called for restructuring
interest payments and providing new loans for debt servicing,
something Manila has sought from creditor banks.
   Philippine debt is politically entwined with the contentious
issue of the six U.S. military bases, the keystone to American
military power in the Western Pacific.
   The lease on those installations, including Clark Air Base and
the Subic Bay naval base, expires in September 1991. Any extension
must be under a formal treaty ratified by two-thirds of the
23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases is strong.
   U.S. diplomats say they would like to begin preliminary talks on
a new treaty by mid-1989, to allow time for negotiations and for
ratification by both nations' senates by the 1991 deadline.
   A recent review of the current agreement took nearly seven months
to complete, and U.S. diplomats believe negotiations on an entirely
new treaty could drag for more than a year.
   A recent public opinion survey by Ateneo University found about
75 percent of the 1,200 respondents favored retaining the bases.
   But opposition is strong among small but influential groups in
the intelligentsia and the media. Diplomats believe those groups
could sway public opinion away from the bases if Washington's moves
on debt relief and other issues disappoint Filipinos.
   ``Bush may only make America's domination of our country, its
officials bullying ours, more obvious,'' wrote the nationally
circulated newspaper Malaya. ``Americans and their presidents are
expected always to look only after their own interests. It behooves
us to look only after ours.''

   Fifty-six years later, Albert Furrer is
finally the last man of The Last Man's Club.
   The 96-year-old civic leader today will get that bottle of Mumm's
champagne the club bought after the 32 World War I veterans reunited
in 1932 and decided they would get together every Veterans Day.
   ``What else can I say but that I'm here until the end,'' Furrer
said Thursday from his bed at Brookside Hospital, where he had a
malignant growth removed this week.
   ``I came through floods, fires, wars ... my God, you come through
it all, and I don't know if it's an honor or a sort of curse,''
added Furrer, who lives in a nearby nursing home.
   ``It's rough to see all your friends die off. Old people don't
make many new friends.''
   The champagne bottle, encased in a decorative mahogany box, is in
the hands of the family of the club's former secretary-treasurer,
Victor Parachini, who died in February at age 89. For the past four
years, he and Furrer had been the club's only surviving members. The
bottle is signed by the club's original 32.
   After all these years, the champagne is mostly a symbolic trophy,
having gone sour. A new bottle will accompany it so Furrer can hold
the club's final celebration today, Veterans Day, which was called
Armistice Day before 1954.
   The Last Man's Club was modeled after similar efforts by
Revolutionary War veterans to maintain camaraderie, said Furrer. Its
members all came from Contra Costa County, across the Bay from San
Francisco.
   The club's name was derived from the members' intention to leave
a sizable endowment to the last surviving member through annual
dues. At one point, its coffers held $30,000.
   But the money was spent on the Veterans Day parties and on
helping members who had fallen on hard times, and the fund dried up
about five years ago.
   ``They were all the kind of fellas you'd be proud to be
associated with,'' Furrer recalled. ``It was a great thing when we
were all together. It was the kind of deal where we all helped each
other.''
   Furrer, who ran a stationery store for most of his life and
served on numerous community boards, remembers the annual club
parties as classy evenings of entertainment and food.
   Besides those affairs, members attended funerals of deceased
members.
   The one thing club members never did was talk about the war, said
Furrer, explaining that the group didn't want to relive their
wartime experiences despite their desire to stay in touch.
   Betty Maffei of the Contra Costa County Historical Society will
put the Mumm's on display in nearby Pleasant Hill after today's
celebration and keep it for posterity.
   ``I don't think it's exactly an honor to be `The Last Man,'''
said Maffei. ``It's something they all laughed about back then, but
as the day got closer, I think the survivors stopped laughing as
they realized they might be that guy.''
   Furrer had no tips to offer on how to live a long life.
   ``God only knows how I made it,'' he said, laughing. ``I never
abused myself, but I didn't lead a holy life, either.''

   FBI Director William Sessions says the agency
expects to finish within a few weeks the first phase of a criminal
investigation of the computer ``virus'' that attacked and disabled
computer networks nationwide last week.
   Sessions said Thursay the bureau is examining a wide range of
possible criminal violations.
   A 23-year-old Cornell University graduate student has told
friends he created the virus, a tiny program that spreads throughout
computer networks and disrupts them.
   Sessions, however, told reporters ``there has to be a very
careful and deliberate look at it before I would ever go out and
suggest that a person had actually committed a crime.''
   ``You have to move carefully, and I think we've done it properly
in this case,'' he added.
   Sessions said investigators are trying to determine whether
statutes concerning wire fraud, malicious mischief or unlawful
access to stored communications may have been broken.
   Earlier this week, the FBI said it was focusing on a federal law
that prohibits fraud or related activity in connection with
computers, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
   Cornell student Robert T. Morris Jr. has told friends that he
created the computer virus that disabled thousands of computers last
week, but didn't intend for it to spread as it did.
   ``We often look at intent as being knowing and intentional doing
of an act which the law forbids and knowing that the law forbids it
to be done,'' Sessions said. ``But we also have other statutes which
deal simply with knowingly doing something.''
   The malicious-mischief statute to which Sessions referred carries
a maximum 10-year prison term for anyone who willfully interferes
with the use of any communications line controlled by the U.S.
government.
   The unlawful-access law makes it a crime to prevent authorized
access to electronic communications while they are in electronic
storage. It carries a maximum six-month jail term if malicious
destruction or damage is not involved. The virus incapacitated
computer systems, leaving their owners unable to gain access to data
stored in them.
   On another subject at a news conference, Sessions said the FBI is
examining allegations by some Hispanic FBI agents that they have
been targets of retaliation within the bureau for testifying in a
class-action suit alleging harassment of Hispanic agents.
   He said ``we are looking at'' the allegations, which are now part
of the suit pending in U.S. District Court in El Paso, Texas.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Bone marrow cells can become a ``reservoir of
infection'' for AIDS that may spread the disease to other parts of
the body, a new study shows.
   Thomas M. Folks, head of a virology laboratory at the federal
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said Thursday the finding
confirms that the AIDS virus is able to infect and reproduce within
stem cells _ immature cells that grow in the bone marrow and develop
into components of the blood.
   ``This is probably a cell that helps set up the reservoir of
infection and allows the disease to become chronic and linger for a
long period of time,'' Folks said in a telephone interview.
   Folks said he and a team of researchers used a new technique to
purify stem cells from bone marrow extracted from a cadaver. The
stem cells then were exposed to human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, that causes AIDS, and then cultured in test tubes.
   ``After 40 or 50 days, the cells in the culture became packed
with HIV virus,'' Folks said. ``The cells became bags of virus.''
   The infected cells developed into macrophages, a type of cell
that fights disease by engulfing and digesting bacteria or other
infective agents.
   Folks said for people infected with AIDS, macrophages may develop
into ``bags of virus'' that actually can spread the infection to
other parts of the body.

<HEAD>House Leaders Back Gonzalez for Committee Chairmanship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, has won the
backing of House Speaker Jim Wright and other Democratic leaders for
the chairmanship of the House Banking Committee.
   The endorsement all but guarantees that the 72-year-old Gonzalez,
a 27-year veteran of Congress from San Antonio, will take over the
committee at a critical time: during the debate over a taxpayer
bailout of the fund that insures the nation's savings institutions.
   The current chairman, Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., lost
his re-election bid Tuesday after his opponent made a campaign issue
out of Justice Department allegations that St Germain accepted
thousands of dollars in entertainment from savings industry
lobbyists.
   Wright, at a news conference, said Democratic leaders met
Thursday afternoon and unanimously decided to support Gonzalez as St
Germain's replacement when the House Democratic Caucus meets on Dec.
6.
   Others at the leadership meeting were House Majority Leader
Thomas S. Foley of Washington, Majority Whip Tony Coelho of
California, Deputy Whip David E. Bonior of Michigan, Beryl Anthony
Jr. of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee; Budget Committee Chairman William Gray of Pennsylvania
and Democratic Caucus Secretary Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio.
   Ms. Oakar is also a member of the Banking Committee and had been
mentioned as a possible alternative to Gonzalez.

<HEAD>President OKs Back Benefits for Man Who Joined WWII Navy at Age 12</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A World War II veteran injured at Guadalcanal
will be given the disability benefits he was denied by the Navy
because he lied about his age when he enlisted at age 12, under a
bill signed by President Reagan.
   Reagan said Calvin L. Graham ``is a veteran of Navy and Marine
Corps service who has honorably served his country.''
   The act provides that dental injuries Graham suffered at the
Battle of Guadalcanal will be considered a permanent
service-connected disability incurred in the line of duty. It also
provides for reimbursement for costs for treatment.
   The measure also grants Graham a lump-sum payment of $4,917 in
back pay for the period from Sept. 17, 1942, to April 5, 1943, when
the Navy discovered his age and he was mustered out. He'll also get
mustering out pay and interest.
   Graham was aboard the USS South Dakota when shrapnel ripped
through his mouth. He contended he lost all his teeth, but was
denied mustering out benefits and was granted disability status for
only one tooth.
   The legislation gives him $18,000 for his mouth injury, in
addition to the mustering out and back pay.

<TEXT>
   As a 10-year-old Jewish boy, Eric
Mayer watched Nazi henchmen destroy his home and loot family
treasures. The memory still haunts him a half-century later.
   ``I saw the synagogue burning. Our home was destroyed, and books
and precious family heirlooms were thrown out the window,
desecrated,'' Mayer said of the night of Nazi terror 50 years ago in
his hometown Worms.
   Sitting Thursday in the reconstructed synagogue, Mayer said, ``I
remember that night as if it were yesterday.''
   Mayer, of Wayne, N.J., was visiting his birthplace along with 40
other members of the New York-based International Memorial Committee
for Jewish Victims of Nazism.
   The occasion for the visit, which included several Worms-born
Jews from America, was to mark the anniversary of the Kristallnacht
pogrom of Nov. 9-10, 1938. Worms is 35 miles southwest of Frankfurt.
   On that night, Nazi thugs destroyed hundreds of synagogues,
thousands of Jewish homes and businesses, and sent 30,000 Jews to
concentration camps. Ninety-one Jews were killed.
   ``The next morning, my mother, brother, sister, aunt, grandfather
and I were sent to a jail with no facilities. About 70 people were
crammed into a small room,'' Mayer told The Associated Press.
   ``It was called `protective custody' to protect us from the
German people, who were supposedly `rightfully' angry at us,'' Mayer
said in English.
   His father was sent to Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald, and
neither he nor Mayer's mother survived the Holocaust. Their names
are now on a plaque in the synagogue, along with other Jews from
Worms who were systematically murdered.
   Mayer later fled to France and eventually the United States. He
said he has since visited Worms and other West German cities many
times, often because of his work as a business consultant.
   Before the Holocaust, Worms had a rich Jewish tradition dating to
the Middle Ages.
   The 11th-century synagogue and adjoining mikvah, or ritual bath,
draws tourists from across the country. A small Jewish museum has
been built next to the synagogue and the complex is on a street of
old houses preserved from the neighborhood's long era as a Jewish
quarter.
   But Worms' Jewish population was nearly wiped out during the
Third Reich. City officials say only one or two Jews are living in
Worms today, compared to a pre-Nazi Jewish population of about 1,100.
   Committee president Gerhard Spies, 72, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., lost
numerous relatives during the Nazi period. He said his father, a
president of Worms' former Jewish Community, was ``a broken man''
after internment in Buchenwald.
   One important goal of the committee's visits to Worms, Spies
said, was to talk to West German youth.
   ``I have made peace with myself, and when I come here I visit
schools and talk to young people. I tell them what a Jew is, what he
thinks about different things, and exchange viewpoints,'' Spies said.
   Spies said he has been disappointed by most young people's lack
of knowledge about Jews.
   ``This may be changing now, but even two years ago I found a lack
of understanding in many issues concerning Israel and Judaism. Even
the teachers themselves were sometimes misinformed,'' Spies said.
   Another committee member said the situation among youth is
changing for the better.
   ``There's been a definite change, an improvement as time goes
on,'' said Henry R. Huttenbach, a history professor from Brooklyn,
N.Y. ``They're asking questions, healthy questions. The dialogue
shows a larger number of concerned kids.''
   The committee has participated with the city of Worms in several
events marking Kristallnacht and similar events throughout West
Germany. But few seemed to think it will have a lasting effect.
   ``The extravaganza on national television served the politicians,
but it isn't the quiet, patient work needed at the community
level,'' Huttenbach said.

<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ Leroy Bishop spent 20 years wondering
what happened to his best buddy from 'Nam. At one point, Bishop
heard John Farruggio had died.
   His wondering ended this year when, using a new computer data
base being compiled by the Veterans of the Vietnam War, Bishop
learned his Army friend lived only six miles away in a Philadelphia
suburb.
   ``We got a little bit heavier and a little bit grayer. He's still
the same guy,'' said Bishop, a printer who lives in Levittown.
   Find-A-Vet, as the program is called, allows veterans to look for
those they knew in Vietnam, even if all they remember is a nickname
or a military unit.
   Michael Milne, executive director of the Veterans of the Vietnam
War, said society's acceptance of Vietnam vets in the last few years
has led to an increased number of veterans wanting to find lost
acquaintances.
   ``It's a healing process,'' said Milne, who runs the national
organization from his home just outside Wilkes-Barre in northeastern
Pennsylvania.
   Find-A-Vet has a computer data base with more than 3,000 names on
it and can also search for names among the organization's 32,000
members, Milne said.
   Veterans of the Vietnam War has tried to increase the size of the
data base by putting fliers for the program in its newsletter and at
Veterans Administration Hospitals.
   Only Vietnam veterans are allowed to use Find-A-Vet, and to ask
for a search, vets must enter their biographical information into
the system. A $1 donation is requested for each search.
   If several people fit the description, the Veterans of the
Vietnam War sends a list of names and addresses. If no one meets the
description, they hold the request for three months and try it again.
   More than 400 requests have been made since the service started
in January, Milne said.
   John Sepcoski Jr., coordinator for Find-A-Vet, said he hopes the
program eventually has 1 million names in the computer data base. A
total of 2.6 million soldiers from all services were in Vietnam.
   Bishop and Farruggio saw combat together in Vietnam's central
highlands.
   ``We had so many good times and bad times,'' said Bishop, who
tried over the years to find his friend but hadn't a clue as to his
whereabouts until he asked for a search in the Find-A-Vet program.
Last fall, he learned that Farruggio lived in nearby Newtown.
   ``I called him. I said, `Do you know who this is? It's Bish.' He
just couldn't believe it was me,'' Bishop recalled.
   When they got together, they first swapped humorous anecdotes,
such as the time when Farruggio's rucksack caught in a tree during a
firefight and he couldn't jump for cover.
   Then, Bishop said, they talked about things he hadn't even
discussed with his wife.
   ``You can't really talk about it to anybody unless they've been
there,'' Bishop said, adding that he and Farruggio now get together
every week or so.
   Ronald Green, who runs a Vietnam Veterans Outreach Center in
Philadelphia, said a meeting between Vietnam buddies can help them
psychologically.
   ``It can be positive, finally, discarding the old emotional
baggage,'' said Green, an Army veteran who served in West Germany.
   ``After 15 or 20 years, they start thinking about people who were
instrumental in their survival,'' Green added.
   Director Milne, who served as an Army Ranger in the Mekong Delta
from 1967-69, had the idea for the program and enlisted the help of
Sepcoski, who was a student at nearby King's College at the time.
   Unlike World War II, Milne said, most soldiers in Vietnam were
sent over as individuals for one-year enlistments.
   ``One of the things everybody failed to do was swap names,
addresses and phone numbers. When you rotated out, you just rotated
out,'' Milne said.
   Milne, too, has been trying to find a lost friend, his first
sergeant from Vietnam.
   ``He was a hoot and holler. He was a confidant. He was a good
friend,'' Milne said.

   Bernard Akana spent only $1,323 on his
campaign for mayor of Hawaii County to his incumbent opponent's
$100,000, made no speeches and was so obscure some media
organizations couldn't get his name right.
   He won, of course. His campaign secret: sitting in a Hilo
shopping mall and chatting with voters.
   Akana, a 69-year-old Republican, had no endorsements, no campaign
workers and nine back-to-back defeats in county and state elections
between 1968 and 1984. His only campaign adviser was his wife, Ina,
who ran for office herself in 1986.
   Two weeks before the election, he told reporters he knew little
about budgeting for the county that constitutes the island of
Hawaii, taxes and housing programs and that he had little interest
in those matters.
   On Tuesday, the retired electric company worker edged incumbent
Democrat Dante Carpenter by 19,886 votes to 19,088.
   Carpenter had been criticized for what some voters considered an
arrogant style, as well as for his support of island development and
because he paid his wife $15,500 to administer a campaign survey.
The poll was scrapped and the money returned after the payment was
disclosed.
   Akana said he wants ``honest-to-God affordable housing, the 911
(emergency telephone) system, a Kona municipal golf course,
transportation, traffic safety, drug control, equal opportunity for
the handicapped and a bayfront beach park.''
   Not bad for a candidate who just a few days ago was so obscure a
Honolulu newspaper called him Benjamin Akana, a television reporter
on election night referred to him as Akuna and a Hilo radio
announcer Wednesday kept calling him Akaka.

   Fifty-six years later, Albert Furrer is
finally the last man of The Last Man's Club.
   The 96-year-old civic leader today will get that bottle of Mumm's
champagne the club bought after the 32 World War I veterans reunited
in 1932 and decided they would get together every Veterans Day.
   ``What else can I say but that I'm here until the end,'' Furrer
said Thursday from his bed at Brookside Hospital, where he had a
malignant growth removed this week.
   ``I came through floods, fires, wars ... my God, you come through
it all, and I don't know if it's an honor or a sort of curse,''
added Furrer, who lives in a nearby nursing home.
   ``It's rough to see all your friends die off. Old people don't
make many new friends.''
   The champagne bottle, encased in a decorative mahogany box, is in
the hands of the family of the club's former secretary-treasurer,
Victor Parachini, who died in February at age 89. For the past four
years, he and Furrer had been the club's only surviving members. The
bottle is signed by the club's original 32.
   After all these years, the champagne is mostly a symbolic trophy,
having gone sour. A new bottle will accompany it so Furrer can hold
the club's final celebration today, Veterans Day, which was called
Armistice Day before 1954.
   The Last Man's Club was modeled after similar efforts by
Revolutionary War veterans to maintain camaraderie, said Furrer. Its
members all came from Contra Costa County, across the Bay from San
Francisco.
   The club's name was derived from the members' intention to leave
a sizable endowment to the last surviving member through annual
dues. At one point, its coffers held $30,000.
   But the money was spent on the Veterans Day parties and on
helping members who had fallen on hard times, and the fund dried up
about five years ago.
   ``They were all the kind of fellas you'd be proud to be
associated with,'' Furrer recalled. ``It was a great thing when we
were all together. It was the kind of deal where we all helped each
other.''
   Furrer, who ran a stationery store for most of his life and
served on numerous community boards, remembers the annual club
parties as classy evenings of entertainment and food.
   Besides those affairs, members attended funerals of deceased
members.
   The one thing club members never did was talk about the war, said
Furrer, explaining that the group didn't want to relive their
wartime experiences despite their desire to stay in touch.
   Betty Maffei of the Contra Costa County Historical Society will
put the Mumm's on display in nearby Pleasant Hill after today's
celebration and keep it for posterity.
   ``I don't think it's exactly an honor to be `The Last Man,'''
said Maffei. ``It's something they all laughed about back then, but
as the day got closer, I think the survivors stopped laughing as
they realized they might be that guy.''
   Furrer had no tips to offer on how to live a long life.
   ``God only knows how I made it,'' he said, laughing. ``I never
abused myself, but I didn't lead a holy life, either.''

   Share prices soared today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, pushing its main price index to a new high while the U.S.
dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the most widely
followed price index of the exchange, gained 323.15 points, or 1.15
percent, to close at 28,489.57.
   The dollar closed at 123.70 yen, after opening at 123.80 yen and
moving in a range of 123.63-123.88 yen. Thursday's close was 124.10
yen.
   Securities dealers said the Nikkei index's strong showing was a
reflection of bullish sentiment prevailing in the market.
   ``There is no outstanding factor which is pushing share prices
up,'' said Keiichi Nishida, a dealer at Kidder Peabody's Tokyo
office. ``Most investors are feeling it is about time share prices
should start picking up. I think we can say the market is turning
bullish.''
   Nishida said the strong performance of financial and food shares
ignited the market bullishness across the board.
   In the currency market, dealers said general sentiment toward the
dollar remained bearish, but investor anxiety about intervention by
the Bank of Japan was holding up the currency.
   ``It is unlikely that the dollar will go below 123.50 today
because the Bank of Japan is likely to intervene,'' said an exchange
dealer at a U.S. bank in Tokyo.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly has been buying dollars
intermittently in recent sessions to help keep the currency from
falling further.

<HEAD>Poison Probably Killed Former Battalion Head, Source Says</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Poison probably killed a Haitian
military leader who died after eating a bowl of soup, a
well-informed medical source said.
   Local radio initially reported Col. Jean-Claude Paul, forced to
step down after a coup in September, died Sunday of a heart attack
but family friends felt he had been poisoned, and police sources
termed the death suspicious.
   ``The cause of death is definitely not a heart attack,'' the
reliable medical source told The Associated Press, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``The hypothesis that Paul was poisoned is
highly probable.''
   The source said Paul, 49, played soccer every day and was in
excellent physical form and ``superb'' health. The source did not
elaborate further.
   Paul was buried Thursday outside his home in Fermathe, a wealthy
hillside district.
   About 200 people, including family members and military officers,
attended the funeral at Sacre Coeur Roman Catholic church in
Port-au-Prince before a private burial at his residence, 10 miles
east of the capital.
   Paul's former wife, Mireille Delinois, his maid and gardener were
arrested Monday and remained in custody Thursday at Petionville
police headquarters. No charges have been filed.
   Col. Georges Valcin, the police chief, said they would be held
until an investigation of Paul's death is finished.
   Antonio Paul, a brother of the colonel, said Paul had convulsions
and died in his arms one hour after drinking a bowl of soup. Remains
of the soup were taken to a Miami laboratory for analysis.
   An autopsy was performed Monday at the Morgue of the State
University Hospital, but the results were not disclosed.
Unidentified military sources quoted by radio stations said Thursday
the findings would not be made public for at least one month.
   In March, Paul was indicted by a grand jury in Miami on drug
trafficking charges. Ms. Delinois, who was married to Paul twice and
is the mother of his 13-year-old son, was arrested in Miami last
year for drug possession and jumped bail.
   Federal authorities sought to put Paul on trial, but the United
States and Haiti have no extradition treaty.
   Paul was commander of the 700-man Dessalines Battalion, the most
brutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-man army, and was linked to the Tonton
Macoutes, the dreaded private police under the 29-year Duvalier
dictatorship.
   Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, fired Paul on
Sept. 30 in a purge of commanders who served under Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy. Avril replaced Namphy as president in a Sept. 17 coup led by
army officers demanding democratic reforms and an end to violence.
   Namphy came to power in February 1986 after Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled into exile in France.

<HEAD>Sultan Who Caused Riots To Be Installed After Order Restored</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nigerian officials say they will install a
Moslem sultan, whose appointment this week caused violent riots that
killed 10 people, when calm returns to the country.
   Col. Ahmed Daku, military governor of northwestern Sokoto State,
told reporters those disputing the selection of Ibrahim Dasuki to
succeed Sadiq Abubakar should take the matter to court.
   As sultan, Abubakar for 50 years led Nigeria's influential Moslem
community, numbering perhaps 50 million and making up 43 percent of
the population of Africa's most populous nation. He died Nov. 1 at
age 85.
   Thousands of people who wanted Abubakar to be succeeded by his
eldest son, Muhammadu Maccido, took to the streets in protest Monday
and set fire to several public buildings and a commercial bank.
   The official News Agency of Nigeria says Sokoto town has been
calm since Wednesday, although soldiers continue patrolling the
streets. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed Monday.
   Daku said he approved Dasuki's appointment after the nine-member
selection committee of Moslem elders, called kingmakers, ``had
deliberated on the aspirants to the sultanate and passed their
recommendations to the state Council of Chiefs.''
   But reporters in Lagos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
people in Sokoto believe the military government forced the
committee to choose Dasuki, instead of Abubakar's son.
   Radio Nigeria said the rioters burned several buildings,
including that of Rima Radio and the local branch of the
Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
   Dasuki is chairman of the bank's local board.
   Dasuki, a 65-year-old millionaire and former civil servant, has
urged people to remain calm.
   Traditionally, the sultan in Sokoto also is revered by Moslems in
neighboring countries and frequently is consulted by Nigerian
politicians, including those of the other dominant Christian and
animist faiths.

   Eighty-five diners briefly became trapped in
the city's highest restaurant when a small electrical fire knocked
out elevator service, officials said.
   The 30th-floor fire in the downtown Transamerica Tower caused
$150,000 damage Thursday night. It was quickly put out by
firefighters using hand-held extinguishers.
   Diners in the fashionable Tower restaurant on the 32nd floor were
in no immediate danger, said Fire Division Cmdr. David Sloan.
   Last May, a spectacular high-rise fire in Los Angeles' First
Interstate Bank building left one dead and dozens injured. A smaller
fire hit an upper floor of the Transamerica tower in the late 1970s.

<HEAD>Other States Will Follow California Insurance Revolt, Activists
Predict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRED BAYLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade ago, California spurred a nationwide tax revolt with a
ballot question that slashed rates. Now activists are proclaiming
the birth of another West Coast-inspired citizens movement: the
insurance revolt.
   ``The message from California voters is `Enough is enough,'''
said consumer activist Ralph Nader of Proposition 103, a ballot
measure that cut insurance rates. ``Now we're getting calls from
other states and other groups interested in doing the same thing.''
   It is a prospect that insurance industry officials don't relish,
especially since rebellious rumblings have already been felt in the
New Jersey and Massachusetts legislatures.
   ``California is known in our business as a bellwether state,''
said Ron Howorth, a vice president with the National Association of
Independent Insurers. ``It has always had the position of a
trendsetter and that concerns us.''
   Proposition 103, which was narrowly approved Tuesday, requires
all insurance companies writing car, home and business policies in
the state to roll back rates to 1987 levels and then cut premiums by
20 percent.
   California's Proposition 13, approved by voters in 1978, cut
local property taxes in half. The initiative set off a tax revolt
that led to similar propositions in other states.
   In approving Proposition 103, voters rejected other ballot
initiatives offered by legislators, trial lawyers and the insurance
industry, all of whom spent about $76 million to sell their plan as
the solution to the state's skyrocketing car insurance rates.
   Insurance industry officials say Proposition 103 offers no way
for insurers to cut their costs and will force some companies out of
business. Other insurers are contemplating limiting their business
in California.
   The state Supreme Court delayed the proposition's implementation
Thursday at the request of insurance companies to give the court
time to consider whether the measure is constitutional.
   ``I certainly hope for the benefit of other states that they
don't follow California's lead,'' said George Tye, executive manager
for the Association of California Insurance Companies. ``It was a
totally irresponsible and destructive initiative.''
   Yet industry officials admit the time is ripe for car insurance
to become an issue in many of the nation's big cities, where car
thefts, insurance fraud, automobile costs and auto repair and
litigation resulting from accidents have sent insurance rates
soaring.
   Some even admit the industry brought Proposition 103 on itself.
   ``Whenever a solution was offered that harmed the insurance
industry, the insurance industry was very good at blocking the
legislation,'' said Manuel Valencia, a spokesman for Proposition
104, the California insurance industry's defeated plan to offer some
rate relief.
   Concern over insurance rates has spurred action elsewhere:
   _Florida voters rejected a ballot question Tuesday that would
have set a $100,000 ceiling on certain personal injury lawsuits. The
bill, supported by businesses and doctors, was aimed at reducing the
cost of liability and malpractice insurance.
   _Pennsylvania consumers grumbled loudly last month when state
officials voted to triple _ to $24 _ a special assessment on car
insurance policies. So loud was the outcry that the increase was
delayed, and legislation was introduced to deal with insurance
problems.
   _In Arizona, a special legislative panel will hold hearings next
month to find ways to cut car insurance costs, now the fifth highest
in the nation.
   _Teachers in several Kentucky cities marched out of class to
protest their higher medical costs under the state's new
self-insurance program. The state went to self-insurance after
insurers demanded an increase in premiums.
   _New Jersey, which had the highest rates in the nation, was able
to offer modest rate cuts with legislation passed last month that
allows drivers to buy less expensive policies with greater
deductibles.
   _Last week, Massachusetts, No. 1 in the nation in the rate of
claims, passed similar legislation to reduce insurance rates.
Officials said the impetus came after the drivers were hit by
retroactive rate increases.
   ``We were not having any success until then,'' said Paula Gold,
Massachusetts' secretary of consumer affairs. ``The consumers became
outraged and really let the legislators know it.''
   Industry officials say the California vote is likely to get
insurers moving in the direction of reform.
   ``They are in a mood to go back to the table and work something
out,'' said Howorth. ``This thing in California will only encourage
us to work with the lawyers, legislators and consumer groups.''
   But Nader thinks the movement toward compromise may be too late.
   ``What happened in California is going to encourage the people to
apply a little law and order on the insurance industry by
themselves,'' he said.

<HEAD>NATO Pledges To Help Investigate Italian Jetliner Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO has offered to help investigate the mysterious
1980 crash of an Italian jetliner that killed all 81 aboard.
   State Italian television has reported the Itavia DC-9 was
accidentally shot down with a missile fired by a warplane from a
NATO country, perhaps Italy. The accident occurred June 27, 1980.
   ``I can confirm that there was no NATO exercise in the area
between May 16 and Sept. 27, 1980,'' NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner said Thursday. ``We will do anything we can which could help
in the investigation. NATO has nothing to hide. If requested, we
will give any assistance, any support.''
   On Wednesday, Premier Ciriaco de Mita ordered a government
investigation. Speaking to parliament Thursday, Defense Minister
Valerio Zanone again rejected reports that an Italian fighter jet
may have downed the plane.
   Woerner said De Mita requested NATO assistance during a meeting
Thursday and that he assured the premier that NATO would cooperate.
   Woerner, a former West German defense minister who became NATO
secretary-general on July 1, also met Thursday with President
Francesco Cossiga, Zanone and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti.
   Repeating previous assurances, Zanone told parliament there were
no Italian warplanes in the area on the day of the accident and that
there were no Italian military excercises there.

   Neil Bush, son of president-elect George Bush, has
been called to testify about his role as an officer of an insolvent
Colorado savings and loan in a suit filed by homeowners.
   Bush wasn't named as a defendant in the lawsuit but he served as
a director of Silverado Banking Savings and Loan, which made loans
to The Township, a financially-troubled, 82-unit townhouse project
in suburban Denver.
   Four homeowners sued Silverado last year, alleging they should
have been told when they bought their homes in 1985 that Silverado
was preparing to foreclose on the developer, Meridian Land Corp.
   The homeowners also allege that Silverado exercised substantial
control over the project, which is only half finished, and that
Township units suffer from a number of construction problems.
   Bush was a director of Silverado for three years, but stepped
down in August, citing a potential conflict of interest with his
father's presidential campaign.
   Silverado reported a $245 million loss on real estate loans the
same month.
   Chuck Torres, attorney for the Township homeowners, said he wants
Bush to explain Silverado's ``policy of making high-risk loans.''
   He said Silverado's lending practices led his clients to invest
in ``a financially unsound development.''
   Jim Nesland, attorney for Bush, said the Denver oilman will
answer questions, but he added the subpoena amounts to
``harassment.''

<HEAD>Security Firm Of Former Watergate Burglar Files For Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The security firm run by former Nixon aide and
convicted Watergate burglar G. Gordon Liddy has filed a Chapter 11
bankruptcy petition seeking protection from creditors.
   International Security & Intelligence Inc., doing business as G.
Gordon Liddy & Associates, claimed ``certain business reversals and
a severe cash flow crisis'' in a petition filed in federal court
here Tuesday.
   Founded by Liddy two years ago, the firm provides armed guard
services to customers, with about 140 guards in the South Florida
area. It also employed an anti-terrorist team called ``Hurricane
Force,'' which Liddy said was available to rescue kidnapped company
executives.
   The Miami-based company, which listed $363,000 in assets and
$747,000 in liabilities, asked the court to allow it to pay a
$40,000 payroll owed employees.
   On Thursday, a bankruptcy court judge agreed to let the firm use
cash for 30 days, with a final hearing tentatively set for Dec. 8.
   International Security said creditors claim they are owed almost
$1 million. The firm disputes some of the debt, including about
$200,000 stemming from a recently failed merger attempt with Walnut
Capital Corp., of Chicago.
   According to the bankruptcy claim, International Security does
not dispute that it owes $278,300, to the Internal Revenue Service.
   Liddy, who was general counsel to President Richard Nixon's
re-election campaign, served 52 months in federal prison for the
1972 break-in at Democratic Party headquarters in Washington, D.C.
He had been hired by former Attorney General John Mitchell, who died
on Wednesday.
   In addition to the security firm, Liddy also runs a polygraph
testing company and has been a frequent speaker on college campuses.

   Three workers killed in an explosion while
checking gas levels in a sewer tunnel were acting as guinea pigs,
says a safety advocate who calls the project's fatality rate the
nation's worst per dollar spent.
   ``I'm absolutely convinced that this particular tragedy is
inexcusable and absolutely avoidable,'' Joseph Kinney, executive
director of the National Safe Workplace Institute in Chicago, said
of Thursday's accident. ``It did not need to happen.''
   A city official defended safety procedures, and said
investigators did not know what triggered the blast.
   In all, six workers have died since 1986 in the $2.1 billion
deep-tunnel sewer project, the largest public works project in
Wisconsin history. Last March, the federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration cited the contractor for inadequate
ventilation.
   The explosion occurred around 9 a.m. after the three went into
the tunnel to check a high level of methane, a gas formed by natural
decomposition, officials said. The methane had caused workers to
evacuate.
   Rescue workers, who had to clear explosive fumes and remove
twisted wreckage while contending with poor lighting and knee-deep
mud, took eight hours to remove the bodies.
   ``It was a mess,'' said fire Capt. Bert Bemann. ``It was like
hell.''
   The victims were identified as Ronald Kohne, 49, a tunnel
superintendent from Big Sandy, Tenn.; Rick Sochacki, 34, a safety
officer from South Holland, Ill.; and Tony Bell, 25, of Sturgeon
Bay, a shift foreman.
   Autopsies were scheduled for today to determine what killed the
men. District Attorney E. Michael McCann began an investigation,
saying the number of deaths on the project had concerned him
earlier. OSHA also sent an investigator to the site.
   ``It seems to me that the three men were the modern-day
equivalent to canaries in cages in the old coal mines,'' said
Kinney, referring to the old practice of using canaries to check for
lethal gas levels in coal mines. If a canary died, the miner knew to
get out.
   Kinney questioned why remote-controlled monitoring equipment
could not have been used instead of sending the men back into the
tunnel after a methane problem had already caused workers to
evacuate it.
   Kinney said the project has the worst death rate per dollar spent
of any such waste water or heavy construction project in the nation.
His non-profit institute, which is funded by foundation grants and
contributions, compiles statistics on workplace safety.
   But Shelia Payton, chairwoman of the Milwaukee Metropolitan
Sewage District, defended the project's safety policies.
   ``These were inspectors. These were trained people,'' Payton
said. ``They went in there with the proper equipment to check the
gas levels.''
   The connector tunnel is to carry water into a deep tunnel
designed to serve as an underground reservoir for sewage at times of
high flow and to prevent overloading of district sewage treatment
facilities.
   Payton said sensors on a drilling machine initially detected a
pocket of methane. The work crew was evacuated and the tunnel was
ventilated. After 15 minutes, the three men went in with detectors
to see if work could resume.
   ``Everything went according to the procedures that had been laid
out beforehand,'' she said.
   Payton said officials would adjust procedures to prevent a
recurrence once they determined the explosion's cause.
   S.A. Healy Co. of McCook, Ill., the connector tunnel contractor,
has a good safety record, she said.
   However, OSHA spokesman Gerald Cunningham said his agency fined
the company $620 for inadequate ventilation in part of a tunnel last
March. That violation and lesser ones were immediately corrected,
Cunningham said.
   None of the three previous deaths on the project involved gas.
One worker fell in an air shaft, another was hit by a falling rock
and the third was crushed in a conveyor system.
   The 11-year project, which is about half completed, is the result
of a federal lawsuit by Illinois over the occasional flow of raw
sewage into Lake Michigan when Milwaukee's treatment plants become
overloaded by heavy rainfall.
   Payton said the project is critical to protecting the
metropolitan area's water quality. ``This project must go on,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Mack Claims Senate Seat; Democrats Plan Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack III was making
plans for his transition to the Senate today as Rep. Kenneth
``Buddy'' MacKay and Democratic Party officials considered a legal
challenge to Mack's narrow victory.
   MacKay refused to concede Thursday even after absentee ballots
gave Mack a clear victory, saying he and his attorneys were
discussing voting ``irregularities'' that he might challenge.
   Mack's victory decided the last of this year's 33 Senate races.
It means the Democrats will have a 55-45 majority, a gain of one
seat, in the new Senate.
   Mack, who replaces retiring three-term Democratic Sen. Lawton
Chiles, declared himself the winner when the absentee votes were
announced.
   ``It's very exciting,'' said the 48-year-old grandson of the
Baseball Hall of Fame manager. ``It's been long; it's been tough.
But I felt all along that my message of more freedom, free markets,
freedom from taxes, freedom as an objective of our foreign policy,
would come through clearly.''
   President Reagan, who did a television satellite feed for Mack's
campaign Monday, called the Cape Coral congressman to congratulate
him.
   The AP's latest tally showed Mack with 2,044,575 votes, or 50
percent, to MacKay's 2,014,924 votes, also 50 percent. That gave
Mack a margin of nearly 30,000 votes, more than enough to avoid an
automatic recount that would be triggered if the difference was less
than one-half of 1 percent. About 5,000 absentee votes still were
out in Bay County, a Mack stronghold in the Panhandle.
   ``We may have to ask the `fat lady' for an encore,'' said MacKay
campaign manager Greg Farmer. ``Something's screwy with those
numbers.''
   MacKay, 55, estimated that up to 170,000 Senate votes may be
missing in the state's four largest counties. He said there were
more votes in those counties for the secretary of state and
insurance commissioner races than for the Senate.
   MacKay told reporters his lawyers would study possible challenges
to the vote, such as a court-ordered statewide recount or a manual
count of a random selection of ballots in the four counties.
   ``We don't intend to drag this out,'' he said at his Ocala home.
``I regret this has come up in this campaign, but I do feel that I
owe it to those people whose votes were not counted.''
   Farmer said the way races were listed on the ballots may have
confused voters in some counties, or there may have been computer
problems.
   ``There are some some irregularities out there right now we can't
explain right now,'' said state Democratic Party Chairman Charles
Whitehead. ``We've talked to some people who are very knowledgeable
in the way this is done who agree with us.''
   Mack said he wasn't worried about legal challenges, and he said
he wanted to ``reach out to Buddy MacKay.''
   ``Nobody should be put through what we've had to experience,''
Mack said. ``They ran a tough campaign and they've got to be
disappointed.''
   Mack also wasn't worried about relations with Democratic U.S.
Sen. Bob Graham, who during the campaign labeled Mack ``an
ideological wacko.''
   ``Bob is a professional and he's very good at what he does. I'm
confident we can work together,'' said Mack, who in October 1987
launched what appeared to be a long-shot campaign to fill Chiles'
seat.

   Florence Holman returned from duty in
Vietnam as an Air Force nurse 22 years ago. Only recently has she
begun to suffer crying jags and remember the death and disfigurement
she saw there.
   Holman is one of the 10,000 women called ``the invisible
veterans,'' who served unnoticed and whose long-hidden pain is
apparently just emerging.
   In the last few years, women veterans say, they have unlocked
long-lost memories of the war, found fellow female vets and consoled
one another.
   ``There are women who have never told anyone, not even their
husbands, that they were in Vietnam,'' Holman said Thursday on the
eve of Veterans Day.
   Of the 10,000 women who served in Southeast Asia during the
Vietnam War, 7,484 were in Vietnam, according to the Veterans
Administration. Most were nurses.
   They were greatly outnumbered by the 3.4 million men who served
in Southeast Asia during the war, the 350,000 women who served in
World War II and even the 34,000 women in World War I.
   But they saw some of the worst of war.
   ``They saw intense and gross casualties without relief,'' said
psychologist Jessica Wolfe of the Veterans Administration Hospital
in Boston. ``Modern technology is such that men who in past wars
would have died on the field instead made it to hospitals and died
there.''
   Wolfe treats women suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,
but said only a handful of female veterans have come to her for help.
   ``A lot of women don't want to talk about what they went
through,'' she said.
   Wolfe said Vietnam War nurses were often forced to make
life-and-death decisions because of a lack of medical help and to
assist in amputations and other difficult surgery for which they had
no training.
   Many of the veterans feel helpless, said psychologist Andrea Wild
of the Vietnam Vet Center in Springfield.
   ``They would have a patient whose face was half blown off and
about the only thing they could give him was morphine,'' she said.
   Wolfe said a study scheduled for release next month puts the rate
of post-traumatic stress disorder among women veterans at 9 percent,
compared to 15 percent for male veterans and 2 percent for the
general population.
   Women with the disorder show the same symptoms as men, such as
terrifying nightmares and numbed feelings, Wolfe said. ``Folklore
has it that even Florence Nightingale suffered PTSD,'' she said.
   The women Wolfe has treated tell of flying into Vietnam alone and
remaining isolated the entire time; of fighting constant sexual
harassment and sometimes rape; of getting the message from the
military and civilians that they weren't true combatants despite
their work and the hostility they faced on their return.
   Holman, who is a nurse in Ludlow just north of here, served in an
intensive care unit at an Air Force hospital at Cam Ranh Bay in 1966.
   She saw few casualties, but vivid memories surfaced recently of
deaf, speechless men suffering battle shock and of a roomful of
seriously injured soldiers she saw on a weeklong trip to Saigon.
   ``My initial impression was that everybody had nice clean white
dressings. The reality of missing limbs, tubes, tracheotomies didn't
hit me,'' Holman said.
   Two years ago, at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, she found
herself crying uncontrollably. She wept again last year when a
Vietnam War memorial was unveiled in New York, and discovers tears
on her face whenever she sees a television program about Vietnam.
   ``After a while you can't keep denying anymore,'' Holman said,
``especially when confronted with so many things that make you think
of Vietnam.''

<HEAD>Draft Bill On Political Parties, Resolution On Conscientious
Objectors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist government approved draft
bills to permit other political parties and adopted a resolution
allowing conscientious objectors to perform alternative military
service, a spokesman said.
   The government will present draft bills on the right of
association and assembly to parliament next month, government
spokesman Gyoergy Marosan said Thursday.
   According to the official news agency MTI, Justice Minister
Kalman Kulcsar said the right of association bill would allow
individuals and legal entities to set up ``political parties, trade
union, interest representations and other social organizations.''
   However, he said another law still being drafted would regulate
the establishment of political parties, the news agency reported.
   This law will determine the status of political parties and will
probably be included in the new constitution, the agency said. The
new constitution is not expected to be ready before 1990.
   There has been extensive debate in Hungary in recent weeks over
what some communist leaders and political analysts in Hungary see as
the inevitable development of a multi-party system.
   The media have carried comment by a wide variety of people on how
viable a multi-party system would be under certain conditions.
   Kulcsar reportedly said if the law on associations is approved by
parliament it would amount to the recognition of a multi-party
system.
   But the leading role of Hungary's only political party, the
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, will remain until the new
constitution is adopted, the news agency reported.
   East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland each have small parties
that are formally independent of the ruling communist party.
However, these small parties have virtually no voice in their
political systems.
   A second draft bill, permitting the right of assembly, would
regulate the holding of demonstrations.
   Kulcsar said any planned assembly or demonstration must be
reported to authorities three days in advance ``to maintain order.''
Police would only have the right to ban an assembly ``if there is
intention to commit a crime, or violation of the rights and freedoms
of others,'' the news agency reported.
   However, Kulcsar said in the event of a ban, an appeal could be
lodged, which would have to be handled in three days.
   The government passed a resolution allowing conscientious
objectors to work at an alternative service doing mostly manual
labor for 36 months. Mandatory military service lasts 18 months.
   Hungary would be the second Soviet bloc country to introduce an
alternative service after Poland.
   It was not clear from the agency report who would be entitled to
do an alternative service. So far only Jehovah's Witnesses and
members of the Church of Nazarene have been permitted to withdraw
from military service on grounds of religious belief.

   The 450-member Palestinian National Council, at a three-day
meeting that begins Saturday, could make its most important
decisions since the Arab League created the organization 24 years
ago.
   The move could have a profound effect on stalled Middle East
peace efforts.
   But gains in last week's Israeli elections by the right, which
opposes giving up any of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, lend
new uncertainty to the Palestinian issue.
   Senior officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization said
the council will endorse a PLO call for an independent state in the
occupied territories, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in
1967 and are home to 1.5 million Palestinians.
   They said PLO plans to establish a provisional government
probably will be delayed and the timing left to the Palestinian
National Council's 70-member Central Council, which oversees
resolutions. The National Council includes non-PLO Palestinians.
   Pragmatists in the PLO and such moderate Arab states as Egypt and
Jordan say declaring independence will be little more than symbolic
unless the National Council produces a realistic political program
that can gain international support.
   PLO leaders have considered a declaration of Palestinian
independence for years, but the idea has gained impetus during the
11-month Israeli uprising, during which at least 310 Palestinians
and 10 Israelis have been killed.
   The rebellion has won widespread sympathy and forced PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat to make hard political decisions he had postponed for
years or risk losing the leadership of increasingly frustrated
Palestinians.
   Arafat got another jolt July 31, when King Hussein of Jordan cut
legal and administrative links with the West Bank, which Jordan
governed from 1950 to 1967, and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
   Hussein's action left the PLO little choice but to assume
responsibility as the sole representative of the Palestinians, a
status endorsed by years of Arab summits.
   An important question to be answered in Algiers is how far the
National Council will go toward recognizing Israel.
   Declaration of an independent state will have its legal basis in
U.N. General Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947, which proposed
splitting Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.
   Basing the declaration on the resolution could be interpreted as
implicit recognition of Israel, but that is unlikely to satisfy
conditions Israel and the United States have set for dealing
directly with the PLO.
   Some of Arafat's key aides, and his Soviet allies, believe more
explicit recognition will overcome U.S. opposition and force Israel
to accept peace talks.
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 calls for Israel's
withdrawal from occupied land in return for recognition of its right
to exist in secure borders.
   Another reasom for U.S. and Israeli opposition to direct
negotiations is the 1968 PLO Covenant calling for armed struggle and
the destruction of the Jewish state.
   Some prominent Palestinians said the PLO could get around that
quietly, without a formal declaration, by forming a provisional
government that would write a constitution to replace the Covenant.

<HEAD>Message From Mother Of Missing Belgian Doctor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beirut newspaper today published a
message from the mother of missing Belgian physician Jan Cools
appealing to the people of Lebanon to help free her son.
   ``Please help us to get Jan released so that he can go on helping
people,'' said a letter from Mrs. Cools, published in the
conservative An-Nahar newspaper.
   The letter, written in English and translated into Arabic for
publication, was dated Oct. 21. It did not identify Mrs. Cools by
her first name.
   ``Jan has been lost for five months,'' said the letter. ``We,
Jan's family, haven't heard anything about him since the first day
of his disappearance.
   ``The only thing we can do is to guess: Is he still alive? What
about his health? Has he been hurt? We for ourselves cannot answer
these questions.''
   Cools, 32, disappeared May 21 after leaving his apartment in the
Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp near the southern port of Tyre.
He had worked in the camp for three months with the Norwegian
humanitarian organization NORWAC.
   Police said they had no information about his disappearance. But
the Fatah-Revolutionary Council group, led by terrorist Abu Nidal,
on Sunday said Cools was held by an unidentified Lebanese faction
that has not concluded its investigation of him.
   A statement in May from the so-called ``Popular Committee,''
which runs Rashidiyeh's day-to-day affairs, said Cools was kidnapped
by unidentified gunmen at a road junction near Tyre. It gave no
details.
   Recent reports in Beirut say the faction holding Cools is
demanding a $5 million ransom for his release. But neither the
police nor the Belgian Embassy would confirm that.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages
held in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The journalist, 41, is being held by a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
faction calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.
   In addition to Anderson, the 13 foreigners missing in Lebanon are
eight Americans, three Britons, an Italian and an Irishman.

   With a few disgruntled exceptions, Ellis
County residents quickly began celebrating their newfound fortune as
the beneficiaries of the Energy Department's $4.4 billon
superconducting super collider.
   Residents rushed to town squares to pop champagne corks shortly
after learning Thursday that the county just south of Dallas would
get the giant atom smasher, which drew bids from 20 states.
   ``About the only thing that might be similar to this would be
being named the city to host the next Olympics,'' saysid David
Lander, the mayor pro tem of Midlothian, population 5,000.
   Jubilant Texans cheered in celebrations at the county courthouse
and Chamber of Commerce here, the Midlothian City Hall and the Ennis
town square, as high school bands played and bank signs flashed the
good news.
   ``It's a very festive mood,'' said Lander. ``Everyone is very
excited. It's obviously going to be a tremendous boost to our north
Texas economy.''
   The collider is envisioned as a 53-mile underground ring that
will use 10,000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other at
energy levels 20 times what is possible in today's most powerful
machines. The goal: to probe more deeply into the origins of matter.
   For many north Texas residents, the project will bring new jobs,
a more technical work force, a stronger housing market, better
schools and prosperity for an area once known exclusively for its
cotton farms and ranches.
   If built, the super collider would bring an estimated 4,000
construction jobs and 3,500 permanent jobs to Waxahachie, population
18,000.
   ``The super collider is an investment in our future,'' said Phil
Bronson of Waxahachie. ``The educational level will come up once we
get all the technical people in here.''
   ``I've been through a lot of land speculation in this county, but
nothing like this,'' said real estate agency owner Tom Crabb. ``The
land values here could double inside the ring _ maybe more.''
   That prospect didn't excite everyone, however, including Dale
Wilburn, a 38-year-old machinist whose family will have to sell its
land to make way for the collider.
   ``I understand they want to break down atoms and see what's
inside them,'' he said. ``I don't really understand much more. It
would be better if they built a pipeline so we could get gas up
north to those Yankees.''
   For others, the potential changes hold more personal importance.
   Bob Hamilton, who lives in a rural development outside
Waxahachie, looks forward to getting a cafeteria. Others dream of a
new hotel, a mall, a couple of nightclubs or a rumored Disney-style
amusement park.
   Crabb, a former Waxahachie Chamber of Commerce president, said he
expects large corporations to set their sights on Waxahachie. Arby's
already has staked out a parcel of land, he said.
   It's estimated the project will pump $270 million into the local
economy, but the windfall would spread far beyond the county line.
   ``This will change our economic and educational base for all
time,'' says Dallas City Councilman Jack Evans, who led a committee
to lure the project to Texas. ``You will see many awards and
benefits coming out of the research that will be done here.''
   The Energy Department's decision got some negative reviews,
especially from the six other finalist states that didn't get the
plum. Politicians from some of the losers _ Illinois, Colorado,
Michigan, Arizona, Tennessee and North Carolina _ called for a
bipartisan review of the selection process.
   Some locals also expressed reservations about the project.
   ``Personally, I hate to see this come, but it can't be helped,''
said county sheriff's Lt. Joe Bob Underwood. ``My brother and I own
a ranch, and this always has been a lot of farm land. But that's
going to change now.''
   Dick Erwin, who bought a house south of Red Oak four years ago,
said he had mixed emotions. ``I'm glad the county's going to get
it,'' Erwin said, ``but I'm sorry I'm going to have to lose my
house.''

   Swastikas and other anti-Semitic slurs were painted at a Jewish
cemetery in Rhode Island, a Denver synagogue and a Jewish student
building in New York as thousands marked the 50th anniversary of
Nazi rioting that heralded the Holocaust.
   Officials said Thursday the spray painting at the 95-year-old
cemetery in Woonsocket, R.I., took place about Tuesday, the day
before synagogues, churches and schools worldwide remembered
Kristallnacht, or ``The Night of Broken Glass.''
   On Nov. 9, 1938, Nazi thugs went on a rampage, killing scores of
Jews and setting ablaze more than 1,100 synagogues in Germany and
Austria.
   A woman visiting B'nai Israel Cemetery on Tuesday found her son's
headstone among the approximately half-dozen covered with Nazi
crosses, swastikas and other symbols. The main road to the cemetery
was inscribed with slogans such as ``Die Jews'' and the German word
for Jew, ``Juden.''
   ``Today, when I went to the cemetery, it was a very terrible
reminder of things that have happened to us in the past,'' Temple
B'nai Israel President Edith Wittes told a congregation assembled
for a Kristallnacht memorial service Wednesday.
   Police were uncertain whether the desecration was linked to
Kristallnacht, but the timing raised questions, said Detective Sgt.
Ronald Bashand.
   In addition to the Nazi symbols, there were other images with
possible links to Satan worship, such as skulls and an inverted
cross with its arms turned down.
   ``The form of the desecration was clear _ the symbols are here _
everything that made Kristallnacht possible,'' said Rabbi Joel
Chernikoff. ``The sickness that made Adolf Hitler possible is alive
and well today, in our own community.''
   Among the other phrases spray-painted on the road were ``Death''
and ``Napalm.''
   In Denver, swastikas were spray-painted on a synagogue and a
Jewish-owned delicatessan Wednesday night, said Saul Rosenthal,
director of the Mountain States office of the Anti-Defamation League.
   ``They are an unfortunate occurrence on this date,'' he said. ``I
really doubt that it's coincidental.''
   Swastikas were spray-painted on the front door and sign in front
of the synagogue at the Hebrew Educational Alliance, Rosenthal said.
At Steinberg's Deli, swastikas and the slogan ``Jude die'' were
painted.
   ``We see this stuff all too regularly,'' Rosenthal said, but it
was ``very, very emotional to have it take place on this particular
day.''
   At the State University of New York at Binghamton, N.Y.,
swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans were found Thursday morning
spray-painted inside the office of the Jewish Student Union.
   ``I can't even find the word for it, it's so hurtful,'' said
James Oppenheim, president of the student group.
   There was no sign of forced entry at the office and sanctuary,
housed in the basement of the college's student union, Oppenheim
said. The group has about 200 students that coordinate activities on
the campus.
   ``I think it's politically motivated because they didn't do any
damage that we can see,'' Oppenheim said.
   The group had sponsored a candlelight vigil Wednesday night to
commemorate Kristallnacht.

<HEAD>Kate Nelligan Stars in Michael Weller's `Spoils of War' on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS reactions of other critics at end. No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Playwright Michael Weller set ``Moonchildren,''
his first theatrical success, in the turbulent 1960s. It was
followed some five years later by ``Loose Ends,'' which examined
several lives in the more self-satisfied, if not any more satisfying
1970s.
   Now Weller delves further into the past with ``Spoils of War,'' a
highly personal, not entirely convincing, family drama of the
mid-1950s, with emphasis on the word ``family.'' The play opened
Thursday at Broadway's Music Box Theater.
   A perfect family is what 16-year-old Martin wants more than
anything else. A student at ``one of the best progressive schools in
the East,'' he returns to New York in an effort to reunite his
divorced parents _ Andrew, a cold, reserved photographer, and Elise,
a beautiful, hard-drinking, hard-living romantic.
   Andrew and Elise are left-over leftists, trying to shake off the
effects of the Depression, World War II and Sen. Joseph McCarthy on
their lives. They never quite succeed. Their love lives are equally
messy. Neither has ever had a satisfactory relationship, as the
drama takes pains to point out. Martin has been the only lasting
reminder of their marriage.
   Weller has called the play ``semi-autobiographical,'' but the
center of ``Spoils of War'' is not the teen-age Martin or his father
but the flamboyant Elise. She's the most compelling character Weller
has ever written, and in Kate Nelligan's Tony-caliber performance,
the woman comes vividly to life.
   Miss Nelligan, wearing a striking red wig, invests a lot in the
character, and her hard work pays off. Elise is funny in a
self-mocking way, sexy, vulnerable and most important, intelligent,
even recognizing her own flaws.
   The character is not above borrowing money from her best friend,
a still-committed revolutionary named Emma, played with endearing
sweetness by a terrific character actress named Alice Playten. Elise
also is willing to flirt _ and more _ with Lew, a Midwest building
contractor, if he builds for her a house where she can finally make
a home. He's played with hayseed authenticity by Kevin O'Rourke.
   Almost as interesting as Elise is Martin, the son who is not
above manipulation if it will help bring his parents together.
Christopher Collet mixes the right amount of boyish charm and
deviousness to bring it off.
   ``Spoils of War'' tells Martin's story, a shattering of his dream
about the perfect mother and father.
   It's Andrew, the father, who remains the problem in the play.
When the drama was performed last spring at off-Broadway's tiny
Second Stage, the man was something of a cipher. Weller has made the
role larger but not altogether clearer.
   Andrew, played with an icy intensity by Jeffrey De Munn, tries to
justify his desertion of wife and child as well as his political
causes. His answer _ which won't be revealed here _ drew
unintentional laughter from the audience at the show's last preview.
   It doesn't help that Andrew also comes equipped with a young
girlfriend, Penny, blandly played by Marita Geraghty. The actress is
not as effective as Annette Bening who had the role at Second Stage.
As a result, it's simply no contest between the wimpy girlfriend and
the dominating but desirable ex-wife when they finally have a
showdown.
   Director Austin Pendleton has given the play an austere and
unsentimental production. Despite the overflowing of argument,
Pendleton doesn't allow the drama to turn to mush.
   But he does allow a massive, turntable set of drab living rooms
designed by Andrew Jackness to nearly overwhelm what should be an
intimate drama. The rooms swivel ominously between every scene.
   In the end then, ``Spoils of War'' is not a perfect play, just a
small one. But it certainly is intriguing, chiefly because of the
incandescent Miss Nelligan.

<TEXT>
   Here are the findings of some other New York critics.
   In The New York Times, Frank Rich wrote that Weller ``seemed on
the verge of a major breakthrough with this work,'' but it didn't
quite deliver.
   He said it is Wellers' ``most absorbing play, always intelligent
and at times moving, but it is still too lumpy, both in the writing
and in Austin Pendleton's erratic direction, to achieve the lofty
theatrical stature promised by its characters and ideas.''
   But the Times called the plan ``compulsively watchable whenever
Ms. Nelligan is on stage.''
   In the Daily News, Howard Kissel wrote that the story is ``less
convincing because its principal combatants are all essentially
selfish, cold people.''
   ``It is hard to know why the son wants to bring his parents
together, since his father left before he was old enough to remember
them as a couple.''
   In the New York Post, Clive Barnes called the play ``emotionally
charged and moving.''
   He said he suspects the play ``is still not the one Weller would
have liked to have written.''
   But while he concluded ``it is not `The Glass Menagerie' or even
an animal in such a zoo _ it remains a touchingly lovely work
touchingly performed.''

<HEAD>Bakkers, Aide, Must Repay $7.7 Million To PTL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing the biblical wisdom that people reap
what they sow, a judge ordered Jim and Tammy Bakker and a former top
aide to repay $7.7 million to PTL for taking undeserved profits from
the TV ministry.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds said he determined that the
Bakkers and former PTL vice president David Taggart were overpaid
during their last four years at the ministry.
   ``In conforming with the religious overture of this case, this
court observes that James Bakker either overlooked or ignored parts
of the Bible, including 1 Timothy 6:10 ... `For the love of money is
the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have
erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many
sorrows,''' Reynolds said in his order, filed Thursday.
   Reynolds said Galatians 6:7 should also be applied to the PTL
case: ```Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man
soweth, that shall he also reap.'''
   PTL, now under administration of the bankruptcy court, sued the
Bakkers and Taggart on Feb. 1 for $52 million. The ministry alleged
they grossly mismanaged the ministry by taking huge sums for
personal use between 1984 and 1987 while PTL couldn't pay its bills.
   During the trial, which ended Oct. 20, PTL dropped its claim to
all but $7.7 million. Reynolds's judgment is the first time any
court has ruled that Bakker or other PTL leaders used PTL donors'
money improperly.
   In the order, Reynolds said Jim Bakker, who founded PTL and left
in March 1987 after admitting to a tryst with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn, must pay PTL $4.9 million. Tammy Bakker, his
wife and former co-host of the ``PTL Club'' television show, must
repay $677,397, and Taggart must repay $1 million.
   In addition, Reynolds ordered, Bakker and Taggart jointly must
repay PTL another $1 million. Taggart was fired in April 1987 by
Jerry Falwell, who took over PTL from Bakker.
   PTL attorney R. Bradford Leggett of Winston-Salem, N.C., said,
``I think the judge's opinion made a clear suggestion that when
people contribute to support a ministry, there is a trust involved
that must be dealt with in good faith.''
   Reynolds, in his 50-page order, said PTL's expenditures under
Bakker were ``unbelievable'' and a ``waste of PTL's money.'' He also
accused the administrators of ``gross mismanagement'' and ``total
disregard for reality.''
   Reynolds said it appeared the PTL board of directors was never
informed that the ministry and Christian theme park near Fort Mill
was in ``any kind of precarious financial position.''
   The judge rejected Bakker's attempts during the trial to justify
the $6.6 million in salary and bonuses he and his wife collected
between 1984 and 1987.
   ``We plan to appeal,'' said Ryan Hovis, the Bakkers' Rock Hill
attorney. Hovis said Bakker could not repay the ministry because
``he doesn't have anything.''
   A secretary at the Bakkers' new organization, Jim and Tammy
Ministries in Pineville, N.C., said Bakker would not comment until
he reads the order.
   Taggart's attorney, Ben Cotten of Washington, D.C., did not
return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Last month, Bakker and several former PTL associates were
notified they are targets of an investigation by a federal grand
jury in Charlotte, N.C., which focuses on possible mail and wire
fraud, conspiracy and criminal tax violations.
   Leggett said that although the Bakkers and Taggart have the right
to appeal Reynolds' judgment to U.S. District Court, PTL intends to
begin trying to collect from them.
   Reynolds is scheduled to choose a buyer for PTL's assets on
Wednesday from four bids ranging from $113 million to $120 million.

<HEAD>Researcher Sentenced In Academic Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationally recognized drug therapy researcher
was sentenced to 60 days in a halfway house for submitting false
data to the National Institute of Mental Health on treatment of
mentally retarded children.
   The researcher, Stephen E. Breuning, is believed to be the first
scientist prosecuted by the federal government for faking medical
research.
   U.S. District Judge Frank A. Kaufman on Thursday also sentenced
Breuning, 36, to five years of probation, and ordered him to pay
back $11,352 in salary, serve 250 hours of community service and
abstain from psychological research for at least the period of his
probation. Breuning agreed to stay out of the field at least 10
years, as requested by prosecutors.
   ``It's quite obvious that our society cannot tolerate this type
of fraud,'' the judge told Breuning, a former University of
Pittsburgh psychologist. ``Fraud eats at the very guts of society.''
   Kaufman ordered Breuning to serve his sentence in a halfway house
near his home in Rochester, Mich., where he recently opened a store
selling compact discs and stereo equipment.
   Breuning pleaded guilty Sept. 19 to two counts of making false
statements on grant applications in exchange for the dropping of a
charge that he obstructed an investigation at Bethesda-based NIMH
into the authenticity of his data.
   ``You've paid very, very dearly for what you've done. You will
continue to pay dearly,'' the judge said.
   Prosecutors said that not only was Breuning's career ruined, but
he had hurt research assistants ``who had rested their careers on
his work.''
   The judge called Breuning's actions ``the kind of aberration of
conduct that could (occur among other researchers) in the highly
charged competitive atmosphere'' of academia.
   A remorseful Breuning told the judge that his guilt was
``something I'm very embarrassed and ashamed about.''
   The case sparked a tightening of standards for monitoring
academic research as well as calls for legislation targeting
scientists who fake their data.
   According to prosecutors and a statement of facts in the case,
Breuning's research involved several NIMH-sponsored studies from
1980 to 1984 at the University of Pittsburgh to examine the use of
drugs in controlling hyperactive retarded children.
   The studies purportedly showed that children could be treated
with smaller doses of tranquilizers as well as with stimulants such
as Ritalin and Dexedrine, which had fewer side effects than
tranquilizers.
   In a sentencing memorandum, E. Thomas Roberts, an assistant U.S.
attorney, said Breuning seized on the opportunity to prove the
popular theory that ``less immediate intervention with drugs,''
coupled with other treatment techniques, could be more beneficial to
the children.
   But in his eagerness, Breuning used false data and research
results from other studies, said Roberts and Breuning's attorney,
Charles S. Lazar.
   There was ``no evidence supporting most of the research by Dr.
Breuning,'' the sentencing memorandum said, and much of the research
by his assistants ``was producing contradictory information to that
which Dr. Breuning was officially reporting.''
   Prosecutors said only 25 of 278 children in the studies actually
received the drugs.
   The grants Breuning obtained provided ``significant'' financial
support for the university's psychiatric clinic, Roberts said in
court papers.
   Lazar said in documents that his client, who sought $200,000 in
grants from NIMH, falsified the data because he felt pressured by
the publish-or-perish atmosphere of academic research. He said
Breuning intended to combine previous research with work done at the
University of Pittsburgh, but instead produced a study that was
``careless and misleading.''
   However, prosecutors and Lazar noted, Breuning received no
personal financial benefit from the grants, no children were harmed
by treatment based on his research and the University of Pittsburgh
repayed $162,000 in grants to NIMH.

<HEAD>Cold Front Whips Through Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   One cold front swept off the East Coast early today while another
raced through the Rockies, bringing snow to the Colorado mountains
and western Wyoming as it spread into the northern Plains.
   Four to 8 inches of snow was expected in some areas.
   Early this morning, rain fell on northern Maine, coastal sections
of Massachusetts and North Carolina. Patchy showers were reported
along the Gulf Coast.
   Some rain and snow also extended from the northern Rockies to
eastern Washington. A few showers were reported in the southwestern
states.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the central Rockies into

<HEAD>Death Toll From Three Typhoons Hits 670, 600 More Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Floods and mudslides swamped several
towns on the island of Palawan, killing 75 people and raising to at
least 670 the number feared dead from three typhoons that struck the
country in two weeks, officials said today.
   The Philippine Red Cross said about 600 people were missing on
Palawan alone, after widespread flooding and landslides caused by
heavy rain generated by Tess, the second of three storms to hit the
country between Oct. 24 and Nov. 7.
   Tito Larrosa, coordinator of the government's Office of Civil
Defense on Palawan, said in many instances the landslides and floods
hit simultaneously last Friday and Saturday.
   ``In Rizal, when the water came from the mountains, it was
followed by the mud,'' Larrosa said in a telephone interview from
the Palawan provincial capital of Puerto Princesa, 370 miles
southwest of Manila.
   He said in many places along the island's north-south coastal
road, ``the water rose up to seven feet.''
   ``We heard about the floods on Nov. 6, but it was not only until
yesterday that the reports of the deaths started coming,'' he said.
``We have not heard from the Calamian group,'' a cluster of islands
north of Palawan that is part of the province.
   Palawan, 270 miles long, is known as the Philippines' ``last
frontier'' because of its ruggedness and, with the exception of the
provincial capital, its isolation from the rest of the country.
   He said among the hardest hit towns was Rizal, where 23 people
were confirmed killed by the floods and landslides.
   Until the reports from Palawan came in, officials had reported
only 11 deaths from tropical storm Tess, which hit the country last
weekend.
   Officials said 181 people were killed on land when Typhoon Ruby
struck Oct. 24. At least 64 more people drowned when the ferry Dona
Marilyn sank at the height of its fury. Another 200 passengers are
missing and presumed dead.
   The death toll from Typhoon Skip, which hit the central
Philippines Nov. 7, stood at 139 today. But officials said they
expected it to rise further as more reports from remote areas came
in.

   Debra Winger and Nick Nolte will star in
a mystery movie written by playwright Arthur Miller, the movie's
producers announced.
   The film, ``Everybody Wins,'' will be shot in eight weeks in and
around Wilmington and at N.C. Film Studios, production manager Tim
Bourne said Thursday. He described the story as ``a murder mystery
set in a small New England mill town.''
   Miller, author of ``Death of a Salesman,'' wrote an original
screenplay for the film, Bourne said.
   The independent production will be by Jeremy Thomas, the British
producer of ``The Last Emperor,'' which won nine 1988 Academy
Awards, including best picture, Bourne said.
   It will be directed by Karel Reisz, a British director whose
credits include ``Sweet Dreams,'' ``The French Lieutenant's Woman''
and ``Who'll Stop the Rain?''
   Ms. Winger starred in ``Betrayed'' and ``An Officer and a
Gentleman.'' Nolte, whose credits include ``Down and Out in Beverly
Hills,'' filmed ``Weeds'' in Wilmington in 1986.

<HEAD>Forest Service Outgunned By ``Rambo'' Deer Hunters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL L. GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW WAVERLY, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swelling troops of deer hunters in east
Texas, including ``Rambo'' types in military dress armed with
semi-automatic weapons, are outmanning and outgunning U.S. Forest
Service agents on public lands, officials say.
   ``It's scary as hell,'' Billy Ball, special agent for the Forest
Service, said Thursday. ``These guys are carrying cannons and we're
regulated by policy with six-shooting pop pistols.''
   Last year, Texas moved past Pennsylvania to become the state
issuing the most hunting licenses. But as the ranks of hunters have
grown and become unruly, a situation aggravated by alcohol and drug
use, some private land owners have been restricting access to their
property, officials say.
   All of which has put increased pressure on east Texas' four
national forests _ Sabine, Davy Crockett, Angelina and Sam Houston _
during the firearms deer season that began last weekend.
   ``I wouldn't go out there myself nor take my family,'' said Carl
Gidlund, a U.S. Forest Service public information officer. ``It's
turning into an arsenal out there.''
   ``What's changed on the forest is that we're seeing a lot of
military weapons,'' or semi-automatic weapons, instead of rifles,
Ball said.
   ``We seeing people moving away from the traditional weapons to a
military look, dress, weapons. We call it `the Rambo syndrome.' They
get their faces painted up and they're wild-looking.''
   In the deer season's first weekend, law enforcement officers
received death threats from hunters, a 14-year-old boy was wounded
by a hunter firing at a wounded deer, and another hunter was found
unconscious after falling 30 feet from an illegal deer blind, or a
platform devised to hide hunters from deer.
   Officers also were investigating illegal blockades set up by some
hunters to keep others off public land and incidents in which nails
were spread over some federal forest roads.
   ``We presume it's people trying to keep other people out of their
`exclusive' hunting areas,'' Gidlund said. ``One witness said he
picked up 20 pounds of nails.''
   On Wednesday night, three hunters told authorities they were
ordered at gunpoint from national forest land by other hunters.
   ``It's locals who say `My daddy and my granddaddy hunted here and
you city slickers aren't hunting here,''' Ball said. ``And we have
to referee these things.
   ``I'm not classifying all hunters like this. But you got a crowd
of people getting together with adrenalin pumping and some alcohol
and drug use. And you're going to have trouble.''
   Ball is one of seven federal law enforcement officers patrolling
700,000 acres in 15 counties. The agents are equipped with six-shot,
.357-caliber Magnum pistols.
   Officials say the Sam Houston National Forest, about 50 miles
north of Houston, has the most hunting pressure, followed by the
Davy Crockett, about another 50 miles farther north.
   Rich Glodowski, district law officer for the Sam Houston forest,
said he wears a bullet-proof vest to protect himself while on patrol.
   ``But with the firepower out there, there's no way it's going to
stop it,'' he said. ``I'm not sure what the answer is.''
   In addition to semi-automatics, officials are finding greater use
of handguns.
   ``They've got two or more handguns and bandoleers (ammunition
belts) with 90 rounds. You can kill all the damn deer in East Texas
with those,'' Ball said.
   Although no statistics were available on the number of hunters in
the forests, all of the Forest Service campgrounds for hunters are
filled, Gidlund said.
   Jerry McCrae, of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department regional
office in Rusk, said some private land owners are charging hunters
$400 per gun to hunt, and many won't tolerate ``Rambo'' types on
their land.
   ``The national forest is a natural attraction for those
individuals,'' McCrae said. ``It is open and the fact it is free, it
does attract a crowd.''

<TEXT>
   Two flash fires and a powerful explosion
ripped through a printing plant, knocking firefighters ``right out
of the building and onto the pavement'' and injuring at least 20
people, officials said.
   The plant and the adjacent building housing The Courier-Journal,
Kentucky's largest newspaper, were evacuated from the scene Thursday
night, and a large downtown block was sealed off by police.
   The fires and explosion at Standard Gravure Corp. were fueled by
ink and naphtha, a volatile chemical used to thin printing ink that
was believed responsible for the explosion, officials said. Two
pressman and 18 firefighters were hurt, said fire Capt. Keith
Milliner.
   The Courier-Journal, meanwhile, relied on an emergency agreement
with the competing Lexington Herald-Leader, 80 miles away, to print
today's paper.
   The newspaper's staff went ``back to the old-fashioned way,''
said George Gill, president and publisher. Staffers worked with
typewriters and telephones set up in an old company-owned building
across the street.
   An eight-page edition, without ads, was planned.
   ``It won't be much of a newspaper, but it will be a newspaper,''
Gill said, noting that The Courier-Journal had never missed a day of
publication.
   Art Smithers, night supervisor at the plant, which prints
magazines and color advertising materials, said the first fire broke
out about 6 p.m. in one of the presses, injuring two pressmen. The
blaze apparently was started by static electricity, said Capt.
Dennis Kangas of the city's arson squad.
   A chemical fire extinguisher that came on automatically put out
the blaze, said pressman Walter Emert.
   But the fire tore open the press's ink fountain, which holds 30
to 40 gallons, said Standard Gravure vice president Jack Uhl.
   Workers were cleaning up from the first fire when the second
flared, apparently ignited by embers contacting newsprint and ink
that had spilled on the floor, Smithers said. The fire spread to a
sub-basement lacking an automatic fire extinguisher.
   Firefighters who entered the building with chemicals and hoses to
put out the ink-related fire were unaware that the highly volatile
chemical vapors from the ink were filling the building and fueling
the flames, said Milliner.
   He said the force of the blast about 7:25 p.m. lifted
firefighters off their feet, knocking some into walls and through
doors into a parking lot.
   The explosion left a gaping, two-story hole in the rear wall of
the six-story building.
   Sgt. John Hall said he was helping lay a line when about 10
firefighters were ``blown right out of the building and onto the
pavement here.''
   Injured firefighters staggered from the building, coughing and
gasping, and some appeared dazed. About 65 firefighters had been
called to battle the blazes.
   At least eight of the injured firefighters were admitted to
Humana Hospital-University of Louisville with first- and
second-degree burns, head injuries and lung irritations, said Dr.
Frank Lavoie, an emergency room physician.
   Seven others were treated and released at the hospital for first-
and second-degree flash burns on their faces and hands, and smoke
inhalation, said spokeswoman Taylor Rice.
   The two injured pressmen were taken to Methodist Evangelical
Hospital for treatment of burns on their arms and faces. A hospital
spokeswoman said they were in stable condition.
   Standard Gravure President Michael Shea said he expected that one
or more of the $10 million presses would have to be substantially
rebuilt.

   When Olive May Wilburn, 81, learned that
the superconducting super collider was coming, she wept for the home
her family stands to lose, along with the land her late husband
began farming in 1944.
   The Energy Department announced Thursday that it would locate the
$4.4 billion atom smasher, which 20 states had bid for, in Ellis
County, just south of Dallas.
   The project promises to bring a bonanza of jobs, better schools
and other benefits to the area. For Mrs. Wilburn, it promises to
take away the 200-acre farm her husband worked until his death 10
years ago and where her 3-year-old great-granddaughter, Pamela
Hopgood, now plays.
   Plans call for the Wilburn homestead to become the research
campus for the super collider, about midway between Waxahachie and
Maypearl. The farm is about five miles northeast of Maypearl.
   Only Wednesday, the wheat field around Mrs. Wilburn's house was
plowed. Now she doesn't know what to do.
   ``I just kept thinking that maybe it wouldn't come, maybe it
wouldn't happen,'' she said.
   After Texas bid for the super collider, state and federal
officials notified the Wilburns their acreage would be needed if the
state won.
   Mrs. Wilburn's granddaughter, Betty Hopgood, heard the news on
the radio Thursday morning, and told her grandmother.
   The announcement had many in Ellis County jumping for joy, but it
brought grief and anger to the Wilburn family.
   Mrs. Wilburn collapsed on her bed in tears.
   ``I cried, but not too long,'' said Mrs. Wilburn, who with her
husband worked 20 years to pay off the mortgage. ``It don't do no
good anymore. I've got to get out and I don't know where I'm going.''
   ``I hate to see farmers who have worked all their lives for their
land have everything taken away,'' said Mrs. Hopgood.
   ``I understand they want to break down atoms and see what's
inside them,'' said Mrs. Wilburn's grandson, Dale Wilburn, a
38-year-old machinist who lives with her. ``I don't really
understand much more. It would be better if they built a pipeline so
we could get gas up north to those Yankees.''
   Wilburn said he checked local land values and has found some
property selling for up to $6,000 an acre.
   ``I don't know if that would be enough to buy something
comparable,'' he said. ``We'll be out on the street and I don't know
if that will be enough.''
   Mrs. Hopgood, watching Pamela run across her great-grandmother's
kitchen, doubted they will be able to buy enough adjacent land for
the family to live as close to each other as they have.
   ``We'll never be together again, pretty soon,'' Mrs. Hopgood
said. ``We'll be lucky to find land fairly close to each other.''
   Wilburn, looking over a fence line dotted with rusting harvesting
equipment and rusting automobiles, said he is holding out hope the
project will stall.
   ``The government's always talking about something and never doing
it,'' he said. ``Maybe this will never get off the ground. Maybe
they're just talking again.''

<TEXT>
   Three Politburo members flew to the three Baltic
republics today to deal with growing complaints that proposed Soviet
constitutional reforms will crush current moves toward economic and
cultural independence from Moscow.
   Politburo member Viktor Chebrikov traveled to Estonia, Vadim
Medvedev to Latvia and Nikolai Slyunkov to Lithuania. Their visits
were reported by state-owned media in the Baltics but not by the
national media in Moscow.
   The visits come a day after the Politburo, the top Communist
Party leadership, decided to consider changing draft constitutional
amendments in response to thousands of suggestions, the official
newspaper Pravda reported today for the first time.
   Popular front movements, local governments and Communist Party
organizations in the three republics have denounced reform measures.
At issue are provisions that would eliminate the right of republics
to secede from the Soviet Union and shift power from the 14
non-Russian republics to Moscow.
   The popular front in Vilnius, the Lithuanian Restructuring
Movement meets Sunday to consider the issue and the Lithuanian
Supreme Soviet will meet Thursday. The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or
legislature, is to meet Wednesday.
   Members of the three popular fronts are gathering signatures on
petitions asking the amendments be dropped and re-written from
scratch, said Algimontas Vaishnoras of the Lithuanian Restructuring
Movement.
   The Pravda article also promised future discussion of ``questions
of the status of unions and autonomous republics, to expand the
rights and possibilities in various spheres of economic,
social-political and cultural life.''
   It said the 300-member Central Committee of the Communist Party
plans a special meeting on the subject, but the newspaper gave no
date.
   The Presidium, elected by the Supreme Soviet or parliament, has
received more than 80,000 letters on the proposed amendments, Pravda
reported.
   Most are favorable, it said, but many suggest changes being
reviewed by a special commission of the Supreme Soviet.
   ``No argument will go without attention,'' it promised. However,
it said the leadership planned to tackle many of the issues in later
constitutional reform.
   The Baltic republics are not the only ones with serious
complaints. Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov has publicly
argued that the reform concentrates too much power in a strong
presidency, risking a repeat of the disastrous rule of dictator
Josef Stalin.
   Sakharov also seeks a strong guarantee of free speech in the
constitutinoal reform.

   In a stinging ruling, the state Supreme
Court said parents have no right to ``make martyrs of their
children'' by placing their physical health entirely in the hands of
faith healers.
   The court Thursday allowed the involuntary manslaughter
prosecution of Laurie Walker of Sacramento, a Christian Scientist
whose 4-year-old daughter died of meningitis in March 1984, 17 days
after being taken to a faith healer.
   The court rejected arguments that a parent cannot be prosecuted
for choosing prayer rather than conventional medical treatment for a
child when the choice is made in accordance with church beliefs.
   Mrs. Walker's lawyer, Thomas Volk, said he would appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court if the state court refuses to reconsider its
decision.
   ``Spiritual healing is an indispensible part of Christian Science
religion,'' Volk said. Allowing the prosecution of a sincerely
believing church member for resorting to spiritual healing
``threatens the very heart of Christian Science,'' he said.
   Volk had argued that parents would be protected from prosecution
by state law and constitutional freedom of religion.
   Deputy Attorney General Clifford Thompson declined to comment on
the case.
   The church, which claims at least 350,000 members worldwide,
doesn't forbid its members to go to doctors but they are supposed to
refrain from conventional medical treatment at the same time they
are seeking spiritual healing, Volk said.
   Thursday's decision affects pending prosecutions in Sonoma and
Los Angeles counties against Christian Science parents whose
children also died of meningitis while under spiritual care.
   In each case, the charges were based on allegations that the
failure to seek conventional treatment amounted to criminal
negligence, causing the children's death.
   Mrs. Walker called a Christian Science practitioner after her
daughter, Shauntay, showed flu symptoms in February 1984. The
practitioner and a Christian Science nurse attended and prayed for
the girl, but she died 17 days later. She received no conventional
medical treatment.
   In Thursday's opinion, Justice Stanley Mosk quoted a 1944 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that denied a religious exemption from child
labor laws.
   ``Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves,'' that ruling
said. ``But it does not follow they are free, in identical
circumstances, to make martyrs of their children.''
   Upholding lower court decisions, the California court said
Christian Science church-sponsored state laws passed in 1925 and
1976 recognized the right to seek spiritual healing in some
circumstances, but did not provide a shield against criminal charges
when a child is threatened with serious harm.
   Volk, Mrs. Walker's lawyer, contended the state could enforce
laws that allow courts and social workers to intervene on behalf of
endangered children and not prosecute. But Mosk said those
procedures would work only if the government learned of a child's
interest in time to take action.

   Emperor Hirohito spent much of today sleeping, but
palace officials said he managed to watch some television and visit
with a daughter despite his weakened condition.
   They said the 87-year-old monarch, bedridden since Sept. 19, had
a fever of 100.2 F but otherwise was stable.
   His blood pressure, which plunged to 68 over 30 earlier this
week, had recovered to 144 over 70, the palace reported.
   This afternoon, the emperor was awake to see his fourth daughter,
Atsuko, and her husband, Takamasa Ikeda. He appeared weary and only
whispered ``thank you,'' Mrs. Ikeda told Kyodo News Service.
   Hirohito was sleeping when relatives visited him earlier, but did
awaken at midday and watched television, said Shoichi Fujimori,
grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency.
   ``He needs to sleep because his fever has lasted a long time and
made him tired,'' a senior palace official said.
   Hirohito has not discharged blood or received any transfusions
the past two days. But court doctors remain on alert because
internal hemorrhaging could occur any time, palace spokesman Kenji
Maeda said.
   Meanwhile, opposition parties accused the governing Liberal
Democratic Party of using the emperor's illness for politics.
   The Liberals, who hold a commanding majority in the Parliament,
forced controversial tax reform bills through a Parliament committee
Thursday.
   They told opposition parties, which boycotted the committee, that
they had to proceed with passing the bills because the emperor was
ill.
   ``We believe it is against the constitution to use the emperor's
name for their political gain,'' said Tomio Sakagami, a legislator
from the main opposition Japan Socialist Party.
   Opposition members denied they were abusing the emperor's name.

   Fewer U.S. military recruits are infected with
AIDS compared to three years ago, a decline federal health officials
believe is due to men who fear they may be infected not signing up
for duty.
   During the first six months of the military's AIDS testing
program, which was launched in October 1985, 15 out of every 10,000
recruits tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus. But between
October 1987 and March 1988, 12 in every 10,000 recruits were found
to be infected, the national Centers for Disease Control reported
Thursday.
   ``Our leading hypothesis is that it reflects self-deferral among
high-risk applicants _ people who know they have (AIDS virus)
infections, or suspect they might be at increased risk, are not
coming into the recruitment centers,'' said Dr. Marta Gwinn, an AIDS
specialist with the Atlanta-based CDC.
   That theory is based in part on the fact that while there has
been a ``statistically significant decrease'' in AIDS infection
among male recruits, infection rates among female recruits _ who may
be less likely to think they are infected _ have stayed largely
constant, the CDC said in its weekly report.
   The rate of AIDS infection among male recruits has dropped from
17 per 10,000 in initial testing to 12 in the latest numbers, while
the rate for female recruits has risen from seven per 10,000 to
eight.
   ``Women may be less aware of their risk for ... infection,'' the
CDC said. Only 9 percent of all U.S. AIDS cases have occurred in
women; homosexual or bisexual men account for 68 percent.
   Although AIDS infection rates are lower among military recruits
than the public _ largely because gay men and drug users are subject
to exclusion from military service _ the military test results are
still of interest to researchers, Ms. Gwinn said.
   ``If the incidence of infection were to decline, we might detect
it first in the youngest age groups,'' she said, noting that
military recruits tend to be in their late teens or early 20s.
   ``Were we to see a dramatic decline in the youngest age group, it
would be potentially encouraging,'' she added. ``That is not what is
happening at the present time, though.''
   The military has tested more than 1.5 million recruits for AIDS
infection. More than 2,100, or 0.14 percent, have tested positive.
Federal health officials estimate that about 0.6 percent of the U.S.
population is infected with the AIDS virus.

resignation announcement as provided by Jenninger's office. The text
was translated by The Associated Press.
   ``The reactions to my speech yesterday to the German parliament
have deeply shocked me and have greatly depressed me.
   ``My speech was not understood by many listeners the way I had
intended it to be. I am deeply sorry and I am very hurt, if I have
offended the feelings of others.
   ``During my whole political career _ most recently as president
of the German parliament _ I have been active in working for
reconciliation with the Jews and for the vital interests of the

   ``I always have been an uncompromising foe of every type of
totalitarian rule, not least because of the experiences of my
parents under the Nazi regime, who were opposed to the dictatorship
and as a result had to accept disadvantages.''
   ``It is important that the office of the Bundestag president not
be damaged. I must assume that many of my colleagues no longer have
the necessary confidence in my leadership. For this reason I
announce my resignation from the office of Bundestag president.''

<TEXT>
   President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the
Maldives was inaugurated today for a third five-year term after
weathering a coup attempt on the Indian Ocean island chain last
week, the government said.
   ``In view of what happened last week, the ceremony was simple.
There was no fireworks, no celebrations,'' said Ahmed Saleem, a
Foreign Ministry undersecretary contacted by telephone from New
Delhi.
   Saleem said 1,200 guests, including delegates from the United
States and India, attended the ceremony in Male, the Maldivian
capital.
   On Nov. 3, an estimated 150 Sri Lankan mercenaries officials
tried to overthrow the government but fled the next day when
hundreds of Indian paratroopers arrived at Gayoom's request.
   At least a dozen people died in fighting between Gayoom's lightly
armed militia and the mercenaries, who officials say were hired by a
former Maldivian leader who lost to Gayoom in a previous election.
   Six other people were killed aboard a cargo ship on which some
mercenaries tried to flee, only to be intercepted by the Indian navy.
   During the inauguration, Saleem said, ``We observed a one-minute
silence in memory of those who died while defending their
motherland.''
   The ceremony took place as scheduled in an open-air stadium,
despite earlier reports it would be moved to the presidential palace
for security.
   The 50-year-old president won a third five-year term Sept. 23 in
a yes-or-no referendum. About 90 percent of votes cast supported him.
   The Maldives is a chain of 2,000 tiny coral islands in the Indian
Ocean. Male is about 370 miles south of India's southern tip.

   Radical students set fire today to the
provincial home of former President Chun Doo-hwan to press demands
for his arrest on corruption charges.
   Five riot police were injured in the firebomb attack on Chun's
former home in Hyupchon, 175 miles southeast of Seoul. Six students,
some of whom carried steel pipes, were arrested.
   The attack touched off a fire that burned three thatched-roof
structures at the house. The house was inhabited and being guarded
by a platoon-size riot police unit at the time the attack occurred.
   Several fire trucks and 100 village people were mobilized to help
put out the blaze, which took nearly 1{ hours to bring under control.
   The attack was the latest in a series of protests by radical
students to press demands that Chun be arrested and punished on
corruption charges. Major street protests last week attracted tens
of thousands of people.
   Chun, who left office in February, is under severe criticism for
financial and other scandals involving him, his family members and
associates.
   The ex-president denied any wrongdoings while in office, but two
of his close family members have been arrested on charges of taking
bribes and misusing millions of dollars in official funds.

<HEAD>Johns' Painting Sets New High For A Contemporary Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the second day in a row, a record price was
paid for a Jasper Johns painting: $17.05 million for the oil titled,
``False Start,'' Sotheby's announced.
   The sale of the canvas painting, painted in 1959 shortly after
Johns' first one-man show at Leo Castelli Gallery in 1958, occurred
during a record-setting auction of contemporary art Thursday, said
Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America.
   It was the highest amount ever paid for a painting by a
contemporary artist, Ms. Brooks said.
   ``It was always a jewel,'' she said of the painting, which
features splashes of color and the angled stencils of the words of
various colors.
   The painting, which had been owned by private collectors, was
part of a $66.3 million sale that set a record for a contemporary
art auction, she said. She declined to name the winning bidder.
   More than 3,000 people crowded into a main hall and two other
sales rooms to participate in the bidding, she said.
   Ms. Brooks said it was ``one of the most amazing auctions'' she
had seen.
   ``The breadth of this market is something we had expected was
there, but it was confirmed tonight by the prices that were paid,''
Ms. Brooks said.
   Besides the contemporary art sale, a separate auction was
conducted for paintings from the collection of Victor W. Ganz, who
died in 1987.
   A dozen paintings from the collection, started in 1947, were sold
for $48.5 million. About $16 million of the amount was included in
the total for the night for contemporary art, bringing the total
night's sales to $98.5 million, said Sotheby's spokeswoman Diana
Levitt.
   Also at Thursday's sale, a record $3.96 million for an Andy
Warhol painting was paid for a silkscreen canvas titled, ``Marilyn
Monroe (Twenty Times),'' Ms. Levitt said. The painting shows the
face of the actress 20 times.
   Records were also set for 15 other artists, Ms. Levitt said.
   On Wednesday, a Swedish art collector paid $7.04 million for a
painting by Johns of an all-white American flag, Christie's said.
   Hans Thulin, chairman of a Swedish real estate conglomerate, put
down the winning bid for the painting, ``White Flag.''
   The sale price of ``White Flag,'' which was estimated to be worth
$5 million to $8 million, stood for one day as the most ever paid
for a work of contemporary art and the most ever paid for a work by
a living artist, according to Christie's.
   Johns' ``Diver,'' which sold for $4.18 million in May, held the
previous records.

<HEAD>Black South African Leader Seriously Ill, Says Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 75-year-old president of
the outlawed Pan Africanist Congress is seriously ill at a prison
near Johannesburg, newspapers reported today.
   The Sowetan and The Star quoted Urbania Mothopeng as saying her
husband, Zephania, had a ``swollen neck'' and his voice had
``dwindled to inaudible whimpers'' when she visited him last weekend.
   ``His condition was worse than when he was admitted to a
Johannesburg clinic in September, though his legs were not swollen
this time,'' the papers quoted her as saying.
   Mothopeng also was hospitalized in July, but the nature of his
illness has not been disclosed.
   He is held at Diepkloof Prison near Johannesburg.
   Mothopeng was sentenced in 1979 to a 15-year prison term for
furthering the aims of the outlawed Pan Africanist Congress, which
wages a campaign of sabotage to undermine the white-led government.
He was elected president of the exiled organization in 1986.
   The Prisons Service had no comment on Mothopeng's condition or on
Mrs. Mothopeng's comments that she has expected his release since
she was asked last year to sign a document saying she would be
responsible for his medical care.
   Mothopeng has actively opposed the government since the 1940s,
when he joined the African National Congress. He was a teacher fired
from his job in 1952 for his opposition to the government's
discriminatory education policies.
   With some other members, Mothopeng broke away from the African
National Congress in 1959 to form the Pan Africanist Congress, which
advocates black self-reliance and opposes the ANC's contacts with
activists of other races.
   Mothopeng is one of several imprisoned black activists whose
release is demanded by black politicians as a precondition for
negotiating with the government. Nelson Mandela, 70, the ANC leader
imprisoned since 1962, was convicted of plotting to overthrow the
government and given a life sentence.

<TEXT>
   Six Koreans from the communist north
and pro-Western south have sought political asylum in the United
States in the past two years, a leading South Korean newspaper said
today.
   The Joongang Daily News, quoting government sources it did not
identify, said the U.S. government still is reviewing the cases and
none of them has been granted asylum yet.
   It said four of the defectors were from the south and two from
the north.
   The sources obtained their information through the U.S. Embassy
in Seoul, the paper said. No independent confirmation of the report
was possible because the embassy was closed to observe Veterans' Day.
   Joongang said the U.S. State Department confirmed that the six
sought asylum between October 1986 and September this year, but
refused to identify them for security reasons.
   In Seoul, there was speculation that the South Korean defectors
may include prominent people who worked with former President Chun
Doo-hwan. A parliamentary committee currently is investigating Chun
for alleged corruption and other misdeeds during his seven-year term
in office, which ended in February.

   An official of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army escaped assassination when a bomb exploded near his
car, a statement from the militia said today.
   Beirut newspapers published the statement, which said the charge
went off Thursday as Alameddine Badawi and his bodyguard drove
through the western entrance to southern Hasbaya village.
   The men escaped unharmed but their car was damaged, the statement
said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, the second
attempt against South Lebanon Army officials this week.
   On Monday, a gunmen authorities identified as 21-year-old Soha
Fawaz Bishara shot and wounded the army's commander, Maj. Gen.
Antoine Lahd, at his home in Marjayoun, in Israel's self-designated
security zone.
   Israel radio reported today that Lahd, 61, still was in serious
but stable condition in the hospital.
   The Lebanese National Resistance Front, a coalition of
Syrian-backed leftist groups, claimed responsibility for the attack
on Lahd, saying it was in support of the 11-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip.

   A rare Indian rhinoceros apparently died of
shock after getting its head stuck in an 18-inch opening in a zoo
gate, officials said.
   The 2{-ton animal, which had lived at the Los Angeles Zoo for 19
years, had reared up and put its head through the opening, locking
its horn, said zoo director Warren Thomas.
   ``You're dealing with an animal with a relatively limited
intelligence level, and she panicked. It never occurred to her to
turn her head slightly sideways to slip her head out,'' Thomas said
Thursday.
   The animal, named Rhada, was found dead Thursday morning. It
apparently became trapped overnight. The rhino's air passages
remained open, indicating the animal died of shock and not
suffocation, said Thomas.
   The zoo has nighttime care for sick animals but no routine checks
for healthy ones. ``You don't want to disturb them,'' Thomas said.
``You don't want to spook them.''
   The 21-year-old rhino, born in India, was one of 75 in zoos
worldwide and one of few to breed successfully in captivity. About
2,000 of the endangered species live in the wild. Rhinos live to
about 40, Thomas said.
   ``It is a tragedy for us and a tragedy for the species because
she is one of the few successful breeders and her genes are real
valuable in a species survival program,'' said zoo spokeswoman Lora
La Marca.
   Rhada had given birth to two calves, including a 2-year-old male
that was with her in her pen when she became trapped, Thomas said.
   The zoo has two other Indian rhinos.

<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president today issued an emergency
decree saying that anyone convicted of instigating strikes will be
hanged.
   The president's office also said that anyone found guilty of
possessing leaflets or posters calling for strikes will be
imprisoned or hanged.
   The government of President Junius R. Jayewardene issued copies
of the decree after shops and businesses reopened following a
four-day strike called by Sinhalese extremists demanding
Jayewardene's resignation.
   On Thursday, soldiers killed 18 anti-government demonstrators who
defied curfews and marched through three Sinhalese towns. The
confrontation came one day after the army was ordered to shoot on
sight anyone staging demonstrations.
   The decree was issued under the state of emergency in effect
since 1983 when ethnic tensions in this once-placid, island nation
set off a chain of massacres, assassinations and guerrilla attacks.
   The presidential announcement said the new regulations would be
strictly enforced in the interests of ``the welfare of the people of
this country.''
   The army was ordered to arrest anyone carrying strike leaflets or
posters or displaying them inside or outside their homes, according
to the announcement by Jayewardene's office. Anyone found in
possession of such items was to be taken before a military tribunal
for immediate trial, and conviction could result in prison terms or
death by hanging.
   The decree also provides capital punishment for anyone convicted
of using persuasion or intimidation to keep people away from jobs
declared essential under emergency laws. These jobs include those in
public transport and distribution of food and fuel.
   Around-the-clock curfews were extended until 8 a.m. Saturday in
predominantly Sinhalese southern and central Sri Lanka.
   The People's Liberation Front, composed of Sinhalese extremists,
has vowed to keep calling strikes until Jayewardene _ himself a
Sinhalese _ dissolves Parliament and resigns, clearing the way for a
caretaker government representing all political parties to oversee
the Dec. 19 presidential elections. The strikes are usually
announced by leaflets or by posters that appear on walls overnight.
   Jayewardene, barred by the constitution from seeking a third
term, is not running for re-election, but the front claims his
government is incapable of conducting a fair election.
   The front opposes Jayewardene's peace overtures to Tamil
guerrillas fighting for a separate homeland in northern and eastern
Sri Lanka. More than 8,500 people, mostly Sinhalese civilians, have
been killed since Tamil guerrillas launched their separatist war in
1983.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the country's population of 16
million, claim the Sinhalese majority discriminates against them in
jobs and education. Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
population, hold most top government and military jobs.
   Fifteen months ago, under a peace plan brokered by India, the Sri
Lankan government offered a measure of autonomy to Tamils if their
fighters laid down their arms. The best-armed Tamil militants
rejected the offer and are now fighting Indian peacekeeping troops
sent to disarm them.
   The peace plan spurred a Sinhalese backlash against the
government. The People's Liberation Front vowed to kill anyone who
supported the proposal.
   Since then, more than 550 government officials and supporters
have been assassinated, and authorities blame the killings on the
front.

<TEXT>
   If there's one theme behind Californians
pummeling auto insurers and Michiganders striking a blow at
abortion, it's that many voters are growing fed up with legislatures
and are ready to take lawmaking into their own hands.
   So say experts on the initiative process as they survey the
results of the 229 statewide issues and hundreds of local questions
that citizens confronted on Election Day.
   ``It's definitely an expression of impatience with the regular
political process,'' says David Schmidt, editor of the newsletter
``Initiative and Referendum: The Power of the People'' published in
San Francisco _ the city where voters on Tuesday waded through no
less than 29 statewide initiatives and 24 local issues.
   Of the 229 statewide issues, a record 54 were citizen
initiatives, topping the previous high of 52 in 1982, according to
Pat McGuigan, an authority on ballot issues at the Washington-based
Institute for Government and Politics.
   Citizen initiatives find their way onto ballots mainly because
enough people believe they have a problem that they feel legislators
aren't doing much about _ soaring auto premiums in California, for
example.
   But that's not the entire explanation, said McGuigan.
   ``There are certainly elements of public disgust. But what you're
seeing now is that well-funded interest groups see this initiative
process as a good way to promote their agendas,'' he said.
   Such populist lawmaking is possible only in the 26 states plus
the District of Columbia where citizen initiatives are allowed.
Those states are mostly in the West and Midwest and the number
hasn't changed significantly in years.
   Some of this year's upsurge in initiative activity is simply the
normal pattern of having many more initiatives in even-numbered
years when voter turnout is heaviest. In 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1987,
there were six, five, four, and five citizen initiatives on state
ballots, respectively. But in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1988, there were
52, 40, 42 and 54.
   In the past, environmental activists have forced states to enact
bottle bills. The early 1980s saw scores of nuclear freeze
initiatives. Tax rebels have forced states to curb spending,
starting with California a decade ago.
   State legislative spokesmen don't deny the public's frustration
with their workings. But William Pound, executive director of the
National Conference of State Legislatures, said that increasingly it
is special interests who are turning to the initiative process after
failing to get their way in the statehouse.
   Even so, the failure of big money to sway voters in so many
ballot contests this year was extraordinary.
   On Tuesday, pro-life groups forced an end to state funding of
abortions in Michigan, Arkansas and Colorado. But trial lawyers
spent $15 million in a losing effort to promote an auto insurance
reform measure in California; in Florida doctors lost an expensive
battle to limit liability claims for bodily injury to $100,000 for
non-economic losses such as pain and suffering.
   Tobacco companies spent some $15 million opposing a 25-cent hike
in California's cigarette tax _ and lost.
   The National Rifle Association spent upwards of $4 million to get
Maryland voters to repeal its new law banning cheap handguns _ and
lost also.
   California's auto insurance battle was the bitterest and most
expensive of all.
   ``People had a real financial incentive in this,'' said Schmidt.
``The legislature couldn't or wouldn't do anything about (rising
auto premiums). Trial lawyers fought the insurance lobby to a
standoff.''
   The result was that Californians decided to tackle the issue
themselves. They chose among five ballot measures, some backed by
the legal community, some by the auto insurers, and one by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader.
   As with gun control in Maryland and tort reform in Florida, the
side with the least money won the most votes. The Nader-backed issue
cutting auto rates by at least 20 percent defeated rival measures
that insurers and trial lawyers had spent $75 million unsuccessfully
promoting.
   Usually, nothing has talked louder or more successfully in the
initiative process than money, says Thomas E. Cronin, a political
scientist at Colorado College who is finishing a book on the
initiative process.
   ``Money plays an important role in almost all aspects of direct
democracy devices,'' Cronin wrote recently. ``Money may not always
be a decisive factor, yet money, especially large amounts of money,
well spent can usually defeat ballot questions.''
   That citizen action triumphed in 1988 over money in several cases
hasn't erased other concerns some have raised about the growth of
the initiative process.
   Some fear initiatives are a vehicle for majorities to tyrannize
minorities. Homosexuals aren't the nation's most popular group, and
sure enough, a gay rights measure lost in Oregon on Tuesday.
   ``But that happens in legislatures, too,'' said Schmidt. ``I just
don't buy the argument that voters are so much more emotional or
anti-minority than legislators.''

   A South African delegation met with U.S. and Soviet
officials today, hoping that agreement could be reached on a
timetable for a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and for granting
independence to South-West Africa.
   Another meeting of officials from South Africa, Cuba, Angola and
the United States, which is mediating the talks, was planned a South
African spokesman said. The spokesman, Roland Darrol, said the South
African delegation came to Geneva ``in a positive frame of mind.''
   He said the head of the South African delegation, Neil van
Heerden, director-general of the department of foreign affairs, met
with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker today. The
South Africans also met with a Soviet observer delegation, he said.
   The sides are trying to achieve agreement on a withdrawal of an
estimated 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, where they are backing
the Marxist government. South Africa links independence for
South-West Africa to the troop withdrawal.
   South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, is controlled by South
Africa in violation of a U.N. resolution for independence there.
   The Soviet deputy foreign minister, Anatoly Adamishin, said
Thursday the only remaining issue at the talks is the timing of a
Cuban troop withdrawal.
   A U.S. proposal made in early October reportedly calls on Cuba to
withdraw half of its troops from Angola by Aug. 1, with the
remaining troops to be stationed in northern Angola and withdrawn in
stages by the end of 1990.
   Cuba reportedly wants a 30-month timetable, compared to the 24
months sought by the United States and South Africa.
   A U.S. proposal last month reportedly suggested Jan. 1 as a
target date for independence in South-West Africa, with elections
scheduled Aug. 1.
   Adamishin, speaking through an interpreter Thursday night,
expressed ``cautious optimism'' that agreement on a troop withdrawal
could be reached during the Geneva session, which is scheduled to
end Sunday.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mild weather and curiosity
about the damage from last summer's fires helped Yellowstone
National Park set an attendance record in October, officials say.
   Attendance in October increased by almost 50,000 people, or more
than 39 percent, compared to the same month last year, the park said
in a statement Thursday.
   Fires blackened more than a third of the 2.2 million-acre park
and closed most of its major tourist areas during the summer.
   The park said 175,019 people visited the park in October,
compared to a total of 125,597, which had been the previous record
for October. In the last 10 years, an average of 100,500 people
visited the park in the tenth month.
   ``Park officials attribute the significant increase in October
visitation to warm weather and the many visitors wishing to view the
park after the fires,'' the release said.
   The October figures bring the number of people to visit the park
during its summer season, May 1 to Oct. 31, to almost 2.07 million,
a 16.05 percent decline from 1987. The summer attendance record,
2.47 million, was set in 1978.
   The 1988 summer attendance represented only a 5 percent decline
from the 10-year average of almost 2.17 million, said Robert Barbee,
park superintendent.

   The army imposed curfews and travel restrictions
in the occupied lands today and deployed soldiers in Jerusalem's old
Walled City to prevent violence linked to the expected proclamation
of a Palestinian state.
   Troops rounded up hundreds of Palestinians in anticipation of
anti-Israeli demonstrations during the four-day session of the
Palestine National Council, the parliament-in-exile of the PLO.
   The council is expected to declare an independent Palestinian
state during its meeting, which begins Saturday in Algiers.
   Palestinians were not allowed to enter Jerusalem from the West
Bank and could move only within their own districts.
   Hundreds of soldiers in combat gear and armed with assault rifles
were deployed in the Old City, which has a large Arab population.
Dozens of border police, many carrying automatic weapons fitted with
grenade launchers, patrolled the streets.
   Troops put up three checkpoints on the Bethlehem-Jerusalem
highway, turning away Jerusalem-bound cars with blue West Bank
license plates, Arab witnesses said.
   In an unusual move, troops also questioned drivers of
yellow-plated Israeli cars and in one instance ordered an Arab
laborer riding in a car with his Israeli employer to stay behind.
   Border police patrolled the narrow alleys of Bethlehem, and two
army jeeps escorted each Israeli bus passing through the biblical
city.
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, troops at checkpoints turned
back many residents, and soldiers on foot checked ID cards. Graffiti
sprayed on walls read: ``Yes to the PNC'' and ``Yes to the
Independent State.''
   In the Gaza Strip, the army clamped curfews on all eight refugee
camps, confining more than 250,000 of Gaza's 650,000 residents to
their homes.
   A spokesman said an indefinite curfew would be imposed on the
entire coastal strip at 9 p.m. and journalists would be barred from
entering without an army escort.
   Arab reports said Israeli authorities disconnected the
loudspeakers of seven mosques in the Gaza Strip in an attempt to
prevent Moslem preachers from reaching a large number of worshipers
during noon prayers. The army said it was checking the report.
   Throughout the occupied lands, hundreds of Palestinian activists
were rounded up overnight, Arab reports said. In the West Bank
refugee camps of Kalandia, Jalazoon and Al Amari, troops imposed
brief curfews to make the arrests. An army official would only say
that Israel has ``ongoing initiatives to round up troublemakers.''
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron toured the Gaza Strip on
Thursday and on Israel army radio he warned Palestinians that ``our
forces ... will not allow any illegal activity.''
   The expected unilateral declaration of independence implicitly
recognizes Israel and has created a rift between Palestinian
moderates and hardliners.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Hamas (Zeal) movement, only recently
reconciled with PLO factions, criticized that organization for
proposing peace talks.
   ``We announce clearly: No to a Zionist state in the land of
Palestine, no to peace with murderers ... Yes to the armed
struggle,'' Hamas said in a leaflet distributed in the occupied
lands.

<TEXT>
   A long-term study of women with silicone breast
implants shows no support for newly expressed concerns about a
cancer risk, and 25 years of experience also shows the implants are
safe, plastic surgeons say.
   ``We certainly wouldn't do it (implant surgery) if we thought
there was a significant risk,'' said George Reading, president of
the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
   An estimated 2 million women have received silicone implants,
with 130,000 procedures done every year. Most are for cosmetic
purposes, and the rest for reconstruction after breast surgery.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group, a private health
advocacy organization, called this week for a ban on silicone
implants, which they said may give a risk of cancer and other health
problems.
   The group contacted the Food and Drug Administration, which had
already scheduled a review of the devices. An FDA document said the
agency ``has been increasingly concerned about reports of adverse
effects from breast implants.''
   Implants are small bags, filled with clear silicone gel, placed
surgically behind breasts to make them appear larger. The procedure
can cost up to around $6,000, Reading said Thursday.
   The FDA said it wants manufacturers of the implants to furnish
scientific data to demonstrate the devices are safe and effective.
   Among other concerns, it cited a study that showed the gel can
produce tumors in laboratory rats. ``Although it is unlikely that
this finding is relevant to humans, the possibility of a cancer risk
cannot be completely ruled out,'' the FDA said.
   The type of tumor seen in the rats is common in rodents but not
in humans, said Thomas Krizek, chairman of the surgery department at
the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago.
   Krizek, who has investigated effects of implants in rodents, and
Reading said they have never heard of a woman with an implant
getting that kind of tumor.
   In addition, no significantly higher rates for any kind of cancer
have emerged from a study of about 3,100 implant recipients in Los
Angeles County, said Gary Brody, clinical professor of plastic
surgery at the University of Southern California.
   The women have been followed for 12 years on average after their
implants, and up to 25 years, he said.
   FDA also expressed concerns about fibrous tissue growing around
the implants and causing painful hardening in the breast, the
possibility that gel will leak from the implant and possibly cause
problems with the immune system or a fetus, and the potential of
implants to interfere with the use of X-rays to spot early breast
cancers.
   Fibrous tissue grows around an implant as a natural reaction by
the body, Brody said. Probably less than 10 percent of implant
recipients experience pain or other discomfort, he said.
   ``Every woman is told it's a risk'' before surgery, he said.
Sometimes the problem can be remedied without removing the implant,
but if that fails, most women choose to leave the implant in, he
said.
   Gel has been found in lymph nodes, but the idea of spread beyond
that is only theoretical, Brody said. There is no evidence of any
effect on a fetus, he said.
   Only isolated cases of immune system disturbance have been
proposed as linked to implants, and the evidence is ``not very
convincing,'' he said.
   As for interfering with breast X-rays, Robert McLelland, chairman
of the American College of Radiology's committee on breast imaging,
said implants make for ``a very difficult exam'' because they can
hide breast tissue.
   Implanted women who want a breast X-ray should ask if the
radiologist is familiar with special techniques to remedy the
problem, he said.
   If the radiologist says no, or that no special techniques are
required, ``that would be reason to look elsewhere'' for the X-ray,
he said.

<TEXT>
   The president of parliament resigned
today under attack for saying _ on the 50th anniversary of the
Kristallnacht pogrom against the Jews _ that many Germans initially
found Hitler's rule ``glorious.''
   Parliament President Philipp Jenninger's speech also called the
early years of the Nazi's Third Reich a ``triumphal procession.''
   In his resignation statement, Jenninger, who also condemned the
Nazi pogram in his address Thursday, said he was misunderstood.
   Nevertheless, his speech was criticized throughout the country
and abroad.
   ``This event shows us how the darkest chapter of German history
is still a present-day thing,'' Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the
opposition Social Democratic Party, said after Jenninger's
resignation.
   ``We must now work even harder with others to learn how to live
and worthily deal with this challenge,'' Vogel told reporters.
   The leftist Greens Party said in a statement: ``The background of
what happened is the inability of many Germans to stand up to their
own past. We hope ... a discussion about guilt and responsibility
for this recent history will take place.''
   The furor overshadowed West Germany's carefully organized
ceremonies marking Kristallnacht, the night of terror against the
Jews that signaled the start of the Holocaust.
   Communist East Germany's official news agency ADN called the
Jenninger speech ``a scandal.'' Israel's Foreign Ministry called the
incident ``unacceptable and unfortunate.''
   ``It's a scandal, it's a shame,'' said Frankfurt Jewish community
spokesman Michel Friedman, a member of Jenniger's party, the
Christian Democrats.
   Jenniger said he was misunderstood. ``My speech was not
understood by many listeners the way I had intended it to be,'' the
56-year-old politician said in a written statement announcing his
resignation. ``I am deeply sorry and I am very hurt, if I have
offended the feelings of others.''
   His speech, at a special session of the Bundestag, or parliament,
caused a walkout by about 50 lawmakers and calls for his resignation.
   He added: ``During my whole political career _ most recently as
president of the German Parliament _ I have been active in working
for reconciliation with the Jews and for the vital interests of the
state of Israel.''
   Jenninger said he was stepping down as Bundestag president
because he wanted to avoid damage to the office and because he
believed he lost the trust of many colleagues.
   Jenninger had been the No. 2 West German official after President
Richard von Weizsaecker, under the nation's rules of diplomatic
protocal.
   A member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats,
Jenninger has been a lawmaker since 1969 and was one of Kohl's
closest aides before he was elected Bundestag president in November
1984.
   In his speech Thursday, Jenninger talked at length about the
positive feelings of many ordinary Germans early in the Hitler
dictatorship.
   ``Didn't Hitler bring to reality what (Kaiser) Wilhelm II had
only promised, that is to lead the Germans to glorious times? Wasn't
he chosen by Providence, a Fuehrer such as is given to a people only
once in a thousand years?'' Jenninger asked.
   ``For the fate of the Germans and European Jews, Hitler's
successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and
misdeeds,'' Jenninger said.
   ``The years from 1933 to 1938, even from a distant retrospective
and in the knowledge of what followed, still are a fascinating thing
today, since throughout history there was hardly a parallel to
Hitler's triumphant procession during the first years.''
   Some listeners sobbed when Jenninger read an eyewitness account
of the murder of concentration camp victims in 1942.
   ``Blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone,'' he
read. ``Some of those shot were still moving, some lifted their arms
and turned their heads, to show they were still alive.''
   Social Democratic chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel said in a letter to
Jenninger that the Parliament president showed a ``disturbing lack
of judgment.''
   World Jewish Congress President Edgar M. Bronfman called
Jenninger's remarks ``reprehensible.''
   But a leader of West Germany's Jewish community defended
Jenninger's speech, saying he could not understand calls for his
resignation.
   ``I welcome that the parliament president described in full
clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938,'' said
Michael Fuerst, a deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
West Germany.
   Starting with the Kristallnacht of Nov. 9-10, 1938, the Nazis
made clear their intentions to wipe out European Jews. On that
night, Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues,
sending 30,000 Jews to concentration camps and killing 91 Jews.
   Shattered glass covered the streets and the Nazis, mockingly,
named it Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night. The Nazis killed 6 million
Jews and many others during Hitler's rule from 1933 to 1945.

<HEAD>Search Continues But Little Hope For 27 Crewmen on Tanker</HEAD>

   A Canadian plane and a Soviet ship searched today
for 27 crewmen from a tanker that broke in two in the stormy north
Atlantic, but authorities said there was little chance they would
find survivors.
   ``It doesn't look like there's any possibility of finding
anybody,'' said Capt. Mort MacDonnell of the Canadian Search and
Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
   ``The indications are there was a bad fire on the vessel and the
two empty lifeboats which were found were burned,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   All 27 Greek and Honduran crew members were on the stern section
of the 65,746-ton Odyssey when it broke in two Wednesday and burst
into flames, British-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said.
   The Canadians told British coast guard officials that the fire
started in the stern section and then ignited the oil surrounding
the vessel, spreading the fire onto the ocean surface, Lloyd's said.
The fire burned for hours.
   The bow section of the Liberian-registered tanker remained afloat
until early Wednesday evening when it sank, MacDonnell said.
   Polembros Shipping Ltd. of London, operators of the Odyssey, said
the tanker had a Greek captain, 14 Greek officers and 12 Honduran
sailors.
   ``They haven't found any survivors but they're going to search
again today,'' said a spokeswoman, commenting on condition she was
not identified. ``All the families have been notified. But there
isn't much hope, I'm afraid.''
   Two Canadian military search planes returned to Halifax at
nightfall Wednesday but the Soviet weather ship Passat, the first
ship on the scene, remained in the area, 1,000 miles east of
Newfoundland.
   The Passat was 26 miles away when the distress signal was sent
out and rushed to help, but flaming oil kept it from getting closer
than a mile from the stricken vessel, said British and Canadian
coast guard officials.

   Shots were fired from a speeding vehicle
at the Khartoum residence of Mohammed Osman al-Mirghani, one of
Sudan's most prominent political and religious leaders, police
sources said today.
   There were no casualties in the Thursday night shooting, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said witnesses
saw three gunmen open fire from a pickup truck, which fled at high
speed.
   The police informants said al-Mirghani was not in the house at
the time.
   Al-Mirghani is leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, the
second-largest partner in the cabinet coalition and in parliament
after the Umma Party of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi. The
Democratic Unionist Party strongly advocates close relations between
Sudan and Egypt.
   Al-Mirghani also is leader of Khatmiya, one of Sudan's two
principal Moslem sects. El-Mahdi leads the other sect, Ansar.
   The police sources said security forces rushed to al-Mirghani's
residence after the shooting, blocked streets leading to it and
began searching for the attack vehicle.
   They said investigators at the scene counted 18 spent shells
believed to have been fired from AK-47 automatic rifles.
   Al-Mirghani planned to leave early Saturday for Addis Ababa,
capital of neighboring Ethiopia, for talks with John Garang, leader
of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting
government troops in southern Sudan since 1983. The police sources
said authorities were investigating possible motives for the
shooting, including al-Mirghany's peace mission.

   China said today that 71 people were injured in a
strong earthquake that struck off its southeastern coast, and the
number reported homeless from an earlier quake on the southern
border doubled to 200,000.
   The official China News Service said several buildings were
cracked and stairways collapsed in the Guangxi Zhuang region during
Thursday's quake, which measured slightly more than 5 on the Richter
scale.
   It occurred four days after a quake near the Burmese border
killed more than 930 people.
   No deaths were immediately reported in Thursday's quake, but 71
people were were hurt, nine seriously, as they scrambled from
buildings in the city of Fangcheng, the report said. It said the
trade city of Canton also was shaken by the quake, which was
centered offshore in the Beibu Gulf.
   Seismologists said the quake may have been an aftershock of the
Sunday quake that devastated dozens of remote towns and farming
villages in Yunnan province, west of Guangxi Zhuang. That quake
measured 7.6 on the Richter scale.
   More than 930 people were killed in that quake, according to a
preliminary count. The official China News Service quoted Yunnan
officials as raising the count of those injured by several hundred,
to 3,261.
   Trevor Page of the U.N. World Food Program said today that
Chinese officials told him 200,000 people were homeless from the
quake, twice as many as previously reported.
   Page said the Ministry of Civil Affairs sent his office a
detailed list of emergency supply needs, including antibiotics,
syringes, portable X-rays, jeeps, plastic sheets, tents, clothing
and canned food.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday that 75 tons of
medicine and 24 tons of food already had been sent to the quake area
by helicopter, truck and horse-drawn cart. Many villages in the area
can reached only on footpaths and the few existing roads have been
heavily damaged by the quake.
   Xinhua and government offices said they had no updates today on
the death toll. count of dead and injured. Xinhua acknowledged many
remote villages had not yet been reached by rescue teams and that
the casualty figures were expected to rise.
   A strong quake hit the same area of Yunnan in October, and a
quake measuring 5 on the Richter scale hit the Beibu Gulf on
Saturday, one day before the big Yunnan quake.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the strength of an earthquake,
and a quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas.
One measuring 7 is 10 times as strong.

   Financially troubled Avtex Inc., the sole
supplier of rayon yarn used in the space shuttle, has a week to
prove it can make a go of it or give the product rights to NASA
under a $7 million rescue by the agency.
   The money from NASA allowed Avtex to recall 1,300 workers
Thursday at its Front Royal plant, which had closed a week earlier.
   ``I don't look at it as a bailout, because every time we give
them something, they give us something in return,'' said J.R.
Thompson, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala. ``We're not in the bailout business.''
   Avtex, based in Valley Forge, Pa., is the sole supplier of the
fiber, used in rocket nozzles for the shuttle and an array of
missiles. NASA has said it has enough of the material on hand for 10
more shuttle flights.
   After NASA gives Avtex the $7 million, the company will have
until Nov. 18 to demonstrate that it will generate enough other
contracts to stay in business, Thompson said. If Avtex cannot do so,
NASA will take the rights to the fiber.
   ``They transfer the rights to NASA as well as the cookbook to
making this rayon fiber to our technical specifications,'' Thompson
said.
   If Avtex convinces NASA it will stay alive, NASA will sign an $11
million contract for more fiber, Thompson said.
   Avtex, in closing last week, blamed a drop in business from the
Challenger disaster, foreign competition for its other products and
environmental regulations that have led to numerous pollution
problems.
   Analysts who study the aerospace industry said that such
dependence on one producer of a vital product is not unheard of.
   During the summer, NASA provided money to rocket maker Morton
Thiokol Inc., which then loaned it to Pacific Engineering and
Production Co. for the rebuilding of a rocket fuel plant that blew
up in Nevada.
   ``It is amazing,'' said Paul Nisbet of Prudential Bache
Securities Inc. ``We've got lots of areas in the whole aerospace and
military industries where there are a lot of potential problems if
sources disappear from view.''
   ``We fight these fires one at a time,'' Thompson said.

<TEXT>
   Authorities threw a gala celebration today,
including a rare televised Mass and a military parade in Victory
Square, to mark the 70th anniversary of the rebirth of the Polish
state.
   In was the most elaborate celebration ever under communist
authorities to mark the 1918 creation of the capitalist, anti-Soviet
republic in Poland between the two world wars. It also was the first
time such lavish attention has been paid to Poland's leader between
the wars, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski.
   A Roman Catholic ``Mass for the Fatherland'' celebrated by the
country's chief military chaplain was televised.
   Legions of goose-stepping soldiers marched in Victory Square.
   The celebration sharply contrasted with treatment of the
anniversary in the past. Private groups who tried to organize
marches on the date every year after 1974 faced sharp repressions.
   Official attitudes toward the holiday have softened in the
aftermath of the 1981 declaration of martial law, with the
government embracing popular patriotic symbols and urging national
unity.
   On Nov. 11, 1918, a civil council in Warsaw turned over military
power to Pilsudski, who had just been released from a German prison
at the end of World War I. Pilsudski proclaimed an independent
Polish state and disarmed the remaining German troops in the capital.
   The reestablishment of Poland after 123 years of being
partitioned among Prussia, Austria and Russia fulfilled the dream of
generations of patriots.
   On the broad expanse of Victory Square, Communist Party leader
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, wearing his army uniform and accompanied
by Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, presided at the hourlong
official ceremonies.
   Honor guards representing various branches and divisions of the
military paid homage to the nation, and ambassadors to Poland laid
wreathes at the unknown soldier's tomb, which was guarded by
soldiers in uniforms from different epochs of Polish history.
   ``We have fought long for recognizing the day of Nov. 11 as a
national holiday,'' said Wojciech Ziembinski, an anti-communist
historian who began organizing marches on the date in 1974, often
spending months in jail for it.
   ``Today we can see the effects of our bloodless fight. Even those
who exercise power in Poland authorized by a foreign power had to
accept the Polish tradition,'' he said in a telephone interview from
his home.
   On Wednesday, an independent member of the Sejm, or parliament,
moved that the government declare Nov. 11 an official state holiday
as it was before World War II. However, that seemed unlikely to
happen. Acting Labor Minister Jerzy Szreter said Thursday that an
additional holiday would cost $167 million and noted that Poland

<TEXT>
   Parliament President Philipp Jenninger,
whose remarks about Germany's Nazi past ended his 25-year political
career, once said he became a public servant because of his father's
opposition to World War II.
   Jenninger resigned today after he was sharply criticized over a
speech he gave Thursday in which he reminded his audience that
Hitler's rule was ``glorious'' in the view of many Germans.
Jenninger, who also criticized the Nazis, made the speech during a
ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night
that began the Holocaust.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl also criticized his close friend and
former aide over the tone of the speech, the conservative Die Welt
newspaper said.
   In his resignation announcement, Jenninger said today that he has
always been an opponent of ``every type of totalitarian rule'' and
that he has been a consistent supporter of Israel.
   Jenninger, in a 1982 interview with West German reporters, said
he went into public service because his father told him the world
must avoid another war like the one started by Nazi Germany in 1939.
   ``Two of my brothers died in the war. My father told me when I
was 12: `Be of service during your lifetime, so that something like
this can never again happen.' That influenced me,'' Jenninger said
then.
   Jenninger, a 56-year-old member of Kohl's conservative Christian
Democratic Union, rode to the highest position in the Bundestag, or
parliament, on a reputation for fairness and effectiveness.
   As a close aide to Kohl, Jenninger was a leading figure behind
persuading East Germany to let more of its people visit or move to
West Germany.
   Jenninger was also involved in preparations for a planned 1984
visit to West Germany of East German leader Erich Honecker, but the
Soviet Union vetoed the trip. Honecker did finally travel to West
Germany in 1987 _ the first East German leader ever to do so.
   Jenninger was born June 10, 1932 in Rindelbach, in what is now
Baden-Wuerttenberg state.
   He received his doctor of law degree in 1957 from the University
of Tuebingen.
   Jenninger began his political career in 1963 as an adviser in the
Defense Ministry.
   From 1966-69, Jenninger worked as a political adviser to
then-Finance Minister Franz Josef Strauss, a powerful
arch-conservative politician who died last month.
   Jenninger won a seat in the Bundestag in 1969 and has been a
member ever since.
   He became the Christian Democratic Union's chief parliamentary
secretary in the Bundestag in 1975, in charge of coordinating the
party's parliamentary affairs.
   When Kohl became chancellor in October 1982, he awarded Jenninger
for his efforts by giving him the high-powered job of state minister
in the Chancellery.
   Jenninger became Bundestag president on Nov. 5, 1984, after
Rainer Barzel quit the post in a corruption scandal.
   The Bundestag members elected Jenninger president with 340 of 469
votes, reflecting the confidence his colleagues had in him.
   The respected Die Zeit newspaper said at the time that Kohl may
have lost Jenninger as his right-hand man, but that Jenninger was an
``emergency victim for the sake of parliament.''

<HEAD>European Human Rights Commission Will Hear Soering Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Human Rights Commission
said today it will review the case of a West German who is fighting
extradition to the United States, where he is wanted for a double
slaying.
   Jens Soering allegedly helped his U.S. girlfriend kill her
parents in 1985 in Virginia's Bedford County.
   The son of a West German diplomat, Soering lives in London, where
he is fighting extradition to the United States.
   He has appealed to the European Human Rights Commission, arguing
that if extradited he faces a possible death penalty in Virginia.
   Neither Britain nor West Germany have capital punishment.
   The European Human Rights Commission is a body of the 21-nation
Council of Europe. Founded in 1949, the council is the oldest
organization for European unity though its work has been eclipsed in
recent decades by the European Economic Community, or Common Market,
which is a separate organization.
   A spokesman for the European Human Rights Commission's office in
London said the commission has agreed to review Soering's case and
to try to reach an settlement between Soering and Britain.
   The human rights commission's office in Strasbourg was closed for
the Armistice Day public holiday.
   If no amicable settlement can be reached, the human rights
commission will likely send Soering's case to the European Court of
Human Rights for a ruling.
   But that is unlikely to happen before next spring and the case
may remain before the court for months, if not years. Some cases
have taken up to six years to come to a ruling.

<TEXT>
   The local medical society has thrown
its support behind 24 obstetricians accused of violating state and
federal antitrust law by conspiring to boycott Massachusetts Blue
Shield.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon filed the suit
against the doctors in federal court Aug. 31, seeking civil
penalties of $30,000 each.
   The 700-member Hampden District Medical Society said the suit was
the first of its kind in Massachusetts. Blue Shield's rates are set
by a quasi-public commission.
   ``Apparently a state-supported monopoly doesn't bother the
attorney general, but he feels that if any two physicians talk about
anything in the corridors, that's collusion,'' said Dr. J. Gordon
Rich, president of the medical society.
   ``We feel there is no conspiracy and the First Amendment rights
of these doctors to free speech have been ignored and trod upon,''
Rich said. ``We feel it is an effort to intimidate and browbeat this
group of physicians and ultimately the entire profession.''
   Rich said area doctors have privately established a fund drive
for the legal defense of the doctors.
   The attorney general accused the doctors of acting together to
protest cost-containment efforts by Blue Shield, which denies
payment for procedures it considers unnecessary and refuses to
compensate non-participating physicians.
   The two dozen physicians, or more than two-thirds of the
obstetricians in the city, had notified the insurer in 1985 and 1986
that they planned to resign. Blue Shield requires a year's notice
and only two physicians actually left the program.
   Doctors who withdraw or threaten to withdraw from an insurance
plan undermine coverage for others and cause higher insurance
premiums, Shannon said.
   But Rich said, ``To the best of my knowledge there was never any
disruption of service to any Blue Shield patients.''
   An attorney for the doctors, Francis D. Dibble, said the doctors
made up their minds about Blue Shield independently and for a
variety of reasons.
   ``Some said they felt Blue Shield was an arrogant and poorly run
organization,'' he said, ``others said reimbursements were too low,
and others were pressured by rising malpractice insurance rates.''

<HEAD>American Legion Study Shows Suffering Of Vietnam Combat Vets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam veterans who were heavily exposed to
the herbicide Agent Orange show ``clear physical effects'' with
rashes, fatty tumors and changes in skin color, according to a study
released today.
   The study, sponsored by the American Legion, said that combat
veterans were also more likely to still be suffering from physical
and psychological problems related to their war experiences.
   Based on interviews with 6,810 American Legion members from six
states, the study found that many Vietnam veterans who took part in
what was called ``high combat'' continue to suffer from post
traumatic stress disorder.
   ``Left alone, PTSD does not abate,'' said American Legion
National Commander H.F. Gierke in a news release. ``There are
thousands of Vietnam veterans who are living in America, but they
are not living the American dream.''
   The findings are in a five-year study conducted by Steven D.
Stellman of the New York City Department of Health, and Jeanne Mager
Stellman of Columbia University and published today in the
scientific journal Environmental Research.
   Of the veterans interviewed for the study, 42 percent, or 2,858,
served in Southeast Asia. About 20 percent of this number were
classified in the study as ``high combat,'' which means they were
involved frequently in active combat where people were being killed
and their lives were in danger.
   The study also found a correlation between high rates of exposure
to the herbicide Agent Orange and some physical problems. These
findings contradict studies conducted by the military in which
physical complaints by Vietnam veterans were followed up with
physical examinations at Veterans Administration h ospitals. These
federal studies found no correlation between Agent Orange exposure
and ill health.
   Overall, the American Legion study said, men who served in
Southeast Asia had higher incidence of heart disease, benign fatty
tumors, skin rash with blisters and an increased light senstivity in
the eyes. Herbicide handlers, the study said, had a higher level of
ulcers and high blood pressure, and there was a correlation between
skin ailments and the levels of Agent Orange exposure.
   Other findings reported in the study include:
   _Veterans who experienced ``high combat'' were more apt to have
high levels of depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms of
depression than those who saw little combat or did not serve in
Southeast Asia.
   _High combat veterans were more likely to be heavy smokers and
drinkers and have a more difficult time reducing consumption. High
combat veterans were twice as likely to take tranquilizers or
sleeping pills, but illicit drug use was found to be very low.
   _The post traumatic stress disorder rate varied from 1.8 to 15
percent, depending on the level of combat, and the symptoms for some
of those interviewed have persisted for as long as 20 years.

<HEAD>Troops Mistake Soldier For IRA Guerrilla, Shoot Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British troops shot and
seriously wounded an off-duty British soldier they mistook for a
guerrilla during an IRA assault on a military base, authorities said
today.
   The soldier, who was not in uniform, rushed out of Rosemont base
in Londonderry after several shots were fired at the base Thursday
night, the police and army said in a joint statement.
   He was shot by a member of an army patrol that was responding to
the attack, the statement said.
   The injured soldier, who was not identified, ``had responded with
considerable initiative and courage by taking his weapon and going
out into Creggan Road'' outside the base, the statement said.
   ``One must assume at this moment that the military patrol saw an
armed man in the shadows and unfortunately fired,'' a press
spokesman at the British army's headquarters in Lisburn told The
Associated Press.
   The soldier was in serious condition at the city's Altnagelvin
Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   The Irish Republican Army, fighting to drive the British out of
Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for the base attack.
   On Tuesday night, the IRA set off a car bomb at a military
housing complex at Campsie, four miles outside Londonderry, and
caused extensive damage. Two policemen were treated for shock and a
soldier sustained cuts.
   The IRA took responsibility for the bombing and warned the
families of British soldiers to get out of Northern Ireland or face
further attack.

<TEXT>
   A businessman who bequeathed $100,000 to
his small community didn't bother to shelter his $69 million estate,
meaning the village will get an additional $6 million in taxes,
officials said.
   ``Oh, my, do we need it,'' Cadiz Mayor John Migliore said
Thursday. ``What we're going to try to do is use it to create jobs
by attracting industry. That's how we can put some of this into
people's pockets.''
   Robert Fleagane, who once counted among his holdings the R&F Coal
Co. and a Columbus insurance company, died Jan. 31 at age 69.
   The village got its first check this month, the bulk of an
initial payment of $2.5 million. The state eventually will get $2.5
million.
   Fleagane had given a pool to the local community center and
helped build a hospital in the eastern Ohio village of 3,800, but
his will took officials by surprise.
   ``That man did not shy away from inheritance taxes. He didn't
shelter it to avoid them,'' said Harris County Treasurer Michael
Cope, who is in charge of investing the money.
   ``I don't know if it was intentional, but I do know he believed
in paying taxes and never taking anything from the government.''
   The village, which has one of the state's highest unemployment
rates, plans to erect a building to house potential industry and
will update its sewage plant and water treatment plant, Migliore
said.
   ``Anybody else in his position would have extraordinary efforts
to shield the estate from inheritance taxes,'' Cope said. ``He chose
to live here even after he sold R&F and he could have lived in
Florida. Robert Fleagane was a special man.''

<HEAD>Church of England Votes to Triple Blacks in Synod</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Church of England leaders have voted to triple the
number of blacks on their policy-making synod, a move deplored as
``the reverse of apartheid'' by the Conservative government's
representative.
   With little more than half its members present Thursday, the
synod voted 214-74 with 11 abstentions to have at least 24 black
representatives on the 574-member General Synod. The synod currently
has eight black members.
   ``Black people in our midst have a great contribution to make,''
said the Most Rev. John Habgood, archbishop of York. ``We need to
increase their representation in the church as a whole.''
   He said the move would encourage blacks to run for election to
the synod in their church parishes.
   The vote followed a report from the church's Committee for Black
Anglican Concerns, which proposed the change for the next synod
elections in 1990. If 24 blacks are not elected in 1990, the minimum
will be achieved by appointing unsuccessful black candidates with
the highest number of votes.
   Paul Rippon, an English barrister, called the proposal ``deeply
insulting to black people, because it suggests they cannot get into
the synod on their merits.''
   But Barbados-born Wilfred Wood, bishop of Croydon and the
church's first black bishop to serve in England, said after the
vote, ``I'm gratified. ... I hope black people will come forward and
take their places in the Church of England.'' He heads the Committee
for Black Anglican Concerns.
   There are no statistics on how many blacks are in the Church of
England, which has about 1 million regular Sunday worshipers.
   Wood's committee estimates blacks account for about 7 percent of
England's 49 million people. It said the synod's standing committee
suggested it choose a figure. ``We believe that not less than 24 is
about right,'' the report said.
   John Gummer, the Conservative local government minister and a
leading synod member, called it ``apartheid in reverse,'' or reverse
discrimination.
   Joan Wakeling, a deaconess, agreed. ``We are going to need a lot
of work from the lawyers. If we vote for discrimination on behalf of
black people we could find ourselves setting an unhappy precedent.''
   Gummer said the problem is that not enough blacks ran for the
synod, and the church should do more by asking blacks to be synod
candidates.
   Before the debate, synod officials who took legal advice on the
proposal were told by barrister Anthony Lester that by giving
special provision to blacks, they probably would contravene the 1976
Race Relations Act, designed to bring about racial equality for the
country's ethnic minorities.
   Lester advised that the synod's attorneys could probably frame a
measure to circumvent the act, which would require parliamentary
approval.
   The church's laws and changes to them must be approved by
Parliament because the church is a state church with the monarch at
its head.

   Surgeons at a hospital here implanted human fetal
cells in a man's brain in hopes of easing symptoms of Parkinson's
disease, an experimental procedure attempted previously in Mexico
and Sweden, doctors say.
   The 52-year-old Denver man, whose name was not released, was in
good condition today at the University of Colorado Health Sciences
Center, said Missy Crim, a hospital spokeswoman.
   A team headed by Dr. Curt Freed performed the eight-hour
operation Wednesday. The patient has suffered from Parkinson's for
20 years.
   ``We don't expect our patient to improve for three to six
months,'' said Freed. Doctors said they are unsure how much function
will be restored.
   Parkinson's disease, which affects an estimated 500,000 people in
the United States, from degenerative loss of brain cells that
produce a message-carrying substance called dopamine.
   Freed said his experiments on monkeys indicate fetal tissue
implanted in the brain can produce dopamine and possibly curtail
Parkinson's symptoms, which include tremors, slow movement, rigidity
in the limbs and stooped posture.
   ``We expect general mobility would improve and hopefully a
reduction in drug needs,'' Freed said. ``In some marvelous world,
the patient would throw away his crutches. But I think he'd be happy
if he could be where he was 10 years ago.''
   He said the fetal cells ``are exactly like seeds,'' which could
take up to six months to grow, spread and ``re-energize the brain.''
   Implants were done on a few Parkinson's patients in Mexico and
Sweden, but Freed said the results were far from satisfactory. He
said many U.S. ``are primed'' to attempt the procedure, but he
believes he was the first.
   The patient's condition had deteriorated to the point where he
took maximum doses of drugs for little benefit, said Dr. Neil
Rosenberg, a neurologist. The man was unable to work for several
years and asked for the implant.
   University neurosurgeon Robert Breeze, who actually transplanted
the cells Wednesday, said they were implanted with needles through a
hole in the top of the skull to the area deep in the brain where
dopamine acts.
   The two miligrams of tissue implanted were obtained from an
abortion performed by a physician who wasn't involved in the
research. The patient gave her consent, the doctors said.

   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq recessed today
after seven sessions produced no tangible progress toward
consolidating a cease-fire.
   Both sides agreed to resume the negotiations ``in the near
future,'' possibly next month or in January, said U.N. mediator Jan
Eliasson after the final, 50-minute meeting.
   The atmosphere at the latest round of talks, which began Oct. 31,
was described by Eliasson as ``constructive and sober.'' He said the
climate remained chilly and that both sides still refuse to speak to
each other.
   During coffee breaks, there are ``occasions you could detect
something that could ... be called conversation,'' Eliasson added.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said the latest
meetings featured a ``better climate and we do hope that the next
round will achieve practical progress.''
   His Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, also voiced hope for progress
and said Iraq ``will do its best to make the next round fruitful.''
   Eliasson said both countries reaffirmed their commitment to
uphold a cease-fire in effect since Aug. 20 and to implement U.N.
resolution 598, which calls for a comprehensive peace settlement in
the 8-year-old war.
   He gave both sides credit for accepting a Red Cross proposal to
begin exchanging disabled war prisoners Nov. 20.
   But he acknowledged at a news conference that the talks remain
stuck on various points, including the withdrawal of forces to
internationally recognized borders. Iran insists that the withdrawal
be based on a 1975 border treaty that Iraq insists is invalid.

   A man was arrested for underage drinking
after liquor control agents found him getting a 45-minute head start
on celebrating his 21st birthday.
   Michael Luetjen, a University of New Haven junior, was drinking
about 11:15 p.m. Nov. 5 at a restaurant when the agents arrived on a
routine check.
   Luetjen and three others were arrested. When midnight struck, and
Luetjen turned 21 _ Connecticut's drinking age _ he was at police
headquarters.
   ``They all wished me a happy birthday,'' he said.
   After a half-hour stay, Luetjen was released without bail for a
court appearance Nov. 21 on a charge of procuring liquor by a minor.
   ``It's like being in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' he
said. ``I told them, `I'm going to be 21 in a few minutes.' But I
guess 45 minutes is 45 minutes in the eyes of the law.''
   He said he is hoping the judge goes easy on him.

   CBS, which canceled the critically
acclaimed ``Frank's Place,'' drew a scolding from the NAACP as the
organization announced the comedy captured eight nominations in its
Image Awards competition.
   Awards chairwoman Saundra Evers-Manly announced nominees for the
21st annual Image Award on Thursday, and criticized CBS for dropping
the TV show.
   ``We will continue our fight to get the show back on the air,''
she said. ``The show has been treated unfairly, and we will continue
to make sure that the positive images of blacks in that show will
continue to be a part of network programming.''
   The awards, to be presented Dec. 10 in Los Angeles, recognize
positive portrayals of blacks in movies, on television and in music.
They were established 20 years ago by the Beverly Hills-Hollywood
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   In the movie category, ``Cry Freedom,'' about the relationship
between a white journalist and slain South African activist Steve
Biko, received four nominations.
   Three nominations went to the Spike Lee film ``School Daze'' and
the Eddie Murphy comedy ``Coming to America.'' The movies ``Shoot to
Kill,'' with Sidney Poitier, and ``Action Jackson,'' starring Carl
Weathers, received two each.
   Singer Michael Jackson earned two Image nominations.

   ``We would like to have direct talks with the Russians at the
highest level ... to talk about all the issues except one, the
formation of our future government,'' said Burhanuddin Rabbani,
leader of a seven-party guerrilla alliance.
   ``We could talk about other issues, including the war prisoners.
There was a statement by the Russian Embassy in Islamabad that they
have appointed a team to talk to the Mujahedeen (guerrillas)
directly. We have also appointed a team and the talks will start
soon,'' he told reporters Thursday evening.
   In Moscow today, Soviet Foreign Ministry Gennady Gerasimov would
neither confirm nor deny Rabbani's assertion.
   ``We are pursuing every effort'' in an effort to bring the POWs
home, said Gerasimov. ``We are not excluding contacts with
Islamabad,'' he said, referring to the capital of Pakistan, where
Afghan guerrilla political leaders have their headquarters.
   Under the U.N.-mediated Afghanistan accords, signed in April in
Geneva by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet
Union, Moscow began withdrawing its more than 100,000 troops from
Afghanistan on May 15th.
   Half the troops were out by Aug. 15, and the accords call for the
remainer to be removed by Feb. 15.
   However, Moscow recently suspended the withdrawal after
complaining that the United States and Pakistan are still arming the
guerrillas.

   Communist authorities have resurrected the
image of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, the enigmatic revolutionary who
restored Polish statehood 70 years ago and deposed the government
eight years later.
   Once consigned to Stalinist oblivion, Pilsudski is now being
honored by those same authorities who once scorned him as a
reactionary dictator.
   The government also mounted a gala celebration today marking the
anniversary of the birth of the prewar republic. A parliamentarian
had asked that today _ Nov. 11, the main national holiday before
World War II _ be officially restored as a state holiday.
   Today's ceremonies in Warsaw included a rare televised Mass and a
military parade in Victory Square. It represented the most elaborate
celebration ever under communist authorities to mark the 1918
creation of the capitalist, anti-Soviet republic in Poland between
the two world wars.
   Earlier this week, Krakow authorities named a street for
Pilsudski and a Warsaw newspaper launched a drive to set up a museum
for the marshal in the house he owned in Sulejowek, outside the
capital.
   The cult of Pilsudski has never quite died out in Poland. Go into
the home of nearly every supporter of the banned Solidarity trade
union movement and you see on the wall next to the Solidarity emblem
and photographs of Polish-born John Paul II the bushy moustache and
fiery eyes of Pilsudski.
   In recent years the communist party, stressing its role of
guarantor of the nation's existence, has begun to embrace popular
national symbols such as Pilsudski. But historically, Pilsudski is
harder for communists to swallow.
   Although he started out as a socialist, he abandoned most leftist
trappings soon after taking power.
   One of his most-quoted remarks was, ``I rode the red streetcar of
socialism, but got off at the stop called `Independence.'''
   Pilsudski's orientation was anti-Russian. He dreamed of creating
a multinational Central European state that would be large enough to
resist both Soviet and German hegemony.
   One of his first acts was invading the Ukraine, capturing Kiev.
Polish forces eventually were forced to retreat by the Red Army,
which in turn seemed on the verge of crossing Poland and spreading
communism to Germany in 1920.
   But the Poles' brilliant counteraction in mid-August 1920 handed
the Red Army a humiliating defeat, still remembered in Poland as the
``Miracle on the Vistula.''
   Lenin sued for peace, giving up large chunks of previously
Russian territory that remained in Poland's hands until the Soviet
Union took it back at the start of World War II. Pilsudski and
``White Poland'' were deemed ``class enemies.''
   Pilsudski is considered a hero because he united the country and
defended its independence at the end of World War I.
   Poland had been erased from the map of Europe but not from the
minds of Poles during the previous 123 years, having been
partitioned by Prussia, Austria and Russia. World War I and the
Bolshevik Revolution saw the collapse of all three partitioning
powers, allowing Poland to regain independence.
   At the start of World War I, Pilsudski had raised a Polish army
and put it in the service of Austria against Russia. But he was
imprisoned by Austria's ally Germany when he refused to put his
legions under German command.
   When German ranks collapsed in a general panic at the end of the
war, Pilsudski was freed from the castle where he was held.
   After arriving in Warsaw on Nov. 10, 1918, local citizens gave
him the title of commander. He ordered the disarmament of remaining
German troops and declared the Polish Republic restored. Power was
legally transferred to his government Nov. 11 from a Regency Council
set up by the Germans.
   But his reputation lost some luster in 1926 when, impatient with
discord in the elected government, he came out of retirement to
stage a military coup in which 300 people were killed.
   Although nominally out of power, he became Poland's
behind-the-scenes dictator until 1935 when he died and was buried in
Krakow's Wawel Castle alongside Polish kings.
   His senior officers, calling themselves the ``Sanitation''
regime, continued to rule until German and Soviet invasions in 1939
again wiped Poland off the map.
   Postwar Poland saw a new social order, dominated by communists
supported by the Soviet Union. Institutions such as Warsaw
University, which had borne the name of Pilsudski, were renamed.
Nov. 11 was treated as an ordinary work day.
   But 40 years later, the pendulum has swung back, with Pilsudski
restored to the status of national hero.

   A federal judge has ordered the government
to allow federal prison inmates to write newspaper articles for pay.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Legge on Thursday issued a
preliminary injunction barring the government from enforcing
seldom-used rules against such activity and from retaliating against
a inmate who wrote an article critical of a warden.
   Legge said the inmate whose transfer started the case, Dannie
Martin, posed ``no threat to safety or order within the
institution'' by his writing and was punished only for the content
of his articles in the San Francisco Chronicle.
   The judge stopped short of ruling on the legality of regulations
against inmates writing articles under their bylines for pay or
setting up businesses. The injunction is binding until those issues
are decided in a trial.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Sandra Willis said the case was not a
matter of censorship, as the judge implied, and argued the ban on
bylined writing and pay for outside articles was justified by
security considerations.
   ``The money that Mr. Martin was trying to earn caused him to look
for and say things he might not otherwise have said,'' such as
interviewing other prisoners, Willis said. ``You can't control an
inmate who has his own money.''
   But Legge said other prisoners had been allowed to earn money and
that the actions against Martin were based on the content of his
writings.
   Martin's lawyer, Jeffrey Leon, argued that Denny McLain, the
former major league pitcher who served a federal prison term on drug
charges, was allowed to write bylined articles for pay.
   Leon added that the parole board had told Martin his writing was
improving his chances of an early release.
   Martin, joined by the Chronicle, sued federal prison officials
for allegedly transferring him in retaliation for his article
critical the warden at Lompoc prison.
   The suit contends the regulations against inmate articles
violated freedom of expression.
   Martin, 48, began a 33-year sentence for bank robbery in 1981. He
started sending articles to the Chronicle two years ago on his
observations about life at Lompoc.
   In June, he was placed in solitary confinement after the
Chronicle ran his article criticizing the warden. Martin was
transferred twice in the next two weeks.
   The Chronicle asked Legge to return Martin from a prison near
Phoenix to California, where his observations would be of more value
to its readers; the judge asked the lawyers to consult on the issue.

   A retired detective testified that the hands of
an attorney accused of beating to death his adopted daughter were
swollen and scratched, but the witness conceded that photographs did
not back up his claims.
   In testimony Thursday at the murder trial of Joel Steinberg,
former Detective William Lachenmeyer said he used a ``cheap'' camera
to take instant photos of the defendant's hands.
   Defense attorney Ira London challenged Lachenmeyer to find any
``observable scars or scratches or open wounds'' on Steinberg's
hands in the photos.
   The detective replied that the photos ``do not depict how his
hands appeared to me.''
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged in the
death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg in 1987. The illegally adopted
child died after being admitted to a hospital, bruised and comatose.
   Steinberg has denied beating the girl, contending the child fell
unconscious after choking on food. Doctors and nurses from St.
Vincent's Hospital have testified Lisa's legs, arms, back and chest
were covered with bruises.
   Lachenmeyer said he noticed Steinberg's hands were battered just
before he was arrested.
   ``I asked him to put his hands on the table,'' Lachenmeyer said.
``I observed all of his fingers. They were red and swollen. Two
forefingers and two thumbs were scratched.''
   Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's live-in companion, was arrested in
Lisa's death as well, but murder charges were dropped and she is
expected to testify for the prosecution.
   The prosecution contends that she, too, was beaten by Steinberg
and left so incapacitated that she could not act to save Lisa's life.

<TEXT>
   A father convicted of molesting two of
his daughters for half their lives drew a sentence of life plus 20
years in prison from a judge who said he could find nothing
redeeming about the man.
   ``You are the most selfish, self-centered and arrogant person
I've ever met in my 36 years on the bar,'' Superior Court Judge
Bryant Huff told Ed R. Dickey, a 45-year-old Lilburn roofing
contractor, on Thursday.
   ``You don't even have the courage to acknowledge that your two
daughters told the truth on the witness stand in your case.''
   Dickey disregarded the advice of his attorney, Ronnie Batchelor,
and made a 20-minute statement in which he maintained his innocence
and charged anew that his daughters were coerced into testifying by
the state social workers.
   The judge also fined Dickey $10,000 and placed him on 120 years'
probation. Dickey will be eligible for parole in seven years.
   Huff stipulated that if Dickey is paroled, he cannot remain in
the presence of a girl for more than five minutes without the
supervision of an adult.
   Dickey was convicted of child molestation and sodomy Nov. 4 after
a trial in which he largely represented himself. He was accused of
molesting the two oldest of his four daughters, ages 16 and 18,
since they were 8 and 9.
   Dickey's wife, Peggy Sue Dickey, was ejected from the courtroom
during the sentencing hearing when she took the stand as a defense
witness and insisted over the judge's warning on reading a statement
calliang for a mistrial.
   Deidra Dickey, 18, also took the stand Thursday, saying no crime
had been committed because she had forgiven her father.

   Czechoslovak police today broke up a
seminar in Prague, arrested several dissidents and warned 16 foreign
participants that the meeting was illegal, sources in Prague and
Vienna reported.
   Banned playwright Vaclav Havel eluded police who rounded up other
dissidents Thursday and managed to reach the Prague hotel where the
seminar opened today, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Havel managed to declare the seminar open before being arrested
by plainclothes policemen, according to foreign participants in
contact with the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation for
Human Rights.
   Havel was chairman of the committee organizing the seminar. The
gathering was sponsored by the human rights movement Charter 77, the
independent cultural group Jazz Section, an activist group called
the Democratic Initiative and the Czechoslovak-U.S. friendship
society.
   The foreign participants in the seminar protested the police raid
to both the Czechoslovak government and the Helsinki review
conference in Vienna.
   Czechoslovakia's ambassador to that conference, Frantisek
Dolezel, defended the nation's recent tough moves against dissidents
and independent rallies today as actions in accordance with national
legislation, diplomats said.
   Petr Uhl, a dissident who was among 20 people arrested during the
last two days but was released Thursday with a few others, told The
Associated Press by telephone from Prague that foreigners attending
the meeting were told by police that it was ``directed against the
interests of the working class.''
   Nine ambassadors from NATO countries and the charge d'affaires
from several other Western countries later met at the Dutch Embassy
for a briefing from the seminar's foreign participants, said Dick
Knook, the Dutch charge d'affaires.
   Knook, who was reached by telephone from Vienna, suggested that
the Western countries might decide on some joint action in response
to the disruption of the meeting.
   He said Gerald Nagler, executive director of the International
Helsinki Federation, told the diplomats that ``a charming lady with
flowers'' arrived at the hotel where the seminar was and gave the
foreigners notes in envelopes.
   The notes said their further participation at the seminar would
be regarded as ``a manifestation of hostility toward
Czechoslovakia.''
   Some foreign participants also were handed envelopes by
plainclothes policemen warning them the seminar was illegal and not
in the interests of Czechoslovakia, the International Helsinki
Federation office in Vienna said.
   Several dissidents were arrested, sources said.
   A Vienna-based Associated Press reporter who met the two-week
deadline to apply for a journalist's visa to cover the symposium in
Prague was told she could not get a visa to go to Czechoslovakia
until Monday.
   The seminar was to focus on Czechoslovakia's past and future. In
a statement, the 16 foreign participants said the seminar was valid.
   ``We consider the continuation of this seminar about the
significance of the anniversaries of 1918, 1938, 1948 and 1968 for
Czechoslovakia and the whole of Europe to be entirely significant,''
the participants said.
   In 1918, after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Czechoslovakia gained independent nationhood. In 1938, the Nazis
invaded Czechoslovakia's German-speaking area under the Munich
agreement. The communist takeover came in 1948 and in 1968, Warsaw
Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia to crush liberal communist-led
reforms.
   The leader of those reforms, Alexander Dubcek, left
Czechoslovakia today on his first trip abroad in 18 years, a journey
to Bologna, Italy, to receive a university award.

   The government knew about the health
hazards associated with Agent Orange as early as 1962, three years
before the military began spraying the defoliant in Vietnam, a
newspaper reported today.
   Files recently unsealed in U.S. District Court in New York detail
warnings from manufacturers and government agencies dating back to
the early 1960s about the herbicide, The Bridgeport Telegram said.
   Despite contrary medical evidence available at the time, the
Pentagon asserted in May 1963 that 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid
_ the main ingredient in Agent Orange _ presented ``no health hazard
for domestic animals or man,'' the newspaper said.
   Vietnam veterans claim that liver cancers, nervous disorders,
birth defects and numerous other ailments resulted from exposure to
Agent Orange, which was dropped from 1965 to 1971 to deprive enemy
soldiers of food and cover.
   Documents unsealed by U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein
revealed:
   _A former chief staff officer for toxicity review in the Army's
Biological Labs from 1960 to 1970 noted that in 1962 his office was
aware of toxic effects of 2,4,5-T.
   _A $3.5 million test by the National Institutes of Health on
20,000 laboratory animals in 1963 found cases of kidney cysts. Birth
defects in lab animals, including cleft palates, were reported by
the institute in 1968.
   _One Agent Orange manufacturer, T.H. Agriculture & Nutrition Co.,
found that skin and liver damage resulted from exposure to 2,4,5-T,
according to a company document dated Jan. 12, 1965.
   The documents, including videotape testimony from Agent Orange
victims, corporate memos and secret federal documents, were sealed
in 1984 on the eve of a class-action trial on behalf of veterans and
their families who claimed Agent Orange-related illnesses.
   The case was settled out of court later that year when a $180
million trust fund for claimants was established.

<TEXT>
   Forest fires this summer
and fall in Yellowstone National Park killed 254 large animals, a
small fraction of the population, officials said.
   Of the 254 large animals determined to have died, 243 were elk,
four were deer, two moose and five bison, Superintendent Bob Barbee
said Thursday.
   There is no evidence black or grizzly bears in the park were
killed by fire, although a black bear that suffered burns to its
paws was killed Sept. 9 by a Montana State Highway patrolman near
Cooke City, Mont., to the east of the park, Barbee said.
   ``The number of ungulate (moose, bison, deer) deaths caused by
the fires is a very small percentage of total wildlife populations
within the park,'' Barbee said in a statement. ``Yellowstone's elk
population is currently estimated between 30,000 and 35,000 and
bison and deer at 2,700 and 2,000, respectively.''
   Forest fires first were spotted in Yellowstone in late June.
Several fires still are smoldering and one, on the northeastern side
of the park, has yet to be declared under control.
   The mortality survey showed that 213 of the animal carcasses were
found within the perimeter of the North Fork Fire, which was
human-caused, on the west side of the park.
   Most of the animals probably died of smoke inhalation on Sept. 9
when that fire was pushed by 30 mph winds, officials said.
   The carcasses found were left ``in-place'' as extensive
scavenging activity by bears, eagles, ravens and coyotes is
continuing, according to park officials.

<HEAD>Two Victims Buried Nearly A Year After Subway Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two victims of Britain's worst subway fire _ one
unidentified and the other unclaimed _ were buried in the same grave
on Friday, nearly a year after they died.
   The single headstone at St. Pancras Cemetery says they died in
``the terrible fire.''
   The men were buried a day after an official report blamed
management complacency and lax safety measures for the Nov. 18 blaze
that killed 31 people in the King's Cross subway station.
   The fire was found to have been caused by a lighted match dropped
on a wooden escalator.
   Gerald Isaaman, chairman of the King's Cross Disaster Fund, said
the fund's trustees ``decided to bury them on Armistice Day _ a day
of remembrance.'' Armistice Day commemorates the end of World War I.
   ``It is sad to think that two people can die and never be missed
in our community,'' said Canon Douglas Bean, vicar of St. Pancras
Church, who conducted the funeral service. ``It is a reflection of
city life in the age in which we live.''
   One man is still known only as ``115'' _ the registration number
his body was given at the hospital. Police couldn't identify him,
even after checking 5.5 million fingerprints and circulating photos
of an expert reconstruction of his face.
   The other victim was identified as Ralph Humberstone by a former
employer, but no family or friends were traced.
   ``We felt that they ought to receive a proper, decent burial, and
that they should be remembered,'' said Douglas Platts, manager of
the disaster fund. ``We chose a single grave because they were two
lonely souls who died together and therefore we thought it
appropriate they should be buried together.''
   The 13 mourners included the mayor and former mayor of Camden,
the borough which includes King's Cross, members of the trust fund
and Aileen Walker-Smith, director of the King's Cross Support Group
which has been helping families and survivors.
   A 250-page report, based on an inquiry that went on 91 days, was
released Thursday and prompted the resignation of the subways' two
top managers. It blamed executive complacency and an
``uncoordinated, haphazard and untrained'' staff response for the
disaster.

   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson wants
Sweden to have its own No. 10 Downing Street.
   Carlsson, who lives in a rented apartment owned by King Carl
Gustaf, wants to establish an official residence in a 40-room
building tucked between the prime minister's office and the foreign
ministry, which just went up for sale.
   Its last owner, Leo Sager, bequeathed it to the Roman Catholic
Church on condition his wife could stay as long as she lived. She
died in May at the age of 93.
   On Wednesday, his 54th birthday, Carlsson cleared the idea with
the country's political leadership of having a London-style
permanent home for the prime minister.
   The home would cost about $9.8 million, according to the Sager
foundation, which is selling the building for the church. The
address would be Stromgatan 18.
   Carlsson moved into his home near the royal castle, on orders of
the police, who judged his terrace house in Stockholm suburb of
Tyreso too difficult to guard.
   Although convenient, it was seen as improper for the head of
government to rent an apartment from the king, who is head of state.
   If he gets his birthday wish, Carlsson would have 1,380 square
yards to share with his wife, Ingrid, since their two grown
daughters moved away.

   A Soviet doctor who treated victims of
the Chernobyl nuclear accident said radiation appeared to counteract
drugs given to many patients, a newspaper said Friday.
   Svenska Dagbladet quoted Dr. Angelina Guskova as saying 28 of her
150 patients died. They are among the 33 people killed in the 1986
disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident.
   Guskova was quoted as saying 11 of 13 people who received bone
marrow transplants died. She said the radiation apparently was
counteracting drugs designed to prevent the body from rejecting
transplants.
   Surviving patients who visit her Moscow clinic for regular
checkups are suffering severe psychological problems, Guskova said.
   ``They all had to start a new life, find new jobs and apartments.
That, and the psychological hardship that ... remains for them,
demands our attention and sensitivity,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Two teachers have been charged with
possessing leaflets that authorities say urged high school students
to riot, newspapers reported Friday.
   Joseph Andrew Kibagendi and James Ondari Omariba pleaded innocent
to charges of possessing the leaflets.
   The primary school teachers appeared Thursday in magistrate's
court in Nakuru, 95 miles north of Nairobi. The cases were reported
by Nairobi's three English-language newspapers, The Standard, Daily
Nation and the Kenya Times.
   In the past two days, five teachers have been charged with
offenses related to allegedly seditious leaflets.
   Police first revealed the existence of the leaflets Nov. 1 when
they intercepted some mailed to schools in western Kisii and Nyanza
districts, where high school disturbances have taken place recently.
   Students, complaining of lack of teachers, inadequate food and
textbooks, and even too strict discipline, have smashed windows,
broken furniture, beaten up teachers and burned school buildings in
rioting that started in July.

   A power failure delayed flights for up to three
hours Friday at Heathrow Airport, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
   The outage lasted 2{ hours and cut off the air traffic control
switching system, which distributes flight plans in Heathrow and
other British airports, the authority said.
   Eight flights out of Heathrow were canceled, and delays also were
reported at Manchester Airport in northern England and Scotland's
Prestwick Airport near Glasgow, the authority said.
   Air traffic controllers had to distribute flight plans by telex
and telephone during the power failure, said an authority spokesman.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from two typhoons and a
tropical storm that battered the Philippines rose to 670 people
Friday, and officials believed floods and landslides swept away up
to 600 others on one island.
   The Philippine Red Cross said reports Friday from isolated areas
showed that at least 75 people were killed by widespread flooding
and landslides on Palawan Island, 250 miles southwest of Manila.
   Floods and mudslides caused by Tropical Storm Tess swamped
Palawan last weekend, and Typhoon Skip worsened the situation with
more rain early this week, said Lourdes Masing, Red Cross supervisor
for relief.
   Before Tess and Skip, Typhoon Ruby battered most of the country
Oct. 24-25.
   Miss Masing said many areas on Palawan have not been heard from
because of poor communications, and as many as 600 islanders are
believed missing.
   Tito Larrosa, civil defense coordinator on Palawan, said some
landslides and floods hit simultaneously Nov. 4-5.
   In one area, timber piled up at a logging camp crashed down a
mountainside with flood waters and crushed an undetermined number of
houses, a Red Cross report said.
   ``In Rizal, when the water came from the mountains, it was
followed by the mud,'' Larrosa said in a telephone interview from
the Palawan provincial capital of Puerto Princesa.
   ``We heard about the floods on Nov. 6, but it was not only until
yesterday that the reports of the deaths started coming,'' he said.
``We have not heard from the Calamian group,'' a cluster of islands
north of Palawan that is part of the province.
   The mountainous, isolated, jungle-covered island is known as the
Philippines' ``last frontier.''
   Larrosa said among the hardest hit towns was Rizal, where 23
people were confirmed killed by the torrents of mud and water from
the mountains.
   Until the reports from Palawan came in, officials had reported
only 11 deaths from Tropical Storm Tess.
   Officials said 181 people were killed on land when Typhoon Ruby
struck. At least 64 more people drowned when the ferry Dona Marilyn
sank at the height of its fury. Another 200 passengers are missing
and presumed dead.
   The death toll from Typhoon Skip, which hit the central
Philippines Nov. 7, stood at 139 Friday. But officials said they
expected it to rise further as more reports from remote areas came
in.

<HEAD>Rugby Board Split on Contacts with Guerrilla Organization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South African Rugby Board said
Friday it would avoid contact with the outlawed African National
Congress, rebuffing efforts by the board president to end South
Africa's world isolation in the sport.
   The president of the all-white board, Danie Craven, was
criticized for traveling to Zimbabwe last month for meetings with
black African sports officials, including members of the ANC.
   Craven was pursuing plans to form a new rugby union with South
American and other African countries. He announced Friday that those
duties had been passed to another executive member, Johan Claasen.
   Craven said his efforts to unite the board with the
anti-apartheid South African Rugby Union would be handled by
vice-president Fritz Eloff, who had opposed the ANC contacts.
   The board or Craven did not comment on the meaning of the two
decisions, reached during a closed meeting Thursday and announced
Friday. But Craven made it clear he disagreed with the decision on
ANC contacts.
   He told Eloff on Friday, ``I warn you that the only road to
Africa is through the ANC. No matter what you do, you will have to
deal with that.''
   The South Africa government regards the ANC, the main black
guerrilla group fighting to end apartheid, as a terrorist
organization.
   Government officials had demanded that the rugby board explain
its stand on Craven's talks, threatening an end of government aid to
the sport most cherished by the politically dominant Afrikaners.
   Shortly after Craven's meeting, Eloff had discussed with the
International Rugby Board a possible 1989 world team visit to
celebrate South Africa's 100th anniversary of the game.
   Eloff said ANC officials had written to the international board,
urging them not to send a team to South Africa. Eloff said the
letter showed it was naive to believe that negotiating with the ANC
would help South African rugby.
   Most international sports organizations have barred South
Africans from competition to protest the government's policies of
apartheid, under which the black majority has no vote in national
affairs.
   Last year, the International Rugby Board approved a world team
visit to South Africa, but the invited teams or their countries
refused participation.

<HEAD>Fossil Believed To Be That Of World's Oldest Bug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists believe they have discovered the
fossilized remains of the world's oldest bug, a fuzzy, big-eyed
insect resembling a silverfish that lived some 390 million years in
what is now Canada.
   If the dating of the fossil holds up to further examination, the
discovery would push back the origin of insects about 50 million
years, said Michael Greenfield, assistant professor of biology at
the University of California, Los Angeles.
   The fossil was discovered five years ago by Francis M. Hueber of
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, but its importance was
only recently discovered when he and other scientists compared notes.
   The findings were reported in today's issue of the journal
Science in an article by Hueber, Conrad C. Labandeira of the
University of Chicago and Bret S. Beall of the Field Museum of
Natural History in Chicago.
   ``This is the oldest insect in the world,'' Labandeira said in an
interview in today's Los Angeles Times.
   The fossil, found near Quebec, Canada, consists of the head and
two segments of the thorax, or upper chest, of the wingless insect.
The outside of the head was pitted, suggesting the critter had more
than just scales.
   ``This thing had hair,'' Labandeira said.
   The insect, called a bristletail, lived between 390 million and
392 million years ago, he said.
   Its most imposing features were its two disproportionately large
eyes on each side of its head. It also had two antennae and two
armlike appendages that appear to have been equipped with sensors to
detect odors and vibrations.
   A surprising part of the discovery was that the insect appeared
to be about as old as the first land plants, said Labandeira.
   ``I think early terrestrial life did not lag far behind plants,''
he said. ``They came along about the same time or shortly
thereafter.''

<HEAD>Final Vote Count On Minor-Party Candidates Could Take Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis weren't the
only names on many state ballots in the presidential race Tuesday,
but the final vote totals for the minor-party candidates will not be
available for weeks, pending state certification of the tallies.
   Bush received 47.9 million votes to Dukakis' 41 million in the
balloting in unofficial tabulations with more than 99 percent of the
184,660 precincts reporting.
   Those returns come from the principal vote-gathering organization
for the nation, the News Election Service, which tabulated returns
for all states for the two major party candidates on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   NES, owned by ABC, CBS, NBC, The Associated Press and United
Press International, focuses on a speedy, accurate tally of the vote
of major candidates.
   In some states, unofficial tabulations of third-party candidates
such as Libertarian Ron Paul, New Alliance Party standard-bearer
Lenora Fulani, the National Economic Recovery Party's Lyndon
LaRouche and Independent Populist David Duke were made. But such
figures are not available from all states.
   In many cases, the state government does no tabulation of the
vote until a final, official count. This official canvass of county
returns will be completed in some states next week. But some states
will not certify the returns until early January.
   In 1984, third-party candidates were not a significant factor.
   For comparison, final official totals that year showed Ronald
Reagan receiving 54.4 million votes and Walter Mondale 37.5 million.
The next ranking candidate was Libertarian candidate David Bergland
with 228,314, one-quarter of 1 percent of the vote.

   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bruce
G. Sundlun, the apparent loser by a narrow margin in Tuesday's
election, requested a recount today.
   ``Perhaps a mistake was made of some significance,'' said
campaign manager Kenneth Haupt. ``I don't think it's very likely.
Neither does anyone else, really. Still, it should be checked. It
was very close.''
   Republican Edward DiPrete was re-elected by an unofficial margin
of 6,299 votes after Tuesday night's initial machine count, not
including 16,000 still- uncounted absentee ballots and 675 votes
from one late-reporting precinct.
   Haupt said he requested the recount because he owed it to
campaign workers and Sundlun's ``peace of mind.''
   A Sundlun campaign spokeswoman, Eileen Crochiere, said the
campaign is not alleging fraud.
   The governor, who was out of town today, said Wednesday that if
he were in Sundlun's position, he probably would consider asking for
a recount.
   With all but one precinct reporting from Tuesday's election,
DiPrete's unofficial machine total was 195,283 votes, or 51 percent,
to Sundlun's 188,984 votes, or 49 percent. New Shoreham's results
were sent in Thursday.
   A recount would begin Wednesday and probably would take three
days, said Elections Board chairman Joseph DiStefano.
   The recount entails opening all 1,800 voting machines and
comparing the numbers on the meters with those reported on sheets
filled out by precinct workers.
   The last statewide recount was in the 1986 attorney general's
race and did did not change the outcome, DiStefano said.

<HEAD>Soviet Chefs Visit Mississippi Delta Town To Experience Catfish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANOLA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet visitors and their American hosts
wasted little time bringing up the subject of food as they gathered
for a meal at a traditional Southern home in this Mississippi Delta
town.
   The visitors were three chefs who are touring the United States
cooking Soviet delicacies and learning about American foods.
   ``Ketchup,'' Louisiana chef John Folse told the three during
Thursday's meal as he explained what had gone into a bowl of
barbecue sauce. ``It's a very good English word.''
   Folse, who attracted attention in June by serving blackened
catfish to international dignitaries at the Reagan-Gorbachev Summit
in Moscow, said the culinary exchange with the Soviet chefs was
another step in opening relations between the two countries.
   The tour also will include stops in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, New
York, Atlanta and Los Angeles.
   The Soviet chefs toured a catfish farm and the Delta Pride
catfish processing plant in Indianola on Thursday. They had a
Southern dinner featuring barbecue, fried chicken, catfish, potato
salad and Delta wine.
   The meal was at the home of Stan Berry and his wife, Tricia, who
did the cooking. Guests said the visitors assumed the large Southern
mansion was owned by the state, and had trouble understanding it was
owned by a family.
   Translator Galvina Birjukava said she could appreciate the warmth
of the Southern greeting. ``Russians are known for their
hospitality,'' she said.
   Chef Natalia Tokareva, speaking through a translator, said that
while she was not sure if Mississippi catfish would ever be
availiable in Moscow, her country may learn much from the Delta
industry.
   ``It would be very popular,'' Tokareva said. ``It is quite
possible to raise such catfish in the Soviet Union.''
   False said that during their 12-day tour the chefs would learn
how to cook such things as catfish and crawfish, as well as teach
American chefs about their foods.
   The visit by Soviet chefs is in direct response to Folse's summit
restaurant, said Sam Hinote, president of Delta Pride.

   A Soviet dancer whose wife and daughter
were refused permission to join him in the West for nearly 12 years
was reunited with them in a joyous meeting at Jackson's Municipal
Airport.
   Fridrikh Begelmakher, 37, hugged his 36-year-old wife, Irina, and
the daughter he had last known as an infant and spoke softly to them
in Russian at their reunion Thursday. Begelmakher handed his wife
red roses and a love poem and gave their daughter, Olga, 13, some
daisies.
   ``What is going to be special is that we will be together. That
is what is special,'' said Begelmakher, a Jew who emigrated from the
Soviet Union during the exodus of the late 1970s.
   The family had seen each other only once since Begelmakher left
the Soviet Union with his parents on Feb. 21, 1977. He had expected
his wife and daughter to quickly follow, but they were repeatedly
denied permission to leave until this summer.
   ``The miracle we are witnessing today is something we worked hard
for for a long time. My wife kept applying to leave but was given
unreasonable excuses,'' said Begelmakher, who is chairman of dance
for Jackson Public Schools' Academic and Performance Arts Complex.
   He greeted his wife wearing the black shirt he wore the last time
he danced a ballet with her in the Soviet Union. The shirt is the
last piece of clothing remaining that he took from his homeland.
   Begelmakher said he had penned the poem early Thursday morning.
It read in part: ``I want to learn to talk _ to tell how much I love
you. But most of all I want to learn to love _ to love you.''
   Begelmakher had to divorce his wife, who is not Jewish, in order
to leave the Soviet Union, and the couple plans to remarry here, he
said.
   On July 24, the mother and daughter left the Soviet Union for
Vienna, where they waited for permission to enter the United States.
Begelmakher met them there Aug. 8.On Tuesday, they arrived in New
York, where they stayed with Begelmakher's parents.
   Since he came to the United States, Begelmakher has taught ballet
in many places, including Pennsylvania, Utah, Massachusetts,
Vermont, Idaho, Nebraska and New York. In September, he began
teaching ballet to students in the Jackson Public School system and
leading a four-member dance faculty.

   ABC President James Duffy pledged his
network's continued support for efforts to fight illiteracy, telling
a meeting here that the United States has the worst illiteracy rate
of any industrialized nation.
   Duffy noted that ABC and Public Broadcasting Service launched a
program last year to call attention to the problem. Television
programs, public service announcements and other broadcasts have
generated hundreds of thousands of calls to a national hot line, he
said Thursday at the Governor's Third Annual Statewide Literacy
Conference.
   Late next spring, ABC plans another program on literacy, he said,
and part of that will include live broadcasts from ``town meetings''
to determine how selected communities are dealing with the problem
of illiteracy.
   Also Thursday, television evangelist Pat Robertson pledged $1
million to fight illiteracy in Mississippi.
   Robertson, chairman of the board of Christian Broadcasting
Network and the host of ``The 700 Club,'' told a news conference
he'll also lead efforts to raise another $5 million from private
donations to help teach reading and writing to adults and youths.
   Robertson, speaking at the Voice of Calvary Ministries in
Jackson, said his program would establish a statewide network of
educators and volunteers to move Mississippi into the top 10
literacy rankings over the next 10 years.
   Duffy told the meeting of educators, state officials and business
leaders: ``The fact is that illiteracy cannot be identified with any
one state or region or ethic group or in any one socio-economic
group. It is everywhere in the country.
   ``There are 23 million Americans who cannot read or write at the
fourth-grade level. There are 35 to 36 million who cannot read or
write at the eighth-grade level.
   ``The question is whether the leadership is aware of the problems
... fully aware of the fundamental significance of what it means in
this country,'' Duffy said.
   ``We do have the worst illiteracy rate of any industrialized
nation in the world. Thirteen to 15 percent of the national
workforce is functionally illiterate.
   ``We have a human resource problem in this country that threatens
our competitive position in the world. This is the economic
imperative behind the rapidly growing literacy movement in this
country,'' the ABC president said.

   President Reagan, in his last official
appearance at a Veterans Day ceremony, delivered an emotional
message of gratitude to the ``gentle heroes'' of Vietnam, saying
young Americans should ``never be sent again to fight and die unless
we are prepared to let them win.''
   Accompanied by his wife, Nancy, Reagan walked along the granite
Vietnam Veterans Memorial, paying tribute to the more than 58,000
war dead, and said, ``In our hearts you will always be young.''
   A crowd of several thousand people gathered on the green lawn of
the mall facing the memorial, including several men wearing military
jackets, some in wheelchairs, who heckled Reagan during his speech.
What they said was inaudible to bystanders; the president took no
note of the heckling.
   It was Reagan's second visit to the memorial. He first visited
the site on Veterans Day 1984 to dedicate the statue of three
soldiers.
   Before he started his speech today, Reagan was presented with a
miniature replica of the statue by John Wheeler, the head of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund.
   In his speech, Reagan said the U.S. government was doing
everything possible to learn whether Americans are still being held
against their will in Southeast Asia. He said that unless the Hanoi
government can assure America that this isn't so, ``we will assume
they are and will do everything we can to get them home.''
   Dan Reed of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, who described himself as a
Vietnam veteran, said veterans appreciated the ceremony, but didn't
think the government was doing enough to bring home any remaining
prisoners of war. ``If you can't bring us home, don't send us. We
don't want any White House jive,'' he told a reporter.
   Reagan said that when he visited the site four years ago he
voiced the hope that a process of healing had begun and said, ``It
appears to me that we have healing.''
   The president, noting that he will soon leave office, said ``what
I can say to our Vietnam vets is `welcome home'.'' Reagan also said
that despite the divisions in America over the Vietnam conflict,
``who can doubt that the cause for which our men fought was just?''
   He said the Vietnam war was a just cause, ``however imperfectly
pursued.''
   Reagan said a major lesson of the Vietnam war is that ``young
Americans never be sent again to fight and die unless we are
prepared to let them win.''
   Earlier, Reagan spoke to a huge crowd gathered in the
amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac River
in Virginia.
   He said Americans traditionally remember their war dead by laying
wreaths, attending memorial ceremonies and speaking ``words of
truth.'' But, he said, in honoring the dead everyone must recognize
that ``they can never be fully ours again _ that they belong to
God.''
   Reagan arrived in late morning to a 21-gun salute. As his
motorcade approached the amphitheater, several thousand men and
women, many wearing their military uniforms, stood holding flags
under a brilliant sun and in the midst of the rich colors of autumn
foliage.
   Reagan went immediately to the Tomb of the Unknowns for the
traditional presentation of a wreath.
   In his brief amphitheater speech, Reagan called it the highest
act of patriotism ``to lay down one's life so that others can live.''
   And he said one can imagine that as life expired for a victim of
war, ``those who could had last thoughts of us and of their loved
ones.''
   Meanwhile, President-elect George Bush, in a statement issued
from Florida, where he is vacationing, said this is a special
Veterans Day because it is the first since Reagan signed into law
the bill creating the Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs.
   ``This is a distinction that America's veterans have earned and
richly deserve,'' he said. ``It guarantees that those who have worn
the uniform of our armed forces will always have a strong voice in
our government. I urge all Americans to join President Reagan and me
in celebrating Veterans Day as a way to honor the true patriots of
our great nation.''

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the
Kristallnacht 50th anniversary speech by West German Parliament
President Philipp Jenninger. The 26-page speech was translated into
English by The Associated Press.
   The Jews in Germany and all the world today remember the events
of 50 years ago. Also we Germans remember what happened in our
country a half century ago, and it is good that we do this in both
states on German soil. Because our history cannot be divided into
good and bad, and the responsibility for the past cannot be divided
according to the arbitrary geographic postwar order.
   
   What happended 50 years ago today right here in Germany, had not
occurred since the Middle Ages in any civilized country. And, even
worse: the rioting did not come from the expression of a motivated,
spontaneous public rage, but an action thought up, supported and
called for by state leadership.
   
   The ruling party in the form of its highest representatives,
suspended rights and laws. The state itself became the organizer of
crimes. Instead of purposeful laws and ordinances, with whose help
the insidious deprivation of Jews was carried out for years, public
terror took over. A minority of several hundred thousand were
declared fair game, their possessions and property left to the
destructive rage of an organized mob.
   
   Far more than 200 synagogues were burned down or demolished,
Jewish cemeteries were ravaged, thousands of businesses and homes
damaged and plundered. About 100 Jews found their death, about
30,000 were dragged to concentration camps; many of them never
returned. What cannot be described in numbers is the torment,
oppression, humiliation, mishandling, and degradation.
   
   (Nazi propagandist Joseph) Goebbels, the director of the entire
action, in some ways made a mistake in his calculations, when no one
_ domestic or foreign _ believed in the fiction of `spontaneous
public hate.' That was seen to by the inactivity of police and
firemen who stood around and let the synagogues burn, and only acted
when Aryan property was endangered.
   
   Later, party court proceedings verified with cynical openness
that the uniformed SA troops (the storm troopers) and the other
arsonists and murderers only carried out the will of the leadership.
In the end, only those who had made themselves guilty of sexual
relations with a non-Ayran were punished.
   
   The public for the most part remained passive; that was the
attitude in regard to anti-Jewish actions and measures in the
following years. Only a few joined in the rioting _ but there was no
rejection, no resistance worthy of mentioning. Reports speak of
consternation and shame, of pity, yes even disgust and horror. But
only a very few were sympathetic, gave practical solidarity,
assistance or help. All saw what happened, but the majority of them
looked away and said nothing. Also the churches were silent.
   The term Reichskristallnacht is today rightly seen as
inappropriate. But it described appropriately the mood and feelings
then: a mixture of embarassment, irony and playing down. Above all
it was the expression of painfully being moved and of ambivalance of
one's own feelings faced with open responsibility of the party and
state leadership.
   
   For the fate of the Germans and European Jews, Hitler's successes
were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and misdeeds. The
years from 1933 to 1938, even from a distant retrospective and in
the knowledge of what followed, still are a fascinating thing today,
since throughout history there was hardly a parallel to Hitler's
triumphal procession during the first years.
   A reattaching of the Saarland, implementation of common military
duty, massive arming, conclusion of the German-British fleet
agreement, occupation of the Rhineland, the Olympic Summer Games in
Berlin, the annexation of Austria, and the Great German Reich, and
finally, just a few weeks before the November pogrom the Munich
Agreement, the dividing up of Czechoslovakia _ the Versailles treaty
was really only a scrap of paper, and the German Reich at once was
the hegemonial power on the old continent.
   For the Germans who overwhelmingly had felt the Weimar Republic
as the consquence of foreign, political humiliation, this all must
have appeared to be a miracle. And not only that, from massive
unemployment came full employment, from massive misery came a type
of prosperity for most levels. Instead of desperation and
hopelessness there was optimism and self-confidence.
   Didn't Hitler bring to reality what Wilhelm II had only promised,
that is to lead the Germans to glorious times? Wasn't he chosen by
Providence, a Fuehrer such as is given to a people only once in a
thousand years? Certainly in free elections Hitler had never gotten
a majority of the Germans behind him. But who wanted to doubt that
in 1938 a large majority of the Germans stood behind him, identified
with him and his policies? Certainly, there were some malcontent
grumblers who wanted no peace and quiet and were persecuted by the
SD (the Nazi security service) and the Gestapo. But most Germans _
and in fact from all levels, from bourgeoisie as well as from the
working class _ could be convinced in 1938 that they were to be
seeing in Hitler the greatest statesman of our history.
   And still something else cannot be overlooked. All of the
astounding successes were collectively and individually an
additional slap in the face for the Weimar system.
   And Weimar was not only synonymous with foreign policy weakness,
party quarrelling, and change of government, with economic misery,
with chaos, street fights and political confusion in a broad sense,
it was also a synonym for parliamentary democracy, for checks and
balances and citizens rights, for freedom of the press and freedom
to assemble, and finally for a maximum amount of Jewish assimilation
and emancipation.
   That means Hitler's successes discredited additionally above all
the parliamentarily established system of freedom, the democracy of
the Weimar itself. For many Germans there wasn't even the question
of which system to prefer. People enjoyed perhaps in some walks of
life fewer individual freedoms. But it was better for individuals
than previously. The Reich was undoubtedly great, yes greater and
more powerful than before. Hadn't the leaders of Great Britain,
France and Italy visited Hitler just then in Munich and aided him to
another one of these successes that hadn't been believed possible?
   And as far as the Jews were concerned, hadn't they claimed for
themselves in the past a role that wasn't right for them? Hadn't
they deserved being put back in their place? And above all, didn't
the propaganda _ apart from the wild exaggeration not to be taken
seriously _ correspond in essential points to their own conjectures
and convictions?
   And when it got so bad, as it was in November 1938, people could
still say, using the words of a contemporary _ what's it to us, look
away if it terrifies you. It is not our fate.
   Many Germans let themselves be blinded and seduced by the Nazis.
Many through their indifference made the crimes possible. Many
became criminals. Everyone must answer for himself the question of
guilt and its suppression.
   But what we must all be united against is the raising of
questions about historical truths, the miscalculation of the
victims, the renunciation of facts. Whoever wants to charge guilt,
whoever says that everything wasn't so _ or not completely so bad,
he is making an attempt to defend where there is no defense.

   The National Mediation Board intervened in the
labor dispute between Northwest Airlines and its 4,800 pilots,
averting the possibility of a strike at midnight tonight.
   The board stepped in at the request of Northwest Chairman Steven
Rothmeier.
   Members of the Air Line Pilots Association voted overwhelmingly
Monday through Thursday to set a midnight strike deadline. But a
walkout is illegal under mediation, and the union will not strike,
said spokesman Tim Barzen.
   Contract talks between the carrier and pilots reached an impasse
Nov. 1 over wages, work rules and fringe benefits. Union spokesman
Pete Quortrup said negotiators disagree on more than 100 issues.
   With 85 percent of the union's pilots voting this week, nearly 97
percent said they would support a strike, union spokesman Andy
Murphy said today.
   Under mediation, wages and work rules remain unchanged. Mediators
handle negotiations until there is a settlement or an impasse, at
which point the board will offer arbitration.
   If either side rejects the offer, there would be a 30-day cooling
off period before Northwest could impose a contract or the union
could strike.
   ``We intend to schedule mediation sessions at an early date. As
soon as we get someone available,'' said Charles Barnes, executive
director of the National Mediation Board in Washington.
   Redmond Tyler, a Northwest spokesman, said the threat of a strike
did not appear to affect ticketing for flights over the weekend.
   Pilots are flying under two contracts _ one covering 2,000 pilots
who flew for Republic Airlines before its 1986 merger with
Northwest, the other covering 2,800 pilots who flew for Northwest or
have been hired since the merger.

   In a $9.25-a-day parking lot under an elevated
downtown highway, urban archaeologist Ricardo Elia is searching for
17th-century Boston.
   Elia and a team of Boston University archaeologists are using
trowels and brooms to probe repositories of urban detritus before
construction workers using dynamite reclaim the land forever to move
the Central Artery underground.
   ``You just couldn't conceive of someone getting a research grant
to rip up a parking lot under the artery and see what's there,''
Elia, who heads a 10-person BU archaeology team staying several
steps ahead of construction, said as traffic rumbled overhead
Thursday.
   After about a month of digging, the archaeologists have unearthed
the soggy timbers of a wharf that a John Eustis bought in 1709 on
property abutting what was then Boston's waterfront.
   The $846,000 federal- and state-funded project to search for
Colonial Boston is part of a gradual movement to recognize the
significance of what lies buried under America's cities.
   While maps, deeds, bills of sale and other historical documents
have been preserved, the physical remains of early America are
scarce, archaeologists said.
   Urban or historical archaeology is only as old as the National
Historical Preservation Act of 1966. Since then, New York,
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Alexandria, Va., Charleston, S.C., and
Savannah, Ga., all have let archaeologists examine land before
development.
   ``What we are getting nationwide are little snapshots on what
happened in the past in the centers of cities,'' said Ron Anzalone,
staff archaeologist for the federal Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation in Washington.
   ``We learn an awful lot about how Boston developed, about how
everyday life occurred, that you just can't get from tax records,''
he said. ``In many communities there would be no other way to know
about the early history and how it relates to the development of the
United States.''
   The university team has moved from Eustis' land a quarter mile to
the other shore of old Boston, digging under the asphalt on the site
of a 19th century mattress company warehouse and below that the 17th
century estate of John Codman.
   ``So much of Boston has been dug up that you've lost much of the
archaeological history already,'' Elia said. ``The 17th and 18th
centuries are just not very visible today.''
   Boston prides itself on history, yet very little remains of
Colonial Boston. In fact, the Paul Revere House in the North End is
the only 17th-century house standing, and it has been heavily
restored.
   One reason is that 1630 Boston was much smaller than 1988 Boston,
much of which consists of landfill upon which the city gradually
expanded. Another is that many of the city's old buildings burned
down.
   Elia said the planned excavation of 10 sites along the Boston
highway could indicate how houses were designed and built, what
people ate and how commerce occurred.
   Preliminary digging about one foot deep into a 40-by-20-feet
L-shaped site on the Blackstone Allright parking lot has revealed a
stone foundation of the three-story mattress warehouse. An elixir
bottle half-filled with a yellow liquid turned up Thursday.
   The deeper archaeologists go, the more artifacts they will find
on the site, which housed stables, outhouses and a variety of
buildings.
   So far, they have found shards of Wedgewood pots, a wide-bore
stem pipe, a layer of manure from a stable and other urban artifacts.
   The archaeologists used computer generated overlays of a 1630
outline of the Shawmut peninsula, modern maps and utility charts to
determine potential excavation sites along the multibillion-dollar
Central Artery project, scheduled to be completed in 1998.
   Three of the 10 sites have been excavated and the others should
be completed by mid-December. Archaeologists will spend the winter
analyzing timber samples and other artifacts before deciding whether
a more thorough digging is needed.
   Whatever they find, much more will remain hidden.
   ``You're digging in a city that has continued to build upon
itself since the beginning,'' said graduate student David Landon, a
staff archaeologist of the project.

   A top PLO official said Friday a
declaration of independence for the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be
a key legal move toward transforming the Israeli-occupied
territories into Palestine.
   ``From the international, legal point of view, this will
consecrate officially the identity of the West Bank and Gaza,'' said
Bassam Abu Sharif on the eve of a Palestine National Council
meeting. The council is expected to approve an independence
declaration.
   Abu Sharif, chief spokesman for PLO leader Yasser Arafat, met
with reporters at the heavily guarded seaside center where the PLO's
parliament-in-exile begins a four-day meeting Saturday.
   Abu Sharif also claimed there were Israeli plans to assassinate
top PLO leaders. He said a list of intended victims included Arafat
and that one assassination was recently attempted. He would not say
when or where it occurred.
   In Jerusalem, Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, responded: ``The ... imagination of Bassam Abu Sharif has
apparently been working overtime in anticipation of the PNC and he
will say anything to get a headline.''
   The meeting of the 450-member council is seen as a historic
moment in Palestinian history and comes during an 11-month uprising
against Israel's 21-year occupation of the territories.
   More than 300 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died since the
uprising began Dec. 8 in the territories Israel seized from Egypt
and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Israeli officials say an independence declaration will hurt the
peace process and incite more anti-Israeli violence in the
territories.
   ``The declaration is irrelevant,'' said a Shamir aide, Yossi Ben
Aharon. ``But to our sorrow, it will incite the population.''
   Abu Sharif told reporters: ``Palestinians have a right to a
state, all other details can be negotiated.''
   ``This PNC will legislate beyond doubt the line that has been
presented by Chairman Arafat for a long time _ calling for a just
peace in the Middle East and confirming our readiness to sit down
and negotiate at an international conference,'' Abu Sharif said.
   Abu Sharif said the next step after the declaration is
recognition of the state from other nations.
   The Palestinian meeting comes after Jordan severed its links with
the West Bank last summer and after Israeli national elections Nov.
1 that produced gains by the right, which rejects giving up any of
the occupied territories.
   In Jordan, where 1.5 million of the world's 5 million
Palestinians live, several refugees doubted their
parliament-in-exile will achieve a decisive breakthrough for a
homeland in the meetings.
   ``The PNC will talk endlessly as usual,'' said Ibrahim Abu Kheit,
87, who owns a coffee shop in the Baqaa camp north of Amman,
Jordan's capital.
   Support for the PNC meeting came from 17-year-old Ziad Naimeh.
   ``It is for our benefit, if they have positive results,'' he
said. But ``I would not go back to live with an Israeli neighbor
even if my dad insists on returning,'' said Naimeh, whose family
fled Haifa, in what is now Israel, in the 1947-48 war.

   Mary and Gerald Peters wanted all of
their six children to have a part in naming the latest addition to
the family.
   The result: Eric Michael David Stephen Joshua Kevin Carl Quentin
Jesse Alexander William Peters.
   ``It was a little unique to me, but I have six other kids, and
each one of them wanted to give him a name,'' said Gerald Peters,
who has given three of the children multiple middle names.
   The parents picked Eric, Kevin, Carl and William, and the
siblings filled in the gaps for the baby, born Oct. 26.
   Gerald Peters began the tradition of multiple middle names,
belatedly and with his wife's approval, because he dislikes his
first name and wanted his children to have choices. He does,
however, like his middle name so much that all the boys have a
``William'' in their name.
   ``The children who don't have multiple middle names ask why,'' he
said. ``They think it's cool. They say, `Dad, how come you didn't
give us more names?'''
   Gerald William Jr., 12, contributed the name Stephen; Lucinda
Louise, 11, submitted David and Joshua; Terrence (but please call
him Terry) William, 7, recommended Michael; Nathanael (Fred)
Frederick William, 6, suggested Alexander.
   ``Matthew Lawrence William, 3, gave us Jesse, the only name he
could say,'' Peters said. ``Michelle Heather Sandra Louise Peters,
1{, is just a baby so we gave her Quentin. We figured this way, when
she got older, she wouldn't argue with us that she didn't get to
name him, too.''
   The rest of the baby's names came from his parents' desire for a
nice round number of middle names _ 10.
   But what do they call him for short?

   It was a pop quiz that even the teacher flunked.
   With more than 200 lawyers, jurors and other people crammed into
his King County Superior courtroom for the start of Washington's
Centennial celebration Thursday, Judge Gerard Shellan asked whether
anyone knew who was president of the United States when the state
joined the Union on Nov. 11, 1889.
   No one answered.
   ``It was Grover Cleveland,'' Shellan said. ``He was the president
of the United States who approved the admission of the state of
Washington into the Union.''
   Wrong. It was Benjamin Harrison, who took over from Cleveland
earlier in 1889 after beating him in the 1888 election.
   Shellan acknowledged his mistake later.
   ``I looked it up after bringing it up in court,'' Shellan said.
``I obviously should have looked it up first.''

   A TV anchorwoman was fired after writing
in a Christian magazine that she pursued some stories and quashed
others on religious grounds.
   ``God needs servants who can influence the content of our news,''
KDLT anchorwoman Marilee Joyce wrote in Good News, published by a
local Christian cable TV station.
   Steven Herman, KDLT president and general manager, on Thursday
said Joyce was fired for ``an error in journalistic judgment''
reflected in the article.
   Joyce, 25, who has worked as an anchor, reporter and producer at
the NBC affiliate since April, said said she was devastated at being
fired Tuesday. ``I am a news professional and I conducted myself in
that manner,'' she said.
   In the article, ``A Different Type of TV Evangelism,'' Joyce
explained how she viewed her role as a Christian in the secular news
media.
   ``Naturally, I have to lead with the hard news stories that
affect our neighborhood and world ... but it's such a thrill to also
have the power to `sneak' Jesus into the news as often as
possible,'' she wrote.
   She said that on numerous occasions she had used her position to
prevent broadcast of network stories that she said were of
``questionable nature,'' including series on the New Age movement
and on the Hare Krishna religion.
   ``I decided it would not be good to fill our viewers' minds with
such information, so I didn't permit the stories to air,'' Joyce
wrote.
   Joyce also described how she assigned several stories with
religious angles, including an interview with a Christian author and
a story on an anti-abortion agency.

   A federal judge ruled that adoptive parents have no
constitutional right to records detailing abuses suffered by their
children before adoption.
   U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders also ruled Thursday that the
Texas Department of Human Services does not have to help pay for
psychiatric care needed later by children who were abused before
being adopted.
   The rulings were in connection with a lawsuit filed in May by six
sets of adoptive parents from the Dallas area.
   The parents charged that the state failed to disclose their
children's histories of abuse. One family said it learned of its
13-year-old adoptive son's sexual and physical abuse only after he
threatened to kill family members.
   The families had asked the court to compel the state to release
background information on their adopted children and provide
financial assistance of up to $20,000 a year in some cases.
   State officials maintain they provide parents with all essential
information about children with special needs before adoptions
become final.

   An entrepreneur in the third week of a hunger
strike to draw attention and maybe a few investors to his failing
business says his spirits were raised by a visit from real estate
tycoon Donald Trump.
   ``It was nice that the big guy came down to visit the little
guy,'' Jan Stuart, 34, said after Trump visited him for about 20
minutes Thursday in the illegally parked van he lives in opposite
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Cliffside Park, N.J., resident began the unusual stunt Oct.
24 after turning a $2,000 investment into a multimillion-dollar
business, only to see it fail when several key investors went out of
business.
   Trump told Stuart he will try to get the owners of some major
companies and stores to consider helping the Jan Stuart Skin Care
Co., which for eight years has produced natural ingredient men's
shaving and skin care products.
   ``Maybe they'd be interested,'' Trump told Stuart.
   Stuart said Trump told him that ``a guy willing to risk his
health needs to be heard by the right people.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Post-War Problems From Vietnam Combat, Herbicide
Exposure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Legion survey, contradicting
government findings, says that Vietnam-era veterans who were exposed
to heavy combat or the herbicide Agent Orange suffered more post-war
health and emotional problems than those who weren't.
   The Legion's report, released Friday and based solely on
questionnaires returned by veterans themselves, is at odds with the
medical studies of the Centers for Disease Control and the Veterans
Administration. They found no significant health differences among
veterans of the Vietnam era, regardless of whether they actually
served in Southeast Asia.
   Questionnaires were completed by 6,810 American Legion members in
six states.
   ``Men who faced high levels of combat intensity are at greater
risk for divorce and for generally being less happy and satisfied
with their lives, their marriages, their role as fathers, and as
sexual human beings,'' the Legion's report said.
   ``Although in this population they have reached comparatively
high levels of education, they earn significantly less money than
peers of their same age and educational attainment,'' it said.
   In a section on Agent Orange, the Legion study said there were
``significant dose-related relationships between exposure to
herbicides and subsequent development of skin conditions such as
rash with blisters and change in skin color.''
   The study also connected Agent Orange exposure to benign fatty
tumors and ``a dose-related risk for miscarriage among wives of
Agent Orange-exposed veterans.''
   Agent Orange, named for the color of containers used to transport
and store the chemical, was a powerful mixture of two types of
herbicides. It was sprayed in Vietnam from 1962 to 1971 to kill
vegetation, such as dense jungle, that provided cover and protection
for Viet Cong soldiers and their supply routes.
   The spraying stopped after laboratory studies showed that dioxin,
one of the Agent Orange ingrediants, caused cancer in laboratory
animals.
   Since the end of the Vietnam war, there have been a number of
studies both supporting and contradicting the contention that Agent
Orange caused ill health among Vietnam veterans.
   In July, the CDC reported that a physical examination of
thousands of Vietnam veterans showed ``the perceived exposure to
herbicides is associated both with psychological problems and with
self-reported adverse health conditions, but is not associated with
objective measures of exposure.''
   Also in July, the VA reported that based on the physical
examination of 220,000 Vietnam veterans there were no ``unusual
health patterns.''
   The American Legion survey was conducted over a five-year period
by Steven D. Stellman of the New York City Department of Health, and
Jeanne Mager Stellman of Columbia University. It was published
Friday in the scientific journal Environmental Research.
   Of the veterans interviewed for the study, 42 percent, or 2,858,
served in Southeast Asia. About 20 percent of that group fell into
the ``high combat'' category, meaning they were frequently exposed
to fire.
   Among the study's findings:
   _Family income was $2,470 less for high combat veterans than for
men of the same age and educational background.
   _High combat veterans were four times more likely to have a
divorce or marital separation than veterans who did not serve in
Southeast Asia.
   _There is a greater tendency to smoke or drink heavily, and twice
the tendency to take tranquilizers or sleeping pills, among high
combat veterans. Self-reporting of illicit drug use, however, was
low.
   _The rate of post-traumatic stress disorder ranged from 1.8 to 15
percent, depending on the level of combat experienced. PTSD is the
tendency to experience emotional reactions to life-threatening
stress situations long after the situations have passed. The study
said that in some cases the symptoms persisted for as long as 20
years.
   _Combat was related to the self-reported incidence of high blood
pressure, ulcers and various types of disease.

   Dan Rather, then a young bureau chief for CBS
News, recalled Friday the rush of emotion when he was one of the
first outsiders to see a dramatic home movie of the Kennedy
assassination.
   ``I was up and wanted to take the hinges off the door to tell
somebody what I'd seen. I blew out of that office and ran down the
stairs. I didn't wait for the elevator, and I went back to the
station,'' the CBS-TV anchorman recalled at a news conference to
discuss CBS News' Nov. 17 documentary marking the 25th anniversary
of the John F. Kennedy assassination.
   Rather learned shortly after the Nov. 22, 1963, shooting that
Abraham Zapruder had it on film. Rather contacted the family, but
they already had a lawyer.
   The newsman said the only other person who showed up at the
attorney's office two days after the assassination to try to buy
rights to the film was from Life magazine.
   The attorney, Rather recalled, ``said we're going to show it to
you once, no notes, then it's going up for bids.''
   Rather said network executives authorized him to offer up to
$10,000. When he got back to the attorney, Rather said, the film had
been sold.
   ``I grabbed him by the lapels and said, `What do you mean, it's
been sold?''' Life had paid $150,000.
   Rather also recalled that Don Hewitt, now executive producer of
``60 Minutes,'' had suggested, ``grab the film, just grab it and run
back to the studio and we'll put it on the air and let them sue ...''

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and his
actress-wife Robin Givens failed to reach a divorce agreement in a
Las Vegas meeting, but a split of the couple's finances should be
finalized this month, her lawyer said Friday.
   The Tyson-Givens get-together Saturday prior to the Sugar Ray
Leonard-Donny Lalonde fight was the last meeting the couple will
have before the divorce goes through, said attorney Raoul Lionel
Felder.
   ``The next step now is the figures, which the lawyers will go
over. It should be finished in a week to 10 days,'' he said.
   The attorney denied a report that Givens asked the undefeated
heavyweight for a reconciliation. They married in February, and
Givens filed for divorce after eight months.
   Givens will keep her pledge not to ask for any of Tyson's money,
said Felder, who blamed the settlement delay on problems in figuring
out how much in joint accounts belonged to each.

   Several hundred people turned out to
welcome country comedian Jerry Clower to his home town for a
ceremony that was put off for 16 years.
   ``When I look out and see the faces of these people, I know I'm
home,'' Clower said. ``It all started here _ and when they place me
in the East Fork Cemetery and I go home to glory, it'll all end
here.''
   Thursday's activities, which included a chicken dinner on the
grounds and a special Clower performance at Southwest Mississippi
Community College, was in sharp contrast to a derailed homecoming
for Clower 16 years ago.
   In 1972, a similar gala was canceled for fear Clower's support
for public schools would threaten fund-raising efforts for a
racially segregated private academy.
   ``That's all water under the bridge now,'' said Clower, who
recently moved back to Liberty after 34 years in Yazoo City.
   ``Those days are over with, thank God,'' said Clower, who has
been honored as the top country comic for nine consecutive years.
Both black and white residents attended Thursday's celebration.

   Comedian Dennis Miller, who says West
Virginia is so backward it ``makes Mayberry look like a
think-tank,'' says his jokes about the state aren't personal.
   ``I went to see Burt Reynolds' film `Cannonball Run 2' in West
Virginia. At the end of the movie, everybody broke up into
individual discussion groups,'' Miller says on his new album, ``The
Off-White Album.''
   The Pittsburgh native, a performer on ``Saturday Night Live,''
said he didn't intend to upset West Virginians.
   ``It's not as deep or as vindictive as people would tend to
think,'' Miller said this week. ``I had a line about `Mayberry
think-tank'' and I thought, `Hey, West Virginia, why not?' referring
to the television show about backwoods life.
   Miller said he made frequent trips to West Virginia as a youth.

   Actor Kurt Russell says there's only one movie he
ever wanted to make about baseball, his former career.
   It was ``Bull Durham,'' and someone else got the leading role.
   ``I agreed to do the movie and left town. When I came back, I
found out Kevin Costner had been cast,'' Russell said in the
December issue of Mademoiselle magazine.
   ``I wrote him telling him how good I thought he was,'' said
Russell, 37. ``But there were real pangs. I'll never have a chance
to do a picture like that again. That was my life on the screen.''
   Russell played minor league ball until he was 22. At age 9,
Russell successfully auditioned for a role in the movie, ``Safe at
Home'' so he could meet Mickey Mantle.
   ``If you've lived the life of a player ... then everything else
in life is very tame. That's why I like the reckless abandon of
acting,'' he said.

Company</HEAD>

   An animal rights activist was arrested
today on charges she planted a pipe bomb in an attempt to kill the
chairman of a surgical equipment company that experiments on dogs,
police said.
   Police said 33-year-old Fran Stephanie Trutt of New Hyde Park,
N.Y., was arrested setting the radio-controlled bomb at U.S.
Surgical Corp. just after midnight.
   She was charged with attempted murder, possession of explosives
and manufacturing a bomb and was jailed on $500,000 bail.
   Lt. Jeff Finch said the device was a ``sophisticated bomb capable
of killing anyone near it.'' Ms. Trutt planned to detonate it as the
company's chairman, Leon Hirsch, walked by on his way to work, Finch
said.
   ``Ms. Trutt is a self-styled member of animal rights groups and
considers the policies of U.S. Surgical to be an affront to animal
rights,'' Finch said.
   Hirsch said the bomb was found at the side of the building, 10
feet from his parking space. He said about 200 people were working
in the plant overnight. A bomb squad was called in to remove the
device.
   The company has been criticized for using anesthetized live dogs
to demonstrate its surgical staplers, which are used instead of
stitches to close wounds.
   State health officials, responding to complaints by animal rights
groups, ruled recently that such use of animals does not violate
state law.
   ``I think what we and other companies should be doing is telling
the world what these animal activists are really like,'' Hirsch
said. ``The public thinks they're a wonderful group of little old
ladies, protecting puppies and pound dogs, and so they send in their
$5.''
   ``But nothing could be further from the truth. These are
hard-core animal extremists, who believe the rights of animals
supercede the rights of humans.''
   An animal rights activist who protested U.S. Surgical's use of
animals to the state said the group has ``absolutely no connection''
with Trutt.
   ``We were horrified to learn of this,'' said Julie Lewin,
Connecticut coordinator of Fund for Animals, which claims 250,000
members nationwide. ``We in no way condone any terorrism. Violence
toward people does not help animals.''
   Hirsch said U.S. Surgical experiments on about 1,000 animals,
mostly dogs, a year. The animals, which are obtained from U.S.
Department of Agriculture farms, are destroyed after experiments are
completed, he said.
   U.S. Surgical, which produces surgical stapling devices, employs
1,500 people in Connecticut and 2,600 nationwide, Hirsch said.

   Welsh Guards in bearskin caps and American
``doughboys' in vintage uniforms marched past Prince Charles and
President Francois Mitterrand on Friday in ceremonies marking the
70th anniversary of the end of World War I.
   Thousands of people lined the Champs Elysees under sunny skies
during the Armistice Day parade. Soldiers dressed in World War I
uniforms and modern French military units took part.
   Princess Diana, dressed in a black coat and veiled hat, stood
near her husband as bells rang out at the precise moment they
sounded on Nov. 11, 1918, announcing the surrender of Germany.
   The Armistice Day parade came on the last day of the British
royal couple's five-day visit to Paris. They also attended a
ceremony at Notre Dame Cathedral honoring British killed during
World War I.
   Mitterrand planned to visit the Armistice monument at Rethondes,
50 miles north of Paris, where French presidents pay homage every 10
years to countrymen killed in both world wars.
   The last president to make the Armistice pilgrimage to Rethondes
was Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1978.
   Rethondes is where France surrendered to Hitler in 1940,
beginning four years of Nazi occupation.
   More than 10 million people died in World War I, one of the
bloodiest wars in history. The Treaty of Versailles and other
treaties that ended the war radically changed the face of Europe and
the Middle East.
   In Belgium, the Duke of Kent and several British World War I
veterans attended an Armistice Day ceremony at the Menen Gate in
Ieper.
   The arch, which straddles a road leading to the nearby town of
Menen, bears the names of nearly 55,000 British soldiers who fell in
the trenches of Flanders but whose remains have never been found.
   Buglers from the Ieper fire brigade played ``Taps'' to honor
those who fell.
   The Duke also attended services at Ieper's Anglican Church and at
the town's cathedral before visiting some of the many thousands of
war graves that dot the Flemish countryside.
   The ceremonies were attended by several British World War I
veterans, now in their nineties.
   The area around Ieper saw some of the fiercest fighting of the
war, culminating in the battle of Passchendaele on a muddy ridge
eight miles away.
   The area around this West Belgian town still lives with the
legacy of the war. The Belgian army uses a special bomb squad that
regularly retrieves explosive devices left from the war, including
unexploded cannisters containing poison gas.
   Last week, the squad found 156 German mustard gas shells at
Schoonaarde, 40 miles east of Ieper. The shells were discovered by a
contractor who was leveling a building site.

   Czechoslovak police broke up an
independent seminar Friday in Prague, arrested the organizer and
told 16 foreign participants the meeting was illegal, sources in
Prague and Vienna reported.
   Dissidents and diplomats in Prague the raid on a seminar about
Czechoslovak history indicated a tougher attitude toward the growing
number of activities being conducted outside official circles.
   They said nearly all Czechoslovaks planning to attend had been
arrested Wednesday and Thursday, and about 20 were believed still in
custody Friday.
   Some Czechoslovak and foreign participants planned to resume the
seminar at an undisclosed address, said the International Helsinki
Federation for Human Rights, based in Vienna.
   Banned playwright Vaclav Havel eluded arrest Thursday and reached
a Prague hotel where the seminar was to begin with a public session
Friday, witnesses said.
   Havel managed to declare the seminar open before three
plainclothes policemen arrested him, said Dick Knook, charge
d'affaires at the Dutch Embassy in Prague.
   The playwright was chairman of the organizing committee. Sponsors
of the seminar were the Charter 77 human rights movement, the
independent Jazz Section group, an independent peace association,
the Democratic Initiative and the Czechoslovak-U.S. Friendship
Society.
   Four decades of communist rule and the founding of independent
Czechoslovakia in 1918 were among matters to be discussed in the
three-day seminar.
   Knook said another Czechoslovak avoided arrest at the hotel,
slipping out while police were busy stopping a Western woman
activist from taking photographs.
   A West German TV crew managed to film the scene at the Pariz
Hotel in central Prague.
   Foreign participants condemned ``the arbitrary actions of the
police and security services to prevent the seminar taking place''
and called the police action ``a blatant violation of the Helsinki
Final Act.''
   They protested to the Czechoslovak government, Western diplomats
and the Helsinki review conference in Vienna. The Helsinki Final Act
to human rights provisions of the 1875 Helsinki agreements on
European security and cooperation.
   Czechoslovakia's delegation to the Vienna conference said recent
police actions, including dispersing a banned but peaceful rally by
5,000 people Oct. 28, complied with national law.
   Nine ambassadors from NATO countries and the charges d'affaires
from several other Western missions met at the Dutch Embassy for a
briefing on the raid.
   Knook said Max van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister who
heads the Dutch Helsinki Committee and was in Prague for the
seminar, requested the meeting of diplomats.
   At least four Westerners who wanted to attend the seminar were
refused visas, the International Helsinki Federation said.
   An Associated Press correspondent in Vienna who met requirements
for a journalist's visa to cover the event also was refused.
   Gerald Nagler, executive director of the Helsinki Federations,
told the diplomats ``a charming lady with flowers'' arrived at the
meeting to distribute warning notes in envelopes to foreigners
present. Other witnesses reported plainclothes police handing out
such warnings.
   The notes said further participation in the seminar would be
regarded as ``a manifestation of hostility toward Czechoslovakia.''
   Some independent intellectuals not under arrest were physically
prevented from meeting with the foreigners.
   Jiri Dienstbier, a Charter 77 signatory, told the AP the two
police vans were in front of his apartment, keeping him away from
the seminar.
   Dienstbier, reached by telephone from Vienna, said three Western
participants, including Timothy Garton Ash, a British writer on
Eastern Europe, rang his apartment bell in the afternoon but were
kept out by police.
   A senior Western diplomat, also reached by telephone, said
authorities apparently were unnerved by an independent demonstration
Aug. 21, the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed the liberal ``Prague spring'' of 1968.
   Up to 10,000 people rallied to demand freedom of speech and
democracy that night and police arrested scores.
   ``They have certainly tightened the reins'' since, the diplomat
said.

   A Soviet Politburo member said Friday
that each nation should decide whether to adopt a multiparty system,
but denied that such a move eventually will prompt Hungary to bolt
from the Soviet bloc.
   Hungary is the first single-party communist country to debate
openly the growth of a multiparty system. Its fostering of political
pluralism is certain to be closely watched in the Soviet Union.
   At a joint news conference with Hungarian Politburo member Janos
Berecz, Soviet Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev said the needs
of society should determine the type of party system in any given
country.
   Berecz, chief ideologist of Hungary's ruling Communist Party,
said diverse political interest groups that recently have mushroomed
in Hungary would be given broader scope that could lead to an
unspecified coalition of parties.
   But he cautioned that enacting political reforms is a long-term
process, and emphatically ruled out a reporter's suggestion that a
multiparty system might lead Hungary out of the Soviet bloc.
   ``We will withdraw from the Warsaw Pact when NATO has
disbanded,'' Berecz told journalists.
   Hungary has been in the throes of debate over the feasibility of
a multiparty system evolving in a Communist country.
   On Thursday, the government adopted a draft bill on assembly that
would allow the foundation of political parties.
   However, the status of such parties and how they would function
is to be regulated by legislation that is still under consideration
and probably will not be ready until 1990.
   The draft bill is to be presented to parliament for approval
later this month.
   Yakovlev said the number of parties in a country or the
establishment of any party system ``follows from its internal needs
and not from intellectual considerations.''
   ``The possibility of a multiparty system ... should be decided by
the responsible leaders of (individual) countries,'' he said.
   Yakovlev was in Budapest to wrap up what Berecz called a landmark
agreement on expanding ties between the Soviet and Hungarian
communist parties.
   The two parties have grown increasingly close since Mikhail S.
Gorbachev took over as Kremlin leader in March 1985, and Karoly
Grosz replaced old-time Hungarian party chief Janos Kadar in May.
   The new agreement means the two parties will cooperate on such
matters as their role in society, property ownership and labor
relations, the Communist party daily Nepszabadsag said.
   Hungary's mushrooming independent groups, some of which are
political parties in all but name, are likely to welcome the
government's latest move to allow them a legal basis to function.
   Communist authorities have taken a different attitude to the
various groups, essentially accepting the Hungarian Democratic
Forum. But the Soviet bloc's first independent youth group _ the
Federation of Young Democrats _ has complained of an official media
boycott.
   Hungary's latest action is likely to be watched closely also in
the Soviet Union's Baltic states, where independent political
movements have recently attracted hundreds of thousands of
supporters.
   Those movements, which have the approval of Baltic communist
parties, grew rapidly after a visit by Yakovlev to the Baltic states
last summer.
   He said he had heard nothing in the Baltics that gave him ``cause
for anxiety,'' but cautioned that excessive nationalism would not be
tolerated.
   The more conservative communist governments in Czechoslovakia,
which has cracked down hard on independent groups recently, and East
Germany are likely to be wary of the move.
   When asked about the possibility of a multiparty system evolving
in the Soviet Union, Yakovlev responded, ``I don't understand such
questions. I could ask when will there be real multiparty systems
elsewhere.''
   He said he had studied the U.S. party system for years and ``I
can't identify a second party any more.''

   The crystal ball has been the central artifact on exhibit in the

   A concert featuring Soviet musicians, poets,
playwrights and artists will be staged here Sunday in support of an
officially sanctioned Soviet committee building a monument to Josef
Stalin's victims.
   The Adelphi Theater concert is intended to restore cultural works
repressed under Stalin's 29-year regime ``and the living work of
today ... (which) cannot proceed without the history of those who
were killed,'' said the organizer, actress Vanessa Redgrave.
   ``It is in prose and poetry the story of what Stalinist
bureaucracy is,'' she told a news conference.
   Ms. Redgrave and British film director Sir Richard Attenborough
will be among those addressing a rally before the concert, which
will include poetry and prose recitations, excerpts from plays,
songs and music.
   Among the performers will be British actress Susannah York,
American playwright Martin Sherman and Soviet poet Sergei Yursky.
   Proceeds from the concert at the 1,500-capacity theater will go
toward building a monument in Moscow to Stalin's victims.
   Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Stalin and his
legacy have come in for increasingly severe criticism. In July, the
Communist Party Politburo approved the building of the monument.
   A public council to supervise the construction and maintenance of
the monument was formed in August. Among those selected for the
council were dissident and Nobel Prize laureate Andrei D. Sakharov
and poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko.

   A gynecologist accused by patients of
performing vaginal reconstructive surgery without their knowledge
has been barred from practicing surgery in Ohio while the state
medical board investigates.
   The board announced the action against Dr. James C. Burt in a
statement Thursday.
   ``The limitation, which was obtained through an agreement with
Dr. Burt, does not prevent the board from pursuing further
disciplinary action,'' the board said. ``The investigation of Dr.
Burt's medical practice remains an urgent priority.''
   Burt's attorney, Earl Moore, declined to comment on the board's
action.
   Some former patients have charged that Burt performed surgery
designed to enhance their sexual responsiveness while they were
under anesthesia for other procedures, and that the operation made
intercourse excruciatingly painful.
   After a CBS-TV report on the allegations Oct. 29 and the
disclosure that the board had been investigating Burt, Gov. Richard
Celeste called on the board to expedite its probe.
   Burt has said the picture CBS painted of him was ``100 percent
erroneous and false.''
   No criminal charges have been filed against the doctor.
   Several women have filed malpractice suits against Burk over
surgery they claimed injured them.

   Doctors were monitoring Emperor Hirohito carefully
Friday for signs of more bleeding after his blood pressure and
temperature rose, palace officials said.
   Hirohito spent much of the morning sleeping, but talked actively
with his son, Crown Prince Akihito, when he visited during the
afternoon, Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
   The emperor's fourth daughter, Atsuko Ikeda, and her husband also
visited the bedridden monarch, and said he appeared weary and only
whispered ``thank you'' to them, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Maeda said the 87-year-old emperor's blood pressure at late
afternoon was 138 over 60, compared with 110 over 54 the previous
day. A normal reading is about 120 over 80.
   Physicians were concerned that his higher blood pressure could
increase the chances of additional internal bleeding in the area of
his upper intestine, officials said.
   Several times since his condition worsened on Sept. 19, Hirohito
has discharged large amounts of blood from his bowels because of
internal bleeding. After each large discharge his blood pressure has
dropped dangerously, and doctors fear his weak body has become less
able to recover despite emergency blood transfusions.
   The emperor's temperature rose to 100.4 Friday from 99.5 on
Thursday, while his pulse rate climbed to 100 from 86, Maeda said.
Hirohito's normal temperature is about 95.9.
   Maeda said the emperor had not discharged any blood Friday for
the third straight day and was not given any transfusions. The
monarch has received 41 pints of blood since he fell ill.

crowned ``Miss Beauty'' this week in the first such contest in
Vietnam since the Communist Party came to power in 1975, Vietnamese
media said.
   The winner _ identified by the Vietnam News Agency as Bui Bich
Mai and by Radio Hanoi as Bui Bic Phuong _ received a tiara worth
about $70.
   The first-year student in the Foreign Languages Department of
Hanoi University beat nearly 90 contestants ranging from 16 to 28
years old.
   The first runner-up was Nguyen Thu Mai, a student at the Army
School of Arts, who received about $38.
   In the semifinal Wednesday, contestants wore summer dresses,
including the long national dress, the ``ao dai,'' and swimsuits,
Radio Hanoi said.
   Ten women were chosen as finalists Thursday in the contest held
in Hanoi.
   Other contestants received the titles ``Graceful Ao Dai,''
``Capital's Miss Elegance,'' ``Miss Fashionable,'' ``Miss Manners,''
and ``Person Who Makes the Earth Beautiful.''
   ``Apart from their gracefulness and charm, the contestants were
also required to answer questions about the Communist Youth Union
and society,'' the Vietnam News Agency said.
   The contest was sponsored by the Tien Phong, or Vanguard, weekly
publication for youth.
   ``This is the first such contest organized since the
reunification of the country and in honor of the 35th founding
anniversary of the weekly,'' the agency said.
   Vietnam has been ruled by a doctrinaire autocracy since North
Vietnam defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam in 1975, but conditions
have been somewhat relaxed after more pragmatic leaders took office
in 1986.

   The president of Parliament resigned
Friday, bowing to condemnation of a speech in which he said many
Germans felt Adolf Hitler brought ``glorious times'' before the
Holocaust and global war.
   Philipp Jenninger referred to Hitler's early years as a
``triumphal procession'' in an address that also condemned the Nazi
attempt to annihilate European Jews.
   The 56-year-old Christian Democrat said he had been
misunderstood, was shocked by the reaction and felt ``deeply sorry''
for any offense caused by his remarks Thursday on the 50th
anniversary of Kristallnacht, the rampage against Jews that began
the Nazi genocide.
   Jenninger emphasized his own record as a foe of totalitarian
regimes.
   In a television interview Friday night, Jenninger said he had
hoped to reach young people by describing horrors of the Nazi past,
but ``you have to learn that you can't call everything by its name
in Germany.''
   Michael Fuerst, deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
West Germany, defended the politician.
   ``I welcome that the Parliament president described in full
clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938,
especially the fact that everything that Hitler did was strongly
supported by the masses of all Germans,'' he said in a television
interview Thursday night.
   On Friday, Neue Presse of Hanover quoted Jewish Council chairman
Heinz Galinski as saying of Jenninger: ``No one is supporting him.
That's shown by the numerous protests that have reached me from all
Jewish communities.''
   Whatever his intent, Jenninger's speech contained lengthy
references to the euphoria many Germans felt after Hitler gained
power in 1933, occasionally without counterbalancing statements
about the Nazi atrocities.
   He used rhetorical questions in many passages, including this one:
   ``And as far as the Jews were concerned, hadn't they claimed for
themselves in the past a role that wasn't right for them? Hadn't
they deserved being put back in their place? And above all, didn't
the propaganda _ apart from the wild exaggeration not to be taken
seriously _ correspond in essential points to their own conjectures
and convictions?
   ``And when it got so bad, as it was in November 1938, people
could still say, using the words of a contemporary _ `What's it to
us, look away if it terrifies you. It is not our fate.'''
   About 50 members of Parliament began to walk out at that point in
the speech, which was broadcast live on national television.
   In his resignation announcement, Jenninger said: ``The reactions
to my speech ... have deeply shocked me and have greatly depressed
me.
   ``My speech was not understood by many listeners the way I had
intended it to be. I am deeply sorry and I am very hurt, if I have
offended the feelings of others.
   ``During my whole political career ... I have been active in
working for reconciliation with the Jews and for the vital interests
of the state of Israel.''
   ``I always have been an uncompromising foe of every type of
totalitarian rule,'' he said, and cited ``the experiences of my
parents under the Nazi regime, who were opposed to the dictatorship
and as a result had to accept disadvantages.'' He did not describe
the disadvantages.
   Jenninger did not say whether he would continue in Parliament. He
has been a member since 1969 and was a close aide to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl before becoming president four years ago.
   The presidency of Parliament is largely ceremonial, but in terms
of diplomatic protocol is the No. 2 public office after the federal
presidency.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the opposition Social Democrats,
told reporters after Jenninger's resignation: ``This event shows us
how the darkest chapter of German history is still a present-day
thing.''
   A statement by the leftist Greens party said: ``The background of
what happened is the inability of many Germans to stand up to their
own past.''
   An editorial in the Frankfurter Rundschau said it was ``perhaps
the most unfortunate speech that was ever made in the Federal
Republic,'' but also said of Jenninger: ``You can grant him the good
intention of wanting to give a worthy, perhaps even great
contribution to the memory of the crimes of the Third Reich on this
historic day.''
   The furor overshadowed West Germany's carefully planned
ceremonies for the anniversary of the night of terror Nov. 9-10,
1938, which the Nazis named Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night, for the
shattered glass that littered the streets.
   Nazi thugs destroyed 267 synagogues in West Germany, killed 91
Jews, rounded up 30,000 for shipment to concentration camps,
destroyed Jewish homes and ransacked 7,500 Jewish businesses. The
same thing happened in Austria, Hitler's homeland, which he had
annexed to the Third Reich eight months earlier.
   Kristallnacht began what became known as the Holocaust, in which
6 million Jews were killed.
   In his speech Thursday, Jenninger described the positive feelings
of many Germans in the early Hitler years:
   ``Didn't Hitler bring to reality what (Kaiser) Wilhelm II had
only promised, that is to lead the Germans to glorious times? Wasn't
he chosen by Providence, a Fuehrer such as is given to a people only
once in a thousand years?
   ``For the fate of the Germans and European Jews, Hitler's
successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and
misdeeds. The years from 1933 to 1938, even from a distant
retrospective and in the knowledge of what followed, still are a
fascinating thing today, since throughout history there was hardly a
parallel to Hitler's triumphal procession during the first years.''

   A bomb exploded at a building of the ruling
Motherland Party, causing panic in the neighborhood but no injuries,
a party official said Friday.
   The bomb went off late Thursday night on a first-floor balcony of
the building, which was empty at the time, said Ali Turkyasar, the
head of the party's Mamak district in Ankara.
   The blast shattered some of the building's windows and caused
panic among residents of the neighborhood, Turkyasar said.
   Police were investigating.

   A boat overloaded with moviegoers sank in
a canal in southern Andhra Pradesh state, and at least 20 people
drowned, Indian news agencies said Friday.
   The boat was carrying 70 people at the time of the accident in
the Yenamadaru canal late Thursday, said Press Trust of India.
   The bodies of 17 victims _ 10 women, three men and four children
_ have been recovered, district officials told the United News of
India news agency.
   The accident site is about 800 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   District authorities have issued warrants for the arrest of two
boatmen absconding after the accident, UNI said. They have been
charged with causing the accident because of negligence and
overloading, the news agency said.

   Pro-Nazi slogans appeared on the walls
of two schools and a museum during a visit to a small town by a
group of Jewish former residents, town officials said Friday.
   ``Auschwitz was too small,'' said one slogan, referring to the
infamous Nazi death camp. ``That's the way to the gas chamber,''
said another sign, according to city officials in Wesel.
   The signs appeared in the nearby town of Xanten, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Wesel and Xanten are
about 25 miles northwest of Duesseldorf.
   The group consisted of 16 Jews from the United States, Israel,
England and the Netherlands. They fled from the Wesel and Xanten
area after the Nazis came to power in 1933, the officials said.
   The visit was planned to coincide with ceremonies marking the
50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the first organized Nazi pogrom
against Jews.
   The mayors of Wesel and Xanten apologized to the group, which
left Wesel Friday.

<TEXT>
   Exasperated health officials are
distributing 20,000 bumper stickers that read ``Dirty Hands Spread
Disease: Wash Them'' in a battle against a hepatitis A epidemic.
   The novel approach to disease prevention is a last-ditch effort
by Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department officials to stem a
disease that has increased tenfold in the Puget Sound area over the
past three years.
   The disease, passed through fecal matter, is most commonly spread
by people who don't wash their hands after using the restroom and
then handle food that they or other people eat, health officials say.
   ``We decided we had to do something different to try to stop
this,'' said Allene Mares, the health del charged
with leading the fight.
   Hepatitis A shows little sign of letting up in the Puget Sound
region, Ms. Mares said Thursday. The county health deparpartment officiatment
usually sees about 30 to 40 cases a year. But since 1986, the number
of cases reported annually has been in the hundreds. So far this
year, more than 350 residents have been hit.
   In 1987, there were 2,500 cases of hepatitis A in the state,
compared with an average of 300 to 700 during the early 1980s.
   Dr. John Kobayashi of the state Department of Social and Health
Services has said the trend this year seems to be keeping pace with
last year. A specific fi repressions.
   There was no immediate police interference in the Warsaw march.
Last year, police allowed only a few of about 5,000 marchers to
reach the tomb. The rest were dispersed by baton-swinging officers.
   In the western city of Poznan, a battle erupted between riot
police and about 4,000 demonstrators, said Alexandra Bessert, a
Solidarity activist. She said battle lasted about two hours and
described police as ``unusually aggressive and brutal.''
   Ms. Bessert said scores of people were detained.
   The officer on duty at city police headquarters denied there was
any police action. ``Poznan is a very peaceful city,'' he said,
before hanging up.
   In Wroclaw, Jozef Pinior, a leader of the banned Polish Socialist
Party, said marchers walked to a street-car depot where the local
Solidarity chapter began in 1980, carrying signs saying, ``We want
free elections'' and ``Reform through democracy.''
   He said the crowd started with 3,000 people and grew to 10,000.
   In Lublin, in southeastern Poland, Bishop Boleslaw Pylak
celebrated Mass and Ryszard Bender, a parliament deputy who has
called for making Nov. 11 a national holiday, addressed a rally on
the city's main square, Bender said by phone.
   Official attitudes toward the anniversary have softened since the
1981 declaration of martial law, with the military government
embracing popular patriotic symbols and urging unity in the name of
the ``Ojczyzna'' or ``Fatherland.''
   On the broad expanse of Victory Square, Polish Communist Party
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, wearing his army uniform and
accompanied by Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, presided at
hourlong official ceremonies.
   Honor guards representing various branches and divisions of the
military paid homage to the nation, and ambassadors to Poland laid
wreathes at the unknown soldier's tomb, which was guarded by
soldiers in uniforms from different epochs of Polish history.

<HEAD>New Law to Crack Down on Wildlife Poachers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law will take effect March 1 in China to
protect endangered wildlife from poaching that involves even the
state's security personnel, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported Friday.
   Frontier guards and armed police in some provinces have used
their weapons to wantonly hunt wildlife, the New Evening Post quoted
an unidentified official from the Chinese Ministry of Forestry as
saying.
   Illegal hunting of more than 20 endangered species such as the
giant panda and golden monkey is getting worse, the report said, and
the new law will be designed to put a stop to it.
   Other illegal activity such as smuggling wildlife products also
is on the rise, the report said, noting that 1,639 pounds of musk
was smuggled to Japan in the first four months of 1987. Since last
year, three giant panda skins and three golden monkey skins were
smuggled into Hong Kong, the newspaper said.
   Since 1986, authorities seized 251 red deer and elk that were
shot dead by hunters in Inner Mongolia. In Anhui province, more than
30 Yangtze River crocodiles were poached.
   Tigers and leopards in southern China were among other endangered
species bagged by hunters.
   The newspaper did not provide details of the laws provisions or
what penalties poachers would pay for hunting endangered species.

   More than 70 people were injured in an earthquake
that hit China's southeast coast, and the number reported homeless
from another quake in the south earlier this week doubled to
200,000, officials said Friday.
   No deaths were reported in Thursday's quake, which shook the
Guangxi Zhuang region. The official China News service said it
measured slightly more than 5 on the Richter scale and cracked
buildings and collapsed stairways in cities across the area.
   It occurred four days after a quake near the Burmese border
killed more than 930 people. The official Xinhua News Agency quoted
officials as raising the count of those injured Sunday by several
hundred, to 3,364.
   Seismologists said Thursday's quake may have been an aftershock
of that temblor, which devastated dozens of remote towns and farming
villages in Yunnan province, west of Guangxi Zhuang. It measured 7.6
on the Richter scale.
   The China News Service said Thursday's quake was centered
offshore in the Beibu Gulf. It said 71 people were were hurt, nine
seriously, as they scrambled from buildings in the city of
Fangcheng. It said the trade city of Canton also was affected.
   Trevor Page of the U.N. World Food Program said Chinese officials
told him 200,000 people were homeless from the Yunnan quake, twice
as many as previously reported.
   Page said the Ministry of Civil Affairs sent his office a
detailed list of emergency supply needs, including antibiotics,
syringes, portable X-rays, jeeps, plastic sheets, tents, clothing
and canned food.
   Xinhua said 75 tons of medicine and 24 tons of food already had
been sent to the quake area by helicopter, truck and horse-drawn
cart. Many villages in the area can reached only on footpaths and
the few existing roads have been heavily damaged by the quake.
   Xinhua said many remote villages had not yet been reached by
rescue teams and that the casualty figures were expected to rise.
   A strong quake hit the same area in October.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated
area, and a quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

   Hundreds of troops poured into Jerusalem's
walled Old City Friday and the army sealed off the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip to prevent violence linked to the expected
proclamation of a Palestinian state.
   Soldiers detained hundreds of Palestinians in anticipation of
anti-occupation riots during the four-day meeting of the Palestine
National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   The council is expected to declare an independent Palestinian
state during its meeting, which begins Saturday in Algiers.
   In the Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded three Arab protesters
with plastic bullets, hospital officials said. There was no
immediate comment from the army.
   Israel television said two boys, aged 12 and 15, were shot and
wounded by live ammunition in A-Tur, an Arab area in East Jerusalem.
   It was not immediately clear who fired at them, and police were
investigating whether they were shot by a civilian responding to a
stoning attack on a car, the television said.
   Since the uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip began Dec. 8, 310 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died.
   Hundreds of soldiers dressed in combat gear and armed with
assault weapons streamed into Jerusalem's Old City, which has a
large Arab population. Many carried backpacks and bedding,
apparently to set up temporary camps inside the ancient walls.
   The army announced the entire Gaza Strip was closed at 9 p.m. and
placed an indefinite curfew on the coastal area's 650,000 Arab
residents. The order barred journalists from entering Gaza without
an army escort.
   The actions did not affect Gaza's 6,000 Jewish settlers.
   Troops also barred West Bank Palestinians from entering
Jerusalem, erecting roadblocks at all entry points to the city. Army
officials said the West Bank's 850,000 Palestinians were confined to
their own districts.
   The army put up three checkpoints on the Bethlehem-Jerusalem
highway, turning away Jerusalem-bound cars with blue West Bank
license plates.
   In an unusual move, troops also questioned drivers of
yellow-plated Israeli cars and in one instance ordered an Arab
laborer riding in a car with his Israeli employer to stay behind.
   Dozens of riot police patrolled the narrow alleys of Bethlehem
and two army jeeps escorted Israeli buses passing through the
biblical city.
   An army spokesman said journalists were free to enter the West
Bank, but state-run Israeli radio reported Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin was considering banning media from the area.
   A number of journalists were turned back Friday from the West
Bank cities of Ramallah and Nablus.
   At checkpoints outside Ramallah, troops barred residents from
leaving for Jerusalem and soldiers checked identity cards. Graffiti
sprayed on walls read: ``Yes to the PNC'' and ``Yes to the
independent state.''
   Arab reports said the army disconnected the loudspeakers of seven
Gaza mosques to prevent Moslem preachers from reaching worshipers
during noon prayers.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   Throughout the occupied areas, hundreds of Palestinian activists
were rounded up overnight, Arab reports said.
   An army official said only that Israel has ``ongoing initiatives
to round up troublemakers,'' but would not elaborate.
   A group of Jewish settlers in the West Bank declared stones a
murder weapon and called on settlers to shoot stone-throwing
Palestinians, Israel radio reported.
   A settler opened fire Friday on Palestinians who stoned a bus he
was traveling in near the Jelazoun refugee camp, the radio said. No
one was injured.
   The army said it was looking for the settler and would take
action against him for violating laws that allow civilians to fire
only in self-defense.
   A spokesman for PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Bassam Abu Sharif,
said a declaration of independence for the West Bank and Gaza Strip
would be a key legal move in transforming the territories into
Palestine.
   Israeli officials say such a declaration would incite more
violence in the occupied territories.
   Abu Sharif, speaking to reporters in Algiers, also claimed there
was an Israeli plan to assassinate Palestine Liberation Organization
leaders and that Arafat was first on the list.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, accused
Abu Sharif of making the claim for publicity.

   Authorities found the
remains of an apparent stowaway in the landing gear of a Boeing 737
after the aircraft had trouble lowering its wheels, officials said
Friday.
   The chartered Air Europa jet carrying 111 passengers left
Hanover, West Germany, on Thursday and landed on this Spanish island
in the Mediterranean.
   Authorities said the aircraft experienced problems with its
landing gear during its approach to Son San Joan Airport, forcing it
into a holding pattern for two hours.
   Once the right side of the landing gear lowered properly, the jet
landed without incident, Air Europa said in a statement.
   The ground crew subsequently found blood and other remains, a
ring and a piece of candy in a landing gear well, ``which led them
to believe in the existence of a stowaway,'' the Palma-based company
said.
   The crew informed local authorities of their findings, but no
body was found despite an intensive search, police said.
   Company director Tomas Cano was quoted by the Spanish national
news agency EFE Friday as saying the person who hid in the jet's
landing gear ``sentenced himself to death, due to the inevitably
fatal lack of oxygen in the well and the extremely low
temperatures'' during flights.
   Police in Hanover originally thought the stowaway may have been
an 11-year-old boy reported missing on Thursday. The boy had been
taken to a school bus by his mother but never arrived at school,
raising fears he may have tried to stow away on the Air Europa jet.
   But police said the youngster had fled to look for his father.
The boy's parents are separated, police said.

   Philipp Jenninger said once he entered
politics in 1963 because his father told him to ``be of service''
and help prevent another war.
   Jenninger, 56, resigned Friday as president of Parliament after
sharp criticism of a speech in which he said many Germans felt Adolf
Hitler's early years were ``glorious.''
   He also condemned the Nazis in his address to Parliament on
Thursday, the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night of terror
that began Hitler's extermination of 6 million Jews.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl criticized his close friend and former
aide for the tone of the speech, the conservative Die Welt newspaper
said.
   In his resignation announcement, Jenninger said he always had
opposed ``every type of totalitarian rule'' and has been a
consistent supporter of Israel.
   He told reporters in 1982 he entered public service because his
father told him the world must avoid another war like the one Hitler
started in 1939.
   ``Two of my brothers died in the war. My father told me when I
was 12: `Be of service during your lifetime so that something like
this can never again happen.' That influenced me,'' Jenninger said.
   He is a member of Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union
and reached the highest position in Parliament on a reputation for
fairness and effectiveness.
   As a close aide to Kohl, Jenninger was a leading figure in
persuading communist East Germany to let more of its people visit or
move to West Germany.
   He also was involved in preparations for a visit to West Germany
by East German leader Erich Honecker in 1984 that was vetoed by the
Soviet Union. Last year, Honecker became the first East German
leader to visit West Germany.
   Jenninger was born June 10, 1932, at Rindelbach in what is now
Baden-Wuerttenberg state, and earned a doctor of law degree in 1957
from the University of Tuebingen. He entered politics in 1963 as an
adviser in the Defense Ministry.
   From 1966 until he won a Parliament seat in 1969, Jenninger was a
political adviser to Franz Josef Strauss, a powerful conservative
politician from Bavaria who was finance minister. Strauss died last
month.
   Jenninger became the Christian Democratic Union's chief
parliamentary secretary in 1975, in charge of coordinating its
legislative affairs. When Kohl became chancellor in October 1982, he
made Jenninger state minister in the Chancellery.
   On Nov. 4, 1984, Jenninger became president of Parliament in
place of Rainer Barzel, who resigned in a corruption scandal. The
members elected him with 340 of 469 votes.

   Four nations resumed talks Friday on securing a
Cuban troop pullout from Angola and an independence plan for
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   Delegations from South Africa, Cuba, Angola and the United
States, which is mediating, opened the new round with a series of
discussions, a South African spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Roland Darrol, said his delegation came to
Switzerland ``in a positive frame of mind.''
   No plans were immediately announced for full meetings of the four
sides, all of which have sent mid-level officials to the talks.
   The closed-door talks, part of a series begun in May, are due to
end Sunday. They are intended to prepare for a furtherround in
Brazzaville, Congo, the date of which have not been set.
   The goal is an accord on the withdrawal of an estimated 50,000
Cuban troops backing a Marxist government in Angola. A pullout
agreement is South Africa's condition for granting freedom to
South-West Africa, the former German colony between South Africa and
Angola that Pretoria has controlled for 73 years.
   Soviet deputy foreign minister Anatoly Adamyshin, in Geneva as
observer, said Thursday that the length and timing of the Cuban
pullout was the only remaining issue to be settled.
   Angola's ambassador to the United Nations, Manuel Pedro Pacavira,
said in New York an agreement on the withdrawal of Cuban troops is
near and may come during the current talks.
   But he said the troop withdrawal is not the major hurdle.
   ``We cannot say that the main obstacle (to an agreement) is the
timetable,'' Pacavira told reporters. He blamed South Africa's
``attitude of interference'' in Angola's affairs for the current
impasse in the talks.
   But South African delegation leader Neil van Heerden indicated he
would also raise an alleged breach by Angola of its pledge to keep
Namibian guerrillas north of the 16th parallel in Angola.
   Military units of the South-West African People's Organization
fighting for Namibian independence have bases in southern Angola.
   Pretoria originally proposed Nov. 1 as target date for
implementing a U.N. independence plan for Namibia.
   As it became clear that goal would not be met, a U.S. proposal in
early October reportedly called for Cuba to withdraw half of its
contingent from Angola by Aug. 1. The remaining troops were to be
confined to northern Angola and withdrawn in stages by the end of
1990.
   Cuba reportedly wants a 30-month timetable, six months longer
than that offered by Washington and Pretoria.
   Washington reportedly suggested Jan. 1 as a new Namibia target
date, with elections scheduled Aug. 1.
   But meeting the date seems unlikely, according to sources in
South Africa, because the U.N. says it would need at least six weeks
to assemble a peacekeeping force after the signing of an accord.
This would mean that an agreement would have to be signed by
mid-November.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of oil refinery
workers went on strike Friday and threatened to bring Brazil's 10
refineries to a standstill unless their salaries are raised,
officials said.
   It was the latest in a wave of labor unrest caused by a
sputtering economy under President Jose Sarney. On Wednesday, a
confrontation between striking steelworkers and police and soldiers
left three people dead.
   Glaucio Heemann, a spokesman for the state-owned oil monopoly
Petrobras, said half the country's 60,000 oil refinery workers
walked off their jobs and ``we expect that by the end of the day the
other half will do the same.''
   If this happens, the refineries will stop producing their daily
output of 600,000 barrels of gasoline and another 900,000 barrels of
diesel oil, cooking gas and other petroleum byproducts, Heemann said.
   He said Petrobras has a 20-day supply of fuel, ``and if the
strike lasts this long the country will face serious problems.''
   Durval Gomes, one of the directors of the Rio de Janeiro Refinery
Workers Union, said strikers are demanding a 154 percent pay
increase and that Petrobras offered 67.27 percent. He said refinery
workers earn an average of $1,365 a month.
   He said the two sides were expected to resume negotiations soon
in Brasilia, the capital.
   On Wednesday, thousands of striking steelworkers angered by
shrinking paychecks stormed Brazil's biggest steel mill and hurled
rocks and bombs at police and soldiers. Two workers were fatally
shot and another was bludgeoned to death, plant officials said.
   The confrontation occurred at the National Steel Company in Volta
Redonda, 80 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Brazil has been beset by soaring inflation that erodes buying
power. Sarney, the first civilian leader after 21 years of military
rule, has been unable to check it.
   Since Sarney took office in April 1985, inflation has jumped from
7.2 percent a month to 27.5 percent in October _ an annual rate of
more than 1,000 percent.
   The cause, most economists agree, is a federal deficit caused by
overspending. But the government's response has been to lower
salaries, a controversial solution in a country where most workers
earn less than $30 a week.

   The federal decision to build a $4.4 biltional attainment,'' it said.
   In a section on Agent Orange, the Legion study said there were
``significant dose-related relationships between exposure to
herbicides and subsequent development of skin conditions such as
rash with blisters and change in skin color.''
   The study also connected Agent Orange exposure to benign fatty
tumors and ``a dose-related risk for miscarriage among wives of
Agent Orange-exposed veterans.''
   Agent Orange, named for the color of containers used to transport
and store the chemical, was a powerful mixture of two types of
herbicides. It was sprayed in Vietnam from 1962 to 1971 to kill
vegetation, such as dense jungle, that provided cover and protection
for Viet Cong soldiers and their supply routes.
   The spraying stopped after laboratory studies showed that dioxin,
one of the Agent Orange ingrediants, caused cancer in laboratory
animals.
   Since the end of the Vietnam war, there have been a number of
studies both supporting and contradicting the contention that Agent
Orange caused ill health among Vietnam veterans.
   In July, the CDC reported that a physical examination of
thousands of Vietnam veterans showed ``the perceived exposure to
herbicides is associated both with psychological problems and with
self-reported adverse health conditions, but is not associated with
objective measures of exposure.''
   Also in July, the VA reported that based on the physical
examination of 220,000 Vietnam veterans there were no ``upills, among high
combat veterans. Self-reporting of illicit drug use, however, was
low.
   _The rate of post-traumatic stress disorder ranged from 1.8 to 15
percent, depending on the level of combat experienced. PTSD is the
tendency to experience emotional reactions to life-threatening
stress situations long after the situations have passed. The study
said that in some cases the symptoms persisted for as long as 20
years.
   _Combat was related to the self-reported incidence of high blood
pressure, ulcers and various types of disease.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police on Friday found the
bullet-riddled body of President Prosper Avril's brother-in-law
inside a car, Radio Soleil reported.
   The Roman Catholic-run station said the body was indentified as
Louis-Marie Bonnet, an immigration department supervisor who worked
at the airport.
   Bonnet, 28, was married to the younger sister of Marie-Ange
Avril, the president's wife. The sister's name was not available.
   Witnesses told the radio they heard gunshots Thursday night but
were too frightened to come out. The body was found at 9:30 a.m.
Friday.
   Airport workers described Bonnet as efficient and honest.
   Avril came to power in a Sept. 17 coup led by rank-and-file
soldiers demanding democratic reforms. Avril replaced Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy.
   Namphy came to power in February 1986 after Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled into exile in France.

<HEAD>Submarine May Represent Latest Vogue In Drug-Smuggling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A mysterious 21-foot unmanned submarine
discovered off Florida's coast may represent the latest in
drug-smuggling techniques, but drug officials are sidestepping
comment on the underwater capsule.
   Boat experts say the submarine was designed so a smuggler could
tow it behind his boat, submerging it by remote control if law
agents approached, then retrieving the cargo later.
   ``Drug dealers are very creative,'' said police Sgt. Alan Dares.
   There were no drugs found aboard the sub, which was spotted by
surfers and retrieved Thursday by local salvager David Kellerman.
   The hatch, equipped with a wrench, could be opened only from the
outside. The red-painted interior of the capsule was empty except
for 4,000 pounds of lead bars serving as ballast. It had no
portholes and apparently was not designed to carry people.
   Federal drug investigators didn't want to comment.
   U.S. Customs Service officials inspected the sub Thursday, but
declined to say anything.
   ``I can't say whether we've seen anything like this before. It's
confidential,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer James Carr.
   Keven Peterson, general manager of H.A. Perry Foundation Inc.,
which builds small submarines in Riviera Beach, said there are
legitimate purposes for such craft, but doubts this submarine was
engaged in one.
   ``In my 27 years in the business, I've never seen anything like
it. It looks like something that would carry cargo like drugs,''
Peterson said. ``The only other thing it could be used for is
electronics, but it doesn't look sophisticated enough.''
   Discovered Wednesday and first dismissed as a barge float,
interest in the mysterious capsule resurfaced when Kellerman got it
to the beach and opened up the hatch.
   ``We didn't know if we were going to find a body. Everybody said
it might be Jimmy Hoffa in it,'' said Kellerman, referring to the
former Teamsters president who disappeared a number of years ago.
   A few wires remained on the sub's outside surface, possibly the
umbilical cord of a remote control system. It had four air tanks,
two on each side, with metal grid walkways over them. A rudder-like
stabilizer 5 feet high and 7 feet wide was at the rear.
   One local law enforcement agent, who asked not to be identified,
told the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel that ``There is no other use
for it'' than drug smugglng.
   Kellerman can keep the sub if no one claims it, police said.
Another salvager, Rick Varney, estimated the sub is worth $20,000.

<HEAD>Panel Hears Argument For Higher Judges' Pay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasing numbers of judges are quitting the
federal bench because they can make far more money in private legal
practice, two former judges and the American Bar Association said
Friday in urging a pay increase for the jurists.
   ``The long neglect of the basic need of our federal judges for
fair and just salaries has reached the point where the effective
functioning of the federal court system is endangered,'' said Robert
D. Raven, president of the ABA, in testimony before a presidential
panel studying pay increases for top federal officials.
   Raven said an ABA review found that dozens of federal judges
intend to quit because they can earn more in private practice.
   Raven's statement was echoed by two former judges, Robert Duncan
of Columbus, Ohio, and Lynn C. Higby of Panama City, Fla. Both told
the commission they quit to earn more money.
   The panel is known formally as the President's Quadrennial
Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries and it
meets after every presidential election to review the salaries of
members of Congress, judges, and top executive-branch officials,
including Cabinet officers.
   If the panel recommends a pay increase and that proposal is
endorsed by President Reagan in the budget he sends Congress on Jan.
9, the hike would go into effect unless both the House and Senate
vote against it within 30 days.
   Members of Congress and federal judges are now paid $89,500,
while federal appellate judges are paid $94,500.
   The panel focused Friday on judges, hearing testimony that
lawyers in private practice can earn far more than the jurists.
Former Chief Justice Warren Burger told the panel earlier that
judicial pay should be raised to $150,000.
   ``Compensation is the single most important factor in the
decision of judges to shorten their tenure,'' said Raven. ``This
threat to the stability of the federal judiciary can be averted if
the promise of adequate judicial compensation is finally kept.''
   Duncan was a judge for 11 years, until he resigned in April 1985.
``A reason for my resignation was abysmally low pay,'' he said.
   ``In 1985, I was earning $76,000 per year, certainly compensation
substantially more than most Americans were earning, but grossly
less than lawyers with 33 years' experience,'' he said.
   Duncan said he liked being a judge and ``the decision to leave
the bench was agonizing.''
   But he accepted an offer from a Columbus law firm in 1985 because
``at age 57, I had limited productive years ahead and I also knew
that if I entered private practice, I could afford to educate our
youngest daughter, repair our house, my wife could retire and
finally, my earnings are somewhat comparable to the income earned by
a number of law school classmates.''
   Higby was a judge in Pensacola, Fla., until he quit in 1982 to go
back to a law firm.
   ``Fortunately, I was able to return to the private practice of
law earning as much, if not more, than when I went on the bench and
most importantly, was able to fulfill my obligation to my (three)
children to see that they had the same educational opportunity that
was given me by my parents,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Ambassador Demands Follow-Up Conference In East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief Soviet delegate to the 35-nation
Helsinki conference on European security and cooperation indicated
Friday that Moscow may jeopardize other agreements at the forum if
it isn't allowed to hold a human rights conference in 1991.
   At a news conference, Yuri B. Kashlev dismissed demands from the
United States and Britain for better Soviet human rights performance
before the West could agree to Moscow holding the conference, citing
what he called those countries' poor records on human rights.
   The Soviets have agreed to a proposal that the Moscow conference
be the third in a series of annual conferences on human rights
planned after the Vienna meeting finishes this year or early in 1989.
   The first two conferences are slated for Paris in 1989 and
Copenhagen in 1990.
   ``By and large, this is a very reasonable, optimum structure,''
Kashlev said in a speech to a closed-door plenary session of
diplomats from the 35 nations at the conference.
   ``But if someone wants to break a part of it, the whole structure
will be put in doubt,'' he added.
   He noted only one follow-up meeting in the Helsinki process had
been held in the East bloc since the Soviet Union, the United
States, Canada and all European nations bar Albania signed the
Helsinki Final Act in 1975.
   ``Those from across the ocean are virtually saying that no
follow-up meetings can be conducted in Socialist countries,''
Kashlev said. ``We will not allow that to happen.''
   The dispute over the Moscow conference is one of the main
outstanding quarrels to be resolved before the Vienna conference,
started two years ago, can wind up.
   Diplomats from East, West and neutral nations say that most other
outstanding disagreements have been resolved, paving the way for new
East-West talks on limiting conventional arms and human rights
provisions hailed as unprecedented on all sides.
   Asked about recent police crackdowns in Czechoslovakia, Kashlev
noted that ``there are some developments which cause disputes'' in
East bloc countries, but defended the Czechoslovak behavior as being
in accordance with national laws.
   ``Many of the events causing regret in the West are conducted
with provocative intent,'' he charged.
   Czechoslovakia's recent behavior has provoked speeches from the
U.S. and British delegations charging Prague is violating the spirit
and the letter of the Helsinki accords on security, cooperation and
human rights in Europe.

   Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun's campaign on
Friday asked for a recount in the gubernatorial election he narrowly
lost to incumbent Gov. Edward DiPrete.
   Kenneth Haupt, Sundlun's campaign manager, hand-delivered the
letter to the Board of Elections, where workers labored through the
Veterans Day holiday to count about 16,000 absentee ballots. Sundlun
hoped those ballots would decrease further the margin between
himself and DiPrete.
   ``It was a very close election, and we thought we owed it to the
campaign staff and all the people who worked hard for him,'' Haupt
said. ``We also owed it to Bruce and his piece of mind to make sure
that the vote that was reported on Tuesday was in fact what happened
on Election Day.''
   Absentee ballots from nine communities, including strongly
Democratic Providence, added 143 votes to the unofficial 6,299
margin by which DiPrete led Sundlun.
   The Elections Board had counted about 5,000 of the mailed-in
ballots and expected to finish counting Saturday, said Janet
Armstrong, secretary to the board.
   Sundlun's spokeswoman, Eileen Crochiere, said neither Haupt nor
Sundlun was alleging fraud.
   ``We're pretty realistic that there may be some shifting in the
numbers, but it probably won't change,'' Haupt said.
   DiPrete, who was out of town, had said Wednesday that if he were
in Sundlun's position, he probably would consider asking for a
recount.
   Joseph DiStefano, Elections Board chairman, said any recount
would begin Wednesday and take at least three days.
   The recount entails going to all 1,800 voting machines, opening
the back with representatives from each campaign present, and
comparing the numbers on the meters in the machines with the numbers
reported on sheets filled out by precinct workers, DiStefano said.
   State police are guarding the machines, Ms. Armstrong said.
   Ms. Armstrong said the election results cannot be certified until
after the recount. The last statewide recount was in the 1986
attorney general's race, and did not change the outcome, DiStefano
said.
   With all but one precinct reporting from Tuesday's election,
DiPrete's unofficial machine total was 195,283, or 51 percent, to
Sundlun's 188,984, or 49 percent.

   Canadian rescuers called off their
search Friday for the 27 crewmen missing from a Liberian oil tanker
that broke in half in stormy weather in the north Atlantic.
   The search officially ended as of 1:30 p.m. EST, said John Hughes
of the Canadian Search and Rescue Coordination Center.
   The 65,700-ton Odyssey, with 27 Greek and Honduran crew members
aboard, burst into flames after it broke Thursday and sank about 700
miles east-northeast of Newfoundland and 1,200 miles west of England.
   Hughes said the Canadian military aircraft that flew over the
area Friday morning saw an oil slick about 30 miles by 10 miles. He
said the plane was able to relocate the site of the disaster but the
ship's bow was ``just barely afloat'' and there was no hope of
survivors.
   The Odyssey was carrying crude oil to the refinery at Come by
Chance, Newfoundland. It was operated by Polembros Shipping Ltd. of
London.
   A Soviet weather ship that had been aiding the search remained in
the area but it was expected to leave later Friday.
   ``Based on information we have gleaned from the Russian ship and
the aircraft, the conclusion is there's no chance of survivors,''
said Maj. Bill MacMillan, spokesman for the Search and Rescue
Coordination Center.

   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq recessed Friday
after seven direct sessions produced no tangible progress toward a
permanent peace agreement.
   But in separate negotiations with the International Committee of
the Red Cross both agreed to exchange by Dec. 31 all sick and
wounded prisoners captured during the 8-year-old war.
   Iraq and Iran agreed to resume the negotiations ``in the near
future,'' possibly in December or January, said U.N. mediator Jan
Eliasson.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has urged the two
governments to use the recess for ``deep reflection'' and to take
steps ``to move the peace process forward,'' Eliasson said after the
50-minute meeting.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said the meetings
brought a ``better climate and we do hope that the next round will
achieve practical progress.''
   His Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, said Iraq ``will do its best
to make the next round fruitful. ''
   Contacts will continue with both sides to ensure ``careful
preparations so that the next round will provide us with results,''
Eliasson said.
   Iran and Iraq have reaffirmed their commitment to uphold the
cease-fire and to implement U.N. Resolution 598, which calls for a
comprehensive peace settlement, he said.
   Eliasson gave both sides credit for their ``positive cooperation
with the International Committee of the Red Cross'' in accepting a
Red Cross proposal to begin Nov. 20 with the exchange of 1,569 sick
and wounded prisoners.
   The Red Cross said both sides promised to provide lists of all
other disabled prisoners, who will be repatriated starting Dec. 5.
The program ``must be completed not later than Dec. 31,'' the Red
Cross said in a statement.
   But Eliasson told a news conference that the talks remain stuck
on the ``points of immediate concern,'' listing a provision to
withdraw forces to internationally recognized borders without delay.
   A U.N. report said at some border positions, troops are only
paces apart.
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran blamed the lack of an agreement on
Iraq's continued presence on Iranian soil.
   ``We regard the presence of Iraqi troops in our territory a sign
of war, and if the Iraqi leadership is serious in its quest for
peace, it must remove this sign from our territory,'' Khamenei said
Friday at Tehran University.
   He said no other moves in the negotiations could be accepted
until the troops are withdrawn. His remarks were carried on Tehran
Radio and monitored in Cyprus.
   Iraq has not denied an Iranian claim that Iraqi troops still hold
386 square miles of Iranian territory while no Iranian soldier has
remained on Iraqi soil.
   Iran insists that the withdrawal be based on a 1975 border treaty
which President Saddam Hussein of Iraq ripped up five days before
his divisions moved into Iran in 1980. Iraq says the treaty must be
renegotiated.
   Eliasson said the United Nations presented both sides with
``certain ideas'' regarding the issue but declined to say whether
these were based on the 1975 treaty.
   The atmosphere at the third round, which started Oct. 31, was
described by Eliasson as ``constructive and sober.'' But he made
clear that the climate remained chilly and that both sides generally
refused to speak to each other.
   ``There is a dialogue, one speaks in front of each other,'' he
said, adding that during coffee or tea breaks there are ``occasions
you could detect something that could also be called conversation.''

   The Soviets on Friday were silent about plans for
the maiden flight of their space shuttle Buran despite statements
from a top space official the previous day that an announcement
could be expected.
   ``Tomorrow we'll finish all preliminary experiments with Energia
and Buran,'' Alexander I. Dunaev, director of the Soviet commercial
space agency Glavkosmos, told a news conference Thursday. ``Tomorrow
we'll be able to tell you the exact time of launch.''
   The first attempt at launching the Buran _ which is Russian for
snowstorm _ was scrubbed Oct. 29 at only 51 seconds before blastoff
when a computer sensed that an equipment platform had not pulled far
enough away from Energia, the booster rocket that will carry the
orbiter aloft on its first unmanned mission.
   State-run Radio Moscow reported Tuesday that Buran and Energia
were on the launch pad at the Baikonur space center in Kazakhstan in
Soviet Central Asia, and said the shuttle's launch would take place
in the next few days.

<HEAD>NBC Gets Reprieve As Cosby Signs for Another Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC can heave a sigh of relief _ Bill Cosby has
agreed to keep his top-rated ``The Cosby Show'' on the network for
another season.
   The show, which premiered in 1984, turned Thursday night into a
ratings blockbuster for NBC and made the network, which had never
previously won a season, into the No. 1 network four years in a row.
   NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff said he was
``ecstatic'' about the announcement.
   ```The Cosby Show' has been the symbol of success and quality at
NBC for the past five years,'' Tartikoff said. ``Knowing that it
will return for the 1989-90 season allows an entire company to sleep
better at night.''
   Cosby had always said he would only do the show for five seasons,
which would have made this season its last on the air.
   ``I will work even harder to ensure that people get what I
consider to be quality,'' Cosby said in a statement released
Thursday. ``I love my job and take great pride in doing it.''
   Cosby stars as Heathcliff Huxtable, a Brooklyn obstetrician with
a lawyer wife and a brood of five often exasperating children.
   The sit-com was a hit from its debut on Sept. 17, 1984, and has
been the No. 1-rated prime-time network television show for three
seasons in a row. Only ``All in the Family'' managed the same feat,
ranking first for five years in a row in the early '70s.
   The show won three Emmys in 1985, for best comedy series, writing
and direction. The show has also won a Peabody award, three NAACP
Image awards and a Humanitas award.

   Looking to earn more than $68,000 next year? If
so, here are some possibilities:
   _Special negotiator in the State Department's Bureau of Economic
and Business Affairs.
   _Associate commissioner in the disability office at the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   _Director of the intergovernmental affairs office at the
Education Department.
   These positions and thousands more are contained in an oversized,
230-page manual that Washington insiders call ``The Plum Book,'' a
compilation of political jobs published every four years with the
change of administration.
   The book, formally entitled ``Policy and Supporting Positions,''
is a usually a best-seller. More than 500 copies of the $14 book had
sold Thursday, the day after the manual was put on sale at
bookstores run by the Government Printing Office, GPO spokewoman
Carlyn Crout said.
   The stores were closed Friday, a federal holiday.
   William G. Norton of the Office of Personnel Management said
there are differences between this year's book and the edition that
came out four years ago.
   For one thing, fewer jobs are listed.
   OPM sought to make the book ``a document that is more realistic
and didn't contain a lot of extraneous positions,'' Norton said. As
a result, 8,000 jobs outside the competitive civil service are
listed, compared to 10,000 four years ago.
   Among the slots that were dropped: judgeships that already are
filled.
   The book also came out the day after Vice President George Bush
was elected to the presidency; four years ago job-seekers waited
until February for the book.
   Although the book has about 8,000 jobs, Norton said the Bush
people will only have about 3,000 to 4,000 full-time slots open
because of laws governing the civil service. Also up for grabs on
are about 1,400 positions on presidential boards and commissions
that are generally compensated at a daily rate, he said.
   Civil service laws prohibit politicians from filling all the top
jobs with non-career people.
   For instance, no more than 10 percent of the senior executive
service jobs _ those paying between $68,700 and $80,700 in 1989 _
can be filled by non-career people. So, the book lists all the jobs
available, but only a set number may be taken by people outside the
civil service, Norton said.
   Additionally, the book lists all senior Foreign Service jobs. Yet
non-career people are only allowed to occupy 5 percent of those
positions.
   Bush's transition office opens for business on Monday, but plenty
of people have already submitted resumes. Chase Untermeyer, the man
Bush named as director of personnel for the transition, said
thousands of people had applied for work in the new administration.
   Although the personnel management office compiles the jobs, the
book is printed for the House Committee on Post Office and Civil
Service, which directed agencies to provide descriptions of the
political jobs.

<HEAD>With AM-Reagan-Tax Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Preservationists and historians were
celebrating Friday after President Reagan signed legislation that
included a provision to block construction of a shopping mall next
to a Civil War battlefield in northern Virginia.
   ``We are pleased, grateful, elated, you name it,'' said Annie
Snyder, a Civil War buff who organized the movement to stop the
building project adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
``It's a tremendous victory, and we're awfully relieved.''
   The administration had opposed the proposal to purchase a
540-acre parcel adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park
because of its projected $60 million-plus cost, but the measure was
attached to a bill that Reagan signed amending the sweeping tax
overhaul enacted in 1986.
   Developer John T. Hazel had planned to build a 1.2
million-square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million square feet of office
space and 560 homes on the site, but preservationists complained the
measure would violate the still-rustic sanctity of the 4,200-acre
park where two crucial Civil War battles were fought.
   Reps. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., Mike Andrews, D-Texas, and Frank
Wolf, R-Va., fashioned a plan that called on the government to
acquire the entire development tract, close two heavily traveled
commuter routes running through the battlefield and pay up to $30
million for construction of new roads around the park. The House
overwhelmingly passed the legislation in July.
   However, Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., rejected less-expensive
compromise measures and sponsored a bill identical to the House
version. After Bumpers succeeded in getting the bill through the
Energy and Natural Resources committee he serves on, the measure was
attached to the tax bill passed by the Senate.
   A key to the movement's success was a groundswell of support from
around the country, including more than 80,000 petition signatures
asking Congress to buy the land, Snyder said.
   ``It's been the most incredible grass-roots effort I've ever
seen,'' Snyder said. ``It shows when the people of the nation get
behind something, there's still a way for the little guy to win.''
   The park, west of Washington, D.C., includes the site of the
First and Second Battles of Manassas, also known as Bull Run after a
creek in the area.
   The proposed development site includes a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops in a stunning
victory in the Second Manassas. Historians also have testified that
unmarked graves of Union and Confederate soldiers were scattered
throughout the site.

   Two pit bull terriers were in the custody of
an animal control warden Friday after they attacked and killed a
graduate student who was on his way to a friend's house, authorities
said.
   Kevin B. Cull, 25, of De Kalb, suffered severe bites on his
ankles, legs, hips and arms. He taken to Central Du Page Hospital,
where he died Thursday night, said hospital spokeswoman Trish
Hummell.
   DuPage County Coroner Richard Ballinger speculated the injuries
were sustained shortly before Cull was found and said an inquest was
scheduled.
   Cull was attacked as he was walking up a driveway to visit
friends, police said. After encountering the dogs, Cull apparently
retreated to his car, where he was found by another houseguest.
   The houseguest took Cull to the Kane County Sheriff's Department,
Sheriff F. John Randall said.
   A radio operator at the sheriff's office said he did not know who
owned the dogs or the name of the friend. Authorities said no
arrests had been made.
   The dogs were captured but no decision had been made Friday on
whether to destroy them, officials said.
   Cull was a graduate student in analytical chemistry at Northern
Illinois University.

<HEAD>Ministry Reportedly Tried To Hush Errant U.S. Navy Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy destroyer fired practice missiles
dangerously close to a Japanese coast guard vessel, and the Foreign
Ministry tried to hush up the incident, a Transport Ministry
spokesman said Friday.
   The Foreign Ministry asked a top Transport Ministry official not
to report Wednesday incident, in which the USS Towers fired the
missiles that landed behind the Japanese ship in Japanese
territorial waters, the spokesman said.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman denied his ministry tried to cover
up the incident. By custom, both ministry spokesman spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Japanese news reports quoted the top Transport Ministry official
as saying the incident, which took place outside the destroyer's
designated firing zone, could have violated international law.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman identified the top transport
official quoted in the press reports as Transport Minister Shintaro
Ishihara. But the Transport Ministry spokeman would not identify the
official.
   The Towers was conducting firing drills about 10 miles off the
Boso Peninsula east of Tokyo when it fired the missiles that landed
about 1,000 feet behind the coast guard patrol boat Uraga. No
injuries or damages were reported.
   Practice missiles contain an inert, or dummy, warhead and do not
explode.
   Japan claims territorial waters about 13 miles from shore.
   Some of the 3,230-ton Uraga's 46 crew members reported seeing
15-foot columns of water when the missiles hit.
   A Japanese Defense Agency official told Kyodo News Service that
it ``was like firing a pistol in Ginza,'' a bustling shopping
district in Tokyo.
   The U.S. Navy expressed regret Thursday after the coast guard
complained, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   Adm. Huntington Hardisty, commander of U.S. Pacific forces,
called on Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and Foreign Minister
Sosuke Uno to apologize, the spokesman said.
   He said the Navy is investigating the incident.
   A U.S. military spokesman, Marine Sgt. Jake Rodriguez, said there
would be no comment on the incident before Monday, and U.S.
diplomats were not available because of Veterans Day, a U.S.
national holiday.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman quoted Hardisty as saying he also
regretted stray bullets hitting local residences during military
drills on Okinawa in southwestern Japan, adding that those accidents
were also under investigation.
   U.S. forces on Okinawa have been involved in a series of recent
accidents, including an October fire on a U.S. Marine base that
burned 30 acres of woodland.
   About 46,000 U.S. servicemen are stationed in Japan.

<HEAD>Panda Crowds in Cincinnati Below Projections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The crowds visitng the Cincinnati Zoo to see a
giant panda have not met expectations, and there could be a
shortfall in revenue to for an international program to encourage
panda breeding, officials said.
   The 290-pound Chia Chia arrived in September from the London Zoo.
The 16-year-old male will stay until Nov. 28, when he is to move on
to permanent new quarters at the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City to
take part in a breeding program.
   When the Cincinnati Zoo opened its giant panda exhibit Sept. 3,
officials predicted 500,000 people would visit, bringing in $200,000
to fund a permanent panda home in Mexico and perhaps as much as
$400,000 more for an international panda conservation fund.
   But with 17 days remaining, zoo officials are not sure the
$200,000 has been raised by the 300,000 people who have come to see
Chia Chia.
   ``We're hoping we at least make that,'' zoo executive director Ed
Maruska said.
   Most of the money raised so far from the panda is earmarked for
the Chapultepec Zoo, which has the best record outside pandas'
native China for breeding the animals.
   That would leave little for the conservation fund that is to be
jointly administered by the London and Cincinnati zoos. The fund was
a key point Cincinnati Zoo officials used in winning U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service permission to exhibit Chia Chia.
   The zoo advanced the Chapultepec Zoo $120,000, Maruska said. He
said his zoo will likely pay the additional $80,000 even if revenues
after expenses do not reach that.
   ``I can't speak for the Zoological Society, but I don't see how
we could do anything else,'' Maruska said.

<TEXT>
   Current and former prison inmates have sued
the Texas Department of Corrections, claiming some prison work
details forced them to handle asbestos without protective equipment.
   The suit, filed this week in Travis County district court by 23
current and seven former prisoners, said the inmates breathed
asbestos particles and the substance ``became packed in (their)
noses, mouths, eyes and hair.''
   The inmates, seeking unspecified damages, claim the department
violated their civil rights and was negligent.
   Lung tests have been performed on some inmates, and ``the records
reflect that the tests are given because of exposure to asbestos,''
the suit said. It didn't say whether the inmates developed
asbestos-related illness.
   TDC spokesman David Nunnelee said, ``I'm not going to respond to
any of that while this is in litigation.''
   Emily Young, a Dallas lawyer handling the suit, said the inmates
contacted her, but she declined to comment further.
   The lawsuit said the inmates were ordered to remove asbestos
insulation with their bare hands and without breathing devices or
other protective equipment.
   ``The asbestos was then thrown on the floor, and broomswept, dry,
by other inmates,'' the lawsuit said. ``The sweeping of the dry
asbestos fibers would cause the previously airborne asbestos fibers
to again become airborne.''
   The inmates stuffed the insulation into garbage bags that were
thrown into pickups, the suit said. Then, it said, ``prison guards
ordered one or more inmates to physically search through the bags,
completely unprotected, for inmates who might be trying to escape.''

   Two astronauts who flew aboard the space
shuttle Discovery returned to their home state Friday to the cheers
of hundreds of flag-waving parents and children.
   A high school band struck up the national anthem while George
``Pinky'' Nelson and David Hilmers stood at attention on a flatbed
truck bearing a sign, ``Welcome Heroes. The Pride of Clinton
County.''
   ``Thank you for playing the national anthem,'' Hilmers said.
``Ever since the mission, hearing the national anthem gives me a
particular sense of emotion.''
   Hilmers said he felt anxious on the launch pad moments before the
Sept. 29 liftoff, but thoughts of home calmed him.
   ``I knew back here in Clinton County that many prayers were going
up with us,'' he said. ``It made the launch much, much easier.''
   The successful Discovery mission revived the U.S. space shuttle
program, which had grounded since the Challenger exploded on Jan.
28, 1986, killing its seven crew members.
   Nelson, 38, born in Charles City, and Hilmers, who was born in
Clinton but reared in DeWitt, were greeted by an enthusiastic crowd
of people craning necks and pointing fingers as the airplane
carrying the astronauts landed at the tiny airport here.
   ``Those two men are real heroes who were willing to go up in
space after that tragic Challenger accident,'' said Paul Eastland,
73, of Clinton. ``We're all pround of them.''
   Behind Eastland stood Betty and Joe Soletski of De Witt.
   ``All of them are really special _ they have to be to take that
job,'' Mrs. Soletski said.
   ``If I was young enough, I'd like to go. I'd love to go on one of
those shuttle trips,'' her husband said. ``I think that's where our
future lies anyway.''
   Later at a school, the astronauts recounted their experiences in
space. They also told students not to forget Veterans Day.
   ``What Veterans Day is to me is that it means there are things in
life far more important than life itself,'' Hilmers said. ``There
were people who felt their country was important enough that they
risked their lives for it.''
   ``Pinky and I, we felt returning the nation to space was a goal
worth risking our lives for,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A judge cleared a convenience store clerk of
disorderly conduct for serving an oversalted ham sandwich _ a
practical joke that a trooper with high blood pressure found in bad
taste.
   Trooper William Cruz testified Thursday that although ham is
naturally salty, he is a ``picky eater'' and knew that salt had been
added to the hoagie state Trooper Barry Gaston picked up for him at
a 7-Eleven store on July 24.
   Cruz's supervisor, Cpl. Joseph Fuentes, said he tasted the
sandwich and assigned Gaston to investigate. Store clerk David
Uriarte, 16, and Paul Newmayer, 21, of Ottsville, were charged
shortly afterward.
   Fuentes noted at the time that Cruz's high blood pressure could
be aggravated by salt, and said the charge was a message to
pranksters not to mess with troopers' food. But Ferndale District
Justice Elizabeth Leonard acquitted the teen-ager after a 2{-hour
trial, and even the local prosecutor belitted the troopers' bid for
no-salt assurance.
   ``They must not have had anything to do that day,'' Bucks County
District Attorney Alan Rubenstein said of the decision to
investigate.
   Newmayer was convicted earlier of disorderly conduct, which is
punishable by up to a $300 fine. He testified that while waiting at
the 7-Eleven to meet some friends, he put extra salt on the
ham-and-cheese hoagie. He said Uriarte was ``in'' on the practical
joke, but Uriarte denied any part in the tampering.
   Rubenstein said he considered the charges so ridiculous he would
not prosecute the case if Newmayer's conviction got to the Common
Pleas Court level on appeal.
   ``If messing up food were a criminal offense, my mother-in-law
would be in jail,'' Rubenstein told the Philadelphia Daily News.

<TEXT>
   The Voyager 2 spacecraft, flying through
space 2.6 billion miles from Earth, fired its thrusters Friday to
change course for its August 1989 picture-taking encounter with the
planet Neptune, NASA said.
   ``Responding to radio signals radioed from Earth, Voyager 2 fired
its hydrazine thrusters for three minutes and 29 seconds beginning
at 6:55 a.m. PST,'' said a statement issued by the space agency's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Flight engineering manager Lanny Miller said radio signals sent
to Earth by the space probe indicated the maneuver succeeded.
   The pre-planned course correction will bring Voyager 2 some 6,200
miles closer to the solar system's eighth planet, but another major
maneuver next April and several subsequent but minor trajectory
changes will be required before the Neptune flyby, said laboratory
spokeswoman Mary Beth Murrill.
   The spacecraft _ which passed by Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981
and Uranus in 1986 _ is scheduled to sweep within 3,000 miles of
Neptune's cloud tops at 9 p.m. PDT next Aug. 24, taking pictures
with its television camera.
   Five hours later, it will fly within 24,000 miles of Neptune's
moon Triton, which scientists believe may have lakes of liquid
nitrogen.
   Murrill said Voyager 2 is 414.7 million miles from Neptune, one
of the solar system's giant, gaseous outer planets.
   Radio commands to the probe and its response signals are
transmitted through large, dish-shaped radio antennae that make up
the Deep Space Network operated by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration in Spain, Australia and Goldstone, Calif.
   Voyager 2 is so far away that the signals take four hours to
reach it, even traveling at the speed of light.
   The Neptune encounter will be the last of the so-called ``grand
tour'' of the outer planets by the Voyager probes. Voyagers 1 and 2
were launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in 1977. Voyager 1, which
visited Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, now is headed out of the
solar system.
   Scientists have called the Voyager mission humanity's most
productive space exploration effort because the two picture-taking
probes learned hundreds of times more about the outer planets than
all previous studies combined.
   NASA scientists have said that by 1995, when both probes are
searching for the edge of the solar system, the total cost of the
mission will be about $920 million, which is less than half what the
Pentagon spends during one workday.
   Among key Voyager discoveries were active volcanos spewing sulfur
on Jupiter's moon Io, an icy volcanism that produced glacier-like
flows on some of the Saturnian and Uranian moons, and the discovery
of at least 17 previously unknown moons: three at Jupiter, at least
four at Saturn and 10 orbiting Uranus.
   The probes also discovered new rings encircling Jupiter, Saturn
and Uranus; orange smog and ethane-methane rain on Saturn's moon
Titan, and dozens of giant hurricanes on Jupiter.

   The crab fleet is returning with empty pots
this week, suggesting crabs are scarce along the coast near San
Francisco.
   Last year, the catch came to a little more than 3 million pounds
in the coastal region between Half Moon Bay and Bodega Bay. That was
the biggest catch since 1959-60.
   The catch in the 1950s generally ran about 4 million pounds, but
fell to 400,000 pounds or less by the late 1960s. It jumped back in
1986-87 to 1.6 million pounds.
   This year's season opened Tuesday, but most boats stayed in to
allow crew members time to vote. The weather was bad Wednesday, but
by Thursday, it became evident that crabs were scarce.
   ``It's not even an eighth of what the boats got last year,'' said
Joe Cincotta, manager of the Alioto Fish Co. ``Last year, they got
eight to 12 crabs per pot. Today, it was two or three.''
   Phil Swartzell of the state Department of Fish and Game said the
marketing agreement set a price of $1.50 a pound.

   An animal-rights activist was arrested
Friday on charges she planted a radio-controlled pipe bomb in an
apparent attempt to kill the head of a company that experiments on
dogs, police said.
   Fran Stephanie Trutt, 33, of New Hyde Park, N.Y., was captured
shortly after midnight as she left the grounds of U.S. Surgical
Corp., police said.
   ``Ms. Trutt is a self-styled member of several animal rights
groups and considers the policies of U.S. Surgical to be an affront
to animal rights,'' said police Lt. Jeff Finch.
   She was charged with attempted murder, possession of explosives
and manufacturing a bomb, and was being held under $500,000 bond
pending an appearance Monday in Norwalk Superior Court, police said.
   Police had staked out the company, which produces surgical
stapling devices, after receiving information that it might be the
target of violence, Finch said.
   Officers saw Trutt enter the grounds with a package and leave it
in some bushes about 10 feet from Chairman Leon Hirsch's vacant
parking space, Finch said.
   Trutt was carrying a radio-controlled detonator for the bomb when
she was arrested, he said. Finch initially said Trutt planned to
explode the bomb as Hirsch walked into building, but he said later
he didn't know when she planned to explode the bomb or whether
Hirsch was definitely the target.
   He described the device as a ``sophisticated bomb capable of
killing anyone near it.'' A Stamford police bomb squad removed it.
   About 200 people were working in the plant overnight, Hirsch said.
   The potential loss of life made the incident the most serious of
more than 100 animal rights actions, including break-ins, vandalism
and demonstrations, over the past decade, said Frankie Trull,
president of the Washington, D.C.-based Foundation for Biomedical
Research. The most serious previous incident was a $3.5 million
arson at the University of California at Davis in 1987, Trull said.
   The FBI is investigating for possible federal charges, including
terrorism, police said.
   U.S. Surgical, which employs 2,600 people nationwide, conducts
experiments on about 1,000 animals, mostly dogs, a year, Hirsch
said. The animals, which are obtained from U.S. Department of
Agriculture farms, are destroyed after experiments, he said.
   State health officials last month upheld the company's use of
anesthetized live dogs to demonstrate its equipment for surgical
stapling, a process that replaces stitches to close wounds and
incisions.
   The New York-based Fund for Animals, which had filed the
complaint over the dog experiments, said it had no connection with
Trutt.
   ``We were horrified to learn of this,'' said Julie Lewin, the
organization's Connecticut coordinator. ``We in no way condone any
terrorism. Violence toward people does not help animals.''
   Hirsch said he had never spoken to or received letters from Trutt.
   ``I think what we and other companies should be doing is telling
the world what these animal activists are really like,'' Hirsch said.
   ``The public thinks they're a wonderful group of little old
ladies, protecting puppies and pound dogs,'' he said. ``But nothing
could be further from the truth. These are hard-core animal
extremists who believe the rights of animals supercede the rights of
humans.''

   An explosion crippled almost half the
presses at a company that publishes magazines for newspapers around
the country, but its president said Friday that production demands
will be met.
   ``We will handle all of our customers needs through industry
support and off-loading of business to other people in our
industry,'' said Michael Shea, president of Standard Gravure Corp.
   The explosion Thursday night ripped through the huge plant,
injuring 20 people and forcing the evacuation of an adjacent
building that houses Kentucky's largest newspaper.
   Shea said three of the plant's seven presses were damaged in the
blast and two fires which preceded it.
   Standard Gravure publishes Parade magazine as well as magazines
for newspapers in Dallas, Detroit, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. The
company also prints Sunday newspaper inserts and catalogs and
distributes to all 50 states.
   Shea could not estimate the amount of the damage, but on
Thursday, company spokesman Jack Uhl said the loss would be
``substantial.'' One or more of the $10 million presses may have to
be substantially rebuilt, Uhl said. The company is insured.
   The next two weeks would be critical, Shea said. ``We don't know
how much longer it might take to get back into total operation. He
said he hoped to have the four undamaged presses running by late
Friday.
   The plant, which employs about 475 people, was open Friday, and
Shea said workers would continue to ``come to work for the immediate
future.''
   Employees received a memo Friday detailing the events of Thursday
night.
   Eighteen of the injured were firefighters, many of whom were
blown off their feet by the force of the explosion at about 7:25
p.m. Of the seven who remained hospitalized Friday in Humana
Hospital-University of Louisville, four were listed in fair
condition; two in the burn unit were listed in fair condition, and
one in the critical care unit was in stable condition, a spokeswoman
said.
   Officials said most of the firefighters suffered burns on their
faces and hands, and one suffered a fractured skull.
   Two Standard Gravure employees were listed in stable condition at
Methodist Evangelical Hospital, also suffering burns on their faces
and hands.
   The Courier-Journal, housed in an adjacent building, published an
eight-page edition that was limited in circulation to the metro
Louisville area. Some of the newspapers were printed at the
Lexington Herald-Leader under an emergency agreement, while the rest
came off the Courier's home presses.

   George Bush, on vacation in Florida
under the watchful eye of the Secret Service, stood on the deck of a
Coast Guard cutter Friday, ready to jump a dozen feet into the brisk
Atlantic waters.
   This reporter accepted an unexpected invitation and followed him
in.
   President-elect and Barbara Bush flew to nearby Palm Beach
Thursday for four days' rest and relaxation while aides in
Washington started up a bureaucracy to guide his transition to
office.
   Three aides and a full Secret Service contingent came along, as
well as a few reporters.
   Bush spent the morning sitting by the swimming pool at the
oceanside home where he is resting a few days before concentrating
on putting together his new administration. He sat beside the pool
Friday morning and chatted on the phone with the likes of Richard
Nixon and Sen. Robert Byrd.
   Bush indicated he was still keyed up after the election. ``I
haven't really gotten down to the bottom of the unwinding yet,'' he
acknowledged.
   The president-elect went out for a mid-day jog around a golf
course near the vacation home of William Stamps Farish III, a friend
and host to the Bushes. Bush had a gaggle of Secret Service agents
running with him. I too had been jogging in the neighborhood and he
stopped to chat.
   The president-elect and Mrs. Bush were going swimming with their
hosts.
   ``Hey, can she go in the water with us?'' Bush asked his aides
and agents, pointing in my direction.
   No problem.
   Bush was cheery and upbeat, joking with his companions as he led
the group down the beach. Offshore the Coast Guard cutter Point
Barnes patrolled.
   The Bushes boarded a motorized raft for a ride out to the cutter.
It then returned to pick up the others.
   Barbara Bush was first in the water.
   The president-elect peeled off his T-shirt and jumped off the
side.
   About 100 yards out from the cutter, the president-elect called
to agents and aides in a motorized raft to toss back a rope.
   ``Rev it up,'' the soon-to-be commander-in-chief ordered as we
grabbed the rope line, struggling to keep our heads above water as
they towed us to shore. Mrs. Bush, an avid swimmer, swam the full
400 yards on her own power.
   On shore, Bush aides offered towels and a jacket.
   After the swim, president-elect Bush walked to the Farish house
and gestured toward a sunny courtyard with a swimming pool.
   ``That's where I was all morning, talking on the phone,'' he
said. ``So you can tell them how we're roughing it.''
   There had been congratulatory telephone calls to return: Former
President Nixon, Senate Majority Leader Byrd, South Carolina Gov.
Carroll Campbell, Illinois Gov. James Thompson, New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean, among others.
   Bush said a few of them offered advice, but he didn't elaborate.
   Most of the work was being done at his transition office in
Washington, and even there some of the staffers were taking the
Veterans Day holiday off, he said.
   In a playful mood, Bush emerged from the Atlantic after Mrs. Bush
had walked up on shore and stood in the shallow surf snapping photos
of her and others on the beach with a camera he grabbed from his
official photographer, David Valdez.
   The Farishs' cheery yellow house seemed less extravagant than
many along the exclusive beachfront where sunbathers and joggers
enjoyed the shore and sailboats bounced on the sea.

   The Air Force had completed safety inspections
of nearly half of its B-1B bombers by late Friday in the effort to
return the grounded fleet to flight status in the wake of a crash in
Texas.
   Two days after the fleet was grounded following Tuesday's crash
near Abilene, Texas, 48 of the 98 long-range bombers had passed the
mandatory inspections, said Capt. Julie Holland, a spokeswoman for
the Strategic Air Command in Omaha, Neb. She said no further
announcement would be made until next week.
   The check-ups, which require about three hours per plane, were
going smoothly, she added.
   The bombers were grounded Wednesday, one day after a B-1B crashed
and burned near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, outside Abilene. The
crew of four managed to eject safety.
   The plane was the second B-1B to be lost in 14 months.
   There has been no official comment on the cause of Tuesday's
accident, although witnesses reported seeing fire around the plane's
left two engines before the crash. The grounding order specified a
mandatory inspection of electric, fuel and hydraulic fluid lines.
   SAC, which is responsible for land-based nuclear bomber and
missile forces, has described the grounding and inspection order as
a ``normal precaution'' in the wake of a major accident.
   The bombers have been deployed at Dyess; Ellsworth AFB, S.D.;
Grand Forks AFB, N.D., and McConnell AFB, Kan.
   According to Holland, 16 B-1B's at Dyess have so far been
inspected; 5 at Ellsworth; 13 at McConnell, and 8 at Grand Forks.
   The four-engine, swing-wing B-1B is designed to fill the gap
between the aging fleet of B-52 bombers and the new B-2 ``Stealth''
bomber, the first of which is to be unveiled later this month.
   The B-1B, built by Rockwell International Corp., has a maximum
speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega accused the
Reagan administration Friday of sabotaging a meeting of Central
American leaders and renewed his call for a peace zone in the region.
   ``What impedes these talks ... are the American policies, the
American pressures that do not rule out a solution by force,'' the
president said to a group of politicians and lawmakers from
Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and El Salvador, all of which are
U.S. allies.
   Central American presidents had considered meeting later this
month about the peace plan they signed Aug. 7, 1987. The pact,
written by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, seeks to end wars in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Nicaragua's official Radio Sandino reported Friday that Ortega
asked the National Assembly to extend a 30-day state of emergency
imposed Oct. 20, two days before Hurricane Joan struck. An emergency
in effect since 1982 was lifted last January to comply with the
regional peace plan.
   The United States backs the Nicaragua rebels, known as Contras,
in their 7-year-old war to oust the leftist Sandinista government.
   Ortega sharply criticized the United States for interfering in
the affairs of the Central American nations.
   ``The attitude of the American government tries to condition aid,
tries to say to the Central American governments, `here is what we
will do and how we will do it,' (and) interfere in decisions taken
within the constitutional mark,'' Ortega said.
   The United States cut off aid to the Sandinistas in 1981, almost
two years after they took power in a 1979 revolutionary war.
President Reagan on Thursday renewed a trade embargo started in 1985.
   The Sandinista president called on the nations in the region to
unite ``to convert Central American into a zone of peace, a neutral
zone, free of all foreign military presence.''
   Foreign military advisers from the Soviet bloc, especially Cuba,
are in Nicaragua. U.S. troops or military representatives are in the
other four nations.
   Ortega called on Central American nations to work ``to contain
the growth of arms and look for a rational balance of force.''
   Nicaragua's neighbors, especially Honduras and El Salvador, say
that the Sandinista government threatens the region by maintaining
300,000 people under arms, including the armed forces, militia and
reserves.
   The Managua meeting, sponsored by the European Economic
Community, was held to discuss the formation of a Central American
parliament.

<HEAD>Poll Says Most Canadians Oppose New U.S. Trade Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll published Friday says 51 percent of
Canadians oppose the free trade agreement with the United States,
which is to become effective Jan. 1 and has come to dominate the
current political campaign.
   The trade pact is safe only if Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who
signed it with President Reagan last January, and his Conservatives
win a parliamentary majority in the Nov. 21 elections.
   The Environics Research Group poll published by the Toronto Globe
and Mail newspaper indicated 51 percent of 1,275 eligible voters
polled Nov. 3-8 oppose the agreement, an increase of 9 percent since
the election campaign began last month.
   It said 39 percent of those querried supported the pact and the
rest were undecided. The margin of error was 2.7 percent.
   An Environics poll at the campaign's outset showed 44 percent in
favor and 42 against the trade pact.
   The latest poll also found 44 percent of Canadians would rather
renegotiate the agreement than tear it up.
   Both John Turner's Liberal Party and the socialist New Democratic
Party led by Ed Broadbent oppose the agreement and the Liberals have
made spectacular gains in opinion polls.
   A poll published Thursday, also by Environics, showed 37 percent
of those questioned supporting the Liberals, 35 for the
Conservatives and 24 for the New Democrats.
   Most analysts believed when the campaign began that Mulroney
would win a majority and some predictions put the Liberals in third
place, which would have been a dismal showing for such a dominant
force in Canadian politics.
   The U.S.-Canada pact eliminates tariffs and reduces other
barriers in nearly every facet of the $150 billion annual trading
partnership, phasing in the changes over 10 years. The U.S. Senate
approved the agreement 83-9 in September but it still needs final
approval from Parliament.
   Mulroney says it is necessary to guarantee Canadian access to the
vital U.S. market despite growing protectionism below the border,
and argues that the pact will create jobs and promote future
prosperity.
   Opponents contend Canada is outweighed in the agreement by the
greater size and economic clout of the United States. They also say
it may affect Canada's strong social and health care programs.
Mulroney dismisses those contentions as false ``scare mongering.''

   Members of the ruling Politburo flew to the restive
Baltic republics Friday, and one warned residents against pushing
too hard for economic and cultural autonomy from Moscow, local
journalists reported.
   Dissatisfaction in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has been fueled
by political reforms proposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Baltic residents say the changes will void their constitutional
right to secede and give Moscow control over their economy and other
aspects of life.
   The Politburo, the Communist Party's supreme body, promised
Thursday to hold a discussion on expanding the rights of the 15
constituent Soviet republics. But the dispatching of three of its
members to the Baltic region indicated the Kremlin wants to draw the
line now on what sort of political changes can be contemplated.
   The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet parliament is to meet in special
session in Moscow on Nov. 29 to approve Gorbachev's blueprint for
political change, which also increases the powers of the
presidential post and creates a new national legislature.
   Viktor M. Chebrikov, the former KGB chief who now heads a party
Central Committee commission on legal and judicial reform, opposed
demands for local economic independence in comments to workers at a
plastics factory in Tallinn, Estonia, according to Tarmu Tammerk, an
Estonian journalist.
   ``He said very strong words against economic independence. He
said the whole of the Soviet economy is so tightly linked that one
cannot speak of independence for one of its parts,'' Tammerk, who
works for the newspaper Homeland, said in a telephone interview.
   Chebrikov's remarks were broadcast on state-run Estonian radio in
an attempt to give them the widest possible exposure.
   ``His words sounded like a grim warning to people here,'' Tammerk
said.
   ``Economic Independence'' has been the watchword of a widespread
movement in Estonia called the Popular Front, which seeks greater
control by Estonians over the affairs of their Switzerland-sized
republic.
   Estonians say the fruits of their labor are siphoned off by
Moscow to subsidize poorer regions of the country, including the
giant Russian federation, the largest Soviet republic.
   Two of Chebrikov's colleagues on the Politburo traveled to the
other Baltic states, ideology chief Vadim M. Medvedev to Latvia and
Nikolai N. Slyunkov, who is in charge of formulating the party's
social and economic policy, to Lithuania.
   Their arrivals were reported by state-run media in the Baltic
republics, journalists there said.
   Later, the evening television news program Vremya broadcast brief
reports on the visits. Tass, the official news agency, said Medvedev
outlined limits to political activity in meetings with workers at
two factories in Riga, the Latvian capital.
   Tass said Latvians agreed with Medvedev on the need ``to
subordinate group ambitions to the interests of society as a whole
in the conditions of perestroika.''
   However, during his visit to the Norma factory in Tallinn,
Chebrikov heard Estonians object to elements of Gorbachev's
political reform plan, Vremya said.
   The westward-looking Baltic republics, independent states until
the Soviet Union absorbed them in 1940, have become a proving ground
for bold economic reforms that are part of Gorbachev's drive for
``perestroika'' or restructuring.
   Granting a greater degree of autonomy to the small republics on
the Soviet Union's western edge is fraught with political risks,
since many residents resent Moscow's control and some openly say
their ultimate desire is complete independence.
   The Estonian Popular Front and a similar organization in Latvia
have condemned Gorbachev's political reform plan, which is embodied
in proposed amendments to the 1977 Constitution. The Lithuanian
Restructuring Movement is to meet Sunday in Vilnius, the republic's
capital, to consider the issue.
   Members of the three popular fronts are now gathering signatures
on petitions asking that the amendments be dropped and rewritten,
Algimontas Vaishnoras of the Lithuanian group said in a telephone
interview.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, has scheduled a
meeting on the political reform issue for Wednesday, and Lithuania's
legislature will meet the next day.
   The 12-man Politburo, in a report on its Thursday night meeting,
said authorities will consider changing the draft constitutional
changes in response to more than 80,000 suggestions and comments
from citizens and organizations.
   Friday night the Central Committee announced it would hold a
special plenary meeting in mid-1989 to review policies dealing with
the country's more than 100 ethnic groups.
   ``The task of perfecting relations among nationalities is
acquiring special importance and urgency,'' a Central Committee
statement said according to Tass.

southern Italy, officials said.
   They said a member of the kidnap gang who had been holding the

   Two North Carolinians detained by Laotian
authorities on Oct. 2 while on a prisoner of war rescue mission are
expected to be released soon, a State Department official said
Friday.
   Donna Long, of Jacksonville, and James Copp, of Hampstead, were
taken into custody while distributing leaflets advertising a $2.4
million reward for the return of a living American prisoner from the
Indochina war.
   Donald Stader, a State Department official responsible for
Southeast Asia, said in a telephone interview Laotian authorities
agreed to release the pair in return for $1,500 in administrative
costs.
   That sum was based on a judicial proceeding in Vientiane, the
Laotian capital where Ms. Long and Copp were taken after they were
detained in a remote area of the country, Stadler said.
   Another condition imposed by the Laotians, Stader said, was that
a U.S. veterans group cancel a demonstration it had planned for the
Laotian Embassy in Washington on Friday to protest the detention of
Ms. Long and Copp.
   After being advised of the Laotian conditions, the National
Steering Committee for American Vietnam War Veterans canceled the
protest and turned over the $1,500 fee to Stader. Laotian
authorities subsequently were notified that both their demands had
been met.
   Stader said he was not aware of any further obstacles to the
release of the Americans. Both have been well treated, he said.
   Copp and Ms. Long reportedly were aboard a boat that floated to
the Lao side of the Mekong River when they were detained. They were
said to be attempting to float packets containing reward notices
written on U.S. dollar bills and other paper currency. The river
borders on or cuts through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam _ where a
combined total of about 2,400 Americans are unaccounted for.
   After the Americans were detained, State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said private efforts to obtain information about
missing Americans are counterproductive.
   ``We understand the motives behind this kind of effort,'' Redman
said. ``But our view is that this could jeopardize ongoing U.S.-Lao
cooperation to resolve the POW-MIA issue.
   ``We also are concerned that any reward reinforces the perception
widely held in Indochina, particularly among refugees, that
information and remains are items of barter.''
   The spokesman said there is no evidence that the previous
attempts to obtain information about American POW's through the
offer of rewards has produced positive results.

   The final, unofficial tally showed 111,157 votes for Smith and
110,487 for Kopetski, a state representative.
   The election hinged on some 20,000 absentee and previously
uncounted ballots in Clackamas County.
   The margin of victory was great enough to avoid an automatic
recount.
   Recounts are automatic if the victory margin is less than
one-fifth of 1 percent of the total votes cast.
   Smith's re-election leaves the House with 174 Republicans and 259
Democrats. Two races, one in Florida and one in New York, remained
too close to call, but Democrats held narrow leads in both contests.

   President-elect George Bush relaxed
under the Florida sun on Friday, chatting on the phone at poolside
with Richard Nixon and Sen. Robert Byrd, and getting some exercise
by running and swimming.
   Bush indicated he was still keyed up after the election. ``I
haven't really gotten down to the bottom of the unwinding yet,'' he
told The Associated Press.
   The president-elect and his wife Barbara flew to nearby Palm
Beach on Thursday for four days' rest and relaxation while aides in
Washington started up a bureaucracy to guide his transition to
office.
   Three aides and a full Secret Service contingent came along.
   Bush spent the morning sitting by the swimming pool at the
oceanside home where he is resting a few days before concentrating
on putting together his new administration.
   He said there had been congratulatory conversations with former
President Nixon, Senate Majority Leader Byrd, South Carolina Gov.
Carroll Campbell, Illinois Gov. James Thompson and New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean, among others.
   Bush said a few of them offered advice, but he didn't elaborate.
   The president-elect went out for a mid-day jog around a golf
course near the vacation home of William Stamps Farish III, a friend
and host to the Bushes. Bush had a gaggle of Secret Service agents
running with him.
   The president-elect then went swimming with Mrs. Bush and their
hosts. A reporter was invited along.
   Bush was cheery and upbeat, joking with his companions as he led
the group down the beach. Offshore the Coast Guard cutter Point
Barnes patrolled.
   The Bushes boarded a motorized raft for a ride out to the cutter.
It then returned to pick up the others.
   Barbara Bush was first in the water, then the vice president.
   About 100 yards out from the cutter, the president-elect called
to agents and aides in a motorized raft to toss back a rope.
   ``Rev it up,'' the soon-to-be commander-in-chief ordered as he
grabbed the rope line, struggling to keep his head above water as
they towed him to shore. Mrs. Bush, an avid swimmer, swam the full
400 yards on her own power.
   After the swim, president-elect Bush walked to the Farish house
and gestured toward a sunny courtyard with a swimming pool.
   ``That's where I was all morning, talking on the phone,'' he
said. ``So you can tell them how we're roughing it.''
   Most of the work was being done at his transition office in
Washington, and even there some of the staffers were taking the
Veterans Day holiday off, he said.
   In a playful mood, Bush emerged from the Atlantic after Mrs. Bush
had walked up on shore and stood in the shallow surf snapping photos
of her and others on the beach with a camera he grabbed from his
official photographer, David Valdez.

<TEXT>
   An appeals court upheld on Friday the conviction of
terrorist Abu Nidal and two other Palestinian guerrillas for a 1985
Rome airport attack in which 16 people were killed, television
stations reported.
   The Rome Court of Appeals confirmed life sentences imposed in
February on Abu Nidal and Rashid el-Hamieda, described as a top
lieutenant, and the 30-year sentence given Mahmoud Ibrahim Khaled.
Only Khaled is in custody.
   More than 80 people were wounded in assaults with grenades and
automatic weapons on the check-in counters of TWA and the Israeli
airline El Al at Leonardo da Vinci airport the morning of Dec. 27,
1985.
   Four Americans were among the dead, including an 11-year-old
girl. A nearly simultaneous attack at the Vienna airport cost four
lives, including those of two terrorists, and 47 people were wounded.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry al-Banna, and Hamieda were
accused of organizing the Rome airport attack.
   All three men were convicted of massacre and illegal arms
possession. Khaled could be released on parole in about 14 years.
   Abu Nidal's group, called the Fatah Revolutionary Council, has
been blamed since 1972 for more than 100 attacks in Europe, Asia and
the Middle East. He split with Palestine Liberation Organization
chief Yasser Arafat in 1973.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell Friday in the Rocky Mountains, dumping 10 inches on
Summitville in southern Colorado and whitening the ski slopes at
Alta, Utah, with 6 inches.
   Most of the nation had dry, seasonably cool weather, but showers
and thunderstorms struck northern Texas and southern Oklahoma, and
there was rain at the lower elevations of Colorado and northwestern
New Mexico.
   A snow advisory was in effect for the mountains of Colorado and
south-central mountains of Wyoming, where 4 to 6 more inches of snow
was expected at elevations above 8,000 feet.
   The storm, one of several from the Pacific that have brought snow
to the Colorado mountains this week, was accompanied by winds that
at times reduced visibility and made driving hazardous on mountain
passes.
   The Colorado Avalanche Information Center said the recent
snowstorms already have raised the snowpack in the northern Colorado
mountains to 2 to 3 feet, with drifts of 4 to 5 feet above
timberline.
   Brisk southeastery winds accompanied the dry air across much of
the central United States, while blustery northwest winds blew
across New England. Gale warnings continued in effect along the
coast of Washington and Oregon.
   The Southeast and Southwest enjoyed sunny skies with temperatures
in the 60s and 70s. In the North, temperatures rose only into the
30s in the upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes region and
reached the 40s in the northern Plains. Southern Florida and extreme
southern Texas warmed into 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 26
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 88 degrees at Harlingen, Texas.
   The low for the nation early Friday was 16 degrees at Mason City,
Spencer and Waterloo, all in Iowa.
   Lights in the sky over Vermont early Friday were believed to have
been one of two families of meteorites that are visible during the
middle of November.
   It was 48 years ago on Nov. 11 that a blizzard struck the Great
Lakes and upper Midwest, killing more than 154 people, including 59
dead in shipwrecks on Lake Michigan. Up to 17 inches of snow fell in
Iowa, where thousands of cattle died, and whole towns were isolated
by huge snowdrifts.
   For Saturday, the National Weather Service forecast called for
showers and thunderstorms from central Texas and eastern Oklahoma
across the Tennessee Valley and the central Gulf Coast states; rain
from the middle and upper Mississippi Valley across the Ohio Valley
and the Great Lakes region, with snow near Lake Superior. In the
West, rain was forecast from the northern and central Pacific coast
across the northern half of the Plateau. Fair to partly sunny skies
were expected elsewhere.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 40s across most of the
northern United States, but with highs only in the upper 30s from
Minnesota to upper Michigan and in northern Maine; above 70 from
Southern California through much of Texas to Florida and southern
Georgia, with highs in the 80s in south-central Texas and the
Florida peninsula; in the 50s and 60s elsewhere.

<HEAD>TV Station Fires Anchorwoman Who Liked to `Sneak' Jesus into News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anchorwoman was fired after she wrote
in a Christian magazine that religious considerations figured into
her news judgments.
   ``Naturally, I have to lead with the hard news stories that
affect our neighborhood and world ... but it's such a thrill to also
have the power to `sneak' Jesus into the news as often as
possible,'' KDLT-TV weekend anchor Marilee Joyce wrote.
   On numerous occasions she used her position to prevent broadcast
of network stories that she said were of ``questionable nature,''
she wrote in Good News, a magazine published by TEAM Television, a
Christian cable television station.
   These included series on the New Age movement and on the Hare
Krishna religion. ``I decided it would not be good to fill our
viewers' minds with such information, so I didn't permit the stories
to air,'' Joyce wrote.
   Steven Herman, KDLT president and general manager, said Joyce was
fired Tuesday for ``an error in journalistic judgment,'' reflected
in the article headlined ``A Different Type of TV Evangelism.''
   ``I don't want to make it a public issue,'' Herman said Thursday.
``I don't think it's in her best interest to battle out in the press
what's really a personal, private decision between Marilee Joyce and
myself.''
   Joyce, 25, worked as an anchor, reporter and producer at the NBC
affiliate since April, and on weekends she was responsible for
deciding which stories were broadcast. She said she was devastated
at being fired.
   ``I am a news professional and I conducted myself in that
manner,'' she said. ``I have been precautioned by my advisers not to
say anything further.''
   In the article, Joyce criticized television producers for their
reluctance to broadcast ``good news'' stories, and she criticized
viewers for their appetite for ``bad news.''
   Joyce also described how she assigned several stories with
religious angles, including an interview with a local Christian
author and a story on a anti-abortion agency.

<HEAD>Says Two Jetliners Narrowly Missed Collision at Toronto Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two jetliners carrying 201 people on domestic
flights came within 1,700 feet of colliding after taking off from
Toronto's Pearson International Airport, the Toronto Star reported
Friday.
   It said one plane went into a dive to avoid the other in the
incident Sunday. No injuries were rported.
   Denis Begin, an investigator for the Canadian Aviation Safety
Board, was quoted by the newspaper as saying the planes should have
been at least 3.1 miles apart with 990 feet between altitude levels.
The Star said the two planes came as close as 1,700 feet and one was
flying at a level only 98 feet above the other.
   Near misses are not routinely reported in Canada and the Star
said it learned of the incident through a passenger who called to
report it.
   It said the incident involved a Canadian Airlines Boeing 737 with
90 people on board that was leaving for Montreal and a Wardair
Airbus 310 with 111 people that was headed for Ottawa.
   Passenger Tom Nelson, a Toronto electronics engineer who was on
the Canadian Airlines flight, told the Star that the plane dropped
suddenly.
   ``It was a very abrupt action. Then we saw the flashing lights
from the other plane go by. We just couldn't believe our eyes,'' he
was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Say Travelers From Britain, Denmark Must Be AIDS-Free</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has agreements with Britain, Denmark
and other countries requiring their citizens to prove themselves
free of the AIDS virus in order to enter the Soviet Union, Pravda
reported Friday.
   In its report of an interview with Alexander I. Kondrusev, deputy
health minister, the Communist Party daily did not say whether the
accords already were in force or when they would take effect.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Office in London, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British practice, said he was unaware of
any agreements, but ``the Soviet Union introduced certain
regulations for foreigners over a year ago. That's all we know.''
   No requirement of AIDS tests for visa applications has been
reported.
   The Soviets, who once called the deadly disease a purely foreign
problem caused by Western sexual decadence, have expressed growing
concern about it.
   Tass reported the country's second AIDS death Tuesday, a
4-month-old child from the Odessa region on the Black Sea apparently
infected by its mother. A 29-year-old Leningrad prostitute died of
AIDS in September.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for which no cure has been
found, is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Pravda quoted Kondrusev as saying one way to combat the spread of
AIDS was ``the exchange of certificates, which by agreement with
another country, require anyone coming to our country or leaving it
to show a document that proves negative results from a test'' for
the virus.
   ``Today, such an agreement already exists with the countries of
COMECON, Great Britain, Denmark and others,'' he said. COMECON is
the Soviet bloc equivalent of the European Economic Community.
   Kondrusev said existing regulations require all foreigners
staying more than three months to undergo ``mandatory checkups'' for
AIDS.
   That requirement, which the Soviets said early last year was
under study, never has been mandatory for the thousands of Western
diplomats, business people and journalists who live in Moscow. It
was not clear whether Kondrusev's remarks presaged wider enforcement.
   Some African students who have tested AIDS-positive have been
deported, according to Soviet media reports.
   Kondrusev said the Soviet Union had more than 80 carriers of the
AIDS virus. He said that was low compared with 70,000 AIDS patients
in the United States, but the number of Soviet carriers had nearly
tripled this year.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European health officials published a
statement of non-smokers' rights Friday that will be submitted to
governments as part of a campaign against tobacco.
   The draft document, which recognizes the right to a smoke-free
environment in public areas and at work, was part of a report
presented at the end of the first European conference on tobacco
policy.
   Richard Peto of Oxford University in England said tobacco kills
500,000 Europeans a year and 100 million alive today will die if
current smoking patterns continue.
   ``What is needed is to inform the governments,'' he said. ``An
increasing number of people concerned, even at the ministerial
level, are beginning to realize these are real deaths of real
people.''
   A final version of the document is to be distributed early next
year by the World Health Organization, which joined Spain's Ministry
of Health and Consumer Affairs in sponsoring the Madrid conference.
   Officials from six countries said their governments would
consider adopting the document in combination with higher tobacco
taxes and bans on tobacco advertising.
   They included three health ministers _ Julian Garcia Vargas of
Spain, Philippe Busquin of Belgium and Tove S. Gerhardsen of Norway
_ and lower-level officials from Italy, France and Portugal.
   All said they agreed with much of the statement, including the
rights to air ``free from tobacco smoke'' in enclosed public places
and transport, help for smokers to break the habit and information
on ``the unparalleled health risks of tobacco use.''
   Agreement was not universal on banning tobacco at places of work
and eliminating all advertising.
   Garcia Vargas said: ``We cannot have laws for everything. It is
better to persuade.''
   Ms. Gerhardsen said legislation to increase the price of tobacco
products, ban advertising and create smoke-free environments have
been essential in reducing Norway's consumption of tobacco to one of
the lowest in Europe.
   ``The law is necessary because there will always be people who
don't cooperate with agreements,'' she said.
   Spain passed a law this year that puts restrictions on smoking
and negotiated an agreement with tobacco companies to limit
advertising. Statistics indicate Spain is second only to Greece in
per capita consumption of tobacco in Europe.

<TEXT>
   More than 900 people who feared arrest
after a military coup in September and fled to areas controlled by
rebel groups have returned to their homes, a government spokesman
said Friday.
   Several thousand people who had participated in demonstrations
demanding democracy went to rebel-controlled zones near the border
with Thailand when Gen. Saw Maung seized power Sept. 18 and crushed
the protests.
   His government claims some of those who fled went to the rebels
to receive military training and weapons. The government urged all
of them to return and said it would act only against those who had
committed criminal offenses.
   As of Thursday 919 people, most of them students, have returned
home, government spokesman Kyaw Sann told a news briefing.
   He denied reports that large numbers of people who took part in
the anti-government demonstrations had been imprisoned.
   ``There are no political prisoners,'' he said. ``Those detained
are involved in violation of existing laws. Except for those who are
involved in serious offenses most were released after
interrogation.''
   Kyaw Sann was asked about demands by some political parties that
the nightime curfew and the ban on public demonstrations be lifted.
He said the law and order situation has improved but not enough to
remove those restrictions.
   Opposition parties also have called for the reinstatement of
government employees fired by the military government.
   Kyaw Sann said no action was taken against government workers
``for simply taking part in demonstrations. Action was taken only
against those who exceeded the permissible regulations. Most of them
were pensioned off and some dismissed.'' He did not say how many
workers had been fired.

<HEAD>Purdue Removes ``Worm'' Data From Computer At Government Request</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRAN RICHARDSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Purdue University has complied with a
government agency's request to hide its information about the virus
program that jammed thousands of computers across the country last
week, a researcher said Friday.
   However, such action isn't likely to prevent a determined
computer hacker from wreaking havoc again, said Eugene H. Spafford,
an assistant professor and computer scientist at Purdue, said by
phone from the campus in West Lafayette.
   ``The worry of the National Computer Security Center, and our
worry, is that if somebody gets even a significant portion of the
source code, then they could turn out something more dangerous,''
Spafford said.
   Since hundreds of copies of the errant program already are out,
Spafford believes trying to control the information ``is a losing
battle.''
   Last Thursday, the ``worm'' program rapidly duplicated itself in
computer systems nationwide, spreading like a virus, slowing the
computers' processing speeds and filling up their memories.
   At Purdue, the worm entered a computer connected to Internet, an
international computer network on which researchers from
universities, computer companies and some government installations
share information and resources.
   Officials from the National Computer Security Center, a division
of the National Security Agency, contacted Purdue this week and
asked that worm data be removed from a file where others could have
access to it.
   The Purdue file had ``copies of the worm program and somewhat
disassembled, somewhat reverse-compiled versions of the code,''
Spafford said. ``This could be used to understand how it worked, but
it wasn't in a form that could be used to contruct a new version.''
   He said the university did not consider the data potentially
harmful, but removed it ``in an attempt to be cooperative.''
   However, people who run the thousands of computers affected by
the virus believe they ``need to see the code so they can feel
comfortable that no damage was actually done ... so they can be sure
they plugged all the holes that could be exploited. That's also a
valid viewpoint,'' Spafford said.
   ``One approach (to resolving the problem) might be to widely
publicize the fixes, without distributing the code; then, after a
reasonably short period of time, say three to six months, release
the code,'' he said, explaining that the process would give people
plenty of time to construct defenses against the program.

<HEAD>Three Priests Charged With Sex Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor has filed sexual abuse
charges against three Roman Catholic priests for allegedly molesting
two brothers who were altar boys, and accused the church of
foot-dragging during the investigation.
   ``It was not the spirit of cooperation we would like to see,''
Washington County District Attorney John Pettit said Thursday,
calling it ``minimal at best.''
   Pittsburgh Bishop Donald W. Wuerl denied the allegation, saying,
``I think the diocese has made every effort to be cooperative.''
Wuerl heads the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, which oversees
Washington County.
   Pettit charged the Rev. Richard F. Zula, 47, former pastor at
Sts. Mary and Ann Church in Marianna; the Rev. Robert Wolk, a former
paster and diocesan assistant chancellor of St. Thomas More Church
in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park; and the Rev. Francis Pucci,
former pastor of Immaculate Conception Church in Washington. All
three men have been relieved of their pastoral duties.
   In more than 150 counts, Pettit alleged that the priests sexually
abused the two boys from 1981 to 1987. The homosexual acts allegedly
took place in a barn, a church basement, a parked car and at a
mountain resort.
   Pettit said investigators do not believe the three priests acted
in concert, although Zula and Pucci were charged with one count each
of conspiracy because Pucci allegedly knew of Zula's intentions when
he let Zula use his bedroom at a parish home to have sex with one of
the youths.
   Some of the incidents involved whips, chains, drugs and alcohol,
Pettit said.
   The alleged victims are brothers, now ages 17 and 19, who were
altar boys at St. Thomas More and moved from Wolk's parish to Zula's
in 1982, authorities said.
   Pettit said one of the priests, whom he did not name, may have
been involved in similar incidents in Allegheny and Somerset
Counties and in Florida, Ohio, Virginia and Canada. Four other
youths and an unidentified adult who is not a priest may also have
been involved, he said.
   ``I don't want this to be misinterpreted as a witch hunt,''
Pettit said. ``But we would be sticking our heads in the sand to
believe these are the only three cases.''
   Zula, 47, was charged with 132 counts of involuntary deviate
sexual intercourse and two counts of corrupting minors.
   Wolk, 48, was charged with 22 counts. He was previously charged
in Allegheny County with eight counts of sex-related crimes
involving the same boys.
   The only other charge against Pucci was one count of indecent
assault.
   Pucci and Wolk are undergoing psychiatric treatment for sex
disorders at St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Md., and Zula is
living with his family in Westmoreland County.

<TEXT>
   High levels of explosive methane gas lingered
underground Friday, hampering investigation of a sewer tunnel blast
that killed three workers.
   No one would enter the 2,000-foot tunnel until levels of methane,
a gas formed when organic materials decompose, had dissipated, said
Pat Freeman, safety director for the S.A. Healy Co.
   ``We want it completely purged,'' he said. ``We still don't know
what kind of reading you're going to get way up in the head.''
   Investigators from the Milwaukee County District Attorney's
office and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration
videotaped the site of Thursday's blast but did not enter the tunnel.
   Healy Co. is looking for a contractor to drill a hole at the head
of the tunnel, which would allow the methane to escape and could
speed up the process, Freeman said.
   ``The investigators from the DA's office do want to get down as
soon as we can get in,'' he said. Methane levels should be low
enough next week to allow investigators to enter the tunnel, Freeman
said.
   Phillip Van Kuiken, OSHA safety supervisor, declined to discuss
the investigation, as did Richard Heath, who was representing the
district attorney's office at the scene. Officials are unsure what
caused the blast.
   The explosion ripped through the tunnel at about 9 a.m. as the
three workers carried monitoring equipment to check high levels of
methane that forced workers to evacute.
   Rescue workers, who had to clear explosive fumes and remove
twisted wreckage while contending with poor lighting and knee-deep
mud, took eight hours to remove the bodies.
   Jim Rezka, project engineer, said he would favor installing
remote-controlled methane monitoring equipment that would allow
measurement of gas levels without workers having to enter the tunnel.
   ``There's always a chance of human error,'' he said. ``There'd be
a lot to be said for a (remote-controlled) monitoring system. Even
though they were following a set procedure, anything could have set
off an explosion.''
   The dead were identified as Ron Kohne, 49, tunnel superintendent
from Big Sandy, Tenn.; Tony Bell, 25, shift foreman from Sturgeon
Bay; and Rick Sochacki, 34, of Holland, Ill.

   Hundreds of thousands of gallons of raw sewage
that spilled into a creek forced authorities to close seven miles of
beach near Marina del Rey as a health hazard.
   The spill, discovered Thursday afternoon, was caused by blockage
in a 45 inch-diameter pipe that carries raw waste to a treatment
plant. The sewage overflowed, erupting through an opening that had
been covered by a bolted plate, and ran into Ballona Creek and down
into Santa Monica Bay.
   ``We're talking minimally hundreds of thousands of gallons,
possibly millions. This is a biggie,'' said Anna Sklar of the
Department of Public Works.
   The blockage, which workers were still trying to clear late
Friday, may have been caused by failure of the brick lining of the
decades-old sewer where it crosses under the creek, she said.
   ``This is one of the worst spills we've had. It is also becoming
too frequent,'' said City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is
expected to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley for election next year.
   ``We have a sewer system we are investing a lot of money in right
now and our citizens are not getting their money's worth,'' he said.
``I'm going to ask for an investigation on Monday.''
   Ms. Sklar said sewage mainly overflowed during the morning and
evening peak-usage periods and stopped in between.
   The Health Department posted signs warning beachgoers to stay out
of the water from the Venice Pier to Grand Avenue in El Segundo, and
lifeguards said Friday that most were heeding the warnings,
including youngsters out of school for Veterans Day.
   ``There are tons of kids down here surfing, but they aren't in
the contaminated area,'' said Capt. Steve Voorhoos of the Los
Angeles County Lifeguard's South Bay headquarters. He estimated
crowds in the thousands.
   ``We're attempting to keep the kids out, but some don't hesitate
to go in. All we can do is warn them.''
   Despite sunshine and temperatures in the 70s, few would have
ventured into the chilly 59-degree water anyway, lifeguards said.
Even wetsuit-clad surfers moved into non-contaminated areas to enjoy
the 3 foot waves.
   At Venice Beach, lifeguard Lt. Randy DeGregori said: ``You don't
notice anything that you can see or smell. We haven't really had a
problem. There are lots of surfers here but they aren't in the
closed area.''
   The cause of the blockage was unknown, but vandalism was a
possibility because a sewer cover near the spot had been removed,
Ms. Sklar said. However, it also could have been popped up by the
force of the backup, she said, and authorities were still
investigating.
   ``It's clear that because of the contamination that occurred at
the beach, that the line was blocked for several hours and maybe for
a couple of days,'' she said.
   Crews thought they had cleared the blockage, but later the
problem had returned and sewage was flowing into the creek again,
Ms. Sklar said.

   A Navy anti-submarine helicopter crashed while
preparing to land on a frigate in the North Arabian Sea and its
three crewmen were presumed dead, officials announced Friday.
   The SH-2F helicopter was returning to the USS Barbey at the end
of a dawn flight and crashed on approach, said Ken Mitchell,
spokesman for North Island Naval Air Station. The Barbey is based at
San Diego.
   The crash occurred about 7 p.m. PST Thursday, Mitchell said.
   Lost and presumed dead were Lt. Cmdr. Gerald C. Pelz, 37, of
Coronado, Calif., Lt. j.g. Gerald T. Ramsdell, age unknown, of
Ridgewood, N.J., and the anti-submarine warfare operator, Petty
Officer 3rd Class William E. Martinie, 24, of Peoria, Ill.
   Helicopters from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, 70 miles away,
and boats from the Barbey and USS California unsuccessfully searched
for survivors.
   The craft was part of Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 33.

   Police clashed with demonstrators Friday
night in Warsaw and at least five other cities as thousands of
people joined in rallies and marches on the 70th anniversary of the
rebirth of the Polish state.
   More than 20,000 people chanting ``Solidarity!'' and
``Independence!'' marched from St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw's Old
Town area to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier following a Roman
Catholic Mass at the church.
   Later police fired tear gas and charged about 1,000 young people
gathered at the tomb when some of the youths threw sticks at police,
witnesses reported. They said demonstrators scattered and at least
10 were detained.
   Rallies were held in at least eight other cities _ Gdansk,
Krakow, Wroclaw, Lublin, Lodz, Poznan, Tarnow and Katowice.
Opposition activists said police battled demonstrators in Gdansk,
Poznan, Krakow, Tarnow and Katowice.
   They had few details on the clashes in Tarnow, which took place
after a Mass. Three people were taken to a hospital after being
beaten by police in the southern industrial city of Katowice, said
Maria Moczulska, a spokeswoman for the illegal Confederation for an
Independent Poland.
   In Gdansk, the Baltic port city where the now-outlawed Solidarity
union movement was born, more than 25,000 people attended a Mass,
said opposition spokeswoman Joanna Wojciechowicz.
   She said some of them tried to organize a march and police
attacked with water cannon and clubs and arrested about 10
demonstrators.
   Many people shouted ``Lenin is yours, the shipyard is ours!,''
she added.
   The violence ended when Bishop Tadeusz Goclawski appealed to the
police commander to recall his officers and allow the crowd to
disperse, Ms. Wojciechowicz said.
   Solidarity was founded at the Lenin Shipyard during strikes in
August 1980. Communist authorities announced this month that they
will close the shipyard beginning Dec. 1 because it is losing money.
Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and outlawed the following
year.
   Police in Poznan battled about 4,000 demonstrators and arrested
scores of people, according to a Solidarity activist.
   Witnesses said about 10,000 people participated in a rally in
Krakow and later groups of young people engaged in running street
fights with police.
   The official news agency PAP reported ``aggressive'' protests in
several cities and said: ``In some cities demonstrations and
attempts to disturb public order were undertaken by irresponsible
groups of youth.''
   The Warsaw demonstrators marched to the Tomb of the Unknown
soldier carrying banners bearing the names of various illegal
opposition groups: Solidarity, Confederation for an Independent
Poland, the Independent Students' Association and the Polish
Socialist Party.
   At the Mass, Warsaw Bishop Wladyslaw Miziolek told worshipers,
``The independence of Poland is the concern of every generation.''
   Authorities put on the most elaborate celebration ever under
communist rule to mark the creation in 1918 of the capitalist,
anti-Soviet republic in Poland between the two world wars. It was
the first time such lavish attention has been paid to Poland's
interwar leader, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski.
   On Nov. 11, 1918, a civil council in Warsaw turned over military
power to Pilsudski, who had just been released from a German prison.
He proclaimed an independent Polish state and disarmed the remaining
German troops in the capital.
   The re-establishment of Poland after 123 years of being
partitioned between Prussia, Austria and Russia fulfilled the dream
of generations of patriots.
   A Catholic ``Mass for the Fatherland'' celebrated by the
country's chief military chaplain was televised Friday, one of the
few such services ever shown on state-run TV outside of Christmas
and papal visits.
   The celebrations sharply contrasted with treatment of the
anniversary in the past. Private groups who tried to organize
marches on the date every year after 1974 faced sharp repression.
   In the western city of Poznan, a battle erupted between riot
police and about 4,000 demonstrators, said Solidarity activist
Alexandra Bessert. She said the fighting lasted about two hours and
described police as ``unusually aggressive and brutal.''
   She said scores of people were detained.
   The officer on duty at city police headquarters denied there was
any police action. ``Poznan is a very peaceful city,'' he said, then
hung up.
   In Wroclaw, Jozef Pinior, a leader of the banned Polish Socialist
Party, said marchers walked to a street-car depot where the local
Solidarity chapter began in 1980, carrying signs saying, ``We want
free elections'' and ``Reform through democracy.''
   He said the crowd started with 3,000 people and grew to 10,000.
   In Lublin, in southeastern Poland, Bishop Boleslaw Pylak
celebrated Mass and Ryszard Bender, a parliament deputy who has
called for making Nov. 11 a national holiday, addressed a rally on
the city's main square, Bender said by phone.
   Official attitudes toward the anniversary have softened since the
1981 declaration of martial law, with the military government
embracing popular patriotic symbols and urging unity in the name of
the ``Ojczyzna'' or ``Fatherland.''
   On the broad expanse of Victory Square, Polish Communist Party
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, wearing his army uniform and
accompanied by Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, presided at
hourlong official ceremonies.
   Honor guards representing various branches and divisions of the
military paid homage to the nation, and ambassadors to Poland laid
wreathes at the unknown soldier's tomb.

   A Continental Airlines baggage handler stuck
in the baggage compartment of a plane took off for Chicago from
Newark International Airport on Friday, but was back on the ground
10 minutes later, police said.
   The Boeing 747 made a U-turn for an emergency landing after the
crew heard banging coming from the plane's heated, pressurized
baggage section, said Lt. Frank Kraft of the Port Authority police.
   Baggage handler Darrin Jones, 22, of Newark, got off the plane by
himself and was discharged from Elizabeth General Medical Center
after an examination. ``He was fine,'' said Doug Harris, hospital
spokesman.
   His trip on Flight 383 departed Newark at 6:09 p.m. and was back
on a Newark runway at 6:19 p.m., Kraft said.
   Ned Walker, a spokesman at Continental's Houston headquarters,
said it was the first time the carrier has inadvertently shipped a
handler. ``We will certainly look into circumstances surrounding
this isolated incident,'' he said.
   After Jones got off the plane, Flight 383 took off again for
Chicago without any problem, Walker said.

<TEXT>
   China and Saudi Arabia, participants in a
secret arms deal two years ago, have reached agreement to open trade
offices in each other's capitals, it was announced here Friday night.
   The two countries' ambassadors to the United States, Saudi
Arabian Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and Chinese envoy Han Xu, signed a
memorandum of understanding in Washington on Friday for setting up
``commercial representative offices,'' said a Chinese Embassy
statement.
   The decision was reached ``with a view to further developing the
friendly relations and cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia in
the economic and commercial field,'' embassy spokesman Wu Zurong
said.
   The decision to open trade offices followed disclosures this year
that Saudi Arabia secretly purchased medium-range missiles from
China in 1986. The State Department told Congress last May that
while Saudi Arabia refused to allow U.S. inspection of the Chinese
missiles it assured the United States that the launchers would not
be equipped with nuclear or chemical warheads and it backed this by
signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
   The opening of trade offices is often regarded in diplomacy as a
symbol of thawing relations and a prelude to formal diplomatic
relations between countries that do not recognize each other, such
as Saudi Arabia and the Peoples Republic of China.
   Saudi Arabia is one of the largest countries in the world that
has continued to recognize the rival Chinese Nationalist government
in Taiwan. The policy was explained in the past as one of support
for offshore Taiwan's staunch anti-communism and opposition to the
official atheism of mainland China.
   But in recent months Taiwan newspapers have noted that the Saudis
and some other countries were drawing closer to Beijing and they
have speculated that those countries might switch their diplomatic
recognition. For its part, Taiwan has been relaxing restrictions
against its citizens' private contacts with the Chinese mainland and
expanding trade and other contacts with Communist countries of the
Soviet bloc.
   As of last January, mainland China had formal relations with 135
countries and Taiwan, only 23. The United States switched official
recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 1978 and maintains a broad
range of relations with Taiwan at a non-official level.

   Salvadoran guerrillas said Friday they will
observe a cease-fire during an Organization of American States
meeting in San Salvador next week, but an army commander rejected
the rebels' proposal.
   ``We have decided to suspend the military campaign and declare a
five-day truce during the meeting,'' said Joaquin Villalobos, a
leader of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
umbrella organization of leftist Salvadoran rebel groups.
   Villalobos told a news conference in Mexico City that the rebel
truce would run from 6 p.m. Sunday to 6 p.m. Friday. He also said
the rebels would respond if the army attacked.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is scheduled to attend the
opening session of the OAS conference Monday.
   There was no immediate response from the Salvadoran government to
the rebels' statement but Col. Mauricio Vargas, speaking with
reporters in El Salvador, called the guerrillas' announcement
cynical.
   Vargas is commander of the 3rd army brigade in the eastern
province of San Miguel where the guerrillas are most active.
   ``They (the guerrillas) should not play with an entire people's
desire for pacification,'' Vargas said.
   ``Peace is not a momentary truce,'' he added. ``It should not be
manipulated on the international stage to give the impression that a
certain will exists where it does not in fact exist.''
   Vargas said he would not suspend military operations in the
eastern zone.
   ``We have not entertained the idea of interrupting the
fulfillment of our constitutional duty, which is to combat those who
are killing the people,'' he said.
   Guerrillas have increased their attacks in San Salvador, capital
of El Salvador, and security has been tightened around the city in
recent weeks.
   Villalobos and Leonel Gonzalez, another rebel leader, expressed
hope that President-elect George Bush would change U.S. policy
toward El Salvador, and condemned the military and economic policies
of Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   Gonzalez proposed talks with the Salvadoran government before
scheduled elections in March and said the rebels would set no
preconditions.
   The last meeting between government and rebel representatives was
in October 1987 in San Salvador. The guerrillas have rejected the
government's demands that they first lay down their arms.
   Insurgents began fighting U.S.-backed governments eight years ago
and more than 65,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians.
   In a related development, the armed forces in San Salvador
reported that troops killed 19 guerrillas in three clashes Thursday.
It gave few details and did not mention casualties among government
forces.
   The communique said eight rebels were killed in northeastern
Morazan province, seven at a coffee plantation in the central sector
and four in the southeastern province of Usulutan.
   The Salvadoran rebels claimed they killed a policeman who was on
a bus in San Salvador. A report on the rebels' clandestine Radio
Venceremos said the policeman was killed Thursday night and added:
``The enemy is not safe anywhere.''

   Albert Furrer finally became the last
man at The Last Man's Club annual Veterans Day party on Friday, but
he can't tell you how he outlived 31 buddies.
   ``It's a privilege to be honored by people just for sticking
around all this time, but you know I had to bury a lot of people
along the way,'' said the 96-year-old San Francisco native during
the celebration.
   ``God only knows how I made it,'' he laughed while recuperating
at Brookside Hospital, where he had a malignant growth removed
earlier this week. ``I never abused myself, but I didn't lead a holy
life either.''
   Furrer and the other San Francisco Bay area World War I veterans
started the club as a sort of lark on what was then Armistice Day in
1932. Similar groups have been formed by veterans elsewhere.
   The group met every year, with the idea being that the last
survivor was to get a bottle of Mumm's champagne, as well as an
endowment of cash made up of all those years of annual dues.
   ``I came through floods, fires, wars, and, My God ... you come
through it all, and I don't know if it's an honor or a sort of
curse,'' said Furrer, a former merchant and civic leader who lives
in a nearby nursing home.
   At a ceremony scheduled Friday, Furrer received the champagne
from the family of the club's former secretary-treasurer, Victor
Parachini, who died in February at the age of 89. For the past four
years, they had been the only two surviving members. The bottle is
signed by the club's original 32.
   But there is no cash left.
   Although the club's coffers once held $30,000, the club went
broke five years ago after spending the money on the annual parties
and helping care for several members who fell on bad times.
   And after 56 years, the champagne has soured. A new bottle was
popped as Furrer officially declared an end to the club. He sipped
from a plastic glass and then smiled.
   Furrer says members never talked about the war during their
annual parties because the experience in the trenches of Europe was
something few cared to recall.
   Furrer says he isn't sure he's glad to have outlived his buddies.
   ``It's rough to see all your friends die off,'' he lamented.
``Old people don't make many new friends.''

<TEXT>
   In the latest fallout from California's
insurance rate-slashing Proposition 103, two state senators
threatened Friday to press for multimillion-dollar penalties for
insurers who flee the state.
   Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti and Sen. Alan Robbins also
summoned top executives of seven companies they said had stopped
selling auto or business liability policies to explain themselves at
a legislative hearing.
   Roberti said the hearing and threatened legislation were needed
to show the industry the state intends to carry out voters' demands
for insurance reform.
   ``If they're retaliating against the voters, we will retaliate
against them,'' Roberti, a Democrat, said.
   Proposition 103 would roll back rates on nearly all property and
casualty insurance policies to 1987 rates and then cut premiums an
additional 20 percent.
   Industry spokesman Joe Annotti of the Independent Insurance
Agents and Brokers of California said the senators' threat had
little effect in the face of a state Supreme Court stay on
imposition of the ballot measure.
   Most of the many companies that indicated they might flee the
state because of Proposition 103 suspended that decision after the
high court issued its stay Thursday, he said.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp will challenge the stay
Monday, said spokesman Alan Ashby.
   No matter how the legal battle turns out, a law forcing insurers
to stay in business, incurring what they say will be monumental
losses imposed by the proposition, won't work, said Annotti.
   ``You can't force companies to operate at a loss,'' he said.
   Proposition 103, backed by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, was
approved by a slim margin in Tuesday's election while four other
insurance initiatives sponsored by the industry or by trial lawyers
failed miserably.
   Those results, together with the fact that Proposition 103 had an
advertising budget minuscule by comparison to the other measures,
amount to a voter mandate for reform, said Roberti and Robbins.
   ``The issue today is protecting the integrity of the ballot
box,'' Robbins said, calling the insurers' response ``petulant.''
   The Legislature is not in session, but Robbins, Democratic
chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee, scheduled a hearing Nov.
18 in Los Angeles to examine reported decisions by at least seven
insurance companies either to stop writing liability coverage for
drivers and businesses or to pull out of California entirely.
   The chief executives of those companies are to be summoned to
testify, and subpoenaed if necessary, Robbins said.
   John Kozero, spokesman for Fireman's Fund in Novato, said his
company's top executive was open to discuss insurance reform in any
forum. Spokesmen for the four other companies reached by The
Associated Press weren't able to say if their chief executives would
appear.
   Fireman's Fund, which stopped writing new car insurance after the
election, had sound economic reasons, he said: $29 million in losses
on auto policies last year.
   ``It's simple economics,'' Kozero said. ``As far as personal auto
insurance is concerned, we have not made money in eight of the last
10 years in California. ... When you can't make money in normal
circumstances, you certainly can't make money under 103.''
   Nader, in a CBS interview Friday, belittled the insurer
defections.
   ``This is their usual bluster and boycott threats,'' Nader said.
``What the insurance companies want us to forget is the last three
or four years of overcharging. ... I think that proposition 103 is
simply a little law and order to make them behave.''
   Sixty-seven insurers holding more than 75 percent of the state's
auto insurance policies indicated they would quit that part of the
business after the election, Annotti said. But most decided to hold
off after the stay was issued, he said.

   Procter & Gamble Co. is recalling three batches
of its Duncan Hines Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix after customers
reported finding glass inside the boxes, the company said Friday.
   The company on Friday said seven customers had reported finding
small pieces of glass inside boxes embossed with one of three batch
numbers: 8256C, 8257C and 8258C.
   Only a limited amount of cookie mix with these codes was made and
shipped for sale, all of it in the Middle Atlantic states, New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as Maryland and Washington,
D.C., the company said.
   Merchants were asked to remove Duncan Hines Chocolate Chip Cookie
Mix with those codes from their shelves. Consumers who have
purchased the product with those numbers were asked to return them
to the place of purchase for a refund.
   P&G called the incident ``a highly unusual problem, especially
given the rigorous quality assurance procedures'' used in making its
cookie mix. The company said it had started an investigation to find
out how it happened.

   A man climbed the White House fence Friday
evening but was immediately apprehended without incident, the Secret
Service said.
   Bill Corbett, spokesman for the service, said the unarmed man
climbed the 8-foot fence on the White House's north side at about
6:15 p.m., but did not verbally or physically threaten anyone.
   Corbett said the man's identity will not be released until
Saturday, when a federal magistrate decides if the intruder should
be charged or if he should be held for observation.

<HEAD>50 Wounded At Protest; French Priest Arrested Following Bombing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police on Friday fired buckshot to disperse
demonstrating students, wounding 50, and a French priest was
arrested following a bombing in Lima, authorities reported.
   They said that in another development guerrillas from a small
Marxist organization seized the Lima headquarters of a Peruvian
press association and denounced the killing of a comrade who they
said was murdered by a rival faction.
   Hundreds of students at the state university in Ayacucho, 235
miles southeast of Lima, held an unauthorized street march through
the city, demanding increased government financial support for the
school, police said.
   School officials said 50 demonstrators were wounded when police
opened fire with buckshot to scatter the students. Police said three
policemen were injured in scuffles.
   Authorities said members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla
group, Peru's largest and most violent rebel organization,
infiltrated the march and set off two bombs in the city.
   Ayacucho is the birthplace and stronghold of the Shining Path
rebels, whose eight-year fight to gain control has taken more than
12,000 lives, according to government figures.
   In Lima, police Gen. Fernando Reyes said the Rev. Jean Marin
Mondet of France and three Peruvians were arrested at Marin Mondet's
Roman Catholic church after a bomb explosion there Friday.
   Reyes declined to discuss the circumstances surrounding the
blast, which caused damages but no injuries, saying it was still
under investigation.
   Literature of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
was found at the church, Reyes said. Marin Mondet had been arrested
on suspicion of terrorism in the early 1980s but was released for
lack of evidence, according to Reyes.
   Members of the Journalists Association of Peru said eight armed
members of the Revolutionary Leftist Movement seized the group's
headquarters, holding 12 journalists for 15 minutes while painting
slogans on the building's interior walls.
   The assailants condemned the Tupac Amaru band, claiming it killed
one Revolutionary Leftist member and kidnapped and tortured two
others.
   Both groups endorse Cuba-style Marxism. They had been allied from
January 1987 until the middle of this year. The Revolutionary Left
accused the Tupac Amaru movement of trying to dominate activities.
   The Tupac Amaru group began armed actions in Lima in 1984. The
Revolutionary Leftist Movement has existed since the 1960s but
rarely carries out violent attacks.
   Neither group is believed to be linked to the larger and more
violent Shining Path organization.

<HEAD>Nixon Says GOP Strong At The Top But Weak Below</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush owes nothing to the radical right
or any other group except the voters for his victory, and his
personal triumph was at the same time a Republican Party defeat,
says Richard Nixon.
   ``The party's weakness is vividly demonstrated by its record over
the last eight years,'' Nixon wrote in the last of 12 political
columns for the Sunday Times of London, appearing this Sunday.
   ``When Reagan was inaugurated in January 1981, the Republicans
had 53 senators and 192 congressmen,'' he wrote. ``After eight years
of peace, six years of prosperity, an enormously popular president,
and two more landslide presidential victories, the GOP will have 45
senators and 172 congressmen.''
   Nixon says that Reagan had the total support of the GOP right
wing in 1980 but that Bush had ``only implacable opposition from the
radical right. Bush owes nothing to them, or indeed to any interest
group except the biggest one: the voters.''
   Although the party has in the past stood for peace, freedom,
national unity and national strength, Nixon said, in the campaign
just past ``the best argument the party seemed to be able to make
for itself this year was that Jimmy Carter wasn't one of its
card-carrying members.''
   ``It is not enough just be anti-liberal,'' he wrote.
   While Bush won 4-1 in the electoral votes, it has been largely
overlooked that Bush's margin in 11 states was three percent or less
and ``a shift of only 535,000 votes in these states would have
elected Dukakis,'' he wrote. Included among the eleven are vote-rich
Illinois, California and Pennsylvania.
   Democratic party winners of the past _ Franklin Roosevelt, Harry
Truman, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson _ all were domestic-policy
liberals, Nixon said, but all were credible conservatives on foreign
policy on national defense.
   Dukakis' weakness, Nixon writes, ``was that unlike the Democratic
winners in the past, he was perceived to be weak on defense and
foreign policy.''

   Soviet and U.S. adventurers are planning to journey
from the Soviet Union to Alaska across the Bering Strait, the Soviet
Embassy reported Friday.
   It said Paul Schurke of Emily, Minn., proposed the trip to Soviet
Dmitri Shparo this summer after Shparo traveled with a
Canadian-Soviet team to the North Pole.
   The report said Schurke and Shparo plan to lead a team of up to
12 people, most of whom would be native Siberians or Alaskans.
   It said Schurke is now in Moscow planning the trip and that he
went by dog sled to the North Pole in 1986.
   The embassy news release said the journey could begin as early as
February in the Siberian city of Anadyr and end two months later in
Kotzebue, Alaska.

   Jurors in a murder trial began
watching a videotape Friday in which the defendant, under hypnosis,
assumes the voice of ``Satan'' and other personalities and describes
killing his 19-year-old daughter.
   On the tape, Thomas Lee Bonney's voice took on a demonic snarl as
he was interviewed under hypnosis by a psychiatrist.
   ``You're just a mortal,'' the Chesapeake, Va., man growled,
eyebrows arched, long fingernails clicking on the tabletop. ``You
don't know nothing.''
   ``Satan'' and three other of Bonney's 10 purported personalities
revealed themselves in 23 hours of videotaped interviews with Dr.
Paul F. Dell.
   Dell, a psychiatry professor at Norfolk's Eastern Virginia
Medical School who was retained by the defense, diagnosed Bonney as
having multiple personalities.
   Superior Court Judge Paul M. Wright viewed potions of the tapes
Thursday and ruled they could be shown to the jury. Lawyers said the
presentation of the tapes could last into next week.
   Bonney, 45, is charged with the first-degree murder of his
19-year-old daughter, Kathy Carol Bonney. Her body was found last
November dumped next to the Dismal Swamp Canal, just inside North
Carolina's border with Virginia.
   She was nude and had been shot 27 times. Bonney, who could
receive the death penalty if convicted, pleaded innocent by reason
of insanity and unconciousness.
   On the tape, Bonney assumed the feeble voice of Mammy, his
long-dead maternal grandmother, and called out for Kathy Bonney.
   ``Can you hear me, Kathy?'' Mammy said. ``I'm so old, so old. But
I gotta fix supper. Maybe you'll change your mind. Eat some supper
now.''
   ``She ain't supposed to be living in here,'' Satan interrupted,
referring to Bonney's dead daughter. ``She won't be in here long,''
Satan vowed. ``She called me a bastard.
   ``The gun went off. ... She was sitting there screaming, and I
was hollerin'. And I said, `What are you gonna do?' And she said,
`I'm gonna shoot you, you bastard.'''
   ``I know everything,'' Satan said. ``I am strong. I can do what I
want to, when I want to. I control Tom. He's dumb ... a wimp ... a
goody-goody, talking that Jesus garbage all the time.''
   Suddenly Viking spoke up, a noble, friendly personality and the
first to reveal itself during Bonney's evaluation by Dell.
   ``He's gonna shoot her!'' Viking screamed excitedly, apparently
reliving the night Kathy Bonney died. ``He's gonna shoot her! No!
No! I've got to protect her! Don't shoot her! I love her.''
   Bonney seemed composed as he watched Thursday, he later was
unsteady on his feet as he left the courthouse later. Asked what he
thought of the tape, Bonney said, ``It didn't look like me. I've got
more hair than that. That wasn't me.''
   Wright's decision to allow the tapes to be shown was the second
victory in as many days for defense attorneys John W. Halstead Jr.
and John S. Morrison.
   On Wednesday, the judge excluded from evidence the most damaging
of several incriminating statements Bonney made to police about his
daughter's death. That statement was prohibited because it was not
made available to the defense until after testimony began in the
four-week-old trial.
   Kathy Bonney had argued with her father on the darkened roadside
about a love letter to a married boyfriend, whom Satan called ``that
stupid newt.'' Then, according to the Satan personality, Kathy
Bonney ``called him a bastard. She sorta goofed when she called him
that.''
   ``She thought she was talking to Tom,'' Satan said. ``But she was
talking to me.''

<HEAD>Morrell Awarded $24.6 Million For Illegal Strikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has awarded John Morrell & Co.
$24.6 million in damages from the meatpackers' union for three
strikes at its processing plant in Sioux Falls, and the union has
promised to appeal.
   The award issued in U.S. District Court on Thursday stemmed from
a $40 million lawsuit the company filed claiming the often-violent
strikes were illegal because the Sioux Falls union local had a labor
contract in effect.
   A previous federal jury agreed in March, but a federal arbitrator
ruled Monday that 2,400 union members were legally refusing to cross
a picket line set up by striking Morrell workers from Sioux City,
Iowa.
   ``We will appeal it and we will win on appeal,'' Nick Clark,
assistant general counsel for the United Food & Commercial Workers
Union, said of the damage award.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Battey had refused to let the union
appeal the original finding that the strike was illegal until after
the second trial to assess damages.
   The Cincinnati-based company maintained it suffered $26.5 million
in losses because of the strikes in 1986 and 1987. Witnesses for the
union testified some of the losses were related to market
conditions, including a shortage of hogs and high livestock prices.
   Morrell also is fighting a $4.3 million fine, the largest ever
against a single employer by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. OSHA found the company did little or nothing in
light of hundreds of serious injuries to hand and arm joints caused
by the repetitive motion of the meatpacking line.
   Battey on Thursday postponed enforcement of arbitrator William
Rentfro's ruling that Morrell must rehire workers who struck and pay
them back wages. The judge set court dates on Nov. 29 and Dec. 5 for
Morrell lawyers to file motions asking that the arbitrator's ruling
be nullified.
   Clark said the arbitrator's finding, which could allow an
estimated 1,900 union members to return to jobs they lost 19 months
ago, supports the union's claim that the strikes were legal.
   ``It cuts the legs right out from under this verdict,'' Clark
said.
   George Joseph, an attorney for Morrell, said the arbitrator's
ruling should not affect the jury's verdict.
   ``It is simply a decision of an arbitrator,'' he said. ``The
jury's verdict is binding on all parties, and I expect that that
arbitrator's decision will not be long for this world.''
   Labor negotiations on a new pact continue in Omaha between union
and company officials. The labor contract at the Sioux Falls Morrell
plant expires Nov. 20.

   A decade ago, California spurred a nationwide tax revolt with a
ballot question that slashed rates. Now activists are proclaiming
the birth of another West Coast-inspired citizens movement: the
insurance revolt.
   ``The message from California voters is `Enough is enough,'''
said consumer activist Ralph Nader of Proposition 103, a ballot
measure that cut insurance rates. ``Now we're getting calls from
other states and other groups interested in doing the same thing.''
   It is a prospect that insurance industry officials don't relish,
especially since rebellious rumblings have already been felt in the
New Jersey and Massachusetts legislatures.
   ``California is known in our business as a bellwether state,''
said Ron Howorth, a vice president with the National Association of
Independent Insurers. ``It has always had the position of a
trendsetter and that concerns us.''

   Three workers killed in an explosion while

   A city official defended safety procedures, and said
investigators did not know what triggered the blast.
   In all, six workers have died since 1986 in the $2.1 billion
deep-tunnel sewer project, the largest public works project in
Wisconsin history. Last March, the federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration cited the contractor for inadequate
ventilation.

to heavy combat or the herbicide Agent Orange suffered more post-war
health and emotional problems than those who weren't.
   The Legion's report, released Friday and based solely on
questionnaires returned by veterans themselves, is at odds with the

veterans of the Vietnam era, regardless of whether they actually

   Efforts to smash China's once-sacrosanct
``iron-rice bowl'' system of lifetime employment are taking off in
Shenyang, but a safety net is being woven to catch the growing
legions of jobless.
   This dreary northeastern industrial center, China's fourth
largest city, has become a laboratory for new programs to wean the
communist nation from the inefficient system that guaranteed workers
a job for life regardless of performance.
   For example, Shenyang workers who lose their jobs now can receive
training, counseling and money from local offices believed to be the
first unemployment centers in China.
   City officials say the number of people receiving unemployment
compensation will increase as Shenyang intensifies its economic
reforms by laying off about 300,000 ``redundant'' workers, or 15
percent of the work force. The city's population is 4.1 million.
   ``The purpose of breaking the iron rice bowl is to develop
productivity, to increase the efficiency of our economy ... and also
to quickly improve the people's living standard,'' explained Xu
Qingyong, a top official in the Shenyang Labor Bureau.
   Since 1986, state-run companies in Shenyang have paid 1 percent
of their payrolls into a pioneering unemployment insurance fund that
has been set up in only a few cities. About 700 people have drawn a
total of $10,215 from the local fund, according to Dong Lianzhi,
head of the city's unemployment insurance section.
   The unemployed can draw on the fund for up to two years, she said.
   The average annual wage in China's urban areas is about $270.
   People who resign can collect 75 percent of their previous salary
the first year and 50 percent the second. Fired employees can draw
60 percent of salary for a year and then 50 percent.
   The money is disbursed monthly at offices such as the Huanggu
District Labor Service Co., which is down a narrow alley in northern
Shenyang. According to a large wall chart in the office, the center
received 65 unemployed workers in the first three quarters of 1988
and handed out $1,991.
   Li Hongxing, a 24-year-old with fashionably long hair, was one of
the first workers to receive unemployment compensation from the
office when he decided to quit his job at the post office in
December 1986.
   ``I didn't realize I could get the money,'' Li recalled. ``At
first, I felt a little as though I was letting the country down.''
But he added that without the grant ``life would have been pretty
tough.''
   Li received $10.50 a month for five months before he found a new
job as a salesman. He since has opened a beauty salon and says he
earns up to $108 a month and plans to start up a restaurant.
   Adapting to unemployment, which the communist government for many
years refused to acknowledge existed, is difficult for workers,
officials said. Many of the people who come to the Huanggu labor
office for assistance are enrolled in ``political study,'' a
euphemism for pep talks on finding new jobs.
   The official newspaper Economic Reference reported in September
that about 60,000 ``redundant'' workers already were laid off in
Shenyang, with most taking early retirement, extended maternity
leaves or receiving newly created jobs.
   Xu said the city's unemployment rate is expected to grow from
about 2.5 percent to 4 percent in three years as the work force is
further streamlined.
   Xu conceeded that the superfluous workers ``can't understand why
they are being stripped of their jobs. ... But we don't say we are
not giving you a new job.''
   Authorities must persuade the workers of the importance of the
new system, he said.
   ``Even in a socialist country you should have a sense of
competition, you need to have competition,'' Xu added. ``This is the
way to develop the skills of the workers, this is the only way that
they can realize the contributions they can make.''

   A rare glimpse of Napoleon Bonaparte's military
genius goes to the auction block later this month with the sale of a
handwritten letter outlining secret plans to invade England.
   Written by Napoleon on Dec. 7, 1803, to Adm. Ganteaume, the
letter details three different and daring strategies for maneuvering
60 French ships across the English Channel. In one plan, the idea
was to trick the British into thinking the vessels were on their way
to Egypt.
   ``Let us be masters of the strait for six hours and we will be
masters of the world,'' Napoleon wrote. ``I don't have to tell you
that secrecy is everything.''
   The objective was to cover his army's planned invasion from
Boulogne.
   The first two plans outlined how Napoleon wanted to assemble his
fleets at various places for the final assault from Boulogne. In the
third, a fleet at Rochefort was to leave for Toulon and wait until
an expedition left for Egypt. Then the fleet would head for Boulogne
while a fleet at Brest sailed for Iceland in the North Atlantic.
   The third plan was the most complex because moving one fleet to
Toulon and sending another toward Iceland was designed to trick
Britain's Lord Nelson into heading for Alexandria, Egypt, while
British land forces would be tied up protecting the country's
western coast against the fleet headed of Iceland.
   None of the plans was ever carried out. The invasion fleet was
repeatedly struck by storms and a major part of the fleet was
engaged in a disastrous expedition to Haiti in the Caribbean.
   The letter, nevertheless, is one of the highlights of the
auction, to be held Nov. 29 at the year-old Drouot-Montaigne auction
house off the Champs Elysees in Paris under the auspices of
auctioneers Ader-Picard-Tajan.
   Also up for auction will be 50 pages of letters by the French
novelist Stendhal written while he was following Napoleon's armies
in 1812-13. His account of the Battle of Bautzen _ ``We can see
quite well, from noon to three, all that can be seen of a battle,
namely nothing'' _ would later inspire the famous account of the
Battle of Waterloo in ``The Charterhouse of Parma.''
   In other letters, Stendhal describes the horror of the burning of
Moscow, while complaining about his empty stomach and nagging
toothache and the grossness of his compatriots.
   On Oct. 4, 1812, Stendhal wrote to his sister: ``We left the
city, illuminated by the most beautiful fire in the world. ... The
moon, I believe, shone above the fire. It was a great spectacle, but
one had to be alone to see it. This is the sad condition which
ruined for me the Russian campaign: to have been with people who
would have shrunken the coliseum and the sea of Naples.''
   Sure to delight history buffs and bibliophiles, the auction also
features rare first editions, manuscripts and letters belonging to
Jacques Guerin, one of France's leading collectors and the man who
defended the young Marcel Proust before ``Remembrance of Things
Past'' was universally acclaimed.
   Guerin's collection includes works by dozens of French authors,
including an unusually rare and precious eight-volume edition of the
works of Moliere, long considered the inventor of French high
comedy. Bound in fine, antique Moroccan leather, the books are one
of four first editions of its kind and experts say they are in
excellent condition.
   The Moliere edition dates from 1673, the year of his death, and
is thought to be a first attempt at a complete edition of his works.
   Previous sales in 1984 and 1986 of works from Guerin's extensive
collection brought record prices, said a spokesman for auctioneer
Jacques Tajan.
   ``There will be even more interest this time because of the
beauty of the books and manuscripts, their rareness and especially
the spirit that runs through them,'' Tajan said.
   Other books from Guerin's collection include King Louis XIV's
personal copy of Racine's ``Esther,'' written to celebrate the Sun
King's generosity, the queen's devotion and religious harmony in
France under his reign.
   The play appealed so much to Louis XIV that he would attend
rehearsals and follow the dialogue with his own gold and
leather-bound copy of the text.
   Other works to be auctioned include an original manuscript of
Guillaume Apollinaire's famous ``Le Pont Mirabeau,'' and works by
poets Stephane Mallarme, Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud.

<DATELINE>CLYDACH VALE, Wales (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Where ugly coal-slag heaps stood just
a few years ago, luxury homes now overlook two man-made lakes and
green hillsides in this small vale of the Rhondda Valley, once the
heart of Wales' coal-mining industry.
   Porth Decorative Products, a local company that makes Christmas
ornaments, plans to built a bigger factory on the other side of the
water.
   A site has been set aside for a school, and an application to
build a rugby field is awaiting the approval of local authorities.
   Clydach Vale, about 20 miles north of Cardiff, the Welsh capital,
is an example of how things are changing in Wales.
   ``The last five years have been nothing short of dramatic.'' said
Tony Roberts, deputy chief executive of the Rhondda Borough Council.
   Peter Walker, the British government's Welsh secretary, said:
``The valleys of the 1990s are going to be very much better, nicer,
enjoyable, lively and diverse than anything they've had this
century.''
   Coal was found in the 1800s in the more than a dozen valleys
spread over an area of about 860 square miles in south Wales and
turned the country into the energy capital of the world.
   But its cruel legacy endures, with its depressing scars.
   Welsh writer Richard Llewellyn poignantly warned of it in his
1939 classic, ``How Green Was My Valley.''
   The late Llewellyn's main character, a miner's son called Huw
Morgan, says: ``Our Valley was going black, and the slag heap had
grown so much it was halfway along to our house. Young I was and
small I was, but young or small, I knew it was wrong, and said so to
my father.''
   Today, at the floor of the valleys lie the black remains of the
coal pits, and the winding gear with its wheels and pulleys. You can
still see the railway lines snaking along the abandoned colliery
buildings. Rising upward on the steep hills are the remaining slag
heaps, their blackness visible through the grown-over grass.
   Up the hillsides climb the coal workers' sturdy, terraced houses
in inexorable rows. Many are run down, and some still have outdoor
toilets.
   Large numbers of the area's 700,000 people remain unemployed _
the Rhondda's jobless rate is 25 percent compared with the overall
Welsh rate of 10.3 percent _ largely because of the Welsh coal
industry's continuous decline for the last 60 years.
   In 1920, more than 270,000 workers were employed in hundreds of
pits in the coal industry in south Wales.
   Today, after being especially hard hit by the recession of the
early 1980s, as well as a year-long coal miners' strike in 1984,
just 11 coal mines are left, employing about 7,500 workers.
   The local people's health still suffers from a poor diet and from
having worked in the mines, and tightly knit communities remain
isolated, exacerbating their problems.
   But the transformation has indeed begun, sparked by a complex
combination of national government interventon, local government
initiatives and private enterprise.
   Walker, the Welsh secretary, this past summer launched a new,
three-year program, estimated to cost more than $885 million, to
accelerate the revival.
   The program aims to reduce unemployment by funding training,
offering grants to attract outside investment and giving assistance
to new and small-business men. It also, among other things, is
spending money to improve health services, roads, and public
buildings, the latter so that the valleys' musical heritage can
flourish.
   Already, unemployment has decreased by 13,000 people to 37,000
since January 1986, and in the past nine years, some 350
government-funded factories have been built.
   About 2,900 acres of derelict land have been reclaimed. Usable
land has been particularly valuable in the steep valleys, where it
was scarce long before slag was dumped.
   Some of the slag heaps that were removed were found to contain
combustible coal, and that was sold.
   So far in the 1980s, 45,000 homes have been improved, and private
builders have put up new ones.
   New shops are opening up and the major brewers in the area,
Whitbread and Bass, are spending millions of dollar refurbishing
their pubs.
   ``It's going to be a success,'' David Waterstone, chief executive
of the Welsh Development Agency, said about the revival. ``It's the
change of mood that is the most important thing. Once they want
things to happen, they happen.''

<HEAD>Kenny Rogers Brings Together Sports, Show-Biz Celebrities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SALADINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLBERT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Kenny Rogers had this idea to
invite a few famous friends to his lush, 900-acre farm for a weekend
of golf, tennis, basketball and fishing and wound up with tonight's
prime-time special on ABC.
   ``One thing just led to another and we sort of stumbled into the
format,'' said Rogers, who played host and took part in the
three-day ``Kenny Rogers Classic Weekend.''
   Rogers and 15 other big-name celebrities from show business and
sports split into teams and competed in the four events for $400,000
in prize money.
   The guests include singer-actor Kris Kristofferson, actors James
Caan and Lorenzo Lamas, NBA basketball stars Larry Bird, Michael
Jordan, Dominique Wilkins and Isiah Thomas, tennis stars John
McEnroe, Kevin Curren, Mikael Pernfors and John Lloyd, and golfers
Ray Floyd, Lanny Wadkins, Payne Stewart and Hubert Green.
   The special will include the sports competition as well as a
party that included entertainment by Gladys Knight, the Smothers
Brothers and comedian Byron Allen.
   The festivities were held Sept. 16-18 at Rogers' Beaver Dam Farms
about 75 miles east of Atlanta where there's an 18-hole, par 72,
6,200-yard golf course designed by Rogers, two tennis courts, an
indoor basketball court and two lakes stocked with fish.
   ``All my life I've participated in sports,'' Rogers said. ``I
love basketball and tennis, and I've become obsessed with golf the
last few years. I play every day. That's why I built the golf
course. And everybody is a young kid when you play sports.''
   So Rogers began to formulate his idea.
   ``We had just completed the course last July (1987) and I was not
sure how good it was, so I thought I would invite a couple of pro
golfers to play here,'' said Rogers. ``That was in March or April,
and the concept was born.''
   Rogers said he then thought about tennis, and ``John McEnroe came
to mind, and I knew he liked to play basketball. That's when one
thing just led to another, we got the idea, and so we said, `Why
not?'''
   Another factor, he said, was that the event could be used to
raise money for charities, which Rogers is involved in year-round.
   Celebrities, he said, ``can attract a lot of attention with very
little effort. It's almost selfish not to do it.''
   He said a percentage of the money raised through ticket sales
would go to United Cerebal Palsy and the Homeless of Atlanta and
Athens, Ga.
   ``I'm not sure how much we'll raise for charity this year, but
I'm sure we can generate a lot of money for charity from this event
in future years,'' he said, adding he plans to hold the event
annually.
   The event, which drew about 3,000 spectators for the three days
in cloudy, rainy weather, was the first time Rogers had opened his
farm to the public.
   ``At first I didn't think I wanted a whole lot of folks _ as much
as I love 'em all _ stomping around down there on the farm,'' he
said.
   ``But we talked it over and decided, `What the heck ... let the
people come see it ... they'll probably really enjoy it.''
   Tournament Chairman Kelly Jukerman said the first three players
contacted were Bird, Jordan and McEnroe.
   ``Each one said it sounded like a lot of fun and that they'd be
there,'' he said. ``The next thing we knew was that we had four of
the best basketball players in the world, a bunch of great athletes,
and Kenny. Going in with that, ABC bought it. ...
   ``It was easy getting the entertainers. Kris and Kenny are
friends and Kenny played tennis with Jimmy (Caan) several times in
Los Angeles. Lamas is an athlete. So when we put it together,
actually they were the easiest guys to get. Most actors would like
to be athletes,'' said Jukerman.
   ``They all stayed at the ranch and although they kind of knew
each other, they really didn't know each other. I think a lot of
friendships were made and everybody had fun,'' he said.
   Kristofferson said he agreed to participate, ``although I can't
do any of the things they're doing,'' because charity would benefit.
   ``We all had fun,'' said Rogers.

   Teen-agers Patrick Lovelady and Jeff Hoagland joked
about the possibility of a plane crash as their jetliner was being
de-iced before takeoff during a snowstorm at Stapleton International
Airport.
   ``I hope we don't (crash) because no one ever lives through it,''
Hoagland said a year ago Tuesday.
   Death would spare the two youths from Melba, Idaho, but many
others aboard Continental Flight 1713, would not be so lucky.
   The DC-9 bound for Boise, Idaho, crashed on takeoff, killing 28
of the 82 people on board. A National Transportation Safety Board
inquiry led to findings that blamed ice on the wings and the
captain's failure to order a second de-icing before takeoff.
   Continental Airlines continues to challenge the NTSB conclusions.
The carrier argues that the crash was caused by swirling winds
created by a Boeing 767 jumbo jet that landed three minutes before
Flight 1713's takeoff from a parallel runway.
   Cockpit recordings and testimony during the investigation give
this account of what happened during the final minutes of Flight
1713:
   As the jetliner moved away from the de-icing pad, Capt. Frank
Zvonek, 43, and co-pilot Lee Bruecher, 26, were unaware that the
control tower had lost track of them. They would not begin their
takeoff roll for 27 minutes as heavy snow fell.
   Bruecher, who had recently come to Continental from the commuter
airline ranks, was at the controls of the DC-9-10. Zvonek got Flight
1713's position straightened out with the tower and the aircraft was
cleared for takeoff.
   Zvonek cautioned Bruecher, ``Don't slide.''
   Flight 1713 began to taxi down the runway, and seconds later it
climbed into the sky.
   ``Positive rate,'' Zvonek said six seconds after takeoff,
indicating the jet was gaining proper speed and altitude.
   Three seconds later came a noise thought to be an engine
compression stall, caused by interrupted air flow to the engine
sometimes occurring during a too steep takeoff; then a curse from
Bruecher, then a series of loud bangs and compression stall noises.
   Zvonek grabbed the controls to try to save the careening plane.
   Navy Lt. Curtis Renfro was on a plane landing on a parallel
runway. ``The last time I saw it (Flight 1713), it was grossly
tilted. He was actually up on his starboard wing. When that happens,
the pilot tries to flip to the left to correct. He may have
overcompensated,'' Renfro said.
   The jetliner caught a wingtip and cartwheeled into the runway,
snapping off the nose and cockpit section. Zvonek and Bruecher were
killed. The plane then flipped over on its back and skidded off the
runway through snow and mud.
   Fifty-four people survived, some trapped upside down in their
seats for six hours. A flurry of lawsuits followed, and many are
scheduled to begin trial in Denver U.S. District Court on Dec. 5.
   Within a month of the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration
issued a memo ``strongly urging airlines, whenever feasible, not to
mix two inexperienced pilots in a crew,'' said FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar in Washington.
   The DC-9 experience of Zvonek and Bruecher was examined during
NTSB hearings in Denver last March.
   Zvonek, a former Navy pilot and flight instructor, had about
12,000 hours of flying time, including experience flying large
jetliners. He had been rated to fly the DC-9 seven months before the
crash and had 133 hours on that type of aircraft, with 33 hours as a
DC-9 captain.
   Bruecher had 3,200 hours of flying time, 36 in a DC-9 including
training flights. His total commercial flight time in DC-9s was 11
hours.
   It was also brought out that Bruecher had been fired by Able
Aviation of Houston in 1985 for failing flight tests.
   The NTSB report said Able's flight instructor recalled that
Bruecher ``had a chronic problem of stepping on the wrong rudder,
becoming disoriented and described (Bruecher) as tense and unable to
cope with deviations from the routine.''
   Bruecher flew turboprop planes two years for Rio Airways of
Killeen, Texas, until hired by Continental in July 1987. Continental
said background checks did not reveal Bruecher's dismissal by Able.
   The NTSB's final report in late September laid part of the blame
for the crash on the captain's failure to have the jetliner de-iced
a second time after the plane sat in steady snowfall for 27 minutes.
The NTSB also cited the inexperience of the captain and his co-pilot
in flying DC-9s and the heavy traffic conditions at the airport as
contributing factors.
   The NTSB reports also said Bruecher lifted the nose of the plane
off the runway at too sharp an angle, adding to the problems the
plane already faced in gaining lift because of ice on the wings.
   As a result of the Flight 1713 crash, the NTSB has recommended
that the FAA require intensifed de-icing procedures for the DC-9-10
series aircraft, which do not have leading edge slats on their wings
for additional lift, said the safety board's Ted Lopatkiewicz in
Washington, D.C.
   The NTSB also recommended the FAA revise its rules on minimum
cockpit experience ``to prohibit the pairing on the same flight of
pilots who have less than the minimum experience in their respective
positions,'' Lopatkiewicz said.
   ``We're not talking about changing minimum experience levels, but
minimum experience levels to be paired with another inexperienced
crew member,'' he said.
   The FAA is expected to respond to the NTSB recommendations by
early Feburary.
   Lewis Jordan, Continental's chief operating officer, said his
carrier has launched a program to prevent pilots with under 100
hours in a particular aircraft type from being paired in the same
cockpit.
   ``I believe you'll find Continental is the only airline that has
done that,'' Jordan said.
   Continental's chief pilot is required to ``track'' all of its
pilots with less than 100 hours in certain aircraft types, Jordan
said. The pilots themselves are honor-bound to report whether their
experience level falls below this threshhold.
   The data is put in a computer program to ``flag any potential
pairing of a captain and a first officer who have low time in a
particular aircraft,'' he said.
   Jordan said the former employers of pilot applicants cannot be
forced to release personnel information, but noted that Continental
training, designed to help pilots overcome weaknesses or weed them
out, exceeds federal requirements.
   Since the crash, Continental pilots have been instructed to
request takeoff delays if a large jetliner is landing on a parallel
runway. Jordan is convinced that with Denver's close, parallel
runways, swirling winds, called wing vortex, played a major role in
the crash.
   ``We are quite disappointed that the NTSB stopped short of
investigating that as thoroughly as we think they must,'' said
Jordan, who called Flight 1713's crew ``highly professional and
innocent pilots.''

   For Paul Vermeulen, a 24-year-old flight
attendant hurt in the crash of Boise-bound Continental Flight 1713 a
year ago, part of the recovery process has been his work in helping
organize Tuesday's memorial service for victims.
   ``Physically I'm fine; mentally I'm a wreck,'' says Vermeulen,
who suffered broken ribs and a collapsed lung in the crash that
killed 28, half of them from Idaho. ``But I'm getting my life
together.''
   The memorial service in Boise, exactly one year after the crash
on takeoff at Denver's Stapleton Airport, is one of two planned this
month in Idaho.
   Another ceremony is planned the day after Thanksgiving in Melba,
a southwestern Idaho farming town of about 300 that lost three young
people in the wreckage of the DC-9.
   They were part of a 10-member delegation from the town returning
from a Future Farmers of America convention in Kansas City, Mo. Tami
Daniel, the wife of Melba FFA adviser David Daniel, and students
Janine Ledgerwood and Sherry Nelson were killed.
   Earlier this month, David Daniel again led a Melba delegation to
the FFA national convention, again in Kansas City. Among the five
members was Angie Tlucek, 18, who had spent five days in critical
condition after the 1987 crash with severe burns and a collapsed
lung.
   The crash, Daniel acknowledged, was on the delegation's mind
``but hopefully not too much.''
   Miss Tlucek was valedictorian of her graduating class at Melba
High last May.
   She was elected state FFA vice president and named one of 51
``Unsung American Heroes'' in the July 4 edition of Newsweek
magazine. She now is a student at Northwest Nazarene College in
nearby Nampa.
   ``Everyone is doing as well as they can,'' said Angie's mother,
Mary Lou Tlucek. ``It is not the kind of thing you get over in a
year or two.''

   Federal watchdogs are hoping to scare away
potential fraud, mismanagement and other problems now plaguing the
beleaguered thrift industry by revamping their system for examining
savings and loans.
   But whether their bite will turn out to be worse than their bark
remains to be seen.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's
3,200 federally insured S&Ls, has failed to prevent the problems
that have sent the industry into the financial dog house.
   Right now, about a quarter of all S&Ls are considered at or near
insolvency, and analysts estimate it could cost as much as $100
billion to liquidate them.
   Still, it hasn't been all the bank board's fault. Budgetary
restraints forced the government to cut back on the number of thrift
examiners needed to comb through financial books and detect
potential problems. The remaining examiners _ there were only 700 as
recently as two years ago _ found themselves underpaid, overworked
and with little guidance.
   The bank board hopes to start changing things around by
overhauling the examination process through a new guidebook _ a sort
of bible for evaluating savings and loans _ now being issued to its
1,500 examiners in 12 districts nationwide.
   The handbook represents the first major revision of evaluation
methods in seven years and draws upon examination procedures already
being used by the Federal Reserve Board, comptroller of the currency
and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Its goal is to detect problems earlier than in the past, thus
reducing the number of future thrift failures and the drain on the
already burdened Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   Bank board spokesman Paul Lockwood explained some of the
revisions:
   _Changing Priorities. The new book takes a ``top-down'' approach
to examinations, focusing on overall policies and procedures of an
institution, rather than its individual loans. The old book used a
``bottom-up'' approach, beginning with individual loans.
   _Safety First. Examiners are encouraged to begin enforcement
actions against institutions acting imprudently even if its actions
are permissible. The old book focuses on whether an institution
complied with specific regulations.
   ``The whole idea is to make management more accountable for what
goes on,'' Lockwood said.
   _Speaking English. While the old book permitted examiners to
write their reports in technical language, the new one urges they
become more understandable to their audience: a company's board of
directors.
   ``The regulators have been so darn busy over the last three or
four years that they really didn't have the resources to keep the
(old) book up to date,'' said Lockwood. ``As a result ... each of
the 12 regions of the country headed by a home loan bank was left to
devise their own procedures and standards.
   ``Obviously some did a better job than others.''
   In addition to the new handbook, the bank board has beefed up its
examiners' staff, raised salaries and provided retraining courses.
   A few critics will argue that an overhaul of the examination
process now is a bit like locking the barn door after the horses
have fled.
   ``There's a real fundamental problem with the whole evaluation
process,'' said Bert Ely, a Alexandria, Va., consultant. ``I'm not
sure it needs more manpower. The trick is to use the numbers to let
you know when to go in and take a closer look.
   ``They need to be relying on their computers to monitor and
evaluate frequently reported data, like a financial EKG monitoring
ups and downs.''
   Still, others praise the bank board's effort as a step in the
right direction.
   ``I think the critics are missing the point,'' said R. Dan
Brumbaugh Jr., a San Francisco consultant and former deputy chief
economist for the bank board. ``It's clear that no examiner handbook
or any changing strategy will resurrect the insolvent institutions,
but we still have approximately 2,100 that are solvent.
   ``We've got to learn from the problems of the past and I'm
certain the bank board has ample examples from which to draw upon.''

   In small towns across America, fall Friday
nights are traditionally reserved for football fever. But in a
remote, rural corner of Mississippi, two gridirons are knee-deep in
pale, yellowing grass.
   No bands have strutted, no cheerleaders have cheered, no burly
helmeted youths have raced up and down bright stripes of green and
white this autumn. The 1988 Liberty High Bobcats and Gloster High
Hornets never took the field.
   Angry black parents, protesting appointment of a white principal
at Gloster High School, all but shut the county school system
earlier this fall, ending the season before it even began.
   The boycott was especially effective because in Amite County,
population 12,000, blacks comprise 80 percent of public school
students. Most white families, as in other Southern states, send
their kids to private ``segregation academies.'' Indeed, part of the
objection to the new principal is that he sends his children to an
all-white private school.
   ``Those white schools are having their football season and it's
sad, especially for the children, that we aren't having ours,''
Clarence McDowell, Liberty's principal, said recently as he surveyed
the forlorn football field and delapidated pile of wooden bleachers
euphemistically known as Bobcat Stadium.
   McDowell, a short, soft-spoken man, stared silently at the field
for another moment and added, ``The school superintendent canceled
football here at Liberty and over at Gloster High because of the
boycotts. It didn't have to happen, but neither side would give.''
   The two sides in question are the Amite County School System,
headed by superintendent Maurice Foreman, and The Concerned Citizens
for Better Education Committee, a group of black parents led by J.C.
Patterson, whose two children and three stepchildren attend public
schools in Liberty.
   The Concerned Citizens coalesced after Foreman announced that
Robbie Robertson, the white assistant principal at Gloster High,
would succeed Gloster's retiring black principal this fall.
Robertson's children attend a private, all-white academy just over
the line in neighboring Wilkinson County.
   ``It's bad enough that they passed over qualified black
applicants to hire him,'' said Patterson, a 39-year-old farmer and
construction worker. ``But we just aren't going to allow them to
push us out and put in a man who thinks his children are too good to
attend public schools.''
   The citizens committee initially staged a two-week boycott
against the white merchants of Gloster and Liberty, populations
1,200 and 700.
   Liberty Mayor Gerald Miller acknowledged the boycotts hurt
business. ``The economic conditions around here are not that great.
We're dependent upon oil and timber, so we need everybody to ptich
in and support the county,'' he said.
   When classes began Aug. 27, the boycott shifted to the county's
four public schools, two elementary and two high schools. Black
children were taught in makeshift classroooms set up in churches.
   Gloster High, with 350 students, was completely shut down. At
Liberty, with an enrollment of 600, only 50 students, mostly whites,
attended class.
   ``We called off the boycott at the beginning of October, after
the Justice Department agreed to investigate,'' Patterson said.
``Right now, we're waiting to see what happens.'' Investigators have
visited several times but Justice has yet to release a report or
make recommendations.
   Patterson said Robertson's ouster is not the group's only demand.
The parents also want better courses, more black administrators, new
schoolbooks and improved facilities.
   ``The books are a crime,'' Patterson said. ``Many of them are
outdated and were discards from other counties.'' He said Liberty
High was ``a dump and a rat trap.''
   This fall's walkout was the second major school boycott in Amite
County.
   In 1977, after the first boycott, the system was placed under
federal court order to cease segregating students by sex and to
follow various racial guidelines, one being that there would be at
least two black principals.
   ``But the order was dropped in 1984 (after school officials said
they'd met guidelines) and the schools have gone downhill ever
since,'' Patterson asserted. ``Now, of the 10 administrators in the
county system, only one, Clarence McDowell, is black. And he's
thinking about retiring because he gets no support from Maurice
Foreman, the white superintendent.
   ``Then, too,'' he added, ``Foreman keeps hiring white teachers,
including people who send their children to private schools. And, on
top of that, our children's test scores have been dropping every
year.''
   Foreman acknowledged Patterson's claims but said he'd hired white
teachers to try to attract white students. ``But even with these
hirings, whites still make up only 33 percent of the employees in
our school system,'' he said. He said more than 60 percent of Amite
County teachers are black.
   Foreman, who is elected, also admitted high school test scores
are weak. ``It's true that we're way below the national (ACT)
average,'' he said, and 20 percent of the 11th graders failed the
state literacy test last year. But he blamed what he called ``the
private school crowd.''
   ``This was last county in America to operate a public school
system that had boys and girls going to separate schools,'' he said.
``We lost a lot of whites in 1970, when we had to integrate, and
lost a lot more in 1977, when we were ordered to drop the separate
sexes plan installed in 1971.
   ``Until recently,'' he said, ``the county Board of Supervisors
was dominated by the private school crowd; they wouldn't give me
anything but the bare minimum (tax) millage to run the schools.''
   Since the law governing control of county budgets was changed two
years ago, he said funding has improved.
   ``We're starting to make progress,'' he said. ``We've got a new
vo-tech school and our elementary schools are in good shape. What we
need now is a new, consolidated high school. ... It doesn't make
good sense to operate two small high schools 20 miles apart.''
   The dispute has stirred racial feelings, but neither side
welcomed a march through Liberty by a band of white supremacists on
Oct. 15. Their leader, Nationalist Movement founder Richard Barrett
of Jackson, said they supported Robbie Robertson. Robertson,
however, said he wanted no such champions.
   ``I didn't ask for their support,'' he said. ``I don't know them
and I want nothing to do with them.''
   In an interview in his high school office, Robertson acknowledged
the problems caused when he was chosen from among three black and
four white candidates.
   ``This puts me in an uncomfortable position,'' Robertson said.
``The blacks didn't want a white principal. It made them mad when I
was appointed, and then they used the fact that I send my children
to private schools as an excuse to stage their boycotts.''
   When asked why he chose not to patronize the public schools, he
replied, ``I just don't care to say.''
   Robertson said he'd experienced much less friction at school from
students than he had expected. Patterson, however, said about 100
students _ almost a third of Gloster's enrollment _ had transferred
after the boycott to Liberty High, where McDowell is the county's
sole black principal.
   Meanwhile, there is little joy in Amite County on Friday nights.
   ``We should be getting ready for our big game with Gloster, our
arch rival,'' McDowell said. ``But there'll be nothing but rabbits
and wild turkeys on the field that night and it hurts.''

<HEAD>The Diplomatic Effort to Block a Second Round of Cambodian Genocide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's plan to remove its forces from
Cambodia has touched off a flurry of diplomatic moves to spare that
country the return to power of what is widely regarded as one of
history's most genocidal regimes: the Khmer Rouge.
   According to diplomats and private experts, there is little
reason to suspect that the Khmer Rouge has changed much since the
1975-78 period when it killed between 1 million and 2 million
Cambodians.
   Even if the lower figured is accepted, it meant the death of one
Cambodian every two minutes during the three and a half years in
which the Khmer Rouge sought to eradicate virtually overnight all
vestiges of capitalism and to create an exclusively
agriculture-based society.
   The Khmer Rouge, now operating as a large and highly disciplined
guerrilla group, has been projecting an image of moderation lately,
admitting that mistakes were made in the past and proclaiming that
the movement is now guided by the principals of ``liberal
capitalism.''
   This claim has been received with almost universal skepticism by
experts on Cambodia.
   S.A.M.S. Kibria, the United Nations coordinator for humanitarian
assistance to Cambodia, has said that about 7,000 Cambodian refugees
who were living under Khmer Rouge control in camps along the
Thai-Cambodian border disappeared earlier this year.
   Kibria's allegation was supported by Tony Jackson, the Cambodian
policy adviser for Oxfam, the international relief agency based in
Britain.
   Officials at the United Nations, which provides humanitarian aid
to the more than 300,000 Cambodian refugees stationed at the Thai
border camps, said they believe the 7,000 Cambodians alleged to have
disappeared were marched into the Cambodian interior transporting
arms to the Khmer Rouge.
   About 70,000 Cambodian refugees live in Khmer Rouge-controlled
camps but their fate is largely unknown; the guerrillas generally
refuse access to outsiders.
   The Reagan administration envisions a leading political role
after the Vietnamese withdrawal for Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was
Cambodian head of state until his ouster in a 1970 coup.
   Sihanouk has said that one ``has to be either naive or an idiot
to believe that the Khmer Rouge of the 1980's can be different from
the Khmer Rouge of the 1970's.'' Much of the earlier leadership,
including Khmer Rouge chieftain Pol Pot, continues to run the
movement from clandestine camps.
   Sihanouk heads one of two non-communist resistance forces in
Cambodia which is fighting the Vietnamese-backed government. The
other is led by former Prime Minister Son Sann. The two groups have
an estimated 10,000 troops each and receive non-lethal aid from the
United States.
   But the Khmer Rouge is considered by far the most potent of the
rebel forces, heightening concern among the United States and other
interested parties about a return to power by that group.
   Partially as the result of Khmer Rouge military pressure, Vietnam
has committed itself to the withdrawal of 50,000 forces by the end
of this year and its remaining troops, estimated at about 70,000, by
1990.
   The Vietnamese announcement was greeted with relief by much of
the international community, which has applied strong diplomatic
pressure on Hanoi to end its military occupation of Cambodia.
   At the same time, the possibility that the Khmer Rouge could fill
the power vacuum created by the Vietnamese withdrawal set off alarm
bells in foreign ministries on several continents.
   Lately, the State Department has been increasingly vocal about
the importance of a political settlement in Cambodia that prevents
the Khmer Rouge from assuming the dominant role in Cambodia once the
Vietnamese leave.
   The U.N. General Assembly recently approved its annual resolution
calling for a Vietnamese withdrawal. But for the first time, in a
clear reference to the Khmer Rouge, it also said Cambodia must not
return to ``the universally condemned policies and practices of the
recent past.''
   The Cambodian conflict has found China and the Soviet Union on
opposite sides.
   The principal backers of the Khmer Rouge have been the Chinese,
who see the extension of Vietnamese power into Cambodia as a threat
to national security. For years, reduction of Soviet influence
nearby, either directly or through their main southeast Asian ally,
Vietnam, has been a hallmark of Chinese foreign policy.
   Under heavy international pressure, China has backed away
somewhat from its all-out support of the Khmer Rouge effort to drive
out the Vietnamese invaders.
   ``The Chinese recognize their support for the Khmer Rouge is a
liability internationally,'' said one U.S. official.
   According to U.S. government experts, the Chinese also may be
temporizing their support out of concern that a Khmer Rouge triumph
could induce the Vietnamese to reinvade Cambodia.
   Meanwhile, the United States and its friends in the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been discussing strategies
for preventing a Khmer Rouge takeover.
   Among the possibilities discussed are the formation of an
international peacekeeping force for Cambodia or the disarming of
the various armed factions.
   Until Hanoi's announcement of its intention to withdraw, the
Khmer Rouge component of the Cambodian problem was given secondary
priority by the administration. Now, both aspects of the problem are
being given equal billing.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Lambertson has told
Congress that the administration ``is unalterably opposed to the
Khmer Rouge, whose legacy of brutality and depravity is unsurpassed.
   ``We are committed to a settlement in Cambodia that contains
safeguards to ensure that the Khmer Rouge can never again take
control of Cambodia and subject the Cambodian people once again to
the horrors of the past.''
   Still, some in Congress believe the administration remained
silent too long on the Khmer Rouge.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., co-sponsor of a resolution critical
of both the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese occupation, assailed the
``self-imposed silence of the American government'' in dealing with
the revival of the Khmer Rouge.
   Because of this policy, ``the Khmer Rouge was nursed back to
health by Communist China and are poised to return to their old ways
of torturing and terrorizing the people of Cambodia,'' Hatfield said.
   With U.S. backing, the United Nations has refused to recognize
the legitimacy of the current government in Phnom Penh and instead
recognizes what amounts to a Cambodian coalition government in
exile, a fragile union made up of the Khmer Rouge and the two
non-communist rebel factions. But the permanent representative of
Cambodia at the United Nations is a Khmer Rouge member.
   The administration also expressed forceful opposition to a clause
in the congressional resolution on Cambodia which demanded an
``immediate'' halt to outside support for the Khmer Rouge.
   The State Department said that phrasing would be rejected by
Chin. It successfully lobbied for the removal of the offending word.
   Some members of Congress were aghast at this concession by the
administration to the Khmer Rouge but relented out of concern that a
protracted battle could mean the entire resolution would have to be
shelved.
   President Reagan signed the resolution during the waning days of
the recently adjourned Congress.
   If Vietnam keeps its promise to withdraw, officials say U.S.
policy toward Southeast Asia may become a major issue for the
incoming Bush administration as it tries to contend with a
discredited group which, for now, is casting the longest shadow over
post-Vietnam Cambodia.

<HEAD>Holy Relics under New Scrutiny in Italy following Shroud Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tiny woman dressed in black and stooped with age
dropped to her knees and gingerly began to crawl up the 26 Holy
Stairs in Rome. She paused at each step to pray or to kiss the
crucifix of her rosary after touching it to a spot where Christ's
blood supposedly fell.
   The stairs, which are across the street from Rome's St. John
Lateran church, are among hundreds of relics and venerated objects
in Italy linked to Jesus or saints that have inspired the faithful
for centuries.
   But these relics have come under new scrutiny in the Italian
media since the Roman Catholic Church announced in October that
scientists had determined the Shroud of Turin, perhaps the most
famous of all, cannot be the burial cloth of Christ as many believed.
   There is no proof, only tradition, to support claims the marble
steps brought to Rome once ascended to Pilate's palace in Jerusalem
and that Jesus, bleeding from Roman whips, tread on them.
   Still, the old woman's painful climb up the crowded stairs
underscores that for many Roman Catholics such objects are a
cherished link and that the church can consider religious symbolism
more important than questions of authenticity.
   ``Relics are the means, the physical mean of rediscovering or
keeping in touch with the history of the faith,'' said Monsignor
Robert Sarno, an official with the Vatican's Congregation for the
Causes of Saints.
   ``It is a means of strengthening one's faith, which in essence is
a closer relationship with God.''
   After carbon-14 tests showed that medieval weavers made the cloth
in the Holy Shroud, Italian newspapers noted the same method could
date what are believed by many to be fragments from the cross on
which Christ died, thorns from Christ's crown or blood of St.
Januarius of Naples.
   The newspapers noted that about 70 sanctuaries around the world
claim to have drops of milk from the Virgin Mary's breast, while
innumerable others lay claim to fragments of the cross or the hair,
fingernails or tears of Jesus, and that there are at least 30
``genuine'' nails from the crucifixion.
   Church officials say it does not expect a ``witch hunt'' for
false relics or a purge of reliquaries.
   Sarno said, however, he sees no reason the church would not agree
to such scientific tests on relics if the authenticity was seriously
questioned.
   ``We have to rid ourselves of the idea that the church is afraid
of science. There can be no contradiction between faith and science.
Faith and science both come from God,'' he said.
   Scientists and others outside the church have long been intrigued
by the origin of the Shroud of Turin's faint, haunting image of a
man who appeared to have been whipped, speared, crucified and
crowned with thorns.
   Although some revered it as the actual burial cloth of Jesus, the
church never recognized it as a relic. Instead it was considered a
cherished object, one treated with respect because it could be
linked to Christ.
   Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, who as archbishop of Turin is
caretaker of the shroud, said in October he had no reason to doubt
carbon-14 tests that indicate the cloth was made between the years
1260 and 1390.
   But he said the shroud remained a powerful symbol. Ballestrero
and other church officials point out that the other scientists
determined that the shroud was not the work of an artist. And since
the mystery of the creation of its image perists, church officials
do not rule out it could still be the work of God.
   The point Ballestrero and others seek to make is that the
spiritual value to people like the devout old woman struggling on
the stairs in Rome can outweigh historical questions about objects
such as the shroud, the steps, fragments of the cross and the
myriads of saintly relics.
   Still, Sarno emphasizes that historical verification of relics is
``a necessity.''
   ``A relic is an authentic, verifiable piece of history which has
theological significance and spiritual meaning for the individual
faithful,'' he said.
   ``It refers to the mysteries of faith and the purpose is to
arouse, strengthen and increase the faith of an individual who uses
that object to reach the Lord.''
   He notes that the church ``condemns idolotry'' and that the
church frowns on the idea that a relic can serve as something other
than an instrument to strengthen the faith.
   In Naples, the faithful crowd into the cathedral twice a year to
wait for what they believe is the dried blood of St. Januarius, the
city's patron saint, to liquify. The substance almost always
liquifies on Sept. 19, marking the day the saint was beheaded for
his faith in the year 305, and on the Saturday before the first
Sunday in May.
   Neapolitans believe the liquification means good fortune for the
city or even for its beloved soccer team. The failure of the blood
in two glass ampules to liquify is seen as a bad sign.
   The Vatican does not classify the liquification as a miracle and
generally disapproves of its use as an omen.

<BYLINE>Campaign Aftermath: `Negative Ads Work. Use Them.'
^By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the presidential campaign entered its last
two weeks, Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk declared at a news
conference that ``the American people know this election belongs to
them, not to Roger Ailes.''
   True or false, it was telling evidence of the pervasive influence
exerted by the man who shaped President-elect George Bush's kinder,
gentler media image and orchestrated slashing attack commercials
against Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   The task was basic: Tear down Dukakis and build up Bush. And
experts agree, the execution was brilliant. But on the morning
after, some are concerned about the legacy left by the relentless
attack strategy.
   ``The Bush campaign has been rewarded with the White House for
the most negative broadcast campaign in the last 30 years,'' said
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a political communications expert at the
University of Texas.
   ``The lesson is clear,'' added Larry Sabato, an elections
specialist at the University of Virginia. ``Negative ads work. Use
them.''
   The two academics said a greater proportion of the candidates'
advertising was negative and the attack spots were on the air for
longer than ever before in a presidential campaign.
   ``Candidates don't bother with the positive phase anymore,''
Sabato said. ``They never go completely positive either at the
beginning or the end.''
   Bush's ads, reflecting his campaign themes and news coverage,
lashed out at the Massachusetts governor on everything from
pollution in Boston Harbor and problems in a state prison furlough
program to Dukakis' stands on defense and the death penalty.
   Jamieson said voter savvy, news coverage and opponent
counter-attacks generally are sufficient to check the impact of
false, distorted or misleading political advertising.
   ``This year has made it very clear that the existing protections
only work if the other side is equally competent in its use of
advertising and debates and if the press does its job very, very
well,'' she said. ``Dukakis didn't respond in ads. He didn't respond
in debates. This year, until the last two and a half weeks, the
press was expected to do it alone. And the press alone can't do it.''
   Dozens of media professionals offered reams of advice to Dukakis
over the course of his campaign. Early in the game, several
suggested that he might capitalize on ``positive curiosity'' by
starting his TV campaign right after the convention in July. He
waited until September, consequently losing a chance to define
himself before the Bush onslaught.
   Others pleaded with Dukakis to take a dramatic step to seize
control of the campaign agenda _ in the second debate, for example,
ask Bush to agree to a moratorium on negative ads or challenge him
to a weekly man-to-man debate until the election. He didn't, and by
virtually all accounts lost the debate.
   Most advertising ideas never made it as far as film or videotape.
Hundreds of scripts were received, and hundreds were shelved. And
unlike Ailes, an inner-circle strategist for Bush from the outset,
no Democratic media expert was let into the Dukakis loop.
   ``We were in another room. We weren't working together,'' said
Theodore Voss, a New York advertising consultant who helped recruit
talent for the campaign. Furthermore, the ad department was ruled by
a group of high-level campaign officials that one insider likened to
a jury needing a 12-0 vote to make any decision.
   In short, Dukakis sorely needed a Roger Ailes.
   ``The thing that was wrong was not having a strong advertising
director to set direction, to motivate and to say yes or no,'' Voss
said. ``There's no question in my mind that the ads could have been
superb had there been better organization.''
   Hoping to break through the inertia and bureaucracy, the
Sawyer-Miller Group in New York took to writing, producing and
paying for Dukakis spots on its own on the chance they might be used.
   The tactic worked in some instances, but the group struck out
with what might have been a key environmental ad _ a hard-hitting,
lightning-fast response to Bush's famous Boston Harbor attack ad
that was finished and shipped the same day the Bush spot first
aired. It was never used.
   When the national Dukakis campaign finally went negative, it
focused for a long time on the Dan Quayle veep selection and the
``packaging of George Bush.'' Neither message had the gut-level
appeal of crime or militarism or patriotism or clean water, the hot
buttons pushed so skillfully by Bush and Ailes.
   Ailes had a few things going for him in addition to the
ineptitude of the Dukakis ad campaign. Republicans and some
Democrats cite peace, prosperity and other successes of the Reagan
years. Scott Miller, of Sawyer-Miller, said Bush's unformed public
image was another advantage.
   ``What Roger had to work with was an advertising man's dream _ a
product without a label on it, that he could define and shape pretty
much the way he wanted,'' he said. ``I don't believe there's another
such candidate on the national scene in either party.''
   Kirk and others have denounced Ailes as the dark genius behind
Bush's airwaves assault, but Miller defended his GOP compatriot and
said the ultimate responsibility for questionable Bush tactics lies
with Bush.
   ``It's not up to Roger Ailes to make the decision that he's
asking the candidate to say things that contradict his values or
positions or ethics. It's up to the candidate to say `that's not me'
or `I won't do that,''' Miller said. ``Roger did what he was paid to
do and he did an excellent job.''

<HEAD>Reggae Roots Push Maxi Priest Up the Charts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reggae version of Cat Stevens' ``Wild World''?
It wasn't Maxi Priest's idea.
   ``I never wanted to do it. It was the choice of the record
company,'' admitted Priest, who nonetheless went No. 1 for four
weeks with the song on the British singles chart.
   ``All the way from London to Jamaica I was saying, `I don't want
to do this. I don't like this record,''' he said, adding, ``I enjoy
the song now.''
   Though only 25, Priest is already a veteran in the music
business. ``Wild World'' is included on ``Maxi,'' his third album
and the first to be released in the United States.
   He grew up in southeast London, the son of a factory worker, and
described his upbringing as ``a bit too strict.'' Priest did,
however, have a diverse musical background.
   ``Coming from the Pentacostal church, I liked a lot of religious
songs. Having a Jamaican West Indian background, I was into reggae.''
   His influences were broad, ranging from the sounds of Studio One
in Jamaica to the Beatles. Although not a born musician _ he does
not play an instrument _ Priest was singing ``roughly from the time
the doctor slapped my bum when I came out.'' He created his own
studio at the age of 14.
   He was still a teen-ager when he joined Saxon International as a
deejay for ``Sound System'' and worked with noted English reggae
stars such as Smiley Culture and Tippa Irie.
   ``I found myself getting a lot of ideas very quickly. A lot of my
vibes came from Sound System. You just start singing and things come
out. I found myself getting good melodies and good lyrics at the
same time,'' he said.
   In 1984, Priest's debut single, ``Hey Little Girl,'' became the
first British reggae record to reach No. 1 in Jamaica. The following
year, he released his first album, ``You're Safe,'' and after
extensive touring, was named best male vocalist in the 1986 UK
Reggae Awards.
   His second album, ``Intentions,'' came out in late 1986 and
contained a cover version of Van Morrison's ``Crazy Love.''
   ``It was given to me by my manager. I like Van Morrison's stuff.
I think he's a very good writer.''
   On ``Maxi,'' Priest covers ``Some Guys Have All the Luck,'' a hit
for Rod Stewart.
   ``It was a song that I always wanted to do. It always used to
work with me on stage. Once I was doing this TV program. There was a
commercial break and I started to sing the song and the crowd went
`Yeah.'''
   But Priest writes most of his own material.
   ``I don't want to be cut out as a cover artist. I'm not putting
it down, it was a good idea and it worked. But I do not want to be
known as a cover artist.
   ``I think most of my music comes from the early Studio One where
you had to have a good song, a good melody.''
   Priest is especially proud of ``How Can We Ease the Pain,'' an
original song on ``Maxi.''
   ``It means a lot to me. It's not being too political but it's
stating something the whole world need to understand. That we could
live a lot better than we're living. I don't like to get into any
heavy politics but it's just a nice way to say something.''
   He does deal more directly with politics on ``Marcus,'' a tribute
to the late black nationalist leader, Marcus Garvey.
   ``It's giving thanks to somebody that thought of the apartheid
movement many years ago.''
   Reggae's most famous rhythm section, drummer Sly Dunbar and
bassist Robbie Shakespeare, played on ``Maxi.''
   ``They heard a lot about me in England and I always heard about
them. It was inevitable somehwhere along the line,'' Priest said.
``It was fun. Like sitting back and saying, `Hey, this is Sly and
Robbie.'''
   Priest will begin a tour of the United States this fall. He feels
at ease performing live, crediting his confidence to the time spent
at Saxon International.
   ``You have to sing with people right into your face. So I had a
bit of experience dealing with people directly. It was easier on
stage.''
   Despite his following in England, Priest is well aware of the
difficulty that reggae artists have selling records in the United
States. Even Bob Marley had problems. His only song to make the Top
10 was ``I Shot the Sheriff,'' and that was a cover version by Eric
Clapton.
   ``I'm realizing that now,'' Priest said, ``but this is a new
generation. The music is looking much, much better. Bob opened the
doors. There's Steel Pulse, Aswad, Ziggy Marley.''
   But don't go looking for any ``Maxi Priest Sings Cat Stevens''
compilations. ``I'm not a fan of Cat Stevens,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mommy, Musician Come Together</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ginny Reilly has been both mommy and musician for
seven years, but mostly she's kept her babies and her B-flats
separate.
   No more. In her new album, ``Doodle Lee Do'in,'' Reilly follows
the course of motherhood, from a woman's yearning for a child to her
pregnancy to the joys and frustrations of being a parent.
   In a crystal-clear soprano, she sings a lullaby to the fetus
locked inside her womb, imploring the child not to be afraid to be
born:
   ``There'll be stars above
   ``And warm soft woolen gloves
   ``And someone new to love
   ``When you come out and play.''
   She criticizes an infant's manners: ``I feed you all the night
and day, You throw it back right into my face.'' But years later she
misses the travails of caring for a baby: ``There's nobody playing
with the knobs and dials, nobody giving me a toothless smile....''
   Reilly has always found her inspiration in her own life. In her
20s and early 30s, she says, ``I wrote a lot about sad love affairs.
I kind of ran out of ideas there, so I got married.''
   Then came her children _ Emily, 7, and Charlie, 5 _ the
inspiration for ``Doodle Lee Do'in.'' The album cover shows a
pregnant, seated Reilly with a Coke cup balanced on her distended
belly.
   Although there is a sweet sunniness to the album, Reilly does not
suggest that motherhood has been as easy as apple pie.
   ``In reality, motherhood has been a real challenge to me. It's
been hard,'' says the 42-year-old, Seattle-based singer.
   Between making beds, vacuuming the floors and picking up the
kids, her energy and creativity flagged. She had no time to write
music; the song ``Emily'' was composed entirely in her head, because
she ``just didn't have a second'' to sit down with a guitar.
   Nor did she sing to her babies. ``Charlie actually would begin to
cry when I sang to him,'' she said.
   Charlie may be adorable _ like his mother and sister, he has a
crop of orange hair _ but his taste in music is questionable. His
mother has been singing professionally since 1968, and has sung with
David Maloney since 1970.
   The duo, billed as Reilly & Maloney, has put out seven albums on
their own Freckle Records label, which is run by Reilly's husband,
Jack Burg. Though they have toured widely, they're most popular on
the West Coast.
   Reilly has made one other solo album, but had never considered a
collection of the motherhood songs she had written over the years.
On tour, she would sing one or two of the songs at each show.
   ``The nightclub people aren't too excited to hear all your baby
songs back to back,'' she says.
   Then, three years ago, she was asked to sing at a regional
convention of the International Childbirth Education Association.
She put together a program of appropriate songs, and they were well
received. Afterwards, members of the audience lined up to buy tapes
of her performance.
   ``First, I freaked out because they weren't supposed to be
selling my music. Then I thought, `Maybe there's some interest in
this,''' she said.
   It took a while to put the album together. Emily and Charlie
listened as she practiced songs about them, and they kept a close
tally of how many songs were about each child.
   Her album complete, Reilly thinks she knows why women have
produced few songs about pregnancy and motherhood: ``They've been
too busy doing it.''
   Even given the time, she says, such songs may not draw any
attention. ``The only real women's music you see these days is by
lesbians. I sometimes say I'm going to do an album called `Songs for
Neurotic, Heterosexual Women.' You have to be different and weird to
get any attention nowadays.''
   She will sing some of the songs when she and Maloney tour, as
they do about 100 days a year. Touring is tough, but not necessarily
because she is separated from her children.
   ``The hard thing is to make the switch between working and being
a housewife,'' she said. ``I get back into staying up late at night
to work, sleeping late in the morning, talking to adults all day,
reading _ that old life I used to live when I was younger.
   ``I get back here and WHAM, I walk into the house and there's
this whole other universe. It takes days to get used to it. I've
been back seven days now and I just today got around to vacuuming
the house.''

<HEAD>Prussian Nostalia in Journalist's Best Seller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 45 years after Russian tanks
rolled through East Prussia, one of West Germany's leading
journalists has produced a haunting memoir of an aristocratic and
tradition-bound world shattered by war.
   At the heart of Countess Marion Doenhoff's best seller,
``Childhood in East Prussia,'' is the chronicle of a proud East
Prussian family, which prospered there from the Middle Ages until
1945. It also details the family's loss to the German war machine
and the price it paid for resistance to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
   Doenhoff, who will be 79 on Dec. 2, is co-publisher of the
respected weekly newspaper Die Zeit. She shares the position with
former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
   One of West Germany's most respected journalists and political
commentators, she has been a firm advocate of improved relations
with eastern Europe and has worked for reconciliation with the
victims of Nazi aggression.
   Doenhoff's book comes 26 years after she detailed the family's
dramatic flight from the advancing Soviet army in a best-selling
book titled ``Forgotten Names.''
   East Prussia, once the home of vast and imposing noble estates
and the German military aristocracy, was divided into parcels after
World War II and ceded to Poland and the Soviet Union. It bordered
the Baltic on the north and Poland and Lithuania in the south and
east.
   ``Childhood in East Prussia'' is filled with memories of the
region's rustic landscape and the stern, but unostentatious habits
of Doenhoff's family, one of the region's oldest and a member of the
Kaiser's court in Berlin.
   She also describes distinguished visitors to the Doenhoff
family's Friedrichstein estate, located in the sprawling timber-rich
region near the city of Koenigsberg, now Kaliningrad in the Soviet
Union.
   Referring to a visit in 1916 by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg
to the family estate when she was a little girl, Doenhoff recalls
that she was disappointed by the legendary officer's appearance:
``He was tall and heavy and walked with a stiff gait. ... he did not
look like the godly hero I had imagined him to be.''
   As a teen-ager, she recalls exploring the family mansion's attic,
where she discovered the dusty records and long-forgotten
memorabilia of generations of Doenhoffs _ discoveries she says gave
her a sense of ``how far back my direct and formative past
stretches.''
   She also recounts the tragic fate of many of her relatives and
friends and her own brushes with death.
   Writing of preparations by East Prussian aristocrats who joined
together to plot the ill-fated July 20, 1944, assassination attempt
against Hitler, Doenhoff says: ``We were among one of the circles of
those sworn against Hitler. I was involved in some (local)
preparations, (my cousin) Heini Lehndorff with actions to carry it
out.''
   Lehndorff, who was to help assuming command of the Nazi garrison
in Koenigsberg, was later executed in Berlin along with hundreds of
other plotters and their sympathizers. A prominent local official
whom she had won over to the side of the conspirators was also
killed.
   ``I anguished for a long time over why he had been killed and I
was only questioned by the Gestapo,'' Doenhoff writes.
   Later, she learned that the man's name was on a captured list of
those who were to take over local positions of power after Hitler's
assassination.
   Doenhoff writes that Hitler's war also took a terrible toll on
the sons of East Prussia's aristocracy, many of whom fell in the
Soviet Union.
   Thousands of civilians were also killed as Russian troops
advanced.
   The Doenhoff estate, built in the 18th century, was burned to the
ground in 1945 by Russian soldiers, Doenhoff says. Three of her
nephews were killed in battle in Russia, as was a brother.
   The coming war and the region's ultimate destruction and loss,
was often the subject of grim humor among the family, as they
renovated buildings and modernized the estate's agricultural
production.
   ``We used to say, `The Russians will be pleased with the
improvements,''' Doenhoff writes. ``Long before 1939 we sensed that
this insane war would come and the Russians would be the inheritors
of our labors.''
   Extensive restoration efforts on the estate were completed just
before it was destroyed.
   It took decades for Doenhoff to finally accept that her homeland
was lost forever. ``For years I hoped that a miracle would happen,
although my political studies had proved that there could be no
miracles in this area.''
   The realities of post-war politics and the importance of
improving relations with eastern Europe forced her to accept its
irrevocable loss.
   ``If we wanted normalization, we needed clarity over the final
borders,'' Doenhoff said.
   The parcels ceded to the Soviet Union and Poland after the war
were made permanent in treaties ratified between 1970 and 1972 as
part of efforts by the West German government to pursue an active
rapproachment, or ``Ostpolitik,'' with the Soviet bloc.
   Despite recognition of the political necessities regarding East
Prussia, Doenhoff says the emotional legacy remains.
   ``Even today, after living happily in Hamburg for decades, I
answer `East Prussia' instinctively and without thinking when asked
where my home is. I miss the landscape ... of this lost land.''

<HEAD>Now Is A Bad Time For Weak Hearts To Buy _ Or Sell _ Insurance
Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For small investors, the best thing to do about
the turmoil in the California insurance industry is to sit still. At
least for now.
   The outcome of the battle over the rate-reducing Proposition 103
in California is too uncertain to permit informed speculation about
which way the stocks of the insurers are headed, analysts say.
   ``Our strategy right now is if you own, do nothing. There will be
better opportunities later on the speculative side,'' said Carol
Manning, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``The uncertainty is so strong that you can't assess who
ultimately will be most adversely affected. You also cannot at this
point in time assess the companies that will take advantage of
whatever opportunities will develop from the change in the law,''
Ms. Manning said.
   ``Once we begin to know what rules will prevail, then you can
begin to make assessments as to what companies will be either
adversely or positively affected,'' she said.
   Proposition 103, which was approved by California voters this
past week, requires an immediate reduction of at least 20 percent in
property and casualty insurance rates, including auto rates,
throughout the state.
   At first it would seem that such a proposition would knock the
legs out from under the stocks of companies that do a lot of
business in California. That has not happened, for two reasons:
   1. Passage of Prop 103 was widely expected, and almost anyone who
wanted to sell did so well in advance.
   2. Because of legal challenges and action in the state
legislature, Prop 103 may never go into effect, although some kind
of rate relief is almost certain.
   Consider Mercury General Corp., a Los Angeles-based auto insurer
that has publicly said that Proposition 103, if it took effect,
would force the company out of business.
   So what happened on Tuesday, when California voters trooped to
the polls to pass the proposition? The stock rose 50 cents a share
in over-the-counter trading.
   The stock backed off 12{ cents a share on Wednesday. But it shot
up $1.12{ to $14.62{ on Thursday, after the California Supreme Court
temporarily stayed the proposition to allow time for a review of its
constitutionality.
   In short, an investor who got cold feet and sold at Monday's
closing price would have missed out on an 11 percent profit in just
three days. Anyone who wanted to get out should have done so back in
early 1987, when Mercury General touched $25 a share.
   Besides Mercury General, other insurers who get the bulk of their
revenue from the California market include 20th Century Industries
Inc. and Zenith National Insurance Corp.
   Fireman's Fund Insurance Cos. and Ohio Casualty Insurance Co. get
about a quarter of their revenue from California, Ms. Manning
estimates.
   At the other extreme is U.S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co. _ known as
USF&G _ which counts on California for less than 5 percent of its
premiums. The slight exposure to California is one reason Ms.
Manning recommends the stock.
   Most analysts say voters in other states will not rush to enact
their own Proposition 103s when they see the turmoil generated by
California's, including the number of insurers that say they will
stop doing business in the state.
   For the insurance companies, the ideal solution would be
legislative and judicial reforms that would discourage frivolous
litigation and fat jury awards. With reforms in place, they could
afford to roll back rates and still stay in business.
   ``What happens from here is the $64 question,'' said John Snyder,
an assistant vice president at Firemark Insurance Research, an
investment banking and research firm in Parsippany, N.J.
   ``It's a very sensitive time for the stocks,'' he said.

Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Africanized bees have a nasty temper and a
killer reputation, but Agriculture Department experts say a small
parasite carried by the bees may present the biggest problem to the
American farm scene.
   Hachiro Shimanuki, a microbiologist at the USDA beneficial
insects laboratory in Beltsville, Md., said the Africanized bees are
known carriers of a devastating bee mite called the varroa Jacobsoni.
   ``This mite is particularly harmful,'' said Shimanuki. ``It can
quickly infect a hive and it kills the brood of the honey bee and
reduces the life of the adult bee.''
   Shimanuki said mites have been found in at least two swarms of
Africanized bees, popularly known as killer bees, accidently brought
to the U.S. by ship. And the mite is common among Africanized swarms
in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Uraguay.
   One mite-infected swarm was carried by a ship up the St. Lawrence
Seaway and discovered in Illinois. Another was found last year
aboard a ship that docked in Florida, said Shimaunki.
   ``The major concern with the mite is that it could force states
to restrict the movement of bee hives in this country,'' said the
scientist.
   Bee hives are critical to the pollenation of cranberries and
blueberries in the Northeast and to almonds and alfalfa seeds in
California. Other crops are assisted in pollenation by domestic bee
hives. Bee keepers in Florida and Texas annually haul thousands of
hives to the northern states during the crop flowering season to
help the plants make fruit.
   Without the bees, said Shimaunki, production would definitely
decline.
   ``There are native pollenators in the areas, but the farmers
can't count on them,'' he said. ``Farmers will use bee hive
pollenators as insurance.''
   Shimanuki said there is a real concern that the Africanized bees,
now slowly moving northward in Mexico and expected to reach Texas by
1990, will bring in a huge population of the mites that could wipe
out many domestic hives.
   Mite infestations in Florida and Texas could force states not
infected to restrict the movement of bee hives, thus depriving some
northern crops of critical pollenation services, said Shimanuki.
   USDA bee experts are monitoring every swarm of Africanized bees
found in the U.S. and checking for the presence of the mites. A
swarm was found Oct. 31 on a ship docked in Gainesville, Fla., and
three others have been found on ships in Florida over the last two
years. The swarms are destroyed and samples sent to the USDA
laboratory in Beltsville.
   Shimanuki said the USDA also is monitoring the natural northward
migration of the Africanized bees through the use of traps located
in Mexico and along the Texas border.
   African bees were brought to Brazil more than 30 years ago by bee
experts who hoped to increase honey production through a
cross-breeding program. In 1957, some of the African queen bees were
released in Brazil and hybrid descendants have been moving northward
since.
   Shimanuki said the Africanized bees are slightly smaller than the
European bees used by domestic bee keepers. But the essential
difference between the two is in temper and territorial defense.
   European bees are calm and not easily motivated to attack.
   ``You could safely sit on their hive,'' said Shimanuki.
   Africanized bees, however, sense threats everywhere. For example,
he said, the vibration of a distant tractor could agitate an African
swarm into attacking any animal or human within a quarter mile of
the hive.
   And once the attack starts, the African bees will sting more
persistently and in greater numbers than domestic bees.
   Africanized bees easily mix and cross-breed with domestic bees,
often passing along their dangerous tendencies.
   As a result, Shimanuki said Africanized bees may wipe out a
thriving backyard bee industry in the United States. Part-time
beekeepers who now can keep hives in semi-rural areas may have to
end the practice if their hives become Africanized, he said.
   ``There is a real liability concern,'' said Shimanuki. ``The
location of where you could have hives would be much more limited.''
   Beekeeping to make honey and to provide pollenation services is
now a $20 billion business in the United States, and Africanized
bees and the mite they carry pose at real threat to the industry, he
said.

   Early on Election Day, sudden panic swept
through the top echelon of the George Bush campaign as overnight
tracking polls suggested a 8-10 point lead sustained for a week
might be collapsing.
   Suddenly Bush strategists began wringing their hands and seeing a
new vulnerability that, as it turned out, wasn't really there.
   The nervousness in the final hours might have been expected in a
campaign that many political analysts now point to as a textbook
example of state-of-the-art sophistication in political showmanship.
   And, although former Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., has scoffed
at a campaign ``run by Madison Avenue,'' Bush strategists point to
these techniques as an important factor in Bush's victory.
   Some examples:
   _ Constant polling by Bush pollster Robert Teeter, involving no
fewer than 1,000 calls each night, was used extensively to guide
Bush's itinerary, enabling him get the most political bang from each
appearance.
   _ Careful early-on efforts to shore up support in the vice
president's base of support in the South and the Far West gave him
the luxury of not having to spend time in these areas in the crucial
closing days.
   _ Advanced facsimile and other commnications equipment aboard Air
Force Two enabled campaign chairman James A. Baker III to call the
shots from his fully-staffed, well-equipped headquarters in
Washington. Virtually no decisions were made on the road.
   _ All aspects of the campaign were cooridanted in advance. Stump
speeches were designed to look good on television. Themes were
repeated for days, even weeks. Television advertising buys were
timed to back up the themes.
   _ Ads and various attack lines were auditioned first before
bipartisan ``focus groups'' of human guinea pigs. Bush's repeated
taunting of rival Michael Dukakis on the Pledge of Allegiance and on
Massachusetts prison furloughs grew out of such sessions.
   But such carefully laid plans didn't keep momentary panic from
setting in as Bush aides watched the early _ and unreliable _
polling data that showed his edge over Dukakis may have slipped to 4
percent or less.
   Bush recalled he was being bombarded by conflicting words from
top aidess, some telling him ``these exit polls don't mean a thing''
and others arguing, ``but wait a second.''
   ``The early count was this, the later count was something else.
All of that adds to the nervous tension,'' the president-elect told
reporters on his trip back to Washington on Wednesday from Houston.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, says that the race was
always much closer than polls of any given day might have suggested.
   ``The brutal fact that all Republicans are aware of is that there
are more Democrats in the country than Republicans,'' Atwater said,
meaning the victory of Bush or any other GOP presidential candidate
depended upon Democrtic votes.
   ``Two things got us where we are: the vice president's acceptance
speech and the second debate,'' Atwater said.
   And, he added, ``our ability to checkmate what they were doing.''
   Dukakis' team made several crucial errors, Atwater and other Bush
strategists contend: failure to react quickly enough to Bush's
attacks; a period of wallowing in late summer due to a misreading of
public sentiment toward GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle;
and developing their best shot, Dukakis' populist ``I am on your
side'' theme, too late in the campaign for it to be effective.
   Analysts of both parties claim Bush's carefully crafted
acceptance speech at the GOP convention in August helped him emerge
forcefully from the shadow of President Reagan.
   At the same time, analysts suggest, Bush's lyrical appeal for a
``kinder, gentler nation'' and his emphasis on day-care and other
family problems helped him build support where he most needed it,
among women voters.
   Dukakis was ``flat footed when Bush agressively went on the
attack,'' said Norman Ornstein, a political analyst with the
conservative American Enterprise Institute.
   Bob Beckel, who was 1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale's
campaign manager, said: ``Bush and his people made a much faster
transition from the primary to the general election than did the
Dukakis campaign.''
   And David Garth, a Democratic consultant who was an adviser to
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said Dukakis' early surge in the
polls was a false one, due mostly to his defeat of rival Jesse
Jackson.
   ``He never got rid of Jackson or put him in perspective,'' Garth
said.
   Nearly all analysts also point to two of Bush's biggest campaign
assets: the state of the U.S. economy, with the nation in the sixth
year of a record peactime expansion; and to a lesser degree, the
continued popularity of Reagan, to whom Bush emerged as the clear
heir apparent by knocking off a full field of GOP rivals early in
the primary season.

   He's a singer, songwriter, actor, activist,
ecologist and aspiring space traveler. But what John Denver really
wants to be right now is heard on the radio again.
   ``We always had to struggle to get my records on the air. But
when we did, I had incredible success,'' he said in an interview
here at the start of his American tour. ``One of the problems I've
always had _ even at the height of my career _ was that I was never
a radio darling. I didn't have the hype going that a lot of rock
singers had. That mystique was just not part of what I was doing.
   ``The format at a lot of the stations now is not the kind of
songs or kind of sound I'm doing. I still like to use a real
orchestra, not a synthesizer or a drum machine. Real people, live
music. But that's not what's going on out there right now.''
   The 44-year-old Denver is out with a new album _ ``Higher
Ground'' _ on his own label, Windstar. The LP is being distrubuted
by Allegiance Records of Hollywood, Calif. Denver left RCA Records
after 25 albums, 13 of which went gold and eight platinum in the
U.S. alone.
   His easy-listening, country-crossover style made a string of hit
singles in the 1970s: ``Rocky Mountain High,'' ``Sunshine on My
Shoulder,'' ``Back Home Again,'' ``Annie's Song,'' ``Take Me Home,
Country Road'' and ``Thank God I'm a Country Boy.'' His greatest
hits LP still ranks as the best-selling album in RCA history.
   ``They really took me for granted,'' Denver said. ``I was one of
the few artists on the label and I probably had the best contract
they had and I was in the black. At the time I delivered my last
album (`One World' in 1986), RCA had just been sold to General
Electric and I was in line for a new contract. I had every right to
expect as good a contract as I had, if not better.
   ``But the new management wanted to show a profit quickly and it
was more than they wanted to spend. RCA's promotional people never
supported me anyway. Radio was resistent to me and I was a hard
sell, so why bother?
   ``One of the reasons for establishing my own label was to have
the clout and the budget to say, `This is what I want t be done' and
get this record on the air.''
   The new LP is in the same vein as Denver's others. It's heavy on
love ballads _ ``For You,'' ``Never a Doubt'' and ``Whispering
Jesse''.
   ``I'm a hopeless romantic,'' said Denver, who in August married
Australian singer Cassandra Delaney.
   Other cuts mix Denver's vocals and acoustic guitar work with his
usual introspective lyrics (``Higher Ground,'' ``All This Joy,''
``Country Girl in Paris'') while other songs are for causes _ ``Sing
Australia'' written for Australia's bicentennial, ``Bread & Roses''
for the feminist movement and ``Fallen Leaves (The Refugees)'' for
the world's homeless.
   Denver has traveled the globe for concerts and benefits in his
20-year career. He visited Africa in 1985 to call attention to the
hunger problem and did fund-raising shows in 1987 for the victims of
the Chernobyl nuclear power accident in the Soviet Union. In 1976,
he helped establish the Snowmass, Colo.-based Windstar Foundation,
which is working toward world peace and world ecology.
   ``One of the problems in the world today is most of us think the
problems or the bureaucracies are so great that we can't make a
difference,'' he said. ``I want to prove that to be inaccurate. I
want to demonstrate that an individual can make a difference.''
   Born John Deutschendorf in Roswell, N.M., and raised in Oklahoma,
Arizona and Texas as an Air Force brat, Denver moved to Los Angeles
to be a folk musician and wrote the mega-hit ``Leavin' on a Jet
Plane'' in 1969.
   He now is a licensed jet pilot and said he has longed for space
travel since he was 10 years old, when he looked up at the stars one
night and ``was just enthralled with wonder of what was up there.''
   Denver was instrumental in the start of the Citizens for Space
program and even volunteered to be the first to go.
   Now that NASA has decided to put the citizen's program on hold
following the ill-fated Challenger mission two years ago, Denver had
considered going on a Soviet flight in December 1989. However, he
missed the Nov. 1 deadline and balked at the $10 million price he
said the Soviets wanted him to pay.
   ``I'm not willing to pay that. It's not ethical and it makes it
look like whoever can come up with $10 million can fly in space.
   ``I don't want this to look like a stunt. I want to do something
up there. I'd like to do a radio program for the week I'm up there
for children all over the world and also host a television show.''
   Denver, best remembered on the silver screen for his role in ``Oh
God!,'' recently starred in a summer TV movie called ``Higher
Ground'' about an Alaskan bush pilot.
   Plans for a series were scrapped so Denver could embark on his
current ``Songs of the Future, Songs Of the Past'' concert tour
which began Oct. 5 at Arizona State University and will criss-cross
the country through Dec. 18.
   ``Life is really going great for me now,'' Denver said. ``I feel
great about the quality of work I'm doing and the way the record's
being received. I just got married again. I'm 44 and it's like I'm
starting all over again. I've never been happier.''

   Wholesale price inflation slowed to zero last
month as food costs dropped for the first time since February, the
Labor Department says.
   The drop in food prices, 0.1 percent at the wholesale level,
reflects an easing of the effects of the summer drought, analysts
said Thursday.
   Including energy and other products, wholesale prices overall are
only 2.9 percent higher than a year ago. Consumer prices have risen
about 4.5 percent.

   The Reagan administration is projecting that
the federal budget deficit in fiscal 1990 deficit will be $132
billion, up $21 billion from its forecast of three months ago.
   The projection made Thursday is $32 billion over the limit set by
the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law. To comply with the law, the
incoming administration of president-elect George Bush will have to
come up with $32 billion in spending cuts or face the prospect of
raising taxes.
   The deficit climbed to $155.1 billion in the fiscal year ended
Sept. 30 and could top $160 billion this year, many economists say.

<HEAD>Producer Prices Flat, Housing Prices Stall in Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of wholesale goods and housing in the Northeast are
showing some temporary improvement, according to two new reports.
   The government said Thursday in its regular monthly report on
producer prices that wholesale inflation slowed to zero in October
as food costs dropped for the first time since February.
   Fresh-fruit prices fell 9.2 percent to lead a 0.1 percent decline
in food prices, reflecting an easing of the effects of the summer
drought, the Labor Department reported.
   Food prices had been climbing at an annual rate of 8 percent
before the reversal, which appeared to buck the latest trend of
government reports showing strong growth in the economy.
   But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the report.
They said consumers can expect a second round of drought-related
increases next spring when shortages of meat and pork appear because
of earlier-than-normal slaughters this year.
   ``It's just temporary,'' said Michael Evans, who runs a private
economic forecasting firm in Washington. ``Next year we'll see the
lag effects of the drought and food prices will be up sharply
again.''
   Energy prices rose a slight 0.3 percent in October as a 4.6
percent increase in natural gas prices caused primarily by shortages
in the Northeast was offset by a 10.1 percent decline in home
heating oil prices and no change in gasoline prices.
   The housing market report from the National Association of
Realtors said home prices continue soaring in California, but
appreciation rates in the once red-hot markets of New York, Boston
and Hartford, Conn., were below the national average in the third
quarter. The median price in Philadelphia actually fell by 3.5
percent.
   Home prices in the New York metropolitan area, including Long
Island and northern New Jersey, rose to $192,600 in the quarter, up
1.2 percent from the same period a year earlier.
   Prices were up 1.0 percent in Boston to a median of $184,100,
meaning half of the homes sold for more and half for less.
   Nationally, the third-quarter median resale price for
single-family homes was $90,200, up 3.9 percent from a year earlier.
   The financial markets showed little change Thursday, but worries
persisted about the dollar and how President-elect George Bush will
deal with the U.S. trade and budget deficits.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which had fallen
9.25 points Wednesday after Bush's victory, declined 3.55 to close
at 2,114.69.
   The dollar finished unchanged against the Japanese yen but lower
against other major currencies in foreign exchange trading.
   Bond prices, which had been hurt by the dollar's recent weakness,
improved as rumors surfaced late in the day that the central banks
of the major industrial powers might increase their support for the
dollar by coordinating their purchases of the currency on the open
market.

<HEAD>Growing Trade Surplus, Currency Fluctuations Await Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush may avoid the worst of the trade
friction that has plagued U.S.-Japan relations during the Reagan
administration, but the huge trade imbalance and currency
fluctuations will remain major issues in the next four years.
   Trade figures released Thursday showed Japan's surplus with the
United States declined less than expected in October, falling 3
percent to $4.83 billion from $4.98 billion a year earlier. It was
the 10th straight monthly decline.
   Japan's overall trade surplus rose 13 percent to $7.69 billion
from $8.85 billion a year earlier.
   October's marginal decline in the bilateral trade surplus is an
indication the trade imbalance is proving more stubborn than had
been expected, said Peter Morgan, chief economist at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Securities Japan Ltd.
   ``There's some question of how sustainable the decline is. We
were actually looking for a faster rate of improvement, but it's not
coming through,'' Morgan said.
   Although lower oil prices are a major factor depressing growth in
the value of Japan's imports and hence contributing to the
ballooning trade surplus, overall imports are weak relative to
Japan's strong domestic economic growth.
   If the U.S. trade deficit does not shrink quickly enough, there
will be heavy pressure in the United States to drive the dollar down
further against the Japanese yen and West German mark, Morgan said.
   Japan has successfully weathered retaliatory U.S. trade sanctions
and the impact of the yen's appreciation against the dollar on its
exports, fueling economic growth with domestic economic demand. But
wild fluctuations in currency exchange rates could destabilize even
the robust Japanese economy, analysts say.
   Japanese business and government officials expressed confidence
following the election that the Bush victory was a welcome sign of
continuity.
   ``We don't distinguish between Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
They are working toward this noble cause (U.S.-Japan ties) as a
team. There is no reason to think (Bush) would be acting differently
from Mr. Reagan,'' said Yukio Okamoto, director of the Foreign
Ministry's First North America Division.
   The new U.S. trade act directs the new president to restrict
imports from nations that accumulate trade surpluses because of what
he deems unfair trade practices.
   Nevertheless, Bush's support for free trade _ ``We need to
increase our exports, not shut our borders,'' he has said _ has
reassured Tokyo.
   Bush advisers have said the president-elect feels new policies
are needed to cope with changing global economic patterns.
   ``That means, with our allies, to develop a system which will
replace the kind of trade, economic and monetary system put in place
by the Bretton Woods conference (of 1944), dominated by the dollar
in the post-war world, which has collapsed...'' said Gen. Brent
Scowcroft, foreign policy adviser to the Bush campaign.
   In addition to improving trade, Japanese leaders would like to
see the United States trim its federal budget deficit.
   ``Reagan left the problem of huge fiscal and trade deficits. The
Bush administration will have to pay back his debts,'' stated an
editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper.

<HEAD>Time Plans Expansion To Survive Wave of Media Consolidations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. hopes to enlarge its already
substantial entertainment and television operations and plans to
expand aggressively outside the United States to assure its place
among the global media giants in the mid-1990s.
   J. Richard Munro, chairman and chief executive, and N.J. Nicholas
Jr., president, told financial analysts Thursday that potential
acquisitions or partnerships could include movie or programming
production companies, television networks, cable operations or
publishing concerns.
   They refused to be more specific, but Munro cautioned that Time's
interest in making deals ``doesn't mean we are going to jump at
whatever junk food comes along.''
   Media analyst Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell said
Time appeared to be ``laying out their plans for us, but I don't
sense that anything is in fact imminent.''
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Time rose $1 a share
to $105.50.
   Munro said recent foreign takeovers of big U.S. media companies
indicate foreigners ``are playing a worldwide game'' that Americans
must join or find themselves in second place.
   Among recent buyouts were Australian-based News Corp.'s $3
billion acquisition of Triangle Publications, publisher of TV Guide,
and British publisher Robert Maxwell's $2.6 billion purchase of
Macmillan Inc.
   Munro said that by the mid-1990s, the media and entertainment
industry will be composed of a limited number of global giants.
   ``Some will be European, some Asian, the rest American ... Time
Inc. intends to be one of these companies,'' he said.
   Nicholas said Time is looking for companies with a high return
or, absent that, a major strategic benefit for Time.
   Munro said the dollar's decline has helped foreign companies bid
successfully for U.S. media concerns. He said regulatory changes
over the next three years that will permit television networks to
own cable systems and to own and syndicate their own productions
also should encourage consolidation.
   ``Every player in the media-entertainment business _ at least
every smart one _ will be trying to do the same thing: to build
enterprises that can lay off the risk of increased production costs
over as many worldwide distribution systems as possible,'' he said.
   Time, the biggest U.S. magazine publisher, already has an
interest in cable television through its 80 percent ownership of
American Television and Communications Corp. the nation's second
largest cable operator. It is involved in programming through its
Home Box Office Inc., the pay television network.
   Time reportedly was in failed merger talks earlier this year with
Warner Communications Inc., the entertainment giant with interests
in film making and cable operations.
   Both Munro and Nicholas said they could not comment on those
reports.
   Nicholas said Time had no intention of selling its Scott,
Foresman & Co. educational publishing unit, which reportedly was on
the block earlier this year. He said it offers international
expansion possibilities.
   In mid-September, Time's stock ran up sharply on speculation that
it was considering a leveraged buyout or a restructuring.
   Munro did not directly address that matter, but told the analysts
that Time's management and board ``don't regard this as just another
media company to be leveraged or dismantled in the interests of
short-term gain.''

   Despite court challenges in two states,
Pillsbury Co.'s ``poison pill'' continues to be a potent defense
against a $5.23 billion takeover bid from Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC.
   Hennepin County District Court Judge Thomas Carey on Thursday
rejected a request from dissident shareholders to block the takeover
defense and said no to their request to force Pillsbury to discuss
Grand Met's $60-a-share tender offer.
   But after hearing from the shareholders that Pillsbury's board
was engaging in ``unlawful entrenchment'' by spurning the suitor,
Carey urged the food and restaurant company to sit down and talk
with Grand Met.
   Said Larry Commers, a lawyer for Grand Met: ``It's a step in the
right direction.''
   Pillsbury stock closed up 12{ cents Thursday at $58.62{ per share
in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Pillsbury's board of directors on Oct. 17 rejected the tender
offer as inadequate and on Monday offered shareholders the
alternative of a special dividend and stock in Burger King, which
would be spun off as a separate public company. Pillsbury Chairman
Philip Smith also said further moves to enhance shareholder value
are under consideration.
   Jack Chestnut, a lawyer representing shareholders in a
class-action suit, said the deal proposed by Pillsbury so far would
be worth only about $43 a share. Leaving the pill intact stifles
Grand Met's all-cash offer, which could be withdrawn, he said.
   ``Now is the time to put a deal on the table,'' Chestnut said.
``What harm is there, your honor, really, in forcing these two
corporate behemoths to sit down and negotiate?''
   Grand Met has said the pill makes the cost of a takeover
prohibitive and has sued in Delaware Chancery Court to have it
lifted. That request was denied Monday by retired Justice William
Duffy, who ruled that as of Oct. 17, Pillsbury's directors had not
abdicated their responsibility to shareholders in rejecting Grand
Met's offer as inadequate.
   Carey said Pillsbury's board has been diligent in its handling of
the takeover bid, but he restrained the company from raising legal
issues such as state ``tied-house'' statutes to impede possible
negotiations.
   Pillsbury has sued Grand Met in 14 states on grounds that a
takeover would violate those laws, which forbid liquor distillers
from selling alcohol at retail outlets.
   Grand Met, a liquor, gambling and franchise conglomerate, has
said it would sell the full-service restaurants owned by Pillsbury
if the takeover succeeds.
   Steven Rothschild, an attorney for Pillsbury, said Pillsbury's
board has an obligation to keep the poison pill in place in the face
of an inadequate offer. He said Grand Met's own financial advisers
have said the value of Pillsbury stock is more than $60 a share.
   Under the ``poison pill,'' or shareholders' rights plan,
Pillsbury shareholders could buy stock in the company at half price
should a hostile suitor acquire 20 percent of Pillsbury shares. For
Grand Met it could increase the cost of a takeover to $20 billion.
   Nearly 75 percent of the outstanding Pillsbury shares have been
tendered to Grand Met, which has extended the expiration date for a
second time to Nov. 14.
   Chestnut claimed Pillsbury shareholders stand to lose more than
$1 billion if Grand Met withdraws its offer.
   Separately, Pillsbury filed suit in Washington, D.C., to
invalidate a Maritime Administration decision approving the
ownership transfer to Grand Met's parent, Wendell Investment, of 61
barges and tugboats owned by a Pillsbury subsidiary.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, alleged the agency
violated procedures in approving the transfer of American-owned
vessels to a foreign buyer if Wendell and Grand Met take over
Pillsbury.

   Specialty steelmaker Allegheny Ludlum Corp.
says it will share its surge of profits with shareholders and
employees as it plans for a management change and an acquisition.
   ``1988 is a year that is unique in the 35 years that I've been in
specialty steel,'' said Richard Simmons, chairman and chief
executive.
   Simmons on Thursday announced a special cash dividend of $3.50
per share and a boost in the regular quarterly dividend from 12
cents to 25 cents per share.
   With 22.75 million shares outstanding, the moves will cost about
$85 million.
   The Pittsburgh-based maker of stainless steel sheet and strip and
electrical steels also will pay $6 million as a 4 percent
discretionary bonus to employees. Further profit sharing payouts are
expected through 1990, he said.
   Simmons, meanwhile, said he will step down as chief excutive in
18 months and has recommended the board elect Robert P. Bozzone as
chief executive until Bazzone's planned retirement less than five
years from now. Simmons, 57, has headed the company since 1972.
   Because the exit of Simmons and Bozzone would leave the company
with only one officer who has been in place more than two years,
Allegheny Ludlum is bringing in Arthur Aronson, Lukens Steel Co.
president and chief operating officer, as executive vice president.
   The Allegheny Ludlum board also authorized investing $25 million
in a leveraged buyout fund that will seek acquisitions of $100
million or less.
   Simmons' son, Brian, 28, is among the general partners of the
firm forming the fund. The chairman said he did not participate in
the negotiations and the voting on the investment to avoid any
conflict of interest.
   ``We're particularly sensitive to that issue,'' Simmons said.
``For that reason outside directors have been responsible and have
made most of the decisions with regard to this.''
   Despite the new spending and a $150 million capital investment
plan previously announced, Allegheny Ludlum still will have cash in
excess of its debt, Simmons said. Debt totals about $82 million and
cash about $90 million.
   Allegheny Ludlum reported profits of $85 million, or $3.76 per
share, on sales of $913.2 million for the first nine months of the
year, compared to profits of $35.5 million, or $1.81 per share, on
sales of $632 million in the 1987 period.

<HEAD>AMD Announces Layoffs Amid Other Signs of Weakening Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Further signs of a weakening
semiconductor industry have surfaced with the announcement that
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will lay off up to 1,000 workers because
of fewer orders from personal computer makers.
   And W.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive officer of
AMD, on Thursday characterized prospects for immediate improvement
in his company as bleak.
   ``Based on current order levels, we expect sales to decline in
the fourth quarter and foresee no material improvement in the
immediate future,'' Sanders said.
   The layoff announcement came on the heels of monthly figures by
the Semiconductor Industry Association showing a 21.6 percent
decline in shipments by semiconductor manufacturers worldwide to
U.S. customers in October, the biggest decline in 13 years.
   Furthermore, the association's book-to-bill ratio of 0.92 for
October, released Wednesday, was the lowest since 1986, and a 9
percent decrease from 0.97 in September.
   Industry analyst Michael Gumport of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
in New York the drop the largest montly decline on record.
   ``It's definitely heading south. It's not a very good report,''
said John Girton, vice president of research at Van Kasper & Co. in
San Francisco.
   But a number of analysts said they did not expect the industry to
go into a major tailspin.
   ``I still think we're looking at the worst of the news now,''
said Gumport.
   The high-tech industry research firm Dataquest Inc. in San Jose
recently predicted moderate industry growth in 1989 followed by
improved sales. That would follow expected industry dollar growth of
35.8 percent in 1988.
   Advanced Micro Devices, the nation's fifth-largest computer chip
maker, recently laid off 1,400 workers in Malaysia and the
Philippines after an expected summer pickup in sales failed to
materialize.
   The company announced Thursday it will cut employees from all
four of its domestic manufacturing plants, located in Sunnyvale and
Santa Clara in California and Austin and San Antonio in Texas, but
most cuts will be made in the San Francisco area, said spokesman
John Greenagel.
   The cuts will occur in areas where entire projects will be phased
out, he said.
   ``We are eliminating certain programs that are not promising...in
order to concentrate on resources and on growth markets,'' said
Greenagel, who would not comment on which programs would be cut.
   Company officials blamed the reduction on weakening demand for
integrated circuits from personal computer customers, including
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Apple Inc.
   Michael Stark, an industry analyst at Robertson, Colman &
Stephens, of San Francisco, said the layoffs indicate the company's
troubles have been compounded by its difficulty in making memory
chips with advanced manufacturing processes already mastered by
competitors.
   The company employs about 5,500 people in the Bay area and 3,000
people in Texas. Worldwide, AMD employs about 15,800 workers and is
the largest company in the world exclusively manufacturing
integrated circuits.
   During 1987, AMD recorded $997 million in sales and lost $48
million. The company recorded $53 million in profits during the
first nine months of this year, but expects to lose money during the
fourth quarter, officials said.
   The SIA's figures showed that U.S., Japanese and European chip
makers had shipped $1.02 billion in chips to U.S. customers in
October, compared to $1.3 billion in September.
   The SIA's book-to-bill ratio of 0.92 for October means that chip
makers received $92 worth of new orders from U.S. customers for
every $100 worth of chips shipped.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Sharply In Active European Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply in active European trading
today before the Bank of England reportedly stepped in to buy
dollars late in the morning. Gold prices were higher.
   The dollar fell to a 10-month low against the Japanese yen and to
five-month lows against the West German mark and the British pound
before the Bank of England reportedly started buying dollars and
selling yen on behalf of the Bank of Japan at about 11 a.m..
   Foreign exchange dealers expressed surprise that other major
European central banks had not entered the market to boost the
dollar.
   Dealers said the Japanese central bank intervened in Singapore
after the Tokyo session ended today, buying dollars after the dollar
fell below 123 yen, dealers said.
   The West German Bundesbank might wait until next week before
intervening to support the dollar, a Milan trader said. He argued
that the absence of many traders due to a holiday in several
European countries meant any dollar buying by central banks on the
open market would have less ``psychological effect.''
   However, another Milan trader said the dollar may have bottomed
out and could rebound later in Friday's session.
   ``I can't believe that the dollar can keep falling every day,''
the trader said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 123.70 yen. Later, in London,
it fell further to 122.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.7365 West German marks, down from 1.7565; 1.4595
Swiss francs, down from 1.4765; 5.9335 French francs, down from
6.0065; 1.9615 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9825; 1,296.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,311.00; and 1.2230 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2246.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8135 from $1.7970
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $419 a troy ounce, down
from $419.75 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $420.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $420.80, up from $419.70 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.18 to close at a bid of
$421.05.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.40 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $6.48.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Soars On Tokyo Market, Hit High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices soared across the board on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today, pushing the main price index to a record high while
the U.S. dollar hit a 10-month low against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the most widely
followed price index of the exchange, rose 323.15 points, or 1.15
percent, to close at a new high of 28,489.57. The previous record of
28,423.38 was set Aug. 5.
   The dollar closed at 123.70 yen, after opening at 123.80 yen and
moving in a narrow range of 123.63-123.88 yen. The U.S. currency had
closed in Tokyo Thursday at 124.10 yen.
   Securities dealers attributed the sharp gain on the stock market
to generally bullish market sentiments. The market is viewing lower
oil prices and the strong yen favorably, they said.
   ``Institutional investors and trust fund managers seem to start
participating in the market again,'' said Keiichi Nishida, a dealer
at Kidder Peabody's Tokyo office. ``Also the fact the we have not
heard bad news on the emperor's condition in the past three days is
helping share prices rise.''
   The condition of Japan's Emperor Hirohito, who has been bedridden
since Sept. 19, took a sudden turn for the worse Tuesday and share
prices tumbled on the Tokyo market the following day. But he has
been reported stable since then.
   On the foreign exchange market, dealers said the dollar's decline
reflects the market's general sentiment toward the currency.
   It was the lowest value for the U.S. currency against the yen
since it hit 121.65 yen Jan. 4.
   ``The dollar could have gone lower if the Bank of Japan did not
prop it up,'' said an exchange dealer at a major U.S. commercial
bank in Tokyo.
   He said the central bank intervened moderately in the market
today when the dollar was trading at around 123.70 yen. Other
dealers said the Bank of Japan's intervention was considerable, to
the tune of 400 million dollars.
   ``It is unlikely that we'll see the dollar go below 123.50 yen at
this point,'' he said.

<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The selection of a Texas site to build the superconducting super
collider effectively ends the race among 25 states to capture the
economic benefits tied to construction of the massive project. Here
is a summary of the economics of the super collider:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BUILDING COST: The Energy Department estimates the collider will
cost $4.4 billion. The Congressional Budget Office said it could
take $6.4 billion if costs follow the pattern for atom smashers
already built. Their more conservative estimate of $5.1 billion
still tops the Energy Department's.
   OPERATING COST: Plans call for an annual budget of $270 million.
   FUTURE COSTS: The department estimates the total cost for
building and operating the collider for 25 years at $10.8 billion in
1988 dollars.
   EMPLOYMENT: The project should generate 3,000 permanent jobs and
an additional 4,000 for construction.
   OTHER ECONOMIC IMPACT: Besides project jobs, local businesses
should benefit from the scientific and other spinoffs of a new
industry. Also, the influx of highly trained personnel working on
the collider is expected to improve local socioeconomic and
educational standards.
   THE NEGATIVES: Opponents to the collider fear the project will
siphon much-needed money away from other scientific research. Others
fear detrimental effects on the environment. In addition, 500
residents of Ellis County, Texas, will lose all or some of their
property to the project.
   THE OBSTACLES: The Energy Department must prepare a full-fledged
environmental statement before the selection can be finalized. Funds
could be hard to come by. Congress has not yet appropriated money to
build the collider, providing money only for engineering design and
some research and development items. In all, Congress has
appropriated $205 million for the project.

   Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
has sweetened its bid for Allegheny International Inc. in the battle
with a New York merchant bank to buy the appliance and consumer
products maker.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti on Thursday gave
Allegheny International's board of directors a week to choose
between the two offers. After next Thursday, creditors and
shareholders will be free to propose other rescue plans or present
other prospective buyers.
   The banker Gilliam Joseph Littlejohn & Levy of New York on Monday
proposed a leveraged buyout that includes selling the Sunbeam-Oster
appliance division, reducing Allegheny International by half to a
maker of lawn furniture, barbecue grills, electric blankets, weather
instruments and bathroom scales.
   Both proposals would raise about $700 million to pay creditors.
   The new offer by Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette would substitute
$111 million for bonds it pledged previously to settle debts.
   Allegheny International has been reorganizing under Chapter 11 of
the bankruptcy laws since early this year.

<HEAD>Stockholders OK Transaction To Take Minstar Private</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minstar Inc. stockholders have approved a plan
under which an investor group led by company chairman Irwin Jacobs
will take the firm private for $420 million.
   Under terms of the deal approved Thursday, Jacobs and his
partners will buy all of the firm's outstanding common stock for
$31.50 a share.
   A cash tender offer for about 85.7 percent of the stock was
completed in July.
   The deal represents a healthy premium for Minstar stockholders,
who saw the price of their shares decline from a high of $35 in 1986
to the mid-$20s in the past year.
   Minstar stock closed at $23 a share in over-the-counter trading
Thursday.
   Jacobs, Minstar's largest investor, will get about $77 million
from the transaction _ about $64 million in cash, $10.6 million in
debentures and $2.7 million from cashing in stock options.
   He has said it would be difficult to calculate his exact profits
on the transaction because he acquired his stock during the past
several years at varying prices.
   Jacobs will continue to be the largest shareholder in the new
private company, with about 23 percent of the stock.
   Minneapolis banker Carl Pohlad, a longtime business associate of
Jacobs, will hold an 18 percent stake, according to proxy materials
filed in connection with the deal. Pohlad also will serve on the
board of the private company, which will do business as Genmar
Industries Inc. Genmar was Minstar's boat manufacturing subsidiary.
   Minstar was formed out of the remnants of Arctic Enterprises
Inc., a snowmobile and boat company in Thief River Falls that Jacobs
acquired with Pohlad in 1977.
   Jacobs sometimes used Minstar as a vehicle for corporate
takeovers, which expanded the boat business but also put the company
into the sporting goods, energy and moving and storage businesses.
All those businesses, except for a foreign sporting goods unit
expected to be sold next year, have since been sold.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks U.S. Brewer From Selling Draught Beer in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British brewery on Friday won a high court order
temporarily preventing U.S.-based Anchor Brewing Co. from selling a
rival brand of draught real ale in Britain.
   Cornish Brewery Co. had complained to Justice John Knox that
customers wanting their Newquay Steam Beer could be confused by the
Anchor Steam Beer produced by San Francisco-based Anchor Brewing.
   The judge granted the Cornish brewery an order preventing the
American company from selling or marketing draught Anchor Steam in
this country pending full hearing of the action being brought by
Cornish Brewery.
   Anchor Brewing has been selling bottled version in Britain since
May and was planning to introduce the keg variety.
   The judge said Cornish Brewery had, on the evidence before him,
an arguable case that drinkers wanting draught ``steam'' might be
confused by the two brands.
   But he said bottled versions of the two ales looked very
different and customers were not likely to be confused over them.
   The Cornish company's range of Newquay Steam beers were first
marketed in Britain in 1987, lawyers said. The name ``steam'' comes
from a Cornish slang word for strong lager.
   Anchor Steam was first produced in America in the last century.
The name came from the ``frothy nature'' of the drink, lawyers said.

   Stock prices fell sharply in early trading today,
pressured by weakness in the dollar and continued uncertainty about
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials had tumbled 27.56 points
to 2,087.13 at 11 a.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was off 14.57
points an hour earlier.
   Declining issues lead advancers about 4 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 975 issues down, 241 up and 431 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 44.76 million shares. Traders
said activity was relatively light with many players away for
Veterans Day.
   Analysts said the stock market began selling in reaction to a
steep slide in the U.S. currency on foreign exchange markets.
   ``It just seems that there is some worry about the weakness of
the dollar and also it's still undecided this question of interest
rates,'' Eldon A. Grimm, senior vice president for Birr, Wilson & Co.
   The dollar continued to weaken in overseas trading despite
reported intervention by the central bank of Japan.
   Grimm said the weakness in stock prices also stemmed from
lingering disappointment about the market's failure to respond
positively to a George Bush presidential victory.
   ``People were waiting for a rally to sell and now they're selling
the market today,'' he said.
   The NYSE composite index was off 1.50 to 152.59. At the American
Stock Exchange, the composite index fell 1.61 to 293.02.
   Among the most actively traded issues on the NYSE, IBM was down
1| at 118[, Sears Roebuck was off ] at 41] and RJR Nabisco was
unchanged at 89].

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade in light, cautious trading in the wake of
a sharp selloff in the soybean market in the previous session.
   ``I think everybody's sitting around licking their wounds after
yesterday,'' said Jerry Gidel, a grain market analyst with the G.H.
Miller Division of LIT America Inc. in Chicago.
   Analysts said Thursday's late sell-off was not sparked by any new
supply-demand developments but was led by speculators reacting to
technical developments reflected in price charts.
   Wheat futures prices were pressured in today's session by reports
of beneficial rain in U.S. winter wheat planting areas.
   But expectations of new export business were positive factors in
both the wheat and corn markets. Especially encouraging were reports
that U.S. and Soviet trade officials had met in Washington to
discuss dates for more talks on a long-term grain sale agreement to
replace the one that expired on Sept. 30.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.23{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $2.74{ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $2.16{ a bushel;
and soybeans were 2{ cents lower to 4 cents higher with November at
$7.70{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher with December
at 72.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .18 cent
higher with November at 81.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
lower to .23 cent higher with December at 40.70 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .58 cent higher with February
at 44.55 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<HEAD>Ratings Re-Established on Some WPPSS Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard & Poors Corp., one of the
nation's major debt rating services, today re-established its
ratings on about $5.9 billion bonds sold to finance three Washington
Public Power Supply System nuclear power plants, WPPSS spokesman
Gary Petersen said.
   The move, made possible by legislation signed last week by
President Reagan, removes one of the last impediments to refinancing
high-interest WPPSS bonds, said Petersen.
   Refinancing could save the region $50 million to $70 million a
year, over nearly 30 years, on electricity bills, he said.
   ``We've worked seven and one-half years for this,'' Petersen said.
   The ratings on $5.9 billion worth of bonds for WPPSS plants Nos.
1, 2 and 3 were placed at S&P's AA- rating, which places it among
the services' higher ratings levels.
   The decision does not affect the rating on $2.25 billion in bonds
sold to finance construction on WPPSS plants 4 and 5. They retain
S&P's D rating, its lowest rating designating bonds in default.
   The supply system defaulted on those bonds in 1983. It was the
biggest default in the history of the municipal bond market, and
resulted in a trial that began Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz. Only three
defendants remain of the original list of more than 100 defendants
in that case.
   Debt ratings serve as a guide to investors who are trying to
judge the chances that bonds will be repaid on time.
   Petersen said Standard & Poors told WPPSS it was able to
re-establish bond ratings because of the bankruptcy bill that became
law on Nov. 3. That measure strengthens the so-called ``China Wall''
between WPPSS plants 1, 2 and 3 and the defaulted plants, Nos. 4 and
5, and assures that creditors on Nos. 4 and 5 cannot attach the
assets of the other three plants.
   The bonds on WPPSS 1, 2 and 3 are protected by a financing
arrangement with the federal Bonneville Power Administration. That
protection did not extend to WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5.
   Petersen said the supply system staff was preparing steps to
return to the bond market.
   ``Our intent is to, hopefully, have a small bond sale by June or
July of next year,'' he said. After that, WPPSS would be expected to
sell other bonds, sold in the late 1970s and early 1980s and some of
which carry an interest rate as high as 15 percent.
   One piece of legislation critical to the supply system's
refinancing plans is the technical corrections amendment to the 1986
Tax Reform Act. It has passed Congress and must be approved by
President Reagan by early next week, said Petersen.
   That measure would allow advance sale of $2 billion of WPPSS
high-interest bonds, and is necessary for refinancing the bonds on
WPPSS plants Nos. 1 and 3. Bonds on No. 2 can not be sold in
advance, under the tax reform act.
   Of the five WPPSS plants, No. 2 is operating, Nos. 1 and 3 are
mothballed partially complete, and Nos. 4 and 5 were abandoned.

<HEAD>Prospects for Antitrust, Tax Changes Under Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the current generation of buyout and merger
mavens, hands-off antitrust policies and laws that allow generous
tax writeoffs are the grease that keeps their deal machine humming.
   But as George Bush emerges from the shadow of Ronald Reagan and
heads to the White House, some experts believe his more moderate
ways might put a damper on the free-market wheeling and dealing that
flourished under his predecessor.
   The burst of deals announced in the past month _ including some
of the biggest in history and many between competitors in the same
industry _ has been fueled in part by fear that any change under a
new administration will be a turn for the worse.
   ``People are doing deals just to get under the wire,'' said
Joseph Bartlett, a partner in the law firm Gaston & Snow and a
former undersecretary of commerce in the Johnson administration.
   ``They don't know if they're going to get hit with a left hook or
a right hook, so they're saying, `Let's do the deal now.'''
   When it comes to antitrust issues, however, companies may have
little to fear. The pendulum began to swing toward looser
enforcement in the 1970s. Under the Reagan adminstration, there have
been no challenges to vertical mergers _ those between customers and
their suppliers _ or to combinations of unrelated companies, noted
Robert Pitofsky, dean of Georgetown University Law Center.
   Even more telling, between 1982 and 1986 the government
challenged less than 1 percent of deals large enough to require
antitrust approval, he said.
   So-called horizontal mergers _ those betweeen companies in the
same industry _ have proliferated in this environment. Campeau
Corp., for example, had little regulatory difficulty acquiring
Federated Department Stores Inc. for $6.6 billion earlier this year,
even though the Canadian firm has extensive retail operations in the
United States.
   Although such combinations may go against the academic grain, the
ranks of defenders of these deals are legion.
   ``Antitrust policy depends on the market, and 20 years ago the
market was the good ol' U.S.A.,'' Bartlett said. ``We were almost
totally oriented toward domestic markets, and there was little
offshore competition. The idea of a Philip Morris-Kraft combination
20 years ago would have been ludicrous, and it wouldn't even have
been proposed.''
   Today, however, Philip Morris and Kraft can defend their $13.1
billion merger as an attempt to compete with Unilever, the giant
Swiss foods conglomerate.
   (Both Philip Morris and Kraft are cooperating with government
requests for information necessary for an antitrust review.)
   ``If we're really going to compete in world trade, there has to
be some room for large companies claiming efficiencies,'' Pitofsky
said. At the same time, he believes that if an industry has just
three or four major players, ``it's very doubtful that two have to
merge in order to compete effectively.''
   What several experts believe is likely to result under the Bush
administration is a slight tightening, and it is happening already.
   ``In the last year there's been some pressure from Congress, and
there have been far more investigations by the Federal Trade
Commission and the Justice Department,'' Pitofsky said.
   In one recent case, the FTC subpoenaed the Rales brothers, who
have launched a tender offer for St. Louis-based Interco Inc., on
possible antitrust violations.
   Yet while a few showcase investigations might stop a merger here
and there, ``it will be difficult to put the toothpaste back in the
tube as far as antitrust policy is concerned,'' according to
Bartlett.
   On the tax front, the pressure for change may be more intense.
Experts note that the government essentially is financing mergers,
acquisitions and leveraged buyouts by allowing companies to deduct
the interest they pay on debt, including the junk bonds that finance
some deals.
   Those who fear corporate America is so deep in debt that making
interest payments ultimately will come at the expense of spending on
research and development are calling for changes in the tax laws.
   One simple alteration would be reducing the interest deduction
based on the amount of debt outstanding. But even Beryl Sprinkel,
President Reagan's chief economic adviser, was rebuffed in his
suggestion two years ago that tax incentives be devised that favor
stock issues over debt.
   Current law is further biased against equity by requiring
corporations to pay taxes on their profits, while shareholders also
pay taxes on the dividends they receive.
   Bush has partially addressed the issue by proposing a reduction
in the capital gains tax from 33 percent to 15 percent, which would
be an indirect way to encourage financing through the sale of stock.
   Experts say the government is likely to tread carefully on these
issues, because any change could have a dramatic effect on the stock
market. Changing the way companies finance deals is likely to alter
just how much money companies are willing to pay to acquire other
companies.
   ``The government doesn't want to see the stock market collapse.
If you take out the deal flavor _ the stock buybacks and mergers _
you could see an enormous drop in the Dow'' Jones average of 30
industrials, the key market barometer, Bartlett said.

   In other business news this past week:
   _George Bush's victory in the U.S. presidential race, although
welcomed by the markets, failed to rally the weakening dollar. Stock
and bond prices were also depressed immediately after the election
as worries emerged over how the new president will deal with the
nation's trade and budget deficits.
   _The government said wholesale price inflation slowed to zero
last month as food costs dropped for the first time since February.
Another report showed Americans took out $1.88 billion more in
consumer debt than they paid off in September.
   _A real estate trade group said the booming housing market in the
Northeast cooled off in the July-September quarter, while prices of
existing homes rebounded in the industrial Midwest.
   _Texas beat out six other states to capture the $4.4 billion
superconducting super collider, which, if Congress finds the money
to build it, would be the largest scientific instrument ever
constructed.
   _California's Supreme Court temporarily blocked deep cuts in auto
insurance rates mandated by a proposition approved by state voters
in Tuesday's election.
   _Pillsbury Co. said it would spin off its troubled Burger King
subsidiary under a plan the company says is better for shareholders
than the $5.23 billion takeover offer from Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC. A judge upheld Pillsbury's poison pill defense
against a hostile takeover but said the company should negotiate
with Grand Met.
   _RJR Nabisco Inc., target of a $20 billion takeover bid, a rival
proposal from its own management and a possible third bid, invited
suitors to consider sweetening their offers. A special corporate
committee set a Nov. 18 deadline for submission of proposals.
   _Trans World Airlines Inc. said its president, D. Joseph Corr,
resigned in a management realignment. TWA owner Carl Icahn, who
continues as chairman, was reportedly looking for an acquisition to
bolster TWA's routes and fleet of aircraft. Separately, the
government denied a request that it investigate the economic fitness
of TWA.
   _Time Inc. said it plans to enlarge its entertainment and
television operations and expand aggressively outside the United
States to keep pace with a foreign-led consolidation of the media
business.
   _Chrysler Corp. established a new office of the chairman to pave
the way for a successor to 64-year-old Chairman Lee A. Iacocca.
Gerald Greenwald was named the new vice chairman.
   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and former White House chief of
staff Howard Baker said they had conferred about Drexel's internal
operations, but denied a report that the discussions were related to
a criminal investigation of the Wall Street investment giant.
   _The U.S. Postal Service said it was considering a high-speed
money order service that would compete with Western Union Corp.
   _GTE Corp. said it would cut nearly 14,000 jobs over the next
five years as a result of a restructuring of its telephone
operations.
   _Chubb Corp. agreed to a $48 million settlement covering farmers
in 10 Midwestern states who sued when their applications for 1988
drought insurance were denied.
   _The Reagan administration removed most of the remaining bans
imposed 47 years ago on at-home production by the garment industry.
New regulations eliminating the homework prohibitions take effect
Jan. 8.
   _The Supreme Court upheld the authority of the states to tax
corporate income derived from sales of oil and natural gas extracted
from offshore wells under federal jurisdiction.
   _The Agriculture Department said corn production is expected to
total 4.67 billion bushels this year, 3 percent above last month's
forecast but still a drop of 34 percent from the 1987 crop.

   Stock prices continued broadly lower in afternoon
trading today, pressured by a declining dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 26.50 points to
2,088.19 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator had been off 30.05
points an hour earlier.

Stock Exchange, with 1,120 issues down, 315 up and 447 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 89.76 million shares. Traders
said activity was light with many players away for Veterans Day.
   Analysts said the stock market began selling in reaction to a
steep slide in the U.S. currency in foreign exchange markets,
despite reported intervention by the central bank of Japan early in
the day.
   ``The market is doing awful,'' said Emmanuel Geronimous, senior
vice president at Lehman Hutton Inc. ``We have the dollar down big,
bonds down and the (stock) market broke 2,100. A general malaise
continues to pervade the market.''
   Analysts said investors also were nervous in anticipation of a
possible move by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the
wake of the presidential election.
   The NYSE composite index was off 1.70 to 152.39. At the American
Stock Exchange, the composite market index fell 2.29 to 292.34.
   Among the most actively traded issues on the NYSE, there were
losses across the board. IBM was down 1} to 118, Sears Roebuck was
off ] to 41] and Exxon had lost | to 43{. While most blue-chip
issues were lower, Prime Computer had gained } to 15~ amid takeover
speculation.

<HEAD>Treasury Auction is Pleasant Surprise, But Falling Dollar Hits
Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the proverbial good news and bad news for
the edgy bond market this past week.
   The government's quarterly refunding auctions went better than
expected, with yields on 3-year and 10-year Treasury notes falling
to the lowest levels in many months. Yields move in the opposite
direction of bond prices.
   But the dollar's slide to five-month lows took a big bite out of
that benefit, by sparking fears that the Federal Reserve could nudge
interest rates higher to bolster the U.S. currency.
   ``We're seeing definitely a fear of the dollar's deterioration,''
said Jay Goldinger, a principal of Capital Insight Inc., an
investment firm in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   There was even speculation about an imminent increase in the
Fed's key discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to
financial institutions. The talk hasn't yet escalated into ``disco
fever,'' analysts say, but it makes a shaky bond market even more
jumpy.
   The market already had the jitters on account of Tuesday's
presidential election: both before and after. It was nervous before
the election because of uncertainty about the outcome, then Bush's
victory stirred up worries about how he would deal with critical
problems like the budget and trade deficits and with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
   ``The election results are not conducive to a kinder and gentler
bond market,'' said David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial
Services in Chicago, paraphrasing one of Bush's campaign slogans.
Bond prices were driven lower by the prospect of political
``gridlock'' between the new Republican president and the
Democrat-majority Congress, he noted.
   The Treasury auctions were a bright spot on the otherwise bleak
landscape for the bond market.
   The three auctions, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, formed
the government's latest quarterly bond sale to help finance the $2.6
trillion national debt. The issues are sold to Wall Street's biggest
brokers, who later sell them to the public in the secondary market.
   On Election Day Tuesday, the average yield on 3-year notes fell
to 8.59 percent. That was down from 8.77 percent at the last
comparable auction on Aug. 9 and was the lowest rate since 3-year
notes averaged 8.23 percent on May 10.
   The momentum was sustained on Wednesday, when 10-year notes were
sold at an average yield of 8.94 percent, down from 9.27 percent at
the last such auction on Aug. 10. Rates on 10-year notes haven't
been that low since they hit 8.21 percent on Feb. 3.
   The auction results were ``pretty decent,'' said Kevin Flanagan,
a money- market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``That gave
us a little help.''
   Helping the auctions, in turn, was the absence of the Treasury's
closely watched 30-year bond.
   As was the case in last quarter's auction, the government lacked
the authority to issue any more long bonds. However, the Treasury
hopes to sell $9 billion of them later this month or in early
December after President Reagan signs an authorizing tax bill.
   Analysts point out that the absence of the long-term bond
improved the auction results because it's a high-risk issue and
difficult to adjust in front of changing economic circumstances.
   In addition, Goldinger noted, it meant there simply was ``less
paper to auction.''
   In place of the 30-year bonds, the Treasury auctioned on Thursday
37-day cash management bills. They were sold at an average discount
rate of 8.07 percent.
   The bills are intended to help smooth the flow of government
revenue until the Treasury can issue the 30-year bonds.

   Eastman Kodak Co. will give its 77,300
U.S. employees a share of a record $263 million company bonus next
year, company officials announced Friday.
   The company's board approved the bonus, which Kodak calls the
``wage dividend,'' on Friday. It will be paid to employees on March
10, 1989, said Kodak spokesman Ron Roberts.
   The average worker will receive several thousand dollars,
although the exact amount depends on a person's salary.
   The previous record for a Kodak bonus was $254 million, approved
in 1983 and paid in March 1984.
   The wage dividend is related to cash dividends declared on Kodak
stock. When dividends are up, so is the company bonus.
   The board declared a cash dividend Friday of 50 cents a share,
bringing the total for the year to $1.90 compared with $1.71 for the
same period last year.
   The wage dividend is a Kodak benefit established in 1912 by
company founder George Eastman, who called it ``extra pay for extra
good work.''
   It has been paid annually ever since except for 1934, a
depression year.

   A George Bush presidency should have little impact on most
commodities markets but the futures industry as a whole is relieved
by the election results, which appear to have weakened the forces
favoring more regulation.
   Particularly cheering, according to Futures Industry Association
President John Damgard, is the likelihood that Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass., will get little support from the Bush administration in his
quest to place regulatory authority for stock-index futures in the
hands of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   All futures trading currently is overseen by the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission, which is a part of the Agriculture
Department. Markey, who did not return calls seeking an interview
for this article, has called the CFTC ``lax'' in its regulatory
approach and described it as ``bystander'' during the October 1987
stock market crash.
   An ally of defeated Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis, Markey ``may be forced to be less ambitious or voracious in
his attempts to transfer jurisdiction to the SEC by knowing that
George Bush won't be so anxious to go along with that,'' Damgard
said in a telephone interview from his Washington office.
   Stock-index futures, which are heavily traded on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and offered on a number of other U.S. futures
exchanges, are hedging instruments that investors can use as
insurance against losses in the stock market. But some contend they
encourage reckless speculation and that they contributed to the
collapse of the stock market last year.
   Stock-index futures traders buy and sell baskets of stocks for
delivery on a future date at a specified price. Because they are
derived from the stock market, Markey and others say they should be
regulated by the SEC, which oversees stock trading.
   But futures industry leaders say the SEC does not understand the
futures business. And they say giving the agency jurisdiction over
stock-index futures would needlessly expand the federal bureaucracy.
   The futures industry says its relentless lobbying on the issue
has won them an invaluable ally in Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, who headed the post-crash panel that recommended better
coordination of the stock and stock-index futures markets.
   ``I basically see a friend in the Treasury Department for the
futures industry,'' Damgard said.
   Futures industry leaders also say they expect Bush to retain
Wendy Gramm _ an opponent of additional regulation _ as chairwoman
of the CFTC. And there are murmurings that SEC Chairman David Ruder,
who has sought SEC jurisdiction over stock-index futures, will be
replaced.
   The issue is expected to come to a head next year when the CFTC
comes up for recertification.
   Here is how Bush's election likely will affect various
commodities markets:
   _PRECIOUS METALS: ``I think the gold market will be watching what
Bush does and how the currency markets react to it,'' said John
Norris, chief precious metals trader with Citibank in New York.
Analysts said continued weakness in the dollar could lead to higher
inflation and higher metals prices but the Federal Reserve could
counterbalance those effects by raising interest rates.
   _GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: ``Nothing,'' said Cathy Leow, vice
president of grain and soybean trading with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York. ``There'll be no change in policies in
the short term and so there should be no change in the market.''
   _LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: ``It doesn't really change anything,'' said
Charles Levitt, senior livestock market analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   _ENERGY: ``Very little,'' said James Ritterbusch, vice president
of trading and research with the Carson Petroleum Co., a
Chicago-area oil distributor. ``Any domestic U.S. energy policy
shifts will be easily outweighed by international factors, namely
OPEC overproduction. That's the key factor in this market at the
present time.''

<HEAD>Reynolds Heir Criticizes RJR Nabisco Executives</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A grandson of tobacco company founder
R.J. Reynolds has accused RJR Nabisco Inc. executives of trying to
amass personal fortunes through the bidding war for the tobacco and
consumer products giant.
   ``It is clear that the purpose of this transaction is to make a
large profit for these executives by selling off certain of the
company's businesses and assets, and by taking other steps to
restructure and increase the profitability and value of the
company,'' Smith W. Bagley said in a letter to Charles Hugel,
chairman of a special committee reviewing bids for the conglomerate.
   Bagley, an heir to the Reynolds tobacco fortune, said the letter
was written on behalf of himself ``and certain other stockholders of
RJR Nabisco.''
   Last month RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson announced a plan
to take the company private in a $17 billion leveraged buyout. If
the group were successful, he and other top executives could end up
owning 20 percent of the company, published reports have said. That
equity would be worth several billion dollars.
   Johnson has denied claims the management group would be
excessively compensated in such a buyout.
   Bagley, who is a substantial stockholder in RJR Nabisco, outlined
steps he said the company took to pave the way for the management
buyout plan, including:
   _RJR Nabisco's purchase in April of 21 million shares for $53.50
each. (The company's stock currently is trading in the $89-a-share
range.
   _The adoption of a `poison pill' defense to thwart outside
bidders ``not acceptable to management.''
   _The preparation ``at stockholder expense of financial studies,
analyses and projections concerning a restructuring of the company
and the sale of certain businesses.''
   Bagley said the management group tried to discourage bidding by
the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which launched a
$20.23 billion tender offer, and by a group led by Forstmann Little
& Co., which has expressed interest in making an offer.
   ``For the executive management of this company ... to devise a
plan to take the company private and to divert for themselves
profits properly accruing to the public stockholders and then to
undermine competitive bidding, would be self-dealing and a breach of
fiduciary duty,'' he said.
   ``The stockholders have been paying these top executives, and
paying them handsomely, to run the company for the stockholders'
benefit and not to acquire it at the stockholders' expense.''
   A spokesman for RJR Nabisco declined to comment on the letter.

   Stock prices fell further in afternoon trading
today, pressured by a declining dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 37.88 points to
2,076.81 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was 26.50 points
lower an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers about 4 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,211 issues down, 298 up and 399 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 112.78 million shares. Traders
said activity was light with many players away for Veterans Day.
   Analysts said the stock market began selling in reaction to a
steep slide in the U.S. currency in foreign exchange markets,
despite reported intervention by the central bank of Japan early in
the day.
   ``The market is doing awful,'' said Emmanuel Geronimous, senior
vice president at Lehman Hutton Inc. ``We have the dollar down big,
bonds down and the (stock) market broke 2,100. A general malaise
continues to pervade the market.''
   Analysts said investors also were nervous in anticipation of a
possible move by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the
wake of the presidential election.
   The NYSE composite index was off 2.41 to 151.68. At the American
Stock Exchange, the composite market index fell 3.02 to 291.61.
   Among the most actively traded issues on the NYSE, there were
losses across the board. IBM was down 2] to 117], RJR Nabisco was
off ] to 89 and Sears Roebuck fell | to 41[. While most blue-chip
issues were lower, Prime Computer had gained } to 15~ amid takeover
speculation.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures closed substantially
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid disappointment over
the slow pace of export sales of those commodities.
   But wheat futures finished mixed amid indications of growing
foreign demand for U.S. wheat.
   Technical factors keyed to Thursday's late collapse in the
soybean and corn markets also contributed to the sell-off Friday in
those markets.
   ``We were down so much yesterday and we just saw some
follow-through from that,'' said Jon Horton, a market analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Thursday's declines were said to have stemmed mainly from
bearishly interpreted price-chart formations. But some observers
said the drop in prices may have indicated that a rumored sale of 2
million metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union had not been
completed.
   That view reflected the market's disappointment that last week's
sale to the Soviets of a large amount of U.S. soybeans had not been
followed by more large Soviet purchases.
   The grain markets rallied last week in anticipation of more sales
and ``we're just coming down from that,'' Horton said.
   At the close, wheat was 3\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.22 a bushel; corn was 5
cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.69{ a bushel; oats
were 2{ cents to 3} cents lower with December at $2.12 a bushel; and
soybeans were 1\ cents to 12 cents lower with November at $7.62 a

<DATELINE>CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased coke production at USX Corp.'s
Clairton Works should be allowed only if the company reduces air
pollution to safe levels, two environmental groups say.
   The Residents Against Chemical Environment and the Group Against
Smog and Pollution said Thursday that USX shouldn't be allowed to
fire up two rebuilt coke batteries without first cutting emissions
from the 10 batteries now in operation.
   The two new batteries would create 175 new full-time jobs. The
batteries contain ovens to bake coal to produce coke, an ingredient
used in making steel. The Clairton Works in the nation's largest
coke plant.
   ``Certainly, a corporation with the resources of USX is capable
of making coke in a safe manner and they should be required to do
so,'' said GASP President Walter Goldburg.
   The Allegheny County Health Department said air monitoring showed
levels of fine, inhalable particles downwind from the plant exceeded
government standards on 12 occasions in the past year. Also, levels
of benzene, a toxic pollutant, have averaged nearly 10 times a
proposed state guideline for the chemical.
   Paul Masciantonio, vice president of environmental affairs for
USX's USS division, said company consultants reveal no evidence the
factory is causing health problems.
   He said the company is installing additional air pollution
controls at a cost of about $30 million under a federal court
consent decree.
   USX spokesman Thomas Ferrall said the company has spent more than
$150 million on air and water pollution controls at the plant during
the last 15 years.

   Stock prices closed sharply lower in fairly quiet
holiday trading today, pressured by a declining dollar and investor
concerns about the economy.
   Analysts said the stock market began selling early in the day in
reaction to a steep slide in the U.S. currency in foreign exchange
markets in Europe and Tokyo, despite reported intervention by the
central bank of Japan.
   The currency continued its slide in U.S. trading, pulling down
bonds and stocks.
   ``We have the dollar down big, bonds down and the (stock) market
broke 2,100,'' said Emmanuel Geronimous, a senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``A general malaise continues to pervade
the market.''
   Except for the dollar, analysts said there were no pressing
factors to explain the market's sharp drop.
   ``There's no special reason for it except a number of technical
support numbers were broken. The bond market was virtually closed
because of Veterans Day,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of
A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. ``The market is showing no respect...which
has increased the fear factor.''
   Analysts said in the post-election environment, investors had
little conviction to commit their funds in the face of mounting
questions about the future under a new president.
   Concerns about the economy, particularly the federal budget
deficit, and how the president-elect will work to solve those
problems also continued to erode investor confidence, observers said.
   But some analysts said they were surprised by the market's
weakness.
   ``There was an unusual amount of decline despite the Japanese
stock market reaching a record high,'' said Eldon A Grimm, senior
vice president, Birr, Wilson & Co.
   Grimm said that many investors were still disappointed that the
market did not rally following the victory of George Bush, the
market's choice for president.
   ``People were waiting for a rally to sell and since it didn't
come they were selling today,'' Grimm said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar continued its downward spiral Friday
after what dealers termed half-hearted central bank intervention
failed to support the currency.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
bullion was bid at $421.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from
$418.20 late Thursday.
   In domestic dealings, the dollar finished substantially beneath
its highs for the week, reached on Tuesday. The currency stood at a
10-month low against the Japanese yen and at five-month lows against
the West German mark and British pound.
   Trading around the world was extremely thin. In the United
States, banks and government offices were closed for Veterans Day.
The financial markets were closed in France and Belgium for
Armistice Day, and in Canada, government offices and banks were shut
for Remembrance Day.
   Dealers noted that central bank intervention failed to halt the
dollar's slide downward. ``It was not enough,'' said Gary Taratunio,
a trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   ``The whole market is waiting to test the resolve of the central
banks, and given that, unless there is strong intervention or policy
statements by the new Bush cabinet, the dollar will continue to
slide,'' Taratunio added.
   Statements made in Europe by George Gould, a U.S. Treasury
official, and U.S. Commerce Secretary William Verity indicated there
is support for the dollar at its current, depressed levels.
   Gould said in London that while the market has to seek its own
level, ``we, as a matter of policy, have no interest in seeing the
dollar lower.'' And in a West German television interview, Verity
said the currency's present level was good for the Group of Seven
industrialized nations. The G-7 nations are the United States,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   The statements gave traders further reason to sell their dollar
holdings.
   Dealers continue to focus on the nation's trade and budget
deficits. Taratunio predicted dollar-selling would subside next week
as dealers square their positions ahead of Wednesday's release of
trade deficit figures for September.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 123.70 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted at 122.65 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 122.70
yen, from 124.05 yen on Thursday. The dollar had finished at 125.70
on Tuesday.
   In London, the dollar fell sharply against the British pound. It
cost $1.8137 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7970 late
Thursday. In New York it cost $1.8110 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.7975.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.7355 West German marks, down from 1.7540; 1.4590 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4745; 5.9400 French francs, down from 5.9970;
1,307.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.2218 Canadian dollars,
unchanged.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.7345 West German marks, down from 1.7565; 1.4553 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4765; 5.9285 French francs, down from 6.0065;
1.9551 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9825; 1,296.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,311.00, and 1.2225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2246.
   Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
finished at $421.60 a troy ounce, up from $419.00 on Thursday.
   In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $419.95 a troy
ounce, compared with late Thursday's $419.75. In Zurich, gold also
moved up to a late bid price of $420.20, compared with $419.70 late
Thursday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.18 to a late bid of
$421.05.
   Silver bullion fell. On the New York Comex, silver closed at
$6.389 a troy ounce, down from $6.411 on Thursday. In London the
metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.45 a troy ounce,
compared with Thursday's $6.48.

   Revco D.S. Inc., the national drug store
chain that filed for bankruptcy protection four months ago, said
Friday it would open 11 new stores and relocate two others by the
end of the year.
   ``Opening these new locations is another signal that Revco
continues to be a serious long-term player in the drug store
industry,'' said Carl A. Bellini, executive vice president.
   The new stores are located in Clemmons, Raleigh and Spencer,
N.C., Pawleys Island, S.C., Ennis, Texas, Kingsland, Ga.,
Tallahassee, Fla., and Forest, Chesapeake, Christiansburg and
Elkton, Va.
   The additions and relocations will bring to 20 the number of new
units opened or relocated since Revco's bankruptcy filing, Bellini
said.
   Revco filed for Chapter 11 protection on July 28, about a month
after it failed to make an interest payment on about $700 million in
outstanding high-  risk junk bonds used to finance its $1.5 billion
leveraged buyout in 1986.
   The Twinsburg-based company sought protection from creditors
after talks with bondholders broke down, becoming the largest
company involved in a leveraged buyout to take such action.
   Revco has about 1,950 stores in 27 states.

   Southland Corp. reported Friday that it lost $46.8
million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 because of interest and
other expenses related to the leveraged buyout of the company last
December.
   Southland, the nation's largest convenience store chain, had a
net loss of $3.7 million in the same period in 1987.
   But the company stressed that different accounting systems were
used during the two periods and the figures are not directly
comparable. Southland said it earned $17.5 million in July 1987,
then lost $21.2 million in the following two months.
   Revenue in the third quarter was $2.18 billion. In the same three
months of last year, Southland's revenue was $2.14 billion.
   The company has completed a divestiture program designed to raise
capital to repay money borrowed for the buyout by its founding
family and management. Southland has sold 910 convenience stores and
has signed agreements to sell 168 more.
   ``Through early November, we have already repaid approximately
$880 million of our leveraged buyout bank debt, meeting our
principal repayment obligations on that debt up to December 1989,''
said Southland President Jere Thompson.
   In the first nine months of the year, Southland had a net loss of
$179.2 million. In 1987, the company earned $90.1 million in the
seven months before the buyout, then lost $21.2 million in the two
months afterward.
   Southland still has 7,000 7-Eleven and other convenience store
units in the United States and Canada that are supported by five
distribution centers and six food division plants. There also are
more than 5,000 7-Eleven stores operated by licensees and affiliates.

<HEAD>Copper Market Steadies As Peru Strike Picture Blurs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices closed mixed Friday on New York's Commodity
Exchange after a steep morning sell-off as prospects for settlement
of a 3{-week-old nationwide miners' strike in Peru appeared to
diminish.
   On other markets, in generally light Veterans' Day trading,
precious metals were mixed; stock-index futures fell sharply; grains
and soybeans were mostly lower; energy futures were mixed; cattle
futures were lower and pork futures were mixed.
   Copper settled 1.65 cents lower to .10 cent higher with the
contract for spot delivery at $1.432 a pound and the active December
contract at $1.351 a pound.
   The December contract's dramatic recovery from a 5.45-cent
decline early in the session suggested the bull market for copper
may not be over despite Thursday's steep losses of nearly 9 cents a
pound, analysts said.
   ``The fact that the market closed so much off its lows today, on
Friday, when you normally would get a lot of nervous selling ahead
of the weekend, is very constructive,'' said Bernard Savaiko, metals
market analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Thursday's decline was sparked by reports that the Southern Peru
Copper Co., the largest copper-mining firm in the world's
sixth-largest copper-producing nation, had come to contract terms
with some of its non-mining employees.
   It appeared on Thursday that a settlement with the miners also
was imminent. But on Friday, Southern Peru miners reportedly
rejected the company's offer of substantial wage increases.
   ``The miners want to have a united front _ they want a united
mine workers' union and they want a nationwide settlement,'' Savaiko
said.
   The Peruvian strike has been a major factor in spot copper's rise
from about $1 a pound in August to the recent record high of $1.538.
But copper supplies have been growing tighter for about 1{ years,
and that situation is expected to continue.
   With the Peruvian picture turning muddy, traders were looking
ahead to Monday's weekly report on London Metal Exchange warehouse
stocks of copper.
   Savaiko saisd the exchange is expected to report a 5,000- to
7,000-metric-ton decline in its copper stocks in the past week.
   Precious metals futures were mixed on the Comex, with gold up
moderately and silver slightly lower.
   The light activity and narrow trading ranges were surprising in
light of the dollar's weakness and the stock market's plunge,
analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.30 to $2.60 higher with December at $423.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.2 cents lower across the board with
December at $6.418 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures moved sharply lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, pressured by the declining dollar and investor concerns
about the economy, analysts said.
   Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures settled 5.50 points to
5.76 points lower with the December contract at 268.60.
   Corn and soybean futures finished substantially lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid disappointment over the slow pace of
export sales of those commodities.
   But wheat futures finished mixed on indications of growing
foreign demand for U.S. wheat, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with December at
$4.21} a bushel; corn was 4} cents lower to { cent higher with
December at $2.69} a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3} cents lower
with December at $2.12\ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 11{
cents lower with November at $7.61{ a bushel.
   Energy futures finished the week mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on continuing concern about the OPEC meetings coming up
later this month, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 11 cents
lower with February at $13.87 a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent to
.27 cent higher with December at 44.01 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .75 cent lower with December at 46.65 cents
a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures were mostly
lower on sluggish cash fundamentals and renewed concerns that the
European Economic Community would ban imports of U.S. meats
containing growth hormones, analysts said.
   Hog futures fell on expectations that marketings would increase
sharply next week while frozen pork bellies contracts were supported
by technical factors.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .60 cent lower with December at
72.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with November at 81.35 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with December at 40.50 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .08 cent to .30 cent higher with February
at 44.35 cents a pound.

   The Soviet Union signed a preliminary agreement
Friday with a Japanese-led consortium in a deal that could lead to
the building of a huge petrochemical complex in western Siberia.
   The project, if completed, would be one of the largest joint
ventures the Soviets have entered into with foreign companies since
liberalized regulations were implemented last year to make such
undertakings possible.
   Mitsubishi Corp., a major Japanese trading company that is the
lead company in the consortium, estimated the cost at $5 billion,
Japan's Kyodo News Service said.
   The award to the Mitsubishi-led consortium was a setback for
Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, which had announced in
June it was putting together a consortium of Western chemical
companies to do the project at the request of the Soviet government.
   ``The Japanese offered such attractive terms that the project was
awarded to them,'' Frank Ashley, an Occidental spokesman, said in a
statement Friday attributed to the company's chairman, Armand
Hammer. Occidental later said the company did not know the terms of
the Japanese offer.
   Occidental said it was still leading two other big petrochemical
projects in the Soviet Union.
   Located in the area of the Nizhnevartovsk oil fields, 1,500 miles
east of Moscow, the proposed complex would include 15 highly
automated factories capable of annual production of up to 1 million
tons of chemical products, including structural materials and
polymers, the official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The products would be used in the space, aircraft-building,
automobile, eletrical engineering and other industries, Tass said.
   Tass said the agreement called for the Soviets and the foreign
group to complete by the end of March a feasibility study on
building the complex.
   Plans call for the complex, if it is authorized, to be completed
by the year 2000.
   Also in the consortium along with Mitsubishi are Chiyoda Corp.
and Mitsui and Co. of Japan.
   There were conflicting reports late Friday about whether
Combustion Engineering Inc. of Stamford, Conn., was involved in the
consortium. ``I can't tell you whether we're in or out,'' admitted
Mark Baxter, a company spokesman.
   Another planned chemical complex in Tobolsk would supply the
intermediate materials for the new complex, Kyodo said.
   Feasibility studies for the Tobolsk project are already being
conducted by a consortium made up of Combustion Engineering,
McDermott International Inc. of the United States, and Mitsubishi
and Mitsui, Kyodo said. It said that project could cost $10 billion.
   The Soviet government hopes to finish construction of the two
projects by the end of the 1990s, and plans to export at least 40
percent of their products to earn foreign exchange, Kyodo said.
   Western governments and businesses have expressed concern that
the anticipated Soviet exports could depress world prices for some
petrochemical products.
   The Soviet Union has hoped to involve Japan more in the economic
development of Siberia, which has rich deposits of oil and natural
gas.
   The agreement of intent was signed in Moscow by Soviet Chemical
Industry Minister Yuri Bespalov and Takeshi Egyshi, managing
director of Mitsubishi Corp., Tass said.
   Tass said the complex would cost 5 billion rubles. That is about
$8 billion at official exchange rates, but less in terms of the
actual value of the ruble.
   ollar values are difficult to calculate because the ruble is not
convertible into other currencies, accounting for the differences in
the statements by Tass and Kyodo.
   Occidental still is involved in a proposed venture to build a
petrochemical complex at the Soviet city of Tengiz near the Caspian
Sea along with the Italian companies Montedison SpA and Ente
Nazionale Idrocarburi and Japan's Marubeni Corp. A feasibility
project on that is expected to be completed early in 1989.
   Occidental's other Soviet project is with the Ministry of
Chemical Industry for a polyvinyl chloride plant at Kalush near the
Czechoslovak border.

<HEAD>Snohomish Agress to WPPSS Case Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington utility has agreed to a
settlement for its part in the Washington Public Power Supply System
securities fraud case, leaving only three private companies as
defendants in the two-month-old trial.
   In agreeing late Thursday to settle, the Snohomish County Public
Utility District joined 14 other Washington state utilities who
reached a $226 million settlement with WPPSS bondholders last week.
   The agreement also takes Chemical Bank of New York out of the
case. Chemical, a trustee for bondholders, sued only the utilities.
A class of more than 24,000 past and present bondholders sued all
the defendants.
   U.S. District Court Judge Browning, who is presiding over the
case, is expected to sign an order Monday that will formally cut
Snohomish and Chemical Bank from the case.
   He still must hold fairness hearings on the settlements involving
Snohomish and others that were reached before the trial started. If
he rules against the settlements, the parties could end up back in
court retrying the case.
   Snohomish's action leaves three defendants _ a financial advisory
firm and two engineering companies _ in the case brought on by
WPPSS' default on $2.25 billion in municipal bonds in 1983 after the
system scrapped two unfinished nuclear power plants.
   The Snohomish settlement calls for the utility to pay $48.6
million. In turn, the plaintiffs will pay it $2.6 million to retain
the rights to about $20 million in disputed insurance claims.
   Snohomish will pay about $3.5 million for each percentage point
of its 13-percent share of the plants.
   A group of 14 other Washington state utilities settled out of
court Oct. 31 for $181 million, or about $3.7 million for each
percentage point.
   As part of that agreement, the federal Bonneville Power
Administration agreed to add $35 million and Washington state will
add $10 million subject to legislative approval.
   Settlements of about $650 million have been pledged to
bondholders by more than 100 original defendants in the case.
   WPPSS reached a settlement that requires no monetary awards.
   Paul Bernstein, another attorney for the class plaintiffs, said
the latest settlement does not affect its case against the remaining
defendants.
   The plaintiffs maintain that the defendants conspired to lie and
hide information that might have discouraged bond investors.
   Financial adviser Blyth Eastman PaineWebber Inc. faces the same
allegations as did the utilities, Bernstein said. Separate
allegations were made against the two engineering firms, Ebasco
Services Inc. and United Engineers and Contractors Inc.

   Lloyd's of London announced tougher new financial
requirements for its members Friday in an attempt to strengthen the
security of insurance policies written at the underwriting exchange.
   Lloyd's said the new requirements, to go into effect in 1990,
would for the first time raise the deposit required of the
exchange's British members to the same level required of its foreign
members.
   Under the new rules, approved on Friday by the ruling Council of
Lloyd's, new members and those already having declared financial
resources of 250,000 pounds, or about $450,000, or more would need
to deposit funds with the exchange equal to 30 percent of their
``premium limit.'' Previously, the deposit was 20 percent for
British concerns and 28 percent for foreign members.
   The premium limit is the maximum amount of premium that members
are entitled to claim in insurance policies syndicated at Lloyd's.
The limit usually is equal to about 1.5 times a member's declared
financial resources.
   Members with declared resources of between 100,000 pounds, or
$180,000, and 250,000 pounds, or $450,000, will be required to
deposit 40 percent of their premium limit, up from 20 percent for
British members and 28 percent for foreigners.
   Those with declared resources of less than 100,000 pounds, or
$180,000, will be required to deposit 50 percent, up from 30 percent
for British members and 40 percent for foreigners.

   The energy futures market remains mixed in
advance of the upcoming OPEC meetings.
   Contracts for crude oil and unleaded gasoline slipped while
wholesale home heating oil posted slight gains in quiet,
directionless trading Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Many traders had pulled out of the market early because of the
Veterans Day holiday and to prepare for the annual American
Petroleum Institute convention, which starts this weekend.
   But Madison Galbraith, senior trader for Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, said apprehension about the OPEC meetings was largely to
blame for the sluggish trading. ``Right now there is no motivation.
We're just sitting here waiting,'' he said.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled to
hold price and strategy committee meetings next week, while the full
cartel plans to meet the following week. At issue is limiting
production to help boost sagging worldwide oil prices.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, fell 3 cents to close at $13.95 a barrel.
   Among refined petroleum products, the December contract for
wholesale unleaded gasoline settled down 0.75 cent to 46.65 cents a
gallon, while the December contract for wholesale home heating oil
rose 0.13 cent to 44.01 cents a gallon.
